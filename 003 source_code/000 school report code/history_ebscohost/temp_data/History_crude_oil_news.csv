At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Chris Grams. Please go ahead.CHRIS GRAMS, SENIOR DIRECTOR OF CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS, CME GROUP INC.: Good morning, good evening, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We're excited to announce that in Q4 of this year, we'll be introducing a physical WTI Houston crude oil futures contract. At this time, I want to hand the call to Peter Keavey, who's our Global Head of Energy; and Owain Johnson, who's our Managing Director of Energy Research, to provide a few comments, and after that we will open up the line for some Q&A with members of the press. Thank you very much. Pete?PETER KEAVEY, MD AND GLOBAL HEAD OF CRUDE & REFINED ENERGY PRODUCTS, CME GROUP INC.: Thanks, Chris. This is Pete Keavey. I'm the Global Head of Energy at CME Group. The reason why we set up this call is because Owain and myself are in Singapore at APAC and it seemed more convenient. And I just wanted to let you guys know what we announced today and then field some questions.So we sent out the press release, which is very self-explanatory. We are launching a physical-delivered WTI Houston crude oil contract that is for delivery at the enterprise ecosystem in Houston. This contract is fairly unique. It has 3 delivery locations within the enterprise system: ECHO terminal, Genoa Junction and Houston Ship Channel. So it's -- we believe this is serving the growing and very important Houston market. It's been growing both in recent times with the Permian production growth and flows to the Gulf Coast as well as the opening of the export market a few years ago. That market's coming -- becoming more mature. And over the past year, we've gotten increasing feedback from customers that have desired a physical-settled contract to help them hedge the risk and that is how we arrived to where we are today. So we will be launching this contract in Q4.So I'm happy to take any questions based on the release and anything you guys want to hear about. So I'll hand it off to the -- back to the instructor for questions.Questions and AnswersOPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We'll hear from Devika, Kumar of Reuters.DEVIKA KRISHNA KUMAR: I just wanted to ask real quick, if you have any projections on volume or open interests for this contract that you can share, just based on kind of -- I know it's probably preliminary, but any indication on that you have?OWAIN JOHNSON, MD OF ENERGY RESEARCH, CME GROUP INC.: Well, I think -- this is Owain. I would say it's going to be primarily a commercial contract to start with. We're seeing this as something that will be of interest to exporters, producers, and in the import side, maybe some on the financial that are looking at hedging assets. But we think primarily, at first, we're commercial, so I think you should look to model it around some of the U.S. grades we've already launched over the past couple of years, rather than expecting it to be WTI Cushing anytime soon. We're not seeing this Devika, so we're really not seeing this as in anyway a replacement for Cushing, it's an enhancement to Cushing. So we think that the underlying liquidity for the flat price will come from Cushing. And this will be like a locational [desk], that will be liquid in itself, but we still think the primary liquidity will reside in Cushing because that's really the crossroads for the U.S. infrastructure.OPERATOR: (inaudible) Intelligence Group.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I had 2 questions, the first of which is, I wanted to know whether the quality specifications for this new contract are going to be the same as per the existing ones and will adhere to the new recommendations from the Crude Oil Quality Association? And then to revisit the last point that Owain made, so it's not going to replace Cushing, of course, but it -- these proliferation of assessments does seem to speak to almost a bifurcation of the market from one in the mid-Continent to one on the Gulf Coast, and I was wondering if you could address that in any way?PETER KEAVEY: Well, this is Pete. So when you talk about a bifurcation, I think what we're seeing is that market's developing, right? So there is a huge infrastructure build underway in the mid-Continent, which is between Cushing and the Houston export area. So there is certainly an evolving market. Now as that market develops, both in physical infrastructure and also in trading markets, there's clearly going to be some risk that need to be hedged. So the bottom line for us is, the customers have said that they want a contract that can reflect that region -- that particular basis region, which is why we've launched this one or why we're going to launch this one. But that doesn't -- the basis concept in crude oil markets is very common throughout the entire world. So this isn't necessarily anything new for futures' traders or for physical traders, that these risks have existed in many markets and exist in all markets and have since they -- since time immemorial. So this is really just a risk management tool and a way to have physical settlement, price discovery, transparency and liquidity in a location, which is becoming more important to certain areas in the market. So...OWAIN JOHNSON: Yes. I completely agree with Pete. I wouldn't say it's either/or, it's both because every lot we see trade on the grades' market generates a lot of Cushing as well because people hedge the flat price in Cushing and then they hedge an extra lot of spread. So the more liquid that Houston becomes, the more liquid Cushing will become as well because people will trade them together as they complement. So don't think of it as an either/or as an alternative. On the spec side, and what we're looking at the specs is 40 to 44 API and 0.275 sulfur. So it's a little tighter because it's a grade -- it's a coal field grade spec rather than a Cushing blended spec. So it's a little bit of tighter spec, which we think will feed nicely into the export market.PETER KEAVEY: And also reflects the reality of what's trading in that area today.OPERATOR: [John Trunch, Plats Media].UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Actually, my question was just answered, I was just going to ask about why not include the terms Permian or Midland since we've kind of seen the adoptions of these terms that kind of separate WTI coming down to the Gulf Coast from the field itself rather than down from Cushing. And I know you've touched a little bit on the specs there, but my question was really just about why not include the terms Permian or Midland since we seem to now see those kind of almost like as inseparable, WTI and Midland or Permian if it's going for the export market?OWAIN JOHNSON: Yes, it's a good question. I guess, when we set up contacts, we think of them for the very long term. So if you think of TI Cushing, we've only made one specification change since the early '80s. So we are -- we don't want to tie ourselves to any specific grade or brand. We're looking more at generic specification. And with the way that the market's developing so quickly and the infrastructure's developing so quickly, we don't know exactly what those markets are going to look like in 3, 5, 10, 20 years. So that's why we've deliberately gone with a geographical reference, rather than a grade reference. Does that make sense?UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: It does.OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)Next, we'll hear from Sheela Tobben of Bloomberg.SHEELA TOBBEN: So I just wanted to know -- actually Owain, if you could just repeat again why you're having the tighter spec for this specific contract in contrast to the Cushing one? And the other question I had was(technical difficulty)as the U.S. increases its exports, this is going to be a really powerful export benchmark, so we should start to see this being part of the mix in terms of people managing those export economics globally. So I think it's got -- it's got a lot of potential. We're in Singapore as you -- as Pete mentioned, and already this news is getting a very good reception from the Asian market. So we're quite excited about the potential.CHRIS GRAMS: That's great. Well, thank you so much, Owain and Pete. If there are no other questions from the members on the press on the line, we'll invite everyone to have a wonderful rest of their day. You can follow-up with myself or Matt Stroud, who are noted on the media list with any follow-up questions. And we thank you for your time and attention this morning, and this evening, Singapore time.OPERATOR: And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you, all, for your participation.

[ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,bizwire.c86787651,Regional Business News,Enable Midstream Announces Major Expansion of Crude Oil Gathering Business," Enable Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: ENBL) is significantly expanding its crude oil midstream business with today’s announcement of agreements in two of the country’s most active crude plays. In the Anadarko Basin, Enable has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Velocity Holdings, LLC (“Velocity”), an integrated crude oil and condensate gathering and transportation company in the SCOOP and Merge plays, for $442 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. In the Williston Basin, Enable has entered into new contractual commitments for a substantial expansion of the company’s crude and water gathering systems driven by significant producer activity and a backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells from over 90,000 gross acres of dedication.   “Today’s announcements continue Enable’s strategy of extending our reach across the midstream value chain by significantly expanding our crude business,” said Enable Midstream President and CEO Rod Sailor. “The Velocity acquisition builds on Enable’s market-leading Anadarko Basin midstream platform that now offers customers complete wellhead-to-market solutions for both natural gas and crude. The combination of the Velocity acquisition and the expansion of our Williston Basin assets increases the scale and contribution of our crude and water businesses, providing for fee-based growth as producers continue to target crude oil production.”   Taken together, Enable expects the two crude business expansions to generate a 2019 total capital invested to Adjusted EBITDA multiple of approximately 13 times, working down to below a 10-times multiple by 2020. These expansions are expected to be accretive to distributable cash flow per unit starting in 2019.Enable does not expect to raise common equity to finance the Velocity acquisition.   VELOCITY ACQUISITION   The Velocity acquisition builds on Enable’s market-leading natural gas gathering and processing infrastructure position in the prolific SCOOP and Merge plays that have attracted substantial producer activity with some of the best well economics in the country. The Velocity crude and condensate system is comprised of approximately 150 miles of pipeline capable of flowing approximately 225,000 barrels per day (bpd), along with over 400,000 barrels of owned and leased storage and 26 truck bays capable of unloading more than 100,000 bpd. Included in these assets is Velocity’s 60 percent interest in a 26-mile pipeline system joint venture with a third party that owns and operates a refinery connected to the Velocity system. Velocity’s operations are backed by large area dedications and long-term, fee-based contracts with over 2 million acres dedicated from shippers, including acreage dedications from top SCOOP and Merge producers.   The Velocity acquisition will give Enable an integrated crude and natural gas midstream platform in the Anadarko Basin, enhancing Enable’s business development prospects, strengthening relationships with key current customers and providing the opportunity for operational synergies. Producers have dedicated additional rigs to the oil-rich SCOOP and Merge plays over the past year, and the move to pad drilling in these areas is expected to increase demand for crude oil gathering services. As the only integrated crude oil and condensate gathering and transportation system in the SCOOP and Merge plays, the Velocity system is poised for sustained growth from both new customers and the substantial drilling inventory of current customers on the system.   Enable received early termination of the waiting period under the Hart–Scott–Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act on Oct. 19 and expects to close the Velocity acquisition on or about Nov. 1, following the satisfaction of remaining pre-closing conditions.   WILLISTON BASIN EXPANSION   In the Williston Basin, Enable plans to further expand its existing crude oil and water gathering systems to support volumes from over 90,000 gross acres dedicated to Enable in North Dakota’s Dunn and McKenzie counties under long-term, fee-based agreements. Subject to future drilling plans, Enable will add up to 72,000 bpd of crude oil gathering design capacity, increasing total Williston Basin crude gathering capacity to up to approximately 130,000 bpd. Enable expects to start gathering volumes associated with these system expansions in the first half of 2019, including volumes from a significant number of drilled but uncompleted wells.   ABOUT ENABLE MIDSTREAM PARTNERS   Enable owns, operates and develops strategically located natural gas and crude oil infrastructure assets. Enable’s assets include over 13,300 miles of natural gas and crude oil gathering pipelines, approximately 2.6 Bcf/d of processing capacity, approximately 7,800 miles of interstate pipelines (including Southeast Supply Header, LLC of which Enable owns 50 percent), approximately 2,200 miles of intrastate pipelines and eight storage facilities comprising 86.0 billion cubic feet of storage capacity.

[ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,bizwire.c86751419,Regional Business News,Intercontinental Exchange Announces Launch of Permian WTI Crude Oil Futures Deliverable in Houston," Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading operator of global exchanges and clearing houses and provider of data and listings services, announced the launch today of physically delivered Permian WTI (Contract code: HOU) crude oil futures, deliverable in Houston, Texas. Houston has become the pricing center for U.S. crude oil production and exports, and the new Permian WTI futures contract is designed to serve hedging and trading opportunities in this growing market.   With the growth in shale oil production in the Permian basin in West Texas, which is now estimated at 3.5 million barrels a day, and increased U.S. exports alongside growing international demand for light sweet crude oil, Houston has become the central delivery point for U.S. crude. The ICE Permian WTI futures contract is designed to provide price discovery, settlement and delivery at Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P.’s (NYSE: MMP) terminal in East Houston.   “When we were designing the Permian WTI Futures, customers consistently told us that it was critical to offer a high-quality, well known crude oil spec deliverable in Houston, and available for the waterborne export market,” said Jeff Barbuto, Vice President of Oil Markets at ICE. “By selecting Magellan’s East Houston terminal as the delivery point, we’re offering customers a trusted standard for WTI straight from the Permian Basin, and over time, it’s one that we think could develop into a benchmark for other grades to price around.”   “Magellan’s comprehensive Houston distribution system provides delivery options to all local refineries throughout the ship channel and Texas City and access to export capabilities at our Seabrook Logistics crude oil marine facility,” said Mark Roles, Magellan’s vice president of commercial crude oil. “The new ICE contract provides customers with extensive delivery options, pricing transparency, and liquidity in the Houston Gulf Coast crude oil market while increasing demand for Magellan’s pipeline and storage services.”   Later today, ICE plans to list 36 months of flat price Permian WTI (HOU) contracts and a full matrix of calendar spreads, as well as inter-commodity spreads for HOU/Brent and HOU/WTI.   ICE is home to the world’s leading global crude and refined oil markets. Half of the world’s oil and refined futures are traded on ICE’s markets, including futures and options on the global benchmark ICE Brent, the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the Asian benchmark Platts Dubai crude, Gasoil, Heating Oil and RBOB Gasoline, as well as more than 500 additional grades and oil products.

0,All Things Considered (NPR). 05/08/2018.,Transcript,,,,6XN201805082020,Newspaper Source,Crude Oil Prices Could Increase As U.S. Leaves Iran Nuclear Deal.,"MARY LOUISE KELLY: Well, if you want a visible sign of the uncertainty being caused by President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran deal, keep your eye on oil prices. They have been rising steadily for a bunch of reasons. The price of crude is up more than 15 percent this year, and Iran is a major oil producer. So this decision could roil energy markets around the world. NPR's Uri Berliner joins us now with more on that. Hey there, Uri.URI BERLINER: Hello, Mary Louise.KELLY: So do we know yet how this decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal may affect oil prices?BERLINER: Well, yesterday, the price of crude topped $70 a barrel. That was its highest level since 2014, and that was...KELLY: Yesterday - so meaning we didn't have this announcement yet, but everybody was anticipating...BERLINER: Yeah. Everybody was anticipating.KELLY: OK.BERLINER: That was when word was getting out. Today, actually, the prices have leveled off a little bit.KELLY: And then what about supply? I mean, once the Trump administration reinstates sanctions - the big takeaway from today - when sanctions kick in again on Iran, what might that do to oil supplies?BERLINER: Well, first, we don't know exactly how these sanctions are going to play out. But the U.S. could punish or threaten any country that ignores the U.S. sanction, and it doesn't - and doesn't curb its oil imports from Iran. It could do that diplomatically. It could do that by punishing the banks from those countries, cutting off some of their access to the U.S. financial system. But here's something to keep in mind. Oil supplies - they're fairly tight right now, and that's one of the factors that's been pushing up prices. You know, a few years ago, there was this huge glut of oil.KELLY: Right.BERLINER: All the big oil producers, including the U.S. - they were pumping a lot of crude. And the price of oil got dirt cheap. It fell to around $27 a barrel. Now that glut is being absorbed. There's more demand. Economies around the world are improving. And if sanctions take some of Iran's oil off global markets, we could see even tighter supplies and higher prices.KELLY: OK, so you're describing forces that were already in motion. We watch and wait and see how today's decision on the Iran deal may impact those forces - but back to this central question of Iran. I just described it as a major oil producer. How major, Uri? Where do they rank?BERLINER: Well, it's major. Iran was the world's fifth-largest oil producer last year, accounting for about 5 percent of total output. So it's significant, but it's not one of the oil giants. So are there - there are definitely factors beyond Iran that have been affecting the price of oil. You know, as I mentioned, there was this oil glut back in 2016. And in December of that year, Russia and Saudi Arabia and a number of other countries - they joined hands to limit production. They agreed to sell less oil into the global market. And surprisingly, that's worked 'cause those kinds of deals usually fall apart because of cheating.KELLY: Cheating meaning what?BERLINER: Cheating. The goal of these joint deals is to increase prices by limiting production. That takes time, and a lot of oil producing countries - they're pretty weak economically, so they need cash right away. So they go ahead. They keep producing and selling as much as they can. They cheat, and the deal falls apart. But this time, it worked largely because Saudi Arabia and Russia, two of the world's largest oil giants - they've stuck together and kept their promise to cut output.KELLY: All right, let me bring this right back home, right back to - I'm going to be driving home tonight trying to fill up my car at the gas station. Everything you're telling me suggests that the price that I will be paying to fill up my car - that we're all going to be paying to fill up our cars - that's going to sneak up, right?BERLINER: Yeah. You may not love it. The average price of a gallon of regular now is $2.81. That's up nearly 20 percent over the last year. In some parts of the country, especially on the West Coast, the price is well above $3. And gas prices normally get a bit higher in the summer when people start driving more - head off on vacation. So if gas prices go a lot higher, that could crimp consumer spending and have an impact on the broader economy.KELLY: All right, NPR business editor Uri Berliner - Uri, thank you.BERLINER: Thank you, Mary Louise.(SOUNDBITE OF KUTMASTA KURT SONG, ""LET ME TALK TO YOU"")Copyright of All Things Considered (NPR) is the property of National Public Radio, Inc.

[ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,bizwire.c86555936,Regional Business News,EPIC Announces Plans to Begin Interim Crude Oil Service on Its NGL Pipeline in Third Quarter of 2019," EPIC Midstream Holdings, LP (EPIC) today announced that it has obtained all necessary and required approvals for its subsidiary EPIC Crude Oil Pipeline, through a lease arrangement, to begin crude oil service on a portion of the EPIC NGL Pipeline owned by EPIC Y Grade Pipeline, LP, a subsidiary of EPIC Y Grade Services, LP, once construction of the pipeline is completed in the third quarter of 2019.   Because of high customer demand for crude oil transportation, EPIC made the decision to utilize the third and final phase of its EPIC NGL Pipeline from Crane, Texas to Corpus Christi, Texas for crude oil service while the EPIC Crude Oil Pipeline and EPIC NGL fractionator remain under construction. The EPIC NGL Pipeline will convert back to NGL Service at completion of the EPIC Crude Oil Pipeline by January 2020.   The portion of the NGL line being placed into crude service will originate in Crane with an additional injection point in Wink, TX and will have multiple terminal and refinery connections in Corpus Christi and Ingleside, Texas. The 24-inch NGL line will have a capacity of 400 thousand barrels of oil per day (MBbl/d) for its interim crude service. The construction of the final phase of the EPIC NGL Pipeline is progressing on time with three contractors working on the project over five spreads of the pipeline path.   Subject to FERC approval, EPIC Crude Oil Pipeline intends to offer this early service under a tariff to be filed with the FERC and pursuant to contracts executed with certain shippers following the close of open seasons for Committed Shipper services on the EPIC Crude Oil Pipeline. Included among these Committed Shippers are Noble Energy Inc., Apache Corporation, Diamondback Energy, and others.   In addition to offering early crude service to our shippers, EPIC has closed the second open season on the EPIC Crude Oil Pipeline.   Because of its commercial success, EPIC will upsize its pipeline from a 24-inch line to a 30-inch line, expanding its Permian Basin capacity to approximately 600 MBbl/d. With the installation of additional pumps and storage, EPIC can increase the 30-inch capacity to approximately 900 MBbl/d.   The EPIC Crude Oil Pipeline will run side-by-side with the EPIC NGL Pipeline with the crude line expected to be completed by January 2020. The 30-inch pipe has been ordered from two steel mills and is expected to start arriving in early 2019. The same construction crews from the EPIC NGL Pipeline will be utilized enabling significant synergies to the construction timeline. All major equipment and pumps are currently on hand.   “Given our recent commercial success and subsequent upsizing of the pipeline, we remain responsive to growing demand for crude oil transportation from the Permian Basin.” said Phillip Mezey, Chief Executive Officer of EPIC. “We are proud to be able to offer an interim solution for our customers, while we continue to build out the EPIC Crude Oil Pipeline to service this region.”   About EPIC Pipeline   EPIC was formed in 2017 to build, own, and operate midstream infrastructure in both the Permian and Eagle Ford Basins. EPIC’s first two projects, the EPIC Crude Oil Pipeline and the EPIC NGL Pipeline, will transport crude and NGL across Texas for delivery into the Corpus Christi market.

In addition, growing transportation industry across the world, rising number of automotives and aviation industry, use of growth in various end-use industry and increasing industrialization creates a demand for crude products.Furthermore, longer hauls and fewer triangulation options or backhaul routes to reduce ballasting are likely to present growth opportunities for industry participants.Increasing oil imports and stabilizing relations between OPEC and NON-OPEC nations are creating huge opportunities over the upcoming years. Moreover, ongoing low global oil prices and high supply from the organization of the petroleum exporting countries are anticipated to boost the demand for carriers demand over the years to come. Therefore, low bunker fuel prices are likely to spur increased earnings, leading to greater carrier application and demand across the globe.However, high logistics cost and decreasing oil imports that are beating into renewable solar power are likely to hamper the growth of the crude oil carrier market during the forecast period. Also, the high cost of capital required to acquire ships is also anticipated to create a negative impact on the market growth.Companies ProfiledKey Topics Covered1. Preface2. Executive Summary3.

The report predicts the global crude oil carriers market to grow with a CAGR of 3.6% over the forecast period of 2018-2024.  Increasing demand for crude oil and its by-products are the key factors driving the growth of the crude oil carriers market. In addition, growing transportation industry across the world, rising number of automotives and aviation industry, use of growth in various end-use industry and increasing industrialization creates a demand for crude products. Furthermore, longer hauls and fewer triangulation options or backhaul routes to reduce ballasting are likely to present growth opportunities for industry participants. Increasing oil imports and stabilizing relations between OPEC and NON-OPEC nations are creating huge opportunities over the upcoming years. Moreover, ongoing low global oil prices and high supply from the organization of the petroleum exporting countries are anticipated to boost the demand for carriers demand over the years to come. Therefore, low bunker fuel prices are likely to spur increased earnings, leading to greater carrier application and demand across the globe. However, high logistics cost and decreasing oil imports that are beating into renewable solar power are likely to hamper the growth of the crude oil carrier market during the forecast period. Also, the high cost of capital required to acquire ships is also anticipated to create a negative impact on the market growth.  Companies Profiled  China Shipping Tanker Co. Ltd.

[ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,bizwire.c85826140,Regional Business News,Tallgrass to Develop New Cushing to St. James Crude Oil Pipeline and Gulf Coast Liquids Export and Import Terminal," Tallgrass Energy, LP (NYSE: TGE) (“Tallgrass”) today announced plans to develop a new crude oil pipeline from Cushing, Okla., to the St. James, La., refining complex, as well as a separate new export-capable liquids terminal strategically located near the mouth of the Mississippi River.   The proposed Seahorse Pipeline (“Seahorse”) is expected to be 30 inches in diameter and approximately 700 miles long, with the capacity to transport up to 800,000 barrels of crude oil per day from Cushing to the Louisiana Gulf Coast. The pipeline will operate as a common grade batch system that, along with Tallgrass’ Pony Express Pipeline, will ensure domestic refiners and international markets have access to “clean” barrels from five different production basins.   The proposed new terminal, Plaquemines Liquids Terminal (“PLT”), is a joint development project with Drexel Hamilton Infrastructure Partners, LP and is being structured as a Public-Private Partnership (P3) in concert with the Plaquemines Port & Harbor Terminal District (PPHTD), a Louisiana state agency. The terminal is expected to be fully operational in 2Q 2020 and is permitted for up to 20 million barrels of storage. PLT will have the ability to fully load and unload Post-Panamax vessels (each with a capacity of about 1 million barrels) and barges on its multiple deep-water docks. Tallgrass anticipates building a separate offshore pipeline extension that would give PLT the added capability of loading Very Large Crude Carriers (“VLCC”) by 3Q 2021.   “The Seahorse Pipeline and Plaquemines Liquids Terminal projects build on our strategy to provide diversity of supply and greater market optionality to our customers,” said Tallgrass Energy President and CEO David G. Dehaemers Jr. “These projects provide highly desired take-away capacity from Cushing to the St. James refining complex, providing interconnectivity to more than 2.5 million barrels per day of refining capacity and access to international markets.”   “Our customers can rest comfortably knowing that their barrels will be transported on Seahorse in common grade batches from Pony Express direct-connected supply basins and Cushing sourced supplies, which will protect the integrity and help preserve the value of their product all the way to Seahorse’s St. James and export terminal destinations,” said Tallgrass Chief Operating Officer Bill Moler. “From there, our customers will be able to access international refining markets.”   Tallgrass expects to launch its initial open season for the Seahorse Pipeline on Aug. 15, 2018. The open season is expected to run for 45 days. Prospective shippers may review details of the open season after executing a confidentiality agreement obtained by contacting Tallgrass representatives Kyle Quackenbush, 303.763.3319; Andrew DiPaolo, 303.763.3329; or Dean Dick, 307.232.4430.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180613006109/en/ Ethylene & propylene production from Siluria Technologies' direct oxidative coupling of methane. (Source: IHS Markit 2018)   This analysis from Don Bari, vice president of chemical technology at IHS Markit, follows on an announcement made earlier today by Siluria Technologies, which has joined forces with Saudi Aramco Technologies: Siluria Technologies and Saudi Aramco Technologies Company join forces to maximize chemical production.  In the past decade or so, disruptive technology development and deployment have been dominant on a global basis in the petrochemical industry and largely driven by the extreme pricing dynamics of the energy industry, translating directly to fundamental petrochemical feedstocks; where such new technology has enabled deployers of capital and technology to use low-cost and locally abundant feedstocks.   One of the most significantly disruptive technologies or categories of technologies being developed, based on their sheer volume, is crude oil-to-chemicals. These projects, in effect, merge a refinery and petrochemical plant into one, and thus, go well beyond the state-of-the-art refinery petrochemical integration by the implementation of new/reconfiguring unit operations into a refinery.   The objective is to shift the product slate derived from a barrel of oil to a range of 40 percent to 80 percent chemical feedstocks and non-fuel products, up from the traditional range of 15 percent to 25 percent, in order to significantly increase the value of crude oil reserves. For example, Saudi Aramco Technologies Company publicly announced (in a joint news release with Siluria Technologies issued earlier today, Siluria Technologies and Saudi Aramco Technologies Company join forces to maximize chemical production): “Maximizing the output of high-value chemicals products from our future crude-oil processing projects is one of the key objectives in our downstream technology strategy, said Ahmad Al Khowaiter, chief technology officer of Saudi Aramco.”   The Siluria Technologies process, which produces olefins directly from natural gas through oxidative coupling (chemistry) of methane (OCM), is expected to further allow Saudi Aramco’s future crude oil-to-chemicals facilities to create more value by converting the very low-value off-gases (largely methane) into higher-value olefins products, which improves carbon efficiency and increases the volume of the barrel of oil directed to valuable fundamental petrochemicals.   Competitive and sustainable advantages of such a fully integrated crude oil-to-chemical facility:  Upgrades a lower-value stream into a higher-value product through greater operational efficiency and optimization of assets. Greater capital efficiency--leverages a well-integrated upstream (refinery) with the downstream (chemicals) operations to increase efficiency of deployed capital (maximum investment-per-ton of production capacity) through scale; and decreases operating costs through carbon efficiency and low fixed operating costs. (In a Reuters News article published Jan. 18, 2018, Aramco chief technology officer Ahmad Al-Khowaiter said the process called thermal crude-to-chemicals technology “would cut capital costs by 30 percent compared to conventional refining.”). Sustainability gains through the reduction in the overall carbon footprint of a facility due to integration and optimization of assets, which become more efficient.  The “disruption” to conventional petrochemical producers would likely be the loss of market position due to COTC’s immense petrochemical volume. For example:  The global demand for ethylene and propylene are 160 million metric tons (MMT) and 111 MMT per year, respectively, and at approximately 4 percent annual growth rate, the required global annual capacity additions would be 6.4 MMT and 4.4 MMT of ethylene and propylene, respectively. These volumes could nearly be supplied from two large-scale 200,000 barrel-per-day COTC complexes (see analysis below and note that multiple FCCs, cracking furnaces and cracked gas compressor/separation trains would be required); instead of four conventional state-of-the-art naphtha-cracking light olefins plants. If multiple COTC facilities are eventually built, the export dynamics would, over time, change significantly and put pressure on olefin and feedstock-related derivative exports from the U.S. According to our IHS Markit estimates, U.S. exports of these olefin and feedstock-related derivatives will reach approximately 14 MMT by 2020.  Siluria Technologies: Addressing sustainability through carbon efficiency—A new operational metric?   Siluria Technologies’ oxidative coupling of methane to ethylene (and propylene) process converts methane to olefins in the presence of a catalyst in an oxygen-rich environment. The catalyst reaction “diverts” roughly half of the carbon to the undesirable co-products of carbon monoxide (CO) or carbon dioxide (CO2).In this highly exothermic (heat generating) reaction. Siluria exploits this exotherm by injecting ethane or propane into a second reaction chamber, where the light alkane is thermally cracked to the olefin.   Moreover, to enhance the overall carbon efficiency of the process, a catalytic methanation step is embodied in Siluria’s process. This reaction converts all generated CO and a portion of the CO2 oxidative coupling reaction co-product back to methane by using the hydrogen generated in both the OCM and the ethane/propane-cracking reaction in the post-OCM section of the reactor.   In fact, the Siluria process design philosophy is all about less total carbon (methane) consumed per unit of light olefins produced, because the process is “indifferent” to methane as a feedstock, or as energy (process utility). Therefore, one would expect that a design philosophy that equates British thermal units (BTU) of energy savings to a reactor-conversion-per-pass percent increase should drive that most optimum overall process design.   Significant carbon reduction through process design   The Siluria OCM process also delivers significant reduction in carbon emissions over traditional ethylene production processes. IHS Markit evaluation of total carbon dioxide emissions to the production of ethylene by various feedstock types shows that the Siluria technology is expected to be a net-negative CO2 producer per ton of ethylene/olefins produced because of the heat generation for the OCM exotherm, and methane production (partly) from CO2 is considered in our methodology as an offset to CO2 emissions. IHS Markit estimates that the Siluria Technologies OCM process generates negative 1 ton of carbon dioxide emissions equivalents per ton of ethylene produced as compared to the more conventional naphtha-cracking process for converting crude to olefins, which is estimated at greater than 1.4 tons of CO2 produced per ton of ethylene produced. This is a significant improvement in carbon emission reduction, while at the same time capturing greater value from the molecules.   How can Siluria Technologies add to the impact of crude oil-to-chemicals mega complexes?   Independent and detailed technical analysis by IHS Markit of a Saudi Aramco-type COTC approach (as described in Saudi Aramco’s patent literature) projects that crude oil feedstock will be converted to chemicals at a higher intensity than conventional processes, increasing the yields of crude oil feedstocks converted to chemicals to 72 percent. (Note that a January 18, 2018 Saudi Aramco announcement by Reuters states that it expects, with its developing COTC technology, “70 percent to 80 percent of the crude intake will be converted into chemicals….”).   With the recent cooperation announcement by Siluria Technologies and Saudi Aramco Technologies Company to work together in the COTC process to maximize the production of chemicals from a barrel of oil, IHS Markit speculates that if the methane off-gas and a portion of the ethane in a hydrocracked Arab Light crude oil feedstock were to be fed to the Siluria OCM technology, then a net increase of 300 thousand metric tons (TMT) to 350 TMT of ethylene and 200 TMT to 250 TMT per-year of propylene, would be generated (based on 10 million metric tons (MMT) per year (200,000 barrels per day) of crude feed). With methane valued at U.S. $1.25 per MMBTU in the Middle East, the Siluria OCM technology appears to be an attractive approach to enhance the value of a barrel of oil.   Direct oxidative coupling of methane to ethylene has been an elusive goal   The oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to ethylene has attracted significant attention since its discovery in the early 1980’s. Compelling efforts to produce ethylene directly from natural gas have been made, yet no OCM process has been commissioned at commercial scale.   The two major companies that tried to commercialize OCM, ARCO and Union Carbide, did extensive catalyst screening studies in the 1980’s and early 1990’s. ARCO reviewed several transition metal oxides as oxidative coupling catalysts. Manganese oxide catalysts on silica support where found to be the most attractive for methane conversion to ethylene. However, high-product yields required operating temperatures above 800°C. Higher operating temperatures led to methyl radicals forming higher-carbon number products, and undesirable products (CO, CO2, and coke) formed.   A similar conclusion was reached by Union Carbide. The Union Carbide research showed that the development of more active (and selective) catalysts potentially operating in the 400°C to 600°C range might permit industrial operation. Although those catalysts showed promising yield and selectivities, they were significantly hampered by long-term catalyst stability issues, largely due to the required high-reactor inlet temperatures.   Siluria has developed and scaled-up a proprietary commercial, low-temperature OCM catalyst that can operate adiabatically with fewer stages at several hundred degrees °C lower inlet temperatures, and at higher pressures. This catalyst produces a favorable yield and has a standard lifetime for a commercialized process; and it has a relatively high-space velocity. According to U.S. provisional patent applications, Siluria’s proprietary catalyst is based upon mixed-metal oxide nanowires.   The heart of Siluria’s process technology is a two-stage adiabatic reactor. Within the reactor, heat recovery is a significant technology feature, where the exothermic heat from OCM is used to thermally crack the by-product and fresh ethane and propane to ethylene and or propylene. As previously mentioned, a methanation step is employed to convert co-product CO, CO2 and H2 back to methane, and to enhance overall carbon and energy efficiency of the process.   To enhance the overall carbon efficiency of the process, a catalytic methanation step is included in Siluria’s process. This reaction converts all generated CO, and a portion of the CO2 OCM, back to methane by using the hydrogen generated in both the OCM and ethane-propane cracking-reaction sections of the post-OCM section of the reactor.   The product gas from the OCM reactor moves downstream to the generally conventional olefins cracking separation, recovery and fractionation steps. However, Siluria has developed proprietary separation and recovery technology, including optimizing system hydraulics, thermodynamics (pressures and temperatures) and heat integration, to minimize energy consumption.   This is especially necessary given that the methane-per-pass-conversion is relatively low due to the thermodynamic limitations of the OCM adiabatic-reaction design. The low methane-conversion-per-pass means that a large amount of methane must be recompressed and cryogenically cooled at great capital and energy expense, to recover the olefin products.   In short, the intersection of a global hydrocarbon resource powerhouse such as Saudi Aramco, with Siluria Technologies, a small, but innovative, process-technology company, is expected to yield significant returns for both entities, but also drive the industry forward in process improvements, greater carbon efficiency, capital efficiency and value creation. While these technologies are capitally intensive, the commercial application of these two revolutionary technologies not only enables greater carbon efficiency, flexibility and value to the petrochemical producers, but also a significant route to greater carbon emission reduction, which has an untold value to chemical producers and to the sustainability of the industry. This sustainability value will likely only continue to increase as more consumers, investors and regulators seek greater environmental stewardship from petrochemical producers.

0,"Spokesman-Review, The (Spokane, WA). 10/15/2018.",Article,,,,2W61143997063,Newspaper Source,Advisory Vote 19 involves a tax on crude oil,"Jim Camden     Oct. 15--In November, Washington voters will have the chance to show their support or opposition to a tax on oil brought to state refineries by pipelines.     The tax was imposed by the Legislature earlier this year. Like its name suggests, Advisory Vote 19 isn't binding on the Legislature, which typically ignores the results of these measures whether they come down on the side of ""repeal"" or ""maintain.""     In the 2018 session, the Legislature extended the state's oil spill administration tax and its oil spill response tax, both of which are levied on crude oil brought to refineries by ships or barges. The two taxes, which together total 5 cents on a 42-gallon barrel, were extended to crude coming in by pipeline.     Money from the spill administration tax is used to cover prevention, response and restoration programs, and the response tax is set aside for cleanup costs that exceed $50,000. With the extra money -- estimated at about $1.3 million per year -- the Department of Ecology is required to update contingency plans for spills that involve oils with diluted bitumen, a heavy, viscous form of petroleum which can sink in water. The department will also review operations that handle those oils.     The department will also be required to conduct drills to practice handling spills; set up an annual forum with Canadian agencies on common issues involving the Salish Sea, the term for the inland waterway that includes Puget Sound and areas on the coast of British Columbia; and produce an annual report on marine traffic in the Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca.     The bill extending the tax passed both chambers with bipartisan support in the final week of the session.     Under state law, an increase in taxes must be placed on the general election ballot as an advisory vote, but the law does not bind lawmakers to act on the results of that vote in the next session. No previous advisory vote has resulted in the Legislature changing a tax.     ___

Global crude oil prices have increased more than $15 per barrel since early this year, said Cholanat Yanaranop, president of the chemicals business at SCG.     The fuel factor has narrowed spread prices against naphtha by $100 per tonne from the beginning of this year to $600 per tonne for polypropylene (PP) and to $700 per tonne for high-density polyethylene (HDPE).     ""As a result of the narrow spread, we have already increased our sale prices of petrochemical products to reflect the actual costs,"" Mr Cholanat said. Overall global orders of plastic granules are falling because of the global trade war, led by the US and China, he said.     ""But we hope increasing global crude oil prices will not affect on our sales revenue beyond what we can handle because we are focusing on high value-added [HVA] products and services, instead of commodity products,"" said Mr Cholanat.     HVA revenue represents 38% of overall SCG sales and SCG expects to increase this contribution by 1-2% annually.     HVA revenue in the first six months stood at 91.1 billion baht, up by 6% from the same period last year.     For HVA, SCG signed an R&D agreement to develop an innovative dental product with the Faculty of Dentistry, Mahidol University, and Dental Council of Thailand, with the aim of promoting innovation and replacing imports, lowering expenses by 20-30%.     The agreement will also provide greater public access to medical care as the products will be listed as Thai innovation under the Finance Ministry.     The chemicals segment posted revenue of 110 billion baht during January to June, up 5.8% from the same period last year.     SCG's chemicals segment is one of the largest integrated petrochemical companies in Asia, manufacturing and supplying a full range of petrochemical products, from upstream monomers to downstream polymers including PE, PP, polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene.     In a separate development, Mr Cholanat said SCG has drawn interest from many state agencies and corporate companies for the pilot floating solar farm project in Rayong province.     ""The floating solar farm is undergoing a feasibility study as SCG expects to upgrade this project for commercial purposes in the near future as Thailand has the opportunity and efficiency to develop a solar energy system along with plenty of human-made water resources such as dams and reservoirs,"" Mr Cholanat said.     SCG expects Thailand can generate 6% of total power from the floating solar farms at 3,000 megawatts.     ___     (c)2018 the Bangkok Post (Bangkok, Thailand)     Visit the Bangkok Post (Bangkok, Thailand) at www.bangkokpost.com     Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.Copyright of Bangkok Post (Thailand) is the property of Bangkok Post (Thailand).

Chairwoman Ghayapad Tantipipatpong said when the crude price rose to $75 a barrel it also raised the price of oil-related exports, and oil-producing countries had stronger purchasing power.     That was why the council had predicted the total value of exports would rise by 9% this year, she said.     ""However, the oil price will be beneficial to exports only as long as the price does not exceed $80 per barrel. If it is higher, production and transport costs will rise at once,"" Ms Ghayapad said. The shippers council was closely monitoring the price.     She also believed the trade tariffs dispute between China and the United States would have a positive impact on Thai exports of products that could replace Chinese products in the US market. She cited rice, natural rubber, seafood, vegetables and fruit.     Southeast Asian nations like Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam could also welcome large-scale manufacturers who chose to move their bases to avoid the impact of the Sino-US dispute, Ms Ghayapad said.     ___

[ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,bizwire.c84207856,Regional Business News,Flinders University Scientists Develop New Environmental Polymer Which Quickly and Effectively Soaks up Crude Oil," On the eve of the anniversary of the US Deepwater Horizon disaster, polluted beaches, oily water, dead birds and marine life destruction caused by crude oil spills could be a thing of the past thanks to pioneering research led by Flinders University.   In an exciting, sustainable answer to clean up oil spill destruction, scientists have developed a new polymer – itself made from by-products – which quickly and effectively soaks up crude oil.   In an environmental win-win, the polymer made from waste cooking oil and sulphur (a by-product of the petroleum industry) absorbs crude oil and diesel spills.   Better still, because this highly buoyant polymer acts like a sponge to suck spills from sea water, the polymer can be squeezed to recover the oil and then reused.   Award-winning scientist Dr Justin Chalker, Senior Lecturer in Synthetic Chemistry at Flinders University in Adelaide, South Australia, is leading an international research team responsible for the discovery.   “This is an entirely new and environmentally beneficial application for polymers made from sulphur,” says Dr Chalker. “This application can consume excess waste sulfur that is stockpiled around the globe and may help mitigate the perennial problem of oil spills in aquatic environments.”   Oil spills are a major global issue, with the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation (ITOPF) reporting about 7000 tonnes of crude oil spilling from tankers into oceans in 2017 alone.   The international team of researchers point to the effects of recent large-scale spillage catastrophes as a potent reason driving their research – in particular, the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig on 20 April 2010 and subsequent release of approximately 4.9 million barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico.   A recent large oil spill off Borneo has prompted Indonesian authorities to declare a State of Emergency.   Hundreds of smaller spills of diesel fuel and other petroleum products affect developing countries in Africa, Asia and South America.   The new material is cost effective and sustainable, helping developing countries where smaller, localised spills threaten groundwater, drinking water and important food staples such as fish.   “This is a new class of oil sorbents that is low-cost, scalable, and enables the efficient removal and recovery of oil from water,” says Dr Chalker.   The research is published in the new paper, Sustainable Polysulfides for Oil Spill Remediation: Repurposing Industrial Waste for Environmental Benefit, published in Advanced Sustainable Systems (Wiley) DOI: 10.1002/adsu.201800024 by Flinders and other researchers – Justin Chalker, Max Worthington, Cameron Shearer, Louisa Esdaile, Jonathan Campbell, Christopher Gibson, Stephanie Legg, Yanting Yin, Nicholas Lundquist, Jason Gascooke, Inês Albuquerque (Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Lisbon), Joseph Shapter (Flinders and University of Queensland), Gunther Andersson, David Lewis and Gonçalo Bernardes (Cambridge University and IMM, Portugal).

The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market.One trend in the market is supercritical carbon dioxide in shale oil fracking. Hydraulic fracturing or fracking process uses gallons of water and chemicals for opening the pores of the rock formation. However, non-aqueous fracking fluids such as supercritical carbon dioxide have been increasingly adopted as a replacement of water in the fracking process.According to the report, one driver in the market is increasing consumption of oil and natural gas. With the rising industrialization and urbanization, the consumption of oil and gas has increased considerably over the last few years. According to this research report on the shale oil market, this increased consumption of crude oil and gas across different end-user segments will be one of the key factors fueling the market's growth during the next few years.Further, the report states that one challenge in the market is uncertainties associated with low crude oil prices. The oil and gas industry depend vastly on the commodity prices. Any fluctuation in the crude oil prices defines the performance of the majority of the upstream sector companies.Key vendorsKey Topics Covered:PART 01: EXECUTIVE SUMMARYPART 02: SCOPE OF THE REPORTPART 03: RESEARCH METHODOLOGYPART 04: MARKET LANDSCAPEPART 05: MARKET SIZING 2017-2022PART 06: FIVE FORCES ANALYSISPART 07: CUSTOMER LANDSCAPEPART 08: MARKET SEGMENTATION BY END-USERPART 09: REGIONAL LANDSCAPEPART 10: DECISION FRAMEWORKPART 11: DRIVERS AND CHALLENGESPART 12: MARKET TRENDSPART 13: VENDOR LANDSCAPEPART 14: VENDOR ANALYSISFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/36h4b6/global_shale_oil?w=3CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.com,Laura Wood,Senior Manager.press@researchandmarkets.comRelated Topics: Oil (https://www.researchandmarkets.com/categories.asp?cat_id=46&campaign_id=36h4b6)((Comments on this story may be sent to info@m2.com))(C)2018 M2 COMMUNICATIONS http://www.m2.comCopyright of M2PressWIRE is the property of M2PressWIRE.

Advances in drilling technology, floating production, dynamic positioning equipment, and drilling units have made deepwater exploration a viable option. The exhaustion of some of the shallow offshore resources has pushed vendors to explore and produce oil and gas from deepwater and ultra-deepwater (at depths of 1,500 meters or more) resources.   According to a senior analyst at Technavio for specialty chemicals research, “The increasing oil exploration in deepwater and ultra-deepwater is expected to drive the demand for crude oil flow improvers. Low temperatures and high pressure on the offshore locations can lead to the precipitation of waxes, hydrates, and asphaltenes. Crude oil flow improvers enhance the flow assurance of crude oil and help in increasing the production capacity.”  Looking for more information on this market?

Market trend: refracturing of old crude oil wells   Refracturing of shale wells is a topical issue as operators can use latest technologies on old wells, thereby increasing the production without incurring costs on new wells. The functions of old or underperforming wells are stopped, and hydraulic simulation is applied for completion. The application of hydraulic simulation in horizontal shale wells is in the initial phase. In 2015, the number of horizontal wells re-fracked in the US was almost less than 1% of the total number of horizontal wells. Refracturing can lead to an increase in the demand for crude oil flow improvers during the forecast period. In 2016 there were over 50,000 existing wells in the US, which can also be fracked.   Market challenge: stringent regulations and policies   The constant push from regulatory authorities such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) is likely to limit onshore and offshore activities, thereby hampering the growth of the global COFI market. The EPA amended new regulations in the Oil and Gas Extraction Effluent Guidelines and Standards (40 CFR Part 435) in 2016. The regulation contains strict guidelines and policies for wastewater discharges from production, field exploration, drilling, production, well treatment, and well completion activities.

The global crude oil market is growing due to an increase in consumption of primarily crude oil products such as gasoline and diesel. This is mainly due to high economic growth in countries such as India, China, and the US leading to an increase in sales of vehicles in these countries. Moreover, the switch to alternative fuels such as natural gas and biofuels from crude oil by buyers due to growing concerns regarding pollution caused by burning of crude oil products is resulting in a minimal growth in the overall demand for crude oil.   Further, the report states that major a challenge experienced by the buyers is the high cost of lighter and sweeter crude oil.   The report provides actionable insights to improve source-to-contract cycle performance in the Global Crude Oil Market. It helps sourcing professionals formulate better category strategies, enhance savings, understand supplier and market challenges, and implement sourcing best practices.

[ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,wapo.2128eee2-bcfc-11e8-8792-78719177250f,Newspaper Source,N.D. Senate candidates feud over who gets credit for lifting crude oil export ban,"U.S. petroleum producers have been allowed to sell their product unencumbered overseas, thanks to a compromise between Democrats and Republicans in 2015.Now three years later, the two Senate candidates vying to represent a major oil-producing state are both trading swipes over the lifting of that long-standing ban on the export of crude oil. With recent polling showing the North Dakota Senate race will be tight, there's been a heated back-and-forth between Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) over who deserves credit for lifting the ban. Heitkamp is among the most vulnerable Senate Democrats up for reelection, and the Cook Political Report characterizes the race as a toss-up. It started this week when Cramer released a television ad touting the role he played in repealing the oil-export restrictions imposed in the 1970s following the oil embargo from Middle Eastern nations and the subsequent spike in gasoline prices in the United States.Since the boom in hydraulic fracturing nationwide over the past decade, the United States has not had enough refineries to process all the sweet shale oil extracted in recent years in North Dakota. So officials there and in other oil-producing states pushed for Congress to get rid of the oil-export ban so that crude could be sold and refined abroad.""I helped lead the repeal of the oil export ban,"" Cramer says in his 30-second spot. ""Now, foreign markets are open so that North Dakota can deliver energy to the world.""Lifting the ban, however, is an accomplishment for which many lawmakers in both parties give Heitkamp credit. The commercial drew a quick rebuke from Heitkamp's campaign, which put out a news release claiming Cramer took ""credit for something he literally never did - that is, lead on lifting the crude oil export ban.""In an interview with The Washington Post, Heitkamp said she considers repealing the ban a signature achievement, one that she has featured in her own ads.""It was kind of classic because all along Congressman Cramer, over and over and over again, claims to have done things that the facts don't support,"" said Heitkamp, who began publicly pushing for removing the ban in the summer of 2014, with a speech in Bismarck, N.D., and in an appearance on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone in Washington who worked on this issue who would say that he helped lead any of it,"" she added.Cramer had co-sponsored pieces of legislation undoing the ban, beginning in late 2014. But Heitkamp's team points out that he was eventually one of 137 House members to sign his name to the bill.In a separate interview, Cramer countered that no single lawmaker deserves all the credit for the passage of a law. He notes that only the House, and not the Senate, ever passed a stand-alone bill lifting the ban.""It's just peculiar to me that she's got this insecurity about my role in something that was so clearly my role,"" Cramer said, ""almost as though I should be punished because there are 100 people smart enough in the House of Representatives to co-sponsor a bill.""Throughout 2015, Cramer penned op-eds and gave speeches on the House floor in favor of repealing the oil-export ban. At the time, his office touted his role in persuading conservative Blue Dog Democrats in the House to support the measure.But at the same time that year, Heitkamp was widely credited by her colleagues for helping persuade other members of the Democratic caucus, leery about increasing the amount of oil the nation takes out of the ground given its contributions to climate change, to go along with it.Without Heitkamp, ""I don't know that it would have happened,"" said Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.) in 2015, according to Bloomberg Government. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) added that Heitkamp was ""just dogged in her efforts to help educate her party."" Staff members for Heitkamp and Murkowski began discussing lifting the ban shortly after the 2014 midterm election. The next year, Reps. Barton and Henry Cuellar (D-Tex.) approached Heitkamp about their efforts in the House to lift the ban. She assured them ""that she was going to help and going to lead on the Senate side,"" according to Cuellar spokeswoman Olya Voytovich.The crux of the compromise ultimately made between Democrats and Republicans, which came as a part of an end-of-year spending package in 2015, was a trade off between oil and renewable energy interests. In exchange for lifting the oil-export ban, the GOP-controlled Congress temporarily extended several much-sought tax breaks for individuals and companies that build and run wind, solar and other alternative energy generation facilities.With wind turbines sprouting up across North Dakota's gusty plains, both Heitkamp and Cramer characterized the compromise as a victory for the state.But even on that issue, they traded barbs. Heitkamp suggested her opponent's record of support for the state's wind energy industry was insufficient because he has pushed for an end to the wind subsidies that helped propel it.""Congressman Cramer is not known as somebody who has been particularly helpful on renewable energy,"" she said.In response, Cramer called lifting the ban and extending the credits ""a win and a win"" for the state. ""What I liked about the renewable credits extension was that there's a permanent end to them, and a phase out that was negotiated with the industry itself,"" Cramer said. ""But for that, it would have been a difficult one to swallow.""dino.grandoni@washpost.com Source: Washington Post, The, 09/21/2018Item: wapo.2128eee2-bcfc-11e8-8792-78719177250f"

Aug 6 (Interfax-Kazakhstan) â€“ The tumble in the tenge to 350 tenge / $ 1, is viewed by analysts polled by the Interfax-Kazakhstan agency as the end of the tenge weakening phase with expectation of strengthening in September-October.Centras Securities CEO Talgat Kamarov believes that the main reason behind the tenge fall is the declining commodities prices and an increased seasonal demand for cash dollars for outbound tourism.""The strengthening of the dollar is influenced by the mass exit of non-resident investors from the market of National Bankâ€™s securities due to higher rates in the US and a lower base rate in Kazakhstan. With a looming trade war between the US and China and a dwindling profit from carry trade, foreign investors turn away from the currencies of developing countries, which includes Kazakhstan, "" Kamarov said.Zhannur Ashigali, a deputy director of research at the Analytical Credit Rating Agency, expects a rebound in tenge in September-October.He cited stabilization of consumersâ€™ income this year that led to a raise in the demand for external products and services including tourism and dollar strengthening on back of the heightened interest in the US assets.""Even though the inflation in Kazakhstan has slowed down, it still remains relatively high as compared with many trading partner countries, which accumulates the potential for depreciation of the national currency over time, ""Ashigali said.Director of Kazkommerts Securities forecast department Nurlan Ashinov explains a plunge in tenge's value with speculations, since â€œKazakhstanâ€™s economy is much more robust than one or two years ago.â€""Provided that the US does not impose additional sanctions on the Russian Federation, and the growth of the world economy does not stall suddenly, the weakening of the tenge against the dollar should stop at 340 tenge in the fall,"" Ashinov said.Ashinov also cites an increased capital outflow from emerging markets due to higher rates in developed countries.Over the past month, the tenge rate against the US dollar weakened by 2.4%, since the beginning of this year by 5.2%.

The high level commercial terms comprise of two parts. Firstly, a tolling fee for the stabilisation of liquid condensate which will be US$8 per barrel and secondly the purchasing of raw gas from Ural Oil & Gas at a price to be agreed at the point of delivery.Kai-Uwe Kessel, CEO of Nostrum Oil & Gas, commented: 'This agreement marks a significant step for Nostrum in demonstrating the value of its infrastructure. Whilst the Company's focus remains stabilising and ramping up production from the Chinarevskoye field, this agreement provides the potential for a secure revenue stream in the next three to five years. Nostrum's ability to fully monetise the hydrocarbons in the Chinarevskoye field is not restricted as we will have 4.2bcm of annual processing capacity available through GTU [gas treatment units] 1, 2 and 3. It further reinforces the potential of Nostrum's infrastructure and its ability to carry out value accretive deals in the region. This is the second such deal that illustrates the value of the gas treatment facility following the acquisition of the Trident licences in 2013 for US$16 million, which now have 121 million boe 2P reserves booked in them. We see an ability to further grow our access to resources in the region as a result of the investments we have made in our infrastructure.'Ural Oil & Gas specialize in oil exploration in the Fedorovsky field in the West Kazakhstan region. In 2008, during the testing of the Rozhkovskaya U-10 exploration well, an oil, gas and gas condensate field was discovered on the block. It was reported in 2017 that the Rozhkovskoye field has 196 million boe put on the books as category 2P reserves. A study prepared by Wood Mackenzie says that Ural Oil & Gas already drilled and completed eight wells at the Rozhkovskoye field located 20 km away from the Chinarevskoye field.The shareholders of Ural Oil & Gas are the national company KazMunayGas (50%), Sinopec (27.5%) and MOL Group (22.5%).Nostrum Oil & Gas LP is the parent company of Kazakhstan-based Zhaikmunai LLP.Zhaikmunai LLP is an independent oil and gas enterprise currently engaging in the exploration, production and sale of crude oil and gas condensate in northwestern Kazakhstan.

With successful completion of drilling operations at well 40 in the northern part of the Chinarevskoye exploration license area we confirmed the discovery made in well 724 at the end of last year in the upper Devonian formation. Well 40 has been tested with flow rates exceeding 1,500 boe per day and is currently undergoing long term testing and detailed investigations to determine reserves and production capabilities. This is a very significant result as it can potentially open up a new area in the Chinarevskoye field that is rich in hydrocarbons and of material scale. This is one of our highest yielding condensate wells in the fieldâ€™s history. We will now deepen another old well, 52, in order to try to test the productivity of the same reservoir further to the east. We are focused on low cost ways to increase near term production and open up the potential of the northern area of our field. I am pleased that we have now brought well 201 on line. This is producing from the Biski reservoir in the east where we have recently encountered issues with water inflow to some wells.

This shipment was delivered to Spain and represents a new milestone in Russian natural gas supplies to the country, to which pipeline gas is not shipped from Russia, Gyetvay said.He said the decrease in purchases in the second quarter compared to the first was due partly to maintenance on Yamal LNG's first train in May, but mainly to the start of LNG sales under long-term contracts.Due to the accelerated launch of the plant's first train, Novatek sold LNG on both the spot market and under long-term contracts in the second quarter, Gyetvay said. In the first quarter of 2018 it only sold on the spot market.He said this will continue due to the accelerated launch of the second and third trains, since Novatek will buy the LNG that will be produced due to the accelerated launch from Yamal LNG according to its stake, and will continue purchases under long-term contracts in amounts that are smaller than Novatek's stake in the project (14% by Interfax estimates).Yamal LNG's customers under long-term contracts are Total Gas & Power (4 million tonnes), Spain's Gas Natural Fenosa (2.5 million tonnes), China's CNPC (3 million tonnes), Gazprom Marketing & Trading (up to 2.9 million tonnes) and Novatek Gas & Power (2.4 million tonnes).

The project, the cost of which is estimated at $ 7 billion, is comparable to the giant Kashagan one in terms of complexity and investment level. At the same time, it is possible to accelerate its implementation thanks to the already accumulated experience on the shelf. Rashid ZHAKSYLYKOV, Chairman of the Presidium of Kazakhstanâ€™s Union of Oilfield Services Companies, talked about the prospects for the most long-awaited projects in the countryâ€™s oil and gas sector and in the development of the domestic oilfield service companies in an interview with Interfax-Kazakhstan.- Recently it became known that a project to maintain the oil plateau rate will be implemented at the Karachaganak field. What are the chances for the domestic oilfield service companies to participate in this project? Will they also be able to participate in the construction of the fourth oil refinery and the Saryarka gas pipeline?- All the projects you mentioned are interesting, but so far they exist in the form of a concept. To date, Tengizchevroil consortiumâ€™s (TCO) the [Tengiz expansion project] has got a real start â€“ itâ€™s a third generation plant. All tenders have been held and general contractors selected. Therefore, the Union is actively working in this direction. And the amount is impressive, all the projects enumerated by you will not dwarf even one third of the cost of the Tengiz expansion. There is $38 billion, in addition, it's new qualified personnel, a new kind of business activity, new technologies. Therefore, today the domestic business is more involved in real mode, in the TCO real project.As for the Kashagan expansion, it is under way. They want to increase production to 450,000 [barrels] a day. This level is feasible, and there will be no much money to be poured in there because the reserve was already calculated when the facility was commissioned. Maybe there will be small details, but nothing grandiose is expected. The only thing that we look forward to NCOC the [Kashagan operator] is the development of the Kalamkas field. This will be a field identical to Kashagan, and there the investment package will be very large. We expect probably around $ 7 billion if Kalamkas is put into service.- $ 7 billion - is this an investment in the development of the Kalamkas-Sea field?- Yes, the investment in the project implementation. As if the concept has already been approved by investors, the head of state is interested and the support of the Kazakh side has been officially announced. Now the work is ongoing at the level of lawyers and financiers.As for the Astana gas supply distribution, I do not think that Kazakh business will be able to earn from this and develop. Yes, itâ€™s possible to support, but many companies will not be involved there. In general, we have so few companies that can withstand competition in the gas pipeline construction, there must be unique welding, this is very dangerous business, so there will be a strict selection. Companies [service ones], which are in the market are most unlikely to pass through. Unequivocally we will resort to the services of foreign companies, but in this project, of course, we will ""run in"" our domestic companies as well.- Can one expect that NCOC will start developing the Kalamkas-Sea field in the next few years?- Yes. In terms of complexity and scope of work, the project is comparable to Kashagan. The head of state asked that it not be delayed. Our country is tasked with raising production to 125 million tonnes of oil per year by 2024. With what reserves can we do this? We are hoping for the Tengiz expansion, we are hoping for Kalamkas too. I do not see other options yet. You know perfectly well that there is a decline in production in the other regions like Kyzylorda, Aktobe, Mangystau. Investors do not want to invest money in the development because all strata are worn out but geologists are lagging behind. Over these years in pursuit of the extensions of existing oil fields we forgot about geology.We have probably overcome the level of complexity because we built Kashagan and have huge experience. How unique was Kashagan? Say, before the Kazakh companies were always involved in onshore projects. From the Caspian Sea to Karabatan we went through three stages: water, marshland and shore. Wherever onshore we had experience, but there was no expereince with offshore and swamps. You know the history of Kashagan, which began 10 years later than it was stated. If Kalamkas is started, then there the speed of the facility commissioning will be rapid. First, we know the companies which can do this, and Kashagan's investors already have diplomatic and friendly relations and can coordinate quickly. That is currently the NCOC team has been formed up.- How successfully are local oilfield service companies working at Kashagan and what are their prospects for Kalamkas? Can they get complex large-scale work?- In the past year the government has been taking great care of and has been protecting domestic business. Now, if you want to participate in large tenders - over $30 million then you must mandatorily have a joint venture with a Kazakh company.This is the PSA requirement [PSA LLP, acts as an authorized body in the production sharing agreements for the North Caspian and Karachaganak projects], a supervisory body established by the Energy Ministry. This applies specifically to NCOC and KPO (Karachaganak Petroleum Operating). That is, tenders from these companies worth more than $ 30 million cannot be awarded without consent from PSA. It has the right to veto and not to approve of a tender. And practice proves we feel it currently.- Does this not contradict the norms of the Product Sharing Agreement (PSA)?- It seems to me that the interest of Kazakhstan rather than the investor will be more and more taken into account every year. Global practice proves this. Say, the Saudis. Initially, [they] gave 95% to investors with the remaining 5% with the Saudis. Now, on the contrary, 95% remains with them and only 5% with investors. Norway has gone through this as well. There is nothing terrible in this, and we must overcome. You can imagine, the TCO project is under preparation - after the plant construction it is necessary to landscape its territory, plant trees, build access roads, fences. They do not want to give even this type of work to Kazakh business; we are fighting even for this segment. Designs are carried out abroad. But we can plant trees, build roads and fences.- Kashagan, you mentioned, plans to expand production to 450,000 barrels a day. Now they are slightly behind schedule or adjusting it. For the time being they have not reached a planned 370,000 barrels a day and planning to do so already in 2019...- Absolutely not, not lagging, even ahead of schedule. They are on schedule, you know, why investors currently, it seems to me, are a little bit lagging behind with the extension. So you want to ask a question, why do not they start this project? Investors are awaiting the outcome. They have invested more than $50 billion, we all know quite well, that with bank remuneration this went up as much as $ 80 billion. Now they are awaiting the return on investment. Once they feel a convincing return, they will begin to release money for the expansion. Without consent from the investors, they the [consortium NCOC] cannot. This does not depend on the NCOC team but on the investors who invested in the project. In addition, I do not think that the investors have only one project - Kashagan. Probably, they have a lot of projects, but Kalamkas is of great interest to them. Therefore, probably this is a tactic or strategy, as soon as they get ready to invest that very day the project will start. We have just wait and see.- Will there be new discoveries in small and medium-sized areas so that junior companies could earn money?- You remember, in early 2017 the head of state started his foreign visits with the UK. He was there and signed, unless I am mistaken, contracts of intent with more than 15 European exploration companies so that they come over to Kazakhstan and start working together with Kazakh companies. We are trying to do this - to open new oil fields.We perfectly understand that any oil filed is to run down. The Ansagan field near Tengiz gives huge hope. There Kazakhstani companies have been developing for many years already, and there is such a long-long list. But now it is necessary to untie the hands of geologists, they must be equipped with technical equipment; actually we lost qualified geologists and did not replenish them. What an educational establishment can boast that they graduate Kanysh Satpayevâ€™s followers? This is creative work, it seems to me that we went â€˜too deepâ€™ and attached more importance to technical work. We trained welders but we forgot the subsoil use creative side.- You mentioned President Nazarbayev's visit to the UK and signed documents, any results?- There are advancements but the many people were looking forward to the start of the International Financial Center Astana because they wanted to insure themselves and register these companies with IFCA. We are on friendly terms with the British Chamber of Commerce, and I heard that about 4-5 exploration companies have already registered there.- Now they say that there is nothing to look for at the depth of 3-4 km, let's go to the shelf and subsalt layers, everyone wants to start the Eurasia project. These are all complex projects and big investments, and what will happen to small and medium-sized companies in the market which supply the domestic market with crude oil?- A very serious, problematic issue. Among the oilmen such companies are called ""bucket holders"". These are companies which produce 3,000-5,000 tonnes of oil a month, and there are lots of them. First, these deposits were originally acquired by foreigners, then because of small debit and unprofitability they left them and went. At the last auction the Kazakh entities began already to buy them. People, who could earn something in 25 years, began to invest in these fields. And very successfully to be honest. I know one person, who bought really recently two more fields. Yes, this does not produce much, 3,000-5,000 tonnes a month, but fairly enough. There are about 20-30 people involved with each field. This oil output entirely goes to the domestic market.In order to make these small fields interesting, it seems to me that like in Russia we need to equalize the sale of oil both for export and for the domestic market. We have one price for export, another one for the domestic market. Everybody wants to trade for export, because the price is high. If we today announce that we will now export gasoline to Russia, then it means that these three plants [three refineries in Kazakhstan] are operating at full capacity. The factories are coping fairly well; another issue is that there are not enough raw materials.Why are we now going to ban imports of lubricants from Russia? Kazakhstani business started to buy up small fields and they supply their products to the domestic market. An unaccounted amount of crude oil has appeared in order to supply these three plants with raw materials.- Was the increase in supplies to the domestic market significant after the activation of small oil fields?- No one can give a clear answer on this.- When did Kazakhstani businessmen start actively buying up small fields?- Interest appeared as soon as oil prices stabilized. Do you understand what is interested in the oil market? As soon as the price turbulence begins, not to mention small companies, even large investors ""catch silence"". As soon as the price stabilizes, they begin to invest. Recall 2014-2015, when the oil industry investment portfolio fell completely. Now this re-started but nearer to $ 80 a barrel I have the shivers, I start fearing. Moreover, Trump's latest statement about some kind of agreement with the Saudis also causes concern. The most comfortable price, it seems to me, is $60-$65. And an investor knows what his profit will be, and the oil service would not suffer. The price if it collapses to $30, again all operators will switch in ""economy mode"" and the oilfield services industry will stand idle.- Despite the activation of small deposits, does the problem with deliveries to the domestic market remain? Was it somehow possible to satisfy the domestic market with oil due to the resumption of production at mothballed small fields or because did KMG increase supplies?- The ministry tried to raise up to 40% the domestic market [target] for private companies and the KMG [KazMunayGas] system [to oblige the companies to supply 40% of oil production to the domestic market]. Immediately many investors shut down the oil fields, turned around and left. How do they cope with this today? Most likely, a lot is provided from the KMG reserves. We are not told, of course, but we do not care where they take it. We just want no fuel and lubricant rush anymore. Because it hits the entire industry, this completely undermines the social stability of the population. Our social stability is probably worth more than foreign benefits. â€œWell doneâ€ to the Energy Ministry, which found a way out to provide the full volume [supplies to the domestic refineries] and gave up Russian gasoline, this is a job well done.Last year, when there was a gasoline price rush I was asked [this] question, then I said that all oil that the KMG system produces was to be left on the domestic market, because it is a national company. For KMG the well-being of the nation must be above all else.Let me say so - probably the share of KMG exports is reduced and the share of the domestic market increased. Because such work could not be conducted anymore further, that is they hit bottom and began to take action.- How long will it be possible to live on KMG oil? We asked the ministry whether they are starting negotiations with the three large subsoil users about oil supplies to the domestic market. They insecurely confirmed, but there was a statement already that TCO would supply raw materials to the 4 refineries.- First, no expert in Kazakhstan has yet seen the PSA at all. If I saw the PSA signed between Chevron and the Kazakh government, I could say that they noted in the PSA that in 40 years they will supply the domestic market with so and so much oil. On the rest too. Who are investors? Let's look into them; these are Agip, Eni, Shell. All those companies that have refineries and produce finished petroleum products. They invest money, supply their plants with raw materials, and, probably, when they signed something, they thought more about raw material supplies for their plant rather than about Kazakhstanâ€™s domestic market.Probably, this is stipulated somewhere in the PSA. It seems to me that no one should not make any secret of this. The minister should admit that he saw the PSA, and, for example, in 30 years a Kazakhstani citizen will head up these companies and in 35 years the major operators will supply so-and-so much percentage to the domestic market. The more secrets, the more people get angry.- Let's return to the oilfield service, for many years there was a problem with access to tenders from the companies with Chinese participation. Overstated requirements, violations of the rules for holding tenders were noted. The current minister, Kanat Bozumbayev, without disguising his irritation several times, publicly expressed his opinion on this matter. How pressing is the problem now?- The oil filed service is facing three classic types of business and three classic types of investors. First, the American one, in the person of Chevron. They have their own approach, program, standards and policies. There is the European one, in particular, NCOC and KPO, where the European companies are more involved. And the Chinese investor.As far as the first and the second ones are concerned we have learned to listen to each other at least. In case no one agrees, at least to listen to. With the third one we have not learned to talk even. Earlier this year I met with the CNPC general director; we talked friendly for three hours. They said: ""Super, Kazakhstani business is super! We will help, but we will invest nothing as long as the extension contract has not been signed."" To date there is absolute zero, the work is not conducted at all. You have figures; see how much CNPC has invested in the oilfield service. How much for drilling, for construction. This is absurd.- That is, now does CNPC not invest in its fields in Kazakhstan, pump oil out only?- They do not invest at all; they only pump out, because the work on the contract extension has not been completed.- Do they get subsoil use contracts renewed?- I have got information that lawyers are already working, they will be renewed. But it seems to me that in the new contract it is necessary to regulate all the matters that hurt Kazakhstani business. We remember the times when CNPC arrived in Kazakhstan, and those Kazakh companies that helped CNPC develop. However, seven or eight years later, these Kazakh companies became unqualified for them, and were not needed. Over this time they dragged in their subsidiaries. We ran so much from pillar to post, we fought so much, but so far we do not know how to work with the Chinese oil companies. Sometimes it seems to me that even the government officials do not know how to do this. How many meetings we have held! They have their own vision, understanding â€“ they stand fast and act on their own.In Aktobe, there is an opinion that CNPC is a company that came to Kazakhstan as an investor, and then turned Kazakhstan into its investor. Sometimes it is painful for us to realize that we are still completely losing out, no matter how hard we are trying. The only one who probably constantly contacts and points out shortcomings to them is our Union. In one year I try to meet two or three times. Sometimes I lack enough additional power, (â€¦) Atameken, KMG, even the Energy Ministry (â€¦) could prop up our work.- Was this issue brought up at the presidential level?- We wrote a letter, and I wrote to the president as well. We published about the problem in the media and that's it, the issue was closed. I do not know the secret of such impenetrability of the Chinese companies.- It was said that joint ventures would be set up with the largest foreign oilfield service companies in Kazakhstan. How many of them have already emerged?- Where did the idea of creating a joint venture come from? First, in all major projects [Tengiz, Kashagan, Karachaganak] the Kazakh companies could not become general contractors. All the time we were playing second fiddle - at the sub contractual level. The Kazakh companies were evolving, and our ambitions were also growing up. We wanted to reach the general contractorâ€™s level, but there were financial difficulties - it was necessary to insure 30% of the contract value. We, the Kazakh companies, could in no way do this. The idea of creating joint ventures and consortiums came up where a foreign company acts as a financial group, and a Kazakh company as a technical group. Having united our efforts, we begin to enter into large-scale general contracts.The first victory is already there. As part of the TCO project, the consortium Asar won one lot with participation of the Turkish company Gate as a parent company, and there are 12 Kazakh companies with it. We won the lot and became the general contractor. Now we are preparing the second consortium for commissioning works, it will be called Mura (Heritage). Wood Group will act as a parent company - the strongest in the world for commissioning, and under its umbrella we will gather the Kazakh companies. To date, more than 7 of Kazakhstani companies are willing to participate in this.Once the system had been implemented on KPO and NCOC projects, when a tender with a value of more than $ 30 million could be awarded only to a company with 50% Kazakh participation, foreign companies themselves began to look for a Kazakh partner. Participation of foreign companies not only provides for financial stability, but also the company stable growth, qualified personnel, new technologies. Our domestic companies are undergoing transformation.- By the way, is the Alash supplier base, about which there has been so much talk, working now?- Such a big name, but so far it has not produced any results yet. It seems to me that it's better to register not companies on the Alash database. Operators do not open this database at all. Even if you have passed prequalification through Alash you still have to pass it with the operators. And does this make any sense? I think it would be more productive to register our workforce there.- Thank you for the interview!* * * * *Copyright (c) 2018 Interfax-Kazakhstan.

Aug 2 (Interfax-Kazakhstan) - In Kyzylorda region the issue of reducing crude oil supplies to the domestic market is under scrutiny and as a result of that additional crude volumes could be exported with a view to boosting revenues of oil companies against the background of falling oil production, Governor of Kyzylorda Region Krymbek Kusherbayev said at a meeting with the subsoil users operating in the region.Currently oil companies in the region sell an average of 80% of produced oil on the domestic market and ship 20% for export. This issue of reviewing oil sales in a 50/50 ratio are under scrutiny. This would allow the oil companies to increase revenues. In turn, the regional administration urges the companies to use these additional funds to explore and develop new fields, Kusherbayev was quoted as saying in a press release.The region compared with the other regions suffered most from the oil price crisis as Kyzylorda region was to undertake 70% of Kazakhstan's total reduced oil production, according to the press release.Annual oil production in the region is falling by an average of 12%. Only in the last five years production has dropped by 3.7 million tonnes thereby cutting tax revenues almost threefold over this period. Despite this the oil, gas and mining industries remain the backbone of Kyzylorda region.In Kyzylorda region oil and uranium production account for more than 80% of its total industrial output.Copyright (c) 2018 Interfax.

0,"Dallas Morning News, The (TX). 06/12/2018.",Article,,,,2W62856818769,Newspaper Source,Planned Permian Basin pipeline will carry out 1 million barrels of crude oil per day,"Jeff Mosier     June 12--More help is on the way to ease the Permian Basin's pipeline shortage. Exxon Mobil and Plains All American Pipeline announced Tuesday their intent to build a 1 million-barrel-a-day crude oil pipeline.     The project would move oil from the Permian Basin (Wink and Midland) to the Texas Gulf Coast (Webster, Baytown and Beaumont). The most prolific oil field in the country is struggling with bottlenecks as rising oil prices push production higher, outpacing the available pipeline capacity to take oil out to refineries on the Gulf Coast.     That booming region in West Texas and New Mexico has pipeline capacity of about 3.1 million barrels per day compared to production of 3.3 million barrels per day, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Even with some oil being refined locally or transported elsewhere by rail, the region is pushing its capacity.     This week's announcement provided few details, such as cost or schedule. These massive pipelines usually take at least 18 months, so it's unlikely to open before 2020.     If the project goes forward, it would be one of several large pipelines planned to solve the Permian Basin capacity problem.     The EPIC crude oil pipeline -- opening in 2019 -- will provide 550,000 barrels-a-day capacity from the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford to Corpus Christi.     Houston-based Plains All American announced in February that it was going forward with its Cactus II pipeline. Opening in 2019, that would provide at least 585,000 barrels per day between the Permian Basin and the Corpus Christi area.     Phillips 66 said in April it had sufficient commitments to go ahead with its Gray Oak pipeline connecting West Texas and the Corpus Christi area. That's set to open late 2019 with at least 385,000 barrels.     This latest pipeline would transport oil for Irving-based Exxon as well as other Permian Basin producers.     Exxon would need the largest chunk of that capacity to continue with its plans to triple oil and gas production from the Permian Basin by 2025. Exxon kicked off those ambitious plans last year, when the company paid Fort Worth's Bass family as much as $6.6 billion for about 275,000 acres in the Permian Basin.     This week's pipeline announcement included that a ""priority would be placed on using existing pipeline corridors to help limit potential community and environmental disruptions.""     ___

(NYSE: EPD) today announced it is planning to develop an offshore crude oil export terminal off the Texas Gulf Coast. The terminal would be capable of fully loading Very Large Crude Carriers (“VLCC”), which have capacities of approximately 2 million barrels and provide the most efficient and cost-effective solution to export crude oil to the largest international markets in Asia and Europe.   Enterprise has started front-end engineering and design (“FEED”) and preparing applications for regulatory permitting. Based on initial designs, the project could include approximately 80 miles of 42-inch diameter pipeline to an offshore terminal capable of loading and exporting crude oil at approximately 85,000 barrels per hour.   Today, Enterprise is completing the second partial loading of a VLCC tanker at its jointly owned Seaway marine terminal in Texas City. The Eagle Victoria is loading approximately 1.1 million barrels of crude oil at the Texas City facility.   “On the heels of our second successful loading of a VLCC at the Texas City terminal, we are now planning to expand our capabilities to load crude oil faster and more cost efficiently without the need for lightering vessels,” said A.J. “Jim” Teague, chief executive officer of Enterprise’s general partner. “Given the long-term outlook for growing supplies of U.S. crude oil production, increasing global demand requiring super tankers, and the future limitations of Gulf Coast port and lightering capacities, we are confident this project will be embraced and supported by both domestic and international customers. In addition to our best in class reliability, Enterprise’s crude oil supply aggregation capabilities of over 4 million barrels per day, including from the Permian, Cushing, Eagle Ford and numerous third party connections, provide unmatched diversification, supply and quality optionality for international markets.”   “Capital and infrastructure to support our project would be solely provided by private capital and would not be reliant nor contingent upon state or federal government agency financial support or infrastructure development. We believe this would enable us to deliver this project in a timely manner once permits are granted and the project is underwritten,” stated Teague.   A final investment decision will be subject to receiving the requisite state and federal permits and customer demand.

Procurement analysts at SpendEdge highlight the following top three market trends that are contributing towards the growth of the Global Crude Oil Market:  Rise in prices of crude oil in 2017 Increase in production of crude oil in non-OPEC countries in MEA Decline in operating costs of suppliers due to higher efficiency  This report is available at USD 1000 discount for a limited time only: View the report snapshot before purchasing   Rise in prices of crude oil in 2017   Although the crude oil prices showed a radical decline in the year 2008, the industry gradually witnessed a promising growth, registering a 10% increase from January 2017 to December 2017. The rise in crude oil prices can also be attributed to factors such as a gradual increase in the gasoline prices and the growing need to meet the demand-supply balance. In addition, the rise in the crude oil prices is also expected to bring financial stability to the market, thereby providing the necessary boost to suppliers.   Increase in production of crude oil in non-OPEC countries in MEA   The non-OPEC nations that were exempted from the production cuts proposed by OPEC, increased their production capacities in 2017. The decline in the prices of the crude oil not only affected the economies of these countries but by increasing their volumes in production, these economies were able to compete better and intensify their competition among the suppliers in the market. In addition, the buyers were able to better negotiate with the suppliers in terms of the prices.   Decline in operating costs of suppliers due to higher efficiency   Amid the after effects of crude oil prices on the cash flows and profit margins of the suppliers, the suppliers were able to improve their production capabilities by improving the volume of light crude oil. In addition, with the adoption of advanced technologies such as automation and digitization into the existing architecture, the companies were able to reduce their operating costs and enhance their profit margins. Moreover, the buyers were also able to procure crude oil at comparatively lower prices.   Get unlimited access to all our reports.

Note: The Silver Creek Midway Terminal, Iron Horse Pipeline, and Tallgrass Guernsey Terminal are under construction. (Graphic: Business Wire)   In addition to forming the joint venture, Tallgrass has agreed and signed definitive documents to sell its 50-mile PRB crude oil gathering system to Silver Creek (formerly owned by Outrigger Energy). Tallgrass and Silver Creek expect to close the formation of the joint venture and the sale of Tallgrass Crude Gathering, LLC later this month.   The transaction gives Silver Creek an immediate presence in the PRB and provides a strategic footprint as it constructs additional gathering to cover the core of the PRB. The acquired gathering system alongside the newly constructed Silver Creek gathering system will deliver into the Silver Creek Midway Terminal, which will deliver barrels to Iron Horse. As a result of the acquisition and announced projects, Silver Creek will be positioned as the preeminent crude oil gathering company in the PRB.   As part of the joint venture, Tallgrass has agreed to contribute approximately 40 miles of pipe from Labonte, Wyo. to Guernsey, Wyo. This pipe is currently owned by Tallgrass Interstate Gas Transmission, LLC, and is undergoing abandonment from gas service. Tallgrass will be a 75 percent owner and will operate the approximately 80-mile, 16” pipeline, which consists of 40 miles of new build and the 40 miles of gas-to-oil conversion pipe. Silver Creek will own the remaining 25 percent. Iron Horse is anticipated to be in-service Q1 2019 with an expected initial capacity of about 100,000 barrels per day with significant available expansion capacity. After conversations with both producers and marketers in the PRB, the parties anticipate a significant amount of the Iron Horse’s initial capacity will be contracted prior to the pipeline being placed into service, and depending on commitments obtained, capacity could be expanded above the 100,000 barrels per day currently planned.   The combined systems of Silver Creek and Tallgrass intend to leverage each company’s asset footprint, providing producers in the PRB gathering and transportation services from wellhead to final sale point. “Silver Creek is extremely excited to work with Tallgrass in the PRB. Their current presence in the basin and long-haul crude transport capabilities bring a competitive advantage to Silver Creek as we work to fully build out our gathering system. Collectively, we will be able to provide optimal midstream service solutions for producers in the Powder River Basin,” said J. Patrick Barley, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Silver Creek.   “Silver Creek brings a best-in-class oil gathering management team to the PRB,” said Matt Sheehy, Tallgrass’s Chief Commercial Officer. “Their extensive customer relationships and focus on customer service make them an ideal partner for Tallgrass. Iron Horse Pipeline will quickly become an important path to bring Wyoming production into Guernsey and onto Pony Express.”   Tallgrass anticipates that it will invest approximately $150 million into this initiative, including its proportionate share of the cost to construct the Iron Horse Pipeline and the new Tallgrass Guernsey Terminal, but excluding the proceeds from the sale of its PRB gathering system.

The global shale oil market to grow at a CAGR of 5.07% during the period 2018-2022.   Global Shale Oil Market 2018-2022, has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market.   One trend in the market is supercritical carbon dioxide in shale oil fracking. Hydraulic fracturing or fracking process uses gallons of water and chemicals for opening the pores of the rock formation. However, non-aqueous fracking fluids such as supercritical carbon dioxide have been increasingly adopted as a replacement of water in the fracking process.   According to the report, one driver in the market is increasing consumption of oil and natural gas. With the rising industrialization and urbanization, the consumption of oil and gas has increased considerably over the last few years. According to this research report on the shale oil market, this increased consumption of crude oil and gas across different end-user segments will be one of the key factors fueling the market's growth during the next few years.   Further, the report states that one challenge in the market is uncertainties associated with low crude oil prices. The oil and gas industry depend vastly on the commodity prices. Any fluctuation in the crude oil prices defines the performance of the majority of the upstream sector companies.

[ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,7EH142580195,Newspaper Source,"For a petrolhead, bathing in crude oil was a must. But, ooh, it gave me the willies","Every week the vain and the underemployed are invited to try out a new type of diet involving nothing but cucumber sandwiches, or a new kind of yoga-based exercise routine developed by monks in China. Gimmickry is the key. No one's going to try something they've tried before. Because if it had worked, they wouldn't be back.In fact, no one's going to try anything anyone's tried before. Everything needs to be the next big thing.Spas are particularly susceptible to this. You can't just ask customers to eat lettuce and go for a long walk. They need to get their nourishment by nicking the rear end of an organic cow and sucking the blood that spurts out.And they need to exercise at absolute zero while humming excerpts from Tubular Bells. And everything has to have a Tibetan name. ""Tara. It's time for your Vajrayana bath.""Bathing used to happen in water, but that's no good any more. Unless it's piped directly from Lhasa. You need to bathe in honey, or liquefied yak's cheese. In Georgia there's a spa where you can bathe in wine. And I don't buy into any of it.However, on a trip last week to Azerbaijan I was told of a clinic where customers could bathe in oil. And I don't mean olive oil or the oil you get from an orang-utan's house.I mean crude oil. The raw material that's used to make everything that matters: balloons, skis, crash helmets, pens, speedboats, elderly film stars' faces, doors, coffee machines, bottles and, of course, at the top of the list, petrol.I had to try it. It would be like baptising myself in the church of speed.So it was off to the back streets of Baku, where I found the clinic. It's not like the sort of thing you see in the Emmanuelle films. There was no steam or pebbles or whale song played on pan pipes.It was, as you'd probably expect in this former Soviet colony, a bit Russian. Wipe-down walls, furniture from the People's Chair Factory No 45 and an ECG machine that you felt could monitor electrical activity in the body and, at the flick of a switch, increase it dramatically.A nurse ordered me into a room with flickery fluorescent lighting and asked: ""How old you are?"" I replied: ""Twenty-four."" So she wrote ""24"" on her form. ""I was joking,"" I said. ""I'm 117."" She fixed me with the exact same look as the fake general got from his nurse in Where Eagles Dare.Later a doctor explained that I needed to be checked because bathing in crude oil is not for the weak. More than 10 minutes in there, for example, and you get cancer.That's a downside, for sure, but the upsides seemed immense. ""It is good"", said the doctor, ""for your kidneys, your liver, your skin, your circulation, your heart and your, how you say, penis."" With that I was taken into what was easily the most disgusting room I'd ever seen in my whole life. And this is a man who went to the lavatory once on a Chinese steam train in the Eighties.They'd tried to enliven things with a pot of fake flowers and some batterypowered candles — the real thing might have been a bit risky — but the walls looked as though they'd been decorated by Bobby Sands, and the ancient bath from the People's Bath Factory No 12 was full of what looked like hot sewage.I climbed in and at first it was nice. I can see why seabirds are so happy to take the plunge whenever a tanker crashes into Alaska. But then it was time to get out, and that led to the most humiliating and revolting episode of my entire life.You'll be able to see the bathing scene on The Grand Tour next year, but what happened afterwards? No. Not a chance.The first problem was getting out. Oil is skiddy, which means you simply cannot stand up in the bath, leave alone lift a leg over the side, which means you need assistance.This comes in the shape of a small Azerbaijani man, whose face, when he's finally got you standing, is level with your gentleman sausage.Hanging on to him for dear life, I'm eventually out of the bath and clinging desperately to a coat hook, while mateyboy reaches for a shoehorn. He uses this to scrape the oil off my back and thighs, but even I can see he's getting nowhere. As guillemots know, oil clings.It is also entirely unbothered by water, a point that becomes obvious as he slithers me across the tiled floor to the tiny shower. Here, I look down to see what benefits have been bestowed on my penis, but other than the fact it's now black, there appear to be none.Someone is going to have to make it white again. And I can't see how that might be me. The floor is now coated in a thick veneer of soap and crude oil, and that means I need both hands to hold on to the shower-head mounting, and ... oh my God, he's washing it. And now he's on his knees and he's washing it quite quickly and I'm worried that, unless he stops, this could result in a very unhappy happy ending. And then we had to get it out of the cavities.It took half an hour to get enough oil off and out of my body that I could walk past a naked flame without exploding, and an hour in a bubble bath before my toenails became visible. And did I feel any better? No. All the organic Tibetan downward dogs and all the whale song bathing are just anecdotes to keep the dinner party going until everyone gets talking about what box sets they're watching. If you want to get thin and healthy, eat less and walk more. The end. Source: Sunday Times, The, Oct 14, 2018, p29, 1pItem: 7EH142580195"

[ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,bizwire.c84308817,Regional Business News,"East Daley: U.S. Oil and Gas Midstream Sector To Grow By 14% in 2018, Propelled By Crude Oil Production Growth In the Permian Basin"," East Daley Capital Advisors, Inc., an energy information and insights provider that is redefining how markets view risk for midstream and exploration and production (E&P) companies, reports that the overall outlook is positive for most major U.S. oil and gas midstream companies. However, delays in Northeast natural gas pipeline projects and recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) tax policies are putting downward pressure on midstream companies with natural gas exposure.   “We see the U.S. midstream sector growing by 14% in 2018 versus 2017, which is great news for investors and midstream companies,” said Justin Carlson, VP and Managing Director, Research at East Daley Capital. “Permian crude oil and natural gas liquids production is really fueling the growth in the sector and 2018 looks to be a rebound year for many midstream companies. Now is a great time to look closely at midstream investment opportunities.”   The surge in crude oil production has translated to a quicker than expected ramp in volumes on Permian export pipelines. Many of the marginal growth barrels are charged the higher walk-up tariff rates providing a boost to the margin per barrel realized on throughput. Additionally, takeaway constraints have caused regional spreads from Midland to Cushing, Houston and the Louisiana Light Sweet hubs to widen significantly. The significant uptick in crude oil production benefits companies like Plains All American Pipeline (PAA), Enterprise Products Partners (ETP) and Magellan Midstream Partners (MMP), which East Daley has a more favorable view of versus consensus EBITDA estimates.   “Even though we see many midstream companies with natural gas exposure growing in 2018, delayed infrastructure projects in the Northeast and FERC’s recent announcement to changes in tax policies have put downward pressure on earnings expectations,” said Carlson. “Rover pipeline expansion delays, the Mariner East 1 shut down and Mariner East 2 project delays will cause lower throughput and cash flows for companies such as Antero Midstream, CNX Midstream and MPLX.”   East Daley recommends investors in midstream oil and gas companies to look closely at the details of the new FERC rulings and how those rulings apply to specific assets in midstream companies when evaluating risk. However, East Daley views the impacts of the FERC tax policies will have a modest downside risk on midstream companies EBITDA, with most companies ranging from 0-5% of EBITDA at risk potentially, even though outliers do exist.

Even as the countryâ€™s import bill has been ballooning on account of the spiralling global crude prices, Indiaâ€™s domestic crude production in September fell by 4.19 percent compared the same period a year ago.The slide in crude production last month is 6.59 percent lower than the countryâ€™s target production set for the month.According to the latest data released by Indiaâ€™s petroleum ministry, the countryâ€™s crude oil production fell for the sixth straight year in 2017-18 to 35.68 million tonne, pushing the countryâ€™s import dependence for crude further to 82.8 percent.The steady decline in production is bound to upset India's plan to cut reliance on energy imports by 10 per cent through 2022.Cumulative crude oil during April-September 2018 was 4.05 percent lower than target for the period, the ministry data showed.Crude oil production has been on a decline primarily due to fall in output from nearly all offshore and onshore blocks.The fall in the countryâ€™s crude oil production comes at a time Indiaâ€™s oil import bill is expected to increase by 20 percent to $105 billion in 2018-2019 on the back of recent rally in global oil prices.Indiaâ€™s natural gas production also registered a marginal fall in September 2018, declining 1.43 percent lower than a year ago. The September 2018 natural gas production was 7.56 percent lower than the target for the monthDuring April-September 2018, the natural gas production was 0.96 percent higher at 16254.65 MMSCM compared to the corresponding period of last year. The gas production during this period, however, was 7.75 percent lower than target for the period.On an annual basis, domestic natural gas production in 2017-2018 grew by 2.35 percent. Data shows the countryâ€™s natural gas production grew for the first time in a few years, as output from onshore blocks offset the decline from offshore blocks last fiscal.Refinery production in terms of crude oil processed during September, 2018 was 2.18 percent higher than the target for the month and 1.28 percent higher compared with September, 2017.Cumulative production during April-September, 2018 was 2.09 percent higher than the target for the period and 5.03 percent higher than the production during corresponding period of last year.Â© 2018 ITP DIGITAL Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

[ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,bizwire.c85571515,Regional Business News,"Oryx Midstream Services II, LLC Launches Binding Open Season for Regional Crude Oil Gathering and Transportation System in the Delaware Basin"," Oryx Midstream Services II, LLC announced today that its operating subsidiaries, Oryx Delaware Oil Gathering NM LLC, Oryx Delaware Oil Gathering TX LLC, Oryx Western Delaware Oil Gathering LLC and Oryx Delaware Oil Transport LLC (collectively, “Oryx”), have launched a joint binding open season to secure volume commitments and/or acreage dedications to support the previously-announced regional crude oil gathering and trunk line transportation systems, which will serve the liquids-rich Delaware Basin in Texas and New Mexico. The binding open season commenced today, July 10, 2018 at 8 a.m. CDT and is scheduled to conclude at 5 p.m. CDT on August 9, 2018.   Based on customer demand, Oryx has expanded the scope of the original project to include additional capacity and a larger footprint across the Delaware Basin. The new system is expected to consist of approximately 400 miles of new gathering and transportation pipeline, with approximately 650,000 barrels per day of throughput capacity and more than 1.5 million barrels of storage capacity. The new gathering and transportation system will span the Delaware Basin and is expected to provide services to Lea and Eddy counties in New Mexico and Loving, Reeves, Ward, Winkler and Culberson counties in Texas. A map of the new system can be found here.   Construction on the new system has begun and the regional transportation pipeline, which will connect Oryx’s Carlsbad station to the Crane and Midland market hubs, is expected to be fully commissioned during the fourth quarter of this year. The full system is expected to be complete in the second quarter of 2019. Upon completion, and when combined with Oryx Midstream Services, LLC’s assets (operated by Oryx Southern Delaware Oil Gathering and Transport LLC), Oryx’s total Delaware Basin system capacity will exceed 850,000 barrels per day.   “We are pleased to launch this open season to support the construction of incremental transportation and gathering capacity in the rapidly expanding Delaware Basin. The new system extension and storage footprint allows us to provide crude oil segregation and connectivity for our customers in the Texas and New Mexico areas of the northern Delaware Basin to multiple takeaway options, providing the flexibility and market opportunities they need to maximize the value of their production,” said Brett Wiggs, Oryx Midstream Services’ chief executive officer. “Rapid production growth has increased the need for access to gathering capacity and more efficient transportation logistics across the basin. We are focused on the execution of this project in the proposed timeframe to provide our customers with much-needed relief from rate variability and administrative and operational burdens associated with trucking alternatives.”   Open Season Information   The binding open season process provides potential shippers with the opportunity to make volume commitments or acreage dedications to Oryx Delaware Oil Gathering NM LLC, Oryx Delaware Oil Gathering TX LLC and Oryx Western Delaware Oil Gathering LLC and or Oryx Delaware Oil Transport LLC by executing gathering and/or transportation services contracts with Oryx.

0,Khaleej Times (7/2008 to 4/2009). 07/11/2018.,Article,,,,2W6383656037,Newspaper Source,Will crude oil prices hit $120 per barrel?,"Issac John     July 11--DUBAI -- Oil prices could jump steeply to cross $120 per barrel in a not-to-be ruled out scenario of zero Iranian exports combined with Opec's lack of preparedness to offset the huge supply deficit, market analysts said.     Iran, the fourth-largest oil producer, accounts for five per cent of global oil supply and cutting its exports to zero could push oil up by $50 barrels per day (bpd) if Saudi cannot keep up, said analysts at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.     Oil is now a game of chicken. If the US administration were to order a complete cutoff of Iranian barrels before the end of the year, oil could surge to more than $120 a barrel, analysts argued.     Brent, the international benchmark, is currently trading at around $77 a barrel, up more than 25 per cent this year.     ""We estimate that every million bpd shift in supply and demand balances would push the oil price by $17 bpd on average. So based on those assumptions, we estimate zero Iran exports could push oil up by $50 if Saudi Arabia caps out,"" BofA Merrill Lynch analysts said.     They argued that since Saudi Arabia had never pumped more than 10.6 million bpd, could it now increase production and make up for any missing Iranian volumes?     More recent history shows Saudi Arabia has never produced more than 10.6 million bpd on average over a single month. ""And even in the recent period, we have observed a steep decline in domestic Saudi oil inventories. Thus, it appears the oil market has little confidence that Iran volumes can be easily replaced,"" BofA Merrill Lynch analysts said.     ""In this game of chicken, we expect someone will blink before that happens,"" they wrote.     However, Opec and its allies are doing what they can to offset crude output shortfalls that have kept global supplies tight and prices high, but they don't want to overdo it, according to UAE Minister of Energy and Industry Suhail bin Mohammed Faraj Faris Al Mazrouei.     The minister said it is important to avoid bringing the market back to the kind of excessive supply that triggered the recent downturn. ""It's unfair to say that Opec is not doing its part,"" Al Mazrouei, who's also serving as president of Opec, said in a TV interview with Bloomberg BNN in Calgary. ""There are things outside of our hand, the geopolitics as well as how much production is coming from the shale oil and Canadian sands.""     Iran's Opec governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili was quoted in June as saying that oil prices could jump to $140 a barrel due to the US sanctions against the country and Venezuela. The Iranian official also criticised a reported request that the United States made of Saudi Arabia to help stabilise oil prices in case the sanctions against Iran drives oil prices up.     MUFG Bank, a leading Japanese bank, said renewed geopolitical supply-side disruptions stemming from Canada, Iran, Libya, Venezuela and the US, raises the likelihood of oil trade interruptions and with it upside risks to oil prices in the near term. So much can change in oil markets in the course of a few weeks.     ""Putting an actual nominal level of geopolitical risk, supply crunch concerns as well as Opec plus compliance shirking into the current level of oil prices is challenging, but we view that at least an upside risk of Brent and WTI exceeding north of $85 and $80, respectively, in Q3 2018, depending on the magnitude of these disruptions and how they impact the overall supply-demand balance,"" Ehsan Khoman, head of Research and Strategist for Mena at MUFG, said.     Despite upside risks, analysts view that prices are in fact approaching the point where they are becoming a concern for consumers and also for producers. ""As such, we believe that a sustained period of Brent above $80 and $75 for WTI will lead to demand destruction becoming more likely, through a combination of enhanced efficiency and a slowdown in the global economy,"" analysts said. -- issacjohn@khaleejtimes.com     ___

Brent crude, the global benchmark, dropped 6.9 per cent to $US73.40 in its worst day since February 2016.Libya’s state-run National Oil lifted force majeure on eastern oil ports yesterday after the ports were handed back from an armed faction, paving the way for a resumption of full production. Analysts estimate that could add hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil a day to the market and ease fears of a supply shortage.After oil had rallied back to near its highest level since 2014 earlier in the week, analysts said the news started a pattern of selling that picked up as the day went on.“We were ripe for a correction — here it is,” said John Saucer, vice-president of research and analysis at Mobius Risk Group in Houston. “I really think this is your classic long liquidation technical sell-off.” Oil had rallied sharply in recent weeks as supply issues around the world bolstered the market and bullish speculative investors added to positions. Libya’s unplanned outage was among the biggest drivers, but other factors include problems in Canada, strikes in Norway and US sanctions against Iran.Oil prices extended their losses even after US stockpile data showed inventories fell 12.6 million barrels last week, a much larger drop than analysts had expected. The data came after inventories surprisingly increased a week earlier and shows that the US is still in a tightly supplied environment, according to John Kilduff, founding partner at Again Capital.Although he expected the supply picture to continue to underpin prices, Mr Kilduff said the market was more focused on the Libya news.Traders were also weighing news that Saudi Arabia told the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries yesterday that its oil output rose last month, nearing levels not seen since the country embarked on production cuts in 2016, with the rise starting before the group decided to increase cartel production in late June. The kingdom has been under pressure from the US to fill the production gap.Copyright of Australian, The is the property of News Limited Australia.

It warned in early March that OPEC and Russia need to rethink future output plans in light of the U.S. shale boom.The U.S. is seen to potentially overtake Russia as the No. 1 oil producer, with output topping 11 million barrels a day as soon as this year.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalThis Could Be Next Big Oil & Gas 'Super-Basin' After PermianConocoPhillips: We 'Didn't Drill Our Brains Out' Like Shale Rivals DidWhy Saudi Aramco Isn't Worried About EVs, Peak Oil; IPO Is Going WellContinental Resources, Parsley Energy, Matador Beat, See Output GrowthBy APARNA NARAYANANCopyright of Investors Business Daily is the property of Investor's Business Daily and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

[ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,bizwire.c85370322,Regional Business News,ICE Brent Crude Marks 30th Year as Leading Global Oil Benchmark; TAIFEX to Launch Taiwanese Dollar Brent Futures," Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading operator of global exchanges and clearing houses and provider of data and listings services, marked the 30th anniversary of its Brent futures complex, which serves as the primary reference price for global crude oil.   The ICE Brent futures contract was established following the discovery of the Forties and Brent North Sea oilfields in the 1970s. The product specification of the contract has evolved along with the commercial market, enabling it to reflect global supply and demand fundamentals and to reflect changes and investment in drilling technology, as well as new fields and discoveries. Since then, ICE has introduced over 500 futures and options contracts based on crude and refined oil, many of which are related to Brent.   In addition, the Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX) and ICE Futures Europe have entered into an agreement for TAIFEX to licence the ICE Brent Index and subsequently offer trading in Brent futures for Taiwanese participants from July 2, 2018.   The launch of TAIFEX Brent futures provides the opportunity for both commercial and retail participants in Taiwan to trade the leading crude oil benchmark in their local currency and regulatory jurisdiction and follows increasing demand across the region for access to the deep and diverse liquidity and participation that underpins the Brent market.   Stuart Williams, President, ICE Futures Europe said: “As we celebrate the 30th anniversary of Brent this month, it continues to be an exciting time for the world’s oil benchmark and we are delighted to enter into an agreement with TAIFEX for the exchange to offer Brent futures to their customers.”   Dr. Len-Yu Liu, Chairman of TAIFEX said: “It’s a great pleasure to work with ICE to launch this product. We believe a local currency-denominated and small-sized contract will better cater for retail participants and allow local investors to trade the world’s oil benchmark without bearing currency risk. This cooperation product shall benefit both exchanges.”   Brent futures were first traded on the floor of the International Petroleum Exchange in June 1988. The contract has subsequently delivered 21 years of consecutive annual trading volume records. With ICE’s introduction of electronic trading in 2005, Brent’s share of the global oil market doubled and the Brent futures market became more accessible to participants around the world. Today, participants from the US and Europe to the Middle East and Asia trade more than 1 million ICE Brent futures and options contracts each trading day, representing over 1 billion barrels.

Topics mentioned include the pick up of the momentum in theoilindustry in 2017, the recovery of prices and earnings after the downturn, and the stretch of the Brakkenoilfields from North Dakota and Montana into Canada.",1110,128771592,Regional Business News,"Crude Oil Prices Are Up Sharply, But Is The Bakken Shale Play Back?","Three years after the start of the global oil glut, crude oil prices are rising and oil industry momentum is picking up.U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate traded on Wednesday 55% above a June 2017 low. In January, crude oil prices recovered above $65 a barrel for the first time since December 2012.During the downturn, Texas' Permian and Eagle Ford basins rose to become the star shale oil performers with investors. Now, as industry earnings and crude oil prices continue to recover, investors are looking further afield.The shale oil fields of the Bakken stretch north from Montana and North Dakota into Canada. The region hosted some of the first stages of the shale oil revolution. But Bakken output peaked in late 2014, then fell off sharply as crude oil prices collapsed due to a worldwide glut.During the downturn, a number of Bakken producers declared bankruptcy. Others sold assets and shifted their focus to other regions. The Permian and Eagle Ford fields emerged as the premier U.S. shale oil plays. More than a few boomtowns fell quiet in North Dakota and Montana.Today, the Bakken is regaining steam. Production levels are approaching their 2014 peak. Analysts are turning bullish on Bakken shale play holdouts, including Oasis Petroleum (OAS), Continental Resources (CLR), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), Hess (HES) and ConocoPhillips (COP).It's ""the number one play"" for investors looking to diversify beyond Permian holdings, said Derrick Whitfield, managing director at Stifel.A meeting a week ago between President Trump and a member of the Saudi royal family sent crude oil prices higher. The reason: speculation that the U.S. planned to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and impose fresh sanctions. Trump's appointments of John Bolton and CIA Director Mike Pompeo, both aggressive hawks, bolstered this view.In addition, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia are reportedly discussing a production deal that could range to 20 years. Their current agreement props prices by trimming 1.8 million barrels of oil per day from the market. It runs through the end of this year.Production in Texas' Permian has been going gangbusters for some time. But the recent rise in crude oil prices has prompted increased activity in shale oil fields with higher break-even prices. That includes the Bakken.WTI oil at $55 to $60 per barrel means ""things start to get interesting in the Bakken,"" said Benjamin Shattuck, research director for Wood Mackenzie's Lower 48 unit. Crude prices closed the week at $64.94 a barrel.Five years ago, the break-even price for a barrel of oil in the 200,000 square mile Bakken play ran between $70 and $80. Today, that break-even price is closer to $50 to $60, according to Wood Mackenzie data.That's still significantly higher than the Permian's average break-even. Mackenzie says that runs from the high $30s to mid-$40. But it still provides a healthy profit when prices provide enough margin.The Bakken is one basin that ""will be incredibly sensitive to price, the most sensitive of the big three oil plays. But what's unique and interesting is that it's very predictable. We know when we drill a well, what it will be like,"" Shattuck said.The geology of the Bakken is more straightforward than that of the Permian, according to Trisha Curtis, president and co-founder of PetroNerds, an energy analytics and advising firm. Curtis says the Bakken is ""like an Oreo cookie:"" made up of a main reservoir, held in place by two shale areas on either side.That well-defined geology has allowed Continental Resources and other key Bakken players to stake out the basin's prime acreage. New players can't infiltrate these areas unless they buy assets from owners looking to head south to Texas.The Permian, on the other hand, has a ""muddy layering""of sub-basins and subplays. This allows operators to find top-producing wells outside the core acreage, but only after risky and expensive exploration.The Bakken has benefited from advances in well drilling and completion techniques. They are essentially the same advances that have helped lower costs and break-even prices across most shale oil basins.""The completion design has changed. There is some degree of geosteering that has improved the (Bakken),"" Whitfield said. ""Proppant loads have increased. You're more effectively stimulating the reservoir today.""EIA data show a rising number of drilled but uncompleted wells being restarted in the Bakken. Those DUC wells were drilled, then capped, before the downturn. They come back online as prices rise, needing only to be ""completed"" by services companies. Prices for pressure pumping and other completion services related to hydraulic fracturing are lower now than they were as production peaked in 2014. Those costs will eventually rise. But, for now, they help to lower producers' break-even costs.The Permian and the Bakken are the most well-developed U.S. shale oil basins. But both continue to face bottleneck issues. Those issues relate primarily to the takeaway capacity of rail terminals and pipelines. Water supply limitations and truck congestion can also be problems.The Bakken went through the worst of that phase in 2008 to 2010, Whitfield says.""A lot of the Bakken from the logistical perspective, like rail and pipe, was all established back during the period,"" Whitfield said. ""It's very capital efficient to grow in the Bakken now. You don't have to build more terminals.""Outflow from the Bakken received a boost in June last year. That's when the Dakota Access pipeline -- the subject of a year-long protest at South Dakota's Standing Rock Sioux Reservation -- launched operations. The line delivers Bakken oil to a hub in Illinois. The hub then feeds Midwestern refineries around the always thirsty Chicago market.The Dakota Access has a total eventual capacity of 570,000 barrels per day. Rail transport, such as that which supplies oil to the Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery, still accounts for as much as 70% of Bakken's take away. But the new pipeline helps drive down the delivery cost of Bakken oil.Another price benefit may come from sand. The Permian's soaring demand for local sand in Texas could help lower fracking sand costs in the Bakken. Some high-quality northern white sand once shipped out of Wisconsin to Texas is now likely to be redirected to the Bakken, Whitfield suggests. The increased supply could force competing sand vendors to lower prices.Last month, Texas-based Smart Sand (SND) announced a $15.5 million deal to expand its facilities in the Bakken. The deal provided rights to the Van Hook train terminal for unloading sand. That outlet will help digest added supply from the Wisconsin frac sand mine it expanded earlier this year.The Bakken's recovering production follows a shift among exploration and production companies away from spending to chase rising oil prices.""Producers are more focused on bringing cash to the bottom line than in the past, when they were more interested in developing proven resources,"" said James Williams, an economist at energy consultant WTRG.While the Bakken is getting increased attention, Curtis said there won't be a rush of new players, such as has been the case in the Permian.""I wouldn't say it's back. I would say you have core players in the Bakken that are running with it, that it was their baby and that's going to drive it,"" Curtis said.But so long as prices hold near $60, the Bakken will play a critical role in keeping U.S. shale oil production on an uptrend into the 2020s, Williams says.""I mean, we are going to keep increasing production at well over 1 million barrels per day a year unless prices collapse,"" Williams said.

His comments were embargoed for release on Monday.The Trump administration wants nations to cut all imports of Iranian oil starting in November, when the U.S. reimposes sanctions vs. Tehran.The renewed sanctions follow President Trump's decision to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal agreed to between Iran, the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and the European Union.Mnuchin said he plans to meet with counterparts from developed and developing countries at the G-20 finance ministers' meeting in Buenos Aires on July 19-22.The sanctions are likely to be a hot topic of discussion at the summit.Total was the first oil company to announce that it is pulling out of Iran. The French oil major said it would not be able to continue its South Pars 11 gas development project and will unwind all operations in Iran before Nov. 4 unless it's granted a waiver by the U.S. government. It remains to be seen whether it could be granted a waiver.A secondary sanction would be a major loss for the company. It said more than 90% of Total's financial operation comes from U.S. banks. In addition, U.S. assets account for over $10 billion of capital employed.Total assured investors that leaving Iran wouldn't impact its production-growth targets.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:These 5 Dow Jones Stocks Are Near Buy Points After Forming Bullish BasesWhich Companies Are Now Outperforming 95% Of All Stocks?How To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple RoutineBy MICHAEL LARKINCopyright of Investors Business Daily is the property of Investor's Business Daily and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

The supply shortfalls could weigh on demand growth, though the IEA kept its 2018 and 2019 global demand growth outlook flat at 1.4 million bpd.On Wednesday, OPEC said it sees global oil demand surpassing 100 million bpd for the first time next year, but the oil group warned that trade tensions could weigh on demand.By GILLIAN RICHCopyright of Investors Business Daily is the property of Investor's Business Daily and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

Last week an aide to Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak reported that a change in the dates for introduction of the measure was discussed at a meeting Kozak held. Media reports previously said introduction of the mechanism might be moved up to October 1, 2018.""Nothing is being moved,"" Trunin said.""No decisions at all have been made this year. This year we have no [financing] source for introducing the damping component,"" he said.In addition, Trunin said a proposed reduction in the domestic market price for gasoline and diesel fuel contained in the formula for calculating the damping component would boost the cost to the budget by 60%.The gasoline and diesel price contained in the current formula for calculating the damping component will cost the budget 400 billion rubles in 2019. Reducing those prices by 5,600 rubles and 5,000 rubles respectively would increase the cost next year by 230 billion rubles.""The maximum size of the damping bonus in 2019 totals 400 billion rubles in 2019 in accordance with the existing standard, it another 230 billion rubles is added, it totals 630 billion rubles,"" Trunin said.""If you look at the figure 630 billion rubles, that is exactly equal to the amount that the budget will receive from the increase in the VAT rate by 2 percentage points.

""The issues are being discussed and haven't been discussed in full. There is no final decision. We are proposing our version. We believe that any mechanism is possible, we don't deny it.

The export price is calculated using a formula that depends on the price of gasoline and diesel fuel at Rotterdam, transport costs, the size of the export duty and excises on oil products, the ruble exchange rate and the VAT rate. The domestic price is set statutorily. According to the bill, the average wholesale price for one tonne of Ai-92 gasoline is taken as 56,000 rubles in 2019, 58,800 rubles in 2020 and 61,740 rubles in 2021. The average wholesale price of diesel fuel in that period is respectively 50,000 rubles, 52,500 rubles and 55,125 rubles.The oil companies argue that given current growth in fuel excise taxes and the VAT rate, the damping component will be insufficient to compensate their losses.

0,All Things Considered (NPR). 09/19/2016.,Transcript,,,,6XN201609192003,Newspaper Source,Planet Money Explores The Value Of Crude Oil.,"ARI SHAPIRO: We're going to listen in now on what might be the most awkward negotiation in the history of the oil business. Robert Smith and Stacey Vanek Smith of our Planet Money podcast drove to a field in the Midwest with a briefcase full of a hundred dollar bills. They thought the best way to understand the oil business is to get into the oil business - buying it, transporting it and refining it.As we heard on MORNING EDITION, to get the legal standing to do that took months of paperwork. Once they had the green light, Robert and Stacey had to set their price.STACEY VANEK SMITH: Our crude oil has been waiting for this moment for millions of years underneath what is now a cow pasture in Kansas.ROBERT SMITH: That's where we meet up with Jason Bruns in that cow pasture. He's the man pumping the oil into a big, black tank.(SOUNDBITE OF OIL PUMP JACK CHURNING)VANEK SMITH: Oh, that's deep. Can you yell something down there?JASON BRUNS: Hello (echoing).VANEK SMITH: He says there's oil down there, and it seems legit. But we don't know yet how much it's worth.SMITH: It always seems like there's one price for oil that goes up and down.VANEK SMITH: But every individual oil deal is different. Jason makes a pitch that his oil is worth more.BRUNS: It's sweet oil. It's good oil. It's light oil. It's not thick. It's not heavy-crude. It's the sweet-crude - what people want.SMITH: That means it's easier to refine into gasoline. Less work for the refinery means it should fetch a higher price.VANEK SMITH: And then there was the matter of transportation. It's hard to truck crude oil, so the closer to the refinery, the higher the price. Jason says this oil is mere miles from the big pipelines of Oklahoma.BRUNS: The more southern Kansas you are, the sweeter your crude is, the more they pay.VANEK SMITH: So it's like location, location, location.BRUNS: Yeah.SMITH: Now, on the way over here, we had heard on the radio that oil was selling worldwide for $40 a barrel. But Jason - he pulls out his phone, and he shows us a long list of what oil's been fetching around these parts.BRUNS: Oklahoma Sweet - that's our column. Right now the average on Oklahoma Sweet is $41.83 for the month.VANEK SMITH: I thought it was Kansas Sweet, though.SMITH: Yeah, we are in Kansas. Are you pulling a fast one on us?BRUNS: Yeah, we are in Kansas.VANEK SMITH: Why should we pay Oklahoma Sweet prices?BRUNS: Because that's what the other oil trucks that will come, if you don't get it, will pay me (laughter).SMITH: I pull up another list of prices lower than Jason's prices on my phone. And then he makes a counteroffer.BRUNS: Forty-one-eighty probably.SMITH: Well, you just knocked three cents - (laughter) he just knocked three cents off of that.BRUNS: (Laughter) I feel you. I mean that's kind of what I was thinking.VANEK SMITH: We did offer to throw in lunch.SMITH: And I bring out our secret weapon. I open up a black briefcase. And I show him what's inside.BRUNS: Oh, yeah - cash money - yeah (laughter).VANEK SMITH: In one hundred dollar bills - Jason is beaming, and he agrees to $40 a barrel.SMITH: One-hundred barrels - almost enough to fill a tanker truck.Let's do the handshake - all right.BRUNS: All right - deal.VANEK SMITH: That was, like, a $4,000 handshake.BRUNS: I mean, not that I don't trust, but let me count this. It'll be all right (laughter).SMITH: Now, there are taxes to be paid. There will be paperwork.VANEK SMITH: Lots of paperwork.SMITH: But essentially Planet Money, NPR now owns a truck full of oil.VANEK SMITH: Now we just have to figure out a way to get it out of here.

Through this binding open season, Delaware Express and Medallion expect to make up to 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) available for Joint Tariff service, with up to 180,000 bpd available to committed shippers at volume incentive rates under long-term transportation agreements (Transportation Services Agreements), providing for either acreage dedications or volume commitments. The proposed Joint Tariff service will provide a critical link between newcrudeoilproduction in the prolific Delaware Basin and multiple market centers and long-haul pipelines connected to Medallion’s system.   [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,bizwire.c81266802,Regional Business News,"Medallion Announces Binding Open Season for New Delaware Basin Crude Oil Pipeline, Joint Tariff Service and Solicitation of Capacity Turnback"," Medallion Delaware Express, LLC (Delaware Express) and Medallion Pipeline Company, LLC (Medallion) are conducting an open season to solicit binding, long-term commitments to support a new crude oil pipeline system in the Delaware Basin in west Texas, and a new joint transportation service to be provided by Delaware Express and Medallion. Through this binding open season, Delaware Express and Medallion expect to make up to 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) available for Joint Tariff service, with up to 180,000 bpd available to committed shippers at volume incentive rates under long-term transportation agreements (Transportation Services Agreements), providing for either acreage dedications or volume commitments. The proposed Joint Tariff service will provide a critical link between new crude oil production in the prolific Delaware Basin and multiple market centers and long-haul pipelines connected to Medallion’s system.   About the Delaware Express Pipeline   The Delaware Express pipeline system will be a new crude oil gathering and transportation system in Ward, Pecos, Reeves and Crane counties to connect southern Delaware Basin crude oil to downstream pipelines, including Medallion. Subject to the outcome of this open season, Delaware Express will initially construct a 30-mile gathering system and a 63-mile, 16-inch mainline pipeline with an initial capacity of 90,000 bpd, originating in Ward County and extending east to an interconnection with Medallion in Crane County. Depending on the level of capacity subscriptions awarded through the open season, the gathering system and mainline will expand over time through the addition of field lines, gathering lines, pumping station horsepower, drag reducing agents, and/or the looping of all or some portion of the mainline to meet Delaware Express’ contractual obligations under the Transportation Services Agreements and to connect the acreage dedicated through the open season process.   About Medallion Pipeline   The existing Medallion pipeline is a network of approximately 600 miles of 6-inch and larger crude oil pipeline located in Martin, Howard, Mitchell, Midland, Glasscock, Crane, Upton, Reagan and Scurry counties in the Midland Basin. Initially placed in service in October 2014, Medallion has undertaken a series of expansions to meet the increasing needs of producers and marketers in the region. Through the Joint Tariff service, Medallion will receive crude oil from Delaware Express at the interconnection between Delaware Express and Medallion near Medallion’s Crane Hub. Medallion will deliver crude oil transported under the Joint Tariff at multiple hubs that interconnect with long-haul, large-volume pipeline systems for transportation to downstream refinery markets.   Medallion will initially provide the Joint Tariff service through an expansion of its system to be effectuated through the addition of pumping facilities and possibly capacity temporarily or permanently released from existing shippers, as explained below. Capacity additions over the term of the Transportation Services Agreements to meet Medallion’s contractual obligations may be achieved by the addition of new or increased pumping station horsepower, drag reducing agents, the looping of pipeline segments of the Joint Tariff route, and/or capacity turnback, if any.   Medallion Solicitation of Turnback Capacity   Medallion is soliciting requests from existing shippers with effective transportation services agreements along the Joint Tariff route to temporarily or permanently turn back a portion of their capacity. This would potentially defer or reduce the facilities initially required to be constructed by Medallion to provide the Joint Tariff service. The solicitation of turnback capacity is not binding on Medallion, and the turnback of capacity will be determined by Medallion at its sole discretion. Qualified shippers that are interested in potentially turning back capacity must participate in the open season for that purpose.   Open Season Process   The open season begins today, October 18, 2017 and ends at 5:00 pm CDT on November 15, 2017. All bids for the Joint Tariff service and expressions of interest regarding the potential turnback of capacity must be submitted during the open season. Bona fide prospective shippers may obtain copies of the Transportation Services Agreements, as well as the proposed Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Texas Railroad Commission Joint Tariffs by contacting the representative listed below. Prospective shippers must execute a confidentiality agreement prior to delivery of these documents. More information concerning the Joint Tariff service and the binding open season is available on the Medallion website at www.medallionmidstream.com.

They started off buying a hundred barrels of crude oil and got it to a pipeline. Well, today we listen as it arrives at a refinery to be turned into gasoline. Stacey Vanek Smith and Robert Smith were there to meet it.ROBERT SMITH: We pulled to McPherson, Kans., late at night. It is a small town just off the highway. But it has a skyline that looks like Manhattan - towers shooting into the sky all lit up.VINCE BENGSTON: You see the lights way before you see it and start wondering, what's that? I mean everybody that's here - they know what it is. It's home.STACEY VANEK SMITH: Vince Bengston lives in McPherson and works in those bright towers. This is the CHS oil refinery. It's no less impressive in the daylight. It is vast - thousands of pipes and tanks and catwalks. And the refinery is so enormous because it does this amazing thing.R. SMITH: Yes, yes, yes. I have this little bit of our Planet Money oil right here in this bottle. And it looks just like this thick, black liquid. But in fact crude oil is a mixture. Think of it like a petrochemical smoothie.S. SMITH: There are molecules in there that become butane for your lighter, molecules that become diesel.R. SMITH: The refinery unjumbles the hydrocarbons in oil. It sorts like with like all along the way in these pipes and tanks.S. SMITH: And the last bit of this sorting happens in the coker.R. SMITH: The coker.BENGSTON: This is our new coker that came online in February.S. SMITH: The coker is two giant, black cylinders that tower over everything. Essentially, it is a very tall oven.BENGSTON: Realize there is more heat at the bottom of the column than at the top.R. SMITH: So how hot on the bottom and how hot at the top?BENGSTON: Bottom of the column - 840 degrees Fahrenheit - 360 on top.R. SMITH: So you could cook a steak, basically, at the bottom. And the top is more like a cake temperature.BENGSTON: A good sear on a good steak on the bottom, yes.R. SMITH: All these different temperatures separate out the parts of the crude.S. SMITH: The black, tar-like gook stays at the bottom. The gases move to the top. And all the different kinds of petroleum products are sorted out in between.BENGSTON: Natural gas, propane, butane, gasoline, diesel. Some of the sulfur that's removed in other processes goes into fertilizer.R. SMITH: Fertilizer that gets used on the cornfields right around McPherson. And that corn gets fed to pigs. Pigs make ham.S. SMITH: So if we go eat a sandwich in town, we could be eating our oil.BENGSTON: Yes.S. SMITH: Really?BENGSTON: Yes.R. SMITH: Refineries are the reason that oil can be made into everything - our cellphones, clothes, cosmetics, medication, furniture.S. SMITH: Sandwiches.R. SMITH: Sandwiches - but most of the Planet Money oil is getting turned into good, old-fashioned gasoline. Once that happens, it will go via pipeline from the CHS refinery to its final destination, someone's gas tank.S. SMITH: And where's this pipeline going?BENGSTON: Council Bluffs.S. SMITH: Where is that?BENGSTON: Iowa.S. SMITH: Looks like we're going to Iowa.R. SMITH: Iowa - tune into Morning Edition tomorrow to keep following the Planet Money oil pipeline. Robert Smith.S.

We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, impairments , unit-based compensation, (gain) loss on non-cash derivatives, (gain) loss on disposition of assets, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, successful acquisition transaction costs (if any), accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations, non-cash rent and distributions from unconsolidated affiliate investments less payments under onerous performance obligations, non-controlling interest and (income) loss from unconsolidated affiliate investments. We define distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA (defined above), net to the Partnership, less interest expense (excluding amortization of the EnLink Oklahoma T.O. acquisition installment payable discount), litigation settlement adjustment, adjustments for the redeemable non-controlling interest, interest rate swaps, current income taxes and other non-distributable cash flows, accrued cash distributions on Series B Preferred Units and Series C Preferred Units paid or expected to be paid, and maintenance capital expenditures, excluding maintenance capital expenditures that were contributed by other entities and relate to the non-controlling interest share of our consolidated entities. The General Partner's cash available for distribution is defined as net income (loss) of the General Partner less the net income (loss) attributable to the Partnership, which is consolidated into the General Partner's net income (loss), plus the General Partner's (i) share of distributions from the Partnership, (ii) share of EnLink Oklahoma T.O.'s non-cash expenses, (iii) deferred income tax expense (benefit), (iv) corporate goodwill impairment, if any, and (v) successful acquisition transaction costs, if any, less the General Partner's interest in maintenance capital expenditures of EnLink Oklahoma T.O., and less third-party non-controlling interest share of the Partnership's net income (loss) from consolidated affiliates.The Partnership's distribution coverage is calculated by dividing distributable cash flow by distributions declared to the General Partner and the common unitholders. The General Partner's distribution coverage is calculated by dividing cash available for distribution by distributions declared by the General Partner.Growth capital expenditures generally include capital expenditures made for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our asset base, operating income or operating capacity over the long-term. Maintenance capital expenditures generally include capital expenditures made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain the existing operating capacity of the assets and to extend their useful lives.The Partnership and General Partner believe these measures are useful to investors because they may provide users of this financial information with meaningful comparisons between current results and previously-reported results and a meaningful measure of each of the Partnership's and the General Partner's cash flow after it has satisfied the capital and related requirements of its operations. In addition, adjusted EBITDA achievement is a primary metric used in the Partnership's credit facility and short-term incentive program for compensating its employees.Segment profit (loss) is defined as operating income (loss) plus general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, (gain) loss on disposition of assets, impairments and (gain) loss on litigation settlement. Segment profit (loss) includes non-cash compensation expenses reflected in operating expenses. See ""Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 15 – Segment Information"" in ENLK's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and, when available, ""Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 11—Segment Information"" in ENLK's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018, for further information about segment profit (loss)Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow, and cash available for distribution, as defined above, are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. They should not be considered in isolation or as an indicator of the Partnership's and the General Partner's performance. Furthermore, they should not be seen as a substitute for metrics prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the following tables. See ENLK's and ENLC's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for more information.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

Avenger is expected to significantly expand EnLink's crude oil gathering operations in the area.Avenger exemplifies EnLink's proven approach of utilizing existing platforms to grow and expand service offerings with projects anchored by strong, active producers. EnLink successfully implemented this multi-commodity strategy in top U.S. basins like Central Oklahoma and the Midland Basin.The project is anchored by a 10-year contract with Devon Energy Corp. and is supported by dedications from Devon's Todd (Eddy and Lea Counties, New Mexico) and Potato Basin (Eddy County, New Mexico) development areas. Devon previously announced plans to direct a significant portion of its capital budget into Delaware Basin development.""EnLink has an established natural gas footprint in the Delaware Basin, and Avenger expands our service offerings by leveraging our crude gathering expertise to better serve our customers,"" said Michael J. Garberding, EnLink President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Our strong, long-term commercial relationship with Devon remains firmly in place, and today's announcement demonstrates our joint commitment to ongoing success together in several regions, from North Texas to Central Oklahoma and now in the Delaware Basin. Avenger is another high-quality project that evidences the success of EnLink's 'Right Places, Right Partners, Right Plan' business model.""The Partnership plans to invest approximately $35 million to $40 million of capital expenditures in the development of Avenger in 2018. These additional capital expenditures are incremental to the previously issued 2018 capital expenditures outlook for the Partnership's crude and condensate segment. Further capital expenditures are expected in future years as Devon continues to develop its acreage in the region. Initial operations are expected to commence during the third quarter of 2018, and full-service operations are expected to commence during the first quarter of 2019.""Avenger is the third crude oil gathering platform in a high-growth basin that EnLink has announced over the last two years,"" Garberding said.

The report projects oil product prices, margins, and spreads to 2025.   This refined products pricing model uses a time-tested approach of linking physical market fundamentals to the microeconomics-based price-setting mechanisms that explain and predict pricing behavior. These crude and products price scenarios are paramount to understanding actual market behavior and to predicting future market outcomes.   Backed by Fundamentals  We generate price scenarios based on oil market fundamentals such as crude supply, product demand, and refinery utilization. Forecasts can be provided based on analyst fundamentals or using your specific assumptions.  Based on Refining Microeconomics  Leverage our view on market fundamentals to define where each product falls on a supply or demand curve.  Test Drive Your Own Assumptions  This report includes 30 major spot traded product grades in three regional hubs, 11 major regional crude grades on a fob and delivery basis as well as refining margins and spreads.  Key Topics Covered:   1. Market Overview   Review of changes in market fundamentals (product balances, refinery utilization, and crude and product trade flows) and their resulting impact on which mechanisms have been setting price and margin conditions.  How have prices and margins changed monthly over the last several years? What price-setting mechanism behavior explains this? What change in fundamentals drove this behavior?  2. Market Outlook   Presentation of a proprietary outlook for market fundamentals (crude and other feedstock supply, product demand, refinery capacity changes) and the impact they will have on key price-setting mechanisms and resulting prices and margins.  How will market fundamentals evolve? How will this affect price-setting mechanisms? What prices and margins will result?  3. Sensitivity Cases   Six market scenarios in addition to our reference case, incorporating sensitivities for all key price-setting mechanisms and the resulting impact on prices and margins.  Given uncertainty in fundamentals, what are potential alternative outcomes for price-setting mechanisms? What will be the resulting prices and margins? What would you have to believe for this outcome to occur?

Facebook (FB) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg faces a second day of congressional testimony in Washington. Tesla (TSLA) received an analyst price target cut. Netflix (NFLX) received two price target increases.Among major indexes, the Dow Jones industrial average dumped 0.8% at the starting bell, while the S&P 500 shed 0.6%.

Mattel (MAT) posted the strongest early move among Nasdaq 100 stocks -- up nearly 4% after an analyst upgrade. Netflix (NFLX) surged after two analysts raised price targets ahead of the company's earnings release next week.On Tuesday, the market's powerful rally left the Dow, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq with gains in five of the past six sessions. That has led to an improving market status as the three indexes climb off a test of support at their 200-day moving averages. Markets remain volatile and quick to turn on a headline. In addition, all three benchmark indexes face an upcoming test of resistance at their 50-day moving averages. The Dow Jones ended Tuesday 1% below its 50-day line. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 were each 2% below that level.The Trump administration on Wednesday pressed allies to support military action vs. Syria, news reports said. The effort is in response to a chemicals weapons attack reported Saturday in Syria. That attack was attributed to state forces led by the country's embattled president, Bashar al-Assad. Both the U.S. and France had by early Wednesday reportedly positioned ships armed with cruise missiles in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. A tweet from President Trump warned Russia of the pending missile attack in Syria, where the Kremlin maintains a broad military stance in support of al-Assad.Crude oil price gains continued, with West Texas Intermediate up 0.8% -- to above $66 per barrel early Wednesday.

Netflix shares are in the fifth week of a shallow consolidation.Tesla skidded 1.5% after a Goldman Sachs note lowered its price target to 195, from 205 -- 36% below the stock's closing price Tuesday. The note projected the company would find itself forced to go to markets for additional capital before the end of the year. That would counter the guidance recently offered by company chief, Elon Musk. Musk tweeted for investors to ""Place your bets"" following the note's release.

But almost 75% of the group's 26 oil stocks are companies based outside of the U.S.Among those is Ecopetrol (EC), a Colombian-based producer listed on IBD's Global Leaders lineup. The integrated group also includes international heavyweights such as BP (BP), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Suncor (SU). All of those oil stocks are in bases. Two of them have earnings due early in the week.Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29Get premium stock lists, pass or fail stock ratings and more. Start HereCrude oil price gains have helped boost Ecopetrol shares 49% since the start of the year. Company regulatory filings say it has been evolving ""from a wholly state-owned entity to a mixed-economy company with private capital"" since going public in the U.S. in 2008. At the end of 2017, the Colombian government owned 88.49% of the company's voting capital stock.Analysts expect Ecopetrol to report a 140% EPS gain and a 31% revenue increase in its quarterly results due May 9.Britain's BP on Friday traded narrowly below a 44.72 buy point in 11-week cup base.The company's financial performance has been up-and-down for the past five quarters, which followed six years of earnings declines triggered by the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010.Analyst consensus expects recent crude oil price gains to help power EPS to a 48% gain on a 22% rise in revenue when the company reports early Tuesday.Netherlands-based Royal Dutch Shell is just below a 72.53 buy point in 12-week cup base. On Thursday, the company reported earnings up 40% and a 24% rise in revenue. Earnings growth stopped a penny short of analyst estimates, and management left investors hanging as to when it would launch a planned $25 billion buy back initiative.Canadian oil sands producer Suncor has been toying with 38.49 buy point in 13-week cup base pattern. Consensus views call for a 12% EPS decline in its report late Tuesday, as it runs up against tough comparisons following five quarters of triple-digit or better earnings growth.RELATED:Chevron Flunked The Q4 Test, But Now Faces A Fresh TestTop-Performing Dow Titan Chevron Reaps The Benefits of RestructuringFour Earnings Due From Hot Energy Sector, Including These 2 Dow Jones GiantsConocoPhillips Crushes Earnings Views Ahead Of Exxon, Chevron ResultsOil Prices Rise Despite Surprise U.S. Stockpile Gain; Production UpGraph: https://research.investors.com/ibdchartswp.aspx?cht=pvc&type=daily&symbol=BPGraph: https://research.investors.com/ibdchartswp.aspx?cht=pvc&type=weekly&symbol=RDSABy ALAN R.

This level represents an increase of 464,000 b/d over 2016 output. Production of U.S. crude oil has increased significantly over the last decade due to improved access to tight rock formations via horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing.This increase has led the EIA to project that crude oil production will continue to grow in 2018 and 2019, averaging 10.7 million b/d and 11.3 million b/d, respectively. In the United States, Texas continues to produce more crude oil than any other state or region. They also led production from 1970-1988, 1989-1998 and since 2012. The 2017 annual production increase by Texas of nearly 300,000 b/d was more than all other states and the Federal Gulf of Mexico combined.New Mexico was the state with the second-largest growth in 2017, surpassing California and Alaska to become the third-largest crude oil-producing state (behind Texas and the Gulf) in the second half of 2017, although it produced less than those areas on an annual basis. In the Federal Gulf of Mexico, new projects and expansions that started in 2016 ramped up production in 2017. The Federal Gulf of Mexico was the second-largest producing region in 2017.Production levels in Colorado, Oklahoma, and North Dakota each grew by more than 30,000 b/d from 2016 to 2017. Their growth helped offset California's production decline of 34,000 b/d, the state's third consecutive annual drop in production. 1 http://www.bicmagazine.com/industry-segments/drilling-exploration-subsection/u-s-production-of-crude-oil-grew-5-in-2017-likely-leading-to/By Jeff ReinkeCopyright of ThomasNet News is the property of Thomas Publishing Company LLC and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

[ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,bizwire.c82195839,Regional Business News,Harvest Pipeline Company and Vitol Inc. Agree to Pursue Development of a State of the Art Crude Oil Terminal in the Port of Corpus Christi," In response to increased demand for crude transportation from South Texas and the Permian Basin, Harvest Pipeline Company (an affiliate of Hilcorp Energy Company) and Vitol Inc. have established an agreement to explore joint development of a state of the art crude oil terminal to be located in the Port of Corpus Christi.   “The agreement between Harvest Pipeline Company and Vitol is an extraordinary opportunity to help satisfy the growing need for export capacity along the Texas Gulf Coast,” said Sean Kolassa, President Harvest Pipeline Company. “We are excited for the project to begin moving forward.”   This project will complement Harvest’s existing South Texas business by providing Eagle Ford barrels a new terminal connection from the Harvest Midway junction. In addition, this concept will provide a new waterborne outlet for the growing number of Permian barrels that are seeking access to international markets. As more barrels flow to Corpus Christi from the Permian Basin, additional storage will be developed at the emerging Midway hub.   “Crude demand, particularly in emerging markets, continues to grow and U.S. shale has an important role to play in satisfying this demand. Our new pipeline and terminal will facilitate the efficient delivery of U.S. crude to global markets, thereby increasing marketing opportunities and optimizing value for U.S. producers,” said Mark Couling head of Crude Oil for Vitol.   The parties have reached agreement with the Port of Corpus Christi for the location of the terminal development and dock access. In addition, the parties are reviewing the option of constructing a private dock for the parties’ sole use at the oil terminal facility. Barrels will have access to the terminal via a new 16-inch lateral pipeline.   About Harvest   Harvest Pipeline Company is a privately held midstream service provider that operates various crude oil and natural gas gathering, storage, transportation, treatment and terminalling assets on behalf of its affiliates across the United States.   About Vitol   Vitol is an energy and commodities company; its primary business is the trading and distribution of energy products globally – it trades over seven million barrels per day of crude oil and products and, at any time, has 250 ships transporting its cargoes.   Vitol’s clients include national oil companies, multinationals, leading industrial and chemical companies and the world’s largest airlines. Founded in Rotterdam in 1966, today Vitol serves clients from some 40 offices worldwide and is invested in energy assets globally including: circa 18mm3 of storage across six continents, 480kbpd of refining capacity and 5,000 service stations across Africa, Australia, Eurasia and in Northwest Europe.

Iran, the world's fifth largest oil producer, exported 2.48 million barrels per day in April.Crude oil prices received an added boost Wednesday morning, after the Energy Information Administration reported a 2.2-million-barrel draw on U.S. oil stockpiles last week vs. expectations for a build of 160,000 barrels.The highest flying oil name among S&P 500 stocks, Occidental Petroleum (OXY) snapped more than 5% higher.

Smart Sand (SND), Emerge Energy Services (EMES) and Fairmount Santrol (FMSA) have been among the fastest movers, with Hi-Crush (HCLP) and U.S. Silica (SLCA) occupying strong positions in the industry.",1270,127422832,Regional Business News,"Crude Oil Price, Energy Stocks Rally; Will A Fracking Sand Boom Follow?","Industry SnapshotCrude oil prices rebounding to three-year highs have drawn investors back to energy stocks, driving energy sector groups to six of the 10 largest moves among industries over the past four weeks.X Some of the fastest moving energy-sector names have been companies that mine sand, rather than produce oil. Smart Sand (SND), Emerge Energy Services (EMES) and Fairmount Santrol (FMSA) have been among the fastest movers, with Hi-Crush (HCLP) and U.S. Silica (SLCA) occupying controlling positions in the industry.The revolution in shale gas and oil production has altered the global energy calculus in less than a decade. It's a revolution that depends heavily upon sand as a raw material. Hydraulic fracturing, the process of pressuring up wells until the surrounding rock reservoirs collapse and surrender their oil, requires sand to prop open channels in the ruptured stone through which oil and gas flow to the well.Not to be confused with sand from the beach, frac sand is quartz-based, with rounded grains and very high fracture strength. As the length of horizontal well stages becomes longer, more and more sand is being used.Producers are continually tinkering with the fracking recipe, altering the cocktail of fracking fluids used based on local geology and the industry's learning curve. Over the past two years, the industry has found rising success using 'slickwater' fracs to coax larger amounts of petroleum products from each well.These fracs require much larger amounts of water and sand, compared to the once -preferred gel fracking method. As a result, and so long as oil prices hold, the U.S. shale oil industry is looking at sharp increases in demand for fracking sand.At the same time, a massive influx of new sand supply from Texas could place downward pressure on prices across the industry just after markets began to recover.Sonny Randhawa, a director at Seaport Global Securities, expects frac sand demand to increase to 100 million tons in 2018 and 115 million tons in 2019, up from 82 million tons in 2017.But not all sand is created equal. Producers sift out various grades according to size. The most in-demand currently is 100 mesh, which is the finest and typically has a crush strength of 10,000 to 13,000 pounds per square inch -- perfect for slickwater fracs. The next step up is 40/70, which has a similar crush strength, but is slightly more coarse, meaning 90% of the product will pass through a No. 40 mesh size, but not through a 70 mesh.This is a turnaround from 2014, where coarser 20/40 sand was the most sought after as exploration and production companies used gels and other more viscous chemicals that could carry thicker, heavier sands. Back then, 100 mesh was just used to reclaim land after drilling.""The E&Ps (oil exploration and production companies) are finicky and can change sand preferences on a dime,"" said Will Thompson, Barclays VP of equity research, oilfield services and equipment.High-quality northern white sand shipped out of Wisconsin has long been an industry favorite. But companies are now looking at brown sand produced by Texas mines nearer the bustling Permian Basin. The sand has a number of drawbacks vs. Wisconsin white, but the close proximity of the mines helps cut shipping expenses, which can account for 65% of frac sand costs, according to Randhawa.Frac sand was expected to enter ""bullish territory in 2017,"" according to a May IHS Markit report, with demand passing peak 2014 levels. IHS expected producers in the Permian to generate 37% of total demand, twice as much as the area required in 2014.Investors have remained cautious, concerned by expectations that as much as 60 million tons of Texas-based frac sand could come online in 2018-2019, Thompson said. That could displace the northern white sand to the Eagle Ford, Bakken and other basins, a recipe for a ""supply shock"" that some analysts suggest could hit stocks in 2019 and 2020.While the prospects for sand are promising through 2018, the material is a major expense, and production companies are constantly experimenting with new techniques and in search of ways to reduce costs.""E&Ps are all under pressure to improve returns,"" Thompson said. So they will increasingly focus on the ""net present value of (each) well,"" rather than prioritizing a well's output over its cost.Thompson is cautious about the oilfield service industry as a whole, favoring diversified, large cap oilfield service providers like Halliburton (HAL). He points to U.S. Silica as the strongest player in the sand industry because of its diversification into industrial markets.Frac sand companies are part of the Chemicals-Specialty group, which ranked No. 94 on Thursday, a mid-grade ranking among the 197 industries tracked by IBD. The group has posted a soft, 2.5% gain so far this year.But within the group, sand producer Emerge Energy has gained 26% since the start of the year. Smart Sand is up almost 15% in a fifth straight monthly gain. Fairmont Santrol has a 12% advance, while Hi-Crush is up nearly 10%.All four are expected to post triple-digit earnings gains in 2018.Hi-Crush acquired Permian Basin Sand in February, and U.S. Silica announced in September plans to open a second West Texas sand mine, giving them a first mover advantage in the market for the lower quality brown sand, said Lucas Pipes, an analyst at FBR.""They have a good mix of being in the right place and right time with the right assets, and not being overextended financially,"" he said.But sand miners typically face low barriers of entry, so start-ups can easily enter the market. Among those, Atlas Sand has jumped in among the early ""Permian sand"" pure plays. It began construction on the first of two west Texas plants in December, and plans to produce 24 million tons of Permian sand per year by 2020 -2021.It will produce 40/70 and 100 mesh size product, in direct competition to the established sand providers.Randhawa also has a bullish view on the space, with buy ratings across the board on Fairmount Santrol, Hi-Crush, U.S. Silica, Smart Sand and Emerge Energy Services.""Just the threat of (more sand) coming online paralyzes anyone else from coming on,"" Randhawa said. ""You can't just dip a toe in the market.""The 'headline risk' of oversupply has been priced in, he says, and the upstart Permian miners have a lot of hurdles to overcome -- access to water, truck congestion, environmental concerns, to name a few -- not to mention producers will likely mine less sand than expected.""Companies (in the sand space) are trading at ridiculously low multiples,"" he said. ""They are generating tons of cash, rewarding shareholders, and buying back stock.""Randhawa also pointed to Atlas, run by oil tycoon Bud Brigham, as a unique case. Brigham has sold two energy companies in recent years, the first to Diamondback Energy (FANG) and another to Norway's Statoil (STO).""He's in the energy business so he knows people,"" Randhawa said of Brigham. ""There are no bankers getting into the business, just other energy players.""Right now, there is still no Permian sand pure play public company and there might not be one in the near future.Private companies ""need to get funding and get all their ducks in order and see if they even want to go public,"" Pipes said.Also, unlike other energy service industries, sand is still in its infancy with ""multiple players, so it's still very fragmented. We will see more and more consolidation,"" Randhawa said.Last month, Fairmount Santrol and Belgium's privately held Unimin agreed to merge. And Fairmont, Hi-Crush, U.S. Silica and Smart Sand are all expected to be looking to snap up smaller, regional operations.Another concern: environmental regulations. While the Trump Administration has been lifting restrictions on oil and gas production, Texas is a far cry from the Wild West.Some of the region's potential sand mine sites are reportedly home to high concentrations of rare dune sagebrush lizards. Randhawa said environmental groups have threatened to fast-track the lizard onto the endangered species list if companies don't agree to monitor populations and habitat. The move could make it more difficult to get mining approvals in those areas.YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN:OPEC Raises 2018 U.S. Oil Production Forecast As Higher Prices Spur ActivityDividend Hikes, Largest IPO Ever Lead 5 Oil Stories To Watch This YearEnergy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalTop Solar Stocks Hit Highs Ahead of Trump Verdict On China TariffsOil Pops Above $57 Amid Conflicting Signals On GlutBy  @IBD_GRich GILLIAN RICH, Facebook Copyright of Investors Business Daily is the property of Investor's Business Daily and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

They are the first assessments by any international price reporting agency to be based on actual transactions for crude delivered to China.China is the world's largest crude oil importer, and around a third of its imports end up in Shandong province, home to 3.6mn b/d of independent refining capacity. China's central government blocked independent refiners from the seaborne market, until its mid-2015 reforms gave them access to imports. Since then, demand from China's independent sector has grown rapidly, with over 1mn b/d of a diverse range of crude grades delivered to the province on a spot basis.The new Argus assessments track 300,000-400,000 b/d of trade in the most liquid grades to ports around the city of Qingdao — Russian ESPO Blend, Brazilian Lula, and Congolese Djeno.Shandong is the main destination for the more than 600,000 b/d of ESPO Blend that Russia exports from the Pacific coast port of Kozmino. Argus already produces a price assessment at the export terminal, and the new delivered China assessment will allow the market to track prices from sale to purchase.China is also the largest, single destination for Brazil's fast-growing crude exports of 950,000 b/d, for which no independently assessed price reference has existed until now. China is the main destination for west African crude exports, and Argus' new price assessments will bring transparency to refiner demand as cargoes begin trading at their point of origin.These assessments build on more than a decade of Argus' on-the-ground analysis of supply, demand and market trends in China and a 50-year history in energy price reporting.""Providing visibility into this opaque market will allow trade between China and Brazil, Russia and west Africa to develop from spot into term contracts, where a reliable and acceptable price reference is vital,"" Argus Media chairman and chief executive Adrian Binks said.Prices will be available in the Argus Crude daily market reporting service and Argus China Petroleum monthly service.About Argus MediaArgus is an independent media organisation with almost 900 staff.

Brent also rose by 5.9 percent, breaking a three-week decline in prices.The surge in oil prices also indicates that the fundamental outlook has turned positive. The expected shortage of Iranian oil supplies has led to the recent price depression, as well as the fallout of the trade war, which led to halting of oil purchase by Unipec for two months.Iran is currently ranked third in the OPEC group, with shipments of 2.5 million barrels per day of crude and condensate. In terms of global consumption, it supplies 2.5 percent of oil.

[ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,bizwire.c81571204,Regional Business News,"Crude Oil Flow Improvers Market Analysis By Product, And Segment Forecasts, 2014 - 2025 - Research and Markets"," The ""Crude Oil Flow Improvers Market Analysis By Product, And Segment Forecasts, 2014 - 2025"" report has been added to Research and Markets' offering.   The global crude oil flow improvers market is expected to reach USD 2.03 billion by 2025   The market is estimated to grow significantly over the forecast period owing to shale revolution positively affecting the COFI market. Despite several existing rigs being decommissioned over the last few years, the industry has witnessed an increase in the overall petroleum production. This has given an impetus to the need for utilization of these chemicals in the upstream extraction sector.   The existence and expansion of product pipelines have encouraged the utilization of these products to improve the productivity, minimize the throughput time and eliminate the bottlenecks during the various operations across the oil and gas value chain.   Asphaltene inhibitors are anticipated to be the fastest growing segment over the upcoming years and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.3% from 2017 to 2025. These products help to reduce the precipitation of asphaltenes, preserve the asset integrity of the flow lines and optimize the operations over the forecast period. The utility of these chemicals is predominant in the extraction and pipeline segments. The problems associated with the extraction and transportation of asphaltenic crude include pipeline deposition and wellbore plugging. These unwanted bottlenecks result in the increase in the demand for these products globally.   Paraffin inhibitors is expected to be the largest product segment. Paraffin content in crude oil can damage transport equipment. It helps in eradicating the effects of wax deposition during petroleum extraction, refining, and transportation.   Major companies actively operating in the industry in the present scenario would include BASF, Halliburton, Schlumberger, Nalco, and Baker Huges.   Key Topics Covered:   Chapter 1.

0,Morning Edition (NPR). 01/19/2016.,Transcript,,,,6XN201601191119,Newspaper Source,Alaska Faces Budget Deficit As Crude Oil Prices Slide.,"RENEE MONTAGNE: For decades, Alaska has relied on oil to pay its bills. Now that the price of crude has plunged to prices not seen since the early 2000s, Alaska is facing a $3.5 billion deficit - that's two-thirds of the state's budget. As Alaska Public Media's Rachel Waldholz reports, lawmakers gathering in Juneau today face some unpopular choices - like charging Alaskans an income tax.RACHEL WALDHOLZ: To understand why Alaska has a budget problem, stop by any gas station. In Anchorage, gas sells for $2.30 a gallon. A year and a half ago, people here were shelling out more than $4 a gallon. And that's the problem. Tour guide Lynn Jablonski stopped to fill up her car.LYNN JABLONSKI: It's a mixed feeling, right? Because it's a great thing when I look at my credit card bill, but it's not so good for the state that oil prices are so low.WALDHOLZ: As crude price have dropped, the state's state budget has tanked, so America's most oil-dependent state is trying to figure out what to do. Alaska always knew this day would come. When companies struck oil in Prudhoe Bay in 1968, leaders worried how to manage the windfall.JAY HAMMOND: You've got to remove the money, put it behind a rope where you cannot utilize it for flamboyant expenditure.WALDHOLZ: That was Jay Hammond, Alaska's governor, speaking in 1980. Hammond helped create the Permanent Fund - call it Alaska's retirement account. Each year, a share of oil money is set aside, and the fund has grown to about $50 billion. And the state isn't allowed to touch it - just the earnings. Hammond saw it as a source of income for when oil ran out. In the last 40 years, those earnings have been used for pretty much just one thing - everyone in the state receives an annual share. Last year's check was more $2,000. If the state wants to use the fund's earnings to cover the deficit, it will reduce that dividend. Back at the gas station, Dave Neibert filled up his tank. He puts his daughter's check each year into a college fund.DAVE NEIBERT: I'm a long-term Alaskan - been here my whole life. And I've gotten every one of the Permanent Fund checks. So I think they can look elsewhere.WALDHOLZ: There aren't many places to look. Alaska remains the only state without either an income or a sales tax. Even if it had both, the tax base isn't big enough - only about 740,000 people live here. With oil down, earnings on the state savings are now the single largest source of income. Alaska Governor Bill Walker wants to turn those savings into a kind of endowment to generate a fixed income.BILL WALKER: It basically puts Alaska on an allowance, and so we stop making our day-to-day decisions in government based upon the price of oil.WALDHOLZ: The plan wouldn't solve all the budget problems, so Walker has proposed new taxes, including the first income tax since 1980. That's a tall order any time, and this is an election year. The legislature's Republican majority opposes new taxes and wants deep cuts first. Democrats, like State Senator Bill Wielechowski, argue that before the state goes after Alaskans' PFD - or Permanent Fund Dividend - it should demand more of its biggest industry.BILL WIELECHOWSKI: So I have a hard time going back to my constituents and saying, yeah, I'm sorry, we've got to take your PFD so I can continue giving tax credits to the largest, wealthiest corporations in the history of the world. That's not going to fly in my district.WALDHOLZ: It's not clear it will fly anywhere. But if it does, the last frontier could find its feet a little less tied to the price at the pump.

The Energy Ministry has given instructions to work out measures to support the refining industry. One calls for introduction of a so-called negative or reverse excise tax on crude oil that a company supplies to its own refineries in Russia to produce gasoline and aviation kerosene. The size of the excise will depend on the production volume of these fuel types.The scheme hasn't been worked out yet. So far, the Energy Ministry has only been instructed to prepare a report for the government on measures to support the oil refining sector by January 15, which will contain the main outlines for introducing a negative excise tax.The Finance Ministry previously examined options for introducing a negative excise tax on crude oil as export duties on crude oil are removed.Jh nb(Our editorial staff can be reached at eng.editors@interfax.ru)Copyright (c) 2017 Interfax.

Current CIA Director Mike Pompeo will replace him.""Pompeo is more likely to support sanctions against Iran than Tillerson was,"" said James Williams, an economist at energy consultant WTRG. ""One of the reasons why Trump got rid of Tillerson was that Tillerson wasn't nearly as aggressive as Trump on the issues.""Williams said sanctions with Iran would reduce Iranian oil production, noting that oil hit $100 a barrel when the Obama administration levied sanctions on Iran. While oil won't hit $100 this time, he said prices will still go higher.The ongoing unrest in Venezuela is also rattling the oil market, according to Williams.On Monday, Trump signed an order outlawing U.S. companies and citizens from using Venezuela's new cryptocurrency, the Petro, saying it's an ""attempt to circumvent U.S. sanctions.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalSaudi Crown Prince Poised To Go On $35 Billion U.S. Shopping SpreeOPEC, Russia May Be Trapped By Flood Of Oil From U.S. Shale ProducersBy GILLIAN RICHCopyright of Investors Business Daily is the property of Investor's Business Daily and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

Prices sank after a fracking boom in the U.S. and weaker demand in China led to an oil glut.But more oil companies have ramped up production as the oil market rebounds from an oversupply that sank prices in 2014 and, in turn, financial results.Analysts expect the sector's drag on the S&P 500 to have fully ended in the fourth quarter. The U.S.' crude supply fell for the fifth straight week, government data showed on Wednesday. OPEC last week reached an agreement to cut and cap production, but Iran has sought to raise output.RELATED:OPEC Oil Production Pact May Last A Year As Key Discussions To StartRoyal Dutch Shell Leads Big-Oil Dividend Plays In BasesThe U.S. oil rig count rose for the 14th in the last 15 weeks.

Crude in American tanks and terminals slipped last week to the lowest since February 2015 while inventories at the nation's biggest storage hub also swung lower, according to government data. Demand for stored supplies in the world's biggest economy has been robust at a time of year when it's usually weak because of refinery repairs, all against the backdrop of OPEC production curbs.""Demand is outpacing supply,"" Brian Kessens, who helps manage $16 billion in energy assets at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC, said by telephone. ""The OPEC curtailments are helping and their compliance has been relatively strong.""Oil hit the highest levels since 2014 in New York amid shrinking supplies in the U.S. and a united front by major oil producers including the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. Meanwhile, Russia's second-biggest crude producer expects worldwide supply and demand to balance out by April, Lukoil PJSC billionaire CEO Vagit Alekperov said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.West Texas Intermediate for March delivery jumped $1.14 to settle at $65.61 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest level since December 2014. Total volume traded was about 52% above the 100-day average.Brent for March settlement rose 57 cents to end the session at $70.53 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $4.92 to WTI.Some traders had been bracing for inventories to move in the opposite direction and show an increase after the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute was said to have suggested such an outcome in its Tuesday evening report. The API typically discloses its weekly estimates a day before the U.S. Energy Information Administration releases its tally.This is ""somewhat of a relief rally in a way because it was another draw, as opposed to a big build,"" said Joseph Bozoyan, a portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management LLC in Boston.The Energy Information Administration on Wednesday said U.S. crude production rose for a second consecutive week to 9.88 million barrels a day. Oil inventories at the key Cushing, Oklahoma, pipeline hub fell to the lowest level since January 2015, while gasoline stockpiles climbed for an 11th week and distillate stockpiles also increased, according to the government.""What the U.S. refinery complex is seeing is really high demand for gasoline and diesel worldwide,"" Kessens, said. The arbitrage ""gives the U.S. an incentive to export refined products.""The price of crude oil topped $65 on the latest inventory report.

This is Inola High School  Mondays. No school here due to budget cuts. Kent Holbrook is the  superintendent.KENT HOLBROOK: Not in my worst dream did I ever figure that I would be  taking my district to a four-day school week.MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: He says his district outside Tulsa has lost four hundred  thousand dollars in state funding over the last year. The choice was cut  teachers or switch to four days with an extra hour.KENT HOLBROOK: When I start weighing out, what`s going to do more damage to  these students? Is it going to be put thirty, thirty-five first-graders in  a class, or change the hours in a week? The decision was actually pretty  easy.MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: It`s almost the lesser of two evils.KENT HOLBROOK: That where we`re at.MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: Lawmakers blame a seventy-percent drop in oil and gas  prices since 2014. This year the state faced a 1.3-billion-dollar deficit  and cut thirty-four million dollars in education funding. But critics say  that`s in part due to years of giving tax breaks to oil companies, rates as  low as one percent during the boom, while the going rate in North Dakota  was 11.5.AUDRA CORNETT: So you`re going to ease--MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: Nearly a third of Oklahoma`s school districts in mostly  poor, rural areas, have had to shorten the school week.AUDRA CORNETT: Knowing that we don`t have enough money to keep the lights  on and the buses running, it-- I mean, it`s just an outrage.MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: Audra Cornett has two children in Inola schools.

They asked the case be thrown out. The  judge has not ruled.There is a first on Glamour`s list of Women of the Year. It`s a man.

Three such factories were sealed and 20,000-litre crude was recovered, said Gagandeep Singla, superintendent of police, Barmer. The police also seized one more tanker involved in oil theft and arrested two prime accused in the case.     Earlier, the police had seized two factories in Barmer and recovered 46,000-litre crude.     Giving details of the latest disclosures, Singla said that a special team, led by sub-inspector Omprakash Bishnoi and assistant sub-inspector Pannaram, investigating the oil scam got a tip-off that crude stolen from Barmer was being supplied to factories in nearby Jalore district. The information was passed to the Jalore police, which formed three teams to locate the factories. Later, a police team from Barmer joined the Jalore police and raided the three factories, one in Sanchore and two in Siwada.     According to the police, when they raided a factory at Bidhani village in Sanchore, they found 20,000-litre crude. ""Collected sample has been sent to the Cairn laboratory and after getting the report further action will be taken,"" Singla said. The factory was owned by Manju Construction Company.     Later, a police team raided another factory owned by Kuldeep Transport Company in Siwada. Apart from recovering crude oil from an underground tank, a white colour chemical was also seized from the factory.     Police suspect the accused used the chemical for making diesel.     The police also seized one more factory on Chitalwana Road in Siwada suspecting that the accused stored stolen crude oil there.     Following a tip-off, a police team, led by deputy SP Omprakash Ujjawal, also arrested two prime accused, Panacharam Bishnoi and Dholaram Bishnoi, from the Rageshwari police station area.

0,"San Diego Union-Tribune, The (CA). 06/21/2017.",Article,,,,2W6845054798,Newspaper Source,Falling price of crude oil equals cheaper gasoline,"Rob Nikolewski     June 21--If you have noticed that prices at the gas station seem a little bit lower this month, you're not imagining things.     The battle between OPEC and U.S. shale oil drillers has led to another slump in the price of crude and, as a result, the price of gasoline has been on the decline, even as California's summer driving season goes into full swing.     Gas prices in the state have dropped for four consecutive weeks, according to numbers compiled by the U.S. Energy Information, and on Monday the average price of regular gasoline fell below $3 a gallon.     Nationally, the price of regular has dropped nearly 10 cents a gallon in the last two weeks, to $2.32 on Monday.     And David Hackett, president of Stillwater Associates, a transportation energy consulting company in Irvine, thinks the chances are good that the low-price environment will stick around for the next couple of months.     ""There's more room for gas prices to come down,"" Hackett said.     That's good news for California drivers, who as late as April 2014 paid an average of $4.25 a gallon for regular gas. Prices run higher in California than most states due to the state's boutique fuel blend requirements, as well as taxes and environmental mandates.     Since gasoline comes from oil, the price of crude affects prices at the pump, and oil has been on a losing streak of late.     On Wednesday, the price of West Texas Intermediate -- the benchmark price for crude in the U.S. -- dropped 98 cents to $42.53 a barrel, the lowest level in 10 months and more than 20 percent lower from where it stood in February.     That's not where the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel want prices. Less than a month ago, OPEC agreed to extend production restrictions in the hopes of boosting oil prices. But after a very fleeting rally, prices have nose-dived.     In what has developed into a familiar pattern, U.S. producers have more than made up for reductions in supply. Using techniques such as hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and horizontal drilling, companies have ramped up production in shale oil formations such as the Permian Basin in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico.     Oil inventories have remained high and U.S. refineries averaged a record-high 17.7 million barrels per day last month, with utilization rates reaching 95 percent.     ""We're aflush with oil and gasoline right now,"" said Brian Youngberg, senior energy analyst for St. Louis-based Edward Jones. ""Not just here in the U.S. but globally.""     Hackett said a power outage in early May at the Valero refinery in the Bay Area caused gasoline prices in California to tick up last month, but the problem has been cleared up, adding another factor for lower gasoline prices.     As a rule of thumb, changes in oil prices take about six weeks to be fully absorbed into the price of retail gasoline so, with the current slump continuing, Hackett thinks motorists can expect to see lower prices well into the rest of the summer.     ""I wouldn't be at all surprised if (the price of oil) goes back down and tests the recent lows of around $27 (a barrel),"" Hackett said. ""That's entirely possible.""     As recently as three years ago, the price of global crude exceeded $100 a barrel. But rapidly rising production in North America put downward pressure on prices and in November 2014 OPEC refused to cut production.     Though OPEC ministers denied it, the move was widely interpreted as a way to oust U.S. shale producers. Prices around the globe plummeted.     Although more than 200 U.S. producers and oilfield-service companies have filed for bankruptcy since the start of 2015, those who have survived had proven to be remarkably resilient, finding ways to reduce costs so that many of them can make money with oil at $50 a barrel.     Motorists have been ""the beneficiaries of this undeclared war between OPEC and the shale producers,"" Youngberg said.     But at the same time, industry analysts believe the glut will come to an end, inventories will flatten and oil prices will eventually move back up, although many think the days of $100 a barrel oil may be over.     ""We think oil will get back up toward $60 (a barrel), probably in the first half of 2018,"" Youngberg said. ""Originally we thought it would be more toward the end of this year but it will probably leak into next year.""     Another indication of higher prices for consumers came earlier this week.     On Tuesday, a group that included physicist Stephen Hawking and Republican elder statesmen James Baker, George Shultz and Henry Paulson unveiled a plan to tax carbon emissions, starting at $40 per ton of carbon dioxide produced by industry, which is estimated to add 36 cents per gallon to the price of gasoline.     The plan is designed to dampen demand for fossil fuels and is being promoted as a ""free-market, limited government"" response to fight global warming while replacing government programs such as the Clean Power Plan and protect companies from climate change-related lawsuits.     Oil giants ExxonMobil, BP and Shell have come out in support of the plan.     ""A carbon tax is a difficult thing to get your hands around,"" Youngberg said. ""I will say, at the end of the day who pays for a carbon tax? It's the consumer and it will eventually flow into gasoline prices at the pump.""     rob.nikolewski@sduniontribune.com     (619) 293-1251 Twitter: @robnikolewski     ALSO     Losing clout, OPEC tries to boost oil prices     The ripple effects of California's gasoline tax increase     How much you REALLY pay in gasoline taxes     ___

0,Ventura County Star (CA). 06/19/2017.,Article,,,,2W62041996471,Newspaper Source,Simi Valley set to renew underground crude oil pipeline agreement,"Mike Harris     June 19--The Simi Valley City Council intends to allow Crimson California Pipeline to continue operating a crude oil pipeline that runs under the city for another 25 years.     The company's current 25-year franchise agreement with the city is set to expire July 2.     At its meeting Monday night, the council introduced an ordinance without any objections from members of the public to renew the agreement for another 25 years.     Read more:     * Former Simi Valley Community Foundation director pleads guilty* Dog found in Simi with severe burns* Simi man arrested after burglary, high-speed chase     The ordinance is scheduled to be adopted at the council's July 24 meeting.     The company will be allowed to continue to operate the Torrey Pipeline for the three-week period after its current agreement expires and until the renewed agreement is adopted, city officials said.     The portion of the 12-inch pipeline located within Simi Valley runs underneathTapo Canyon Road from the city's northern boundary to Alamo Street.It continues south along Tapo Canyon and exits the city's eastern boundaries through the area near the American Jewish University's Brandeis-Bardin campus.     The pipeline carries an average daily flow of 714,000 gallons of crude oil to Crimson's Los Angeles-area refineries.     The renewed franchise agreement will also apply to a second, though inactive, underground pipeline also owned by Crimson. The 4-inch Moorpark Pipeline enters the city limits near the intersection of Anderson Drive and Avenida Simi and runs east along Avenida Simi to Tapo Canyon, where it connects to the Torrey Pipeline.     Crimson has indicated it has no plans in the foreseeable future to reactivate it, according to a staff report prepared by Linda Swan, assistant to City Manager Eric Levitt.     Both pipelines are part of the Los Angeles Basin Gathering System.     Pursuant to the California Public Utilities Code, under the franchise agreement, the city receives an annual payment from Crimson. The most recent payment, for $26,192, was received in May 2016.     Levitt said Friday that the city has no safety or environmental concerns about the active pipeline, despite another one of Crimson's pipelines spilling about 45,000 gallons of crude oil in Ventura last June.     ""This particular pipeline, which I think is over 50 years old, we haven't had any issues with,"" he said.     Swan added, ""there have been no leaks from this particular pipeline.""     But in an email sent to the city the day after Monday's council meeting, Simi Valley resident Matt Lussier expressed concerns that a strong earthquake could rupture the pipeline, the result being ""a major mess in the city.""     ""So one should ask what they (Crimson) have done to mitigate"" that possibility, he wrote.     Crimson spokeswoman Kendall Klingler said Friday that the pipeline ""meets all integrity tests. During an earthquake of any significant magnitude, the line would be shut down and closely monitored.""     She added that the line wasn't damaged in 1994's magnitude-6.7 Northridge earthquake, ""as underground lines tend to shift with the ground.""     ___

Offshore decommissioning is plugging the oil and gas wells which are matured and are non-productive. Maturing oil and gas fields and aging infrastructure in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico are driving the offshore decommissioning market. Low crude oil prices are other major driver for this market.Europe is the largest market, by value, for offshore decommissioning, followed by North America. The European market is also projected to be the fastest growing market, during the forecast period, owing to mature oil and gas fields, particularly in the U.K. and the North Sea. The impending cessation of production in major oil and gas fields would ensure that the European market would grow at the highest pace. Europe is estimated to witness the highest offshore decommissioning spending, with its well-developed regulatory framework compared to other regions.Well plugging and abandonment constitutes the largest segment of the offshore decommissioning market, by service, in terms of value. Well plugging and abandonment contributes up to 45% of total decommissioning cost of any project. During this activity, detailed well data is collected and prepared for plugging using rig or rig less methods. Demand from the European market is projected to drive the market for well plugging and abandonment.Companies MentionedKey Topics Covered:1 Introduction2 Research Methodology3 Executive Summary4 Premium Insights5 Market Overview6 Offshore Decommissioning Market, By Service Type7 Offshore Decommissioning Market, By Structure8 Offshore Decommissioning Market, By Depth9 Offshore Decommissioning Market, By Region10 Competitive Landscape11 Company Profiles12 AppendixFor more information about this report visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/6w542n/offshoreCONTACT: Research and Markets,Laura Wood,Senior Manager.press@researchandmarkets.comFax from USA: 646-607-1907Fax from rest of the world: +353-1-481-1716Related Topics: Oilfield Equipment and Services (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/categories.asp?cat_id=317&campaign_id=6w542n)((Comments on this story may be sent to info@m2.com))(C)2017 M2 COMMUNICATIONS http://www.m2.comCopyright of M2PressWIRE is the property of M2PressWIRE.

0,"American News (Aberdeen, SD). 05/10/2017.",Article,,,,2W63544709840,Newspaper Source,Dakota Access pipeline leaked 84 gallons of crude oil in Spink County,"Shannon Marvel     May 10--A leaky surge pump along the Dakota Access oil pipeline spilled 84 gallons of crude oil in April at the pump station just north of Crandon in Spink County.     That's according to Brian Walsh, an environmental scientist with state Department of Environment and Natural Resources Ground Water Quality Program.     The pipeline, which will move oil from shale formations in western North Dakota roughly 1,170 miles to Patoka, Ill., is not yet operational. In north-central South Dakota, it cuts through Campbell, McPherson, Edmunds, Faulk and Spink counties.     According to American News archives, the pump station is on 10.59 acres of land in rural Spink County that Dakota Access purchased Feb. 3, 2016, from Donald Gene and Rita Mary Masat. Crandon is southeast of Redfield and east of Tulare.     ""At the pipeline's pump station there's what's called a surge tank, which is used to store crude oil occasionally during the regular operation of the pipeline,"" Walsh said in a phone interview with the American News Tuesday. ""And connected to that tank is a pump, which pumps oil back into the pipeline system, and the leak occurred at that surge pump.""     Richard B. Kuprewicz said pipeline pump stations are typically built in such a way that oil releases stay within the station boundaries. He is a pipeline infrastructure expert and incident investigator with more than 40 years of energy industry experience.     ""The releases in the pump station are better than having it on the main line. It sounds like it occurred during the process of commissioning the line,"" Kuprewicz said.     ""As far as this happening during the start-up, I don't want to make it sound like a major event, but the fact that you had oil leaving the tank says there's something not right with their procedures. They might have been trying to hurry,"" he said.     The cause could also be due to human error, he added.     ""It shouldn't happen, but if it did happen, at least it happened in the pump station. They need to figure out why this happened,"" Kuprewicz said     Vicki Granado, spokeswoman for the Texas-based developer Energy Transfer Partners, said the spill was due to a malfunction during the line fill process.     ""Before a line goes into service you have to fill it with crude oil first,"" she said.     Granado said the line-fill process should be finished within the next few weeks and the pipeline should be in service by June 1.     Walsh said all the crude oil was recovered through absorbent materials and was contained in drums, then put back into the line. Dakota Access was responsible for cleaning up the spill, which it has done, he said.     The state will not fine or issue a citation against the company since the spill was reported and cleaned up within the required time frame, Walsh said.     The spilled crude oil, which is roughly equal to two barrels, is a very small amount compared to the 470,000 barrels of crude oil the pipeline is designed to carry in a day.     ""The whole pump station is lined because they have some above-ground pipeline infrastructure there, so if it does leak it makes it easier to clean up and safer for the environment,"" Walsh said.     Granado said the spill stayed within the company's workspace, or containment area, which is covered with a special lining ""that does not allow anything to actually touch or hit the soil.""     Some gravel was removed from the spill site and will be taken to the Brown County Landfill after sampling of the soils is finished, according to Walsh. The Brown County Landfill routinely takes deliveries of contaminated soil from throughout the region.     Once the state receives the paperwork for disposal and spill site samples, the case will be closed, Walsh said.     This is the first and only spill in the state associated with the Dakota Access Pipeline to date, he said.     Follow @smarvel_AAN on Twitter.     ___

The manual piston cylinder allows for sampling at low-pressure points and in sealed environments.""The most important aspect of the new standard is the ability to capture live crude oil and condensate samples in sealed containers, which minimizes the potential for loss of components during sampling, handling and transport to the laboratory for testing,"" says Murray, the principle consultant at Omnicon Consultants Inc. ""This minimizes the risk of test results being biased by the sampling method used, thereby providing results that are representative of the source material.""""Considering the high volume of crude oil, condensate and diluent now transported by rail, truck, pipeline and ship, this standard will be very helpful,"" he says.The new standard (D8009, Practice for Manual Piston Cylinder Sampling for Volatile Crude Oils, Condensates and Liquid Petroleum Products) is under the joint jurisdiction of ASTM International Committee D02 on Petroleum Products, Liquid Fuels and Lubricants, and the American Petroleum Institute's Committee on Petroleum Management.The new standard was developed in concert with two other new ASTM standards:* Test Method for Determination of Vapor Pressure of Crude Oil: VPCRx-F(Tm°C) (Manual Expansion Field Method) (D7975); and* Test Method for Determination of Light Hydrocarbons and Cut Point Intervals in Live Crude Oils and Condensates by Gas Chromatography (D8003).Murray says that the three standards help close measurement gaps between testing in the field, sampling and analysis. D7975 allows onsite field vapor pressure measurement, which may prompt sampling via D8009 to allow transport to the laboratory to verify the field measurement by a previously approved standard (D6377, Test Method for Determination of Vapor Pressure of Crude Oil: VPCRx (Expansion Method) while D8003 can be used to perform compositional analysis to identify the specific component(s) causing the high vapor pressure.To purchase standards, visit www.astm.org and search by the standard designation, or contact ASTM Customer Relations (tel +1.877.909.ASTM; sales@astm.org).

The global crude oil flow improvers market was valued at $1,282 million in 2016, growing at a CAGR of 5.7% to reach $1,920 million by 2023.   Crude oil flow improvers function as additive that provides suitable solution during crude oil extraction processes and maximize the production. Viscosity of heavy crude oil is crucial for long-distance transport to maintain its quality or state. Crude oil flow improvers enable reduction in viscosity of oil for processing and transport, thereby improving production performance and reducing operational costs. It is extracted from remote locations; hence, it is essential to transport extracted oil to appropriate destinations through pipelines, which is the most preferred and efficient way. High viscosity of heavy crude oil and its transportation specifically in cold regions is quite challenging as it becomes thicker with the decrease in temperature. Thus, crude oil flow improvers are widely used to control viscosity, reduce the turbulence, and increase the flow rate inside the pipelines.   The global crude oil flow improver market is segmented based on type, application, and geography. On the basis of type, it is divided as paraffin inhibitors, asphaltene inhibitors, scale inhibitors, and hydrate inhibitors. On the basis of application, it is categorized into extraction, pipeline, and refinery. Geographically, it is analyzed across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and LAMEA.

I am confident that in the coming year this initiative will be implemented in one form or another,"" he said.The oil companies have complained about low oil refining margins in Russia. The Energy Ministry has given instructions to work out measures to support the refining industry. One calls for introduction of a so-called negative or reverse excise tax on crude oil that a company supplies to its own refineries in Russia to produce gasoline and aviation kerosene. The size of the excise will depend on the production volume of these fuel types.The scheme hasn't been worked out yet. So far, the Energy Ministry has only been instructed to prepare a report for the government on measures to support the oil refining sector by January 15, which will contain the main outlines for introducing a negative excise tax.The Finance Ministry previously examined options for introducing a negative excise tax on crude oil as export duties on crude oil are removed.Jh nb(Our editorial staff can be reached at eng.editors@interfax.ru)Copyright (c) 2017 Interfax.

The Partnership funded the transaction with available capacity on its revolving credit facility.   “We are proud to announce the successful repositioning of an underutilized asset to create a competitive network solution for our new customer’s growing oil sands production,” said Dan Borgen, the Partnership’s Chief Executive Officer. “Our Hardisty to Stroud rail solution delivers immediate takeaway capacity, preserves the integrity of our customer’s heavy barrels and enables substantial end market optionality at Cushing with available pipeline capacity to the Gulf Coast.”   “This transaction reinforces the strategic positioning of our Hardisty asset and confirms our long-held view that rail will continue as an important component of midstream transportation infrastructure in Western Canada,” said Jim Albertson, Vice President, Commercial Development – Canada. “We expect the pairing of the Stroud destination terminal with our advantaged origination terminals will drive additional commercial opportunities, particularly as we approach another cycle where growing crude oil production from Western Canada will exceed available takeaway capacity.”   The Stroud terminal is located on 76-acres and includes 104 railcar spots with the ability to unload one unit train per day, two 70,000 barrel onsite storage tanks and one truck bay. Additionally, the terminal includes a 12-inch diameter, 17-mile pipeline directly connected to the Cushing hub. Inbound product is delivered by the Stillwater Central Rail, which handles deliveries from both the BNSF and the Union Pacific railways. The Partnership also obtained a lease for 300,000 barrels of crude oil tank storage at the Cushing hub to receive outbound shipments of crude oil from the Stroud terminal.   To facilitate the origination of barrels from the Partnership’s Hardisty terminal, USD Marketing LLC (“USDM”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of USD Group LLC (“USDG”), assumed the terminalling services agreement the Partnership previously had with J. Aron & Company at the Hardisty terminal and entered into an agreement with the Stroud customer to provide access to the combined monthly loading slots previously held by both USDM and J. Aron. Additionally, the contracted term for this capacity has been extended to June 30, 2020.   In exchange for contributing its Hardisty rail slots to facilitate the origination of barrels for the Stroud customer, the Partnership granted USDM the right to market the remaining capacity at the Stroud terminal in exchange for a per barrel marketing fee. USDM will fund any related capital costs associated with increasing the throughput or efficiency of the terminal to handle additional barrels. Management anticipates that the fees from USDM for any incremental barrels will be accretive to the Partnership’s cash flows from operating activities and distributable cash flow. Upon expiration of the Stroud customer’s contract in June 2020, the same marketing rights will apply to throughput in excess of the throughput necessary for the Stroud terminal to generate Adjusted EBITDA that is at least equal to the average monthly Adjusted EBITDA from the Stroud customer during the 12 months prior to expiration. The Partnership also granted USDG the right to develop other projects at the Stroud terminal in exchange for the payment of market compensation for the use of the Partnership’s property for such development projects. Any such development projects would be wholly-owned by USDG and would be subject to the Partnership’s right of first offer with respect to midstream projects developed by USDG.   The Partnership has posted a presentation on its website with additional information regarding its acquisition of the Stroud terminal. The presentation can be accessed from the Partnership’s website at http://investor.usdpartners.com/events-and-presentations.

[ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,bizwire.c78125027,Regional Business News,"Fairway Energy Partners, LLC’s Houston Crude Oil Storage Facility Commences Commercial Operations"," Fairway Energy Partners, LLC (Fairway) today announced that it has commenced initial commercial operation at its Pierce Junction Crude Oil Storage Facility. The project will serve the Houston area’s crude oil storage needs driven by the significant growth of pipeline-delivered crude oil into and through the Houston market.   Fairway began construction in 2015 to convert three existing underground storage caverns at the Pierce Junction Salt Dome in south Houston into crude oil storage service and to build out the supporting infrastructure to put the facility into commercial service.   The recently completed phase of construction (Phase 1A) allows for the storage of crude oil in three segregated caverns that have a total capacity of approximately 7.5 million barrels. Fairway constructed brine ponds with approximately 6.5 million barrels of capacity and central pumping and metering facilities at the site.   Phase 1A also included the construction of two separate bi-directional, 24-inch pipelines that will connect the facility to the existing Houston area crude oil grid. The pipelines connect the facility to the Genoa Junction and Speed Junction hubs. This is expected to enable Fairway to receive inbound crude oil from the Permian and Eagle Ford Basins, the Mid-Continent and Canadian regions as well as the Gulf of Mexico. The hubs also are expected to provide downstream connectivity to terminals, refineries and water outlets located in the Houston Ship Channel, Texas City and the Beaumont/Port Arthur market areas.   The facility’s initial operating capacity is 70 percent subscribed. Now that Fairway has commenced operations, it is beginning to store crude oil for its customers, and Fairway is pursuing efforts to reach its full initial operating capacity.   “We believe Fairway’s facility is responding to what our customers want and what the Houston market needs: a more efficient crude oil market, which will result in lower costs for storing and shipping crude oil,” said Fairway CEO Chris Hilgert. “We look forward to providing agile and flexible services that enhance our customers’ market positions.”   Construction of Phase 1B, which will increase the physical storage capacity by approximately 2.6 million barrels to 10.1 million barrels and increase brine pond capacity to an equivalent capacity. That project is expected to commence in the second half of 2017, depending on customer commitments.

In specific, we discuss about two types of carbon materials which have been through the peak of hype cycle namely carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene.Considering that these materials posses unique properties and are increasingly being adopted for product development across industries, we look at different synthesis methods, innovation ecosystem, product development focus areas and market potential forecast to 2025. We briefly discuss some processes which utilize innovative methods to re-use waste plastic and rubbers as carbon source to synthesize CNTs and graphene.In 2017, the global primary energy consumption grew by 2.2% as compared to 2016 which was the highest growth since 2013. Six different resources are considered as primary energy sources which include crude oil, coal, hydroelectricity, nuclear energy, natural gas and renewables. Of these, crude oil accounts for nearly 37% while coal takes the 2nd spot with ~30% and natural gas has the 3rd largest share at 25%.While renewables are the fastest growing closely followed by natural gas, utilization of crude oil as a primary energy source is declining primarily due to volatility in benchmark prices driven by geopolitical instability and supply disruptions. Following the 2015 downturn, the oil industry has been pushed to re-look at their growth strategies and align their businesses to benefit from emerging trends such as circular economy, lightweighting, electrification and miniaturization.In this quest, crude oil producers are looking to identify new opportunities for materials derived from crude oil in the context of circularity objectives set by different industries. One of the major opportunities is to utilize hydrocarbon as a source in production of advanced carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene and to recycle waste from by-products of crude oil to produce high value materials.Key Topics Covered:1.0 Executive Summary1.01 Research Scope1.02 Research Methodology1.03 Sustainability and Efficiency Take Centre Stage in a Circular Economy1.04 Tuneable Properties Realized in Macro-scale Create New Opportunities1.05 Graphene - A Wonder Material With Strong Competition and Processing Concerns2.0 Trends Facilitating Development of New Materials from Crude2.01 Oil Price Recovery Gives an Opportunity to Re-calibrate Growth Plans2.02 E&amp;P Companies Need to Re-think on Greenfield Investment Strategies2.03 Investment in Shale Prospects Heats-up Amid Profitability Concerns2.04 South America Paints a Gloomy Picture With Argentina as a Bright Spot2.05 China's Appetite for Natural Gas Set to Witness an Uptick as Government Eases Barriers to Attract Oil Majors3.0 Circular Economy Trends Driving Material Innovations3.01 Global Mega Trends Driving the Shift Toward a Circular Economy3.02 Goal Setting for Material Developer in a Circular World3.03 End Use Industry Needs Driving Material Development Interest4.0 Opportunities for Carbon Nanotubes4.01 Carbon Nanotubes: Rolled-up Sheets of Graphene Named Bucky Tubes4.02 Tuneable Properties of CNTs in Nanoscale Enable New Functionalities4.03 Unique Properties of CNTs Are of Value to Push Global Trends4.04 Funding &amp; Investments Directed Toward Up-scaling and Production Expansion of CNT-based products4.05 Patents Relate to Use of CNTs for Nanocomposite Development New Synthesis and Treatment Methods Continue to Evolve4.06 Electronics Industry: Transition from Silicon to Carbon for Advanced Nanoelectronic Systems4.07 Memory Devices: High Impact Application Segment - NRAM's Capabilities Designed to Push Autonomous Vehicles and IIoT4.08 Energy Industry:: CNTs have Multiple Roles to Play in the Energy Transition4.09 Batteries: High Impact Application Segment - CNTs Enable Lightweight Super Strong Energy Storage Devices4.10 Oil &amp; Gas Industry: CNT as an Additive to Cement and Drilling Fluids is Being Explored4.11 OPC-CNT Composites:CNTs Can Act as Microscopic Rebars but Challenges Remain4.12 Oil Well Cementing: MWCNTs Could Solve Well Integrity Problems in HPHT Environment4.13 Enhanced Oil Recovery: Super-strong Multifunctional Proppants for Use in Hydraulic Fracking4.14 Textile Industry:CNT-based Textile Fibers Pave Way for Smart Fabrics4.15 Wearable Batteries:Spider Silk-like CNT Fibers to Transform Soldier Comfort and Agility4.16 CNT Market Expected to Reach Tipping Point in Short-term and Grow to a $10.2 billion by 20254.17 Large Scale Production of Customized CNT Grades at 20% Lower Price Expected to Propel Growth in Adoption4.18 Arc Discharge Method Beats Laser Ablation in Yield and Cost Efficiency4.19 New Approaches to Reduce Material Cost and Maintain CNT quality in Arc Discharge4.20 Overcoming Inefficiencies Through New Carbon Sources4.21 CVD - A Widely Used Method Explored with Light Oil as Feedstock4.22 New Routes to CNTs Through Polymers Being Explored to Improve Circularity5.0 Opportunities for Graphene5.01 Graphene: A Non-metal Carbon Material With Metal-like Properties5.02 Market Growth Hugely Depends on the Pace of Nano to Macro Replication5.03 Graphene Synthesis Methods - An Overview5.04 Top-down Methods Involving Direct Exfoliation of Graphite5.05 The Graphene Oxide Route and Epitaxial Growth Methods5.06 CVD: Large Surface Coverage With Self-restrictive Growth Possibilities5.07 Multiple Property-level Dependencies Complicate Application Prospects5.08 Highly Fragmented Industry With Partnership Opportunities5.09 Investments Push for Graphene-based Products With Saleable Benefits5.10 Graphene in Composites and Their use in Energy Storage Tops the List5.11 Graphene Market Expected to Record Rapid Growth in Short-Term5.12 Application Segments Contributing to Market Growth6.0 Advances in Material Informatics Facilitating Development of New Materials6.01 Paradigm Shift From Empirical to Data Driven Approach6.02 Convergence of Material Informatics and Big Data Analytics6.03 Extracting Actionable PSPP Linkage to Enable Data-driven Materials Discovery and Design6.04 Supervised Data Mining Techniques Used for Predictive Modeling6.05 Use Case 1: Predictive Analytics for New Engine Lubrication and Traction Materials6.06 Use Case 2: Predictive Analytics for Stable Compound Discovery7.0 Key Patents7.01 Key Patents Related to Carbon Nanotubes7.02 Key Patents Related to Graphene8.0 Key ContactsFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/23mds7/lucrative?w=5Did you know that we also offer Custom Research?

(""Tidewater"" or the ""Corporation"") announces today that it and TransAlta Corporation (""TransAlta"") have executed definitive agreements (the ""Definitive Agreements"") for the construction, operation and tolls payable with respect to the previously announced pipeline connecting Tidewater's Brazeau River Complex to TransAlta's generating units at Sundance and Keephills. The Definitive Agreements provide for Tidewater to construct and operate a 20-inch, 120 km natural gas pipeline with initial capacity of 130 MMcf/d which may be expanded to approximately 440 MMcf/d. The pipeline project is supported by a fifteen (15) year firm take-or-pay shipping agreement with TransAlta. As design of the project progressed and to address demand, Tidewater and TransAlta determined to increase maximum capacity of the pipeline to approximately 440 MMcf/d compared to the original design capacity of 340 MMcf/d. As a result of the increased capacity of approximately 30%, the current budget for the project has increased by approximately 5%-10% when compared to the previously announced budget estimate of $150 million. TransAlta has an option to participate in the pipeline by acquiring up to a 50% ownership interest in the project and it is likely that TransAlta will exercise this option. The project remains on schedule, with a projected in-service date in Q3/Q4 of 2019 and remains subject to customary conditions and regulatory approval.Update on Pipestone Montney, Sour Deep-Cut Gas Processing ComplexTidewater continues to progress its plans to construct and operate its previously announced Pipestone Montney, Sour Deep-Cut Gas Processing Complex (the ""Pipestone Plant"") in the Pipestone area near Grande Prairie, Alberta. Tidewater is pleased to announce that a definitive agreement has been executed with a large oil and gas producer with respect to the previously announced (September 11, 2018) memorandum of understanding regarding a 25 MMcf/d commitment at the Pipestone Plant over a five-year term. The Pipestone Plant is designed to process approximately 100 MMcf/d of natural gas and is currently 80% contracted with firm commitments of 80 MMcf/d with the remaining capacity of 15-20 MMcf/d subject to non-binding letters of intent that are expected to be formalized by definitive agreements within 30 days. The additional agreements at the Pipestone Plant are expected to increase total forecasted annualized EBITDA from the project by 10% – 20%.Overall project costs remain in-line with previous guidance with a forecast total capital outlay to Tidewater of approximately $210MM. This amount excludes the 32MW cogeneration units all or a portion of which Tidewater expects to monetize. The cogeneration units would generate both heat and electricity from the same fuel input to the Pipestone Plant. The units could be sold to a third party or to a subsidiary of Tidewater in connection with Tidewater's power supply business. The sale of the cogeneration units was contemplated in the original Pipestone Plant project economics and is not expected to impact forecasted EBITDA. The Pipestone Plant remains subject to regulatory approval which Tidewater hopes to receive shortly.Additional Tidewater applications remain before the Alberta Energy Regulator for infrastructure in the Pipestone area that would ultimately connect to the Pipestone Plant.Crude oil storage, transportation and infrastructure agreementsTidewater is pleased to announce that it has entered into crude oil storage and transportation agreements with various counterparties, including an investment grade counterparty. Tidewater will provide crude oil terminalling services at three existing Tidewater owned, operated and pipeline connected facilities in the Valhalla, Brazeau River and Acheson areas of Alberta. In addition, Tidewater will transport crude oil by rail to various markets in North America from its rail facility located at Acheson, Alberta utilizing Tidewater's rail car fleet. The aforementioned agreements are for terms of less than twelve months, however, Tidewater intends to grow this business and negotiate longer term agreements with existing and new customers. Tidewater has currently invested minimal capital in new infrastructure related to crude oil storage and transportation services while also utilizing its existing infrastructure. Based on this minimal capital investment, Tidewater expects to generate approximately 5% - 10% of incremental annualized EBITDA in 2019.Tidewater began its crude oil operations subsequent to the expiration of a non-competition covenant made by certain members of Tidewater's executive in relation to the sale of a company prior to the formation of Tidewater.The Corporation's BusinessTidewater is traded on the TSX under the symbol ""TWM"". Tidewater's business objective is to build a diversified midstream and infrastructure company in the North American natural gas and natural gas liquids (""NGL"") space. Its strategy is to profitably grow and create shareholder value through the acquisition and development of oil and gas infrastructure. Tidewater plans to achieve its business objective by providing customers with a full service, vertically integrated value chain through the acquisition and development of oil and gas infrastructure including: gas plants, pipelines, railcars, trucks, export terminals and storage facilities.Cautionary NotesAdvisory Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsIn the interest of providing Tidewater's shareholders and potential investors with information regarding Tidewater, including management's assessment of Tidewater's future plans and operations, certain statements in this press release are ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and ""forward-looking information"" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation (collectively, ""forward-looking statements"").

[ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,6FPTS2016120640800089,Newspaper Source,OPEC seeks crude oil cuts from 14 nations.,"NEW DELHIOPEC has invited 14 other crude producers, who together pump about a fifth of the world's oil, to talks this week in Vienna aimed at securing wider co-operation with production cuts.Russia already committed to reduce its output by 300,000 barrels a day following the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) agreement last week to a production cut of 1.2 million, Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said. Major producers, including Mexico and Kazakhstan, along with relative minnows like Bolivia and Uzbekistan, have been asked to attend talks with OPEC ministers in Vienna on Dec. 10, he said.Oil prices have risen 18 per cent since OPEC's surprise agreement last week to make its first supply cuts in eight years, which was also the first accord since the late 1990s involving non-members. The new 32.5 million barrel-a-day production target is only slightly below the group's estimate for demand for its crude next year, meaning wider co-operation is needed to make a significant dent in the record stockpile surplus that has built up during three years of oversupply.""It remains unclear to us which other non-OPEC producers might be willing to commit to or even claim production cuts,"" JBC Energy said in a note. ""Although OPEC officials spoke of a 300,000 barrel-a-day contribution from Russia towards an overall 600,000 barrel-a-day non-OPEC cut, we remain quite skeptical that this will actually happen.""After Russia, Mexico is the largest producer invited to Vienna. While the nation's output is expected to fall by about 150,000 barrels a day next year to 1.94 million due to the natural decline in production at aging fields, the country doesn't plan on any further cuts, a Pemex official said last week.Kazakhstan, the next-largest producer, with a daily output of about 1.7 million barrels, will decide on whether to cut output after talks with OPEC, the Astana-based Energy Ministry press service said in a statement Dec. 2.Oman, which pumps about one million barrels a day, has committed to matching any oil-output cut agreed by OPEC up to a maximum of 10 per cent.The other invitees are Bahrain, Colombia, Congo, Egypt, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Brunei. Altogether, the 14 nations pumped about 18.8 million barrels a day of oil last year, equivalent to 20 per cent of global supply, according to data from British Petroleum.OPEC agreed to a production cut of 1.2 million barrels last week.Ramzi Boudina/ReutersCopyright of Toronto Star (Canada) is the property of Toronto Star.

It mentions that automation could provide oilfields with various advantages which include monitoring capabilities, reduction in operating costs, and predictive maintenance.",1250,131356550,Regional Business News,How Technology Is Changing the Oil and Gas Industry.,"New ProductsOnce considered to be merely on the horizon of the oil and gas industry, automation has taken center stage in recent years. With technological advancements catching up to the human imagination, there has been a gradual shift to automated technologies in virtually every industry. By reducing the time, error, and risk involved in human labor, today's sophisticated automation tools can be hugely beneficial to companies of all kinds.For the oil and gas industry, in particular, the shift to automation was as a matter of necessity. When prices for oil fell by 75% over 20 months beginning in 2014, the industry was forced to modernize. Four years later, prices have recovered, hitting record levels in the United States. With this new technology -- and the major advancements sure to come -- the oil and gas sector is poised for unprecedented success. But it is also important to consider whether these machines may replace workers, and how employees' duties may shift.The technology being used in the oil and gas industry today is highly sophisticated. At Devon's WellCon center, engineers are able to view a project remotely on screen, monitoring a 2-mile-long well being drilled 10,000 feet underground. If the drill wanders away from the ""sweet spot"" -- which can be as small as 10 feet across -- an alert is raised, and the engineers call the crew for adjustments. Such precision can only be achieved with a machine, making this one of many benefits the industry can gain from automation.Other key advantages include:* Monitoring capabilities -- With automation, oil and gas companies are able to keep track of their pipes and networks with an unprecedented amount of oversight. With systems like RealSens and investments in terminal automation, companies can monitor entire pipeline networks and remotely detect leaks. Plus, onshore and offshore pipelines are able to be observed for safety using autonomous underwater vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles. This is done to ward off criminal activity, terrorist attacks, and even repair damages. Weather monitoring systems, meanwhile, can be used to detect changes in seismic activity, as well as ocean and atmospheric levels.* Reduced operating costs -- According to McKinsey & Company, effective use of digital technologies could reduce capital expenditures by up to 20%.* Predictive maintenance -- Advanced analytics can now be implemented to detect issues preemptively, before equipment breaks down. By taking these proactive measures, companies can decrease maintenance costs by as much as 13%.* Reservoir limits -- Companies have been able to increase reservoir through the use of digital automation technologies.* Safety -- With automation, workers no longer have to go out into the field to make risky repairs. Instead, augmented reality can be used, or workers can operate drones to make needed repairs.* Efficiency in marketing and distribution -- Advanced analytics provide oil and gas companies with a better picture of consumer habits and desires, while allowing for optimized pricing models and more efficient supply chain management. For example, geospatial analytics can provide insight into route optimization and assist with location planning for different networks.Any discussion of automation will inevitably touch upon the technologies supplanting -- or shifting the roles of -- human labor. Though the industry has been doing well since the 2014 crisis, employment in the oil and gas sector is still down 21% since 2014. ""It seems like they're doing more with less people,"" says Eric Neece a former roughneck for GE Oil & Gas, in a recent Wall Street Journal article.Devon, for example, is down 5,500 employees from December 2014, and laid off 300 workers this past April. Meanwhile, the company has invested more than $100 million in advanced technologies including fiber optic cables and augmented reality. As a result, towns built around the oil and gas economy have been affected, with old industry facilities being converted for other uses.Does this mean workers will be completely supplanted by automated technologies? No, says Jim Claunch, vice president of operational excellence for Statoil. ""The more jewelry we put on the wells and pads out there, we're going to have people that are making sure the sensors are working and the communication is working -- the whole nine years.""The human element will still be needed, just for different applications. Jon Krome of BHP Billiton says, ""Is technology going to outsource everybody? The answer is absolutely not. Is it going to take an edge off of some of the very high-risk, perhaps most manual, of the labor force? Absolutely.""In fact, the more refined these machines become, using algorithms to enhance their learning, the more workers will be able to perform their duties with enhanced safety, efficiency, and sophistication -- and less training. This will create new opportunities for more workers. Instead of being replaced, the ""role of the human operator changes  They will be responsible for making sure they feed clean, relevant data into the algorithms,"" according to Peter Wang, a geophysical technical advisor for Paradigm.Automation offers a range of unique benefit for companies looking to improve their business operations and reduce costs, making technological investments a wise decision. For the people that these systems and tools are replacing, the transition is disruptive. However, these changes will ultimately be very beneficial for the industry as a whole.Ultimately, it is up to oil and gas companies to adjust. To illustrate this, Scott Desmarais of McKinsey & Co., cited the changing automotive industry as a parallel. ""A mechanic 30 years ago didn't use electronics whatsoever. Today, they've almost got to be an electronic tech in addition to pulling that engine out.""Lastly, though, consider this encouraging example in the oil and gas industry: Henry Hopkins of BP used to rely on instinct when deciding which wells to inspect. Now, a computer algorithm maps his route, and he uses augmented reality glasses to send a feed to BP technicians in Denver, who then send him directions and key data, showing him how to perform the complicated duties required. Hopkins is still needed. Knowing how these glasses work and his intimate knowledge of oil wells from years of hands-on experience make him a vital part of the team -- an ideal synthesis of technology and human labor.* https://www.wsj.com/articles/oils-new-technology-spells-end-of-boom-for -roughnecks-1531233085?&mod=djemfoe* https://www.eniday.com/en/technology%5Fen/automation-in-oil-gas-industry/* https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/oil-and-gas/our-insights/ the-next-frontier-for-digital-technologies-in-oil-and-gas* https://www.rigzone.com/news/oil%5Fgas/a/151411/automation%5Fis%5Fthe%5Fkey%5Fto %5Fthe%5Ffuture%5Fof%5Foil%5Fand%5Fgas/* https://www.epmag.com/robotics-automation-and-changing-oil-gas-workforce -1669841* https://www.rigzone.com/news/oil%5Fgas/a/148741/oil%5Fgas%5Fleaders%5Fautomation %5Fabout%5Fefficiency%5Fnot%5Fjob%5Felimination/?all=hg2* https://news.thomasnet.com/fluid-gas-flow/2014/08/13/carbide-coatings -terminal-automation-are-more-opportunities-in-oil-and-gas* https://news.thomasnet.com/fluid-gas-flow/2013/08/21/new-technology-could -reduce-oil-pipeline-leaksImage Credit: manine99/Shutterstock.comTechnician sitting in a control room monitoring a process petrochemical plant.By Conor McGladeCopyright of ThomasNet News is the property of Thomas Publishing Company LLC and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

Any actions on managing shares in the oil project is bound to the oil production agreement. Project participants must be first approved by the regulator, the Ministry of Energy. This is the first level of protection,"" Beketayev told reporters in Astana on Tuesday.""Kazakhstan objects to the arbitration award and will never grant an approval. Interfering in the oil production agreement is impossible without a government consent.

The assets were frozen as part of Stati arbitration award of about $500 million against Kazakhstan.In December 2017 as part of this case nearly $22 billion of Kazakhstan's National Fund (40% of its total volume) was frozen by the Bank of New York Mellon Corp.Kazakhstan, through discovery proceedings in the US, obtained information and documents that revealed that Stati had engaged for years in Kazakhstan in a massive fraudulent scheme. The essence of the fraud was that through a series of undisclosed related party transactions and falsified financial statements, and having had entered into fictitious contracts, the Statis had fraudulently inflated the construction costs of a liquefied petroleum gas plant in Kazakhstan. Furthermore, they had made false statements in front of the international arbitral tribunal.In October 2015, State Fund Samruk-Kazyna acquired KazMunayGas' 50%-stake in the Kashagan project leaving the national company with the right to buy back shares in accordance with an option agreement.In January this year it became known that KazMunaiGas extended for two years the buy-back option regarding this stake in Kashagan currently owned by Samruk-Kazyna.

Feb 13 (Interfax) - Kazakhstan's Energy Ministry has succeeded in lobbying for local content inclusion in design procurement under the forthcoming Karachaganak expansion project.Now as part of the Karachaganak [oil field] expansion project estimated at several billion US dollars a requirement is offered so that designs must be carried out jointly with a Kazakh partner, that is a Kazakh design research company must carry out at least 50% of the scope of designs in Kazakhstan. This stipulation is proposed with regard to the Karachaganak project, CEO of the Union of Oilfield Services Companies Nurlan Zhumagulov told a press conference.KPO invited all the foreign contractors and told them to create joint ventures if they are willing to work under the project, he said.At the same time Zhumagulov told Interfax-Kazakhstan that these agreements on local content regarding design procurement are not legally binding.Karachaganak Petroleum Operating (KPO) has been developing the Karachaganak field since 1997 on the basis of a 40-year production sharing agreement (PSA). Karachaganak oil and gas condensate field is one of the largest in the world, its reserves are estimated at 1.2 billion tonnes of oil and 1.34 trillion cubic meters of gas. In Kazakhstan, similar subsoil use contracts contain fixed terms and conditions, as well as a fixed tax burden, so requirements stipulating at least 50% local content do not apply to PSAs. However, in recent years the Kazakh authorities have been lobbying for the interests of local oilfield service companies negotiating with the operators of major oil and gas projects in order to invite Kazakh contractors to expansion projects. This policy resulted in a decision by the shareholders of Tengizchevroil developing the Tengiz oil field to allocate $12 billion for works and services procurement from Kazakh companies; this expansion project value totals $ 37 billion.ENERGY & RESOURCESKazakhstan toÂ consider options for new refineryASTANA.

Feb 9 (Interfax) - S&P Global Ratings assigned its 'B-/B' long- and short-term issuer credit ratings and 'kzBB-' national scale rating to Kazakhstan-based JSC AsiaCredit Bank.The outlook on the long-term issuer credit rating is stable.The stable outlook reflects our expectation that AsiaCredit Bank will likely be able to demonstrate moderate asset growth while maintaining its current loan book quality and capitalization over the next 12-18 months.""The ratings reflect AsiaCredit Bank's narrow franchise and limited competitive power compared with that of larger banks in Kazakhstan. Although we believe the bank is likely to follow a relatively conservative growth strategy, we think its business model is vulnerable to adverse changes in the operating environment,"" S&P said.S&P considers that the bank currently displays adequate liquidity, and the maturity of assets and liabilities is well matched. Nevertheless, like other small Kazakh banks, AsiaCredit Bank is sensitive to a potential loss of customer confidence and doesn't have steady access to funding from government-related entities. We do not incorporate any support from the Kazakh government into the ratings, due to AsiaCredit Bank's low systemic importance.S&P regards AsiaCredit Bank's capital and earnings as moderate, and project the RAC ratio at 6.5%-7.0% over the next two years.S&P analysts anticipate an 8%-10% increase in lending over the medium term, mainly to retail customers (primarily mortgage loans) and small and midsize enterprises under various government programs. ""The segments that could bring higher margins than corporate lending activities. As a result, we assume in our base case that the bank can slightly improve its net interest margin to 3.7%-3.8% over the next two years from 3.5% in 2017, with corresponding net income of about KZT600 million in 2018 and about KZT900 million in 2019, and no dividends to shareholders,"" S&P said.S&P could lower the ratings if loan growth substantially exceeded our current forecasts and was not supported by the capital base, resulting in the RAC ratio falling below 5%. A negative rating action could also follow a period of substantial pressure on the bank's funding or liquidity profile.A positive rating action is highly unlikely at this stage because it would require a considerable improvement of the bank's business position and the operating environment in Kazakhstan.In 2017, AsiaCredit Bank ranked 20th place in terms of assets among 32 banks of Kazakhstan.EximbankLater in the week, S&P lowered its long- and short-term issuer credit ratings on Eximbank Kazakhstan JSC to 'CCC+/C' from 'B-/B'.""The vulnerability of KazEximbank's asset quality and its funding and liquidity profile led us to revise down our assessment of the bank's stand-alone credit profile (SACP) to 'ccc+' from 'b-' and, in turn, lower the issuer credit rating to 'CCC+' from 'B-',"" S&P said in a statement.S&P also lowered our Kazakh national scale rating on the bank to 'kzB-' from 'kzB+'.S&P placed all ratings on CreditWatch with developing implications.S&P believes that the bank's reliance on favorable business, financial, and economic conditions to meet its financial commitments makes the bank susceptible to negative internal or external developments.""Although KazEximbank may not face a credit or payment crisis in the coming 12 months, we assume that the bank might not be able to meet its financial commitments in the long term in the absence of extraordinary shareholder support,"" S&P said.The CreditWatch developing reflects the uncertainty regarding the bank's ability to clean up its loan portfolio and replace NBK's funding with longer-term sources.S&P expects to resolve the CreditWatch within 90 days, which coincides with the maturity of the NBK funding.A negative rating action will follow if the bank's liquid assets decline below the regulatory minimum, the bank breaches the regulatory capital adequacy ratios, or the bank is unable to repay its liabilities in full and on time.Eximbank Kazakhstan was ranked 26th by assets in 2017 among the 32 second tier banks operating in Kazakhstan, according to the National Bank of the country.Capital BankThe ratings agency also lowered its long- and short-term issuer credit ratings on Capital Bank Kazakhstan JSC (CBK) to 'CCC+/C' from 'B-/B' and the national scale rating to 'kzB-' from 'kzB+'.Long-term issuer credit rating and the national scale rating were placed on CreditWatch with negative implications.BANKING & FINANCEKazakh National Bank suspends licenses ofÂ Salem, Kompetenz insurance companiesASTANA.

This mutually beneficial partnership will create opportunities for ADNOC to increase its market share in delivering high quality crude to India's expanding refining industry, while also helping India meet its growing energy demand and safeguard its security.“India is an important energy market and this storage agreement reinforces ADNOC's role as one of the world's most trusted and reliable suppliers of oil. We will utilise the Mangalore facility to not only build on our existing business relationships across India but also to explore new downstream opportunities for ADNOC's expanding range of refined and petrochemical products,” he added.The Petroleum Minister of India, Dharmendra Pradhan, said: “It is our hope that this strategic agreement will build on the strong bonds of cooperation between our two nations and provide the foundation for a mutually beneficial energy partnership. This will also help to ensure India's energy security and enable us to meet the nation's growing demand for energy. This agreement is also a reflection of the vision of the Honourable Prime Minister of India towards strengthening hydrocarbon linkages with UAE in a win-win basis.”The Mangalore oil storage facility is the third that ADNOC has had access to in Asia. In Japan, the ADNOC has oil stored in the Kiire's Oil Terminal in Kagoshima City, and in South Korea a similar agreement allowed ADNOC to store oil in KNOC's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. In addition to helping to ensure energy security, the oil storage facilities enable ADNOC to efficiently and competitively meet market demand across south east Asia.India is 79 per cent dependent on imports to meet its crude oil needs, eight per cent of which is supplied by the UAE. In addition to the Mangalore facility, the ISPRL is building underground storage facilities at Visakhapatnam, in Andhra Pradesh, and Padur, in Karnataka, to stockpile 20 million barrels of oil, enough to meet India's oil requirement for 10 days.During the visit to India, Dr Al Jaber also signed a MoU to explore options to supply crude oil to West Bengal's Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd's (HPL) new refinery in Kolkata, which will have a consumption capacity of 300,000 barrels of oil per day.Under the terms of the MoU, ADNOC and HPL will also examine the possibility of ADNOC increasing the supply of light refined naphtha to HPL.Copyright 2017 by Emirates News Agency Distributed by UPICopyright of Arabia 2000 is the property of Arabia 2000.

The proposed notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Nostrum Oil & Gas Plc and certain of its subsidiaries, including the group's core operating company Zhaikmunai LLP,â€ the press release says.The negative outlook on Nostrum's ratings captures elevated leverage as well as the risks related to the timely launch of the GTU 3 facility and execution of the drilling program allowing full utilization of GTU 3 despite a pick-up in oil prices over the last several months, according to Moodyâ€™s.â€œThe outlook could be stabilized if Moody's were to see stabilization of production during 2018 provided that the company remains on track with its drilling program and launches GTU 3 in 2018,â€ the press release says.Similar to Nostrum's existing $725 million notes due 2022, the proposed notes will be issued by Nostrum Oil & Gas Finance B.V., a private company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, which is wholly owned by Nostrum Oil & Gas Cooperatief U.A., a 100%-owned subsidiary of Nostrum Oil & Gas Plc.The notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by, inter alia, Zhaikmunai LLP, the group's sole operating subsidiary, which owns substantially all of the group's assets, according to Moodyâ€™s.Zhaikmunai is an independent oil and gas enterprise currently engaging in the exploration, production and sale of crude oil and gas condensate in northwestern Kazakhstan.

Feb 7 (Interfax) - Nord Stream 2 AG may claim damages it the European Union's Gas Directive is extended to import pipelines, the company's managing director, Matthias Warnig, said in an interview with the WirtschaftsWoche publication in Germany.Presently, the EU Gas Directive applies only to the domestic markets of EU member states. The European Commission, in its turn, is demanding a say on matters concerning the pipeline.""I do not understand how extending the Gas Directive beyond the EU will work,"" Warnig said. ""If EU terms lead to negative fallout for us, the issue of claiming damages will be raised,"" he said.EU terms may lead to a change in company ownership. According to current European legislation, one entity cannot be both the owner and operator of a pipeline. Gazprom is the sole shareholder of Nord Stream 2 and its operator. The pipeline is being financed by Gazprom and five foreign companies: Uniper, Shell, Wintershall, OMV and Engie.Denmark should consider Russia's application for the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline based on the laws valid in the European Union at the moment of its submission, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday.""We addressed the consideration by Denmark of the application for building the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in the kingdom's territorial waters. We highlighted our principled position that this application must be considered based on the laws existing both in Denmark and in the European Union in general as of the moment when this application was submitted,"" Lavrov said following negotiations with Danish Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen.The application in question was submitted in April 2017, Lavrov said.PIPELINES AND TRANSPORTATIONSovcomflot fines USC's Finnish shipyard for delay on Sakhalin-2 vessels - paperMOSCOW. Feb 5 (Interfax) - Sovcomflot (SCF), Russia's largest shipping company, has fined Arctech Helsinki Shipyard, a division of United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC), for holding up delivery of four support vessels for the Sakhalin-2 oil and gas project, national daily Kommersant reported on Monday.The shipyard was late delivering all four vessels: supply ship Gennady Nevelskoi and standby vessels Stepan Makarov, Fyodor Ushakov and Yevgeny Primakov, which will operate under a long-term charter contract for Sakhalin Energy.The companies did not disclose the amount of the fines. USC president Alexei Rakhmanov said that the initial fines were reduced by 30% for three vessels and by 70% for the Yevgeny Primakov, the delay for which ""was about seven months and was related exclusively to the imposition of sanctions on USC.""SCF declined to comment, the paper said. ""Initially the amount of fines was simply astronomical, but in the end it amounted to about $50 million,"" the paper reported a source as saying.The Finnish shipyard had a particularly difficult time in 2015, when it was left without financing. After Crimea became part of Russia and sanctions were imposed against a number of Russian companies, including USC, western banks refused to work with Arctech. Only after a year did USC manage to secure a forex loan from Sberbank to complete the orders. At the end of 2016, the corporation refinanced $435 million at state bank VTB at 4.5% annual interest.""The contract only had a 20% advance, so we had to look for 80% ourselves,"" Rakhmanov was reported as saying by the paper.But the shipyard's financial problems are not confined to the SCF fines. Construction of the Project 21900M Murmansk icebreaker for Rosmorport was paralysed in Helsinki in 2015 for the same reason.""We're not as worried about losses from the construction of the series, as we are by the matter with the icebreaker. Before we got full control of the shipyard, it was contracted by our Finnish colleagues in rubles with a 60% share of foreign components. As a result, we get an exchange rate difference that no one has compensated,"" Rakhmanov said. The loss amounted to about half the price of the icebreaker, he said.USC is now trying to bring orders for cruise ships with displacement of up to 75,000 tonnes to its Finnish shipyard. ""We have preliminary talks with Japanese customers. A Chinese operating company is also interested,"" Rakhmanov said.Considering the finance losses in recent years, Arctech will not earn a profit in the next seven years, so a financial recovery through bankruptcy is a possibility, he said. This is how USC sorted out the debts of Baltiysky Zavod, which was split into two legal entities that were merged only recently.However, USC is hoping for support from Kermas Group, with which negotiations are being held to sell a controlling stake in Arctech. The group owns Croatian shipyard Brodotrogir, which a year ago laid the fore part of a tanker to carry gas condensate that was ordered from Arctech for the Yamal LNG project. Kermas hopes to boost utilization of capacity at the Croatian shipyard by working on orders placed with Arctech.PIPELINES AND TRANSPORTATIONTurkmenistan, Turkey's Calyk sign memorandum to build power lines along TAPIASHGABAT.

The oil pipeline monopoly's vice president, Sergei Andronov, told Interfax in an interview in November that the level of high-sulfur crude supply using the Transneft system will total 87.5 million tonnes in 2018, 88 million tonnes in 2019 and 88.5 million tonnes in 2020.""We can see three main reasons for the changing quality of crude in the system. The first is without doubt an increase in supply of highly sulfurous oil into the Transneft system, which was 5 million tonnes in the period 2014-2017. The second is a reduction in high-sulfur crude throughput at Russian refineries of 4.5 million tonnes in the same period. But the main factor is the planned re-routing of 12 million tonnes of crude, starting in 2018, from West to East, in connection with the need to honor contracts signed in fulfillment of inter-governmental agreements between Russia and China,"" Andronov said. It is for the profile ministry to reach a decision on this.The discussion of ways to stimulate the oil refining industry is still at an early stage and a meeting with cabinet ministers is planned for the last ten days of February, Lukoil chief Vagit Alekperov told reporters following the meeting between oil companies and the Energy Ministry.""The budget benefits to the tune of $50 billion from the participation of oil companies in the OPEC+ deal, and that could stimulate oil refining,"" he said.""Lukoil's position on refining is still to keep the export duty in place in the medium term. That will make it possible to complete all refinery upgrades,"" he said.Oil companies have been complaining about low oil refining margins in Russia. The Energy Ministry has been given instructions to work out measures to support the refining industry. One calls for introduction a negative excise tax on crude oil that a company supplies to its own refineries in Russia to produce gasoline and aviation kerosene. The size of the excise would depend on the production volume of these fuel types.The Finance Ministry insists that proposals to introduce the negative excise tax on crude oil be tied in with the need to abolish export duty on oil. Both ministries plan to finalize their proposals to stimulate refining before the end of March.Apart from Lukoil's Alekperov, the meeting on Tuesday was due to be attended by Pavel Fyodorov, first vice president of Rosneft; Surgutneftegas chief Vladimir Bogdanov; Vadim Yakovlev, first deputy head of Gazprom Neft; Maxim Grishanin, first vice president of Transneft; Zarubezhneft head Sergei Kudryashov; Novatek first deputy CEO Alexander Fridman; Tatneft deputy head Azat Yagafarov; and RussNeft owner Mikhail Gutseriev.CIS, BALTIC and international NEWSGazprom could raise gas output to 476 bcm in 2018 from 471 bcm in 2017MOSCOW. Feb 6 (Interfax) â€“ Gazprom held its latest Investor Day in New York on Tuesday. Company officials told investors the Russian gas giant is planning to produce 476 billion cubic meters of gas in 2018, following the 471 bcm it produced in 2017. They said Gazprom raised its share of the European gas market to 34.7% in 2017 from 33.1% in 2016. Gazprom revised its estimate for natural gas exports to non-FSU countries in 2017 to 194.4 billion cubic meters, and said that Ukraine's gas transmission system remains functional only because it is not loaded to capacity. Gazprom announced it has so far built 1,480 kilometers of the 2,158-km linear section of kits Power of Siberia gas pipeline and had laid around 800 km of the two TurkStream lines by the beginning of February. Gazprom said it expects annual investment to stabilize at the level 1 trillion rubles or lower once the record investment in 2018 and 2019 (1.4 trillion rubles) has passed.PRODUCTION: Another year of growthGazprom is planning to produce 476 billion cubic meters of gas in 2018, following the 471 bcm it produced in 2017, the head of Gazprom's Department 307, Vsevolod Cherepanov, said at a meeting with investors in New York.""Actual gas production in 2017 was 471 bcm, which was 52 bcm more than in 2016. Most of the gas was produced at fields in the Nadym-Pur-Tazovsky district - 348 bcm. The gas production plan for 2018 is 476 bcm,"" Cherepanov said.Gazprom produced 82.7 bcm at the Bovanenkovo field on the Yamal Peninsula, above a targeted 76.7 bcm.EXPORTS: Market share growingGazprom revised its estimate for natural gas exports to non-FSU countries in 2017 to 194.4 billion cubic meters from 193.9 bcm previously.""The year 2017 was a special one for Gazprom. Last year our company set an absolute record for gas exports to Europe in the whole history of the Soviet and Russian gas industry, supplying 194.4 bcm of gas. This is about one-fourth of all the cross-border trade in pipeline gas worldwide,"" Medvedev said.Gazprom exported 179.3 bcm of gas in 2016.Medvedev said the average export price of Gazprom's gas last year was $196.7 per thousand cubic meters. This was $224 per thousand cubic meters of $6.4 per MBtu in January this year, and the forecast for February is $221 per thousand cubic meters, $6.29 per MBtu.Gazprom exported 17.2 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas to non-FSU countries in January 2018, Gazprom's information department reported.The total is 1.9 bcm or 10% less than in January 2017, ""which was the highest monthly volume in the company's history,"" it said.The decline was largely due to warm weather in European countries, Gazprom said.""That said, the total for January 2018 was 2.1 bcm or 13.9% more than in January 2016 and 13.8% more than the average in 2015-2017,"" the company said.Average temperatures in Europe were warmer in January 2018 than a year earlier by approximately 4 degrees Celsius. Interfax Global Gas Analytics also notes lower demand for gas in Europe from the power generation sector, which competes with other energy sources, particularly renewable energy.Another reason for the export slowdown is the increase in the price of gas calculated using the formula in long-term Gazprom supply contracts, which is tied to the price of oil. That price increased 20% to $237 per 1,000 cubic meters in January 2018, up from $198 in January 2017, according to data published by the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS).In other words, Gazprom's contract price is now nearly equal and perhaps higher than the spot price, which limits the appeal of Russian gas.Given the increase in the export price, revenue from the exports rose approximately 8% in January 2018 year-on-year (based on the calculated contract price).Meanwhile, gas inventories in European underground storage only fell below the 50% mark on January 30 or 8 percentage points higher than on the same day last year. Larger inventories at the end of the heating season will reduce demand for gas to replenish the storage facilities which, together with the price level, could negatively impact Gazprom exports this summer.Gazprom produced 45.6 bcm of gas in January 2018, 3.2% less than in January 2017 but 7.4% more (3.1 bcm more) than in January 2016.EuropeGazprom raised its share of the European gas market to 34.7% in 2017 from 33.1% in 2016, Gazprom in a presentation.""As natural gas consumption on the European market increases, Gazprom's market share is also increasing robustly. Gazprom's supplies once again grew faster than the market in 2017, increasing our market share to a record 34.7%,"" said Gazprom CEO Alexander Medvedev.Norway also succeeded in increasing gas supplies last year. Britain [increased production slightly but] did not increase exports. The drop in supply from the Dutch Groningen field to the European market was offset mainly by supplies from Gazprom, Medvedev said.Kirill Polous, head of the Russian gas giant's Department 123, said: ""In keeping with the latest long-term forecasts by leading analytical agencies [IHS Markit and Wood Mackenzie], the share of has supplied by Gazprom could be 35%-38% by 2030 and rise to 38%-41% by 2035. Such forecasts show that not only Gazprom, but also foreign analysts acknowledge that Russian pipeline gas is highly competitive compared to LNG.""ChinaGazprom may capture 10% of the China's natural gas market by 2025 and supply 13% of the nation's gas needs by 2035, Polous saidThe Chinese market is the most dynamically developing market from the standpoint of both production and consumption, Polous said.""That said, the prospective level of gas production in China is marked by a high degree of uncertainty, primarily due to the potential of shale gas production. Even in the event of significant successes in production of non-traditional gas in the country, which is not likely in current conditions, gas consumption in China will significantly outpace growth of domestic output, leading to further growth in gas imports,"" he said.Forecasts by leading industry analysts put the difference between China's consumption and domestic production of gas, including shale gas, at 200-280 billion cubic meters by 2035.""Presently, we have yet to export gas to China via pipeline, but by 2025, we will be supplying around 10% of the country's consumption, just accounting for shipments under the 'Eastern route' contract. I will recall that the contract envisages annual shipments of 38 million cubic meters of Russia gas to China via the Power of Siberia pipeline, with the first gas due to be shipped less than two years from now, in December of 2019. We don't plan to stop at that and we are currently working with our Chinese partners on new pipeline projects, implementation of which will allow us to increase the presence of Gazprom's gas in China, and as per our expectations, capture 13% of the Chinese natural gas market by 2035,"" Polous said.Medvedev said in his Investor Day remarks that China had raised its 2017 natural gas imports 27% to 95 billion cubic meters, becoming the world's second largest gas importer. Some analysts believe that China may even outpace Japan as the leader in gas imports. According to CNPC estimates, China's gas imports from 2025 to 2030 will grow to 200 billion cubic meters, with an even more ambitious forecast by the Development Research Center of the State Council of China envisaging import growth to 300 billion cubic meters by 2030.""Keeping in mind stable growth in demand for natural gas in China, as well as our unique logistical and resource advantages, we are optimistic not only about Russian gas shipments via the Power of Siberia pipeline, but also regarding the implementation prospects of projects envisaging gas shipments to China from the Russian Far East and via the 'Western route',"" Medvedev said.Gazprom management is confident that negotiations with China on gas supplies from Russia's Far East will go more quickly than negotiations on the first Russian-Chinese gas contract, for supplies along the 'Western Route.'""Work on this contract is going very intensively. A document on the main conditions of this contract was signed quite recently. Taking into account the situation on the Chinese market, the Chinese side is interested in implementing this contract as soon as possible,"" Medvedev said.Speaking about specific timeframes for when exports will begin along this route, he used the usual qualification. ""There is a standard commercial period from when a contract is signed to the start of supplies via pipeline transport. We simply use the rule that before you start extracting gas you first need to sell it. As soon as the price terms are agreed, we will announce a timeframe for the start of supplies,"" Medvedev said.""And I'm confident that in this case the negotiations will take far less time than last time,"" Medvedev said.UkraineUkraine's gas transmission system remains functional only because it is not loaded to capacity, Medvedev said.""Unfortunately, in supplying our European clients, we [have to] rely on the Ukrainian gas transport system. Gazprom's position on the reliability of this route is shared by international experts, including specialists from the Mott MacDonald consulting company. According to their calculations, Ukraine needs to invest $4.8 billion in the system over seven years. In fact, Kyiv is investment only 14%-20% of that figure. In that regard, the Ukrainian corridor can only function because it is loaded at less than 100%,"" he said.Gazprom is consistently conducting a strategy of minimizing transit risks, building new, state-of-the-art gas pipelines and selling additional volumes to our European customers. So, under the Nord Stream 1 project, Gazprom concluded new contracts to supply 20 bcm of gas. The new gas pipeline projects also provide such an ability,"" he said.Gazprom is satisfied with the price that Naftogaz Ukrainy must pay for gas as determined by Stockholm arbitration, Medvedev said.Gazprom will be ready to supply gas once it receives advance payment, he said.U.S.: LNG, sanctionsLNG exportsGazprom does not see U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a competitor to its pipeline gas supplies on the European market in the medium- or long-term future, Polous said.""They have been frightening us for several years with the loss of market positions in Europe, but in the end 2017 closed with another record for exports of Russian pipeline gas and 2018 began with shipments of Russian LNG to the United States (as a result of re-exports from the UK). And we never saw an influx of American LNG into Europe,"" Polous said.""Many of you begin your morning with a cup of coffee. If you compare the volume of Gazprom supplies to the European market to a cup of coffee, supplies of American LNG amount to just a few drops. Obviously, a few drops of coffee are unlikely to wake you up. Just like LNG from the U.S. has not had a significant impact on the diversification of gas supplies and energy security of the European region,"" Polous said at the meeting with investors, which began at 9:00 a.m. local time.A slide in his presentation contrasted Gazprom's ""cup"" with three drops under a magnifying glass to illustrate U.S. LNG exports to Europe.He also said that ""even these negligible amounts of LNG were supplied primarily to countries that did not have access to Russian pipeline gas or the ability to increase supplies of it were limited.""""We also don't expect competition with American LNG on the European market in the long term. Both the high cost of these supplies and our partners' interest in new gas transport pipelines for importing Russian gas into Europe speaks to this,"" Polous said.Since shipments began from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal in the U.S., a little more than 3 billion cubic meters of U.S. gas have been shipped, while Gazprom has delivered more than 350 bcm to its customers in this period, Medvedev said in his report.""And even if you use the analogy of adding not coffee, but cognac to coffee, you would still be unlikely to detect the taste of cognac,"" Medvedev said, picking up on the previous speaker's analogy.""When looking at the price of futures contracts on the TTF to 2022, it's apparent that, according to the current expectations of market players, the full cost of American LNG, taking into account toll payments, will remain significantly higher than the price of gas in Europe. This does not mean that we won't see new volumes of LNG from the U.S. in Europe in future, but presenting American LNG as a game changer on the European market today, at the very least, seems hasty, to put it mildly,"" Medvedev said.SanctionsThe latest U.S. sanctions law, Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), does not apply to Gazprom export projects that are already in implementation, Gazprom said.In addition, less than 1% of Gazprom production falls under U.S. sectoral technology sanctions, according to the presentation.""In August 2017, a law on new sanctions against Russia went into effect in the United States that, among other things, gives the U.S. president the right to impose sanctions against foreign persons who invest in Russian export pipeline projects. However, according to additional official clarifications from the U.S. authorities, projects that began to be implemented before the signing of the law, in other words before August 2, 2017, do not fall under its scope. Therefore, we on our part do not see a significant threat to our current business in connection with sanctions,"" Kruglov said.He said Gazprom is subject to ""one of the mildest versions of sanctions compared to other Russian state companies."" The group's head company, PJSC Gazprom ""does not fall under U.S. and EU financial sanctions"" and is ""successfully working on the international capital market,"" Kruglov said.""Furthermore, we have created a system of control and guarantees that excludes the possibility of using funds raised by Gazprom on international financial markets for the purpose of financing persons and companies subject to sanctions, including Gazprom Neft and Gazprombank,"" Kruglov said.The technology sanctions imposed against Russia's fuel and energy sector, which prohibit the transfer of technology for production in the Arctic, the deepwater shelf and from shale deposits, affect less than one percent of the group's production, he estimated. ""All of these projects at the Gazprom group are not key and involve less than 1% of our production,"" Kruglov said.PIPELINES: Progress across the boardPower of SiberiaGazprom has so built 1,480 kilometers of the 2,158-km linear section of kits Power of Siberia gas pipeline, Kirill Polous, head of the Russian gas giant's Department 123, said.This is more than two-thirds of the pipeline, which will run from the Chayanda field in Yakutia to the Chinese border, construction of which began in 2014 and which will be capable of exporting 38 bcm of gas per year, Polous said.""We built more than 900 km in 2017 alone, beating our original construction schedule by far,"" he said.Nord Stream 2The board of directors of project company Nord Stream 2 AG said last week that the project is fully on schedule and will be launched at the end of 2019, Gazprom Medvedev said.""Obstacles to the project as of today are hypothetical in nature. We know all these risks. These are all hypothetical obstacles. I refer to the new Danish law that could theoretically be used to deny issuance of a permit for construction of the gas pipeline in Danish territorial waters,"" he said.""We are not holding a legal seminar, in order to discuss the legality of passage of such a law, the theoretical application of such a law, whether it accords with EU standards. But, the fact there are political attempts to affect the project, this is well-known,"" Medvedev said.""We proceed on the assumption that reason will prevail and the project will be implemented in all its parts: design, procurement, supply, in full accordance with the schedule,"" Medvedev said.The economic effect of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project on Gazprom's free cash flow and EBITDA could significantly exceed $1 billion per year thanks to complete consolidation and lower transport costs, the Russian gas giant's deputy CEO, Andrei Kruglov said at Investor Day in New York.He recalled that the cost of transporting the same amount of gas through Ukraine exceeds $1.5 billion per year.With the complete consolidation of the pipeline project in Gazprom's financial statements, expenditure items will not reflect the full rate charged, only far lower operating costs, while the investment component in the rate will be replaced by a noncash expenditure item, amortization, Kruglov said.""In terms of generating EBITDA and free cash flow, the investment component will be equal to zero. The component generating profit will be equal to zero. The difference in the full amount will go toward increasing key financial indicators and Gazprom's cash flow,"" Kruglov said.TurkStreamGazprom expects a similar effect, through smaller in scale, from the TurkStream project.Polous said Gazprom had already laid around 800 km of the two TurkStream lines by the beginning of February.TurkStream will consist of two offshore pipelines, both with capacity to transport up to 15.75 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year or 31.5 bcm in total. The offshore section runs approximately 930 kilometers through the Black Sea, from the Russian city of Anapa to the Turkish town of KiyikÃ¶y. Gas transported via the first pipeline is destined for the Turkish market. The other pipeline will be directed towards the Turkish-European border. Work on the offshore section began on May 7, 2017.FINANCES: Investment stabilityGazprom expects annual investment to stabilize at the level 1 trillion rubles or lower once the record investment in 2018 and 2019 (1.4 trillion rubles) has passed.Investment is projected to fall below 1 trillion rubles in 2020 and then rise to about 1.1 trillion rubles a year in 2021-2025. Further on, in the final five years of the 2020s, annual investment is forecast at about 900 billion rubles (according to slides used in the presentation) and to about 800 billion rubles in 2031-2035.""The fact that all three of our megaprojects will be launched at the end of next year accounts for the historically large volume of annual investment over the nearest two years - in the gas business, it will exceed the 'psychological milestone' of one trillion rubles,"" said Kirill Polous, head of the Russian gas giant's Department 123. ""However, the substantial capital that we will invest in this period is a guarantee of the effective and stable growth of the company in the long term, significant growth in volume of gas output and export,"" Polous said.""Going forward, we expect a gradual reduction in the investment burden. In the period to 2035 the annual average demand for investment will not exceed one trillion rubles. This guidance reflects demand for investment in projects which are presently being implemented [the speaker's slides featured Chayanda, Kovytka, Power of Siberia, TurkStream, and the Amur GPP] as well as a series of projects on which no final investment decision has yet been made [Baltic LNG, expansion of Sakhalin-2 and others],"" he said.""By 2035, implementation of these projects will allow us to increase output and exports 35% compared with 2016 levels,"" he said.OIL: Gazprom Neft's strong statisticsGazprom boosted oil production by more than 4% last year, Kruglov said.In listing the factors for further company growth, he said: ""Intensive growth in the oil and gas business, the outlook for future growth. In 2017 as a whole, gas production rose more than 12% and oil more than 4%.""Gazprom's oil business is concentrated in a subsidiary, Gazprom Neft.Gazprom Neft boosted net profit tentatively 45.3% in 2017 to $4.3 billion, the oil company said in materials for an Investor Day presentation by parent company Gazprom.Sales revenue grew 35.7% to $34 billion and EBITDA rose 38.7% to $9.4 billion rubles.Gazprom Neft's progress toward the goal of producing 100 million tonnes of oil will be adjusted somewhat by the OPEC+ agreement to curb oil production, but on the whole this target is achievable, the Russian oil company's CFO, Alexei Yankevich said at Gazprom's Investor Day.Profit predictionsGazprom Neft expects its net profit to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) rose 26.5% in 2017 to 253 billion rubles, the oil producer said in a statement.Sales revenue might have grown more than 18% to 2 trillion rubles.""This growth in key financial metrics in 2017 is due to improved market conditions, the successful development of new initiatives in hydrocarbon production and in increasing retail sales, and effective management initiatives,"" the company said.""Improved operating cash flow and the completion of key infrastructure investments at new upstream projects resulted in free cash flow increasing to 65 billion rubles in 2017,"" it said.Last year ""was a record financial year for Gazprom Neft, with the company achieving the highest net profit in its history,"" said Alexander Dyukov, its CEO. ""The company's operating cash flow throughout last year stood at 422 billion rubles, another record,"" he said.EBITDA could have grown 20.8% to 551 billion rubles and free cash flow of 65 billion rubles is anticipated for 2017.Gazprom Neft plans to maintain capital expenditure to 2020 at roughly last year's level, Kruglov said.""Gazprom's oil business [represented by Gazprom Neft] is developing dynamically. Gazprom Neft has passed through the peak period of investment in production projects. Such major projects as Prirazlomnoye and Novoportovskoye have already been launched. That said, plans are to maintain capital investment at roughly last year's level, and key projects will be associated with modernization of refining capacity,"" he said.Gazprom Neft's investment program totaled 385 billion rubles in 2017 and is at the same level in 2018.""In the oil business, which contributes over 25% of EBITDA, Gazprom Neft is in the middle of the growth cycle and, in our opinion, is the best growth story in the history of the Russian oil industry,"" Kruglov said.New projectsGazprom Neft calculates that its new projects, upon reaching peak production, will provide a combined total of up to 28 million tonnes of oil a year, the oil major said in materials presented during Investor Day at parent company Gazprom.Gazprom Neft does not provide a schedule of production from the new projects, which are currently at varying stages of study and development.On average, Gazprom Neft is expecting to launch commercial production within new projects in 2018-2024. The Yamburg project, where the license is held by Gazprom and Gazprom Neft is the operator, is slated to begin production in 2023, with peak production of 6 million tonnes; the Tazovsky (Tazov) block and Severo-Samburgskoye (North Samburg) deposits in 2021 with peak production of 1 million tonnes at each of the deposits; the group of remote deposits in 2018 with a peak of 2 million tonnes; the Chonsky (Chon) project in 2024 with peak production of 6 million tonnes; and the Zapadno-Zimneye (West Zimneye) field in 2020 with a peak of 2 million tonnes. Gazprom Neft will begin production at SPD's Southern hub as part of its JV with Shell in 2020 with peak production of 2 million tonnes and will launch production at Evrotek-Yugra fields within its JV with Repsol the same year with peak production of 3 million tonnes.The new offshore project, the Ayashsky (Ayash) block, within which the company discovered the large Neptune oil deposit, is expected to launch commercial production in 2027, with peak production of 6 million tonnes. Earlier information suggested that Gazprom Neft is planning to prepare a detailed estimate of oil reserves at the Neptune deposit by mid-2018 and continue follow-up exploration only in 2019. Existing road maps envisage production at the Netune deposit beginning in 2025-2027.Gazprom Neft has also posted production figures for large new projects already launched. Thus, production at the Prirazlomnoye field in 2017 was 53,000 barrels per day (bpd), with a 2018 forecast of 72,000 bpd and a 2019 forecast of 83,000 bpd. The Novoport field produced 120,000 bpd in 2017, with forecasts of 137,000 bpd in 2018 and 159,000 bpd in 2019. Output at Messoyakha in 2017 was 63,000 bpd, with forecasts of 88,000 bpd for 2018 and 109,000 bpd for 2019.ReservesGazprom Neft had PRMS reserves totaling 2.781 billion tonnes of oil equivalent at the end of 2017, 2.2% more than a year earlier, according to materials presented at Investor Day.Probable PRMS reserves increased 4.48% to 1.259 billion tonnes of oil equivalent and proved reserves were up 0.5% to 1.522 billion tonnes.Hydrocarbon production increased 4.1% in 2016 to 89.8 million tonnes of oil equivalent.Refining declined 4.2% to 40.1 million tonnes.CIS, BALTIC and international NEWSUkrnaftoburinnia seeks to increase drilling to six new wells in 2018KYIV. Feb 1 (Interfax) - Private joint-stock company Ukrnaftoburinnia, which is among top three largest private gas producers in the country, plans to drill at least six new wells in 2018 compared with four drilled in 2017, the company's press service reported on Wednesday.Ukrnaftoburinnia Head Mykhailo Bakunenko said that the company plans to boost pro-duction by 40-50% in 2018. Last year the efficient level of production at wells that were placed to the idle fund or were inefficient was restored.Gas production by the company in 2017 grew by 50.6% or 131 million cubic meters com-pared with 2016, to 390 million cubic meters. Production of oil and gas condensate rose by 48.3% or 14,000 tonnes, to 43,000 tonnes.Gas sales by the company grew to 850 million cubic meters compared with 445 million cubic meters in 2016. Sales of oil and condensate increased to 48,500 tonnes compared with 32,400 tonnes.CIS, BALTIC and international NEWSWinner of tender to use Odesa Port-Side Plant on tolling basis not supplying enough gas, debt to Ukrtransgaz growingKYIV. Feb 5 (Interfax) - All-Ukrainian Energo Company LLC, which won a tender to use the production facilities of Odesa Port-Side Plant on a tolling basis, is not supplying enough gas for operations to the chemical enterprise, Ukrtransgaz, the operator of the Ukrainian gas transport system (GTS), reported.""On January 25, 2017, Ukrtransgaz received a monthly application (nominated in January) from the customer for the services of All-Ukrainian Energo Company LLC for the trans-portation of 3 million cubic meters of natural gas for the needs of the Odesa Port-Side Plant and a message from the plant about the resumption of production. In January, con-sumption amounted to 9.6 million cubic meters of gas, which means that the submitted applications cover its actual consumption by only a third,"" the company said.According to Ukrtransgaz, in the February application All-Ukrainian Energo Company in-dicated a volume of 9.6 million cubic meters, while the approximate monthly demand of the Odesa Port-Side Plant in gas is about 60 million cubic meters.According to the Ukrainian legislation, if the actual gas consumption exceeds applications, the consumer should refund the cost of the fuel difference to Ukrtransgaz as a fee for bal-ancing. When the debt appears, the consumer is disconnected from gas supplies, but in the case of the Odesa Port-Side Plant, this is not possible.""The Pechersky district court, by its decision dated March 28, 2017 in case No. 757/16733/17-c, forbade Ukrtransgaz from stopping/restricting the transportation of natu-ral gas to the Odesa Port-Side Plant due to non-payment of the existing debt before the fi-nal decision in the court lawsuits related to the recovery of this debt. The court hearings are underway and the final decision has not yet been taken in them,"" Ukrtransgaz said.As of the end of January, the total debt of the Odesa Port-Side Plant to Ukrtransgaz in-creased to UAH 473.3 million (including UAH 434 million for balancing services and UAH 39.3 million for transportation services).""Thus, the Odesa Port-Side Plant is the largest debtor of Ukrtransgaz among Ukrainian in-dustrial enterprises,"" Ukrtransgaz said.CIS, BALTIC and international NEWSGazprom, Turkmenistan still not negotiating gas supplies, contacts possible towards end-2018MOSCOW. Feb 7 (Interfax) - Gazprom and Turkmenistan are still not in talks to resume gas supplies, with fresh contacts possible towards the end of the year, when a pause in the contract and arbitration proceedings come to an end, Deputy Russian Energy Minister An-atoly Yanovsky told reporters.""Not as far as I know. We signed the pause and this is in effect. There are no talks. It's too soon right now to talk about any negotiations, [but there might be contact] close to the end of the pause,"" he said.Since January 2016, Gazprom has completely stopped purchases of Turkmen gas having bought 2.8 bcm in 2015. The Turkmen gas sector has yet to offset the negative effect of this.Gazprom had been trying since the 2008 crisis to revise the price of Turkmen gas it was buying. Starting in 2009, Gazprom had bought around 10 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas per year from Turkmenistan, but said it would curtail those purchases to 4 bcm in 2015.

A study finds consumers would benefit from a change in U.S. oil policy. The study examines the effects of ending the decade-long ban on exporting U.S. crude oil. There's been a ban since the Arab oil embargo of 1970s. NPR's John Ydstie reports.JOHN YDSTIE: Jason Bordoff is a co-author of the study. He's a former energy adviser in the Obama White House and now directs the Columbia University Center on Global Energy Policy. He says convincing consumers and politicians to end the export ban on crude is not an easy sell.JASON BORDOFF: People worry that allowing oil exports may lead to higher pump prices. Kind of intuitively, you might think we're sending our oil overseas, there's less for us or we'll have to pay more for it.YDSTIE: But Bordoff says evidence and economic theory suggest that ending the export ban would put downward pressure on gasoline prices. The reason is that U.S. consumers haven't been getting the full benefit of low U.S. crude prices.BORDOFF: Because the price consumers are paying for gasoline is being set by the world price of oil, not by the U.S. price.YDSTIE: And during most of the past few years, the world price has been well above the U.S. price - as much as $20 a barrel higher. That happened partly because of a 60 percent surge in U.S. oil production that led to an oversupply of crude on the U.S. market that couldn't be exported. So a gap opened between the price of U.S. crude and the global price of oil. But U.S. consumers didn't see much benefit according to Bordoff.BORDOFF: To the extent there's any discount on the U.S. price compared to the world price that is a benefit that accrues to refiners, not to consumers.YDSTIE: So not surprisingly, says Bordoff, refiners are lobbying hard to continue the export ban.BORDOFF: I think if you were a refiner, you'd rather buy your crude cheaper if you could.YDSTIE: And independent oil refiners take issue with the collusion of Bordoff's study. Jay Hauck is the executive director of the organization called CRUDE.JAY HAUCK: The oil export ban benefits consumers. It benefits businesses in the United States. It has very broad and deep support, and it also has a very strong national security component.YDSTIE: Hauck points to a study by Barclays that argues that refiners did pass to consumers most of the savings they enjoyed from processing lower-cost U.S. crude in recent years. And Hauck says the export ban protects U.S. energy security.HAUCK: It helps insulate the United States from volatility and unpredictable global crude markets.YDSTIE: Including market manipulation by OPEC.HAUCK: For us to simply unilaterally disarm seems unwise.YDSTIE: But Bordoff argues that by lifting the export ban and becoming a bigger player in the oil market, the U.S. will gain influence over global prices. He also says lifting the ban would give the U.S. more credibility on global trade issues.BORDOFF: Allowing traded energy is consistent with our past and our present U.S. trade policy priorities.YDSTIE: The U.S. already allows exports of products like gasoline. And the Obama administration recently loosened the crude export ban a bit by allowing exports of lightly processed crude called condensate. But opposition from environmentalists who say lifting the ban would promote more fossil fuel use is constraining further White House action. Big oil producers have lobbied hard to eliminate the ban, but they're concerned they don't yet have enough support in the Congress to win. So a vote on lifting the ban on crude oil exports could be a ways off. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.Copyright of Morning Edition (NPR) is the property of National Public Radio, Inc.

Top energy stock  Jagged Peak Energy (JAG) is shaping a potential buy point.The IPO Leader competes with the likes of Concho Resources (CXO) and Diamondback Energy (FANG) in the southern Delaware sub-basin of the Permian production area.With a highest-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, Jagged Peak is the No. 1-ranked stock in the Oil & Gas U.S. Exploration and Production industry group. The Composite Rating blends key fundamental and technical metrics to gauge a stock's quality.Rounding out the top three stocks in the group are Energen (EGN) and Parsley Energy (PE). Both are pulling back to their 10-week lines after recent breakouts.Jagged Peak's industry group is ranked No. 9 out of 197 groups, moving up from No. 56 six weeks ago.According to RBC Capital Markets, potential catalysts include spacing tests between wells at Whiskey River and Cochise — two of the company's areas in the Southern Delaware basin located in West Texas. Positive results from this testing could add up to 400 locations to the company's inventory.Quarterly earnings results are due out May 11 before the market open. Consensus estimates show earnings growth of 100% to 10 cents per share on revenue of $117.7 million.There's also a new CEO at the helm. In March, Joseph Jaggers retired and James Kleckner, an independent director of the company, became the newest CEO.Since its IPO on Jan. 27, the new issue has yet to maintain a solid uptrend, despite two separate breakouts. Now, the stock is shaping a cup-with-handle base with a 15.08 buy point.A big weakness is the stock's relative strength line — painted in blue on every MarketSmith chart — which tumbled in the first quarter. It remains well off its former highs. Look for that to improve if the market is able to right itself.According to the IBD Stock Checkup, the stock is seeing solid institutional demand. It has a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a 1.4 up/down volume ratio. For comparison, a neutral up/down reading is 1.0.RELATED:Ferrari Plus These IBD 50 Names To Report: Investing Action PlanTop Retail Name Fends Off Industry Weakness And Is Near A Buy PointThe 'Apple Of Oil' Near Buy Point Ahead Of Earnings After The CloseEnergy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalIPO Stock News And Analysis: Find Today's Top New IssuesGraph: https://research.investors.com/ibdchartswp.aspx?cht=pvc&type=daily&symbol=JAGBy SCOTT LEHTONENCopyright of Investors Business Daily is the property of Investor's Business Daily and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

The closing of the acquisition is expected to occur on or about January 1, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.   “We believe that this transaction strengthens our position as one of the leading refined products terminaling and transportation service providers in the country,” said Fred Boutin, Chief Executive Officer of TransMontaigne Partners. “The West Coast Facilities are strategically located within the San Francisco Bay Area refining complex, one of the largest refining complexes in North America. These terminals and their fee-based cash flows are well-aligned with our existing business model, and are backed by agreements with customers that include many of the largest, most-recognizable refining, refining logistics and merchant trading companies in the world. This acquisition, combined with the organic growth we have executed this year, supports and extends our commitment to deliver stable and growing distributions over the long-term.”   The West Coast Facilities include two waterborne refined product and crude oil terminals with a total of 64 storage tanks with approximately 5.4 million barrels of storage capacity. The facilities have extensive connectivity to domestic and international refined product and crude oil markets through significant marine, pipeline, truck and rail capabilities. The facilities are supported by multi-year, fee-based agreements with contract terms of up to 5 years. The purchase price reflects a less than ten times multiple of the Partnership’s estimate of the 2018 EBITDA attributable to the West Coast Facilities based on current customer contracts and historical and anticipated activity levels, revenues and operating costs. The Partnership cautions that it cannot provide any assurance that the West Coast Facilities will achieve this anticipated level of EBITDA.

No Offer or Solicitation   This communication is for informational purposes only and shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities pursuant to the proposed transactions or otherwise, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which the offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.   Forward-Looking Statements   This press release includes statements that may constitute forward-looking statements for federal securities laws. Although the Partnership believes that the expectations related to the West Coast Facilities reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including, (i) the successful integration and performance of the acquired assets, (ii) the ability to obtain required permits and other approvals on a timely basis; (iii) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions, and (iv) competitive factors such as pricing pressures and the entry of new competitors. Additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Partnership’s expectations and may adversely affect its business and results of operations are disclosed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 14, 2017. The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and, other than as may be required by securities law, the Partnership undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.   Non-GAAP Financial Measure   EBITDA   EBITDA is not a computation based upon generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. As used above, EBITDA means earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is presented here because it is a widely accepted financial indicator and used to compare performance of the acquired assets. The Partnership believes that EBITDA provides investors an enhanced perspective of the expected operating performance of the West Coast Facilities. It is not practical to provide a reconciliation of forecasted EBITDA for the year 2018 to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net earnings, because certain items cannot be reasonably estimated or predicted at this time. Any of those items could be significant to the West Coast Facilities’ financial results.

With WTI pricing accounting for over 25% of global supply, the DICO futures contract will provide access to the Indian energy markets for a wider range of participants.The contracts genetic makeup embeds the strong fundamentals of trading energy products across global liquidity pools and on DGCX come with the added benefit of intra commodity margin benefits on up to 100%.The DICO futures will be cash settled, trading from Monday to Friday during the usual Exchange trading hours (7:00am – 11:55pm).The Exchange also revised the contract specifications of 9 Single Stock Futures (SSFs) which include 6 Indian stocks and 3 US stocks. The revisions include changes in the contract multiplier which creates an equitable notional value of 5000 USD and effects cost rationalization across the SSF contracts making the contracts even more appealing across the vibrant retail trading community.DGCX SSFs contracts, comprising of 5 US and 10 Indian stocks, were listed in January 2016 to enable local and regional investors to take advantage of hedging opportunities in global equities while trading locally on a regulated, transparent Exchange.Copyright 2016 by Emirates News Agency Distributed by UPICopyright of Arabia 2000 is the property of Arabia 2000.

The results are unaudited and subject to revision, according to a source quoted by the newspaper.The company's activities range from operating oil refineries to fuel services.Turnover fell to $152 billion as oil prices averaged about $45 per barrel, down from $168 billion in 2015 when crude prices averaged more than $52.The volumes of crude and oil-derived products traded by Vitol increased by 16 per cent to 2.6 billion barrels, an average of more than seven million per day. Crude oil, the largest part of Vitol's business, accounted for 48 per cent of its traded barrel volumes.Ian Taylor, Vitol's chairman and chief executive, said that its performance had been ""solid, despite challenging market conditions"". Its global operations also encompass oil production, refineries, storage terminals, fuel service stations and other investments. It has 40 offices worldwide and 250 ships transporting cargo at any time. Vitol said that it made 6,809 ship journeys last year, up from 6,629 in 2015.

0,"Bismarck Tribune, The (ND). 03/21/2017.",Article,,,,2W63996960200,Newspaper Source,Gas prices remain steady amid crude oil surplus,"Jessica Holdman     March 21--With a record-high amount of crude oil on the market and in storage, North Dakota drivers have yet to see prices jump at the pump.     The average price for a gallon of regular gas in the state usually increases about 35 cents between Feb. 1 and April 1 as refineries begin seasonal maintenance and make the switch to summer blend fuels, according to AAA North Dakota. Prices also typically rise another 15 cents or more leading to Memorial Day.     But Monday's state average is the same as it was a month ago -- $2.28 per gallon of regular unleaded.     ""The oil market is under pressure, and U.S. inventories continue to build, despite OPEC efforts to reduce supply,"" said Gene LaDoucer, North Dakota spokesman for AAA-The Auto Club Group. ""This has resulted in the delay of the customary seasonal gas price spike. Gas prices could drop in the short term, but the downward trend may only be temporary.""     LaDoucer said, while gasoline demand has been sluggish for the year, it has risen and total gasoline supplies have fallen, according to the Energy Information Agency. This would normally push gas prices higher but it hasn't been enough to outweigh falling crude oil prices.     Prices in Bismarck on Monday, at $2.33 per gallon, were higher than the state average, but stayed steady compared to a month ago.     Both state and Bismarck averages were higher than a year ago, when the average prices for a gallon of regular unleaded were $1.98 and $2.02 respectively.     The average in Fargo on Monday was $2.14 per gallon and the average in Grand Forks was $2.29 per gallon.     The national average was at $2.29 per gallon.     ""Gas prices will likely move higher as we approach Memorial Day, but it's too early to say how much increase to expect,"" LaDoucer said.

E&Ps are adding to their holdings in a half-dozen top-notch shale and tight-oil plays, jettisoning assets in less-profitable areas, and striving like never before to optimize the efficiency of their drilling and production.  This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170323005354/en/ Surviving and Thriving in a $50/bbl Crude Oil World (Graphic: Business Wire)   Despite predictions of widespread bankruptcies and credit defaults after the plunge in oil prices in late 2014, most of the upstream industry weathered the crisis remarkably well through high-grading of portfolios, impressive capital discipline, and an intense focus on operational efficiencies.   “What we are seeing today is quite different from the major industry consolidations that have followed other price downturns,” noted RBN President Rusty Braziel. “Much of this cycle has been characterized by transactions in which E&Ps are concentrating their assets, building out significant contiguous acreage positions in their core operating areas while generating funds for operations and acquisitions through equity offerings, debt refinancing and sales of non-core assets. The strongest and most aggressive of upstream companies have been behaving like schools of piranha, eating away at small pieces of other companies in hundreds of transactions that are simultaneously fragmenting and reconstituting the U.S. E&P sector.”   This revolutionary development begs a number of important questions: How will the newly transformed E&P sector perform? Where will E&Ps invest? Which companies will be successful and which will fall by the wayside? How will these companies impact world oil and gas markets?   To answer these and many more questions, RBN Energy has joined with Oil & Gas Financial Analytics to create a new market study titled Piranha! The “Piranhaization” of U.S. E&Ps. This study provides an in-depth analysis of the reconstituted E&P sector, and covers 43 U.S. E&Ps that are most representative of the U.S. upstream industry. Collectively, these companies produce about half of total U.S. oil and gas output, and have a total enterprise value of over $650 billion.   Piranha! is a 150-page assessment of today’s E&P industry trends, strategies, and individual company financial performance. Among various topics, the analysis examines U.S. upstream M&A activity and capital investment (CAPEX) spending plans by the 43 companies to determine how aggressive they are planning to be. The market study then presents a “Financial Strength Analysis,” which evaluates companies on two metrics: financial position and equity valuation.   The winners in this industry-wide transformation will be the companies that:   1. Adopt strategies to maximize investment returns by focusing on their core operating areas   2. Maintain strong balance sheets that will enable them to weather future commodity price downturns   3. Demonstrate the ability to execute through adoption of new technologies, effective operations, and prudent acreage acquisitions   For more information, please visit www.RBNenergy.com, call (281) 819-1983, or email sales@rbnenergy.com.

Several critical factors being presented include the area's rising gas production, limited pipeline capacity, and a rising number of producers from their markets.",1220,130198154,Regional Business News,"Permian Oil Prices Dive As Gas Prices Rise, Boosting These Refiners.","Oil prices for crude produced in West Texas' Permian basin have fallen off sharply over the past two months. The area's rising production is backing up, bottlenecked by limited pipeline capacity. The result is blocking a rising number of producers from their markets.The localized glut is carving into shale producers' sales. But it's been a boon to many refiners -- particularly those near the Permian, which process the crude into gasoline and other finished products.The International Energy Agency believes take-away capacity from the Permian fields will ""become insufficient by midyear, with a deficit possibly reaching as much as 290,000 barrels a day during the first half of 2019.""Pipeline operators are scrambling to bring capacity online to deal with that quarter-million barrel-a-day deficit. But until they do, backed-up production is quickly building a localized oil glut.""The biggest thing that's just crazy for refiners are the wide crude differentials,"" said Jennifer Rowland, a senior analyst covering refiners for Edward Jones.The top U.S. oil price benchmark, West Texas Intermediate priced at the Cushing, Okla., hub traded near $65 a barrel on Friday. That was a bit less than $10 below Europe's Brent crude benchmark.WTI priced at Midland, Texas -- just outside El Paso and about 500 miles closer to the Permian -- traded more than $9 below the Cushing price.That price difference ""goes right into the pocket of the refiners,"" Rowland said. ""That's going to be a significant boost to earnings in the second-quarter.""Analysts expect HollyFrontier's (HFC) Q2 earnings to soar 142% while Phillips 66's (PSX) earnings are seen doubling in Q2.""Refiners, especially in the Permian, that are producing gasoline and distillate in El Paso have the closest proximity to where the crude is produced,"" said Craig Weiland, executive director at U.S. Capital Advisors. Marathon Petroleum  (MPC) is well positioned in the region after spending $23.3 billion buying El Paso's Western Refining from Andeavor (ANDV), formerly called Tesoro, last month.""In the short term, a stock like HollyFrontier, stands to benefit from the pronounced Permian discount, which we think will last until 2019,"" Weiland said.Rowland agrees. She doesn't expect the wide differentials to narrow anytime soon as pipeline capacity remains constrained through 2019.In an April note, Tudor, Pickering, Holt was especially bullish on Delek U.S. (DK) ""which can run (as much as) 70% Midland crude in its four-refinery system.""A Barclays report from earlier this month, said that Delek gets 78% of its oil from the Permian while HollyFrontier gets 39% and CVR Refining (CVRR) gets 14%.East coast refiners like Phillips 66 can still benefit from the differentials if they have transportation capacity. The company ships Permian crude in tankers from the Gulf Coast to its refineries in Philadelphia.Phillips 66 and PBF Energy (PBF) are also looking at shipping by rail as pipeline bottlenecks increase.However, American drivers shouldn't rejoice quite yet. Discounted WTI crude doesn't necessarily translate to price relief at the gas pump.During years when U.S. oil production was declining, gasoline prices came to be based on what then was the more stable international Brent crude benchmark. So as gasoline prices creep to three-year highs, some well-positioned U.S. refiners may be seeing a windfall from the Permian, but they aren't likely to pass that benefit on to consumers.Saudi Arabia and Russia have begun to increase production, despite the almost 2-year-old agreement to limit output in order sop up the world's oil supply glut. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia, and other producers will meet June 22 in order to discuss a possible end to the production cap arrangement. All things being equal, more output from OPEC and Russia should place downward pressure on global oil prices.But at the same time, oil prices have been pressured higher by a deepening economic crisis in Venezuela. The impoverished country's collapse has tightened its already constrained crude output. In addition, President Trump's exit from the Iran nuclear deal, and the renewed sanctions on Tehran have sparked new supply concerns.Americans may grumble about rising gasoline prices. Gas averaged about $2.90 per gallon across the U.S. on Wednesday. That was up 25% from a year ago, but still far below the $4 level -- above which consumer demand finally starts to weaken.Gasoline ""demand is relatively inelastic,"" Weiland said. ""Consumers will pay generally the price of gasoline without changing consumption habits.""The Energy Information Administration estimates that gas prices will be 14% higher, on average, during the summer driving season than they were last year, rising to $2.74 on average per gallon.Research from AAA projects the average driver will pay $225 to $250 more this summer for gasoline vs. last summer.Rowland said the higher gasoline prices may potentially ding the retail margins at Phillips 66 and other refiners with retail operations.""But the retail impact will be so muted relative to the benefit they would be receiving on refining side. It is a headwind for them,"" she said.Through the first quarter, exploration and production companies continued to top earnings expectations, generally by wide margins. The industry's profit outlook remains strong through the remainder of the year.But refiners offer investors another angle into the oil patch, one with significant short-term upside potential. The refining group ranked No. 38 on Wednesday among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD. That is up from No. 118 at the end of the first quarter.With the group, shares of HollyFrontier have a 42% gain for the year through Wednesday. CVR is up 37%, while Delek U.S. and PBF Energy are up more than 32% apiece. All three of the stocks are extended.Thinly traded Cheniere Energy Partners (CQH), a limited partnership formed by Cheniere Energy (LNG), is the top-ranked stock in the group, based on IBD's Composite Rating. Cheniere exports liquefied natural gas from its Sabine Pass terminal on the border of Texas and Louisiana.Cheniere Energy is currently in a buy range above a flat-base buy point of 29.83. Its dividend currently yields 7.5%. Phillips and Delek could be poised for rebounds from support at their 10-week moving averages.Federal regulations are not a happy subject among refiners. But an international marine fuel mandate is providing the U.S. industry with an unexpected headwind vs. their international counterparts.To cut down on emissions, the U.N. International Maritime Organization mandated that marine fuel sulfur content be reduced to below 0.5% in 2020. The current allowable limit is 3.5%.Marine fuel demand accounts for 4 million barrels per day, Rowland says, only a small portion of global demand for refined products. But analysts expect most of the high-sulfur fuel demand to shift to the more refined, lower-sulfur marine gasoil distillate.""The higher demand for distillate really plays into the hands of U.S. refiners that have sophisticated refineries that produce more distillate,"" Rowland said.The mandate will also cause demand for heavier fuels to fall and the differentials between the more processed distillate and heavier fuels will rise, adding to the boost U.S. refiners will see.Rowland said the change could cause a $5 per barrel increase in those margins, as well as a $1 per barrel slip in heavy crudes. Valero and Marathon will see the biggest benefit. Rowland projects earnings for those two rising 30% in 2020, based on her forecasts, with a 25% gain for Phillips 66.U.S. refiners are also likely to benefit from the Trump administration's relaxed stance on the Renewable Fuel Standard. But the White House faces a juggling act as it tries to appease both corn farmers and blue-collar refinery workers. The 2005 mandate requires 10% plant-based ethanol be added to gasoline and diesel.Smaller refineries with capacity of 75,000 barrels per day or less can apply for waivers to that rule. But larger companies have taken advantage of certain loopholes.""What was once a headwind, is now a tailwind,"" Rowland said of the Renewable Fuel Standard.Scott Pruitt's Environmental Protection Agency has approved 29 out of the 30 waiver requests received through April, including requests from massive integrated oil companies Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX).Not only are more refiners getting waivers, companies are getting back-pay for past waiver rejections.HollyFrontier and Sinclair Oil were awarded over $30 million in retroactive biofuel waivers in May. This followed a 2017 court ruling that found the Obama administration had wrongly denied waiver requests in 2015.Looking forward, the meeting between OPEC and Russia to discuss production increases are the next big blip on oil industry radar. But even if the outcome pressures prices lower, refiners are most likely looking at a continued rebound in profitability.""Refiners are going to do well regardless of commodity prices, Rowland said. ""It's hard to see how it can really fall apart. What would ruin them would have to be significant demand erosion.""She said the industry does face long-term headwinds from the rise of alternative fuels, electric and hybrid vehicles, and stricter traditional fuel standards, but those are outside the immediate investment horizon as the positives far outweigh the negatives.""Those are long-term headwinds outside the immediate investment horizon and are far outweighed by positives in the space,"" Rowland said.By GILLIAN RICHCopyright of Investors Business Daily is the property of Investor's Business Daily and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

The Santa Maria Refinery Rail Project, on the Nipomo Mesa adjacent to Highway 1 in southern San Luis Obispo County, called for bringing in crude oil, possibly of the heavy, tar sands variety, from out of state via a 1.3-mile rail spur connecting the refinery with the Union Pacific mainline.     Rail access to the Santa Maria refinery from outside the area would be from the south via the Los  Angeles basin and from the north along Amtrak's Capitol Corridor through East and South Bay shoreline cities, including Richmond, Berkeley, Oakland, Fremont and San Jose.     The San Luis Obispo County Planning Commission rejected the project in October. Phillips 66 appealed that decision to the county Board of Supervisors, which voted 3-1 on Tuesday to reject the project.     ""This is a huge victory for public safety, health and California's environment,"" Valerie Love of the Center for Biological Diversity said in a news release Tuesday.     ""Our communities will be safer and our air will be cleaner because of it,"" she added.     A Phillips 66 spokesman, Rich Johnson, said, ""We presented a strong proposal and will review the concerns raised today.  We will also consider all of our options.""     The company previously has challenged the county's standing to evaluate Union Pacific mainline issues, including possible effects on the communities it traverses, holding that they fall under federal regulations.     The company has said the rail spur project is needed to counter declining oil production in California and that it would keep the refinery in operation and provide local jobs and taxes.

The imports  met 50 per cent of the Kingdom's diesel needs,  42 per cent of gasoline needs and 100 per cent of jet fuel and kerosene needs, while the rest was imported by the three main fuel companies -- Total Jordan, Manaseer Oil & Gas and the JPRC's Jordan Petroleum Products Marketing Company.     The committee said on Friday that of each 159-litre crude oil barrel, 30 per cent is refined into diesel, 20 per cent into gasoline, 10 per cent into jet fuel, 3 per cent each into kerosene and gas, 28 per cent into fuel oil and 6 per cent into asphalt.     When deciding the monthly prices of fuel products, the committee said it depends on the average international price of oil derivatives, not crude oil, over 30 days, with a mechanism approved by the government in 2008 that includes costs of shipment, handling and taxes.     The latest hike to gasoline prices included a 30 fils increase to support the Treasury under ""economic correction measures"" recently taken by the government.     Last June, the government also decided to impose a fixed Treasury allowance on all fuel products amounting to 25 fils per litre, in line with Jordan's agreement with the International Monetary Fund.     ___     (c)2017 the Jordan Times (Amman, Jordan)     Visit the Jordan Times (Amman, Jordan) at www.jordantimes.com     Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.Copyright of Jordan Times (3/2006 to 4/2009) is the property of Jordan Times (3/2006 to 4/2009).

""It's proportionate to the cash flow,"" Neveu said.""So if (a drilling customer) expected a netback of $50 Canadian or $55 or $60 and they're only getting $45 or $50, they'll adjust back to that outlook quickly, within the quarter,"" Neveu added.He said the drilling industry in Canada is headed for revenue this year in line with 2017, which was the second-worst year for drilling profitability after a disastrous 2016.Earlier, Doug Suttles, CEO of Encana Corp. said government policy is making Canada an uncompetitive place to drill for oil and gas.""Today, every well we drill in British Columbia, we pay over $100,000 in carbon tax just on the diesel used to drill and complete that well,"" he said during a speech at the conference.""Those products are largely moving to markets in the United States.""In the United States, we don't pay a dollar of carbon tax.""Calgary-based Encana is focused on four major oil and gas plays, the Montney and Duvernay in Western Canada and the Eagle Ford and Permian in the southern United States.Suttles said Encana gets no credit for the clean-burning natural gas it produces, nor for the three B.C. gas plants it built that are powered by hydro electricity.He added it also won't get credit if the gas is shipped in future to a hydro electricity-powered liquefied natural gas export terminal on the West Coast and on to Asia, where it may replace coal in producing electricity and cutting global emissions.Due to corporate tax cuts under U.S. President Donald Trump, Suttles pointed out Encana also pays higher income taxes in Canada than it does in the U.S.""As a Canadian, it's easy to get really down,"" said Ian Dundas, CEO of Enerplus Corp., a Calgary-based company with 90 per cent of its production in North Dakota and little in Canada.""We've let the Americans outcompete us and outregulate us and we find ourselves in this position.""Copyright of Toronto Star (Canada) is the property of Toronto Star.

Dr. Matar Al Neyhadi Undersecretary for the UAE Ministry of Energy delivered the opening keynote pointing to the investments conducted by ADNOC on all levels.In his keynote on the company's behalf, Abdulla Salem Al Dhaheri ADNOC Marketing and Refining Director underscored the significance to focus on identifying and maximizing value across the value chain in the upstream, downstream and petrochemicals sectors; empowering the company to adjust in facing and coping with global crude oil markets' fluctuations.“ADNOC aims to increase the production capacity of refined products and will produce new products such as Base Oil Group II and Group III, Carbon Black and Petroleum Coke following the expansion of the Ruwais refinery,” said Al Dhaheri. “The objective is to continue meeting the rising domestic demand, as well as to further enhance our presence in the international markets,” he added.When it comes to markets' fluctuations, Al Dhaheri said that oil markets would remain volatile in the short term, but would eventually recover, adding: “the likelihood of US$ 50 a barrel as average for the year 2016 is achievable ( ) despite the lack of consensus between OPEC members and non-OPEC producers in Doha recently, we see that market forces are beginning to have their intended impact.”“We must be resilient and agile to adjust to fickle market conditions. Oil markets will regain their balance in the second half of this year as supply from non-OPEC producers will decline and the overhang in the markets will be met by rising oil demand,” added Al Dhaheri.The conference and alongside week program will continue till the end of the week with participation from wide range of senior representatives from ADNOC mentioned directorate. In addition, senior representatives from ADNOC companies such as Abu Dhabi Oil Refining Company (Takreer), Abu Dhabi Gas Development Company Ltd. (Al Hosn Gas) and Ruwais Fertiliser Industries (Fertil) are taking part, along their counterparts from leading oil and gas companies, especially in areas of refining, marketing, transport, shipping and petrochemicals.Copyright 2016 by Emirates News Agency Distributed by UPICopyright of Arabia 2000 is the property of Arabia 2000.

0,All Things Considered (NPR). 08/14/2015.,Transcript,,,,6XN201508142111,Newspaper Source,Small Texas City Feels Pain Of Falling Crude Oil Prices.,"MELISSA BLOCK: Oil prices took another plunge this week, falling below $43 a barrel. That's less than half last year's price. Consumers in much of the country are benefiting, but not all, and we'll get to that in a moment. The downside of low prices also means tough times for oil companies and their workers. Mose Buchele of member station KUT reports from a south Texas town where nearly everyone is feeling the pain of low oil prices.MOSE BUCHELE: Carlos Garcia grew up in the south Texas oils fields in a small town called Alice, Texas. He was raised with the ups and downs of the oil business.CARLOS GARCIA: My dad was a roughneck himself. He was a driller years back in the '80s.BUCHELE: That was during the last big Texas boom. The bus came to Alice around '83. The reasons were the same as today. Oil wasn't worth the cost of drilling for it.GARCIA: And when it did hit rock-bottom back then, we lost out. My dad lost his home he had just built, and I lived through it.BUCHELE: Eventually, things picked back up. Garcia followed in his dad's footsteps. He worked on oil derricks and did well. But that was up until last year when prices dropped. He lost his job. He lost his truck. He says he's going to lose his car next.GARCIA: I'm looking for a little work. My wife is working a part-time job. It ain't making the bill, you know?BUCHELE: So he's got to scrimp and save.GARCIA: Pinch every penny we've got, and we'll just eat here and eat at my mom's.BUCHELE: When he says eat here, he's talking about the Alice Food Pantry, a local charity. It's a busy operation off the old Main Street. Volunteers push creaky carts of canned goods, bread and tortillas from a small warehouse to cars waiting in the alley. Bonnie Whitley runs the place. She's seeing more people like Garcia here - first-time visitors.BONNIE WHITLEY: Men come in, which is very unusual. Usually the women come in.BUCHELE: She thinks they need more than free food.WHITLEY: A lot of people are in depression right now and in denial. They just - they can't come to grips with what's happened.TANYA HINOJOSA: My name is Tanya Hinojosa, and I'm a waitress. I've been serving tables for the past 15 years.BUCHELE: You remember Carlos Garcia said his family's been eating in? So have a lot of families. Hinojosa used to pull in $65 to $100 a day in tips. Now, she's sometimes clearing just 25 bucks, so she biked to the Pantry for some food.HINOJOSA: I have never, ever made $25 in a day. It's always been more than that.BUCHELE: She and her kids have moved in with her mom, and she's scrimping in other ways.HINOJOSA: We try to buy $5 shirts for school, pants, minimum shoes - $30. No more $80 shoes. No more excessive spending.BUCHELE: And that's hurting people like Lidia Escobar. I met her at her family-owned children's clothing store down the street.LIDIA ESCOBAR: It feels like a ghost town. You can tell people are just - don't have jobs right now and the extra money to spend on stuff.BUCHELE: It was the same at a paint store and a car dealership. Able Perez owns a frozen yogurt shop. He wishes the town's economy was more diversified, but...ABLE PEREZ: Everybody here now is involved in the oil business whether we like it or not.BUCHELE: So they keep tabs on oil prices and hope they go up again quickly. Back at the Food Pantry, Carlos Garcia, the unemployed roughneck, says it's hard to believe how fast things seem to fall apart.GARCIA: It was going good. Everybody was making money, and everybody was spoiling themselves, you know? And I can hear the cry all over town now. Everybody is suffering.BUCHELE: He has advice for the town's young people.GARCIA: Stick to school. And like I've always said, we chose the industry. It didn't choose us. And we're just paying for it now.BUCHELE: It's just, in a place like Alice, there really weren't a whole lot of other options.

Edmonton Terminal in Sherwood Park, Alberta. There were no injuries and no evacuation was required. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,201712191011CANADANWCANADAPR.C5520,Regional Business News,"Lack of detailed inspection procedures contributed to a March 2017 crude oil leak at the Enbridge Terminal in Sherwood Park, Alberta","EDMONTON, Dec. 19, 2017 /CNW/ - In its investigation report (P17H0019) released today, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) determined that the lack of detailed inspection procedures contributed to the March 2017 crude oil leak from a storage tank at the Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Edmonton Terminal in Sherwood Park, Alberta. There were no injuries and no evacuation was required.During a routine verification on 20 March 2017, Enbridge employees discovered traces of crude oil on the water surface in a creek that runs through the company's Edmonton Terminal. The source of the leak was a three-inch ball valve from an on-site storage tank. An estimated 10 cubic metres of product was released into the tank's secondary containment berm. Three cubic metres of the product were then released from the berm through its storm water drainage system into the creek.Emergency response resources, which were available on site, were deployed within a few minutes to identify the origin of the leak and mitigate the impacts of the release. As a result, all released product was recovered from the containment berm and from the creek before the product reached the nearby North Saskatchewan River.The investigation determined that the leak occurred when a gasket between the two halves of the ball valve was displaced out of its original position, likely due to volume expansion of frozen water within the valve. The product that was released into the creek flowed from a sluice gate valve at the end of the berm's storm water drain pipe. The sluice gate valve could not achieve a liquid-tight seal due to corrosion.Although Enbridge conducts inspections at regular intervals, detailed procedures had not been implemented to assist inspectors with evaluating the condition of tank or berm components and with determining whether the components were suitable for continued service.Following the occurrence, Enbridge initiated actions to ensure that all tank and containment berm components are thoroughly inspected. The company also reviewed its maintenance procedures as well as its hazard assessment and emergency response plans. The National Energy Board, which is responsible for regulating pipelines under federal jurisdiction, monitored the clean-up process and initiated a review of the occurrence to verify Enbridge's compliance with regulatory requirements, ensuring that the company took adequate corrective, preventive and safety actions.The TSB is an independent agency that investigates marine, pipeline, railway and aviation transportation occurrences. Its sole aim is the advancement of transportation safety. It is not the function of the Board to assign fault or determine civil or criminal liability.The TSB is online at www.tsb.gc.ca.

The transactions will be carried out in fiscal years 2022 through 2027, and, assuming no further legislation is passed, the SPR will decline by 40 percent from the 695 million barrels it held at the start of 2017 to about 410 million barrels by the beginning of 2028.The SPR is the single largest inventory of government-owned crude oil on the planet and was established to offset unexpected oil supply reductions. Located in four storage sites along the Gulf of Mexico, the SPR had been at about 97 percent of its 713.5 million-barrel design capacity. A trio of bills enacted in 2015 and 2016 called for the sale of 149 million barrels between 2017 and 2025.Most of these sales use volumetric requirements, with revenues going to the Department of Treasury. These oil sales are based on revenue targets authorized by Congress. The two recent congressional acts include:One of the SPR's core missions is to hold enough oil stocks to carry out U.S. obligations under the International Energy Program. The 1974 treaty established the International Energy Agency (IEA) and mandated that the U.S. must contribute to an IEA collective based on its share of oil consumption. The government relies on the SPR to meet this requirement.As a member of the IEA, the U.S. is required maintain stocks of crude oil and petroleum products, both public and private, that match at least 90 days of net import amounts. As imports of oil and petroleum products have steadily declined in recent years due to a spike in domestic production, this IEA requirement can now be met with lower SPR inventory levels.The Energy Information Administration (EIA) is projecting the U.S. to be a net exporter of petroleum by 2029. Based on November 2017 levels, the SPR currently holds crude oil inventories equivalent to 252 days of import protection. Private (commercial) stocks of crude oil provide an additional 452 million barrels, which is equivalent to another 172 days of import protection.PHOTO (COLOR)By Jeff ReinkeCopyright of ThomasNet News is the property of Thomas Publishing Company LLC and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

[ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,bizwire.c79243960,Regional Business News,Medallion Pipeline Announces Successful Open Season for Major Expansion of Crude Oil Pipeline and Supplemental Open Season," Medallion Pipeline Company, LLC (Medallion), a subsidiary of Medallion Midstream LLC, today announced the successful closing of its binding open season for a major expansion of its existing crude oil pipeline system in the Midland Basin (the Expansion). As previously announced, the Expansion will nearly double the capacity of Medallion’s existing Wolfcamp Connector mainline system through a partial loop of the Wolfcamp Connector system (the Wolfcamp Expansion) and will increase the capacity of the existing Howard Lateral (the Howard Expansion). The Wolfcamp Expansion will increase the existing capacity on the Wolfcamp Connector from 105,000 barrels per day to 200,000 barrels per day and the Howard Expansion will increase the capacity of the existing Howard Lateral from 60,000 barrels per day to 85,000 barrels per day.   Based on the binding capacity bids received during the open season, Medallion has executed a long-term Transportation Services Agreement sufficient to move forward with the construction of the Expansion. In addition, one existing committed shipper on the Wolfcamp Connector has agreed to extend its current Transportation Services Agreement to obtain the benefit of the Expansion rate. Once complete, the Expansion will provide much-needed capacity to transport crude oil produced in the Midland Basin to downstream pipelines and markets. The Expansion is expected to commence partial commercial operations in the third quarter of 2017 and full commercial operations in the fourth quarter of 2017.   “The response to the open season and the continued interest of potential shippers in increased pipeline capacity in the Midland Basin is compelling,” said Randy Lentz, Medallion CEO. “We are excited about the significant production growth in the Midland Basin and the opportunity to meet our customers’ growing needs.”   Because of the significant interest expressed by potential shippers during the open season, and based on ongoing discussions with potential shippers, Medallion is conducting a supplemental open season to solicit additional binding long-term commitments for a further expansion of the Medallion system. The supplemental open season maintains the same transportation options, the same origin and destination points, and the same rates as proposed in the open season, but provides a further opportunity to increase the capacity beyond the levels originally proposed in the open season. The supplemental open season provides an opportunity for interested shippers to acquire long-term firm capacity, under minimum 10-year term Transportation Services Agreements and other eligibility requirements, as a committed firm shipper on either the Wolfcamp Expansion, the Howard Expansion, or both. The supplemental open season opens on June 15, 2017, and will close as of 4:00 p.m. CDT on June 30, 2017. All bids must be submitted to Medallion during the supplemental open season. Bona fide prospective shippers may obtain copies of the Transportation Services Agreement, as well as the proposed Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Texas Railroad Commission tariffs by contacting the Medallion representative listed below. Medallion requires a prospective shipper to execute a Confidentiality Agreement prior to delivery of these documents. More information concerning the Expansion and the binding open season is available on the Medallion website www.medallionmidstream.com or by contacting the Medallion representative listed below.

A new study is recommending the United States end its four-decade ban on crude oil exports. The report by the energy branch of the global consulting firm IHS says ending the ban would lower gasoline prices, create jobs and boost government revenues. NPR's John Ydstie has more.JOHN YDSTIE: The ban on crude oil exports was implemented in the 1970s, during an era of U.S. price controls and declining U.S. production. IHS Vice Chairman Daniel Yergin says ending the ban would create a broader market for now booming U.S. oil production. He says that would boost the amount of crude oil in the global market and lead to cheaper global gasoline prices.DANIEL YERGIN: And that, in turn, would flow back into the U.S. - back to the gasoline pump - and would be about 8 cents a gallon less for American motorists than would otherwise be the case.YDSTIE: U.S. gasoline prices are influenced by the global market because the U.S. already imports and exports gasoline. Yergin says the IHS study finds that the larger market for U.S. crude would boost U.S. production by 1.2 million barrels a day.YERGIN: At the peak, it will translate into almost a million more jobs. And over the forecast period, it would translate into $1.3 trillion more government revenues.YDSTIE: That would be the total over a 15-year period. The IHS study was funded by energy companies, many of which would benefit from a broader market for U.S. crude. But some refiners oppose lifting the ban because the large supplies of U.S. crude in the domestic market mean they can pay less for crude oil and make higher margins by shipping refined products abroad.Some environmentalists oppose lifting the ban, arguing it will only encourage further use of fossil fuels. The left-leaning organization Center for American Progress also wants to keep the ban in place. It points to higher gasoline prices than emerged on the West Coast in the 1990s, when the export ban on Alaskan oil was temporarily lifted.

0,Morning Edition (NPR). 01/01/2014.,Transcript,,,,6XN201401011111,Newspaper Source,Derailing Revives Calls To Change How Trains Haul Crude Oil.,"RENEE MONTAGNE: This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning, I'm Renee Montagne.Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board are in the small town of Casselton, North Dakota, trying to learn what caused a fiery train crash. It's the latest in a series of accidents involving trains hauling crude oil. By far the most destruction happened last summer in Canada, where the center of a town in Quebec was destroyed, leaving 47 people dead.Monday's crash in North Dakota caused no injuries. Still, as NPR's Jeff Brady reports, the mayor of Casselton is calling for changes in how crude oil is transported.JEFF BRADY: North Dakota is in the middle of an oil drilling boom and getting all that crude to market has been a problem. Without pipelines, companies have turned to trains. Monday's accident happened one mile west of Casselton. A BNSF Railway train hauling grain derailed. Then another BNSF train pulling oil tanks crashed into it.Robert Sumwalt is a board member with the National Transportation Safety Board.ROBERT SUMWALT: The damage to the oil train, both head-in locomotives, were destroyed, 20 cars derailed.BRADY: Black smoke and a towering fireball rose from the flaming wreckage. It prompted authorities to urge residents nearby to evacuate. People have since returned and the railroad has opened a claims center to compensate residents for expenses associated with the evacuation.After the deadly oil-train crash in Quebec, the types of tanker cars railroads use came under scrutiny. Critics and many in the industry say the cars need to be made safer. It appears those same types of tankers were involved in the North Dakota accident, according to Sumwalt.SUMWALT: We have preliminary information that indicates they are DOT-111 cars. But there are different types of DOT-111 cars, so we will want to be confirming that. That's certainly one of the things that we will be looking at.BRADY: Federal regulators already have tightened some rules for oil shippers. And they're in the process of putting even more stringent requirements in place, especially when it comes to these tank cars.Patti Reilly, with the Association of American Railroads, says her group asked the government a few months back for new standards.PATTI REILLY: What it means is all of these tank cars - 92,000 of them - will have to be retrofitted or phased out.BRADY: The industry put some new requirements in place for tank cars built in the last few years. But Reilly says in light of the Quebec accident, it's clear even tougher standards are needed for existing tank cars hauling oil.REILLY: It will need a thicker, more puncture-resistant outer-shell jacket around the entire tank car, and thermal protection, There will have to be at either ends of the tank car extra-protective head shields.BRADY: And a pressure release valve that combined with these other improvements should make moving oil by rail safer.The NTSB and other federal agencies on the ground now in North Dakota say preventing accidents like this is a primary goal of their current investigation.The North Dakota accident is just one rail incident the NTSB is working on right now. There was the deadly commuter train accident that happened just after Thanksgiving in New York. And the board is investigating another train accident that happened Monday in Louisiana.The NTSB's Sumwalt says that means a final report for the North Dakota oil train accident will not be finished quickly.SUMWALT: We are very, very busy, especially in our rail division. So I'm going to say that I suspect it will be at least 12 months and maybe even longer.BRADY: Sumwalt says if investigators learn something that could improve safety in the meantime, the NTSB could issue emergency recommendations for the rail industry sooner.Jeff Brady, NPR News.Copyright of Morning Edition (NPR) is the property of National Public Radio, Inc.

""These ETNs provide a way for sophisticated investors to implement innovative short-term trading and hedging strategies based on the ETNs' leveraged exposure to Brent crude oil futures contracts.""About the ETNs and the IndexThe ETNs seek to provide a 3x leveraged long or 3x leveraged inverse return, as applicable, based on the daily performance of the S&amp;P GSCI® Brent Crude ER (the ""Index"") (as adjusted for fees). The ETNs do not attempt to, and should not be expected to, provide returns that reflect 3-to-1 positive or inverse leverage on the return of the Index for periods longer than a single day. The ETNs rebalance their theoretical exposure on a daily basis, increasing exposure in response to that day's gains or reducing exposure in response to that day's losses. The ETNs are intended to provide traders and similarly sophisticated investors with an exchange traded security that allows them to express their short-term market views on the performance of Brent crude oil futures contracts composing the Index.

Instead, the ETNs are intended to be daily trading tools for traders and similarly sophisticated investors to express short-term market views and manage daily trading risks. The ETNs are designed to achieve their stated investment objectives on a daily basis, and, therefore, their performance over different periods of time can differ significantly from their stated daily objectives. The ETNs are considerably riskier than securities that have intermediate or long-term investment objectives, and may not be suitable for investors who plan to hold them for a period of more than one day. Investors should actively and frequently monitor their investments in the ETNs, on a daily or intraday basis, and any decision to hold the ETNs for more than one day should be made with great care and only as the result of a series of daily (or more frequent) investment decisions to remain invested in the ETNs for the next one-day period. If you hold the ETNs for more than one day, it is possible that you will suffer significant losses in the ETNs even if the performance of the Index over the time you hold the ETNs is positive, in the case of UBRT, or negative, in the case of DBRT.Accordingly, the ETNs should be purchased only by sophisticated investors who understand the Index (as defined below) and the consequences of investing in the ETNs that are designed to provide exposure to three times (3x) or negative three times (-3x), as applicable, the daily performance of the Index.The ETNs do not provide direct exposure to the spot price of Brent crude oil. Because the Index is composed of Brent crude oil futures contracts and does not track the spot price of Brent crude oil, the Index and, in turn, the ETNs can be expected to perform very differently from such spot price.Investing in the ETNs involves significant risks.

0,All Things Considered (NPR). 10/30/2013.,Transcript,,,,6XN201310302116,Newspaper Source,Trains Gain Steam In Race To Transport Crude Oil In The U.S.,"ROBERT SIEGEL: It's five years since the Keystone XL was first proposed. The 1,700-mile pipeline would carry millions of gallons of crude oil from Alberta, Canada, south to refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast. But largely in response to environmental concerns, the Obama administration has yet to decide whether to allow the project to go forward. In the meantime, as NPR's Jackie Northam reports, refiners are increasingly turning to rail to move their crude.(SOUNDBITE OF TRAIN WHISTLE)JACKIE NORTHAM: A long train whistle pierces the quiet of an autumnal Delaware countryside, moments before a train sweeps around a broad curve. Two heavy locomotives help haul dozens of white cylindrical rail cars loaded with 70,000 barrels of crude oil. The U.S. is awash in oil, due in large part to advances in drilling techniques such as hydraulic fracturing or fracking.U.S. oil production hit a 24-year high in September. But there's a challenge getting the crude from the field to the refinery. Most oil is moved by pipeline, but the increased production has overtaken U.S. pipeline capability. So, oil refiners and producers are turning to other transportation networks to move heavy crude from the tar sands of northern Canada and a light, sweet crude from North Dakota. In particular, producers have turned to the railway.MICHAEL MURRAY: We've got a pretty good view of the refinery there.UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yup.MURRAY: Now, there is a train in the loops. There's the two locomotives.NORTHAM: Father Michael Murray has studied and written about the rail industry for 40 years. He knows some of the best vantage points for spotting trains and studying oil refineries along the East Coast. Today, he's in Delaware City, Delaware, near the PBF Energy refinery. From his vantage point on a public road, Murray peers across an open field next to the refinery.MURRAY: And you see the tank cars with the lids open. They're being unloaded.NORTHAM: The silver-haired priest, sporting jeans and a maroon golf vest bearing a Norfolk Southern logo, listens to the railways on his walkie-talkie to find out what trains are going where and what they're carrying.UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Engine number 8510.NORTHAM: Murray watch for months as Norfolk Southern Railway reconfigured its tracks outside the PBF Energy refinery, apparently to better maneuver the oil trains. PBF says it installed new oval tracks at the refinery to more efficiently unload the large amounts of oil coming in by rail. Murray says the mile-long oil trains are often called rolling pipelines.MURRAY: These trains don't stop. In the 2,000 miles it takes to get from North Dakota and Canada to here, the only time they stop is to refuel the locomotives and to change the crew. They are a hot train.NORTHAM: Meaning?MURRAY: Priority. Nothing gets in their way.NORTHAM: The use of rail cars to ship crude is growing enormously, jumping from 9,500 carloads in 2008 to 234,000 carloads last year, according to the Association of American Railroads. That, despite increasing questions about rail safety, especially in the wake of a deadly crash in Quebec last July, when an oil train derailed, killing dozens of people.Sandy Fielden, an analyst with RBN Energy, says that hasn't slowed down refiners wanting to move oil. Pipelines are less expensive to transfer crude, but that can be offset by refiners having to pay storage costs if the pipelines are too congested. Fielden says laying rail track or upgrading refineries for trains is not as expensive as building a new pipeline. He says railways also require shorter and less rigid agreements with refiners.SANDY FIELDEN: They only need to commit to about two years worth instead of 10 to 15 years on a pipeline, which means they're taking much less risk.NORTHAM: Texas-based Valero Energy signed on to use the Keystone XL pipeline several years ago to ship heavy Canadian crude to its terminals on the Gulf Coast. But spokesman Bill Day says given the long delay to build that pipeline, Valero began buying rail cars and reworking some of its refineries to bring in trains. Day says Valero likes having alternatives.BILL DAY: We like getting the oil from different sources. If we can bring it in by ship and by pipeline and by rail and even by truck, in some instances, that gives us more flexibility. The more options we have, the better off we are.NORTHAM: Day says given the amount of oil being produced nowadays, even if the construction of the Keystone pipeline went ahead tomorrow, Valero would continue to use rail.

ProShares now offers one of the largest lineups of ETFs, with more than $27 billion in assets. The company is the leader in strategies such as dividend growth, alternative and geared (leveraged and inverse). ProShares continues to innovate with products that provide strategic and tactical opportunities for investors to manage risk and enhance returns.   These ProShares ETFs seek a return that is -3x or 3x the return of the index (target) for a single day, as measured from one NAV calculation to the next. Due to the compounding of daily returns, the funds’ returns over periods other than one day will likely differ in amount and possibly direction from the target return for the same period. These effects may be more pronounced in funds with larger or inverse multiples and in funds with volatile benchmarks. Investors should monitor their holdings consistent with their strategies, as frequently as daily. For more on correlation, leverage and other risks, please read the prospectus.   Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. ProShares are non-diversified and entail certain risks, including risk associated with the use of derivatives (futures contracts, swap agreements and similar instruments), imperfect benchmark correlation, leverage and market price variance, all of which can increase volatility and decrease performance. Short ProShares should lose value when their market indexes or benchmarks rise—a result that is opposite from traditional ETFs. There are additional risks related to commodity investments due to large institutional purchases or sales, and natural and technological factors such as severe weather, unusual climate change, and development and depletions of alternative resources. Certain derivative instruments will subject the fund to counterparty risk and credit risk, which could result in significant losses for a fund. Please see the prospectus for a more complete description of risks. There is no guarantee any ProShares ETF will achieve its investment objective.  ProShares Trust II is a commodity pool as defined in the Commodity Exchange Act and the applicable regulations of the CFTC.

According to the report, in terms of volume, the global oilfield chemicals market is expected to surpass around 41 million tons by 2026. The global oilfield chemicals market is driven by rise in the development of unconventional oil and gas fields, increase in the demand for crude oil, and surge in crude oil prices. North America is estimated to hold a major share of the global oilfield chemicals market during the forecast period, owing to the development of fields for shale gas, tight oil, and CBM in the region. The drilling fluids application segment held a major share of the global market in 2017 and the trend is likely to continue throughout the forecast period.(Logo: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/664869/Transparency_Market_Research_Logo.jpg )Request a Sample of Oilfield Chemicals Market: https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&amp;rep_id=47205Rise in demand for surfactants for upstream, midstream and downstream operations in the oilfield sectorBased on product, the oilfield chemicals market has been segmented into biocides, corrosion and scale inhibitors, demulsifiers, surfactants, polymers, lubricants, hydrogen sulfide scavengers, fluid loss additives, and others. Surfactants are surface-active agents used for lowering the surface tension of liquid molecules, thereby aiding in the separation of a liquid and a solid or that of two liquids. Surfactants provide dispersing, foaming, and reduction in viscosity. They increase inhibitive properties of the fluid and also improve their tolerance. Surfactants have a wide range of applications in the oilfield sector. They are used throughout the lifecycle of an oil field right from exploration, drilling, cementing, production, and well stimulation to work over and completion. The surfactants segment is projected to hold a major share of the global oilfield chemicals market, in terms of both value and volume, during the forecast period and the trend is expected to continue throughout the forecast period.View in-depth table of contents for this report @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/report-toc/47205Rise in development of unconventional oilfields to propel the demand for oilfield chemicalsShale gas reserves have low permeability. In order to recover the natural gas contained in these reserves, hydraulic fracking is applied. Specialty chemicals are required to ensure that the hydraulic fracking process is efficient. Shale gas reserves extend horizontally over several kilometers and the vertical formation is very thin. Therefore, horizontal drilling is more preferred to explore shale gas from a shale reservoir. The horizontal drilling process requires technology with higher precision compared to vertical drilling. The cost of horizontal drilling is much more than conventional drilling. This increases the production cost of shale gas and hence, it is expensive than crude oil. However, this scenario is likely to change due to technological developments and drilling of more number of shale gas wells. Shale gas production calls for more amount of oilfield chemicals than crude oil production, due to low permeability of gas. According to the EIA estimates; China, Argentina, Algeria, the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Australia, South Africa, Russia, and Brazil are the top 10 countries with technologically recoverable shale gas resources. The U.S. held more than 90% share of the shale gas production in 2017. Apart from shale gas, tight oil and coal bed methane are other unconventional resources with high demand for oilfield chemicals.Request for Multiple Chapters on global oilfield chemicals market:https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=MC&amp;rep_id=47205Drilling fluids application segment to dominate the global oilfield chemicals marketBased on application, the oilfield chemicals market has been classified into production chemicals, drilling fluids, well stimulation fluids, cementing fluids, enhanced oil recovery, and workover and completion. According to the American Petroleum Institute (API), a drilling fluid is defined as a circulating fluid used in rotary drilling to perform any or all of the functions in drilling operations. It is a mixture of natural and synthetic chemical compounds that are employed to lubricate and cool the drill bit; carry cuttings to the surface; clean the hole bottom; control formation pressures; and improve the function of the drill string and tools in the hole. The drilling fluids segment has been classified into two sub-segments: water-based drilling muds and oil-based drilling muds. Type of the fluid base to be used depends on drilling and formation requirements and requirements for disposal of the fluid. Some of the drilling fluids are anti-foams, corrosion control inhibitors, dispersants, scale inhibitors, shale stabilizers, thinners and conditioners, viscosifiers, and surfactants. The drilling fluids application segment constituted a prominent i.e. more than 40% share of the global oilfield chemicals market in 2017. The share is estimated to increase by the end of the forecast period.North America to dominate the global market during the forecast periodGeographically, the global oilfield chemicals market has been divided into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East &amp; Africa. North America is anticipated to hold a leading share of the global market during the forecast period, owing to the growing number of unconventional oil and gas fields in the U.S. and Canada.Ask for Discount on Premium Research Report (US$ 5795) With Complete TOC: https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=D&amp;rep_id=47205Slightly fragmented market with a few major players and several local players across the worldThe barrier for new players entering the oilfield chemicals market is low.

On the other hand, exports to Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea increased by 7.93, 1.67 and 9.79 respectively in comparison with January. Imports of the United States (US) of the Omani crude oil during February 2016 accounted for 7.99 percent of the total Omani oil exports, Oman News Agency, reported, citing the ministry figures.Referring to the trend in oil prices in the international market, the average price of West Texas crude grade in New York touched US$32.20 per barrel in February 2016, showing a decline with $0.31 a barrel over the previous month.The average price of North Sea Brent grade reached $33.53 a barrel, an increase of $1.49 per barrel over January.The trading of Oman Crude Oil Future Contract at Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME Oman) witnessed a rise during February, as same as other oil types in the world. It averaged between $31.94 and $26.83 per barrel. Meanwhile, Oman oil price (April Delivery 2016) stood at $30.23 comprising a rise by 2.83 cents compared to the March 2016 delivery.The crude oil prices for most reference oils recovered during February trading compared to settlement prices in January 2016. The prices hovered around $30 per barrel. The Omani crude oil restored some of its profits that was lost last month and increased by more than 10 percent.This increase is attributed to a number of reasons that directly affected the prices, namely the depreciation of the US dollar to record levels in the past seven weeks. This depreciation makes the raw commodities priced in the US dollar less costly for holders of other currencies.It is also attributed to the decline in US shell oil production and the recovery of Asian transactions after the release of the US data, which showed a decline in the number of oil rigs operating for nine successive weeks.Copyright 2016 by Emirates News Agency Distributed by UPICopyright of Arabia 2000 is the property of Arabia 2000.

The daily rates from both were at their highest since at least 2001, according to data available on the Thomson Reuters Eikon terminal.In contrast, India's total imports from Latin America fell by a quarter in January from a year ago to 706,000 bpd, the data showed.“We are going slow in the purchase of Latin America oil and have raised supplies from the Middle East,” said H. Kumar, managing director of Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd .Indian refiners say they increased imports of Middle Eastern crude after Brent rose relative to the Dubai benchmark , making oil priced off the latter more attractive.As well, on top of competitive monthly prices for its oil compared with similar grades, Iraq provides discounts that could amount to more than US$1 a barrel to compensate for crude quality changes, trade sources said.“Basra Heavy is better priced compared to any other heavy crude. Even Basra Light is better priced compared to other heavy crudes,” A. K. Sharma, head of finance at Indian Oil Corp said last week.IOC buys about 300,000 bpd of Iraqi oil, including a recently signed term deal for Basra Heavy.Reliance Industries Ltd , owner of the world's biggest refining complex, has also entered into a long-term deal with Iraq to buy Basra Heavy, according to its website.Indian refiners that have invested billions of dollars in upgrading their plants are scouting for cheaper heavy, sour grades such as those from Iraq and Iran to maximise gross refining margins.“For a country like India where value of local currency is fluctuating and so are global oil markets, it's better to go for nearby markets for oil purchases than going for a parcel that takes up to two months to reach India,” said Ehsan Ul-Haq, senior analyst at London-based consultancy KBC Energy Economics.The Indian rupee is edging near a record low of 68.85 to the U.S. dollar hit in August 2013 - when India was mired in its worst currency turmoil in more than two decades.In January, India also took just over 170,000 bpd of Iranian crude, down nearly 40 percent from the same month last year, the data showed. Volumes from Iran are expected to surge from this month as Indian buyers start receiving barrels snapped up from Tehran soon after economic sanctions were lifted.Copyright 2016 by Emirates News Agency Distributed by UPICopyright of Arabia 2000 is the property of Arabia 2000.

Permian Basin rigs, located in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico, declined by six to 156, while the Williston basin, located in eastern Montana, southern Canada and the Dakotas, saw its rigs fall by three to 33.Eagle Ford's rig count has plunged 80% since early October 2014. Permian rigs are down 72%, and Williston rigs have fallen 83% since that time.The rig count decline comes after Continental Resources and Whiting Petroleum, two of the largest oil producers in North Dakota's Bakken formation, announced cutbacks. Last month, Continental stopped completing Bakken wells in Q3 2015. The Oklahoma City-based company reported net losses of $354 million in 2015.Whiting Petroleum announced plans in Q2 to stop completing its wells in North Dakota as well as Colorado's DJ Basin formation. The Denver-based company last month reported a $2.2 billion net loss last year, including a $1.5 billion writedown in its oilfields' value.Also last month, Pioneer Natural Resources reported a fourth-quarter loss of $623 million, less than analysts expected. But it also announced plans to cut its rig count in half to 12.Shares of all three companies have steadily declined since mid-2014, as crude oil prices plunged about 70%. But all three companies have rallied to some degree, as crude oil, which was trading below $27 per barrel earlier this year, climbed to nearly $38 per barrel.CIARAN MCEVOYCopyright 2016 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

U.S. crude production is projected to climb to a 48-year high next year, according to a separate EIA report.Oil has fluctuated above $50 a barrel since a deal to trim output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 11 other nations took effect on Jan. 1. While OPEC members implement pledged cuts and Russia says its own reductions are ahead of schedule, U.S. production has edged higher as drillers boosted the rig count to the most since October 2015.""Gasoline is just getting slaughtered today, and it's dragging crude with it,"" Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, said by phone. ""A 2-million-barrel gasoline build would bring us to an all-time high, and crude inventories have been climbing too.""West Texas intermediate crude for March delivery fell 84 cents to $52.17 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It's the lowest close since Jan. 19. Total volume traded was near the 100-day average at 2:56 p.m. ET.Gasoline futures for March delivery dropped 1.5% to $1.4875 a gallon, the lowest close since Nov. 29. The March gasoline crack spread, a rough measure of the profit from refining crude into the fuel, dropped as much as 4.7% to $9.932 a barrel.Inventories of gasoline probably increased 1.6 million barrels to 258.7 million last week, according to the median forecast in the Bloomberg survey. Stockpiles of the motor fuel reached a record 258.7 million barrels in the week ended Feb. 12, 2016.Crude supplies probably rose 2.5 million barrels, the survey showed. Stockpiles are at 494.8 million barrels, the highest seasonal level in more than three decades, according to weekly data compiled by the EIA since 1982.U.S. crude output will average 9.53 million barrels a day in 2018, up from 9.3 million projected in January, the EIA said in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook released Tuesday. That would be the highest since 1970, agency data show.The trading boom that cushioned the profits of Royal Dutch Shell PLC and BP PLC through the price slump appears to be over. BP said on Tuesday it made a ""small"" loss trading oil in the fourth quarter, while Shell last week said profits ""flattened"" in late 2016. These companies' trading divisions thrived in 2015 and 2016 because an unusually strong contango -- where contracts for future delivery trade higher than spot prices -- made it profitable to store oil.Brent for April settlement fell 67 cents, or 1.2%, to $55.05 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark closed at a $2.27 premium to April WTI.The dollar climbed, making commodities priced in the currency less attractive to investors. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a gauge of the greenback against 10 major peers, rose 0.3%.PHOTO (COLOR): Oil dropped to the lowest in more than two weeks amid estimates that U.S. crude and gasoline inventories continue to climb.(©ping han/Fotolia/stock.adobe.com)By BLOOMBERG NEWSCopyright of Investors Business Daily is the property of Investor's Business Daily and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

There were no injuries.On 17 February 2017, a 20-inch Grand Rapids Pipeline GP Ltd. (GRP Ltd.) pipeline was being installed using a horizontal directional boring technique in an area where other pipelines were already in place. During its installation, the 24-inch Line 2 pipeline operated by Enbridge Pipelines Inc. (Enbridge) was struck and punctured during the boring operation. Approximately 1000 m3 of petroleum crude oil condensate was released. Most of the released product was recovered. The National Energy Board continues to monitor remedial actions on site, and to provide environmental oversight.The investigation determined that the horizontal directional boring took place without a field-measured confirmation of the exact location and depth of cover for the Line 2 pipeline at the crossing with the GRP Ltd. pipeline. Measurements taken from an adjacent pipeline were used instead, which were highlighted within the project documentation to indicate that a field verification had not been completed. However, this was not an established process for communicating a deviation at Ledcor Pipeline Limited (Ledcor), the construction contractor. In addition, a ground disturbance checklist completed at the start of the shift incorrectly indicated that visual depth confirmation had been performed for all pipelines to be crossed. As a result, there were missed opportunities to further assess the drill path.Following the occurrence, Enbridge initiated a review of internal communications, including clarifying and harmonizing technical terminology related to pipeline crossings. GRP Ltd. enhanced ground disturbance and pipeline crossing procedures and checklists, and issued further guidance to employees. Ledcor enhanced its procedures related to line crossings.See the investigation page for more information.The TSB is an independent agency that investigates marine, pipeline, railway and aviation transportation occurrences.

The aircraft deliveries by the industry in 2018 are likely to reach a record high in 2018 with all OEMs boosting production rate. The 2018 edition of this annual publication provides comprehensive analysis and key insights into the Strategies &amp; Plans being conceptualized &amp; implemented by the World's 5 leading commercial aircraft manufacturers for the near to medium term horizon as the industry continues on its high growth trajectory. The report is unique with reference to its core focus on and deep qualitative analysis of strategies &amp; plans for the industry OEMs.The market landscape in the Global Commercial Aircraft market is on the verge of a tectonic shift with the Airbus' joint ownership of the C-Series program along with Bombardier which provides a significant and much needed boost to the beleaguered C-Series program given Airbus' strong global sales &amp; marketing network while adding a scratch-up, great performing 21st century aircraft to Airbus' portfolio without having to invest anything outright. The Airbus-Bombardier deal stacks the odds against Boeing in the battle between giants in the global commercial aircraft market. Boeing's plans for a combination deal with Embraer, as a countermove, is likely to shake-up things a bit more.The commercial aircraft industry is headed for further technological generation shift with electric propulsion technologies being developed for commercial aircrafts aimed at rapid reduction in CO2 emissions to meet regulatory guidelines while simultaneously bringing down operating costs significantly over long term. Further, 2018 is going to be an important year for the industry with three new aircraft programs scheduled to enter service, led by, Boeing's 737 MAX 9, Airbus A321 LR and Embraer's E190-E2. Going forward into 2018, rising crude oil prices; which have resurged to $70 per barrel level, and are at their highest level since late 2014; and escalating labour costs are likely to be the biggest challenges for legacy as well as low cost carriers to maintain profitability level in an overall favourable operating environment with the long term demand drivers &amp; fundamentals for commercial aviation remaining firmly in place with strong passenger traffic growth trend projected over the next 2 decades. Against this backdrop, the report provides analysis of the strategies &amp; plans being developed by the Top 5 commercial aircraft OEMs. The report also provides a comprehensive SWOT framework analysis on all 5 industry OEMs covered in the report providing useful insights into each player's respective strengths and weaknesses. The report concludes with analysis of key trends, market conditions, potential growth opportunities and demand growth projections for the global commercial aircraft market through 2036.Report Excerpts:Key Topics Covered:Section 1: Business Structure &amp; Snapshota) Foundedb) Headquarteredc) Business Segmentsd) Employeese) Product Portfolio Major Platforms, Programs and Key Competitorsf) Market Capitalizationg) Key Executivesh) Shareholding Pattern &amp; StructureSection 2: Financial Performance Snapshot - Charts &amp; Analysis for each Company:1.

Headline earnings per share (HEPS) increased by 17% to R17,67 and earnings per share (EPS) decreased by 21% to R11,29 compared to the prior period. EPS was negatively impacted by the scrapping of our US gas-to-liquids (GTL) project mounting to R1,1 billion (US$83 million) and a partial impairment of the Canadian shale gas assets of R2,8 billion (CAD281 million). Core HEPS, which is reflective of our sustainable profitability, was up 5% to R18,22. The Board has declared an interim gross cash dividend of R5,00 per share based on Core EPS, from R4,80 per share in the prior period.Average Brent crude oil prices moved higher by 19% and since December 2017, spot prices have moved closer to the US$70/bbl mark, which if sustained at these levels, are expected to positively impact the company's results during the second half of financial year 2018. Similarly, Natref refining margins increased by 16% to US$9,73/bbl.In the chemicals business, there has been a steady increase in most commodity chemical prices and the average margins for most of Sasol's specialty chemicals products, in dollar terms, have remained resilient.Excluding the effect of the hedging programme, the average rand/US dollar market exchange rate strengthened by 4% from the prior period to R13,40, and the closing rand/US dollar market exchange rate strengthened by 5% from R13,06 in June 2017 to R12,37. This resulted in translation losses of R1,2 billion on the valuation of the balance sheet compared to translation losses of R341 million in the prior period.The results were, however, constrained by unfortunate economic conditions in South Africa, which impacted demand for Sasol's products, operational challenges at its Natref operations, a much stronger closing rand/US dollar exchange rate and the negative impact of re-measurement and once-off items.Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, Sasol continued to deliver a strong operational performance.Operational and financial performance highlightsPerformance Chemicals sales volumes increased by 3% mainly due to increased market demand. Normalised Base Chemicals sales volumes decreased by 1% mainly due to lower volumes from Secunda Synfuels Operations (SSO).Production volumes from Eurasian Operations increased by 2% due to stronger demand and increased plant availability.Natref's production volumes were down 21% owing to planned plant shutdowns and an unexpected Eskom electricity supply interruption at the start of the financial period. This, together with softer market demand, lowered our liquid fuels sales volumes by 3%.Production volumes from SSO decreased by 1% due to a planned shutdown. Based on the current plant performance, Sasol expects to produce 7,7 million tons for the full financial year.At Mining, stabilising operations post the strike in FY17 has been a challenge. There has been some improvement in production run rates and management will maintain focus on reaching the productivity rates achieved prior to the strike.""Our sustained focus on cost, cash and capital conservation drove a largely strong set of results, notwithstanding continued macro-economic volatility. The recent recovery in global oil and product prices positively impacted our results, however this was offset by operational challenges at our Natref and mining operations, currency effects and poor economic conditions in South Africa. Encouraging recent developments signal a more stable political and investor friendly outlook for the country, in addition to a more positive global growth outlook with stronger demand in markets where we operate. Our recent safety performance has regrettably been marred by tragic fatalities in our mining operations. We are committed to the safety and health of our employees, communities and the environment. Safety, as one of our core values and number one priority will receive our constant and unwavering attention,"" said Joint President and Chief Executive Officer, Bongani Nqwababa.""We are making steady progress in delivering the LCCP within the revised schedule, as we place increased emphasis on business readiness. Once fully operational, the LCCP will transform Sasol's earnings profile. The start-up of this world-scale chemicals facility and the implementation of our broad-based black economic empowerment ownership structure, Sasol Khanyisa, are landmark milestones to be delivered this calendar year. Guided by our clear strategic choices, we will continue to enhance our robust foundation to deliver on our refined value-based growth strategy. To this end, exercising disciplined capital allocation remains paramount to ensure we deliver sustainable growth and ongoing value to our shareholders,"" said Joint President and Chief Executive Officer, Stephen Cornell.Sustained cost, cash and capital conservation focusSasol's low oil Response Plan achieved capital conservation and cash savings of R6,2 billion for the period. This brings the total capital and cash conserved since January 2015 to R75,6 billion, which exceeds the target of R65 - R75 billion.It has also delivered sustainable annual cash savings of R3,5 billion. Together with the Business Performance Enhancement Programme (BPEP) saving, it achieved at least R8,9 billion in sustainable cash cost savings.Cash fixed costs, excluding capital growth and once-off business establishment costs, increased by 2% in real terms, however, it still expects to track an inflation assumption of 6% for the full year.Looking ahead, Sasol will maximise value from its existing portfolio of diversified assets through robust asset reviews, continuous improvement and digitalisation initiatives. This will ultimately enhance the company's competitiveness, reduce its cost base and improve the return on invested capital.Delivering on growth projectsThe company's focus for the Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP) remains commissioning, operations and business readiness. To this end, the progressive start-up of utilities is ongoing and gaining momentum. As at 31 December 2017, the project was 81% complete with construction execution around 54%. Capital expenditure is currently at US$8,8 billion.With the priority on business readiness, Sasol continues to engage new markets and prospective customers, with around 90% of LCCP's specialty chemicals products to be placed with existing customers. Contracts are also in place for all major distribution channel partners.In Mozambique, US$285 million has already been invested on the Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) field development plan, largely comprising drilling and surface facilities. Nine wells have been successfully drilled and tested relating to the first phase, while drilling the first of two delineation wells relating to the second phase, is underway.Sasol anticipates oil production to be between the mid to lower-end of the range presented in the field development plan. The gas wells have confirmed that there is sufficient gas to cover initial downstream opportunities.Several capital projects also reached beneficial operations during the period under review, such as the world's largest oxygen train in Secunda and the Gemini High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) joint venture in the US. The FT Wax Expansion Project in Sasolburg is also progressing well.Continued sustainability and heightened investment focus in Southern AfricaThrough high impact skills and social investment programmes, Sasol continually responds to the needs of employees and fenceline communities. In the past six months, the company disbursed R680 million globally in skills and social investment programmes, of which the majority was in Southern Africa.Sasol has invested more than R20 billion on capital projects over the past 12 years to minimise its environmental footprint. The company is also diligently implementing its air quality improvement roadmaps for its South African operations as a key instrument to sustain compliance and apply for further postponements to help in implementing our roadmaps by 2025.Sasol management is particularly encouraged by recent developments in South Africa that signal a more stable political and investor friendly outlook. A more conducive business environment will create even greater opportunities for Sasol to be a force for good, where our capital investments have totalled over R20 billion over the past three years.In all markets where Sasol has a presence, from Doha to Shanghai and Marl, Sasol strives to be a credible partner to stakeholders by ensuring they derive benefits from the company's presence and have a positive association with Sasol.The year aheadThe current economic climate continues to remain highly volatile and uncertain. While oil price and foreign exchange movements are outside the company's control and may impact results, management's focus remains firmly on managing factors within its control, including volume growth, cost optimisation, effective capital allocation, focused financial risk management and maintaining an investment grade credit rating.Sasol expects an overall strong operational performance for the year ending 30 June 2018, with:The salient dates for holders of ordinary shares and Sasol BEE ordinary shares are:The salient dates for holders of our American Depository Receipts are[1]:Comprehensive additional information is available on Sasol's website: http://www.sasol.comDisclaimer - Forward-looking statements: Sasol may, in this document, make certain statements that are not historical facts and relate to analyses and other information which are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable.

The first results, released Thursday, provide a snapshot of recent traffic: Oil trains transported about 14.7 million barrels of crude through Washington in the fourth quarter of 2016. On average, that was about 1 million barrels of crude weekly.     Trains began shipping crude oil through Washington in 2012, and volumes have continued to grow.     Most of the oil trains enter the state from Idaho and travel through Spokane en route to oil refineries in Western Washington. Some of the oil also passes through Bellingham from trains originating in Canada.     The trains travel through some of the state's most populous areas and along the Columbia River.     Oil train safety has been in the national spotlight following accidents such as the fiery derailment in 2013 that killed 47 people in Lac Megantic, Quebec, and the June 2016 derailment of a Union-Pacific train that spilled 42,000 gallons of oil near Mosier, Oregon.     The state's new rule requires facilities that receive crude oil by rail to notify the state in advance. Information about shipments is shared with emergency managers in areas along the route. The Department of Ecology later publishes quarterly reports summarizing the volumes.     The rule also applies to pipelines, which report twice yearly.     ___

U.S. equities gained amid speculation Donald Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress will pursue business-friendly policies. The knee-jerk sell-off of risky assets began to abate as Trump, 70, promised to try to unite America's divided political factions after his victory over Hillary Clinton.""This is quite a reversal from midnight last night,"" said Matt Sallee, who helps manage $15 billion in oil-related assets at Tortoise Capital Advisors in Leawood, Kansas. ""We're still coming to grips with the implications of the election. A consensus may be forming that fiscal stimulus, lower taxes and a loose monetary policy will be good for growth.""The result nonetheless rattled markets that had banked on a continuation of economic and trade policies under a Democratic president. Most polls had shown Clinton ahead of Trump going into the vote and websites that took bets on the victor had put her odds of winning at 80% or more.West Texas Intermediate for December delivery rose 29 cents to settle at $45.27 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Trump has pledged to clamp down on immigration to the U.S. and renegotiate free-trade agreements with countries including Mexico.""I don't think President Trump will have a big impact on oil demand or output,"" said Mike Wittner, head of oil-market research at Societe Generale in New York. ""He's made statements, but we haven't seen any thought-out policies.

A 2 million-barrel gain was forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, and a 4.4 million increase was reported Tuesday by the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute.""The market is in wait-and-see mode,"" said Tim Pickering, founder and chief investment officer of Auspice Capital Advisors Ltd. in Calgary. ""We can look forward to a lot of volatility as the policies and plans of the Trump administration are formulated.Oil retreated below $45 a barrel following the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' failure to agree on output quotas for member countries on Oct. 28. The group must reach a consensus before finalizing its September deal to cut production. OPEC's chief warned of prolonged market instability if there is no agreement to limit supply.""We're going to be focused about the demand impact of the election in the short run,"" said Chip Hodge, who oversees a $12 billion natural-resource bond portfolio as senior managing director at John Hancock in Boston.

Agricultural commodities declined while industrial metals rebounded from earlier losses and gold surged with haven assets.Crude oil futures overcame early losses to join the stock market rally Wednesday.

(Nasdaq: CRZO) today announced the Company’s financial results for the second quarter of 2018 and provided an operational update, which includes the following highlights:  Total production of 57,077 Boe/d, 12% above the second quarter of 2017 and above the high-end of the Company’s guidance range Crude oil production of 37,860 Bbls/d, 13% above the second quarter of 2017 and 11% above the first quarter of 2018 Net income attributable to common shareholders of $30.1 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, and Net cash provided by operating activities of $137.1 million Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders of $66.6 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, and Adjusted EBITDA of $178.9 million Multiple Delaware Basin Wolfcamp A wells that achieved crude oil production rates of more than 1,000 Bbls/d on restricted chokes Signed a deal with a major crude purchaser that provides 100% flow assurance for Delaware Basin crude oil production through mid-2020 with no minimum volume commitments Shifting capital to the Eagle Ford Shale from the Delaware Basin in order to capitalize on the superior margins and rates of return being generated  Carrizo reported second quarter of 2018 net income attributable to common shareholders of $30.1 million, or $0.37 and $0.36 per basic and diluted share, respectively, compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $56.3 million, or $0.86 and $0.85 per basic and diluted share, respectively in the second quarter of 2017. The net income attributable to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2018 and the second quarter of 2017 include certain items typically excluded from published estimates by the investment community. Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders, which excludes the impact of these items as described in the non-GAAP reconciliation tables included below, for the second quarter of 2018 was $66.6 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, compared to $20.0 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2017.   For the second quarter of 2018, Adjusted EBITDA was $178.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation to net income attributable to common shareholders are presented in the non-GAAP reconciliation tables included below.   Production volumes during the second quarter of 2018 were 5,193 MBoe, or 57,077 Boe/d, an increase of 12% versus the second quarter of 2017. The year-over-year comparison is impacted by a significant amount of acquisition and divestiture (A&D) activity, including the acquisition of properties in the Delaware Basin and the divestiture of the Company’s Appalachia, DJ Basin, and downdip Eagle Ford Shale assets. Pro forma for this A&D activity, the Company’s production increased by more than 30% versus the second quarter of 2017, driven by development in the Eagle Ford Shale and Delaware Basin. Crude oil production during the second quarter of 2018 averaged 37,860 Bbls/d, an increase of 13% versus the second quarter of 2017; natural gas and NGL production were 59,029 Mcf/d and 9,379 Bbls/d, respectively, during the second quarter of 2018. Second quarter of 2018 production exceeded the high end of the Company’s guidance range of 53,800-54,800 Boe/d.   Drilling, completion, and infrastructure capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2018 were $218.0 million. Nearly 55% of the second quarter drilling, completion, and infrastructure spending was in the Delaware Basin, with the balance in the Eagle Ford Shale. Land and seismic expenditures during the quarter were $6.1 million, and were primarily focused in the Delaware Basin.   In early July, Carrizo closed on the divestiture of non-operated assets in its Ford West area of the Delaware Basin. The divested assets included approximately 1,700 net acres and had associated net production during the second quarter of 2018 of approximately 820 Boe/d (34% oil, 62% liquids).   Given the relative outlook for crude oil prices in the Eagle Ford Shale and Delaware Basin over the next 18 months, Carrizo has elected to shift capital to the Eagle Ford Shale in order to take advantage of the superior returns offered from the play in the current environment. At the end of the first quarter, Carrizo was running four rigs in the Delaware Basin and two rigs in the Eagle Ford Shale. The Company moved one of its rigs to the Eagle Ford Shale during the second quarter and recently added a fourth rig to the play. For the balance of the year, Carrizo currently plans to run an average of six rigs, with four located in the Eagle Ford Shale and two located in the Delaware Basin, and two to three completion crews. Given the faster cycle times in the Eagle Ford Shale, as well as the Company’s decision to maintain a six-rig program for the remainder of the year, Carrizo now expects to drill 123-132 gross (112-121 net) operated wells and complete 108-117 gross (93-102 net) operated wells during the year. This compares to the Company’s estimate of 93-103 gross (82-91 net) operated wells drilled and 113-123 gross (96-105 net) operated wells completed under the prior plan. As a result of the increased drilling activity, Carrizo is increasing its 2018 drilling, completion, and infrastructure capital expenditure guidance to $800-$825 million from $750-$800 million.   Despite the impact of the Company’s non-operated divestiture as well as its expectation of an accelerated payout at the Brown Trust multipad as described below, Carrizo is maintaining the upper end of its 2018 production guidance range and tightening it to 58,700-60,100 Boe/d from 58,500-60,100 Boe/d. Crude oil is still expected to account for 65%-67% of the Company’s production for the year, while total liquids are expected to account for 81%-84%. This equates to annual production growth of more than 10% using the midpoint of the range. Pro forma for the Company’s A&D activity, 2018 guidance equates to year-over-year production growth of more than 30%, with crude oil production growth of more than 20%. For the third quarter of the year, Carrizo expects production to be 62,000-63,000 Boe/d; crude oil is expected to account for 65% of production, while total liquids are expected to account for 82%. A full summary of Carrizo’s guidance is provided in the attached tables.   Based on the Company’s expectation that additional pipeline capacity out of the Permian Basin will be operational in late 2019, resulting in a more normalized spread between local oil prices in the Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin, Carrizo currently expects to begin shifting activity back to the Delaware Basin in the second half of 2019. Carrizo maintains a significant amount of flexibility to shift capital between its plays in 2019; thus, should the announced pipelines be delayed causing local Permian Basin oil prices to remain weak, the Company has the flexibility and inventory depth to keep its activity weighted to the Eagle Ford Shale.   S.P. “Chip” Johnson, IV, Carrizo’s President and CEO, commented on the results, “The second quarter was another outstanding operational and financial quarter for the Company as we delivered production 4% above the high end of our guidance range, operating expenses 3% below the low end of our guidance range, and expanded our EBITDA margin by 17% from the first quarter to $34/Boe. During the quarter, we also successfully executed our initial capital shift from the Delaware Basin to the Eagle Ford Shale, where our margins benefit from premium Gulf Coast pricing.   “The current environment highlights the advantages of having complementary acreage positions in the Eagle Ford Shale and Delaware Basin. While we had previously taken steps to protect our Delaware Basin margins, such as placing basis hedges on a large percentage of our expected 2018 oil production at a $0.10 differential to NYMEX, we were able to quickly shift capital to the Eagle Ford Shale once it appeared that Permian Basin differentials were deteriorating sooner and to a greater degree than we had previously expected. This pivot allows us to avoid aggressively developing our valuable Delaware Basin inventory during a period of weak local market prices while at the same time enhancing our overall financial metrics as returns in the Eagle Ford Shale are significantly higher than returns in the Delaware Basin based on current strip prices.   “While our new plan should result in higher EBITDA during 2018, the bigger benefit should be realized in 2019. Our new plan allows us to build our inventory of drilled, uncompleted wells in the Eagle Ford Shale up to more than 40 by year-end, setting us up for strong growth from the play in 2019. We currently expect the Eagle Ford Shale to be the primary driver of our production growth next year. And with the higher margins that are expected to be generated by Eagle Ford Shale production based on current strip prices, we believe our new plan should result in more than $100 million of incremental EBITDA through the end of 2019. This should accelerate our leverage reduction as well as enhance our ROCE.   “Our decision to shift capital out of the Delaware Basin is entirely a returns-focused, economical decision given weak regional pricing. We continue to be very pleased with the results from our Delaware Basin position and are in an excellent position from a midstream standpoint. We recently executed a deal with a major crude purchaser that provides us with flow assurance for 100% of our oil production through mid-2020 while not subjecting us to any minimum volume commitments. Our wells continue to deliver strong results, as we brought online multiple Wolfcamp A wells during the quarter that achieved crude oil production rates of more than 1,000 Bbls/d on restricted chokes.”   Operational Update   In the Eagle Ford Shale, where the Company holds approximately 77,300 net acres, Carrizo drilled 19 gross (18 net) operated wells during the second quarter and completed 18 gross (16 net) operated wells. Production from the play was more than 37,000 Boe/d, up 4% versus the prior quarter as production from new wells, including the Brown Trust multipad, more than offset the impact of the downdip asset sale during the prior quarter. Crude oil production during the second quarter was nearly 29,200 Bbls/d, accounting for 79% of the Company’s production from the play. At the end of the quarter, Carrizo had 15 gross (14 net) operated Eagle Ford Shale wells waiting on completion. Carrizo currently expects to drill 95-100 gross (90-95 net) operated wells and complete 85-90 gross (75-80 net) operated wells in the play during 2018.   Production from the Company’s first large-scale multipad project in the Eagle Ford Shale, located in its Brown Trust project area, continues to be strong. Production from the multipad has now been online for more than 120 days, and continues to produce more than 14,000 Boe/d (88% oil) on restricted chokes. The multipad consists of 16 wells on three pads, with an average lateral length of approximately 9,100 ft. and frac stage spacing of 150-180 ft. Given the strong performance from this project, as well as higher-than-expected commodity prices, the multipad is now expected to pay out during the second half of 2018 versus the Company’s prior expectation of early 2019. Upon payout, Carrizo’s average working interest in the wells will decline to 54% from 79%. The expected impact of this is a reduction to the Company’s full-year 2018 production of more than 200 Boe/d.   In the Delaware Basin, where it holds approximately 36,300 net acres, Carrizo drilled 9 gross (8 net) operated wells during the second quarter and completed 12 gross (9 net) operated wells. Production from the play was approximately 19,800 Boe/d for the quarter, up 30% versus the prior quarter. Crude oil production during the second quarter was approximately 8,500 Bbls/d, accounting for 43% of the Company’s production from the play. At the end of the quarter, Carrizo had 10 gross (9 net) operated Delaware Basin wells waiting on completion. Carrizo currently expects to drill 28-32 gross (22-26 net) operated wells and complete 23-27 gross (18-22 net) operated wells in the play during 2018.   During the second quarter, Carrizo’s completion activity was weighted towards wells drilled in the Wolfcamp A, with multiple wells achieving crude oil production rates of more than 1,000 Bbls/d on restricted chokes. Wolfcamp A highlights from the Company’s primary Phantom area block include the following:  the Dorothy Unit 38 11H achieved a peak 30-day rate of more than 2,200 Boe/d (50% oil, 76% liquids) from an approximate 11,000-ft. lateral the Woodson 36 Allocation A 11H achieved a peak 30-day rate of more than 2,400 Boe/d (49% oil, 75% liquids) from an approximate 9,800-ft. lateral three Zeman wells which have thus far achieved an average peak 30-day rate of more than 2,050 Boe/d (45% oil, 73% liquids) from an average lateral of approximately 7,600 ft.  Two of the wells the Company drilled this quarter, the Zeman 40 Allocation C 11H and Dorothy 11H, were vertical stack tests of Wolfcamp A over existing Lower Wolfcamp B. The Zeman 11H was drilled over an existing Lower Wolfcamp B well that had been online for approximately 13 months. The vertical separation between the wells was approximately 460 ft. The Dorothy 11H was drilled over an existing Lower Wolfcamp B well that had been online for approximately eight months. The vertical separation between the wells was approximately 445 ft. Carrizo is very encouraged by the early results of these tests.   Carrizo also recently brought a very encouraging Wolfcamp A well online in its northeastern Phantom area acreage in Ward County. The SRO 551 Allocation A 100H began production in July, and while it has yet to achieve a peak 30-day rate, production has recently been more than 2,400 Boe/d (41% oil, 71% liquids) on a restricted choke from an approximate 7,400-ft. lateral. Carrizo’s estimate of net de-risked drilling locations does not currently include many locations on this acreage position.   The Company has continued to enhance its portfolio of midstream contracts. Carrizo recently executed a deal with a major crude purchaser that provides it with flow assurance on 100% of its Delaware Basin crude oil production at a Midland-based price. The term of the contract is from September 2018 through July 2020, providing the Company with additional flow protection until new pipelines come online. Importantly, the agreement does not contain any minimum volume commitments, allowing Carrizo to maintain the flexibility to allocate capital between its plays in order to maximize its returns. For its natural gas production, Carrizo has continued to work with its third-party gas purchaser to increase firm capacity to WAHA and other points out of the basin. Carrizo and its third-party purchaser have currently executed contracts that have expanded firm takeaway to 60-65 MMcf/d from November 2018 through October 2019 and to 40-45 MMcf/d from November 2019 through March 2020. As the Company’s third-party gathering solution connects to multiple outlets that provide access to Mexico, the West Coast, or the Gulf Coast, Carrizo remains confident that it will be able to market its gas production.   Hedging Activity   Carrizo currently has hedges in place for approximately 70% of estimated crude oil production for the remainder of 2018 (based on the midpoint of guidance); the Company’s 2018 crude oil hedge portfolio includes both swaps and three-way collars. For 2019, the Company has three-way collars covering 15,000 Bbls/d. Additionally, Carrizo has swap contracts in place for more than 45% and 35% of its estimated NGL and natural gas production, respectively, for the remainder of 2018.   In order to further manage its commodity price exposure, Carrizo has also put various basis hedges in place. For the balance of the year, Carrizo has basis swaps locking in a $0.10/Bbl Midland-Cushing differential on 6,000 Bbls/d. The Company also has basis swaps locking in a $5.11/Bbl LLS-Cushing premium on 18,000 Bbls/d over the same period.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES   (Unaudited)   Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders (GAAP) to Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders (Non-GAAP)   Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders is a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes certain items that are included in net income attributable to common shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Items excluded are those which the Company believes affect the comparability of operating results and are typically excluded from published estimates by the investment community, including items whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated or are non-recurring.   Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders is presented because management believes it provides useful additional information to investors for analysis of the Company’s fundamental business on a recurring basis. In addition, management believes that adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders is widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry.   Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income attributable to common shareholders or any other measure of a company’s financial performance or profitability presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the differences between net income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders is presented below. Because adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income attributable to common shareholders and may vary among companies, our calculation of adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

CARRIZO OIL & GAS, INC.   NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES   (Unaudited)   Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders (GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) to Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (GAAP)   Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes certain items that are included in net income attributable to common shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Items excluded are interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, impairments, dividends and accretion on preferred stock and items that the Company believes affect the comparability of operating results such as items whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated or are non-recurring.   Adjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes it provides useful additional information to investors and analysts, for analysis of the Company’s financial and operating performance on a recurring basis and the Company’s ability to internally generate funds for exploration and development, and to service debt. In addition, management believes that adjusted EBITDA is widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry.   Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income attributable to common shareholders, net cash provided by operating activities, or any other measure of a company’s profitability or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of net income attributable to common shareholders to adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities is presented below. Because adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income attributable to common shareholders, our calculations of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.   Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (GAAP) to Discretionary Cash Flows (Non-GAAP)   Discretionary cash flows are a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes certain items that are included in net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Items excluded are changes in the components of working capital and other items that the Company believes affect the comparability of operating cash flows such as items that are non-recurring.   Discretionary cash flows are presented because management believes it provides useful additional information to investors for analysis of the Company’s ability to generate cash to fund exploration and development, and to service debt. In addition, management believes that discretionary cash flows is widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry.   Discretionary cash flows should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of a company’s cash flows or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.

But reports began to mount this year that the kingdom was looking at further delays and a more limited scope.In March, sources told the Financial Times that it would likely to be pushed back to next year or possibly later. Later that month, sources told the Wall Street Journal that Aramco would hold off on an international IPO and instead list on a domestic exchange next year.In May, Saudi Arabia's energy minster said the IPO will ""most likely"" happen next year, but it depends on the oil market.Oil prices have come off their July highs, but were up sharply Wednesday on the bullish inventory report. Brent oil prices climbed 3% to finish at $74.78 per barrel.

[ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,201703281150PR.NEWS.USPR.NY47909,Regional Business News,"Natixis, IBM and Trafigura introduce first-ever Blockchain solution for U.S. crude oil market","NEW YORK, March 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Natixis, IBM and Trafigura have pioneered the first blockchain solution in commodity trade finance for US crude oil transactions. The distributed ledger platform, built on the Linux Foundation open source Hyperledger Fabric, allows major steps in a crude oil transaction to be digitized on the blockchain, ensuring improved transparency, enhanced security, and optimized efficiency.By having the buyer, seller and their respective banks all on the same ledger, all parties can simultaneously view and share data on the status of a transaction, from the time a new trade is confirmed and validated, to when the crude oil is inspected, to its final delivery and cancellation of the letter of credit.Key benefits of the solution include reduced cash cycle times, improved efficiency via lower overhead costs and fewer cost intermediaries, increased transaction visibility to help reduce the threat of tampering, fraud and cyber-crime, and the creation of transparent transactions by using shared processes and recordkeeping.This initiative is part of a broader effort to modernize trading in the global crude oil industry, which today is predominantly driven by manual, non-digital processes.""Natixis wants to use blockchain to enhance client service by optimizing the antiquated arena of commodity trade finance,"" said Arnaud Stevens, Natixis' New York Head of Global Energy &amp; Commodities. ""The current process is paper and labor intensive, we have multiple friction points with high processing costs and limited automation. Distributed ledger technology brings some much-needed innovation into our industry.""The new trading platform allows trade documents, shipment updates, delivery and payment status to be shared across a single shared ledger, helping to reduce transaction time, duplication of documents and authentication processes among all trading partners. Traditionally these transactions require complex workflows and paper-based processes in which documentation is shared through courier, fax and email exchange. The solution, which is hosted on IBM's cloud platform, Bluemix, was led and delivered by IBM France.""Processes in the energy and commodities trade business are ripe for improvement,"" said James Wallis, Vice President, blockchain markets and engagements, IBM. ""The approach we are taking, using a permissioned blockchain network built on the Hyperledger Fabric, has the potential to transform the crude oil industry by creating consistency in trade finance and by digitizing transactions and information sharing. Creating this ecosystem for the commodities market working with two world leaders in this industry will help create an entirely new approach to managing the global commodities trade.""The platform will soon be expanded to allow all parties in the transaction to enter data directly onto the blockchain. For example, the shipping company, pipeline operator, inspector or warehouse can provide real-time status updates via the blockchain on the crude oil transaction, helping lower the risk of fraudulent transactions. More importantly, the distributed ledger for crude oil transactions is designed to be adopted at scale across the entire industry. By creating a shared permissioned ledger for use across all trading partners, including multiple buyers, sellers, banks and trading partners, even further efficiencies can be anticipated.""Together with Natixis and IBM, we have analyzed the workflow of crude oil transactions in the US, detailing the different steps of a transaction, our interactions with the financial institutions and the documents exchanged among the various parties,"" said Rodney Malcolm, Trafigura Trading's North American Chief Financial Officer. ""The goal is to replace paper-heavy manual processes with blockchain-based workflows to improve transparency and data sharing. With the distributed ledger technology, all transaction participants in the network are updated simultaneously with a record that cannot be altered or tampered with. Each change or new transaction immediately creates a new record in the shared ledger.""Natixis' CIB Head of Digital, Frederic Dalibard said, ""This partnership with IBM and Trafigura represents great momentum for Natixis and supports our aim to move distributed ledger technology from vision to execution.""About NatixisNatixis is the international corporate, investment, insurance and financial services arm of Groupe BPCE, the 2nd-largest banking group in France with 31.2 million clients spread over two retail banking networks, Banque Populaire and Caisse d'Epargne.With more than 16,000 employees, Natixis has a number of areas of expertise that are organized into three main business lines: Corporate &amp; Investment Banking, Investment Solutions &amp; Insurance, and Specialized Financial Services.A global player, Natixis has its own client base of companies, financial institutions and institutional investors as well as the client base of individuals, professionals and small and medium-size businesses of Groupe BPCE's banking networks.Listed on the Paris stock exchange, it has a solid financial base with a CET1 capital under Basel 3(1) of €12.7 billion, a Basel 3 CET1 Ratio(1) of 11% and quality long-term ratings (Standard &amp; Poor's: A / Moody's: A2 / Fitch Ratings: A).(1)Based on CRR-CRD4 rules as reported on June 26, 2013, including the Danish compromise - without phase-in except for DTAs on tax-loss carry forwards following ECB regulation 2016/445.Figures as at December 31, 2016.

New leaks have been discovered in a Nigerian pipeline that's been shut since late last week and the operator provided no estimate for when deliveries will resume. Meanwhile, Iraq joined Iran and Venezuela in panning Saudi Arabian suggestions that it's time to unwind output caps.The Nigerian outage involves ""a big pipe, big delivery point,"" said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York. At the same time, any signals that major producers like the Saudis are boosting output are ""going to tend to weigh on the market.""The self-discipline of the OPEC-led coalition that adopted historic supply restraints in early 2017 may already be slipping. Russia lifted crude output 140,000 barrels a day above its cap in the first week of June, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Saudi Arabia raised production last month to the highest since October, according to a person familiar with the kingdom's disclosures to the cartel.Russia and the Saudi kingdom have signaled they may formally propose a gradual production increase when OPEC and allies gather in Vienna on June 22-23.Yet, Iraqi Oil Minister Jabbar al-Luaibi said OPEC and allied producers haven't reached their objectives and shouldn't be influenced by calls to pump more oil.West Texas intermediate crude for July delivery climbed 36 cents to settle at $66.10 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 24% below the 100-day average.Brent futures for August settlement ended the session unchanged at $76.46 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, and traded at a $10.43 premium to WTI for the same month.In the U.S., stockpiles stored at the pipeline complex in Cushing, Okla., fell by an estimated 900,000 barrels last week, according to a forecast compiled by Bloomberg.By BLOOMBERG NEWSCopyright of Investors Business Daily is the property of Investor's Business Daily and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

It states thatoilprices has dropped on June 6, 2018 following an increase on domestic production andcrudestockpiles in the U.S. It mentions that the state-runoilcompany Petróleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) of Venezuela warned for possible freeze on somecrudeexports following a drop onoilproduction caused by Venezuela's worsening economic crisis.",1300,130008387,Regional Business News,Oil Prices Fall Despite Inventory Shock; Production Hits 10.8 Million.,"Oil prices finished lower Wednesday after a surprise increase in U.S. crude stockpiles and another increase in domestic production.Crude stockpiles rose by 2.1 million barrels and gasoline supplies rose by 4.6 million barrels. Domestic production rose to 10.8 million barrels per day from 10.77 million bpd in the prior week.Analysts polled by S&P Global Platts expected a 1.3 million-barrel drop in crude supplies and a 600,000-barrel drop in gasoline stockpiles.Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute reported a 2 million-barrel drop in weekly crude stockpiles. The industry group saw a 3.8 million-barrel increase in gasoline stockpiles.U.S. crude fell 1.2% to settle at a two-month low of $64.81 a barrel, while Brent pared losses to end just 2 cents lower at $75.36. Exxon Mobil  (XOM) closed up 1.7% on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) edged up 0.5%, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) added 0.5% and BP (BP) finished flat.Earlier, Venezuela's state-run oil producer PDVSA said it may halt some crude exports and could declare force majeure, meaning it won't be able to fulfill supply contracts, sources told Reuters.Production has plummeted out of Venezuela as its economic crisis worsens. The steep drop in output is one of the reasons OPEC and Russia are reconsidering the 1.8 million production cut.But markets are continuing to process reports Tuesday saying the Trump administration asked OPEC and Russia to boost oil output by 1 million barrels per day as gasoline prices reached their highest mark in over three years, according to a Bloomberg.The surge in gasoline prices came in part after President Trump announced the U.S. was leaving the nuclear agreement. This would reimpose sanctions on Iran's crude exports, which amounted to 1 million barrels per day.Easing production cuts will be the big topic at the OPEC and Russia meeting later this month. But the countries must settle differences on the size of the increase.Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies only want to raise output by 300,000 barrels per day, but Russia favors raising production by 800,000 bpd, sources told Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Reuters sources said the two sides are looking at raising production by 1 million bpd.By GILLIAN RICHCopyright of Investors Business Daily is the property of Investor's Business Daily and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

Increasing global population and subsequent demand for crude oil and its by-products is expected to drive the industry over the forecast period. Carriers provide a convenient and economical way to transport liquid bulk, facilitating international seaborne trade.Growing demand for bulk oil transportation services and facilities, mainly from extraction locations to refineries is likely to contribute to increasing product demand. Longer hauls and fewer triangulation options or backhaul routes to reduce ballasting are also likely to present growth opportunities for industry participants. Healthy carriers demand owing to recent low prices and greater refinery output is also likely to complement market growth.Full research report on crude oil carrier market analysis:http://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/crude-oil-carrier-marketExponential economic growth of various developed and developing countries such as the U.S., Germany, the UK, China, India, UAE, etc. has driven product demand for fuel generation and as feedstock for chemical production. Globalization and rapid industrialization in numerous world economies is further expected to boost demand for crude oil and its by-products. Ongoing low global oil prices and high supply from OPEC countries are expected to boost tanker or carriers demand over the forecast period.Positive carrier fleet fundamentals as compared to historical averages, coupled with increased crude oil stockpiling owing to low prices in OECD and non-OECD regions is anticipated to drive carrier demand. Low bunker fuel prices are likely to spur increased earnings, leading to greater carrier application and demand across the globe. Demand for Crude Oil Carrier has remained strong despite seasonal fluctuations owing to delay of other vessels in certain regions on account of weather and overloaded onshore storage tanks.Get more information on Global Endoscopy Market or request for TOC of this research report at:http://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/crude-oil-carrier-market/request-tocHowever, high logistics costs and decreasing oil imports from regions that are tapping into renewable resources such as solar power are likely to hamper market growth over the forecast period. High cost of capital required to acquire new or second hand carrier ships is also likely to restrict market entry.The market can be segmented on the basis of dead weight tonnage (DWT) or capacity as, Suezmax, Panamax, Aframax, Small, Medium, Ultra Large Crude Carriers (ULCC) and Very large crude carriers (VLCC). ULCCs and VLCCs have extremely high carrying capacity of over 250,000 DWT, allowing crude transportation of upto 550,000 DWT. However, medium tankers have been estimated to dominate the market in recent years, especially among high oil exporting countries across the Middle East.View more reports of this category by Grand View Research at:http://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry/construction-and-utilitiesAbout Grand View ResearchGrand View Research, Inc. is a U.S. based market research and consulting company, registered in the State of California and headquartered in San Francisco.

Hedge funds upped their short position in West Texas Intermediate crude by the most ever for the week ended July 26, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data going back to 2006. The large short position leaves the market vulnerable to a quick rally, according to analysts.""The boat was loaded very heavily to one side in terms of a lot of shorts in the market,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital, a New York hedge fund focused on energy.Short positions in the U.S. benchmark rose 28%, with an increase of 38,897 futures and options combined, in the week ended July 26, according to the CFTC. Longs, or bets on rising oil prices, increased by 0.9%. Net longs tumbled 23% to the lowest since February.Oil rebounded after tumbling more than 20% into a bear market, closing below $40 a barrel on Tuesday for the first time since April. Analysts from Citigroup to Bank of America Merrill Lynch predicted the slump would be short-lived, while Societe Generale said the price correction would be limited due to a better balance between supply and demand.WTI for September delivery rose $1.10 to settle at $41.93 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was up about 20% from the 100-day average.Brent for October settlement climbed $1.19 to close at $44.29 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark settled at a $1.60 premium to WTI for October delivery.""We had a very big correction earlier, and it might have been overdone,"" said Mike Wittner, head of oil market research at Societe Generale in New York. ""Global fundamentals are balanced. We're not oversupplied the way we were in the first quarter.""U.S. crude output decreased by 55,000 barrels a day to 8.46 million a day in the week ended July 29, the EIA reported Wednesday. Stockpiles at Cushing, Okla., the delivery point for WTI and the nation's biggest storage hub, fell the most in six weeks.Nationwide crude inventories expanded by 1.4 million barrels to 522.5 million, keeping supplies more than 100 million barrels above the five-year average. Gasoline stockpiles, which slipped to 238.2 million barrels, remain 23 million barrels above the five-year average.Two oil-export ports in Mexico were closed ahead of a storm, according to a statement by Mexico's merchant marine. The tropical storm, Earl, was 90 miles west of Belize City with top winds of 65 miles per hour, down from 80 mph earlier, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in an 8 a.m. advisory. The storm is forecast to skirt the southern edge of the Bay of Campeche on Friday as a depression, the weakest tropical system.Oil prices rose Thursday as traders covered bearish positions.

The drop incrudestocks is attributed to the decrease in imports after the storm delayed ships going into Louisiana and Texas. Also discussed is the concern that members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia would introduce measures to stabilize the market.,1360,117964474,Regional Business News,Oil Rises As Industry Data Signal Drop In U.S. Crude Stockpiles.,"FuturesOil advanced as industry data showed a big decline in U.S. crude inventories last week, trimming stockpiles that are at the highest seasonal level in at least 30 years.Futures rose as much as 2.4% in New York. Crude supplies fell by 12.1 million barrels, the American Petroleum Institute was said to report. Energy Information Administration data are forecast to show a 905,000-barrel gain, according to a Bloomberg survey. Tropical Storm Hermine moved into the Gulf of Mexico on Aug. 28, disrupting shipping and output before moving northeast. A meeting of global producers this month will come too early for Iran to discuss freezing output, an official from the nation's state oil company said.""Obviously, the market is moving on the API number,"" said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. ""Production was down because of a storm and imports were probably disrupted. Analysts must have forgotten how much of an impact a storm in the Gulf can have.""Oil rallied in August partly on speculation that members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia would agree on measures to stabilize the market.

The global oilfield equipment rental market to grow at a CAGR of 4.76% during the period 2017-2021.   The report, Global Oilfield Equipment Rental Market 2017-2021, has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market.   The latest trend gaining momentum in the market is emerging offshore opportunities. The offshore oil and gas industry has faced numerous challenges that include high operational costs that have been exacerbated by lower global oil prices. Since 2015, low global oil prices have forced the international oil companies (IOCs) to decrease their investments in offshore development.   According to the report, one of the major drivers for this market is development of unconventional oil and gas resources/hydrocarbon exploration. Though the major hydrocarbon-rich regions in the world were identified in the early 20th century, the E&P companies are now focusing on unconventional areas for exploration and production purposes. These unconventional resources are the oil and gas bearing reservoirs that cannot be extracted economically.

The global market size of COFI is estimated to reach USD 1.73 billion by 2021 from 1.32 billion in 2016, at a CAGR of 5.5%.   Excessive supply of oil worldwide, has pushed down oil prices. Countries such as the U.S. have made considerable investments in unconventional drilling technologies, such as hydraulic fracturing (fracking). Hence, the U.S. cannot afford to cut down production so as to reduce dependency on shale oil import and subsequently reducing the price of the end product.   Crude oil production through processes such as fracking requires addition of large quantities of flow improvers at various stages. Major countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Iraq have increased their oil production, to protect their market share. Hence, demand for COFI is expected to increase.   With the removal of sanctions on Iran, various International Oil Companies (IOCs) are willing to invest in the country which is offering around 50 oil & gas projects and 18 energy & power blocks worth USD 185 million by 2020. The political situations in countries such as Nigeria and Libya are expected to smoothen in the coming years that will result in ramping up crude oil production from these nations. This is expected to drive the demand for COFI products from these countries.

These include sooner-than-anticipated resumption of exports by the Islamic Republic of Iran, greater resilience in U.S. production due to cost cuts and efficiency gains, a mild winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and weak growth prospects in major emerging market economies, according to the World Bank's latest quarterly report.Oil prices fell by 47 percent in 2015 and are expected to decline, on an annual average, by another 27 percent in 2016. However, from their current lows, a gradual recovery in oil prices is expected over the course of the year, for several reasons. First, the sharp oil price drop in early 2016 does not appear fully warranted by fundamental drivers of oil demand and supply, and is likely to partly reverse. Second, high-cost oil producers are expected to sustain persistent losses and increasingly make production cuts that are likely to outweigh any additional capacity coming to the market. Third, demand is expected to strengthen somewhat with a modest pickup in global growth.The anticipated oil price recovery is forecast to be smaller than the rebounds that followed sharp drops in 2008, 1998, and 1986. The price outlook remains subject to considerable downside risks.“Low prices for oil and commodities are likely to be with us for some time,” said John Baffes, Senior Economist and lead author of the Commodities Markets Outlook. “While we see some prospect for commodity prices to rise slightly over the next two years, significant downside risks remain.”//Petra// AACopyright 2016 by Jordanian News Agency Distributed by UPICopyright of Arabia 2000 is the property of Arabia 2000.

[ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,bizwire.c71374248,Regional Business News,Global Crude Oil Pipelines Market to Witness Growth Through 2020 Owing to Significant Increase in Demand from APAC: Technavio," The global crude oil pipelines market is projected to experience a significantly tepid growth rate throughout the forecast period, registering a CAGR of only 0.3%, according to Technavio’s latest report.   In this report, Technavio covers the market outlook and growth prospects of the globalcrude oil pipelinesmarketfor 2016-2020. This report covers and analyzes the global crude oil pipeline market involved in the collection and transportation of crude oil from production sites in upstream fields to refining facilities worldwide.   “The market is expected to be driven by factors such as the shift in the exploration base of crude oil supplies and increasing collaboration between various nations. These key drivers of the market are projected to be in line with the ongoing trend of securing unconventional reserve assets in the oil and gas industry,” says Thanikachalam Chandrasekaran, a lead oil and gas research expert from Technavio.   Technavio’s energy research analysts segment the global crude oil pipelines market into the following regions:  Americas EMEA APAC  In 2015, with a market share of over 58%, Americas dominated the global crude oil pipelines market, followed by EMEA with around 29% and the APAC with approximately 13%.   Americas: largest length of crude oil pipeline in the world   The Americas is the world's second-largest consumer of crude oil owing to constant demand from the US, Canada, and Mexico. The US has been a leader in oil and gas exploits since the inception of the oil and gas industry. No other region can boast of the level of development in the oil and gas pipeline network, as seen in the US. Practically, the total length of crude oil pipelines in the Americas is more than the other two regions combined. This gives us a concrete idea about how mature the crude oil pipeline market is in the region. However, contrary to the inherent characteristic of slow growth in any mature market, the market in the Americas is still expanding.   Weighed down by the collapse of the upstream sector and lackluster demand figures, the crude oil pipeline market in the region is expected to expand at a CAGR of only 0.3% during the forecast period.

EMEA: abundant reserves of crude oil in the Middle East   EMEA has been a global hotspot for crude and natural gas production since the discovery of oil in the region in the 1950s. The region consists of countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, the UAE, and Kuwait. These nations have been at the forefront of oil production volumes for decades now. The major factor driving the growth of the crude oil pipeline network in the region is the monetization of abundant reserves available in the Middle East and their transportation within EMEA or outside.   However, the crude oil pipeline market is not expected to see any significant growth in the forecast period owing to the over-dependence of regional consumers on natural gas. With this fact in hindsight, EMEA is expected to see the slowest rate of expansion in the crude oil pipeline market and the lowest CAGR amounting to 0.1%.   APAC: immense growth potential for crude oil pipeline   For the most part of the last century, APAC had been on the back foot in terms of activities related to energy resources. These low exploit levels were in tandem with the low levels of economic activities in the region. However, since the 1980s new economic powerhouses came up in the region, resulting in sudden increase in demand. As a result, APAC had to rely on imports either through pipelines or marine vessels. The presence of energy guzzlers like China, India, Japan, and South Korea has driven the growth of the regional pipeline market in the recent past. The demand, primarily from these countries, is expected to keep the crude oil pipeline market in the region chugging along.   The total length of the crude oil pipelines in the region was 64.62 thousand miles in 2015 and is expected to reach 67.28 thousand miles in 2020 at a CAGR of 0.8%. “The low cumulative growth rate indicated for the forecast period in APAC does not justify the immense growth potential that this region encapsulates. With the rising parity of the growing economics like India and China in the tow, the region is expected to see a significant rise in pipeline construction activities in the future,” says Thanikachalam.

The global crude oil market is anticipated to witness a significant growth rate during the forecast period. The crude oil market is segregated on the basis of end use products including jet fuel, gasoline, LPG, diesel fuel & heating oil, asphalt and other products. Amongst the various end use products, gasoline holds the largest market share owing to its rising demand from automotive sector.   The crude oil market is significantly driven by the growth in population and rising demand from petroleum industry. Increase in export of crude oil has also impacted the global crude oil market to a great extent.   The crude oil shipment was valued $786.3 billion in 2015 and this value is anticipated to increase in the upcoming scenario owing to rising need for electricity and its increasing application in varied industries. Moreover, increasing demand for crude oil from emerging market is expected to act as a significant growth opportunity for the global market. In 2015, India held third position in crude oil consumption with 195.5 million tons after U.S. and China.   During the same period, India imported approx. 195.1 million tons of crude oil and around 23.3 million tons refined petroleum products. The country has developed the surplus world class refining capacity by using the imported crude oil with the motive for exporting refined petroleum products. However, volatile crude oil prices and political unrest can hamper the growth of the global crude oil market.   Companies Mentioned:  Bp Global Chevron Corp. China National Petroleum Corp.

0,"Dallas Morning News, The (TX). 08/03/2016.",Article,,,,2W6760061363,Newspaper Source,How will the Texas economy be affected by crude oil back below $40 a barrel?,"Jeffrey Weiss     Aug. 03--For Texans, the news that domestic crude oil closed Tuesday below $40 a barrel for the first time in almost four months is a mixed bag: Not a shock to some analysts and more bad news than good.     The good news is easy to spot: the price for gasoline prices and other products based on petroleum will stay cheaper for consumers for a while. The bad news is more complicated: How much of a drag will it be on the Texas economy for a while? Will companies that depend on oil -- from the drillers to the restaurants drillers eat at -- slow hiring or cut jobs?     And how long is ""a while?""     ""The while could be quite a while,"" said Mine Y� 1/4 cel, senior vice president and director of research for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.     But she and other analysts say that depends on many factors and admit they have no crystal balls.     Here's a list of factors that analysts say are all pushing oil prices down now:     --International demand is down: That's largely because of slowing economies in China and India in particular.     --Global supplies are up: OPEC nations, including Saudi Arabia, have not cut production; disruptions in Canada and Nigeria have abated; Iran continues to ramp up its sales.     --The strong dollar. All kinds of products from abroad are cheaper. Since crude oil is an international market, that means the power of the dollar is one more drag on the price.     --Domestic production has improved: The cost of drilling in the U.S. shale has dropped dramatically in the past year, meaning that some companies have been able to keep drilling and pumping at relatively low prices. Last week, for instance, Irving-based Pioneer Natural Resources told investors that it had cut the costs of drilling in one part of the Permian Basin to $850 a lateral foot, down from $1,085 a year before and $1,300 for the end of 2014.     --U.S. demand is less than expected: There are some indications that Americans aren't driving as much as expected this summer. Another mild winter could further blunt demand.     On the up side? Production worldwide has dropped. So has drilling. Eventually, that means supply will taper off to meet demand. And eventually, that means prices will need to rise.     Count Texas Railroad Commissioner Ryan Sitton among those not shocked by the recent drop in prices. For a year or so, he's been saying that stable and higher prices wouldn't show up until late this year or early next year.     Eventually, he said, prices must rise because it's going to take more than $60 a barrel to support enough drilling to produce enough oil to fill the world's demand. But in the short term, Texas faces more suffering.     ""Unfortunately, you are still going to see companies that are highly leveraged continue to struggle,"" he said. ""There may be more layoffs to come. That is going to continue, but we expected it too.""     That's pretty much the position of the Dallas Federal Reserve analysts now.     Less than two weeks ago, the Dallas Federal Reserve offered a Texas jobs forecast that included this line: ""Increases in oil prices since the first quarter and their stability in recent months has led to some increased optimism in the oil patch.""     That tenuous optimism has likely evaporated in the recent price slide, said Michael Plante, a Dallas Fed senior research economist.     ""There were plenty of people who said they were not convinced yet,"" he said. ""That's going to reaffirm to a lot of these folks that it's not time to jump in and start hiring people.""     But the Texas economy is diverse enough that the latest slide isn't likely to have major effects, said Jim Glassman, managing director and head economist for commercial banking for JPMorgan Chase.     ""Texas has managed pretty well over the past year and a half when oil prices plunged from $100 per barrel to the current level and drilling activity plunged,"" he said. ""So I doubt the latest swoon in prices would pose as big a challenge as the state has already seen.""     As to what happens in a while? Glassman offered one hand and then the other:     "" U.S. production is beginning to drop off (it's down to 8.5 million barrels daily from the 9.5 million peak) and is likely to fall further. That is a reminder that the oversupply situation is likely to correct more quickly than many assume. At the same time, the efficiency of many operations is improving quickly, driving down the break-even costs of some of these projects.""     So which factor is going to win the tug-of-war on prices? Lower supply pushing up prices or better efficiency quickly pushing supply back up and prices back down?     ""That is a tricky question. I assume the cuts in production will swamp the drop in break-evens, because new projects have dropped off dramatically,"" he said. ""People have been puzzled why we haven't seen output come down very quickly, but my guess is that will be more visible in the coming year, even though the industry has been able to be profitable at lower prices.""

[ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,bizwire.c66057513,Regional Business News,NuStar and ConocoPhillips Loading Their First Export Cargo of U.S. Crude Oil After Lifting of Crude Oil Export Ban," On the heels of the U.S. government's recent lifting of the federal ban on the export of crude oil produced in the United States, NuStar Energy (NYSE: NS) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) announce they are loading what they believe to be the nation's first export cargo of U.S.-produced light crude oil since the 40-year-old ban was lifted on December 18.   ConocoPhillips committed to sell Eagle Ford light crude oil/condensate to international trading company Vitol. The cargo is expected to complete loading at NuStar's North Beach Terminal located in the Port of Corpus Christi on December 31, 2015.   NuStar has invested heavily in recent years to expand its South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System to move crude oil from the Eagle Ford Shale play to Corpus Christi. The company has also made major investments in its Corpus Christi terminal operations with the addition of more storage tanks, dock space and automated systems that allow the company to better accommodate and provide logistics services for its customers, including the ability to load export-size cargoes from its docks.   “Based on our investments in Corpus Christi and our South Texas pipeline system, NuStar was well-positioned, equipped and staffed to immediately begin loading cargoes for export,” said NuStar President and CEO Brad Barron. “And we plan on further expanding our Corpus Christi operations to provide more options to our customers to move Eagle Ford Shale crude oil, whether it is being moved domestically or internationally. In fact, we are currently in the process of developing a second private dock in the Port of Corpus Christi.”   Barron noted that with the new dock, NuStar would have access to four loading docks in the Port of Corpus Christi, including two private docks, and would be able to load crude oil onto ships simultaneously on all four docks at a maximum rate of 90,000 barrels per hour.   About NuStar Energy   NuStar Energy L.P., a publicly traded master limited partnership based in San Antonio, is one of the largest independent liquids terminal and pipeline operators in the nation. NuStar currently has approximately 8,700 miles of pipeline and 79 terminal and storage facilities that store and distribute crude oil, refined products and specialty liquids.

An average of 443,000 barrels of crude moved by rail during the first five months of this year, according to the Energy Information Administration. Nearly half of the crude carried by rail in May moved from the Midwest to East Coast refineries, which have increased their reliance upon petroleum imports.     With the worlwide fall in oil prices, the price of domestic crude oil produced in the Midwest and western Texas is no longer heavily discounted relative to imported crude. The narrower the spread between domestic and imported crude, the more likely coastal refiners will choose to run imported crudes rather than domestic supplies shipped by rail, EIA said.     amaykuth@phillynews.com     215-854-2947 @maykuth     ___

But refiners, he said, are not demanding as much crude oil right now, creating the buildup in inventories that fuels concerns about a prolonged stretch of lower prices.Eventually, oil producers will need to turn off the spigot to allow oil to rise.""Supply is what got us into this problem, and supply is probably going to have to get us out,"" Glickman said.The latest decline reflects a few key factors, analysts say:Stubbornly high U.S. oil inventories, which rose by 1.7 million barrels in the week ended July 22, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's Wednesday report.Signs of an uptick in Libya and Nigeria, where geopolitical disruptions had throttled production. However, that could be threatened by new U.S. airstrikes against Islamic State forces.Increased output in Canada following the devastating fire that slashed oil-sands production earlier this year.(c) USA TODAY,  2016 Source: USA Today, AUG 02, 2016Item: J0E181467101616"

""With Mexico's energy reform, a lot of things are different.""There is demand for Mexico's heavier crude as refineries in Louisiana and other Gulf states are fitted to process heavy crude, not the light stuff coming from the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin.But the export ban isn't in Moniz's ""bailiwick,"" and the Commerce Department needs to approve the deal.Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), Mexico's state-run oil company, applied for the swaps last year, though no updates have been given to the status of its request.But Mexico doesn't want to push the U.S. into speeding up the decision, according to Leonardo Beltran Rodriguez, Mexico's deputy secretary for planning and energy transition.The crude export ban has been in place since the 1970s and was designed to protect domestic energy supplies and reduce reliance on oil from the Middle East and other overseas players. But some shipments to Canada are allowed under the law, and exports of refined products aren't affected.While lifting the export ban outright might not come for several years, more exemptions are gaining momentum. Last June, the Commerce Department gave Pioneer Natural Resources ([STOCK[NYSE:PXD]]) and Enterprise Products Partners ([STOCK[NYSE:EPD]]) approval to export minimally processed condensate, a type of ultralight oil.Mexico is eager to improve energy relations with its northern neighbor. Rodriguez also emphasized how important ""integration"" is as it opens up its energy industry. Mexico is already working on building 10,000 kilometers of natural gas pipelines with the U.S.In December of 2013, Mexico declared the start of its energy reform, allowing Pemex to keep its monopoly on oil but partner with foreign firms on development projects.Rodriguez expects total investments in the oil and gas sector of $50 billion to $60 billion over the next four years.U.S. companies are poised to take advantage of Mexico's energy revolution. Exxon Mobil ([STOCK[NYSE:XOM]]) and ConocoPhillips ([STOCK[NYSE:COP]]) want to help extract the estimated 27 billion barrels of deep-sea crude oil in Mexico's waters.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.GILLIAN RICHCopyright 2015 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

Nov 8 (Interfax) - Nord Stream 2 is considering an alternative route for pipeline construction in the case that Denmark refuses to grant approval for the pipeline to pass through its waters, Nord Stream 2 AG CFO Paul Corcoran said at the European Autumn Gas Conference.He said that this option would take longer and be more expensive.In November, the Danish parliament will consider a law giving the government the right to forbid projects in Danish territorial waters in the case of a threat to national security. Nord Stream 2 could be affected by this law.In a conversation with journalists, Corcoran said that the alternative route for pipeline construction could go through Denmark's exclusive economic zone or in international waters, rather than territorial waters, using a more northerly route which presents several options for pipe laying. The possibility of building the pipeline via Polish territorial waters has been categorically ruled out. At the same time, he said that the company does not understand why Denmark is creating obstacles, ""but we must be prepared for alternatives.""Corcoran said that the law which may be adopted by Denmark, enabling the country to block the construction of the pipeline for security reasons, could be adopted at the second or third reading in November and come into effect from 2018. It would then be necessary to await the government's decision based on the new law.He expressed the opinion that the law would most likely be adopted.Corcoran said that under EU law the company has the right to build the pipeline. According to the current version of the law, which Denmark hopes to adopt, there will be no opportunity to appeal [the applicability of this law] and no transparency how decisions are made when applying the law.""However, should this law be adopted, we must comply with it and must be ready for alternatives,"" the Nord Stream 2 executive said. Possible delays will depend on how long engineering work for the new route takes, although ""the delay would possible be not so considerable.""Receiving approvals for construction in Europe could take up to a year he said, but this doesn't mean that there will be the same delay for construction as it is possible to work in other areas.Corcoran did not say how much more expensive or longer the pipeline could be.PIPELINES AND TRANSPORTATIONTurkStream enters Turkish waters, quarter of offshore pipeline section now laidMOSCOW. Nov 7 (Interfax) - The first line of the TurkStream Offshore Gas Pipeline entered the Turkish Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) on November 4, the project operator said in a press release.Pioneering Spirit, world's largest pipelay and construction vessel, ""marked the occasion by laying down on the seabed the section of the pipeline with Russian and Turkish flags, symbolizing the crossing of the EEZ border between the two countries,"" the company said.The border crossing also marks the completion of construction of the two offshore lines within the Russian EEZ. In total 448 kilometers of the pipeline were laid down, equally divided over the two lines. Construction of nearly 25% of the offshore pipeline section has been realized in less than six months, which is in line with the planned construction schedule. First gas is expected to flow through TurkStream in December 2019.After reaching the border of the EEZ with one line, Pioneering Spirit returned towards Anapa to commence deepwater pipelaying with the other line. Allseas' vessel Audacia had already finalized the shallow water section for both lines late July. Due to the chosen order of pipelaying it was possible to finalize the main offshore construction activities in the Russian EEZ in one campaign.Pioneering Spirit will now continue the pipelay activities with one pipeline all the way close to the Turkish landfall. The two TurkStream pipelines will come ashore in Turkey near the town of Kiyikoy, which is located approximately 100 kilometers west of Istanbul.The average speed of pipelaying by Pioneering Spirit is in excess of 4 kilometers per day, with a record set by the Allseas crew on November 1, 2017 by constructing 5.15 kilometers of TurkStream pipeline in one day. The water depth at the EEZ boundary is approximately 2,171 meters, which is close to the deepest part of the TurkStream route (2,198 meters).TurkStream consists of two offshore pipelines, both with capacity to transport up to 15.75 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year (31.5 bcm in total). The offshore section runs approximately 930 kilometers through the Black Sea, from the Russian city of Anapa to the Turkish town of Kiyikoy. Gas transported via the first pipeline is destined for the Turkish market. The other pipeline will be directed towards the Turkish-European border. The deepest point on the route of the TurkStream offshore pipeline is approximately 2,200 meters.PIPELINES AND TRANSPORTATIONRosneft planning to transship 36 mln tonnes of oil via Ust-Luga over 3 yearsMOSCOW.

Nov 3 (Interfax) - China National Petroleum Company (CNPC) is ready to provide assistance to Turkmenistan in building the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India Gas Pipeline (TAPI) and the Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline, CNPC International Turkmenistan chief Li Shuliang said at the Oil and Gas Turkmenistan-2017 conference in Ashgabat.""We are ready to help Turkmenistan build the TAPI gas pipeline and to implement THE Trans-Caspian gas pipeline project,"" he said.China is a major importer of gas from Turkmenistan, having received a total of 184 billion cubic meters since the Turkmenistan-Uzbekistan-Kazakhstan-China pipeline entered service in late 2009.In turn, Turkmengas acting head Myrat Archayev said that three lines of the Turkmenistan-Uzbekistan-Kazakhstan-China gas pipeline were currently operating, enabling Turkmenistan to export 40 bcm a year to China.Completion of a planned fourth line will boost capacity in the pipeline to 65 bcm a year. This line will be laid on a new route: Turkmenistan-Uzbekistan-Tajikistan-Kyrgyzstan-China.Archayev also pointed out that the TAPI project is being carried out at a most intensive pace.In addition, ""Turkmenistan, Turkey and the EU countries are working on the project to build the Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline, which will ensure long-term, reliable supplies of natural gas to Turkish and European markets, if of course the interested parties reach the corresponding agreements,"" Archayev said.PIPELINES AND TRANSPORTATIONItaly expecting Azerbaijani gas via TAP in 2020 - Azerbaijani Energy MinBAKU. Nov 2 (Interfax) - Italy is expecting to receive Azerbaijani gas via the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) in 2020, the Azerbaijani Energy Ministry said in a statement.Azerbaijan's Energy Minister Parviz Shakhbazov has discussed the progress of the TAP project with the Italian vice-president of Senate Linda Lanzillotta.""During the meeting, the parties discussed the current progress of the project and the project's environmental impact. The construction of the TAP pipeline is 60% complete. Lanzillotta stressed that the Italian government is providing the project with the necessary support and expressed confidence that the pipeline in Italy will be to accept Azerbaijani gas in 2020,"" the statement said.During the meeting it was also stated that the future expansion of the Southern Gas Corridor would strengthen Italy's position. The expiration of a long term contract, supplying 35 billion cubic meters (bcm) of Algerian gas to Italy in 2020, will make the TAP pipeline increasingly vital.""All these factors as well as the increasing strategic importance of the project make clear the necessity of implementing all work according to schedule,"" the Energy Ministry statement said.During the construction of the pipeline, issues arose in Italy, delaying the progress of work. These were related to environmental protection and required decisions from government agencies. The point of dispute was the transplantation of olive trees in the Apulia Region. The regional government of Apulia even filed a case with the Council of State that the approval for laying the TAP pipeline did not take the interests of the region into account. All disputed issues have now been resolved.CIS, BALTIC and international NEWSRome to continue strategic projects with Russia, including gas, despite new U.S. sanctions - ministerMOSCOW.

Because there are strategic projects, which also affect the European Union, we plan to continue these projects,"" he said on Rossiya-24 television, responding to a question as to whether the new U.S. sanctions can jeopardize the joint projects of Russia and Italy, including Eni.EniGazprom and Eni are holding talks on a future partnership to supply gas and implement joint gas projects, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich told journalists following a Russian-Italian council on economic, industrial and financial cooperation.""Cooperation in the gas sector for us is a strategically important and mutually beneficial partnership. I am convinced that our cooperation will be long-term and in no way break down. Gazprom and Eni are holding very active talks on a future partnership both in terms of gas supplies as well as implementing joint gas projects. Sanctions have slightly complicated the process, but, in any case, I am convinced that a solution will be found. I don't see any significant complications for continuing our cooperation,"" Dvorkovich said.PoseidonThe Poseidon extension of TurkStream to Europe could be built in 2023, IGI Poseidon chief executive Elio Ruggeri told journalists at a gas conference in Milan on Wednesday.He said a final investment decision on the Poseidon project was expected at the end of 2019, when Russia's Gazprom plans to finish building TurkStream, and that it would take three or four years to build it.Poseidon was designed and approved with a view to connecting the Greek and Italian gas transportation systems. There are plans to expand it to enable direct supplies of gas from the Turkish-Greek border to Italy.CIS, BALTIC and international NEWSGazprom sees gas production grow 17% in 10MGORKI. Nov 7 (Interfax) - Gazprom saw gas production increase 17.2% year-on-year in 10M 2017, Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said during a meeting with Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.""Overall, taking into account growing demand in Russia and growing demand by our foreign consumers, we are going with year-on-year production growth of 56.4 bcm of gas. This is 17.2% more than in 2016. Without a doubt this is a significant increase,"" he said.Gazprom increased gas production by 5% to 44.7 billion cubic meters in October, data from Gazprom indicates.The Russian gas giant produced 384.1 bcm in the first ten months of 2017, 56.4 bcm or 17.2% more than in the same period of 2016. Production for the past 12 months has already topped 475 bcm, compared to 419 bcm in 2016.The weather did not help Gazprom production in October, as temperatures in Russia were 1.3 degrees warmer than a year earlier.ExportsExports, however, remained steadily high. Gazprom pumped more than 17 bcm of gas to Western Europe, like a year earlier, although this year some of the gas went into underground storage rather than to customers.Gazprom saw commercial gas exports to non-FSU countries decline 6.5% to 15.9 billion cubic meters (bcm) in October 2017 from 17 billion bcm for same month in 2016, breaking a 14-month streak of uninterrupted growth.By the end of October 2017 commercial gas exports had reached last year's levels of around 550 million cubic meters of gas per day. However, Europe and Gazprom are continuing to inject gas into underground gas storage plants in the EU due to the mild weather. In contrast, during this time last year underground gas storage tanks in Europe had already been filled since October 10, which is why physical supplies were 40 million-50 million cubic meters per day higher in the last week of October compared to the same period in 2016. A portion of the physical flow went into underground gas storage tanks, whereas last year a portion of commercial exports had already been provided by underground gas storage tanks.Gazprom exported the same amount of gas to Europe in physical terms in October 2017 (slightly above 17 bcm) compared to the year before.The company exported 157.15 bcm of gas in 10M 2017, up 9.2% or by 13.2 bcm compared to last year. Exports have remained at 192 bcm for the past 12 months, following 179.3 bcm.CIS, BALTIC and international NEWSGazprom share on EU market continues to grow in 2017 - Gazprom Export CEOMILAN. Nov 8 (Interfax) - The share of Russian gas on the European Union gas market is continuing to grow in 2017, having increased to 33% in 2016 from 31% the year before.LLC Gazprom Export CEO Elena Burmistrova told Interfax in an interview that Russian gas exports are growing faster than the EU gas market.""Throughout 2017, everyone could see how Gazprom's carefully calibrated strategy was working; ramping up volumes and maximizing forex revenues. We have implemented it successfully. I presented figures today [a forecast for an increase in gas exports to Europe to 185-190 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2017 compared to 179.3 bcm delivered under Gazprom Export and Gazprom Schweiz contracts last year]. In other words, export growth is outstripping the growth of gas consumption in Europe. So we are seeing that the niche for our gas is being maintained and will remain open for a long time coming,"" she said.Commenting on speculation that Gazprom has the capability to influence prices by controlling export volumes, Burmistrova said: ""In fact, we sometimes hear that Gazprom could play the role of price-setting supplier, that is to say, lowering volumes and thus artificially inflating prices. However, we are not manipulating the market. Firstly, we consider ourselves a responsible company and secondly, we are interested in increasing our share on the market. It will grow in addition to a proportional increase in gas demand. We are seeing the development of the gas market on the whole and hope to develop the NGV fuel market and the bunkering market, especially in the Baltic States. There are several of such niches which will drive gas exports"".Buyers of Russian gas are taking advantage of the opportunity to boost gas offtake under long- and short-term contracts, and in these conditions new export auctions are not needed, Burmistrova said.Gazprom Export held its first export auction in 2015, for delivery during the 2015-2016 winter, and another in August-September 2016 for delivery between October 2016 and March this year. An auction for gas in 2017-2018 has not yet been announced.""We've effectively decided against it for this winter,"" Burmistrova said.""I'm not saying we've decided to dispense with auctions as a means of trading in the future, but right now we're having no problems selling gas. And we have enough orders from long-standing clients to supply more gas under our long-term contracts as well as more orders under short-term contracts. In other words, today we have no need for auctions as a means of stimulating higher sales,"" she said.U.S. LNGLiquefied natural gas exports from the United States to Europe would be competitive if the price of gas at America's Henry Hub is lowered at least two-thirds, Burmistrova told Interfax.""We've seen various estimates and expert opinions, but it all comes down to the same thing. Don't be surprised, but for American LNG to be competitive in Europe, it would have to cost around $1/mbtu at the Henry Hub, preferably less,"" she said. Gas at the hub currently trades at $3.1/mbtu.""But we understand perfectly well that the price won't fall so low in America. In fact, prices on the American market are tending to grow. In any event I think that to talk about it competing with Russian gas, which is incommensurably more appealing from the geographical point of view, would be premature today, even given that we are now seeing prices grow for oil, to which our contract prices are linked. Although the tendency for growth might be a temporary one, nobody knows,"" she said.""Of course, for American producers in general it would be preferable to export gas to the Asia-Pacific region, to countries like China, or to new markets such as Indonesia,"" Burmistrova said.Asked about the prospects for competing with American LNG in China, Burmistrova said the ""Chinese market is huge by definition.""""And today we keep hearing new reports from China that the energy mix needs to change, that it's time to depart from coal. Of course, economically that would be fairly hard, in places painful for China. But the trend is quite obvious, and China will move assuredly towards this. So I don't think there's any point talking about competition on a market which is virtually bottomless today,"" she said.CIS, BALTIC and international NEWSGazprom, IDRO studying possibility of cooperating on LNG, gas processing projects in IranMOSCOW.

Gas exports are expected to rise to 3.451 bcm per year. A number of building and installation works are planned as well as well drilling, major well repairs and procurement of equipment and machinery.The program will be financed with $503.81 million of Uzbeknetegaz's own funds and loans totaling $1.489 billion.NGS was involved in the project as a broker, borrower and exporter of part of the produce.In September, at the request of Uzbekneftegaz, NGS announced a tender for a general contractor to build 254 gas and 168 oil wells and the construction of production facilities at Uzneftegazdobycha fields, which is part of Uzbekneftegaz.The presidential decree clarifies that UAE-based Eriell Oilfield Service Middle East DMCC, Austria's Eriell GmbH and Enter Engineering Pte Ltd (owned by Gazprombank Group) will be the general contractors on a turnkey basis following the tender.The program to increase production of hydrocarbon feedstock for 2017-2021 was confirmed by the Uzbek President in March this year. It is expected that its implementation will enable the country to boost natural gas production to 53.5 bcm, gas condensate to 1.1 million tonnes and oil to 1.9 million tonnes. Total investment in the program has been estimated at $3.9 billion.The Natural Gas-Stream JV was established at the end last year to carry out exploration work at the Sechankul, Akdzhar and Chimbay investment blocks. In addition to Uzbekneftegaz, subsidiaries LLC Mubarekneftegaz and LLC Ustyurtgaz are also cofounders joined by foreign companies GPD and Cyprus-based Altmax holding Ltd.Uzbekistan is the third biggest producer of natural gas in among CIS countries and is a top ten gas producer on the world stage.

We also discussed what must be done if it becomes necessary to extend the deal,"" he said.Novak said that discussions and a decision on the possible extension of the OPEC+ deal would take place at a later date. ""We will not discuss how advisable extending the deal is today. Why should we do it now?"" the minister said.OPEC and non-OPEC countries are discussing various scenarios on the future fate of the deal to cut oil output, including smoothly exiting from it by gradually increasing oil production, Novak said.""The exit needs to be smooth, so as not to dump a large amount of oil on the market, which would be destabilizing. There is no concrete project so far. There are simply discussions in the framework of conceptual approaches, including, for example, the option of smoothly increasing production over the course of several months: two, three, four,"" he said.He said that the fate of the deal would be discussed at a meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC countries in Vienna in November. He did not rule out that a final decision could be made at a later date though.Novak said that Russia cut oil output by 315,000 barrels per day in October, exceeding its commitments in the deal with OPEC by 5%.The OPEC/non-OPEC deal, which entered force in January 2017, is currently set to expire at the end of March 2018. The agreement may be extended if necessary. However, oil prices have risen steadily since late October, rising above $60 per barrel in the last days of the month.OPEC expects global oil exports to increase by 6.5 million barrels per day (bpd) to 44 million bpd from 2016-2040, OPEC said in its World Oil Outlook (WOO).Global growth of oil exports will be driven by expanding pipeline exports, primarily in North America, Russia and the Caspian basin.Oil exports from Russia and the Caspian basin will grow from 6.1 million bpd in 2016 to slightly below 7.5 million bpd in 2040. Oil exports to these regions will total 900,000 bpd by 2020.Oil output by non-OPEC countries will grow 5 million barrels per day to 62 million bpd by 2022, OPEC said.Non-OPEC supply growth will be driven mostly by higher U.S. shale production, and to a lesser extent by other countries.Russia is likely to produce 11 million bpd in 2017-2018, rising to 11.2 million bpd in 2019, 11.4 million bpd in 2020 and 11.3 million bpd in 2021-2022 before falling to 11.2 million bpd in 2025 and holding at 11.1 million bpd in 2030-2040.CIS, BALTIC and international NEWSEnergy Ministry says situation with sulfur in Urals crude under controlMOSCOW.

We've been monitoring it very closely for the last three years. We are responsible for the quality of the crude being supplied to Russian refineries, and we are responsible for quality and guaranteed exports,"" Deputy Energy Minister Kirill Molodtsov told Interfax.""The situation is sustainable,"" he said.The Energy Ministry, concerned about the problem of the declining oil quality in the Transneft system in 2018, held a meeting on this issue at the end of October.A representative of one of the companies present at the meeting told Interfax that according to forecasts, sulfur content in the Druzhba pipeline, which delivers crude to European consumers, will be over 1.8%.According to information circulated to oil companies by Transneft, sulfur content could rise to 1.8% in oil shipped to Ust-Luga, to Novorossiysk - 1.58% and to Primorsk - 1.63% in 2018-2020.Quality is deteriorating because more Western Siberian low-sulfur oil is being shipped to China.Transneft planned by 2019 to have built the Nizhnevartovsk-Alexandrovka connector, which will allow high-sulfur crude to be exported eastwards. The sulfur content of crude pumped along the East Siberian - Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline will as a result increase from 0.5% to 0.6%, but still below the 1% threshold. The sulfur content of crude must not exceed 0.65%, according to agreements with Chinese partners, but it could take a year and a half to implement these measures.The Energy Ministry proposed at the meeting to supply 4 million tonnes of high sulfur crude to Belarus by rail as a possible quick solution to the problem in 2018.Russia, Iran, Azerbaijan agree to broaden oil, gas cooperation, including field explorationRussian President Vladimir Putin, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev took part in a trilateral summit Russia-Iran-Azerbaijan in Tehran on Wednesday afternoon.

But this does not mean that we should compete. This means that we should coordinate our efforts. By the way, the coordination within the OPEC framework has already yielded its positive results. But it would have been impossible, had the countries not affiliated with this cartel not joined this work,"" he said.""The same is also happening within the framework of the Organization of Gas Producing Countries. Here we are also cooperating and will further cooperate. I would like to pay attention to the fact that despite the large-scale production of these hydrocarbons in each of our countries, there is, no matter how strange this sounds, an interest to supplies of these raw materials to each other. I refer to internal logistics.

(Graphic: Business Wire)   Market Insights   Taiwan’s petrochemical industry primarily produces commodity chemicals, especially polypropylene and other plastic resins. Despite constraints on the supply of raw materials and an increased reliance on imports for certain chemicals and materials, profits and profit margins in the industry are increasing substantially. This is largely due to oversupply in the global crude oil markets, which is resulting in lower prices of crude oil (in the range of USD 50-55 bbl). As crude oil comprises almost 80% of costs for upstream petrochemical manufacturers, operating costs are falling in line with crude oil prices.   These increased profits are helping Taiwan’s petrochemical manufacturers to thrive despite the presence of many obstacles, including the cancellation of the Kuokuang petrochemical complex project in 2011, which eliminated the potential for many jobs and the opportunity for increased production throughout the industry. Additionally, new environmental regulations and protections were expected to have a negative effect on the production and revenues of petrochemical manufacturers in Taiwan. While total revenues in the industry have dropped slightly as of late, crude oil oversupply is so far allowing the industry to increase profits and remain afloat.

The global carbon dioxide market size is expected to reach USD 8.6 billion by 2025. Increasing applications of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technology, owing to rising crude oil demand and number of mature wells is anticipated to fuel the market growth over the next nine years.   Carbon dioxide is a high profile greenhouse gas. However, the excessive amount of CO2 is being dumped into the atmosphere from past few years due to the growth in industrialization.

The decline came because Orpic Company dueconsumed of approximately 900 thousand additional barrels in July. The declince is also attributed to DNO Company,which didn't export any crude oil in the same month.The Asian markets, as usual, have the biggest share of the Omani oil exports (100% of the Sultanate's production in July 2015 exported to Asia).Although China's imported rate declined by 20% in comparison with June 215, it still topped the list with 69.25% in July 2015.Japan's rate rose by 15.15% in July 2015, the highest rate of import by Japan since January 2015.Taiwan's and Thailand's imports of Omani crude oil rose by 5.78% and 2.20% respectively.Meanwhile, Singapore imports of the crude oil fell by 0.50%.The average price for American crude oil in New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) in July 2015 amounted to 51.19 USD per barrel, indicating a 8,95 USD decline compared to the trading of June 2015 .The North Sea (Brent) basket in ICE in London averaged 56.91 USD per barrel, comprising a decline by 7.21 USD compared to the trading of June 2015.The major factors that had a negative effect on the downward movement of the price movement general indicator during the month include the continuous debt crisis of Greece, the collapse indicators for the Chinese stock market and the historic agreement about Iran nuclear file. These factors led oil prices to a record low since starting 2015 trading. Moreover, the appreciation of US dollar and the three-year peak production by OPEC, in addition to the abundant supplies also contributed to the decline in oil prices. There are no indicators in the market that the prices will improve at least on the short run. World oil markets may need more subsidy and time to restore balance and recover its gains.The trading of Oman Crude Oil Future Contract at Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME Oman) declined in price in the same month, as it has been the case with other crude oils due to the above-mentioned factors. It averaged between 61.85 USD and 52.47 USD per barrel.Meanwhile, Oman oil price (September Delivery 2015) stood at USD 56.33 comprising a decline by 5.51 USD compared toAugust delivery 2015.Copyright 2015 by Emirates News Agency Distributed by UPICopyright of Arabia 2000 is the property of Arabia 2000.

In order to reduce costs quickly, rig contracts have been wound down by operators resulting in a large drop in active rigs during the first quarter of 2015.In order to improve drilling economics, operators have focused on driving down well costs, pressuring service providers to drop costs, pushing drilling rates down, and testing alternative completion methods to improve well productivity.Due to the drastic shift in development schedules for operators, fewer wells are being drilled, completed and brought online. As a result, production levels from the Eagle Ford in 2015 are likely to see a minimal increase compared to 2014 and plateau until market conditions improve.ScopeReport provides information and insight on:Key Topics Covered:1 List of Tables and List of Figures2 Key Points3 Introduction4 Geology5 Acreage6 Deals7 Anadarko8 Chesapeake9 EOG10 ConocoPhillips11 Pioneer12 Active Counties13 Well Cost14 Well Completion and Configuration15 Rig Counts16 Break-even Costs17 Permit Activity18 Estimated Ultimate Recovery19 Capital Expense Forecast20 Contracts21 Projected Rig Counts22 Crude Oil Production Forecast23 Other Operators24 AppendixCompanies MentionedFor more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/b3jdv4/eagle_ford_shale.CONTACT: Research and Markets,Laura Wood,Senior Manager.press@researchandmarkets.comFax from USA: 646-607-1907Fax from rest of the world: +353-1-481-1716Sector: Oil (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/categories.asp?cat_id=46&campaign_id=b3jdv4)((Comments on this story may be sent to info@m2.com))(C)2015 M2 COMMUNICATIONS http://www.m2.comCopyright of M2PressWIRE is the property of M2PressWIRE.

Well, now the downturn in oil prices is giving rise to a new kind of criminal, oil rustlers. Mose Buchele from member station KUT takes us to South Texas.MOSE BUCHELE: Mike Peters drives through the brush country of La Salle County touring the oil fields. As he steers his pickup, he says, let's play cop for a little while. Peters was on the San Antonio police force for more than 30 years, so he knows how to play cop.MIKE PETERS: You notice the truck that was here when we pulled out?BUCHELE: Yeah.PETERS: I don't know the truck. It's not one of ours.BUCHELE: So you're wondering what they're up to.After Peters retired, he became head of security for the drilling company Lewis Energy. The truck he was following seemed to be trying to enter oil well sites.PETERS: More than likely, he's purely legitimate. But if you don't question when you see something like that, you never catch anybody.BUCHELE: These days, he's trying to catch oil thieves. It's become a big problem. He says people are sneaking into well sites and stealing crude oil. We'll get into how that works in a minute. But first, why? Why would anyone want to steal oil when prices are so low? For some answers, let's take a detour to the nearby city of Cotulla. In a town plaza, cars line up for an outdoor food pantry. Volunteers say the need is great. Since the oil downturn, many people are out of work. Ismael Telles put it this way.ISMAEL TELLES: Gas goes up, the oil field goes up. Then the gas goes down, and then you go back to the house.BUCHELE: Telles used to work the oil fields. He's been unemployed now for a couple years. He says these days, people are getting creative to make ends meet.TELLES: Like cut grass, lawn mowers, weed eating.BUCHELE: Odd construction jobs, ranch work, maybe even stealing.MIGUEL RODRIGUEZ: It's all about the money. It's always about the green dollar.BUCHELE: That's La Salle County Sheriff Miguel Rodriguez. Since the downturn, he's investigated all sorts of oil field thefts - stolen generators, stolen truck batteries, and yes, stolen oil. He says these crimes seem to be on the rise.RODRIGUEZ: You know, you got people that they hire to work, and then for some reason, they get terminated. They get fired. And then they know the system so they know when they can go to the location where they know there's the oil, and they sell it in the black market.BUCHELE: This eerie noise is the wind hitting the side of an empty tanker truck. It was used in an alleged oil heist last fall. Now it's in a police impound lot in Cotulla. If you know how to use a truck like this, it's easy to connect to an oil storage tank. Grab some crude. The next step is laundering it. Lewis Energy's Mike Peters says one way people do that is partner with the owner of an oil well that isn't producing.PETERS: And all of a sudden, it becomes what we call a miracle well. It will all of a sudden start producing 25, 50 barrels a day where before it didn't produce anything.BUCHELE: Another way is to claim the oil as salvaged, skimmed from the wastewater that's a byproduct of oil production. So how big a problem is oil theft?PETERS: The standard answer to that, which comes out of the Energy Security Council, is that it is probably between 1 to 3 percent of all the oil produced in Texas.BUCHELE: That could be billions of dollars. That's why oil companies in Texas are lobbying for higher penalties against thieves. Some want to fund more police just to patrol the oil fields. Remember that suspicious looking at the beginning of the story, he turned out to be a hunter. But, Mike Peters says he's glad he checked just to be on the safe side.

Key manufacturers such as Halliburton/Baker Hughes, Schlumberger, which also provide oilfield services such as drilling and production, consume these chemicals in bulk amounts, internally, for their operations. Remote locations are catered through distributors.""Rising demand for COFI from the developing markets of the Middle East &amp; Africa is one of the major drivers of the this market""With the removal of sanctions on Iran, various International Oil Companies (IOCs) are willing to invest in the country which is offering around 50 oil &amp; gas projects and 18 energy &amp; power blocks worth USD 185 million by 2020. The political situations in countries such as Nigeria and Libya are expected to smoothen in the coming years that will result in ramping up crude oil production from these nations. This is expected to drive the demand for COFI products from these countries.

[ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,bizwire.c72441724,Regional Business News,"Middle East $38.1 Billion Oil Field Services Market Outlook, 2020 - Falling Crude Oil Prices are Forecasting a Gloomy Picture for OFS - Research and Markets"," Research and Markets has announced the addition of the ""Middle East Oil Field Services Market Outlook - Market Analysis by Geography, Type, Competitive Landscape, Key Company Information - Growth Trends and Forecasts (2015-2020)"" report to their offering.   Middle oil field services market is estimated to increase from $20.5 billion in 2014 to $38.1 billion by 2020.   Although, falling crude oil prices are forecasting a gloomy picture for OFS, service companies are expected to ride out the storm with long term contracts and mergers.   Oil & gas exploration and production is a complex process and each and every step requires sophisticated technology and equipment. Until the 90s, OFS firms were smaller and did straightforward tasks such as drilling vertical wells. But, over past two decades big oil & gas companies decided to outsource much of the exploration and production work which allowed the OFS firms to grow. OFS companies in turn drove the innovation in oil & gas sector by pioneering technologies like directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing.   The research published on OFS covers a variety of services such as well intervention, wireline logging, coiled tubing, completion, drilling, pressure pumping, waste management and oil country tubular goods.   Drivers   Increasing demand for energy and petro-chemicals and growing investments in oil & gas sector are some of the factors driving the OFS market.   An estimated 800 billion barrels of oil reserves are present in Middle East which makes it an attractive proposition for oil field services firms.   Challenges   Volatile oil & gas prices, environmental concerns, operational challenges and geo political situation in some regions are severely impairing the OFS market.   Key Topics Covered:   1.

Crude oil production in OPEC Member Countries reached 30.7m b/d during 2014, down 2.9 per cent from 2013, year-on-year.''The overall OPEC share to the world crude production total in 2014, it added, was at 41.8 per cent, lower than in 2013, when it was 43.3 per cent. Non-OPEC oil supply and OPEC NGLs, as well as non-conventional oil production inched to 62.3m b/d, increasing by 3.9 per cent as compared to the 2013 levels.This 50th edition of the ASB provides detailed and comprehensive time-series data on many different aspects of the global petroleum industry, including production, demand, imports and exports, as well as exploration, prices and transportation activities.The publication contains, in particular, key statistical data on oil and natural gas activities in each of OPEC's 12 Member Countries: Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. Additionally, it provides valuable industry data for various countries with detailed classifications, mainly by geographical region, and covers the major economic areas around the world.This year's ASB includes the following important highlights:World oil demand averaged at 91.3m b/d in 2014, up by 1.1 per cent year-on-year, with the largest increases taking place in China, the Middle East particularly in Saudi Arabia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, and in non-OECD Asia. The 2014 oil demand in Africa and Latin America continued its upward trend, while oil demand declined for another year in Western Europe. Total OECD oil demand fell slightly during 2014, while oil demand in OPEC Member Countries increased strongly for another year by 2.9 per cent,as compared to 2013. Distillates and gasoline account for around 55 per cent of total world oil demand and are on increasing trend, while residual fuel oil requirements declined for another year.In 2014, the majority of crude oil from OPEC Member Countries was exported to Asian and Pacific countries (13.7m b/d or 60.4 per cent). Substantial volumes of crude oil from OPEC Member Countries were also exported to Europe (3.8m b/d or 16.7 per cent) and North America (3.1m b/d or 13.9 per cent). Asian and Pacific countries were the largest importers of OPEC Member Countries petroleum products (2.7m b/d or 60.8 per cent). North America was the region in 2014 that recorded the largest yearly increase in oil exports (0.7m b/d or 11.7 percent) with the bulk of these volumes being petroleum products. OPEC Member Countries petroleum products exports in 2014 stood at 4.5m b/d, while during the same year the imports were at 1.6m b/d, up 1.4 per cent year-on-year.World proven crude oil reserves stood at 1,492.9 billion barrels at the end of 2014, 0.2 per cent higher as compared to the end of 2013. The largest non-OPEC additions originated in North America, particularly the US, as well as Asia and Pacific predominantly China and India. Proven crude oil reserves in OPEC Member Countries remained largely unchanged at the end of 2014, as compared to 2013 and reached a level of 1,206bn b. The overall OPEC percentage share of world proven crude oil reserved at the end of 2014 stood at 80.8 per cent.OPEC Member Countries remained important players in the natural gas market during 2014, with proven natural gas reserves of 95,129bn standard cubic metres. This marked a slight increase of 0.1 per cent from 2013, with a total world share of 47.3 per cent.The refinery capacity of OPEC Member Countries increased by 0.6m b/cd or 5.4 per cent during 2014 compared to 2013, with the bulk of increases originating in the Middle East. In 2014, OPEC Member Countries held 11.6 per cent of total world refinery capacity in 2014. World refinery capacity rose by 0.9m b/d in 2014. Gains inAsia Pacific, as well as North and Latin America have been partly offset by losses in Western Europe.

[ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,bizwire.c68020156,Regional Business News,Texas Sales Begin for OriginClear’s Crude Oil Sweetening Liquid," OriginClear Inc. (OTC/QB: OOIL), a leading provider of water treatment solutions, today announced that Cobalt Aqua Control LLC (Cobalt) recently shipped its first commercial sale of 15 barrels of an injectable crude oil sweetening liquid, produced with OriginClear technology, to an oil operator in South Texas.  This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160415005190/en/ Cobalt operating their H2S-N system at a customer site in Texas. (Photo: Business Wire)   Cobalt is a developer of oil and gas technology and remediation solutions based in Houston, TX. OriginClear licensed its Advanced Oxidation (EWS:AOx™) technology to Cobalt, and, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, has a significant membership interest in Cobalt. Cobalt’s process produces a liquid that can significantly improve oil recovery, reduce corrosive gas in the crude stream, and increase overall ROI for operators.   Known as H2S-Neutralizer™ (H2S-N™), this injectable liquid has demonstrated a dramatic improvement in oil recovery ratios, as evidenced by a stable increase in well-head pressure. In addition, H2S-N has been shown to significantly reduce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) concentration in the crude stream.   “In the first field trial we did with H2S-N, we were able to increase wellhead pressure in a gas well from an unstable 20 psi to an average 40 psi for a six-month period,” said William Germano Jr., Co-founder and Manager of Cobalt Aqua Control. “Working with OriginClear will help oil and gas operators get more value out of their production, with minimal environmental impact.”   In addition to wellhead pressure testing, other tests were performed with crude oil contaminated with H2S, or hydrogen sulfide, a highly corrosive gas that helps cause crude oil to become “sour” and lose value in the market. In field tests, hydrogen sulfide was measured from a 200 ppm concentration down to Below Readable Value (see pp. 5 and 6 of the lab report).   “The market imposes a penalty for sour crude of about 13 billion US dollars annually,” said Jean-Louis “JL” Kindler, President of OriginClear Technologies. “With oil prices still very low, producers are eager for any solution to the problem. Cobalt has an innovative approach of selling liquid, which generates a recurring revenue stream. We are delighted to be partners in this venture!”   Reducing hydrogen sulfide in crude oil can not only improve the value of crude by 8 to 10%, but also worker safety and logistics, because containers and pipelines require frequent maintenance when used with crude oil contaminated with as little as 5ppm of H2S.   OriginClear first announced in November of 2015 that its proprietary electro-oxidation technology can effectively remove 96 percent of bacteria and 97 percent of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from produced water, without chemicals. Results were reported after lab and field testing on produced water from the Eagle Ford shale, and further validated in the recent Cobalt tests.   Cobalt Aqua Control is now ramping up to commercial production and is taking orders. Interested operators and service providers are invited to email Mr. Germano at bill@cobaltaquacontrol.com, or to telephone him at (832) 630-0393 for an immediate quote.   According to petroleum.co.uk, “Hydrogen sulfide is famous for its 'rotten egg' smell… Hydrogen sulfide is so much of a risk that sour crude has to be stabilized via removal of hydrogen sulfide before it can be transported by oil tankers…   “Sour crude oil will have greater than 0.5% sulfur and some of this will be in the form of hydrogen sulfide… It is more common in the Gulf of Mexico, Mexico, South America, and Canada. Crude produced by OPEC Member Nations also tends to be relatively sour.”   Follow us on Twitter  Like us on Facebook  Signup for our Newsletter  About OriginClear, Inc.

The technological advancement pertaining to water management in the oil &amp; gas sector with an aim to not only enhance productivity but also as ensure environment protection is expected to have a positive impact on the market. Depleting reserves of crude oil in major OPEC countries including Saudi Arabia and Indonesia owing to rising capital costs in exploration &amp; production (E&amp;P) is expected to force oil companies to invest in alternate sources including tight oil, coalbed methane (CBM) and gas hydrates. This trend is projected to promote the usage of produced water treatment in E&amp;P activities of alternative sources including shale gas and tight oil over the forecast period.Offshore application is projected to account for 28.9% of total industry share by 2024. Numerous companies are focusing on expanding their market share by focusing on offshore applications. For instance, Siemens AG offers Combosep, a primary treatment system for offshore applications. This system comprises flotation units for removal of total suspended solids and oil droplets.Further key findings from the report suggest:Natural gas is projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.2% from 2016 to 2024. In July 2016, the government of Saudi Arabia announced Vision 2030 with an aim to increase gas production to 17.8 billion cubic feet by 2030 from 12 billion cubic feet per day in 2015. The abovementioned plan is expected to play a key role increasing the use of produced water treatment services over the projected period.Primary separation technology was valued at USD 1.62 billion in 2015 and is projected to have a high market potential in hydraulic fracturing in light of increasing importance of separation equipment in hydrocyclone and corrugated plate separators.Europe generated a revenue of USD 1.12 billion in 2015 and is expected to witness significant gains in light of increasing E&amp;P spending for natural gas in the Barents Sea, (Norway) and Sakhalin fields (Russia).The industry is anticipated to witness significant growth in light of significant investments by OMCs', which will open new opportunities for growth over the forecast period. In July 2016, a research partnership between the USGS, ONGC, and the JAMSTEC announced the discovery of vast reserves of natural gas hydrates in the Indian Ocean. This trend is expected to open new industry avenues for produced water treatment services over the next eight years.Key service providers operating in the market include Haliburton, GE, Siemens, Weatherford, Veolia, and Baker Hughes. The majority of service providers are located in North America and Europe in light of easy access to consumables and calibration equipment in the vicinity. Over the past few years, the companies including Weatherford and GE have been establishing strategic business units in developing countries including China and India providing the solutions to upstream oil &amp; gas sector.

Crude futures rose to the highest level since November 2014, closing at $72.76 a barrel on Wednesday. That came after oil production was flat while inventories fell.Energy has become a leading sector, now No. 8 out of 33 sectors, after starting the year at No. 25. Exploration and production industry groups in particular have performed well, and that's the focus.With any commodity ETF, these funds' fortunes depend much on the course of crude prices. Commodity bull and bear markets historically run longer than the cycles in the stock market, but opportunities do emerge in the shorter term.While oil made new highs during the week, the five energy ETFs have not. That gives investors time to study each ETF before it reaches a proper entry point. For all five, the correct buy point is the same: The previous high made in May plus 10 cents.Here's a summary of the five ETFs: SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP)  owns more than 70 stocks in exploration & production (nearly 81% of the portfolio), refining & marketing companies (13%) and integrated operations (5%).The fund is equal weighted, meaning that all holdings have the same allocation each time the portfolio is rebalanced. Vanguard Energy (VDE)  holds 143 stocks in the energy spectrum, from exploration to gas stations. But the $5.1 billion fund is heavily concentrated on the largest 10 holdings, which account for 63% of the fund's weighting.Some 38% of the portfolio is in integrated oil companies, a group that includes industry giants such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX). Fidelity MSCI Energy (FENY)  is similar to the Vanguard fund in that it is heavily weighted on its largest holdings. The top 10 account for 63% of the total weighting. That leaves only a small influence in the rest of the 135 holdings in the ETF.Nearly 83% of the $649.5 million fund is invested in big-cap companies.The iShares U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (IEO) ETF has more of a focus on the search and extraction part of the oil business. With 67 holdings, the ETF has put 73% of funds in exploration and production companies. More than 23% of the portfolio is in refinery and marketing.The $514.7 million ETF is the only one among the five that does not own heavyweights Exxon Mobil and Chevron.First Trust Energy AlphaDEX (FXN), an ETF that was discussed in last week's column, holds a portfolio of nearly 50 stocks in oilfield services, refinery, production, drilling and related companies.The other four ETFs are predominantly big-cap funds. But a median market cap of $11.9 million gives the First Trust Energy portfolio a smaller average size. The $396 million fund uses a selection methodology that grades stocks on three-, six- and 12-month price performance, one-year sales growth, certain valuation factors, and other items.GRAPH: Ishares Us Oil&Gas Explr (IEO)By JUAN CARLOS ARANCIBIACopyright of Investors Business Daily is the property of Investor's Business Daily and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

[ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",1280,94511079,Regional Business News,Crude-By-Rail Soars On Shale Oil Boom.,"ISSUES & INSIGHTSBRAIN TRUSTPoliticsRail is flexible, speedy; upgrades, inspections can make it even saferSpurred by rapid growth in crude oil shipments in the last few years, America's freight railroads are gaining a new lease on life.Small amounts of domestic crude have always been transported by rail, but since the recent shale oil boom, the increase in shipments has been enormous. Last year, about 400,000 carloads of crude oil traveled by rail, up from only 9,500 carloads in 2008, according to the Association of American Railroads.At about 714 barrels of crude oil per railcar, that's more than 782,000 barrels of America's crude oil transported every day last year by rail.To grasp the revolutionary change in the logistics of crude-oil transit, consider that more than 71 million barrels of crude oil were shipped by rail in just the last quarter of 2013. That's 52% more oil than trains hauled during all of 2011, and more than 10 times the volume of oil shipped in 2008.Oil companies are increasingly leasing trains to bring the crude from remote areas where it's being produced to the markets where it's needed. But several derailments involving oil-tank cars in the United States and Canada over the past year have raised questions about whether rail shipments of oil are safe.Don't Derail Oil By RailConsidering the thousands of oil shipments by rail, the accident rate is vanishingly small. Nonetheless, there are calls in Congress for stringent government safety standards on new oil tank cars and new requirements that the tens of thousands of older tank cars now in service either be retrofitted or phased out.A more measured, less politically strident response would achieve better results. The question isn't whether to allow continued rail shipment of crude oil with existing tank cars, but how to do it more safely.There are important advantages to shipping crude by rail, and they illustrate why we are not going to take crude oil off the rail system anytime soon.Don't believe all the hype you hear about freight railroads. First, they are remarkably efficient. A single dedicated large-unit train typically carries 85,000 barrels of crude from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota to terminals or refineries on the Gulf Coast, or locations on either coast, and can be loaded or unloaded in 24 hours.Second, rail transport is significantly cheaper than truck and more flexible than pipelines to move crude long distances. Currently more than 10% of the nation's total domestic oil production is shipped by rail, up from only 3.6% in 2012.Nationwide FlexibilityUnlike pipelines, rail shipments can be quickly diverted to different locations in response to market needs. Today refiners can access nearly any crude oil produced in the United States by rail, regardless of its location.What's more, rail facilities can almost always be built or expanded more quickly than other methods of shipping oil. In 2012 alone, U.S. railroads invested a record $25.5 billion to upgrade and maintain our world-class freight rail infrastructure. And billions more were spent last year to pay for improvements to America's rail network.Yet even as railroads have invested billions to maintain, improve and expand the country's rail system, they face mandates by the Obama administration that might hamper safety instead of bringing about improvements.The railroad industry has learned useful lessons from the recent accidents, keeping in mind that any change in the nation's energy situation poses safety challenges that must be faced, resolved and overcome.Replacing and resurfacing tracks, combined with safer, improved oil tank cars and locomotives, is a good way to make transporting crude by rail as safe as possible. Railroad companies are investing heavily in both.There also needs to be a renewed focus on inspections and some consideration to slowing down trains carrying oil or rerouting them from heavily populated areas and other sensitive areas.These approaches would effectively enhance the safety of crude oil shipments, without heavy-handed regulation that can become an impediment to improvement and that would damage the very rail system that's being revitalized by the private sector.The Great American Energy Boom is the most important economic event in at least a generation, and America's rail system is playing an increasingly large role in that boom. A sensible approach would be to enact reforms that don't strangle or impede the rail sector that is supporting the fastest-growing sector of the economy — oil and gas development.• Perry is a professor of economics at the Flint campus of the University of Michigan and a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.MARK PERRYCopyright 2014 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

This week we're going to take a look at sourcing activity for Valves by users of the ThomasNet.com platform. Our data shows that over the past 12 weeks, sourcing activity for this category is up 23% over its historical average.Our firmographic buyer data shows that three of the top industries driving this sourcing trend on our platform are oil & gas, industrial equipment manufacturing, and aerospace & defense.The industrial valve market is expected to grow from $70 billion this year to over $85 billion by 2023, with the oil & gas industry fueling much of that growth. According to the US Energy Information Administration, US oil production is on track to make us the world's largest oil producer by 2019. This is based on an expectation that output at major US shale oil basins will continue to rise.However, a huge challenge facing the industry is the lack of infrastructure - primarily pipelines. This is hampering the ability to transport oil from the shale fields to refineries. In fact, at America's seven largest shale basins, there are over 8 thousand drilled but uncompleted wells as of this past August. Many of these wells sit untapped due to the fact that existing pipelines are running near or at capacity, in addition to a rail and trucking shortage. As the industry moves forward in building out the infrastructure and pipelines required to relieve this bottleneck, we expect the demand for critical components such as Valves to remain strong.In addition to the general category of Valves, our data also shows that sourcing activity is up 15% or more, month over month, in the categories of Relief Valves and Check Valves.Moving on from Valves, here's a look at the top ten industrial product and service categories being sourced on the ThomasNet.com platform over the past four weeks:To get this weekly Thomas Index Report - as well as daily news and information for industry - sign up for our Thomas Industry Update newsletter at ThomasNet.com/updates.Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next week.By Shawn FitzgeraldCopyright of ThomasNet News is the property of Thomas Publishing Company LLC and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

Based on type, the oil soluble segment is estimated to lead the demulsifier market during the forecast period. The high share of the oil soluble segment, in terms of value, can be attributed to the increasing demand for this type of demulsifier in emulsion breaking.On the basis of application, the demulsifier market has been segmented into crude oil, petro refineries, lubricant manufacturing, oil based power plants, sludge oil treatment, and others (dyes &amp; pigments, cotton seed oil, pharmaceutical, and pesticides). The crude oil application segment is projected to grow at the highest CAGR, due to the increasing demand for oil and related derivatives, which results in high production of crude oil globally. The global production of crude oil increasing, as most countries are focusing on extracting more from existing as well as new and unconventional reserves. The crude oil segment accounted for the largest share of the demulsifier market in 2016.The demulsifier market has been studied for the Middle East, North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Africa, and South America. The demulsifier market in North America is projected to grow at the highest rate from 2017 to 2022. Crude oil is a major application of demulsifier in the region, as majority of the crude oil produced in the region is from offshore oilfields, shale formations &amp; tight oil, and oil sands. Crude oil production from offshore production and oil sands results in higher consumption of demulsifiers as compared to the onshore production. This is likely to lead to a high demand for demulsifiers in the region.Key Topics Covered:1 Introduction2 Research Methodology3 Executive Summary4 Premium Insights5 Market Overview6 Demulsifier Market, By Type7 Demulsifier Market, By Formulation8 Demulsifier Market, By Application9 Demulsifier Market, By Region10 Competitive Landscape11 Company ProfilesFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/7lt3kt/demulsifierMedia Contact:Laura Wood, Senior Manager press@researchandmarkets.comFor E.S.T Office Hours Call +1-917-300-0470 For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call +1-800-526-8630 For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900 U.S. Fax: 646-607-1907 Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/demulsifier-market-2017-2022---focus-on-crude-oil-petro-refineries-lubricant-manufacturing-oil-based-power-plants-sludge-oil-treatment-300524385.htmlSOURCE Research and Markets Source: PR Newswire US, 09/22/2017Item: 201709221200PR.NEWS.USPR.IO87881"

The fund was listed on BATS Global Markets on June 1, 2017.The Oil Hedged MLP Index is a rules-based index seeking to provide exposure to the 20 highest-yielding MLPs that are involved in oil and gas services, while seeking to reduce crude oil correlation. The 20 index components are selected based on 12-month dividend yield forecasts and equally weighted within the index. To reduce crude oil correlation, the index tracks short positions in near-term crude oil futures contracts. The short oil position ranges from 40% to 100% of the value of the MLPs in the index based on proprietary correlation measures.ETP Ventures was founded by energy industry veteran Michael Ellison and financial services entrepreneur Joseph McDonald, who recognized the problem of MLP value losses in periods of falling crude oil prices.""The MLP investment product space, which currently accounts for $64 billion in assets and 75 products, saw their assets cut nearly in half by sharp declines in crude oil prices twice in the last eight years,"" said Mr. McDonald. ""The severe problem of high correlation between MLPs and crude oil has gone unanswered until now. Our solution seeks to eliminate the daily price relationship between oil and MLPs, thereby allowing pure exposure to the highly favorable dividend income and earnings growth of MLPs,"" he added.Price and return data for OILMLPTR are independently calculated by Solactive AG, and published by ETP Ventures.About Amplify ETFs Amplify believes the ETF structure empowers investors through efficiency, transparency and flexibility.

It discusses the effects on upstream projects, refining, petrochemicals, polymers, specialty chemicals, biofuels, end-user applications, and gross domestic product of select countries. It provides a list of the top 10 things chemical companies should know, and examines how select companies have been and will be affected.With government structural reforms expected in the short term, net oil importers China, India, and South Africa will be able to boost domestic production and consumption because of lower oil prices. This will help drive their competitiveness in the global market as well.Japan's domestic consumption is expected to be steady, with an expected increase in exports as overseas economies improve.Specialty chemicals catering to the automotive and construction industries are expected to gain due to lower oil prices.Renewable energy opportunities will continue to flourish in Europe and North America because this space is driven more by policies and subsidies than shifts in crude oil prices alone. For instance, solar panels are becoming a significant and cheaper source of electricity in some regions of the United States because of tax credits.With oil production driving the resurgence in the US economy in the past few years, sustained low prices even in the short term are expected to negatively affect exploration and production (E&P). Domestic consumption, however, will increase as consumer spending power improves, driving transportation and residential usage.Key Topics Covered:1. Executive Summary2. Crude Oil3. Upstream4.

The New ETNs are designed to provide investors with exposure to the performance of the S&P GSCI®CrudeOilTotal Return Index (“the Index”). The Index is a sub-index of the S&P GSCI® Commodity Index and reflects the returns that are potentially available through an unleveraged investment in the West Texas Intermediate (WTI)crudeoilfutures contract.   [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER],,bizwire.c72414080,Regional Business News,Barclays launches iPath® Series B S&P GSCI® Crude Oil ETN," Barclays Bank PLC (“Barclays”) announced today the launch of the iPath® Series B S&P GSCI® Crude Oil ETNs (“New ETNs”) on the NYSE Arca exchange under the ticker symbol OILB. The New ETNs are designed to provide investors with exposure to the performance of the S&P GSCI® Crude Oil Total Return Index (“the Index”). The Index is a sub-index of the S&P GSCI® Commodity Index and reflects the returns that are potentially available through an unleveraged investment in the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures contract.   The New ETNs feature an investor fee calculated and subtracted from the closing indicative value of the ETNs on a daily basis at a rate of 0.45% per annum. The New ETNs will also be redeemable at the sole discretion of Barclays on any trading day on or after their inception until maturity.   Barclays has also announced that effective after the close of trading November 18, 2016 it will suspend, until further notice, any further sales from inventory and any further issuances of iPath® S&P GSCI® Crude Oil Total Return Index ETNs (“Old ETNs” and, together with the New ETNs, the “ETNs”), which are listed on the NYSE Arca exchange under the ticker symbol OIL. Additionally, for a limited period of time, Barclays will waive the minimum early redemption size of 50,000 Old ETNs with respect to the valuation date occurring on each Wednesday (or, if such calendar day is not a trading day, the trading day immediately thereafter). Please refer to the associated press release for more details on these actions taken with respect to the Old ETNs.   Holders of the Old ETNs that wish to sell their Old ETNs and/or purchase New ETNs may take any of the following actions:   1) Sell Old ETNs and/or purchase New ETNs on the secondary market at the prevailing trading price on the exchange;   2) Put Old ETNs to Barclays (including with respect to the valuation date occurring on each Wednesday with reduced minimum early redemption sizes) and simultaneously purchase New ETNs from Barclays in an amount having an equal dollar value, with each transaction having the same valuation date and settlement date (a “Net Settlement”). In this case, upon redemption of its Old ETNs, the holder would receive a number of New ETNs equal to the aggregate daily redemption value of the redeemed Old ETNs, rounded to the nearest full New ETN, with a residual cash payment for any “partial” remaining ETNs. Holders who wish to effect a Net Settlement must instruct their broker or other person through whom they hold their Old ETNs in accordance with the procedures set forth in the section “Specific Terms of the ETNs—Early Redemption Procedures” in the prospectus relating to the Old ETNs. Holders may also contact Barclays at etndesk@barclays.com or 1-212-528-7790 to obtain further information regarding the procedures for Net Settlement.  3) Put Old ETNs to Barclays under the early redemption option without simultaneously purchasing New ETNs or purchase New ETNs from Barclays without simultaneously redeeming Old ETNs, in each case for the applicable cash value.   Any redemption of Old ETNs or sale of New ETNs is subject to the conditions described in the prospectus for the relevant series of ETNs and will be valued using the applicable daily redemption value or closing indicative value on the valuation date for the transaction, with no additional purchase or redemption fees, in each case in accordance with the prospectus for the relevant series of ETNs. Holders are not required to take any of the actions set forth above and may choose to continue to hold their ETNs at any time. Anyone considering investing in the ETNs or continuing to hold the ETNs should consider the risks described in the prospectus for the relevant series of ETNs when making an investment decision and consult with their broker or financial adviser to evaluate their investment in the ETNs.   The ETNs are riskier than ordinary unsecured debt securities and have no principal protection. The ETNs are unsecured debt obligations of the issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of or guaranteed by any third party. An investment in the ETNs involves significant risks, including possible loss of principal, and may not be suitable for all investors. For more information on risks associated with the ETNs, please see ""Selected Risk Considerations"" below and the risk factors included in the relevant prospectus.  The prospectus relating to the relevant series of ETNs can be found on EDGAR, the SEC website, at: www.sec.gov. The prospectus is also available on the product website at www.iPathETN.com.   For further information, please instruct your broker/advisor/custodian to email us at etndesk@barclays.com or alternatively, your broker/custodian can call us at: 1-212-528-7990.   Selected Risk Considerations   An investment in the iPath ETNs described herein involves risks. Selected risks are summarized here, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks described under “Risk Factors” in the applicable prospectus supplement and pricing supplement.   You May Lose Some or All of Your Principal: The ETNs are exposed to any decrease in the level of the underlying index between the inception date and the applicable valuation date. Additionally, if the level of the underlying index is insufficient to offset the negative effect of the investor fee and other applicable costs, you will lose some or all of your investment at maturity or upon redemption, even if the value of such index has increased. Because the ETNs are subject to an investor fee and any other applicable costs, the return on the ETNs will always be lower than the total return on a direct investment in the index components. The ETNs are riskier than ordinary unsecured debt securities and have no principal protection.  Issuer Redemption: Barclays Bank PLC will have the right to redeem or call the ETNs (in whole but not in part) at its sole discretion and without your consent on any trading day on or after the inception date until and including maturity.   The ETNs offer exposure to futures contracts and not direct exposure to physical commodities: The ETNs offer investors exposure to the price of New York Mercantile Exchange-traded West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures contracts and not to the spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil. The price of a commodity futures contract reflects the expected value of the commodity upon delivery in the future, whereas the spot price of a commodity reflects the immediate delivery value of the commodity. A variety of factors can lead to a disparity between the expected future price of a commodity and the spot price at a given point in time, such as the cost of storing the commodity for the term of the futures contract, interest charges to finance the purchase of the commodity and expectations concerning supply and demand for the commodity. The price movement of a futures contract is typically correlated with the movements of the spot price of the reference commodity, but the correlation is generally imperfect and price moves in the spot market may not be reflected in the futures market (and vice versa). Accordingly, the ETNs may underperform a similar investment that reflects the return on the physical commodity.   Credit of Barclays Bank PLC: The ETNs are unsecured debt obligations of the issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of or guaranteed by any third party. Any payment to be made on the ETNs, including any payment at maturity or upon redemption, depends on the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is subject to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-In Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC will affect the market value, if any, of the ETNs prior to maturity or redemption. In addition, in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations of become subject to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-In Power (or any other resolution measure) by the relevant U.K. resolution authority, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the ETNs.   Market and Volatility Risk: The prices of physical commodities, including the commodities underlying the index components, can fluctuate widely due to supply and demand disruptions in major producing or consuming regions. Additionally, the market value of the ETNs may be influenced by many unpredictable factors including changes in supply and demand relationships (including as a result of redemptions of the ETNs and, in the case of the New ETNs, sales from inventory and issuances of New ETNs), governmental policies and economic events.   A Trading Market for the ETNs May Not Develop: Although the ETNs are listed on NYSE Arca, a trading market for the ETNs may not develop and the liquidity of the ETNs may be limited, as we are not required to maintain any listing of the ETNs.   No Interest Payments from the ETNs: You will not receive any interest payments on the ETNs.   Restrictions on the Minimum Number of ETNs and Date Restrictions for Redemptions: Except in the circumstances described above, you must redeem at least 50,000 ETNs of the same issue at one time in order to exercise your right to redeem your ETNs on any redemption date. You may only redeem your ETNs on a redemption date if we receive a notice of redemption from you by certain dates and times as set forth in the pricing supplement.   Uncertain Tax Treatment: Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the ETNs are uncertain. You should consult your own tax advisor about your own tax situation.   Barclays Bank PLC has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus and other documents Barclays Bank PLC has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the issuer and this offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting www.iPathETN.com or EDGAR on the SEC website at www.sec.gov . Alternatively, Barclays Bank PLC will arrange for Barclays Capital Inc. to send you the prospectus if you request it by calling 212-528-7990, or you may request a copy from any other dealer participating in the offering.   The ETNs may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account. There are restrictions on the minimum number of ETNs you may redeem directly with the issuer as specified in the applicable prospectus. Commissions may apply and there are tax consequences in the event of sale, redemption or maturity of ETNs. Sales in the secondary market may result in significant losses.

OILK is the onlycrudeoilETF that is not a commodities partnership and therefore does not deliver K-1 tax forms to shareholders.   [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",,bizwire.c71431091,Regional Business News,ProShares Launches Only U.S. Crude Oil ETF With No K-1," ProShares, a premier provider of ETFs, today announced the launch of ProShares K-1 Free Crude Oil Strategy ETF (Bats: OILK). OILK is the only crude oil ETF that is not a commodities partnership and therefore does not deliver K-1 tax forms to shareholders.   “Many investors want to invest in crude oil with the convenience of an ETF, but all other crude oil ETFs involve complicated tax reporting,” said Michael L. Sapir, co-founder and CEO of ProShares Advisors, LLC, the advisor to ProShares. “OILK is the only U.S. ETF that lets investors get crude oil exposure but skip the K-1 tax form.”   OILK is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, unlike other crude oil ETFs, which are commodities partnerships. Like other 1940 Act funds, OILK will provide shareholder tax reporting information on 1099 forms, not the K-1 form issued by partnerships.   Potential Outperformance   OILK seeks to provide total return by providing exposure to the West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) crude oil futures market in an actively managed ETF. The fund’s strategy seeks to outperform certain index-based strategies by actively managing the rolling of crude oil futures contracts. Rolling means selling a futures contract as it nears its expiration date and replacing it with a new one that has a later expiration date. Managing the rolling of futures contracts can potentially mitigate losses from contango (when new contracts are more expensive than expiring ones) and help the fund benefit from backwardation (when new contracts are less expensive than expiring ones).   About ProShares   ProShares helps investors to go beyond the limitations of conventional investing and face today's market challenges. ProShares strives to help investors build better portfolios by providing access to a wide variety of investment exposures and strategies delivered with the liquidity, transparency and cost effectiveness of ETFs. Our wide array of ETFs can help you reduce volatility, manage risk and enhance returns.   Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. ProShares ETFs are generally non-diversified and each entails certain risks, including risks associated with the use of derivatives (swap agreements, futures contracts and similar instruments), leverage and market price variance, all of which can increase volatility and decrease performance. Investing in the energy industry is prone to significant volatility resulting from dramatic changes in commodities prices. There are additional risks related to large institutional purchases or sales, changes in exchange rates, government regulation, world events, economic and political conditions in the countries where energy companies are located or do business, and risks for environmental damage claims. Certain derivative instruments will subject the fund to counterparty risk and credit risk, which could result in significant losses for the fund. Please see their summary and full prospectuses for a more complete description of risks. There is no guarantee any ProShares ETF will achieve its investment objective  This ETF seeks to provide total return through actively managed exposure to the West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) crude oil futures markets. The fund does not invest in nor seek exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of physical crude oil. The fund’s strategy seeks to outperform certain index-based strategies by actively managing the rolling of WTI crude oil futures contracts to (a) mitigate the negative impact of contango, or (b) benefit from the backwardation present in the WTI crude oil futures markets, but there can be no guarantee that it will be successful in doing so. The fund seeks to remain fully exposed to WTI crude oil futures, even during adverse market conditions. As such, the fund should be expected to decrease in value when WTI crude oil futures markets deteriorate. During adverse conditions, the fund seeks to lose less than index-based strategies that formulaically roll contracts. However, there can be no assurance that the fund will outperform index-based or other actively managed strategies that invest in WTI crude oil futures markets. Active management may also increase transaction costs. Investors should actively manage and monitor their investments. This ETF may not be suitable for all investors.   Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of ProShares before investing. This and other information can be found in their summary and full prospectuses .

Saudi Arabia remained country's top supplier, with its shipments jumping 25.5 percent to 957,000 bpd, followed byAngola with 824,000 bpd, up 12.7 percent. Oman became third, with exports from the country surging 108.8 percent (I confirm this figure) to 808,000 bpd.

U.S. crude rallied 3.1% to $48.22 a barrel, the highest since July 7.

Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) ticked 1% higher.Hopes for an output deal come despite Saudi Arabia boosting production and exports, which in June climbed to the highest level in three months. June output rose to 10.55 million barrels a day from 10.27 million in May, according to Saudi data. OPEC said last week Saudi output in July reached a record 10.67 million barrels.Meanwhile, Jones Energy (JONE) is joining Continental Resources (CLR) and other shale exploration and production companies in Oklahoma's Stack and Scoop play. On Thursday, Jones said it will acquire 18,000 net acres in Oklahoma for $136.5 million.""This transformative transaction gives Jones Energy a scalable footprint in one of the most coveted resource plays in the U.S.,"" said Chief Executive Jonny Jones in a release. ""We identified this area as a primary target for Jones over a year ago and are thrilled to be acquiring assets in the heart of the STACK/SCOOP play.""IBD'S TAKE: U.S. shale exploration and production companies are in buy range as oil prices rise back above $40 per barrel. Oil majors aren't doing as well. The leader among explorer-producers is Callon Petroleum, which has a 99 composite rating from IBD, meaning it outperforms 99% of all other stocks.Shale bellweather Continental is also focused on the Oklahoma plays. In Q2, the company said Stack production jumped 31% to 14,610 barrels of oil per day vs. Q1.Companies are rushing to take advantage of the new plays as production in North Dakota's Bakken falls off. On Thursday, Continental Resources said it has reached a deal to sell noncore assets in North Dakota and Montana for $222 million.The new Stack play has ""superior geology"" vs. other plays Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg said in a prior interview with IBD. It is also more oil weighted than other plays, making it more economical to drill as oil fetches a higher price than natural gas. He said the play's full potential is just now being explored.Deutsche Bank raised its price target on Continental earlier this month over ""higher confidence surrounding Continental's Stack play.""Continental shares were up 2.5% Thursday, while Jones sank nearly 23% as it also announced a secondary offering of 14 million shares.Brent oil hit $50 a barrel while interest in Oklahoma's Stack and Scoop play heats up.

Application of LPG in the industrial sector is also increasing, owing to growing use of LPG as a feedstock in petrochemical plants in the country. Moreover, rising demand from transport segment and increasing consumption of LPG to produce various chemical components such as propylene, ethylene, butadiene, etc., is further anticipated to boost demand for LPG in the country in the coming years. Furthermore, increasing prices of naptha, rising LPG imports and expanding distribution network are anticipated to fuel consumption of LPG in India during FY17-FY26.
