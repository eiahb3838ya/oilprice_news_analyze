2018-12-31,"In the decades preceding the arrival of U.S. shale oil, the oil market had only one stabilizing force, namely OPEC. The reason the oil market was structured as such was due to the nature of conventional oil production, most non-OPEC oil production prior to U.S. shale oil fell in one of two categories: major offshore projects that took 5 to 7 years to build (North Sea, Gulf of Mexico … etc.) or mature conventional onshore fields (U.S. conventional fields, Russian Siberian fields … etc.); both of these conventional oil supply sources were either non-responsive, or only slowly reactive, to changes in the oil price, major offshore oil projects tended to come online regardless of the oil price environment, while conventional onshore oil production with shallow decline rates (sub-10 percent) meant that even a slowdown in drilling would not impact total production in any meaningful way for an extended period of time.The aforementioned state of affairs meant that it was up to OPEC to adjust production to balance the market in case of abrupt supply or demand changes, OPEC had (and still has) the flexibility to withdraw millions of barrels from the market within a month or two if such a need arose (OPEC withdrawing 4m barrels from the market following the financial crisis in 2008/2009 is a case in point).The arrival of U.S. shale oil in size to the scene in 2014 has upended the OPEC/non-OPEC balancing act, by introducing a medium-term oil supply balancing mechanism that in the long run will prove supportive to the oil market, and especially so to non-shale oil producers.Analysis Non-OPEC production trends following the oil crash in 2014 are instrumental in demonstrating the points discussed in the introduction. Following the oil crash of late 2014, U.S. crude production (lower 48 ex-GOM) declined by one million barrels (EIA data) between December 2014 and December 2016:(Click to enlarge)Shale oil which represented 70 percent of U.S. crude production on December 2014 (5.23M barrels) declined by 690K barrels, representing a 13 percent decline during that same time frame. U.S. shale oil production declined by 5.2 percent in the first year to 4.97M barrels (December 2015), and then declined by an additional 8.6 percent in the following year to 4.54M (December 2016).  Related: Venezuela: A Real Threat To Guyana's Oil BoomThe decline in U.S. shale oil stands in contrast to oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, which increased by 18 percent from 1.45M to 1.72M barrels during the same period due to the long-lead nature of the offshore production:(Click to enlarge)The same applies to non-OPEC production ex-U.S., with production remaining flat between Dec 2014 and Dec 2016 at around 43.5M barrels:(Click to enlarge)Please note the production swoon in May 2016 to 42.5M was mainly due to unplanned outages in Canada due to forest fires, and is not related to oil prices.As can be seen, both GOM and Non-OPEC (ex-U.S.) crude production were non-responsive to changes in oil prices. This is not to say these basins won’t respond to low oil prices - eventually, they will - but with a lag that could take between 3 and 5 years. We should see the impact of these declines by 2020 at the latest.U.S. shale oil dynamics It is clear that U.S. shale oil production is the most responsive free market oil to changes in oil prices. As U.S. shale oil production comes to represent a bigger piece of the pie in the global oil supply picture, its elastic characteristics will increasingly have a major impact on the global oil market. But before going into that let's take a closer look at the numbers (EIA data).     In December 2014, U.S. shale oil production stood at 5.23M barrels, with a total monthly legacy decline rate of 300K barrels per month. The legacy decline rate is what U.S. shale producers must replace every month to keep production flat. Net U.S. shale oil production growth that month stood at 114K barrels, to achieve that growth 414K barrels were brought online, 72 percent of which went to compensate for legacy declines. Today U.S. shale oil production stands at 8.03M barrels, with a total monthly decline rate of 530K barrels. U.S. shale producers increased production by 114K barrels in December 2018; to achieve this, new production came in at 644K barrels, 82 percent of which went to compensate for legacy declines. This last point is key: with 82 percent of U.S. shale oil production going to replace declines (as compared to 72 percent in 2014), means only 18 percent of new U.S. shale oil production is contributing to the net growth in U.S. supply.Related: Low Oil Prices Could Cripple Texas Job GrowthFollowing the experience of 2015/2016, most market observers agree that U.S. shale production can’t grow meaningfully with WTI under $50 a barrel, WTI averaged under $50 both in 2015 ($48) and 2016 ($43). Thus, with WTI trading under $50 WTI today, it's fair to assume that U.S. shale growth will either slow in the coming months, or contract should prices remain here. As indicated earlier, U.S. shale oil production today is much larger, and with a much bigger legacy decline rate than in 2014; this means that a slight decrease in activity could have an outsized impact on total U.S. production. To illustrate this point, we can proceed with a theoretical example, if we were to assume the slowdown in U.S. shale activity was to slow new production growth from 644K barrels per month to 580K by the end of Q1/2019, the net annualized growth in U.S. production would decrease from roughly 1.3m barrels per year to 600K per year or a 54 percent decline. Obviously, the numbers are not static, the underlying legacy decline rate will eventually slow down as new production slows down, but directionally the example is very telling. Furthermore, to put such U.S. decline in context, a slowdown of 50 percent in U.S. production growth would wipe out 51 percent of the expected 1.5m non-OPEC production growth projected for next year (IEA OMR December 2018).What’s important to keep in mind is that as U.S. production grows, and as legacy declines continue to cannibalize a larger portion of new U.S. shale oil production, U.S. production becomes increasingly sensitive to slight changes in drilling and completion activity. Those relatively small changes can have major implications for global oil balances. This situation is unprecedented in the history of the oil market for no global oil supply source has ever matched the sharp decline rate associated with U.S. shale oil production.     Long-Term ImplicationsAs we have seen from the above, U.S. shale oil is highly responsive to changes in oil prices, this, in turn, introduces a new balancing force in the global oil market, a force that acts as a floor should prices decline under $50 a barrel (the economic threshold to produce shale oil). This same force also acts as a ceiling should prices rise above $70 WTI, with most shale fields becoming profitable at that price point.Contrary to conventional wisdom, the implications of the shale phenomenon are quite positive for non-shale oil companies. Its true that U.S. shale oil introduces an upper band to oil prices, however, this is not a negative since sharp spikes in oil prices are generally harmful for the global economy and for oil demand growth; this is especially the case in an age where electrified transportation is gaining market share. Most importantly, U.S. shale oil’s reactivity to price declines represents an economic floor to oil prices that will supplement OPEC efforts to balance the oil market: barring OPEC, oil prices could decline to extreme levels, exactly as happened in early 2016, with WTI trading as low as $26 a barrel with OPEC opting to stand still. Having a free market oil price stabilizing force as described is a boon for conventional producers, many of whom can generate strong returns within the $50-$70 shale oil price band. Prior to the arrival of U.S. shale oil, OPEC was the oil market only security lever, today U.S. shale oil present another lever. This added downside protection underpins non-shale operators’ cash flows during the lower leg of the cycle. As capital markets gain confidence in non-shale operators cash flows at the trough, the most dangerous part of the commodity cycle, valuations in the non-shale oil sector should increase, rather than decrease as they have been of late due to a fundamental misunderstanding regarding the balancing role of U.S. shale in the oil market.     Longer term, U.S. shale oil’s upper band will cease to be a factor as U.S. shale oil production plateaus in the 9/10m barrels range in the early 2020s. In that ideal scenario, shale oil will continue to be a downside balancing force while losing its ability to cap the market on the upside due to logistical and geological constraints. Having U.S. shale oil downside protection without having it flood the market on the upside is a magnificent gift to OPEC, and other conventional oil producers. By Nawar Alsaadi for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-New-Oil-Order.html,"Dec 31, 2018 at 12:05 | Nawar Alsaadi","Dec 31, 2018",The New Oil Order
2018-12-31,"Oil markets have always been cyclical, and now even more so with advanced electronic trading, more speculation (which often results in wider oil price swings) and more producers, including the resurgence of U.S. oil production, now reaching over 11 million barrels per day. Added to the cocktail of uncertainty are also a myriad of geopolitical and economic factors, including ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions, angst of U.S. Federal Reserve policy, and wars in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere, which make it increasingly difficult to forecast the direction for future oil prices.This dynamic has proven true over the past two-and-a-half months as market pundits have watched (often in amazement) how global oil prices reached multi-year highs in October, only to quickly plunge by 40 percent to date. Prices for global oil benchmark, London-traded Brent crude futures were trading in the mid-$80’s range in early October, while U.S. oil benchmark, NYMEX-traded West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were hovering in the mid $70’s-range, a comfortable price point for U.S. shale oil producers, and around $25per barrel above the average oil production break-even point for shale producers.However, amid all of the dismal economic news and problematic geopolitical developments, a group of bankers are sounding optimistic once again over future oil price forecasts. On Friday, Bloomberg said that many of the world’s largest banks are forecasting a rebound in oil prices next year as fears of a recession prove misplaced.According to a Bloomberg survey of oil analysts, Brent will average $70 a barrel in 2019, almost a third higher than its price on Thursday. Michael Cohen, head of energy and commodities research at Barclays Plc in New York, said “we could even see something similar to a V-shaped recovery next year, on two very important conditions. One, that the reduction in OPEC exports leads to a reduction in inventories. And two, that we don’t see a further deterioration in macroeconomic conditions.”The Bloomberg report added that despite a recent darkening outlook for the global economy amid prolonged trade disputes between the U.S. and China, and as the U.S. Federal Reserve embarks on tightening monetary policy, most commentators aren’t seeing an actual recession biting the oil market next year. The median forecast of 24 oil analysts in the Bloomberg survey projects that Brent crude futures will average exactly $70 a barrel in 2019. The price on Thursday was about $53.50 while the average so far in 2018 has been about $72. Meanwhile, the median forecast for WTI is $61.13. WTI futures traded at about $45.27 on Monday.  Related: Low Oil Prices Could Cripple Texas Job GrowthMichael Tran, a commodities strategist at RBC Capital Markets LLC, said that prices are nearing a bottom, while ““global supply and demand should reach a fine balance next year.” Bloomberg added that in the absence of a severe economic slump, most analysts anticipate that world oil consumption will continue to expand at roughly the pace seen in recent years, powered by emerging economies such as China.Downplaying the trade war variable?However, though the analysts surveyed by Bloomberg give credence to ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, it appears that unless a new trade deal is reached by the self-imposed March 2 deadline between the two sides, global oil demand will indeed recede amid more sluggish global economic growth, led by a slow down in Chinese manufacturing and exports. Since the U.S. and China are the world’s two largest economies, ongoing trade tensions are already hitting global supply chains, particularly in Asia. Numerous manufacturing companies have already exited China for greener pastures, including setting up shop in neighboring Southeast Asian economic tiger Vietnam.Japan, the world’s third largest economy and a major importer of both crude oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG), for its part, is already suffering economic fall out from the U.S.-China trade spate. In September, the Tokyo-based Nikkei Asian Review said that at least 60 percent of top Japanese companies expected earnings to be hurt by the trade war. If Washington and Beijing can’t reach a formal trade war cease-fire by March 2, that 60 percent figure could likely include nearly all top Japanese companies, while Japan’s GDP would also take a hit, as would oil demand growth in the country.A protracted trade war between the U.S. and China will also hit other OECD members. Last month, the group of developed economies downgraded its global growth forecast from 3.7 percent to 3.5 percent in 2019 and 2020. However, that growth forecast could likely be readjusted if the U.S. hikes existing tariffs on $200 bn worth of Chinese products to as high as 25 percent while slapping fresh duties on another $267 bn worth of Chinese exports would exacerbate the problem.By Tim Daiss for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/70-Oil-Could-Be-Right-Around-The-Corner.html,"Dec 31, 2018 at 11:32 | Tim Daiss","Dec 31, 2018",$70 Oil Could Be Right Around The Corner
2018-12-31,"The explosive growth of U.S. shale production has capped gains of international and U.S. oil prices, offsetting OPEC’s production cuts in the first half of the year and contributing to an emerging oil glut in the latter half in 2018.  OPEC has now forged a new pact with its Russia-led non-OPEC allies to contain the oil price decline to $50 a barrel Brent—a price that is not enough to balance any budget of a Middle Eastern oil producer.But the consequences of rising U.S. light oil production from the shale fields have also rippled through international oil flows and trade, making OPEC’s heavyweights such as Saudi Arabia fight for keeping market share in their most prized market and the world’s fastest-growing oil consumption region, Asia.Thanks to the booming shale production, U.S. light oil exports have increased, taking market shares out of the lighter grades that Saudi Arabia and its fellow OPEC members are exporting to Asia.Moreover, increased crude oil production in the U.S. has also resulted in higher oil product exports which, combined with higher Chinese refined product exports, have created an oversupply of products in Asia, crashing refining margins earlier in December.U.S. crude oil production has been breaking records in recent months, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Total U.S. petroleum exports have also been setting records over the past year, EIA data shows.U.S. light crude oil exports to Asia have also grown and even with China shunning American crude, U.S. sales to OPEC’s key market Asia have held relatively steady since August this year, according to data from Kpler compiled by Bloomberg.  Related: Low Oil Prices Could Cripple Texas Job GrowthAs OPEC is getting ready for another round of production cuts beginning January, Saudi Arabia for example is hell-bent on keeping its market share in Asia and has recently slashed the January prices of all its grades going to Asia, while it raised the prices for all grades bound for the U.S., Northwest Europe, and the Mediterranean. Saudi Aramco’s deepest cuts in Asian pricing were for the Super Light and Extra Light grades, slashed by US$2 and $1.50 a barrel from December’s prices, respectively. The official selling prices (OSPs) of Arab Light, Medium, and Heavy were also cut, by between $0.40 and $1.00 a barrel.The deepest cuts in the lighter grades reflect Saudi Arabia’s effort to keep its market share in Asia as competition from U.S. light oil intensifies, according to analysts.“Lights are [cut] very aggressively,” a sour crude oil trader told S&P Global Platts in early December, commenting on the Saudi pricing for Asia for January.“Guess they are trying to prevent too much US arb inflow,” the trader said.Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members also have to contend with increased refined product exports out of the U.S., as well as China, which are creating a glut of gasoline and naphtha, depressing refining margins in Asia.Related: ExxonMobil Faces Off With Venezuela’s NavyIn early December, the gasoline refining margin at the Singapore hub, viewed as a benchmark for Asia, slumped to a loss and to the lowest level against Brent prices since November 2011. Loss-making gasoline margins weighed on Asia’s overall refining profits, which hit in early December their lowest since August 2016, despite crumbling crude oil prices, according to data from Refinitiv Eikon, as carried by Reuters.China is reportedly raising its fuel export quota for 2019 by 13 percent, which could additionally weigh on product oversupply.According to data compiled by Bloomberg, this year average monthly U.S. exports to Asia of light distillates—including gasoline and naphtha—have been nearly triple the export levels over the past two years. The gasoline and other oil products glut comes just as OPEC and allies start the new production cuts of 1.2 million bpd. Faced with U.S. competition of lighter grades in Asia, OPEC and its largest producer Saudi Arabia are fighting hard for their market share in their prized export destination.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Shale-Challenges-OPECs-Oil-Dominance-In-Asia.html,"Dec 31, 2018 at 11:29 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Dec 31, 2018",U.S. Shale Challenges OPEC’s Oil Dominance In Asia
2018-12-31,"Canada’s drilling rig count fell by 61 rigs in the last week of December from a week earlier, with the annual decline at 66 rigs, per the latest weekly rig count report by Baker Hughes. As Canadian drillers gear up for winter season, the rig count usually drops before the end of the year, this year, the figures add a more grim shade to the landscape of the Canadian oil industry, which this year suffered a major slump of the local benchmark, Western Canadian Select, to West Texas Intermediate, at one time dipping to a discount of over US$50 to WTI.Over the last two weeks of the month and the year, according to the data, the number of active drilling rigs deployed in Canada fell by a combined 104 to just 70, highlighting the effect of low local oil prices but also the obligatory production cuts enforced by the Albertan government to arrest the slide in prices and clear excessive crude oil inventory.The production cut will begin at a rate of 325,000 bpd, to be reduced to 95,000 bpd once the excess supply is cleared, which is expected to happen within three months. Afterwards, the cuts will be in place until the end of next year.Not everyone in the local oil industry is thrilled with the production cut. Suncor was against it when the idea was first floated, proposed by the chief executive of peer Cenovus. Most large companies in the field, who also have processing capacity, are better placed to weather the effects of the lower prices as they refine their own crude oil. Premier Notley has also floated the idea of building a new refinery in Alberta that would absorb more of the oil that is produced in the province instead of shipping it to U.S. refiners at cut-throat rates.According to Canadian media reports from earlier this month, Albertan energy companies were interested in expanding the province’s processing capacity. Alberta has four refineries at present, with a combined refining capacity of 475,000 bpd. There are also two other specialized diesel-producing facilities that can refine 110,000 bpd of crude.A new refinery would indeed serve to stabilize prices of Canadian crude, but there is one problem: a refinery cannot be built in a month, even in a year. What’s more, some experts argue that Canada’s oil province already has too much refining capacity and the only solution to its price problem are more pipelines.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Canadian-Rig-Count-Slumps-At-Year-End.html,"Dec 31, 2018 at 10:30 | Irina Slav","Dec 31, 2018",Canadian Rig Count Slumps At Year-End
2018-12-28,"A day after the American Petroleum Institute pressured already stressed oil prices further with an unexpected inventory build, the Energy Information Administration reported instead that crude oil inventories were virtually unchanged for the week.At 441.4 million barrels, the inventories are within seasonal limits, the EIA said in its last weekly inventory report for the year.Refineries processed 17.4 million barrels of crude daily last week, producing 10.1million barrels daily of gasoline and 5.4 million bpd of distillate fuels. Inventories of gasoline added 3 million barrels at the end of the seven-day reporting period, and distillate fuel inventories staying unchanged.Crude oil, meanwhile, has been having an exciting week with sharp falls prompted by market-wide worries about an oversupply amid slowing global economic growth, followed by a partial rebound as traders took advantage of the low prices. As of the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at US$53.70 a barrel, up 1.84 percent from yesterday’s close, and West Texas Intermediate was changing hands for US$45.63 a barrel, up by as much as 2.29 percent.It seems nobody knows exactly which way prices would go within a space of a few hours right now, although it’s safe to say they would reflect stock market movements pretty accurately.“For the time being, the stock market and the oil market will echo each other,” a South Korean commodities analyst told Reuters today. “Global economic slowdown worries have been weighing on stock market movements, and oil prices are not free from those concerns.”Prices could begin to recover once OPEC cuts enter into effect in January although the effect may not be immediately apparent, unlike two years ago, when the first production cut agreement was struck. It looks like this time, the headwinds are stronger and a lot of positive economic data would be necessary to convince a worried market the global economy will need more oil.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/EIA-Inventory-Report-Stops-Price-Slide.html,"Dec 28, 2018 at 10:30 | Irina Slav","Dec 28, 2018",EIA Inventory Report Stops Price Slide
2018-12-26,"OPEC has come through some turbulent times in the last few years as oil prices fell to decade lows. It has implemented production cuts, has rallied Russia to climb onboard the production cut train, has weathered the rise of US shale to never-before-seen highs, has extended those production cuts, has lifted production to quell a nervous market post-Iranian sanctions, and then has managed to pull a rabbit out of a hat by agreeing to yet another production cut—and OPEC is not finished yet.As we approach the new year, the 15-member-strong OPEC is facing another set of challenges. Here are some of the challenges they will face in 2019:Manuel Quevedo: OPEC’s leadership is crucial to its success. It operates under a rotating presidency, and for 2019, that honor is bestowed upon none other than Venezuela’s Manuel Quevedo.Manuel Quevedo has zero oil industry experience, taking over Venezuela’s crisis-stricken PDVSA and oil minister of the nation (which is pretty much the same thing). Instead, Quevedo’s experience is with the military, serving as National Guard major general prior to his position as insta-oil czar in a country that is falling apart at the seams. Quevedo was appointed in late 2017 to right the wrong ship that is PDVSA—and was given extra powers—let’s call it a special dispensation—to “create, annul or modify” deals involving PDVSA its subsidiaries. His reign dispensed with nearly 70 PDVSA executives in a massive “anti-corruption” sweep that some have labeled a mere power grab, despite Maduro’s insistence to the contrary.Quevedo has been, so far, unable to right the ship, with Venezuela’s oil production and oil revenues falling at unprecedented rates, even when oil prices rallied mid-year. Quevedo has instead instilled fear into PDVSA workers and has implemented some policies that some argue have brought PDVSA closer to—not further from—the brink of ruin.A Maduro loyalist through and through, Quevedo will now take over not only PDVSA and Venezuela’s oil industry, but will assume the rotating presidency of the most influential oil industry body in the world. But his lack of experience is only part of the trouble. OPEC has been the target of Tweets by US President Donald Trump—add to that President Trump’s vehement opposition to Maduro—the subject of US sanctions—and OPEC may find itself even more of a target. The worst thing for OPEC would be for Venezuela’s tenuous relationship with Washington to mar OPEC’s already tenuous relationship with Washington.Related: UBS: Expect $80 Brent Next YearQuevedo is also strongly backing El Petro—its alleged oil-backed cryptocurrency—and has supposedly been invited by OPEC to speak about the rise of El Petro sometime in 2019.NOPEC: Another hurdle OPEC faces in 2019 is the proposed US legislation that would allow legal claims against OPEC for manipulating oil prices, called the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act (NOPEC) In mid-2018, OPEC advised its members to stop referring to oil prices specifically, instead urging them to use phrases such as “balanced market” and the like. OPEC’s preemptive strike speaks to the plausibility that this legislation could be passed, as President Donald Trump’s strained relationship with OPEC plays out on Twitter and in the legislative branch.Qatar walked out of OPEC just one month ago, potentially distancing itself from this legislation that if passed, would open up a whole can of legal issues for the cartel as it would end anti-trust laws, revoking the sovereign immunity that until now has protected OPEC members from legal actions regarding price fixing.Libya: Libya managed to secure an exemption from the OPEC production cuts that will go into effect on January 1, 2019, allegedly due to its unstable oil production that ebbs and flows as infighting continues to batter its oil industry like a plague. But this exemption, and its chronic outages of its largest oilfield, Sharara, poses a challenge to OPEC, who is struggling to balance production with demand. As Libya’s production increases and decreases, OPEC has difficulty responding immediately to offset the ebbs and flows, and no single country has been fingered—at least not to our knowledge—to increase or decrease production to offset Libya’s production. The unknowns with Libya create an unknown for all of OPEC.Russia, et al: The non-OPEC signees of the deal to cut production expose OPEC to a greater risk. OPEC needs heavyweight Russia on board with the production cuts. Russia has agreed to cut production, along with several other lesser non-OPEC producers. But it has also said that it will be a gradual production cut, beginning in January but not reaching full cut volumes until March. Here, Russia holds some sway, exacerbated by its cozy relationship with Venezuela and major general Quevedo, who has been the recipient of substantial loans courtesy of Russia’s generosity. OPEC has recruited Russia out of necessity, and being in bed with Russia exposes OPEC to greater risks. Should Russia renege on the deal with OPEC, the production cut agreement would be largely toothless.  Related: Canada’s LNG Dream Just Turned Into A NightmareSpeculators: Oil prices still respond to OPEC chatter, leaked information, statements to the press, and monthly production figures that either show OPEC’s success in hitting professed production targets. But the latter half of 2018 saw the beginning of a partial immunity to such news, and as the oil market continues its recently acquired anxiety disorder, 2019 is unlikely to look much different.  What OPEC could previously achieve with a mere promise to curb production (or increase production), will now be met with increasing apathy—show, don’t tell will be the new norm for the oil market as traders work against OPEC, albeit unconsciously.US Shale: The United States shale industry has been a thorn in OPEC’s side since the cartel’s initial “pump oil until we crush them” policy rolled out prior to its first round of production cuts in 2017. The rise of US shale will continue to be so throughout 2019 as production increases continue unabated. Unlike OPEC members, US shale producers are only inhibited by price, and even that has proven to be a nondeterrent to increasing production. For every barrel that OPEC doesn’t produce, oil producers in the United States will happily export in its stead. The United States’ entry as top dog when it comes to oil production at 11.7 million bpd toward the end of 2018 has taken much wind out of OPEC’s sails, making it more difficult for OPEC to manipulate the market. This will continue throughout 2019.OPEC will have an uphill battle in 2019, but its influence as a cartel should not be dismissed entirely. The oil market in 2019 will be largely affected by OPEC—just not single-handedly by OPEC as other major players rise to sway the market as well.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Whats-In-Store-For-OPEC-In-2019.html,"Dec 26, 2018 at 10:10 | Julianne Geiger","Dec 26, 2018",What’s In Store For OPEC In 2019?
2018-12-24,"In 2013, I began warning about the risk to oil prices due to the ongoing imbalances between global supply and demand. Those warnings fell on deaf ears as it was believed that “oil prices could only go higher from here.”It didn’t take long for those predictions to play out. In May of 2014, I wrote:“While it is likely oil prices could get a bit of a bump from a decline in the U.S. dollar, ultimately it will come down to the fundamentals longer term. It is quite clear that the speculative rise in oil prices due to the ‘fracking miracle’ has come to its inglorious but expected conclusion…It is quite apparent that some lessons are simply never learned. “Of course, as with all things, particularly when it comes to commodities, it doesn’t take long for speculation to once again grab hold and drive prices higher in the short-term despite the long-term fundamental problems which still exist.In September of 2017, I wrote a piece reviewing those fundamentals.“I have been getting a tremendous number of emails as of late asking if the latest rally in oil prices, and related energy stocks, is sustainable or is it another ‘trap’ as has been witnessed previously.As regular readers know, we exited oil and gas stocks back in mid-2014 and have remained out of the sector for technical and fundamental reasons for the duration. While there have been some opportunistic trading setups, the technical backdrop has remained decidedly bearish.”The conclusion was not what most were hoping for.“While there is hope the production cuts will continue into 2018, a bulk of the current price gain has likely already been priced in. With oil prices once again overbought on a monthly basis, the risk of disappointment is substantial.”Well, here we are wrapping up 2018 and the prices of both energy-related shares and oil have been disappointing.The expected decline in oil prices is more important than just the relative decline in share prices of energy-related stocks. As I wrote previously, energy prices are highly correlated to economic activity. To wit:“Oil is a highly sensitive indicator relative to the expansion or contraction of the economy. Given that oil is consumed in virtually every aspect of our lives, from the food we eat to the products and services we buy, the demand side of the equation is a tell-tale sign of economic strength or weakness.  Related: UBS: Expect $80 Brent Next YearThe chart below combines interest rates, inflation, and GDP into one composite indicator to provide a clearer comparison to oil prices. One important note is that oil tends to trade along a pretty defined trend…until it doesn’t. Given that the oil industry is very manufacturing and production intensive, breaks of price trends tend to be liquidation events which have a negative impact on the manufacturing and CapEx spending inputs into the GDP calculation.”(Click to enlarge) “As such, it is not surprising that sharp declines in oil prices have been coincident with downturns in economic activity, a drop in inflation, and a subsequent decline in interest rates.”Since then, the price of oil has declined further as economic weakness continues to gain traction globally. Despite the occasional rally, it’s hard to see the outlook for oil is encouraging on both fundamental and technical levels. The charts for WTI remain bearish, while the fundamentals remain basically “Economics 101: too much supply, too little demand.” The parallel with 2014 is there if you want to see it.(Click to enlarge) The current levels of supply potentially create a longer-term issue for prices globally particularly in the face of weaker global demand due to demographics, energy efficiencies, and debt.Many point to the 2008 commodity crash as THE example as to why oil prices are destined to rise in the near term. The clear issue remains supply as it relates to the price of any commodity. With drilling in the Permian Basin expanding currently, any “cuts” by OPEC have already been offset by increased domestic production. As I stated previously, any rise in oil prices beyond $55/bbl would likely make the OPEC “cuts” very short-lived which indeed turned out to be the case. As noted in the chart above, the difference between 2008 and today is that previously the world was fearful of “running out” of oil versus worries about an “oil glut” today. The issues of supply versus price become clearer if we look further back in history to the last crash in commodity prices which marked an extremely long period of oil price suppression as supply was reduced.(Click to enlarge) The problem with the recent surge in oil prices was that it was being driven by speculative excess. As I noted in “Everyone Is On The Same Side Of The Boat:”“Of course, the cycle of rising oil prices leading to increased optimism which begets bullish bets on oil continues to press prices higher. However, it is also the exuberance which has repeatedly set up the next fall. As shown below, bets on crude oil prices are sitting near the highest levels on record and substantially higher than what was seen at the peak of oil prices prior to 2008 and 2014.”(Click to enlarge) When I wrote that in May of this year (2018), it received a lot of criticism about my misunderstanding of global demand and explanations of why oil prices could only go higher.It didn’t take long for reality to take hold.The Headwinds For Oil RemainIn 2008, when prices crashed, the supply of into the marketplace had hit an all-time low while global demand was at an all-time high. Remember, the fears of “peak oil” was rampant in news headlines and in the financial markets. Of course, the financial crisis took hold and quickly realigned prices with demand.(Click to enlarge) Of course, the supply-demand imbalance, combined with suppressed commodity prices in 2008, was the perfect cocktail for a surge in prices as the “fracking miracle” came into focus. The surge of supply alleviated the fears of oil company stability and investors rushed back into energy-related companies to “feast” on the buffet of accelerating profitability into the infinite future.The problem currently, and as of yet not fully recognized, is the supply-demand imbalance has once again reverted. With supply now at the highest levels on record, and global demand growth weak due to a rolling debt-cycle driven global deflationary cycle, the dynamics for a repeat of the pre-2008 surge in prices is unlikely.(Click to enlarge) The supply-demand problem is not likely to be resolved over the course of a few months either. The current dynamics of the financial markets, global economies, and the current level of supply is more akin to that of the early-1980’s. Even if OPEC does continue to reduce output, it will continue to be insufficient to offset the increases from shale field production.(Click to enlarge) Since oil production, at any price, is the major part of the revenue streams of energy-related companies, it is unlikely they will dramatically gut their production in the short-term. The important backdrop is extraction from shale continues to become cheaper and more efficient all the time. In turn, this lowers the price point where production becomes profitable increases the supply coming to market.Then there is the demand side of the equation.  Related: $50 Oil Won’t Kill U.S. ShaleFor example, my friend Jill Mislinski discussed the issue of a weak economic backdrop.“There are profound behavioral issues apart from gasoline prices that are influencing miles traveled. These would include the demographics of an aging population in which older people drive less, continuing high unemployment, the ever-growing ability to work remote in the era of the Internet and the use of ever-growing communication technologies as a partial substitute for face-to-face interaction.”(Click to enlarge) The problem with dropping demand, of course, is the potential for the creation of a “supply glut” that leads to a continued suppression in oil prices.The headwinds to higher oil prices from the demand side come in a variety of forms:• Weak economic global growth over the last decade which will remain weak going forward• Slow and steady growth of renewable/alternative sources of energy• Technological improvements in energy production, storage and transfer, and;• A rapidly aging global demographicAdd to those issues that over the next few years EVERY major auto supplier will be continuously rolling out more efficient automobiles including larger offerings of hybrid and fully electric vehicles.All this boils down to a long-term, secular, and structurally bearish story.With respect to investors, the argument can be made that oil prices have likely found a long-term bottom in the $40 range. However, the fundamental tailwinds for substantially higher prices are still vacant. OPEC won’t keep cutting production forever, the global economy remains weak, efficiencies are suppressing demand.Furthermore, given the length of the current economic expansion, the onset of the next recession is likely closer than not. A recession will negatively impact oil prices (which are driven by commodity traders) and energy investments as the proverbial “baby is thrown out with the bathwater.”This is where we will be looking for long-term bargains in the space.By Real Investment AdviceMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Why-The-Oil-Price-Bear-Market-Persists.html,"Dec 24, 2018 at 12:47 | Lance Roberts","Dec 24, 2018",Why The Oil Price Bear Market Persists
2018-12-24,"This year has been a crazy ride for the oil industry, which saw the price of Brent crude seesaw from $66.87 on the first day of the year, to a high of $86.29 in early October, back to $66.28 in mid-November—almost precisely back to where we started—and then closing out the year right before Christmas at a disappointing $54.10.Yes, typical catalysts such as inventory and capacity affect oil prices; they always have. But there were other forces at play in 2018 that significantly influenced the price of oil in 2018, and here is our list of those important individuals in 2018, and those to watch for 2019.Fatih Birol – As head of the International Energy Agency (IEA), Dr. Fatih Birol has made several lists in years past of influential oil figures. While he doesn’t directly control production, inventory, prices, or policy, his words—usually regarding oil demand or production forecasts. In late 2018, the head of the IEA went further than offering gloomy oil demand figures for the coming year, issuing warnings to the world’s largest oil producers, urging them not to cut oil output, and warning the market that the higher oil prices heading into November were such that it was already high enough to dent demand.“Currently markets are very well supplied but we should not forget that spare capacity in Saudi Arabia is very thin, therefore cutting the production significantly today by key oil producers may have some negative implications for the markets and further tightening the markets…My appeal to all producers and consumers across the world is to have common sense in these difficult days.”—Fatih Birol, November 2018Oil prices had already started to slide leading up to Dr. Birol’s plea but had rallied somewhat the four days prior. Brent stood at $66.79 on November 19 but fell sharply to $62.53 by the next day as speculators latched onto fear that oil demand might falter.Mohammed bin Salman – Essentially the ruler of the heavyweight oil producer Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman has exerted unofficial—but significant—influence over the oil markets. His pursuit of the war in Yemen, his push for a blockade of neighboring Qatar, his attempt to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil (Vision 2030), his massive “corruption” crackdown that helped to solidify his power, and implementing a trade row with Canada. His single biggest influence in 2018 was likely his push to extend OPEC’s production cuts—achieved largely through his deepening relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin—as higher prices are the only way MbS can reap higher oil prices, which is the only path toward continuing his costly modernization plans for The Kingdom.  Related: OPEC+ Deal Not Enough To Save The Oil Market“We are working to shift from a year-to-year agreement to a 10 to 20-year agreement.” – Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, March 2018Khalid A. Al-Falih – If MbS is the string-puller of the Saudi oil world, Al-Falih is the implementer—and often a more visible one at that. It is precisely that visibility which gives Al-Falih the power to sway oil prices. As Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, Al-Falih has often been touted as the world’s largest influencer in the oil markets today. While we are not committed to giving him that crown this year, Al-Falih is certainly in the top five influencers. His mere words to the press are quoted, tweeted, cited, and hung on by every single oil trader in the world. And like MbS, his ties to Russia, which went a long way towards rallying Russia to join in the OPEC cut extension in June, and OPEC cuts 2.0 in November, which will start in 2019. Further, Saudi Arabia, under Al-Falih’s guidance, curtailed oil exports to the United States in an effort to manipulate oil inventories in the US—and thus influence the price of oil indirectly by changing the most watched and most transparent oil metric in the world—US inventories as reported by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the American Petroleum Institute (API). Like others on this list, such as Alexander Novak and President Donald Trump, Al-Falih’s power comes mostly from his reputation—and his words have sway absent even of any real policy change or action. His power also comes largely from Aramco’s professed ability to turn on and off its taps to manipulate oil’s fundamentals on a large scale.“We will meet any demand that materializes.” Al-Falih October 2018President Donald Trump – Here is the newest player on the world’s most prominent catalyst for oil price swings. For better or for worse, love him or hate him, President Donald Trump has undeniably changed the course of the oil industry in 2018, and not just in the United States. His late-night Tweets has sent oil prices falling, has sent OPEC scrambling, and has sent Saudi Arabia a different tune to sing.Some may staunchly deny that President Trump has any real power to change oil prices, but his policy changes—from the biofuel mandate, opening up offshore drilling, his sanctions on Iran that went into effect in November, and the waivers he allowed to some of the world’s thirstiest oil consumers—have had a profound effect not just on market sentiment, but on oil’s fundamentals as well. But perhaps his single largest influence on the oil market as his oil-related tweets, which have in 2018 caught the eye of every speculator. His tweets, particularly those that chastised OPEC for restricting output and thus manipulating oil prices, have had a significant and even immediate effect on prices.“Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!” – President Donald Trump, Twitter, December 2018 on eve of OPEC meeting.Nicolas Maduro – With Venezuela now definitively in shambles, Nicolas Maduro still seems bent on steering his shipwreck of a country right off a colossal waterfall, and its entire oil industry along with it. Because the country is home to the largest oil reserves in the world, the fate of its oil industry impacts in a profound way, the entire oil industry. Maduro’s clanging cymbal of promised change has done little to allay fears that its lost production will translate into a shortage of oil elsewhere, but Venezuela’s rapidly declining production, thanks in large part to Maduro’s mismanagement and plundering of PDVSA, has bolstered oil prices by tightening supply, and has provided some relief to OPEC as they struggled throughout 2018 to meet stringent production cut quotas. Despite Maduro’s insistence that it will start to trade oil its new currency, El Petro, little has come of his grand scheme.General Khalifa Haftar (aka Gaddafi 2.0) – 2018 has been a year of fear that major oil producers such as Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United States would not be able to compensate for production losses elsewhere, such as Iran, Venezuela, and Libya. Granted a waiver from the original production cut agreement that OPEC hashed in late 2017, Libya was watched for much of early 2018 as the troubled country’s oil production ebbed and flowed thanks to infighting that was kept in check, for the most part, singlehandedly by General Khalifa Haftar.Vladimir Putin – While Igor Sechin may be head of Russian oil giant Rosneft, Putin is unquestionably in control of the country’s oil policies and production. Sechin is no puppet, for sure, but is still dwarfed by Putin’s larger-than-life persona. From deals with Saudi Arabia and OPEC to curb production—the single most meaningful metric that moved markets this year—to Turkish Stream and anti-Trump quotes, Putin is decidedly affecting oil prices. Along with Al-Khalid and President Donald Trump, Putin’s quotes in the media have sway.  Related: UBS: Expect $80 Brent Next Year“President Trump has said he thinks the oil price is too high. Well, probably to some extent he’s right ... But let’s be frank, such oil prices are to some extent the result of the U.S. administration,” Vladimir Putin, October 2018.Igor Sechin – Known to some as the Darth Vader of Russia, and arguably the second most influential man in Russia after Putin, Sechin has dispensed with his competition when it suited him to do so (Bashneft, Yukos). With this history in mind, Sechin leads and others follow. Some in Russia might consider Sechin a more powerful figure than Putin and claim that Rosneft’s rise is attributed to Sechin’s ruthless actions.Elon Musk – Musk perhaps would shudder to find himself on a list of prominent oilmen, but this year’s list of powerful oilmen would not be complete without at least mentioning Musk’s significant impact on the oil industry. His quest to put EVs in the forefront of the world’s mind has without question pushed other auto manufacturers to develop EVs of their own, and at a quickened pace than what would otherwise have been. This push to get more EVs on the road, and the desire of other manufacturers to not be left behind, has sparked concern in the oil industry that its days are numbered.Honorable MentionsThe last three on our list are honorable mentions, but their influence should not be downplayed. Their policies have undoubtedly affected the markets, but perhaps with not as much fanfare as those in our list above.Xi Jinping – China is at the heart of the world’s oil demand, and Xi Jinping’s decision mid-June to not issue any more solar power installations tariffs, and to cut the feed-in tariff subsidy has affected oil demand in the country, by shifting its energy demand away from solar and towards oil and natural gas.Trudeau – Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau created nearly single-handedly a disaster of monumental proportions in Canada’s oil industry, by not backing pipeline expansion with enough force. This lack of support indirectly created the largest discount ever in Western Canadian Select to West Texas Intermediate, as pipeline constraints restricted the flow of WCS to US refiners as anti-oil British Columbia and oil powerhouse Alberta duked it out with trade wars of their own.Alexander Novak – This is our third Russian on the list, and his power as Russia’s Energy Minister mostly consists of words spoken to the press. His alleged bromance with Saudi counterpart Khalid Al-Falih that helped to solidify cooperation between two of the three largest oil producers in the world has led to an alliance that is one for the history books. As Russia allied with OPEC in the production cuts, Novak helped to create an entity that could swing prices by manipulating the world’s oil supply. Without Russia, OPEC’s power to manipulate would be severely diminished, and some would argue ineffective.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Biggest-Oilmen-Of-2018.html,"Dec 24, 2018 at 11:44 | Julianne Geiger","Dec 24, 2018",The Biggest Oilmen Of 2018
2018-12-21,"If the goal of the OPEC+ cuts was to boost oil prices, then the deal is clearly failing.OPEC+ is scrambling to figure out a way to rescue oil prices from another deep downturn. WTI is now down into the mid-$40s and Brent into the mid-$50s, both a 15-month low. U.S. shale continues to soar, even if shale producers themselves are now facing financial trouble with prices so low. Oil traders are clearly skeptical that OPEC+ is either willing or capable of balancing the oil market.OPEC+ thought they secured a strong deal in Vienna in early December, but more needs to be done, it seems. OPEC’s Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo wrote a letter to the cartel’s members, arguing that they need to increase the cuts. Initially, the OPEC+ coalition suggested that producers should lower output by 2.5 percent, but Barkindo said that the cuts need to be more like 3 percent in order to reach the overall 1.2 million-barrel-per-day reduction.More importantly, the group needs to detail how much each country should be producing. “In the interests of openness and transparency, and to support market sentiment and confidence, it is vital to make these production adjustments publicly available,” Barkindo told members in the letter, according to Reuters. By specifying exactly how much each country will reduce, the thinking seems to be, it will go a long way to assuaging market anxiety about the group’s seriousness.Still, the plunge in oil prices this month is evidence that traders are not convinced. The view is “that the U.S. will continue to grow like gangbusters regardless of price and overwhelm any OPEC action,” Helima Croft, the chief commodities strategist at Canadian broker RBC, told the Wall Street Journal. “Unless there is a real geopolitical blowup, it could take time for these cuts to really shift sentiment.”  Related: Interest Rate Hike Hits Oil HardWhile cuts from producers like Saudi Arabia will help take supply off of the market, OPEC might help erase the surplus in another unintended way. Bloomberg raises the possibility that low oil prices could increase turmoil in some OPEC member states. The price meltdown between 2014 and 2016 led to, or at least exacerbated, outages in Libya, Venezuela and Nigeria. The same could happen again.Just about all OPEC members need much higher oil prices in order to balance their books. Saudi Arabia needs roughly $88 per barrel for its budget to breakeven. Libya needs $114. Nigeria needs $127. Venezuela needs a whopping $216. Only Kuwait – at $48 per barrel – can balance its books at prevailing prices. Brent is trading in the mid-$50s right now.That raises the prospect of more unrest. Venezuela’s supply losses are assured – and largely already factored into market forecasts – although the rate of decline remains uncertain. But further unexpected outages are possible, and become more likely with lower prices. Libya and Nigeria are the most likely sources of instability. Unexpected disruptions in supply in 2019 could tighten up the market.Still, while there are many problems facing OPEC+ as it seeks to balance the market, one important factor lies mostly out of the group’s control. Much of the OPEC+ discussion focuses on supply-side dynamics – how much the group should be producing in order to achieve some price target. But the problems sweeping over the oil market right now could be even larger.Specifically, a global economic slowdown could translate into much slower demand, a problem that OPEC+ cannot fix. Sinking oil prices isn’t just a matter of market expectations of oversupply from U.S. shale.   The financial turmoil and brewing economic slowdown is clearly overwhelming the OPEC+ cuts, as well as the jawboning that some OPEC officials have tried over the past week. Stock markets plunged in recent days after the Federal Reserve tightened interest rates yet again and signaled two more rate hikes in 2019.There haven’t yet been any dramatic revisions to 2019 oil demand from leading energy forecasters, such as the EIA or IEA. But, then again, the financial instability and the souring oil market have only cropped up recently. The IEA has maintained a 1.4-mb/d growth rate for demand next year, but take that with a grain of salt. Demand revisions could be forthcoming. OPEC+ may have to keep its supply curbs in place for the full year in 2019, but it’s unclear if even that can push prices back up to where they were two months ago.By Nick Cunningham, Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/OPEC-Deal-Not-Enough-To-Save-The-Oil-Market.html,"Dec 21, 2018 at 17:26 | Nick Cunningham","Dec 21, 2018",OPEC+ Deal Not Enough To Save The Oil Market
2018-12-21,"Russia continues to be the key partner of OPEC and its largest producer Saudi Arabia in managing the oil market. For a second production cut deal in a row, Moscow joined the cartel’s cuts, taking the lion’s share of the cuts intended for the non-OPEC members of the pact.For a second production cut in row, Russia will be gradually reducing output and could reach its share of cuts by the end of the first quarter, its Energy Minister Alexander Novak said this week.Russia’s oil production will be cut from the October baseline, which was a new post-Soviet record high of 11.41 million bpd. Between May and October this year, Russia had reversed its entire 300,000-bpd cut that was pledged as part of the initial deal and added even more on top of that, as Moscow, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Kuwait pumped more oil to offset what was expected to be a steep drop in Iranian oil supply due to the U.S. sanctions.The production cuts may have postponed plans of some Russian oil companies to boost output, but the reductions and ramp-up in a few months have shown Russia’s capability to play the role of a key global swing producer, second only to Saudi Arabia, according to analysts at S&P Global Platts.“Russia’s rapid production growth from May through October demonstrated its ability to be a key swing producer, at a level below that of Saudi Arabia but as high as any other country in the world,” S&P Global Platts Analytics’ Paul Sheldon says.While several of the non-OPEC nations will largely rely on natural decline—take Mexico for example—Russia will be purposefully cutting 228,000 bpd between January and June 2019, more than half of non-OPEC’s 400,000-bpd total reduction pledge.Although the new OPEC+ production cut deal is currently for a six-month period with an option to review in April, and it’s not certain how long these cuts will actually last, Russia’s production could continue to surprise on the upside after the cuts expire, Platts Analytics says, contrary to the gloomy scenarios proposed by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Russia’s own energy ministry.Russia’s oil production could peak as early as in 2021 due to high taxes and costs, provided there are no benefits for exploration or tax incentives introduced, Novak said in September this year. By 2021, Russia’s oil production will rise to 570 million tons, which, without more benefits and lower taxes, could be the peak oil production, Novak warned.  Related: Interest Rate Hike Hits Oil HardIf current production trends continue, and if Russia doesn’t do anything to further stimulate oil exploration and new field development, after 2021, production may start to fall and reach just 310 million tons by 2035, that is, Russia’s oil production could drop by 44 percent by then, according to the energy minister.Due to the OPEC+ production cuts, Russia’s crude oil production in 2019 could be lower than originally planned—at 552 million tons, or 11.085 million bpd, Novak said this week.According to Novak, plans for next year were for Russia’s oil production to stand at 555 million tons-556 million tons, or 11.145 million bpd-11.165 million bpd, but a lot will depend on Russia’s oil production policy after the first half of 2019.The IEA, for its part, sees a possible decline after 2020, “if Russian companies are unable to secure the technology and financing necessary for the next generation of projects and the government fails to offer more extensive tax breaks to encourage investment.”Yet, Platts Analytics’ Sheldon begs to differ:“We take any doomsday scenarios with a grain of salt. Betting on any decline in Russian production has been a losing proposition since 1999.”  Related: Major LNG Shortage Increasingly LikelyRussia’s huge reserves, growing technological capabilities of domestic companies, and an eventual removal of the Western sanctions could also help Russian oil production “at some point down the road,” Sheldon says. According to Platts Analytics, Russia’s oil production will be in the 11.3 million bpd-11.4 million bpd range between 2027 and 2040.To stimulate production and development of oil fields, Russia is also overhauling its complex taxation system for the oil industry—currently some of the most burdensome oil taxes in the world. Moscow will test in 2019 a new profit-based tax for several types of oil fields, including such in the key Western Siberian region, which is expected to ease the tax burden and at the same time encourage field development.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Key-Swing-Producer-Behind-The-OPEC-Deal.html,"Dec 21, 2018 at 17:19 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Dec 21, 2018",The Key Swing Producer Behind The OPEC+ Deal
2018-12-21,"Energy planners in Saudi Arabia must be scratching their heads in wonder, even possibly despair. The oil-rich kingdom had picked itself up after threats of near economic collapse in 2015-2016 amid a then oversupply scenario in global oil markets with prices that dropped to multi-year lows, but now things are looking grim once again.After the kingdom's ill-fated decision in late 2014 to open the oil production spigots and ramp up production in the midst of an oil supply glut mostly due to increased U.S. shale oil production, prices tumbled. They had reached over $100 per barrel in mid-2014, but by January 2016 had dipped below the psychologically important and economically damaging $30 per barrel price point.The results for the Saudis was cataclysmic, with problems ranging from historically high budget deficits (reaching a then-record high of $98 billion in 2015) to being forced to put in place its first ever and politically unpopular austerity measures as well as issuing its first international bond sale to raise much-needed funds.By October 2016, with Saudi state coffers low and the government bleeding red ink, Mohamed Al Tuwaijri, the Saudi deputy economic minister, said in a rare appearance on national television, “if we (Saudi Arabia) didn’t take any reform measures, and if the global economy stays the same, then we’re doomed for bankruptcy in three to four years.""The formation of OPEC+By late 2016, the Saudis had had enough and were forced to turn to non-OPEC producers to stop the pain, including oil production heavyweight and longtime adversary Russia, forming what is now known as OPEC+. The new group of oil producing partners was able to trim oil production enough to restore OECD oil inventory levels back to five year averages around the third quarter of 2017 and not only put a floor under prices, in essence restoring a semblance of market equilibrium, but their actions drove prices to four year highs this October, so high that it created concerns of demand destruction.  Related: Can China Save South Sudan’s Oil Sector?As the Saudis, albeit with Russia’s help, regained control of global oil markets, it seemed that the kingdom got its swagger back, including a global charm offensive by its young and charismaticde facto leader Mohammed bin Salman. His softer tone with longtime regional foe Israel, his close relationship with the Trump administration and his plans to revamp the Saudi economy, including less dependency on oil revenue seemed too good to be true - but at the end of the day, it fell apart.The global oil price plungeGlobal oil markets became saturated again, oil prices have quickly dropped around 40 percent since reaching October highs, along with slowing global economic growth in large part due to ongoing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing are setting in. On top of this laundry list of oil market worries, the world’s top three oil producers, the U.S., Russia and Saudi Arabia, have been pumping oil at record levels.Waning Saudi prestigeHowever, the biggest detriment in the Saudi plan to revamp both its global image and its economy has been Saudi implication in the controversial death of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in early October in the Saudi consulate in Turkey. Now, amid still fresh wounds to Saudi prestige as well as doubt over bin Salman’s ability to rule the kingdom, foreign investment in Saudi Arabia is drying up, possibly taking the kingdom precipitously close to the dismal days of 2015 and 2016 when it looked like Saudi Arabia could come apart at the seams.  Related: Chinese Refiners Aren’t Buying U.S. CrudeMeanwhile, oil prices are continuing their downward trajectory, with wilder swings that previous markets, likely due to increased speculation and more electric trading of the commodity. Global oil benchmark Brent crude is now trading in the mid-$50s range, while U.S. oil benchmark, NYMEX-traded West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is hovering in the mid-$40s range, a price point unthinkable just two months ago.It remains to be seen if the new OPEC+ oil production deal to trim output by 1.2 million b/d, starting in January and lasting for six months, with a review period in April, will help oil market jitters and be enough to dry up oversupply. However, given that the U.S. will continue to ramp up production, to an U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated 12.1 million b/d or higher next year, and with the likelihood that no trade deal will be reached between Washington and Beijing by their self-imposed March 2 deadline, oil markets will likely remain nervous with prices through the first quarter remaining in the mid $40 to mid $50s range or possibly lower, at which point déjà vu will set in for Saudi Arabia, all too reminiscent of a few years ago when the kingdom barely survived economically.

2018-12-21,"Total U.S. oil production around 2025 will almost equal the combined production of Russia and Saudi Arabia, Fatih Birol, the Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), told Turkish state-run Anadolu Agency on Friday.The huge growth in U.S. shale production will completely change the balance of oil markets, Birol told the news agency.The IEA’s Oil 2018 report from earlier this year sees the United States dominating the global oil supply growth over the next five years.OPEC capacity will grow only modestly by 2023, while most of the growth will come from non-OPEC countries, led by the United States, “which is becoming ever more dominant in the global oil market,” the IEA said.Driven by light tight oil, U.S. production is seen growing by 3.7 million bpd by 2023, more than half of the total global production capacity growth of 6.4 million bpd expected by then. Total liquids production in the United States—including conventional oil, shale, and natural gas liquids—will reach nearly 17 million bpd by 2023, “easily making it the top global producer, and nearly matching the level of its domestic products demand,” the IEA said in March this year.  “The United States is set to put its stamp on global oil markets for the next five years,” Birol said back then.The U.S. is currently pumping oil at record levels of more than 11 million bpd, while Russia and Saudi Arabia—which also hit record highs in October and November, respectively—will curtail 230,000 bpd and 322,000 bpd of their production in the first six months of 2019, respectively.In its December Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects U.S. crude oil production to have averaged 11.5 million bpd in November, up by 150,000 bpd from October, thanks to platforms resuming normal operations after hurricane-related outages in October. The EIA sees U.S. crude oil production averaging 10.9 million bpd this year, jumping from 9.4 million bpd in 2017. The forecast for next year’s U.S. crude oil production currently stands at 12.1 million bpd.

The reason the oil market was structured as such was due to the nature of conventional oil production, most non-OPEC oil production prior to U.S. shale oil fell in one of two categories: major offshore projects that took 5 to 7 years to build (North Sea, Gulf of Mexico … etc.) or mature conventional onshore fields (U.S. conventional fields, Russian Siberian fields … etc.); both of these conventional oil supply sources were either non-responsive, or only slowly reactive, to changes in the oil price, major offshore oil projects tended to come online regardless of the oil price environment, while conventional onshore oil production with shallow decline rates (sub-10 percent) meant that even a slowdown in drilling would not impact total production in any meaningful way for an extended period of time.The aforementioned state of affairs meant that it was up to OPEC to adjust production to balance the market in case of abrupt supply or demand changes, OPEC had (and still has) the flexibility to withdraw millions of barrels from the market within a month or two if such a need arose (OPEC withdrawing 4m barrels from the market following the financial crisis in 2008/2009 is a case in point).The arrival of U.S. shale oil in size to the scene in 2014 has upended the OPEC/non-OPEC balancing act, by introducing a medium-term oil supply balancing mechanism that in the long run will prove supportive to the oil market, and especially so to non-shale oil producers.Analysis Non-OPEC production trends following the oil crash in 2014 are instrumental in demonstrating the points discussed in the introduction. Following the oil crash of late 2014, U.S. crude production (lower 48 ex-GOM) declined by one million barrels (EIA data) between December 2014 and December 2016:(Click to enlarge)Shale oil which represented 70 percent of U.S. crude production on December 2014 (5.23M barrels) declined by 690K barrels, representing a 13 percent decline during that same time frame. U.S. shale oil production declined by 5.2 percent in the first year to 4.97M barrels (December 2015), and then declined by an additional 8.6 percent in the following year to 4.54M (December 2016).  Related: Venezuela: A Real Threat To Guyana's Oil BoomThe decline in U.S. shale oil stands in contrast to oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, which increased by 18 percent from 1.45M to 1.72M barrels during the same period due to the long-lead nature of the offshore production:(Click to enlarge)The same applies to non-OPEC production ex-U.S., with production remaining flat between Dec 2014 and Dec 2016 at around 43.5M barrels:(Click to enlarge)Please note the production swoon in May 2016 to 42.5M was mainly due to unplanned outages in Canada due to forest fires, and is not related to oil prices.As can be seen, both GOM and Non-OPEC (ex-U.S.) crude production were non-responsive to changes in oil prices. This is not to say these basins won’t respond to low oil prices - eventually, they will - but with a lag that could take between 3 and 5 years. We should see the impact of these declines by 2020 at the latest.U.S. shale oil dynamics It is clear that U.S. shale oil production is the most responsive free market oil to changes in oil prices. As U.S. shale oil production comes to represent a bigger piece of the pie in the global oil supply picture, its elastic characteristics will increasingly have a major impact on the global oil market. But before going into that let's take a closer look at the numbers (EIA data).     In December 2014, U.S. shale oil production stood at 5.23M barrels, with a total monthly legacy decline rate of 300K barrels per month. The legacy decline rate is what U.S. shale producers must replace every month to keep production flat. Net U.S. shale oil production growth that month stood at 114K barrels, to achieve that growth 414K barrels were brought online, 72 percent of which went to compensate for legacy declines. Today U.S. shale oil production stands at 8.03M barrels, with a total monthly decline rate of 530K barrels. U.S. shale producers increased production by 114K barrels in December 2018; to achieve this, new production came in at 644K barrels, 82 percent of which went to compensate for legacy declines. This last point is key: with 82 percent of U.S. shale oil production going to replace declines (as compared to 72 percent in 2014), means only 18 percent of new U.S. shale oil production is contributing to the net growth in U.S. supply.Related: Low Oil Prices Could Cripple Texas Job GrowthFollowing the experience of 2015/2016, most market observers agree that U.S. shale production can’t grow meaningfully with WTI under $50 a barrel, WTI averaged under $50 both in 2015 ($48) and 2016 ($43). Thus, with WTI trading under $50 WTI today, it's fair to assume that U.S. shale growth will either slow in the coming months, or contract should prices remain here. As indicated earlier, U.S. shale oil production today is much larger, and with a much bigger legacy decline rate than in 2014; this means that a slight decrease in activity could have an outsized impact on total U.S. production. To illustrate this point, we can proceed with a theoretical example, if we were to assume the slowdown in U.S. shale activity was to slow new production growth from 644K barrels per month to 580K by the end of Q1/2019, the net annualized growth in U.S. production would decrease from roughly 1.3m barrels per year to 600K per year or a 54 percent decline. Obviously, the numbers are not static, the underlying legacy decline rate will eventually slow down as new production slows down, but directionally the example is very telling. Furthermore, to put such U.S. decline in context, a slowdown of 50 percent in U.S. production growth would wipe out 51 percent of the expected 1.5m non-OPEC production growth projected for next year (IEA OMR December 2018).What’s important to keep in mind is that as U.S. production grows, and as legacy declines continue to cannibalize a larger portion of new U.S. shale oil production, U.S. production becomes increasingly sensitive to slight changes in drilling and completion activity. Those relatively small changes can have major implications for global oil balances. This situation is unprecedented in the history of the oil market for no global oil supply source has ever matched the sharp decline rate associated with U.S. shale oil production.     Long-Term ImplicationsAs we have seen from the above, U.S. shale oil is highly responsive to changes in oil prices, this, in turn, introduces a new balancing force in the global oil market, a force that acts as a floor should prices decline under $50 a barrel (the economic threshold to produce shale oil). This same force also acts as a ceiling should prices rise above $70 WTI, with most shale fields becoming profitable at that price point.Contrary to conventional wisdom, the implications of the shale phenomenon are quite positive for non-shale oil companies. Its true that U.S. shale oil introduces an upper band to oil prices, however, this is not a negative since sharp spikes in oil prices are generally harmful for the global economy and for oil demand growth; this is especially the case in an age where electrified transportation is gaining market share. Most importantly, U.S. shale oil’s reactivity to price declines represents an economic floor to oil prices that will supplement OPEC efforts to balance the oil market: barring OPEC, oil prices could decline to extreme levels, exactly as happened in early 2016, with WTI trading as low as $26 a barrel with OPEC opting to stand still. Having a free market oil price stabilizing force as described is a boon for conventional producers, many of whom can generate strong returns within the $50-$70 shale oil price band. Prior to the arrival of U.S. shale oil, OPEC was the oil market only security lever, today U.S. shale oil present another lever. This added downside protection underpins non-shale operators’ cash flows during the lower leg of the cycle. As capital markets gain confidence in non-shale operators cash flows at the trough, the most dangerous part of the commodity cycle, valuations in the non-shale oil sector should increase, rather than decrease as they have been of late due to a fundamental misunderstanding regarding the balancing role of U.S. shale in the oil market.     Longer term, U.S. shale oil’s upper band will cease to be a factor as U.S. shale oil production plateaus in the 9/10m barrels range in the early 2020s. In that ideal scenario, shale oil will continue to be a downside balancing force while losing its ability to cap the market on the upside due to logistical and geological constraints. Having U.S. shale oil downside protection without having it flood the market on the upside is a magnificent gift to OPEC, and other conventional oil producers. By Nawar Alsaadi for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-New-Oil-Order.html,"Dec 31, 2018 at 12:05 | Nawar Alsaadi","Dec 31, 2018",The New Oil Order
2018-12-31,"Oil markets have always been cyclical, and now even more so with advanced electronic trading, more speculation (which often results in wider oil price swings) and more producers, including the resurgence of U.S. oil production, now reaching over 11 million barrels per day. Added to the cocktail of uncertainty are also a myriad of geopolitical and economic factors, including ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions, angst of U.S. Federal Reserve policy, and wars in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere, which make it increasingly difficult to forecast the direction for future oil prices.This dynamic has proven true over the past two-and-a-half months as market pundits have watched (often in amazement) how global oil prices reached multi-year highs in October, only to quickly plunge by 40 percent to date. Prices for global oil benchmark, London-traded Brent crude futures were trading in the mid-$80’s range in early October, while U.S. oil benchmark, NYMEX-traded West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were hovering in the mid $70’s-range, a comfortable price point for U.S. shale oil producers, and around $25per barrel above the average oil production break-even point for shale producers.However, amid all of the dismal economic news and problematic geopolitical developments, a group of bankers are sounding optimistic once again over future oil price forecasts. On Friday, Bloomberg said that many of the world’s largest banks are forecasting a rebound in oil prices next year as fears of a recession prove misplaced.According to a Bloomberg survey of oil analysts, Brent will average $70 a barrel in 2019, almost a third higher than its price on Thursday. Michael Cohen, head of energy and commodities research at Barclays Plc in New York, said “we could even see something similar to a V-shaped recovery next year, on two very important conditions. One, that the reduction in OPEC exports leads to a reduction in inventories. And two, that we don’t see a further deterioration in macroeconomic conditions.”The Bloomberg report added that despite a recent darkening outlook for the global economy amid prolonged trade disputes between the U.S. and China, and as the U.S. Federal Reserve embarks on tightening monetary policy, most commentators aren’t seeing an actual recession biting the oil market next year. The median forecast of 24 oil analysts in the Bloomberg survey projects that Brent crude futures will average exactly $70 a barrel in 2019. The price on Thursday was about $53.50 while the average so far in 2018 has been about $72. Meanwhile, the median forecast for WTI is $61.13. WTI futures traded at about $45.27 on Monday.  Related: Low Oil Prices Could Cripple Texas Job GrowthMichael Tran, a commodities strategist at RBC Capital Markets LLC, said that prices are nearing a bottom, while ““global supply and demand should reach a fine balance next year.” Bloomberg added that in the absence of a severe economic slump, most analysts anticipate that world oil consumption will continue to expand at roughly the pace seen in recent years, powered by emerging economies such as China.Downplaying the trade war variable?However, though the analysts surveyed by Bloomberg give credence to ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, it appears that unless a new trade deal is reached by the self-imposed March 2 deadline between the two sides, global oil demand will indeed recede amid more sluggish global economic growth, led by a slow down in Chinese manufacturing and exports. Since the U.S. and China are the world’s two largest economies, ongoing trade tensions are already hitting global supply chains, particularly in Asia. Numerous manufacturing companies have already exited China for greener pastures, including setting up shop in neighboring Southeast Asian economic tiger Vietnam.Japan, the world’s third largest economy and a major importer of both crude oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG), for its part, is already suffering economic fall out from the U.S.-China trade spate. In September, the Tokyo-based Nikkei Asian Review said that at least 60 percent of top Japanese companies expected earnings to be hurt by the trade war. If Washington and Beijing can’t reach a formal trade war cease-fire by March 2, that 60 percent figure could likely include nearly all top Japanese companies, while Japan’s GDP would also take a hit, as would oil demand growth in the country.A protracted trade war between the U.S. and China will also hit other OECD members. Last month, the group of developed economies downgraded its global growth forecast from 3.7 percent to 3.5 percent in 2019 and 2020. However, that growth forecast could likely be readjusted if the U.S. hikes existing tariffs on $200 bn worth of Chinese products to as high as 25 percent while slapping fresh duties on another $267 bn worth of Chinese exports would exacerbate the problem.By Tim Daiss for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/70-Oil-Could-Be-Right-Around-The-Corner.html,"Dec 31, 2018 at 11:32 | Tim Daiss","Dec 31, 2018",$70 Oil Could Be Right Around The Corner
2018-12-31,"The explosive growth of U.S. shale production has capped gains of international and U.S. oil prices, offsetting OPEC’s production cuts in the first half of the year and contributing to an emerging oil glut in the latter half in 2018.  OPEC has now forged a new pact with its Russia-led non-OPEC allies to contain the oil price decline to $50 a barrel Brent—a price that is not enough to balance any budget of a Middle Eastern oil producer.But the consequences of rising U.S. light oil production from the shale fields have also rippled through international oil flows and trade, making OPEC’s heavyweights such as Saudi Arabia fight for keeping market share in their most prized market and the world’s fastest-growing oil consumption region, Asia.Thanks to the booming shale production, U.S. light oil exports have increased, taking market shares out of the lighter grades that Saudi Arabia and its fellow OPEC members are exporting to Asia.Moreover, increased crude oil production in the U.S. has also resulted in higher oil product exports which, combined with higher Chinese refined product exports, have created an oversupply of products in Asia, crashing refining margins earlier in December.U.S. crude oil production has been breaking records in recent months, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Total U.S. petroleum exports have also been setting records over the past year, EIA data shows.U.S. light crude oil exports to Asia have also grown and even with China shunning American crude, U.S. sales to OPEC’s key market Asia have held relatively steady since August this year, according to data from Kpler compiled by Bloomberg.  Related: Low Oil Prices Could Cripple Texas Job GrowthAs OPEC is getting ready for another round of production cuts beginning January, Saudi Arabia for example is hell-bent on keeping its market share in Asia and has recently slashed the January prices of all its grades going to Asia, while it raised the prices for all grades bound for the U.S., Northwest Europe, and the Mediterranean. Saudi Aramco’s deepest cuts in Asian pricing were for the Super Light and Extra Light grades, slashed by US$2 and $1.50 a barrel from December’s prices, respectively. The official selling prices (OSPs) of Arab Light, Medium, and Heavy were also cut, by between $0.40 and $1.00 a barrel.The deepest cuts in the lighter grades reflect Saudi Arabia’s effort to keep its market share in Asia as competition from U.S. light oil intensifies, according to analysts.“Lights are [cut] very aggressively,” a sour crude oil trader told S&P Global Platts in early December, commenting on the Saudi pricing for Asia for January.“Guess they are trying to prevent too much US arb inflow,” the trader said.Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members also have to contend with increased refined product exports out of the U.S., as well as China, which are creating a glut of gasoline and naphtha, depressing refining margins in Asia.Related: ExxonMobil Faces Off With Venezuela’s NavyIn early December, the gasoline refining margin at the Singapore hub, viewed as a benchmark for Asia, slumped to a loss and to the lowest level against Brent prices since November 2011. Loss-making gasoline margins weighed on Asia’s overall refining profits, which hit in early December their lowest since August 2016, despite crumbling crude oil prices, according to data from Refinitiv Eikon, as carried by Reuters.China is reportedly raising its fuel export quota for 2019 by 13 percent, which could additionally weigh on product oversupply.According to data compiled by Bloomberg, this year average monthly U.S. exports to Asia of light distillates—including gasoline and naphtha—have been nearly triple the export levels over the past two years. The gasoline and other oil products glut comes just as OPEC and allies start the new production cuts of 1.2 million bpd. Faced with U.S. competition of lighter grades in Asia, OPEC and its largest producer Saudi Arabia are fighting hard for their market share in their prized export destination.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Shale-Challenges-OPECs-Oil-Dominance-In-Asia.html,"Dec 31, 2018 at 11:29 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Dec 31, 2018",U.S. Shale Challenges OPEC’s Oil Dominance In Asia
2018-12-31,"Canada’s drilling rig count fell by 61 rigs in the last week of December from a week earlier, with the annual decline at 66 rigs, per the latest weekly rig count report by Baker Hughes. As Canadian drillers gear up for winter season, the rig count usually drops before the end of the year, this year, the figures add a more grim shade to the landscape of the Canadian oil industry, which this year suffered a major slump of the local benchmark, Western Canadian Select, to West Texas Intermediate, at one time dipping to a discount of over US$50 to WTI.Over the last two weeks of the month and the year, according to the data, the number of active drilling rigs deployed in Canada fell by a combined 104 to just 70, highlighting the effect of low local oil prices but also the obligatory production cuts enforced by the Albertan government to arrest the slide in prices and clear excessive crude oil inventory.The production cut will begin at a rate of 325,000 bpd, to be reduced to 95,000 bpd once the excess supply is cleared, which is expected to happen within three months. Afterwards, the cuts will be in place until the end of next year.Not everyone in the local oil industry is thrilled with the production cut. Suncor was against it when the idea was first floated, proposed by the chief executive of peer Cenovus. Most large companies in the field, who also have processing capacity, are better placed to weather the effects of the lower prices as they refine their own crude oil. Premier Notley has also floated the idea of building a new refinery in Alberta that would absorb more of the oil that is produced in the province instead of shipping it to U.S. refiners at cut-throat rates.According to Canadian media reports from earlier this month, Albertan energy companies were interested in expanding the province’s processing capacity. Alberta has four refineries at present, with a combined refining capacity of 475,000 bpd. There are also two other specialized diesel-producing facilities that can refine 110,000 bpd of crude.A new refinery would indeed serve to stabilize prices of Canadian crude, but there is one problem: a refinery cannot be built in a month, even in a year. What’s more, some experts argue that Canada’s oil province already has too much refining capacity and the only solution to its price problem are more pipelines.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Canadian-Rig-Count-Slumps-At-Year-End.html,"Dec 31, 2018 at 10:30 | Irina Slav","Dec 31, 2018",Canadian Rig Count Slumps At Year-End
2018-12-28,"A day after the American Petroleum Institute pressured already stressed oil prices further with an unexpected inventory build, the Energy Information Administration reported instead that crude oil inventories were virtually unchanged for the week.At 441.4 million barrels, the inventories are within seasonal limits, the EIA said in its last weekly inventory report for the year.Refineries processed 17.4 million barrels of crude daily last week, producing 10.1million barrels daily of gasoline and 5.4 million bpd of distillate fuels. Inventories of gasoline added 3 million barrels at the end of the seven-day reporting period, and distillate fuel inventories staying unchanged.Crude oil, meanwhile, has been having an exciting week with sharp falls prompted by market-wide worries about an oversupply amid slowing global economic growth, followed by a partial rebound as traders took advantage of the low prices. As of the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at US$53.70 a barrel, up 1.84 percent from yesterday’s close, and West Texas Intermediate was changing hands for US$45.63 a barrel, up by as much as 2.29 percent.It seems nobody knows exactly which way prices would go within a space of a few hours right now, although it’s safe to say they would reflect stock market movements pretty accurately.“For the time being, the stock market and the oil market will echo each other,” a South Korean commodities analyst told Reuters today. “Global economic slowdown worries have been weighing on stock market movements, and oil prices are not free from those concerns.”Prices could begin to recover once OPEC cuts enter into effect in January although the effect may not be immediately apparent, unlike two years ago, when the first production cut agreement was struck. It looks like this time, the headwinds are stronger and a lot of positive economic data would be necessary to convince a worried market the global economy will need more oil.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/EIA-Inventory-Report-Stops-Price-Slide.html,"Dec 28, 2018 at 10:30 | Irina Slav","Dec 28, 2018",EIA Inventory Report Stops Price Slide
2018-12-26,"OPEC has come through some turbulent times in the last few years as oil prices fell to decade lows. It has implemented production cuts, has rallied Russia to climb onboard the production cut train, has weathered the rise of US shale to never-before-seen highs, has extended those production cuts, has lifted production to quell a nervous market post-Iranian sanctions, and then has managed to pull a rabbit out of a hat by agreeing to yet another production cut—and OPEC is not finished yet.As we approach the new year, the 15-member-strong OPEC is facing another set of challenges. Here are some of the challenges they will face in 2019:Manuel Quevedo: OPEC’s leadership is crucial to its success. It operates under a rotating presidency, and for 2019, that honor is bestowed upon none other than Venezuela’s Manuel Quevedo.Manuel Quevedo has zero oil industry experience, taking over Venezuela’s crisis-stricken PDVSA and oil minister of the nation (which is pretty much the same thing). Instead, Quevedo’s experience is with the military, serving as National Guard major general prior to his position as insta-oil czar in a country that is falling apart at the seams. Quevedo was appointed in late 2017 to right the wrong ship that is PDVSA—and was given extra powers—let’s call it a special dispensation—to “create, annul or modify” deals involving PDVSA its subsidiaries. His reign dispensed with nearly 70 PDVSA executives in a massive “anti-corruption” sweep that some have labeled a mere power grab, despite Maduro’s insistence to the contrary.Quevedo has been, so far, unable to right the ship, with Venezuela’s oil production and oil revenues falling at unprecedented rates, even when oil prices rallied mid-year. Quevedo has instead instilled fear into PDVSA workers and has implemented some policies that some argue have brought PDVSA closer to—not further from—the brink of ruin.A Maduro loyalist through and through, Quevedo will now take over not only PDVSA and Venezuela’s oil industry, but will assume the rotating presidency of the most influential oil industry body in the world. But his lack of experience is only part of the trouble. OPEC has been the target of Tweets by US President Donald Trump—add to that President Trump’s vehement opposition to Maduro—the subject of US sanctions—and OPEC may find itself even more of a target. The worst thing for OPEC would be for Venezuela’s tenuous relationship with Washington to mar OPEC’s already tenuous relationship with Washington.Related: UBS: Expect $80 Brent Next YearQuevedo is also strongly backing El Petro—its alleged oil-backed cryptocurrency—and has supposedly been invited by OPEC to speak about the rise of El Petro sometime in 2019.NOPEC: Another hurdle OPEC faces in 2019 is the proposed US legislation that would allow legal claims against OPEC for manipulating oil prices, called the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act (NOPEC) In mid-2018, OPEC advised its members to stop referring to oil prices specifically, instead urging them to use phrases such as “balanced market” and the like. OPEC’s preemptive strike speaks to the plausibility that this legislation could be passed, as President Donald Trump’s strained relationship with OPEC plays out on Twitter and in the legislative branch.Qatar walked out of OPEC just one month ago, potentially distancing itself from this legislation that if passed, would open up a whole can of legal issues for the cartel as it would end anti-trust laws, revoking the sovereign immunity that until now has protected OPEC members from legal actions regarding price fixing.Libya: Libya managed to secure an exemption from the OPEC production cuts that will go into effect on January 1, 2019, allegedly due to its unstable oil production that ebbs and flows as infighting continues to batter its oil industry like a plague. But this exemption, and its chronic outages of its largest oilfield, Sharara, poses a challenge to OPEC, who is struggling to balance production with demand. As Libya’s production increases and decreases, OPEC has difficulty responding immediately to offset the ebbs and flows, and no single country has been fingered—at least not to our knowledge—to increase or decrease production to offset Libya’s production. The unknowns with Libya create an unknown for all of OPEC.Russia, et al: The non-OPEC signees of the deal to cut production expose OPEC to a greater risk. OPEC needs heavyweight Russia on board with the production cuts. Russia has agreed to cut production, along with several other lesser non-OPEC producers. But it has also said that it will be a gradual production cut, beginning in January but not reaching full cut volumes until March. Here, Russia holds some sway, exacerbated by its cozy relationship with Venezuela and major general Quevedo, who has been the recipient of substantial loans courtesy of Russia’s generosity. OPEC has recruited Russia out of necessity, and being in bed with Russia exposes OPEC to greater risks. Should Russia renege on the deal with OPEC, the production cut agreement would be largely toothless.  Related: Canada’s LNG Dream Just Turned Into A NightmareSpeculators: Oil prices still respond to OPEC chatter, leaked information, statements to the press, and monthly production figures that either show OPEC’s success in hitting professed production targets. But the latter half of 2018 saw the beginning of a partial immunity to such news, and as the oil market continues its recently acquired anxiety disorder, 2019 is unlikely to look much different.  What OPEC could previously achieve with a mere promise to curb production (or increase production), will now be met with increasing apathy—show, don’t tell will be the new norm for the oil market as traders work against OPEC, albeit unconsciously.US Shale: The United States shale industry has been a thorn in OPEC’s side since the cartel’s initial “pump oil until we crush them” policy rolled out prior to its first round of production cuts in 2017. The rise of US shale will continue to be so throughout 2019 as production increases continue unabated. Unlike OPEC members, US shale producers are only inhibited by price, and even that has proven to be a nondeterrent to increasing production. For every barrel that OPEC doesn’t produce, oil producers in the United States will happily export in its stead. The United States’ entry as top dog when it comes to oil production at 11.7 million bpd toward the end of 2018 has taken much wind out of OPEC’s sails, making it more difficult for OPEC to manipulate the market. This will continue throughout 2019.OPEC will have an uphill battle in 2019, but its influence as a cartel should not be dismissed entirely. The oil market in 2019 will be largely affected by OPEC—just not single-handedly by OPEC as other major players rise to sway the market as well.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Whats-In-Store-For-OPEC-In-2019.html,"Dec 26, 2018 at 10:10 | Julianne Geiger","Dec 26, 2018",What’s In Store For OPEC In 2019?
2018-12-24,"In 2013, I began warning about the risk to oil prices due to the ongoing imbalances between global supply and demand. Those warnings fell on deaf ears as it was believed that “oil prices could only go higher from here.”It didn’t take long for those predictions to play out. In May of 2014, I wrote:“While it is likely oil prices could get a bit of a bump from a decline in the U.S. dollar, ultimately it will come down to the fundamentals longer term. It is quite clear that the speculative rise in oil prices due to the ‘fracking miracle’ has come to its inglorious but expected conclusion…It is quite apparent that some lessons are simply never learned. “Of course, as with all things, particularly when it comes to commodities, it doesn’t take long for speculation to once again grab hold and drive prices higher in the short-term despite the long-term fundamental problems which still exist.In September of 2017, I wrote a piece reviewing those fundamentals.“I have been getting a tremendous number of emails as of late asking if the latest rally in oil prices, and related energy stocks, is sustainable or is it another ‘trap’ as has been witnessed previously.As regular readers know, we exited oil and gas stocks back in mid-2014 and have remained out of the sector for technical and fundamental reasons for the duration. While there have been some opportunistic trading setups, the technical backdrop has remained decidedly bearish.”The conclusion was not what most were hoping for.“While there is hope the production cuts will continue into 2018, a bulk of the current price gain has likely already been priced in. With oil prices once again overbought on a monthly basis, the risk of disappointment is substantial.”Well, here we are wrapping up 2018 and the prices of both energy-related shares and oil have been disappointing.The expected decline in oil prices is more important than just the relative decline in share prices of energy-related stocks. As I wrote previously, energy prices are highly correlated to economic activity. To wit:“Oil is a highly sensitive indicator relative to the expansion or contraction of the economy. Given that oil is consumed in virtually every aspect of our lives, from the food we eat to the products and services we buy, the demand side of the equation is a tell-tale sign of economic strength or weakness.  Related: UBS: Expect $80 Brent Next YearThe chart below combines interest rates, inflation, and GDP into one composite indicator to provide a clearer comparison to oil prices. One important note is that oil tends to trade along a pretty defined trend…until it doesn’t. Given that the oil industry is very manufacturing and production intensive, breaks of price trends tend to be liquidation events which have a negative impact on the manufacturing and CapEx spending inputs into the GDP calculation.”(Click to enlarge) “As such, it is not surprising that sharp declines in oil prices have been coincident with downturns in economic activity, a drop in inflation, and a subsequent decline in interest rates.”Since then, the price of oil has declined further as economic weakness continues to gain traction globally. Despite the occasional rally, it’s hard to see the outlook for oil is encouraging on both fundamental and technical levels. The charts for WTI remain bearish, while the fundamentals remain basically “Economics 101: too much supply, too little demand.” The parallel with 2014 is there if you want to see it.(Click to enlarge) The current levels of supply potentially create a longer-term issue for prices globally particularly in the face of weaker global demand due to demographics, energy efficiencies, and debt.Many point to the 2008 commodity crash as THE example as to why oil prices are destined to rise in the near term. The clear issue remains supply as it relates to the price of any commodity. With drilling in the Permian Basin expanding currently, any “cuts” by OPEC have already been offset by increased domestic production. As I stated previously, any rise in oil prices beyond $55/bbl would likely make the OPEC “cuts” very short-lived which indeed turned out to be the case. As noted in the chart above, the difference between 2008 and today is that previously the world was fearful of “running out” of oil versus worries about an “oil glut” today. The issues of supply versus price become clearer if we look further back in history to the last crash in commodity prices which marked an extremely long period of oil price suppression as supply was reduced.(Click to enlarge) The problem with the recent surge in oil prices was that it was being driven by speculative excess. As I noted in “Everyone Is On The Same Side Of The Boat:”“Of course, the cycle of rising oil prices leading to increased optimism which begets bullish bets on oil continues to press prices higher. However, it is also the exuberance which has repeatedly set up the next fall. As shown below, bets on crude oil prices are sitting near the highest levels on record and substantially higher than what was seen at the peak of oil prices prior to 2008 and 2014.”(Click to enlarge) When I wrote that in May of this year (2018), it received a lot of criticism about my misunderstanding of global demand and explanations of why oil prices could only go higher.It didn’t take long for reality to take hold.The Headwinds For Oil RemainIn 2008, when prices crashed, the supply of into the marketplace had hit an all-time low while global demand was at an all-time high. Remember, the fears of “peak oil” was rampant in news headlines and in the financial markets. Of course, the financial crisis took hold and quickly realigned prices with demand.(Click to enlarge) Of course, the supply-demand imbalance, combined with suppressed commodity prices in 2008, was the perfect cocktail for a surge in prices as the “fracking miracle” came into focus. The surge of supply alleviated the fears of oil company stability and investors rushed back into energy-related companies to “feast” on the buffet of accelerating profitability into the infinite future.The problem currently, and as of yet not fully recognized, is the supply-demand imbalance has once again reverted. With supply now at the highest levels on record, and global demand growth weak due to a rolling debt-cycle driven global deflationary cycle, the dynamics for a repeat of the pre-2008 surge in prices is unlikely.(Click to enlarge) The supply-demand problem is not likely to be resolved over the course of a few months either. The current dynamics of the financial markets, global economies, and the current level of supply is more akin to that of the early-1980’s. Even if OPEC does continue to reduce output, it will continue to be insufficient to offset the increases from shale field production.(Click to enlarge) Since oil production, at any price, is the major part of the revenue streams of energy-related companies, it is unlikely they will dramatically gut their production in the short-term. The important backdrop is extraction from shale continues to become cheaper and more efficient all the time. In turn, this lowers the price point where production becomes profitable increases the supply coming to market.Then there is the demand side of the equation.  Related: $50 Oil Won’t Kill U.S. ShaleFor example, my friend Jill Mislinski discussed the issue of a weak economic backdrop.“There are profound behavioral issues apart from gasoline prices that are influencing miles traveled. These would include the demographics of an aging population in which older people drive less, continuing high unemployment, the ever-growing ability to work remote in the era of the Internet and the use of ever-growing communication technologies as a partial substitute for face-to-face interaction.”(Click to enlarge) The problem with dropping demand, of course, is the potential for the creation of a “supply glut” that leads to a continued suppression in oil prices.The headwinds to higher oil prices from the demand side come in a variety of forms:• Weak economic global growth over the last decade which will remain weak going forward• Slow and steady growth of renewable/alternative sources of energy• Technological improvements in energy production, storage and transfer, and;• A rapidly aging global demographicAdd to those issues that over the next few years EVERY major auto supplier will be continuously rolling out more efficient automobiles including larger offerings of hybrid and fully electric vehicles.All this boils down to a long-term, secular, and structurally bearish story.With respect to investors, the argument can be made that oil prices have likely found a long-term bottom in the $40 range. However, the fundamental tailwinds for substantially higher prices are still vacant. OPEC won’t keep cutting production forever, the global economy remains weak, efficiencies are suppressing demand.Furthermore, given the length of the current economic expansion, the onset of the next recession is likely closer than not. A recession will negatively impact oil prices (which are driven by commodity traders) and energy investments as the proverbial “baby is thrown out with the bathwater.”This is where we will be looking for long-term bargains in the space.By Real Investment AdviceMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Why-The-Oil-Price-Bear-Market-Persists.html,"Dec 24, 2018 at 12:47 | Lance Roberts","Dec 24, 2018",Why The Oil Price Bear Market Persists
2018-12-24,"This year has been a crazy ride for the oil industry, which saw the price of Brent crude seesaw from $66.87 on the first day of the year, to a high of $86.29 in early October, back to $66.28 in mid-November—almost precisely back to where we started—and then closing out the year right before Christmas at a disappointing $54.10.Yes, typical catalysts such as inventory and capacity affect oil prices; they always have. But there were other forces at play in 2018 that significantly influenced the price of oil in 2018, and here is our list of those important individuals in 2018, and those to watch for 2019.Fatih Birol – As head of the International Energy Agency (IEA), Dr. Fatih Birol has made several lists in years past of influential oil figures. While he doesn’t directly control production, inventory, prices, or policy, his words—usually regarding oil demand or production forecasts. In late 2018, the head of the IEA went further than offering gloomy oil demand figures for the coming year, issuing warnings to the world’s largest oil producers, urging them not to cut oil output, and warning the market that the higher oil prices heading into November were such that it was already high enough to dent demand.“Currently markets are very well supplied but we should not forget that spare capacity in Saudi Arabia is very thin, therefore cutting the production significantly today by key oil producers may have some negative implications for the markets and further tightening the markets…My appeal to all producers and consumers across the world is to have common sense in these difficult days.”—Fatih Birol, November 2018Oil prices had already started to slide leading up to Dr. Birol’s plea but had rallied somewhat the four days prior. Brent stood at $66.79 on November 19 but fell sharply to $62.53 by the next day as speculators latched onto fear that oil demand might falter.Mohammed bin Salman – Essentially the ruler of the heavyweight oil producer Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman has exerted unofficial—but significant—influence over the oil markets. His pursuit of the war in Yemen, his push for a blockade of neighboring Qatar, his attempt to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil (Vision 2030), his massive “corruption” crackdown that helped to solidify his power, and implementing a trade row with Canada. His single biggest influence in 2018 was likely his push to extend OPEC’s production cuts—achieved largely through his deepening relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin—as higher prices are the only way MbS can reap higher oil prices, which is the only path toward continuing his costly modernization plans for The Kingdom.  Related: OPEC+ Deal Not Enough To Save The Oil Market“We are working to shift from a year-to-year agreement to a 10 to 20-year agreement.” – Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, March 2018Khalid A. Al-Falih – If MbS is the string-puller of the Saudi oil world, Al-Falih is the implementer—and often a more visible one at that. It is precisely that visibility which gives Al-Falih the power to sway oil prices. As Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, Al-Falih has often been touted as the world’s largest influencer in the oil markets today. While we are not committed to giving him that crown this year, Al-Falih is certainly in the top five influencers. His mere words to the press are quoted, tweeted, cited, and hung on by every single oil trader in the world. And like MbS, his ties to Russia, which went a long way towards rallying Russia to join in the OPEC cut extension in June, and OPEC cuts 2.0 in November, which will start in 2019. Further, Saudi Arabia, under Al-Falih’s guidance, curtailed oil exports to the United States in an effort to manipulate oil inventories in the US—and thus influence the price of oil indirectly by changing the most watched and most transparent oil metric in the world—US inventories as reported by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the American Petroleum Institute (API). Like others on this list, such as Alexander Novak and President Donald Trump, Al-Falih’s power comes mostly from his reputation—and his words have sway absent even of any real policy change or action. His power also comes largely from Aramco’s professed ability to turn on and off its taps to manipulate oil’s fundamentals on a large scale.“We will meet any demand that materializes.” Al-Falih October 2018President Donald Trump – Here is the newest player on the world’s most prominent catalyst for oil price swings. For better or for worse, love him or hate him, President Donald Trump has undeniably changed the course of the oil industry in 2018, and not just in the United States. His late-night Tweets has sent oil prices falling, has sent OPEC scrambling, and has sent Saudi Arabia a different tune to sing.Some may staunchly deny that President Trump has any real power to change oil prices, but his policy changes—from the biofuel mandate, opening up offshore drilling, his sanctions on Iran that went into effect in November, and the waivers he allowed to some of the world’s thirstiest oil consumers—have had a profound effect not just on market sentiment, but on oil’s fundamentals as well. But perhaps his single largest influence on the oil market as his oil-related tweets, which have in 2018 caught the eye of every speculator. His tweets, particularly those that chastised OPEC for restricting output and thus manipulating oil prices, have had a significant and even immediate effect on prices.“Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!” – President Donald Trump, Twitter, December 2018 on eve of OPEC meeting.Nicolas Maduro – With Venezuela now definitively in shambles, Nicolas Maduro still seems bent on steering his shipwreck of a country right off a colossal waterfall, and its entire oil industry along with it. Because the country is home to the largest oil reserves in the world, the fate of its oil industry impacts in a profound way, the entire oil industry. Maduro’s clanging cymbal of promised change has done little to allay fears that its lost production will translate into a shortage of oil elsewhere, but Venezuela’s rapidly declining production, thanks in large part to Maduro’s mismanagement and plundering of PDVSA, has bolstered oil prices by tightening supply, and has provided some relief to OPEC as they struggled throughout 2018 to meet stringent production cut quotas. Despite Maduro’s insistence that it will start to trade oil its new currency, El Petro, little has come of his grand scheme.General Khalifa Haftar (aka Gaddafi 2.0) – 2018 has been a year of fear that major oil producers such as Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United States would not be able to compensate for production losses elsewhere, such as Iran, Venezuela, and Libya. Granted a waiver from the original production cut agreement that OPEC hashed in late 2017, Libya was watched for much of early 2018 as the troubled country’s oil production ebbed and flowed thanks to infighting that was kept in check, for the most part, singlehandedly by General Khalifa Haftar.Vladimir Putin – While Igor Sechin may be head of Russian oil giant Rosneft, Putin is unquestionably in control of the country’s oil policies and production. Sechin is no puppet, for sure, but is still dwarfed by Putin’s larger-than-life persona. From deals with Saudi Arabia and OPEC to curb production—the single most meaningful metric that moved markets this year—to Turkish Stream and anti-Trump quotes, Putin is decidedly affecting oil prices. Along with Al-Khalid and President Donald Trump, Putin’s quotes in the media have sway.  Related: UBS: Expect $80 Brent Next Year“President Trump has said he thinks the oil price is too high. Well, probably to some extent he’s right ... But let’s be frank, such oil prices are to some extent the result of the U.S. administration,” Vladimir Putin, October 2018.Igor Sechin – Known to some as the Darth Vader of Russia, and arguably the second most influential man in Russia after Putin, Sechin has dispensed with his competition when it suited him to do so (Bashneft, Yukos). With this history in mind, Sechin leads and others follow. Some in Russia might consider Sechin a more powerful figure than Putin and claim that Rosneft’s rise is attributed to Sechin’s ruthless actions.Elon Musk – Musk perhaps would shudder to find himself on a list of prominent oilmen, but this year’s list of powerful oilmen would not be complete without at least mentioning Musk’s significant impact on the oil industry. His quest to put EVs in the forefront of the world’s mind has without question pushed other auto manufacturers to develop EVs of their own, and at a quickened pace than what would otherwise have been. This push to get more EVs on the road, and the desire of other manufacturers to not be left behind, has sparked concern in the oil industry that its days are numbered.Honorable MentionsThe last three on our list are honorable mentions, but their influence should not be downplayed. Their policies have undoubtedly affected the markets, but perhaps with not as much fanfare as those in our list above.Xi Jinping – China is at the heart of the world’s oil demand, and Xi Jinping’s decision mid-June to not issue any more solar power installations tariffs, and to cut the feed-in tariff subsidy has affected oil demand in the country, by shifting its energy demand away from solar and towards oil and natural gas.Trudeau – Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau created nearly single-handedly a disaster of monumental proportions in Canada’s oil industry, by not backing pipeline expansion with enough force. This lack of support indirectly created the largest discount ever in Western Canadian Select to West Texas Intermediate, as pipeline constraints restricted the flow of WCS to US refiners as anti-oil British Columbia and oil powerhouse Alberta duked it out with trade wars of their own.Alexander Novak – This is our third Russian on the list, and his power as Russia’s Energy Minister mostly consists of words spoken to the press. His alleged bromance with Saudi counterpart Khalid Al-Falih that helped to solidify cooperation between two of the three largest oil producers in the world has led to an alliance that is one for the history books. As Russia allied with OPEC in the production cuts, Novak helped to create an entity that could swing prices by manipulating the world’s oil supply. Without Russia, OPEC’s power to manipulate would be severely diminished, and some would argue ineffective.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Biggest-Oilmen-Of-2018.html,"Dec 24, 2018 at 11:44 | Julianne Geiger","Dec 24, 2018",The Biggest Oilmen Of 2018
2018-12-21,"If the goal of the OPEC+ cuts was to boost oil prices, then the deal is clearly failing.OPEC+ is scrambling to figure out a way to rescue oil prices from another deep downturn. WTI is now down into the mid-$40s and Brent into the mid-$50s, both a 15-month low. U.S. shale continues to soar, even if shale producers themselves are now facing financial trouble with prices so low. Oil traders are clearly skeptical that OPEC+ is either willing or capable of balancing the oil market.OPEC+ thought they secured a strong deal in Vienna in early December, but more needs to be done, it seems. OPEC’s Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo wrote a letter to the cartel’s members, arguing that they need to increase the cuts. Initially, the OPEC+ coalition suggested that producers should lower output by 2.5 percent, but Barkindo said that the cuts need to be more like 3 percent in order to reach the overall 1.2 million-barrel-per-day reduction.More importantly, the group needs to detail how much each country should be producing. “In the interests of openness and transparency, and to support market sentiment and confidence, it is vital to make these production adjustments publicly available,” Barkindo told members in the letter, according to Reuters. By specifying exactly how much each country will reduce, the thinking seems to be, it will go a long way to assuaging market anxiety about the group’s seriousness.Still, the plunge in oil prices this month is evidence that traders are not convinced. The view is “that the U.S. will continue to grow like gangbusters regardless of price and overwhelm any OPEC action,” Helima Croft, the chief commodities strategist at Canadian broker RBC, told the Wall Street Journal. “Unless there is a real geopolitical blowup, it could take time for these cuts to really shift sentiment.”  Related: Interest Rate Hike Hits Oil HardWhile cuts from producers like Saudi Arabia will help take supply off of the market, OPEC might help erase the surplus in another unintended way. Bloomberg raises the possibility that low oil prices could increase turmoil in some OPEC member states. The price meltdown between 2014 and 2016 led to, or at least exacerbated, outages in Libya, Venezuela and Nigeria. The same could happen again.Just about all OPEC members need much higher oil prices in order to balance their books. Saudi Arabia needs roughly $88 per barrel for its budget to breakeven. Libya needs $114. Nigeria needs $127. Venezuela needs a whopping $216. Only Kuwait – at $48 per barrel – can balance its books at prevailing prices. Brent is trading in the mid-$50s right now.That raises the prospect of more unrest. Venezuela’s supply losses are assured – and largely already factored into market forecasts – although the rate of decline remains uncertain. But further unexpected outages are possible, and become more likely with lower prices. Libya and Nigeria are the most likely sources of instability. Unexpected disruptions in supply in 2019 could tighten up the market.Still, while there are many problems facing OPEC+ as it seeks to balance the market, one important factor lies mostly out of the group’s control. Much of the OPEC+ discussion focuses on supply-side dynamics – how much the group should be producing in order to achieve some price target. But the problems sweeping over the oil market right now could be even larger.Specifically, a global economic slowdown could translate into much slower demand, a problem that OPEC+ cannot fix. Sinking oil prices isn’t just a matter of market expectations of oversupply from U.S. shale.   The financial turmoil and brewing economic slowdown is clearly overwhelming the OPEC+ cuts, as well as the jawboning that some OPEC officials have tried over the past week. Stock markets plunged in recent days after the Federal Reserve tightened interest rates yet again and signaled two more rate hikes in 2019.There haven’t yet been any dramatic revisions to 2019 oil demand from leading energy forecasters, such as the EIA or IEA. But, then again, the financial instability and the souring oil market have only cropped up recently. The IEA has maintained a 1.4-mb/d growth rate for demand next year, but take that with a grain of salt. Demand revisions could be forthcoming. OPEC+ may have to keep its supply curbs in place for the full year in 2019, but it’s unclear if even that can push prices back up to where they were two months ago.By Nick Cunningham, Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/OPEC-Deal-Not-Enough-To-Save-The-Oil-Market.html,"Dec 21, 2018 at 17:26 | Nick Cunningham","Dec 21, 2018",OPEC+ Deal Not Enough To Save The Oil Market
2018-12-21,"Russia continues to be the key partner of OPEC and its largest producer Saudi Arabia in managing the oil market. For a second production cut deal in a row, Moscow joined the cartel’s cuts, taking the lion’s share of the cuts intended for the non-OPEC members of the pact.For a second production cut in row, Russia will be gradually reducing output and could reach its share of cuts by the end of the first quarter, its Energy Minister Alexander Novak said this week.Russia’s oil production will be cut from the October baseline, which was a new post-Soviet record high of 11.41 million bpd. Between May and October this year, Russia had reversed its entire 300,000-bpd cut that was pledged as part of the initial deal and added even more on top of that, as Moscow, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Kuwait pumped more oil to offset what was expected to be a steep drop in Iranian oil supply due to the U.S. sanctions.The production cuts may have postponed plans of some Russian oil companies to boost output, but the reductions and ramp-up in a few months have shown Russia’s capability to play the role of a key global swing producer, second only to Saudi Arabia, according to analysts at S&P Global Platts.“Russia’s rapid production growth from May through October demonstrated its ability to be a key swing producer, at a level below that of Saudi Arabia but as high as any other country in the world,” S&P Global Platts Analytics’ Paul Sheldon says.While several of the non-OPEC nations will largely rely on natural decline—take Mexico for example—Russia will be purposefully cutting 228,000 bpd between January and June 2019, more than half of non-OPEC’s 400,000-bpd total reduction pledge.Although the new OPEC+ production cut deal is currently for a six-month period with an option to review in April, and it’s not certain how long these cuts will actually last, Russia’s production could continue to surprise on the upside after the cuts expire, Platts Analytics says, contrary to the gloomy scenarios proposed by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Russia’s own energy ministry.Russia’s oil production could peak as early as in 2021 due to high taxes and costs, provided there are no benefits for exploration or tax incentives introduced, Novak said in September this year. By 2021, Russia’s oil production will rise to 570 million tons, which, without more benefits and lower taxes, could be the peak oil production, Novak warned.  Related: Interest Rate Hike Hits Oil HardIf current production trends continue, and if Russia doesn’t do anything to further stimulate oil exploration and new field development, after 2021, production may start to fall and reach just 310 million tons by 2035, that is, Russia’s oil production could drop by 44 percent by then, according to the energy minister.Due to the OPEC+ production cuts, Russia’s crude oil production in 2019 could be lower than originally planned—at 552 million tons, or 11.085 million bpd, Novak said this week.According to Novak, plans for next year were for Russia’s oil production to stand at 555 million tons-556 million tons, or 11.145 million bpd-11.165 million bpd, but a lot will depend on Russia’s oil production policy after the first half of 2019.The IEA, for its part, sees a possible decline after 2020, “if Russian companies are unable to secure the technology and financing necessary for the next generation of projects and the government fails to offer more extensive tax breaks to encourage investment.”Yet, Platts Analytics’ Sheldon begs to differ:“We take any doomsday scenarios with a grain of salt. Betting on any decline in Russian production has been a losing proposition since 1999.”  Related: Major LNG Shortage Increasingly LikelyRussia’s huge reserves, growing technological capabilities of domestic companies, and an eventual removal of the Western sanctions could also help Russian oil production “at some point down the road,” Sheldon says. According to Platts Analytics, Russia’s oil production will be in the 11.3 million bpd-11.4 million bpd range between 2027 and 2040.To stimulate production and development of oil fields, Russia is also overhauling its complex taxation system for the oil industry—currently some of the most burdensome oil taxes in the world. Moscow will test in 2019 a new profit-based tax for several types of oil fields, including such in the key Western Siberian region, which is expected to ease the tax burden and at the same time encourage field development.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Key-Swing-Producer-Behind-The-OPEC-Deal.html,"Dec 21, 2018 at 17:19 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Dec 21, 2018",The Key Swing Producer Behind The OPEC+ Deal
2018-12-21,"Energy planners in Saudi Arabia must be scratching their heads in wonder, even possibly despair. The oil-rich kingdom had picked itself up after threats of near economic collapse in 2015-2016 amid a then oversupply scenario in global oil markets with prices that dropped to multi-year lows, but now things are looking grim once again.After the kingdom's ill-fated decision in late 2014 to open the oil production spigots and ramp up production in the midst of an oil supply glut mostly due to increased U.S. shale oil production, prices tumbled. They had reached over $100 per barrel in mid-2014, but by January 2016 had dipped below the psychologically important and economically damaging $30 per barrel price point.The results for the Saudis was cataclysmic, with problems ranging from historically high budget deficits (reaching a then-record high of $98 billion in 2015) to being forced to put in place its first ever and politically unpopular austerity measures as well as issuing its first international bond sale to raise much-needed funds.By October 2016, with Saudi state coffers low and the government bleeding red ink, Mohamed Al Tuwaijri, the Saudi deputy economic minister, said in a rare appearance on national television, “if we (Saudi Arabia) didn’t take any reform measures, and if the global economy stays the same, then we’re doomed for bankruptcy in three to four years.""The formation of OPEC+By late 2016, the Saudis had had enough and were forced to turn to non-OPEC producers to stop the pain, including oil production heavyweight and longtime adversary Russia, forming what is now known as OPEC+. The new group of oil producing partners was able to trim oil production enough to restore OECD oil inventory levels back to five year averages around the third quarter of 2017 and not only put a floor under prices, in essence restoring a semblance of market equilibrium, but their actions drove prices to four year highs this October, so high that it created concerns of demand destruction.  Related: Can China Save South Sudan’s Oil Sector?As the Saudis, albeit with Russia’s help, regained control of global oil markets, it seemed that the kingdom got its swagger back, including a global charm offensive by its young and charismaticde facto leader Mohammed bin Salman. His softer tone with longtime regional foe Israel, his close relationship with the Trump administration and his plans to revamp the Saudi economy, including less dependency on oil revenue seemed too good to be true - but at the end of the day, it fell apart.The global oil price plungeGlobal oil markets became saturated again, oil prices have quickly dropped around 40 percent since reaching October highs, along with slowing global economic growth in large part due to ongoing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing are setting in. On top of this laundry list of oil market worries, the world’s top three oil producers, the U.S., Russia and Saudi Arabia, have been pumping oil at record levels.Waning Saudi prestigeHowever, the biggest detriment in the Saudi plan to revamp both its global image and its economy has been Saudi implication in the controversial death of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in early October in the Saudi consulate in Turkey. Now, amid still fresh wounds to Saudi prestige as well as doubt over bin Salman’s ability to rule the kingdom, foreign investment in Saudi Arabia is drying up, possibly taking the kingdom precipitously close to the dismal days of 2015 and 2016 when it looked like Saudi Arabia could come apart at the seams.  Related: Chinese Refiners Aren’t Buying U.S. CrudeMeanwhile, oil prices are continuing their downward trajectory, with wilder swings that previous markets, likely due to increased speculation and more electric trading of the commodity. Global oil benchmark Brent crude is now trading in the mid-$50s range, while U.S. oil benchmark, NYMEX-traded West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is hovering in the mid-$40s range, a price point unthinkable just two months ago.It remains to be seen if the new OPEC+ oil production deal to trim output by 1.2 million b/d, starting in January and lasting for six months, with a review period in April, will help oil market jitters and be enough to dry up oversupply. However, given that the U.S. will continue to ramp up production, to an U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated 12.1 million b/d or higher next year, and with the likelihood that no trade deal will be reached between Washington and Beijing by their self-imposed March 2 deadline, oil markets will likely remain nervous with prices through the first quarter remaining in the mid $40 to mid $50s range or possibly lower, at which point déjà vu will set in for Saudi Arabia, all too reminiscent of a few years ago when the kingdom barely survived economically.

2018-12-21,"Total U.S. oil production around 2025 will almost equal the combined production of Russia and Saudi Arabia, Fatih Birol, the Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), told Turkish state-run Anadolu Agency on Friday.The huge growth in U.S. shale production will completely change the balance of oil markets, Birol told the news agency.The IEA’s Oil 2018 report from earlier this year sees the United States dominating the global oil supply growth over the next five years.OPEC capacity will grow only modestly by 2023, while most of the growth will come from non-OPEC countries, led by the United States, “which is becoming ever more dominant in the global oil market,” the IEA said.Driven by light tight oil, U.S. production is seen growing by 3.7 million bpd by 2023, more than half of the total global production capacity growth of 6.4 million bpd expected by then. Total liquids production in the United States—including conventional oil, shale, and natural gas liquids—will reach nearly 17 million bpd by 2023, “easily making it the top global producer, and nearly matching the level of its domestic products demand,” the IEA said in March this year.  “The United States is set to put its stamp on global oil markets for the next five years,” Birol said back then.The U.S. is currently pumping oil at record levels of more than 11 million bpd, while Russia and Saudi Arabia—which also hit record highs in October and November, respectively—will curtail 230,000 bpd and 322,000 bpd of their production in the first six months of 2019, respectively.In its December Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects U.S. crude oil production to have averaged 11.5 million bpd in November, up by 150,000 bpd from October, thanks to platforms resuming normal operations after hurricane-related outages in October. The EIA sees U.S. crude oil production averaging 10.9 million bpd this year, jumping from 9.4 million bpd in 2017. The forecast for next year’s U.S. crude oil production currently stands at 12.1 million bpd.

2018-12-20,"Even before the latest oil price plunge that sent WTI Crude prices to below $50 a barrel, analysts had expected the explosive growth in the U.S. shale patch to cool off a bit next year - at least until the Permian pipeline constraints ease in the latter half of 2019.U.S. shale is set to continue to raise crude oil production, but as WTI prices dipped to below the psychologically important threshold of $50 a barrel, analysts started to calculate which areas may have already fallen into the red with spot prices lower than breakevens.To be sure, U.S. oil production is expected to continue to increase next year, but the longer the U.S. benchmark oil price stays below or around $50, the slower the growth will be.This week’s fresh price plunge could make more U.S. shale drillers cut capital expenditure for next year and more of them may cut deeper, considering that few had anticipated such a steep drop in oil prices just two and a half months ago, when WTI was above $70 when the market feared a supply crunch due to the U.S. sanctions on Iran.Yet, even in the face of this week’s plunge that sent WTI below $50, some analysts say that the glory days for U.S. shale are not over.“In short, as much as the recent price slump has injected a fresh dose of uncertainty, it is unlikely to derail the U.S. shale engine,” according to Stephen Brennock, oil analyst at PVM Oil Associates. “The fact is that U.S. tight oil supply is expected to expand by at least 1 million bpd in 2019. In doing so, it will go a long way to cementing America’s newfound position as the world's biggest oil producer,” CNBC quoted a Wednesday research note by Brennock as saying. “For now, when it comes to the U.S. shale patch, the glory days are far from over,” said Brennock.  Related: Major LNG Shortage Increasingly LikelyThe EIA expects the seven key shale regions in the U.S. to continue raising oil production next month. In the monthly Drilling Productivity Report from this week, the EIA estimates that the seven shale areas will boost their combined production by 134,000 bpd from December to 8.166 million bpd in January, with the Permian leading the way, followed by the Eagle Ford and the Bakken.In this month’s Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), EIA sees total U.S. crude oil production averaging 10.9 million bpd in 2018, up from 9.4 million bpd in 2017, and expects crude production to average 12.1 million bpd in 2019.If oil prices stay stubbornly low, however, the current forecast of 1.2-million-bpd production growth next year may be too optimistic. Many wells in the Permian may still be in the profit at below-$50 oil, but many others outside top-tier acreage—which were easily making money with $60 oil—won’t. Areas in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford will also struggle with oil in the low $50s or below.This week, while WTI at Cushing is above $45, the price of WTI Midland in the heart of the Permian slumped to $40.Even before the latest major price correction, analysts had expected U.S. shale drillers to scale back capital budgets for 2019, considering that the price slump could restrain cash flow generation at a time when investors push for more returns at the expense of oil production growth.Just this week, Diamondback Energy announced its 2019 capital and production guidance, which reflects “an operating plan focused on disciplined growth within cash flow and a growing dividend in the current commodity price environment.” Diamondback plans to operate between 18 and 22 drilling rigs, compared to 24 operated drilling rigs today, reducing rig count by three rigs immediately, the company said on Tuesday.

As a result, and as a sign of our commitment to capital discipline, we are reducing our planned 2019 activity to levels where we can operate within cash flow,” Diamondback’s CEO Travis Stice said, noting that future activity will depend on the commodity price trend in 2019.According to Francisco Blanch, head of global commodity and derivatives research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, WTI Crude will average $59 a barrel next year, which would be sufficient to warrant U.S. shale growth of 1.2 million bpd-1.3 million bpd.“If we stay at these levels around $50 a barrel WTI, we’re going to grow sub-1 million barrels a day,” Blanch told CNBC this week.U.S. shale will still grow next year, but the oil price range will determine the pace of that growth.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/50-Oil-Wont-Kill-US-Shale.html,"Dec 20, 2018 at 15:40 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Dec 20, 2018",$50 Oil Won’t Kill U.S. Shale
2018-12-20,"U.S. pipeline infrastructure is more vulnerable to cyberattacks than desirable because of insufficient oversight in the cybersecurity department, a report commissioned by two members of Congress has suggested.Reuters reported this week that the report, requested by Senator Maria Cantwell and Representative Frank Pallone and conducted by the General Accountability Office, revealed the Transport Security Administration, a unit of Homeland Security, does not have a procedure in place that can be used to update cybersecurity standards for pipelines. These updates are necessary to reflect revisions in cybersecurity standards that are seen by experts in the field as essential.Indeed, the cybersecurity field is a very dynamic one, with attackers unfortunately proving repeatedly they are not just keeping up with cybersecurity efforts but sometimes even being a step ahead of them. This is what necessitates updates to existing standards, and an update implementation procedure that makes for fast adoption of these updates.Oil and gas pipelines are critical infrastructure and as such they are among the top targets of cybercriminals, according to experts. What the report by the GAO found was that the Transport Security Administration trusted pipeline operators to evaluate their networks and report whether they have critical facilities that could become a target for cybercriminals.That’s not good enough to say the least: the TSA collected the self-evaluations in order to classify parts of operator’s networks as more or less vulnerable, but it turned out that as much as a 33 percent of the operators of the 100 biggest pipeline systems in the United States denied having critical facilities. What’s more, the Transport Security Administration did not verify the information supplied by pipeline operators.“Protecting our pipelines, and the people who live and work near them, must be a top priority for our government and I hope this report will prompt the Trump administration to start treating this challenge with the urgency it deserves,” Senator Cantwell said in a release following the report.  Related: Major LNG Shortage Increasingly LikelyPipeline cybersecurity is certainly a top concern, especially with the growing automation and digitization of various functions that gives cybercriminals more potential entry points into a network. Work is being done but, if we are to believe the GAO report, not enough, which is the case for other industries as well in the opinion of most cybersecurity professionals.Still, earlier this month, the Transport Security Administration released a Cybersecurity Roadmap that covered all transportation sectors, including pipelines. In a recent overview of the situation in Lexology, Norma M. Krayem noted that unlike other comparable industries, pipeline networks have so many agencies overseeing them, a debate about which of them should be in charge of cybersecurity has slowed down the actual implementation of cybersecurity measures.The roadmap, Krayem said, was the document that put an end to the debate: the TSA is the agency in charge of the cybersecurity and physical security of pipeline systems, so that’s one thing that is settled. Now, what remains is the more important task: put actual cybersecurity standards and procedures in place to secure this part of the U.S. critical infrastructure.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/A-Shocking-Amount-Of-Crucial-US-Pipelines-Still-Lack-Cybersecurity.html,"Dec 20, 2018 at 12:59 | Irina Slav","Dec 20, 2018",A Shocking Amount Of Crucial U.S. Pipelines Still Lack Cybersecurity
2018-12-19,"Can the U.S. shale boom continue if WTI stays mired below $50 per barrel?Much has been made about the dramatic cost reductions that shale drillers have implemented over the past few years, with impressive breakeven prices that should ensure the drilling frenzy continues no matter where oil prices go. On earnings calls with investors and analysts, shale executives repeatedly trumpeted extremely low breakeven prices.However, those figures are at times cherry-picked or otherwise misleading. They fail to include the cost of land acquisition and other costs, or they simply reflect cost structures in only the very best acreage.The sudden meltdown in prices – oil fell nearly 8 percent on Tuesday – could put renewed scrutiny on the point at which many shale wells breakeven.The problem for a lot of companies is that they are not necessarily earning the full WTI price. Oil in West Texas in the Permian Basin continues to trade at a steep discount relative to WTI, even as the differential has narrowed in recent months. With WTI at roughly $47 or $48 per barrel, oil based in Midland is trading below $40 per barrel, the lowest point in more than two years, according to Bloomberg.Bloomberg NEF data provides more clues into the complex “breakeven” debate. Wells located in the Spraberry (within the Permian basin) can breakeven when prices trade between $32 and $47 per barrel. Digging deeper, Bloomberg NEF notes that some of the best wells can break even in the low $30s, but the worst quartile of wells breakeven at an average of $65.54 per barrel.In other words, a large portion of wells in the Permian – which, to be clear, is often held up as the best shale basin in the world – is currently unprofitable, given WTI priced in the high-$40s per barrel. The problem is even worse for areas outside of the Permian, where breakevens are on average much higher. Arguably only the very best wells in the Bakken, the Eagle Ford and the Niobrara are making money right now.That puts the heady production figures from the EIA for 2019 into doubt. The agency expects the U.S. to grow production by 1.2 million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2019, another very large annual increase. However, that growth is predicated on higher oil prices. “If WTI remains around current levels (~$50/bbl), US growth should start to slow,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a recent note.There are some mitigating circumstances that could shield shale producers from the worst. Shale E&Ps routinely hedge their production for the year ahead. Just months ago, some of those hedges looked like a bad bet – producers had locked in prices in the $50s or so for much of 2018, even as oil prices over the summer traded much higher than that. For instance, Anadarko Petroleum said it missed out on $298 million in revenue because it locked itself into hedges at price levels lower than the prevailing spot price.  Related: The Race Is On: Big Oil Rushes To Supply The 1 Billion DisconnectedOn the other hand, for those that locked in sales for 2019 production in, say, the $60s per barrel, might feel pretty good about that right about now. To the extent a shale company has already secured hedging for 2019, they may not alter their drilling plans for next year all that much.Unfortunately for many, though, is the fact that the industry has held off on some hedging for next year, assuming prices could climb even higher. “Producers have a lower proportion of their next 12 months oil production hedged for this time of year relative to the last few years,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note.Another reason why supply might not actually be severely curtailed despite low prices is that shale companies could simply keep up their pace of drilling in 2019 and take on more debt, just as they did for so many years. The assumed production growth rate might not change all that much, even as balance sheets deteriorate.Related: Saudi Oil Minister: Crude Stocks Should Drop Very SoonStandard Chartered provides some more insight, with a look at the rate of well completions: “We estimate that 374 completions per month are currently required in the Permian to offset declines. The number of Permian completions in November was 65 higher than the breakeven completion rate at 439,” the investment bank wrote in a note. “The number of completions would then have to fall about 17% before Permian output stopped growing. While we expect a slowdown in completions if the price of WTI in Midland, Texas were to remain close to the current USD 42/bbl, we would not expect a fall in completions large enough to halt net growth.”Finally, sub-$50 oil might not be a huge problem if benchmark prices rebound in the relatively near future. Saudi oil minister Khalid al-Falih tried to reassure the market this week that we will not see a repeat of the 2014-2016 meltdown. “We remain focused on fundamentals, I can tell you we will achieve balance between supply and demand in 2019,” he told reporters. There will be enormous pressure on OPEC+ to extend the latest production cuts through the end of 2019.But the longer low prices stick around, the more significant the impact will be on production. “If strip prices remain subdued into early 2019 at around $50 WTI, we would expect budgets to be set at levels that reduce the trend rate of growth, all else equal, which we would expect to become more noticeable by 2020,” Morgan Stanley concluded.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Shale-Growth-Could-Slow-On-Oil-Price-Meltdown.html,"Dec 19, 2018 at 14:24 | Nick Cunningham","Dec 19, 2018",Shale Growth Could Slow On Oil Price Meltdown
2018-12-19,"Qatar is continuing to make energy headline news. The tiny kingdom is forging its own path even at the expense of recently pulling out of OPEC to focus on its liquefied natural gas (LNG) ambitions. However, its decision to pull the plug on its involvement with OPEC was also likely a geopolitical move against Saudi Arabia and other Arab neighbors that put in place a blockade and economic measures against Doha over what they allege is state sponsorship of terror groups, an allegation that the country vehemently denies.Over the weekend, news broke that Qatar is now aiming to invest billions in the North American energy patch, including a new deal with Italian energy company Eni for three oil fields in Mexico, as well as making an investment decision by the end of the year or January on the Goldan Pass LNG project proposal in Texas. State-run Qatar Petroleum is the majority owner of the Golden Pass LNG terminal, while U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil and U.S.-based independent oil company ConocoPhillips hold smaller stakes.Investing $20 billion in the U.S.Saad Sherida al-Kaabi, the current Minister of Energy in Qatar and head of state-run Qatar Petroleum, said on Sunday that the company will also announce foreign partners for new LNG trains needed for an ambitious domestic scale-up by the middle of next year. He added that as part of its more than $20 billion investment push in the U.S., the company is looking “at gas and oil, conventional and non-conventional.”Self-financing optionsCurrently, Qatar Petroleum is still in talks with international oil firms about the LNG expansion push at home, including Eni, Kaabi said. Other partners already operating in Qatar include Exxon Mobil, French oil major Total, Royal Dutch Shell and Eni. He also said the company could self-finance the LNG expansion rather than borrow, marking a major shift from previous deals where it used lenders to fund up to 70 percent or more of project costs. Kaabi said it could carry out the expansion alone if no good offers from foreign firms were made.Operations in MexicoIn Mexico, Qatar Petroleum and Eni will produce about 90,000 barrels of oil a day from the Amoca, Mizton and Tecoalli fields in the Gulf of Mexico by the end of 2021, Kaabi said at a press conference with Eni Chief Executive Officer Claudio Descalzi in Doha over the weekend. The fields hold 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, according to Kaabi.  Related: Saudi Oil Minister: Crude Stocks Should Drop Very SoonThe companies are already working together on a separate offshore block in Mexico, according to press releases from both companies. Eni gained approval for the developments earlier this year and needs the Mexican authorities to sign off on Sunday’s deal. For its part, Qatar Petroleum now has operations in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Oman, Congo, South Africa, Cyprus and Mozambique.Flexing its musclesThe timing of Qatar’s proactive moves comes just a few weeks after it shocked energy markets by announcing it would withdraw its decades-long membership from OPEC starting in January. Perhaps more importantly, Qatar’s energy push in both the U.S., Mexico as well as other countries shows that it can flex its muscles and its wealth despite being ostracized by most of its middle eastern neighbors. Mexico, for its part, is keen to attract foreign direct investment to jump-start its struggling oil sector. Last week, the country’s new government gave plans to build an $8 billion oil refinery in the home state of new President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, in addition to renovating six other plants as the nation attempts to lower its dependence on imported fuel.Qatar’s interest in the U.S. LNG sector is also a stroke of both geopolitical and energy markets savvy since the U.S. could by the mid part of the next decade compete with Qatar as the top LNG producer in terms of liquefaction capacity as the so-called second wave of U.S. LNG project development becomes operational.Jockeying for top global LNG slotHowever, Qatar is also developing a fourth LNG production train to increase its liquefaction capacity from a current 77 million tons per annum (mtpa) to 110 mtpa by around 2023. The new additional volumes be secured by doubling the size of the new gas project in the southern sector of the North Field, which Qatar Petroleum had announced earlier. Yet, going forward, Australia, which has briefly overtaken Qatar as the top LNG exporter, and even Russia, will all vie for top global LNG exporter status even after Qatar ramps up its production.

The major LNG buyers - CNOOC, CPC, JERA, KOGAS, PetroChina, Sinopec and Tokyo Gas - together account for more than 5 percent of the global LNG market, Wood Mackenzie added.Revamped relations with RiyadhFinally, Qatar said on Friday that negotiations to end the feud with its Arab neighbors can only begin after the Saudi-led group ends the embargo on the gas-rich country. “Our position on the solution hasn’t changed,” Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani said at a conference in Doha on Saturday. “The blockade should be lifted, and the dispute resolved with dialogue based on mutual respect and non-intervention in the internal affairs of states.”Last week, according to a Bloomberg report, Sheikh Tamim turned down an invitation from Saudi Arabia’s King Salman to attend a gathering of Gulf monarchies. This initial gesture was seen as a sign of thawing relations after 18 months of Qatar’s boycott by the kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt.By Tim Daiss for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Tiny-Qatar-Flexes-Its-Muscles-With-Oil-And-Gas-Investment-Push.html,"Dec 19, 2018 at 11:19 | Tim Daiss","Dec 19, 2018",Tiny Qatar Flexes Its Muscles With Oil And Gas Investment Push
2018-12-19,"India will use five escrow accounts in Iranian banks to pay for deliveries of Iranian crude oil amid U.S. sanctions, Bloomberg reports, citing sources close to the situation. The accounts are in the name of state Indian lender UCO Bank.The payments will be made in Indian rupees in a bid to avoid punitive action from Washington, the sources also said. Also, the deposits are spread across five banks to reduce risk in case Washington decides to add more Iranian banks to its sanction list.“We already have 15 Iranian bank accounts, out of these five have come under secondary sanctions,” the managing director of UCO Bank said yesterday. He also said, however, the other 10 are still good to use for bilateral transactions.Iran, according to the Bloomberg sources, will use the money to cover the expenses of its diplomatic missions in India, and to buy essential goods.The information should not come as a surprise despite the United States’ efforts to distance India from Iran and wean it off its oil. One of the world’s top consumers of crude imports almost 80 percent of the oil it guzzles, and it is extremely vulnerable to price shocks, so Iranian crude remains vital for India.Since the price of the oil it buys is of the utmost importance, Iran’s favorable credit terms and lower prices are certainly an attractive alternative to a long and difficult process of finding other—and costlier—sources of the commodity. Despite higher intake of Saudi and U.S. oil, completely replacing Iranian crude has proven more than just tricky.In recognition of the fact, Washington granted India, along with another seven large Iran oil importers, a six-month waiver from the sanctions with the caveat these importers were expected to reduce their intake of Iranian crude further.

2018-12-18,"Libya’s National Oil Company NOC has once again shocked the oil market by officially declaring force majeure on its operations at the El Sharara oilfield, the largest oilfield in the country. After months of continued optimism in the media and political statements coming out of Paris and Rome about a possible peace deal between the two competing governments, led by Libyan general Haftar and his counterpart El Serraj, the situation on the ground is looking even worse than before. The eagerly awaited oil production increase from Libya, which could supposedly mitigate the effects of falling production from Iran and Venezuela, now seems unlikely to happen. NOC officials stated that the production of the 315,000 bpd field, which is located in the south of Libya, has been blocked by protestors and militias in the area. A group of tribes, armed protestors and guards took over the field on December 8, asking for salary payments and additional financing. Until now, Libyan government officials have been unable to quell the protests. NOC officials have reiterated that the financial demands will not be met, as this could set a precedent for other oil and gas operations in the country.It is still unclear who the real culprits behind the current blockade and seizure of the field are as sources are blaming different groups or militias. NOC claims that the field has been taken over by a militia that is reportedly trying to get on the payroll of the field guards. No indication at present can be given as to when the field will come back onstream. NOC’s chairman Mustafa Sanallah has called for the force majeure in a move to provide security to the workers at the field.In recent weeks, several other fields have also been occupied, blocked or taken over – but production has not been significantly impacted at those fields. Tribal representatives and several militias have indicated to the press that the current blockade is a protest against marginalization and shortages of electricity, fuel and money.It is the UN-EU backed Libyan government GNA that is feeling the brunt of the pain from these protests. The militias and tribal groups are currently targeting GNA operations as the Tripoli-based government has been accused of marginalizing the southerners.  Related: Big Oil Stocks Crash As Crude Prices TumbleLibya’s oil and gas fields and infrastructure, including the export ports, such as Zawya, have been the main targets in the ongoing civil war between the two competing governments after the removal of Libyan leader Muammar Ghadaffi. At the same time, several major extremist fundamentalist groups, such as Daesh/ISIS and AL Qaeda are also very active in parts of the country. For months, the power struggle between the GNA and the forces of General Haftar has been concentrated around Libya’s main economic artery, its oil and gas fields. Haftar, supported by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Russia, appears to be winning this struggle, slowly but steadily taking over more of the country.Haftar has been able to tighten his hold also over the so-called Petroleum Facilities Guard, a para-military security force tasked with securing oil and gas operations. At the El Sharara field, the main occupying force at present seems to be the same Petroleum Facilities Guards.In addition to the force majeure at the oilfield, security forces in Libya’s Tobruk Port said to the press that the port was closed indefinitely for security concerns, a statement that was followed by gunmen storming the port on Sunday. In October 2017 the port was closed for a long period due to pressure from General Haftar’s so-called Dignity Operation.Overall, Libya’s political and oil future is a shambles. Even after high-level meetings in Paris and Rome, where the French and Italian government tried to set up their own security and governmental arrangements between the fighting factions, the is no end in sight to the fighting on the ground. Currently, another round of violence is brewing in and around Tripoli, where several militias are looking to expand their control over parts of the city, weakening the power of the Western-backed Government of National Accord (GNA). Since a brokered ceasefire in September, most militias have been pulling back, but the tensions at present point to a willingness for a new round of conflict. The UN-GNA approach to either include the militias in security forces or demobilize them is under pressure. Still, some hope remains, as analysts indicate that militia leaders are willing to cooperate, largely in a move to protect their (illegal) income. Stability - in the end - will depend on the willingness of the GNA forces to put their foot down if needed  Related: Libya Declares Force Majeure On Largest Oil FieldEven if the Tripoli situation can be resolved, the future depends largely on General Haftar. Haftar is looking for any opportunity to expand his powers to the western parts of Libya, having already secured most of the east. Haftar still openly pushes his pledge to “liberate” Tripoli by forging alliances in the west. Arab countries, such as the UAE and Egypt, are supporting Haftar to make a deal with western Libyan militias to stabilize the whole country. NATO-member Italy has also shown a preference for the Haftar option, especially after Moscow openly stated its support of the Libyan general.Even French president Macron pushed the position of Haftar during the Paris meeting of the GNA and Haftar militias. In Paris Haftar and his counterpart Al Serraj agreed to a ceasefire and Spring elections, but the general declared hours later that he has no intention of sticking to that agreement. Past attempts to negotiate peace in Libya have been undone by splits within each faction, which are often made up of loose alliances of convenience among brigades of former rebels more loyal to cities, regions or tribes than to the idea of a Libyan nation. Haftar now seems to have the upper-hand, after partially defeating IS led militias and other extremists.None of this bodes well for Libya’s oil operations. Haftar’s next moves towards Tripoli will almost certainly be a military operation to win all oil and gas fields that are currently under GNA influence. More actions and possible disruptions can be expected very soon.By Cyril Widdershoven for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Libyan-Oil-In-Jeopardy-As-Peace-Talks-Fail.html,"Dec 18, 2018 at 15:29 | Cyril Widdershoven","Dec 18, 2018",Libyan Oil In Jeopardy As Peace Talks Fail
2018-12-18,"After a week’s blockade by a militant group, Libya’s largest oil field, Sharara, has been shuttered by a force majeure declaration by the National Oil Corporation. Reuters cited a statement issued by NOC, saying that production from the field will resume when “alternative security arrangements are put in place.”This force majeure follows another one from last week that covered exports from the blocked field, which pumps more than 300,000 bpd, contributing almost a third of Libya’s national total.The latest problems for the field, which has already become the target of several production interruptions this year, began a week ago. Initial reports said the blockaders comprised local tribesmen and members of the Petroleum Facilities Guard—the group that until two years ago held control of Libya’s four export terminals in the Oil Crescent, demanding payment from the government to allow crude to be exported, severely affecting production.Later during the week things escalated when the PFG demanded money from the government to lift the blockade from Sharara. NOC’s chairman warned this course of action would be ill-advised.Mustafa Sanalla said that if the Libyan Ministry of Finance paid the militants, this would set a dangerous precedent that would endanger Libya’s economic recovery. A day earlier, Sanalla said in a letter to the Prime Minister of the UN-recognized government of Libya that if a ransom was paid, NOC would not restart production at Sharara or lift the force majeure on the Zawiya export terminal and refinery, where the crude from Sharara goes, putting the government between a rock and a hard place.""I want to be clear, this militia has to leave the field immediately,” Sanalla said in a statement last week. “We stand wholeheartedly with the people of the south and understand their concerns. At NOC we are doing all we can to improve the living conditions of the residents. Their legitimate demands and grievances however have been used by criminals who are only in pursuit of self-interest.”By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Libya-Declares-Force-Majeure-On-Largest-Oil-Field.html,"Dec 18, 2018 at 10:03 | Irina Slav","Dec 18, 2018",Libya Declares Force Majeure On Largest Oil Field
2018-12-17,"The OPEC+ cuts still are not doing very much to boost oil prices, dashing hopes for many U.S. shale producers. With companies in the process of formulating their budgets for 2019, the prospect of $50 oil sticking around raises questions about the heady production figures expected from the shale patch.The IEA expects U.S. oil production to grow by 1.3 million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2019. But oil prices could significantly impact those projections. “Total U.S. shale oil growth is highly sensitive to WTI prices in the $40-60 range,” Morgan Stanley wrote in a December 13 note. The investment bank said that shale producers are growing more sensitive to prices below $60 but less sensitive to price spikes above $60. “If WTI remains around current levels (~$50/bbl), US growth should start to slow.”The investment bank said that larger companies, such as ConocoPhillips or Occidental Petroleum, are less sensitive to price swings than smaller E&Ps. On the other hand, some companies could begin to slow production if prices linger at low levels. Morgan Stanley pointed to Apache Corp., Murphy Oil, Newfield Exploration, Oasis Petroleum, Whiting Petroleum and Chesapeake Energy. “With low oil prices, we see these companies slowing production growth in 2019 to spend within cash flow (or minimize outspend), [free cash flow] levels fall or turn negative, and leverage metrics move higher.”  Related: Equinor Starts Up Major Gas Field In Norwegian SeaOther analysts also see price sensitivity from the shale sector. “We expect 5-10% capex growth on average at $59 WTI, which should yield production growth of nearly 1.3mn b/d,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a note. “However producers may budget for lower oil prices given the recent decline in prices and increase in uncertainty.”BofAML went on to add: “We believe the $50 to $60 price range for WTI yields highly variable E&Ps budgets. In a mid to low $50s WTI scenario, producer budgets would likely come in flat to lower YoY and would likely lower US production growth to somewhere closer to 1mn b/d for next year.”There is one major obstacle that the shale sector faced in 2018 that could start to dissipate: pipeline constraints.U.S. shale producers and pipeline companies have deployed a variety of methods to mitigate the impact of pipeline constraints.The higher-than-expected production figures from U.S. shale this year largely come down to the ability of producers and pipeline companies to work around the swelling bottleneck, particularly in the Permian. Pipeline operators have used drag reducing agents to speed up the flow of oil through the lines, allowing them to ship more oil than the nameplate capacity suggests. Also, the Plains All American Sunrise pipeline came online ahead of schedule, which also relieved some congestion. No major outages occurred in 2018, which has been “an element of luck” given the high throughput rates, the IEA said in its Oil Market Report.More projects are set to come online in 2019, which should reduce the pressure on oil producers. The Bridgetex and the Sunrise expansions will add 40,000 and 175,000 bpd in the first half of 2019, respectively. Another 100,000 bpd will come from the Cactus 2, while Enterprise Products Partners could add 200,000 bpd by converting a natural gas liquids pipeline to crude oil.  Related: These Countries Found The Most Oil In 2018That should be close to enough to avoiding production impacts. “Takeaway capacity growth will therefore closely track output growth in the Permian, but it will still lag behind until the second half of 2019, when the 675 kb/d EPIC project comes online,” the IEA said.To be sure, the midstream challenges are not entirely resolve just yet. Pipeline “congestion at the Cushing hub should persist during 1H19, keeping pressure on WTI timespreads and differentials to Brent relatively wide,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note.Also, the margin is tight – the multiple pipeline projects slated for operation in 2019 need to stay on schedule, while the midstream sector needs to avoid any unexpected outage. “Operators can ill afford major pipeline or refinery shutdowns during that time, as this would only exacerbate the shortage,” the IEA cautioned.However, by the end of 2019, there will be very few midstream constraints holding back the shale industry. New planned export terminals will also clear the path for oil to be shipped overseas in ever rising volumes. “[P]ipeline and export projects slated for completion by 2020 should unchain North American oil production growth early in the next decade,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Shale-Under-Pressure-As-Oil-Falls-Below-50.html,"Dec 17, 2018 at 14:03 | Nick Cunningham","Dec 17, 2018",Shale Under Pressure As Oil Falls Below $50
2018-12-17,"Iran’s revenues from crude oil and oil products surged by 55 percent between March and October, the first seven months of the Iranian year, compared to the same period of the previous year, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported on Monday, quoting data from the Central Bank of Iran.  Between March and October, Iran’s oil exports revenues were helped by high volumes of exports early in the period—with Iran’s oil exports at record in April and May, and later on with the high oil prices in the late summer and early fall.Iranian crude oil and oil product revenues in the first four months of the Iranian year beginning March 21 until July 23 jumped by 60 percent on the year to reach the equivalent of US$9.9 billion, according to Iran’s central bank.After July, however, Iran’s oil exports started to drop noticeably as buyers were unwilling to commit amid uncertainties over whether anyone would be receiving a U.S. waiver to continue importing oil from Iran.The U.S. pledge to drive Iranian oil exports down to ‘zero’ led to fears of a supply crunch and oil prices shot up to four-year highs in early October.In early November, U.S. sanctions returned, and with them came waivers to eight key Iranian oil buyers to continue importing reduced volumes of Iranian oil until early May 2019.In October, with lack of certainty over U.S. waivers, crude oil exports from Iran to Asian countries—its biggest clients—sank to average 762,000 bpd, official customs data and shipping data reported by Reuters revealed. This was the lowest monthly average for Iranian crude oil exports to Asia in five years and a 56.4-percent decline on an annual basis.The U.S. sanctions have effectively removed around 1 million bpd of Iranian oil from the market, but Iran is still estimated to be exporting more than 1 million bpd of crude oil.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Iran-Claims-Its-Oil-Revenues-Surged-Despite-Sanctions.html,"Dec 17, 2018 at 10:36 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Dec 17, 2018",Iran Claims Its Oil Revenues Surged Despite Sanctions
2018-12-17,"2018 stands already as the best year for global oil and gas exploration since 2015. Guyana, Russia and the United States top the list with major discoveries.Discovered resources have already surpassed 8.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) for 2018. Rystad Energy, the independent energy research and consulting firm headquartered in Norway with offices around the world, expects the number to grow to 9.4 billion boe by year-end.(Click to enlarge)“We at Rystad expect this discovery trend to continue into 2019 with many promising high-impact wells targeting vast potential,” says Palzor Shenga, senior analyst on Rystad Energy’s Upstream team.Offshore discoveries represent around 82% of total volumes. 2018 has also seen a significant uptick in the reserve replacement ratio to around 15% from 11% in 2017.“Global exploration activity and discoveries have halted their year-after-year decline and look set to rise in the next year. This as an exciting recovery which runs contrary to a decline in global exploration spending from 2014 to 2017,” Shenga adds.

2018-12-14,"Supermajors are taking on more renewable energy commitments lately as they prepare for a less carbon-intensive future. Some of them are going a step further, coupling these green commitments with humanist causes such as providing access to energy to part of the one billion people all over the world who have no electricity.Power for All director William Brent reviewed in a recent story this push that will see Shell, Total, French Engie, Schneider Electric and others of their caliber, build electricity supply from clean sources for 200 million of this one billion within the next ten years. Shell is the most ambitious, aiming to provide access to electricity for 100 million, and Total plans to provide 25 million people in Africa with solar energy derived power within the next two years.Others are also catching up with the green agenda. Exxon recently announced it had inked a 12-year deal with Danish renewable energy company Orsted to buy 500 MW of electricity produced by solar and wind farms to power its oil production in the Permian. The deal reflects falling renewable energy prices, which is making renewable energy a lot more competitive with fossil fuels, not to mention the reputational effect its deployment would have on Big Oil-- and Big Oil is in serious need of news that is good for its reputation. Even with a redoubling of efforts to move more quickly into renewable energy territory, challenges remain, however.Shell and BP, for instance, are being pressured by activist shareholders into doing more to lower their carbon footprint. One such activist shareholder, Dutch group Follow This, has been actively pressuring the companies it holds shares in to be more active in carbon footprint reduction work.  Related: Saudi Arabia Under Fire From All SidesShell’s dealings with the group, whose sole purpose for owning shares in oil companies is to apply the abovementioned pressure, are a case in point. A recent Bloomberg report said Follow This will once again, for the fourth year in a row, present at Shell’s 2019 AGM, a resolution seeking to force the company to move its business goals closer to Paris Accord commitments undertaken by more than a hundred countries.Shell has been Follow This’s first target, and the resolutions, although invariably beaten down by other shareholders, have had an impact and Shell has clearly undertaken more commitments in the cleaner energy transition area.But Follow This is not stopping with Shell. Its resolutions have been garnering growing support despite their failure at the shareholder votes, and the group is now setting its sights on other sector players. BP is facing a resolution of its own with the same call to action, and, according to the group, Chevron and Exxon may also join Shell and BP in case no other shareholder beats Follow This to the resolution tabling line.So, Big Oil is doing more, but it’s nowhere near enough and the latest climate talks in Poland suggests pressure will continue increasing on the industry. Governments met in Poland to devise a rulebook for implementing Paris Agreement commitments, but doing this has turned out to be trickier than maybe some expected. As per a BBC report on the topic, there are too many factors to contend with while deciding on the best way to arrest the warming of the atmosphere. Yet one thing is certain: fossil fuel producers will continue to be in the focus of attention as the biggest culprits behind climate change whatever they do to move into renewables and cut their carbon footprint. After all, whatever they do, until the world doesn’t need oil, oil will be produced.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Race-Is-On-Big-Oil-Rushes-To-Supply-The-1-Billion-Disconnected.html,"Dec 14, 2018 at 15:51 | Irina Slav","Dec 14, 2018",The Race Is On: Big Oil Rushes To Supply The 1 Billion Disconnected
2018-12-14,"A joint venture between troubled Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA and China’s CNPC in the South American country has doubled its oil production in the past seven months, Reuters reported today, quoting a unit of PDVSA, CVP.The joint venture, Sinovensa, accounts for about a tenth of Venezuela’s oil production, which has been falling inexorably over the past few years under the triple burden of the oil price collapse, years of mismanagement and corruption, and U.S. sanctions.CVP said in a Facebook post production at the Sinovensa project, in the Orinoco belt, totaled 130,000 bpd to date. That’s up from just 69,400 bpd in April. The project is the second-largest that involves a foreign company.This particular foreign company has been expanding its share in Sinovensa, as well. In September, PDVSA sold CNPC an additional 9.9 percent in the project, which gave the Chinese company a stake of 49 percent. That’s the highest portion of foreign participation in a Venezuelan project, according to Reuters, as of end-2017.China is Venezuela’s biggest creditor, having provided US$50 billion in loans already. Venezuela has undertaken to repay these with crude oil supplies but has struggled to fulfill its commitments because of falling production and lack of financial means to reverse the fall.In November, Venezuela pumped 1.46 million bpd of oil, a slight increase from the 1.43 million bpd recorded for October but down from over 2 million bpd last year. To add to the country’s oil woes, PDVSA has seen a veritable exodus of qualified personnel, workers’ protests and increased crime activity at oilfields.However, an analyst interviewed by Reuters believes the output increase at Sinovensa is a temporary thing. “They are managing to recover so-called ‘deferred output’ which they had lost due to issues like equipment theft,” Antero Alvarado from Gas Energy Latin America, said. “But this will have a short-term impact because output will fall again and they will need to drill more wells.”  By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Chinese-Venezuelan-Joint-Venture-Doubles-Oil-Production.html,"Dec 14, 2018 at 08:43 | Irina Slav","Dec 14, 2018",Chinese-Venezuelan Joint Venture Doubles Oil Production
2018-12-13,"The oil industry engaged in a secret public relations campaign to undermine U.S. fuel economy standards, according to a new investigation from the New York Times.One of the main actors was the largest oil refiner in the country, Marathon Petroleum. Marathon, along with others, ran a “stealth campaign to roll back car emissions standards,” the NYT reported. The campaign argued that the U.S. no longer needs fuel economy standards because it is now such a massive producer of oil.“With oil scarcity no longer a concern,” Americans should be given a “choice in vehicles that best fit their needs,” a draft letter that was sent to members of Congress said. The Trump administration took up the talking points in its official justification for the proposed watering down of fuel economy standards.Much of the debate about the corporate average fuel economy standards (CAFE), which were set to rise to over 50 miles per gallon by 2025, focused on the position of the auto industry. But California still has the authority to set its own fuel economy standards, something that the Trump administration is now contesting as it seeks to freeze federal standards at 37 mpg beginning in 2020.The auto industry has been the dog that caught the car – it initially pressed the Trump administration to weaken the fuel economy standards, but realized that the aggressive rollback would leave the industry with a patchwork of state levels regulations, led by stricter standards in California. Different standards for different states would require automakers to produce different cars for different markets, a reality that would be more problematic than the more stringent nationwide standards.However, while media coverage focused on this back-and-forth between major automakers, environmentalists and the Trump administration, it appears that oil refiners were waging a stealth PR campaign to convince the public that the standards are no longer needed. Marathon teamed up with the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), according to the NYT investigation, where they pushed facebook ads, and lobbying at the state and federal level. They trumpeted a resolution calling the fuel efficiency standards “a relic of a disproven narrative of resource scarcity.”  Related: Saudi Arabia Can Outwait The Khashoggi CrisisThe motivation is obvious: more efficient vehicles, including hybrids and increasingly electric vehicles, will cut into gasoline sales from refiners. While automakers have to worry about complying with state level fuel standards, refiners simply want to sell more fuel. Marathon’s CEO Gary Heminger told investors in early December on a conference call that the rollback in fuel economy standards would mean the refining industry would sell an additional 350,000 to 400,000 bpd of gasoline.By 2030, freezing the auto standards, as proposed, would lead to increased U.S. oil demand by between 221,000 and 644,000 bpd, according to the Rhodium Group.Some experts argue that the gutting of auto emissions standards would likely result in the largest impact on U.S. greenhouse gas emissions out of any other initiative pursued by the Trump administration, including the rolling back of methane limits, gutting the Clean Power Plan, or opening up vast new acreage for more oil and gas drilling.The cleaning up of the electricity sector – more renewable energy, and a coal-to-gas switch – is happening on its own, due to pricing pressure from cheaper and cleaner sources of energy. Transportation is a tougher nut to crack and stricter federal standards have been critical to improving fuel economy.But oil refiners were never going to sit on the sidelines and let federal regulations cut into their sales.  Related: No, The U.S. Is Not A Net Exporter Of Crude OilAmy Myers Jaffe, a Senior Fellow on Energy and the Environment at the Council on Foreign Relations, summed up the New York Times investigation on twitter:Marathon Petroleum, biggest US refiner, wants you to use more of its product, pay more for gasoline, drive car w inferior tech, lose future jobs to China, enhance Saudi/OPEC power, harm US national security  https://t.co/NWbMtcDB47The oil industry argues that regulations are not needed because the U.S. is such a large producer of oil. This sentiment has permeated much of the political establishment as well, and helps explain the sudden indifference to the selling off of the strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) after decades of rigorous safeguarding of the stockpile. Washington seems to think that producing more oil insulates the country from supply risks.But it doesn’t matter how much oil the U.S. produces, motorists are always going to be vulnerable to price swings so long as they burn a lot of fuel. Even recent data demonstrates this to be true. U.S. gasoline demand actually declined in the third quarter compared to a year earlier, a sharp drop off due to the run up in global crude oil prices. The fact that the U.S. was breaking oil production records did very little to insulate drivers from the price spike. It’s true that U.S. shale has contributed to lower global prices, but removing the most effective demand-side policy from the toolbox is really self-destructive.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-US-Oil-Industrys-Dirty-Little-Secret.html,"Dec 13, 2018 at 16:14 | Nick Cunningham","Dec 13, 2018",The U.S. Oil Industry’s Dirty Little Secret
2018-12-13,"The OPEC+ agreement succeeded in at least putting “a floor under prices,” according to a new report from the International Energy Agency. The global supply surplus is not resolved, and would likely reemerge if OPEC+ let up on its production cuts. But the agreement was welcomed by the IEA in its December Oil Market Report, where the agency noted that oil prices had been extremely volatile in the few months prior to the meeting in Vienna last week.“Recently, prices have been volatile; in early October Brent crude oil prices reached $86/bbl on concerns that the market could tighten as Iranian sanctions were implemented,” the IEA wrote. “Then, thirty-seven days later, they fell back to $58/bbl as producers more than met the challenge of replacing Iranian and other barrels. Such volatility is not in the interests of producers or consumers.”The agency kept its 2018 demand figures steady, but noted that the trend is negative. “Demand will grow by 1.3 mb/d although there are signs that the pace is slackening in some countries as the impact of higher prices lingers.”The oil market is now dominated by the “Big Three,” the IEA said, referring to Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States. Combined those three countries produce 40 percent of global supply. “While the US was not present in Vienna, nobody could ignore its growing influence,” the IEA wrote.  Related: One Houston Gas Player Is Changing The LNG Business ForeverThe U.S. has been rapidly cutting into its own net import dependence on crude, and recently exported more oil and refined products than it imported. For much of this year, the U.S. imported an average of 3.1 mb/d, according to the IEA, a figure that is vastly lower than the more than 11 mb/d it imported regularly a decade ago. In the last week of November, the U.S. had a net export tally of 211,000 bpd. “As production grows inexorably, so will net imports decline and rising US exports will provide competition in many markets, including to some of the countries meeting in Vienna last week,” the IEA stated.Heading into 2019, there is a floor beneath prices with the OPEC+ agreement, but the path to the upside will be a bumpy one. The IEA sees non-OPEC supply growing by more than total global demand next year, which clearly lays out the challenge facing OPEC+. If non-OPEC producers (mainly the U.S.), are set to grow output by 1.5 mb/d in 2019, but demand is only set to rise by 1.4 mb/d, OPEC+ will strictly comply with the production cuts, perhaps for the full year, in order to head off a growing surplus.Moreover, the pace of shale growth continues to confound analysts. This year, shale output is expected to exceed initial estimates by some 1 mb/d. That doesn’t meant shale producers will continue to over perform; pipeline bottlenecks could slow growth, lower prices could curtail drilling activity, and financial pressure could also take a toll.Still, it is a reminder that, at a minimum, shale output is hard to predict. New pipelines are expected come online at the end of next year, which will clear the way for more drilling, completions and shipments to refineries and to the Gulf Coast for export.Other non-OPEC producers probably won’t be as fortunate. Alberta has already put in place mandatory production curbs. The non-OPEC coalition party to the OPEC+ deal have signed on to output limits. Many of the world’s conventional producers are suffering from declines. Brazil is expected to be one of the few non-OPEC countries outside the U.S. that could add supply in 2019, and not by huge amounts. “Thus the US alone is likely to be responsible for the increase in non-OPEC supply, which probably makes the IEA’s forecasted rise of 1.9 million barrels per day too optimistic,” Commerzbank wrote.  Related: Saudi Arabia Can Outwait The Khashoggi CrisisStill, unexpected outages could tighten up the market with little notice. Just days ago, Libya saw roughly 400,000 bpd go offline, much of which came from the country’s massive El Sharara field, because militias were threatening the National Oil Corp.’s operations. Local communities have been protesting the lack of benefits they see from the oil fields. “Regardless of the outcome of this particular dispute, El Sharara will remain particularly vulnerable to disruption,” Hamish Kinnear, MENA analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, said in a statement. “Whereas most of Libya’s major producing fields are located in the LNA-controlled oil crescent, El Sharara is situated in the remote and contested south west.”There are also plenty of other variables that inject a ton of uncertainty into the oil market as we head into 2019. “2019 will be no less challenging than last year for the oil market. The global economy is losing momentum, which could have a dampening effect on demand trends,” Commerzbank said in a new report. “Because the US government is unlikely to extend the granted exemptions from its Iran sanctions in early May, Iranian oil exports will presumably decrease further.”Trade wars, supply growth, economic uncertainty, sanctions, political upheaval and unexpected outages – the IEA may hope for less volatility, but 2019 does not appear to be shaping up that way.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/IEA-OPEC-Put-A-Floor-Under-Prices.html,"Dec 13, 2018 at 15:51 | Nick Cunningham","Dec 13, 2018",IEA: OPEC+ Has Put “A Floor Under Prices”
2018-12-13,"Last week Bloomberg created quite a stir with this story: The U.S. Just Became a Net Oil Exporter for the First Time in 75 Years. I have seen a number of follow-up stories that praised the significance of this development, but others laughed it off as misleading or incorrect.There is some truth to both viewpoints. Yes, the headline is somewhat misleading and requires some context. But there continues to be a trend in the direction of energy independence for the U.S. So, today I want to break down the numbers so readers can understand the truth about U.S. petroleum production, consumption, and exports.Domestic Crude Production Has SurgedThe Bloomberg story is based on data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Each week the EIA publishes detailed statistics on U.S. oil production, consumption, exports, and inventories in a report called the Weekly Petroleum Status Report. So, let’s go straight to the source.For the week ending 11/30/18, the EIA reported that the U.S. produced 11.7 million barrels per day (BPD) of crude oil. That represents a 2 million BPD increase from the year-ago number. This number is generally accepted even by those who believe the Bloomberg headline was misleading.Further down in the report, the category of Products Supplied is listed at 20.5 million BPD. This is approximate U.S. crude oil consumption for the week. Thus, as some skeptics of the story suggested, the bottom line is that the U.S. is burning more than 20 million BPD while producing less than 12 million BPD. Thus, the conclusion for some was that the U.S. isn’t close to being energy independent.Other SupplyBut there is important context between these numbers. First, the 20.5 million BPD is a fairly accurate representation of U.S. consumption, but there is a large U.S. production number that isn’t included in the crude oil production numbers.  Related: Will China Turn Its Back On U.S. LNG?There is a line item called Other Supply, which consists primarily of natural gas liquids (NGLs) and fuel ethanol. This category represents a significant input to refiners in addition to the 11.7 million BPD of production (and the 4.0 million BPD of net crude oil imports). Other Supply represented 6.9 million BPD of production, and it mostly ends up as feedstock for refiners or petrochemical production. (Note that this category also includes “Refinery Processing Gain” of 1.2 million BPD, which results from refiners making products that are of a lower density than crude oil).So, Domestic Production of crude oil plus Other Supply is equal to (11.7 + 6.9) = 18.6 million BPD — which is still about 2 million BPD less than the U.S. consumes.Growing ExportsHowever, these numbers don’t account for exports. During that particular week, the U.S. imported 7.2 million BPD of crude oil, and exported 3.2 million BPD. Thus, net crude oil imports were 4 million BPD.But product exports are a different story. During that week the U.S. imported 1.6 million BPD of finished products, while exporting 5.8 million BPD (which includes some ethanol and NGLs). Net U.S. exports of finished products were 4.2 million BPD. (The U.S. became a net exporter of just finished products in 2011).The U.S. also exports crude oil. President Obama repealed the 40-year old crude oil export ban in 2015, and crude oil exports have soared since. As an aside, the reason the U.S. simultaneously imports, and exports crude is that some of what we produce isn’t a good match for our domestic refineries. So we export some domestic crude and import crude that is a better match for our refineries.Fact CheckSo, here’s a summary of the important inputs to the balance that resulted in the Bloomberg claim:• U.S. crude oil production – 11.7 million BPD• Other supply (NGLs, ethanol, processing gain) – 6.9 million BPD• U.S. crude oil imports – 7.2 million BPD• U.S. crude oil exports – 3.2 million BPD• U.S. finished product imports – 1.6 million BPD• U.S. finished product exports – 5.8 million BPD• U.S. petroleum consumption – 20.5 million BPD  Related: Analysts: Output Cuts To Balance Oil Markets In 2019So the Bloomberg headline results from a net crude oil import number of 4.0 million BPD and a net finished product export number of 4.2 million BPD. So, indeed when you consider crude oil and finished products, for the week ending 11/30/18, the U.S. was a net exporter of 0.2 million BPD of crude plus finished products. (For perspective, this average over the previous four weeks was 2.0 million BPD of net imports).Verdict: Remarkable Achievement, But False HeadlineSignificantly, this is the first time this category of weekly crude plus finished products became an export number since the EIA began reporting this information in 1991. This is a far cry from 2005, when that weekly number hit an all-time-high of 14.4 million BPD. As far as I can tell, Bloomberg is correct that this hasn’t happened in the past 75 years.But that’s not what the headline claimed. The headline said “oil.” The U.S. is still a net importer of oil to the tune of 4.0 million BPD.Further, total U.S. production of oil and other supply that is fed into refineries is 18.6 million BPD, while U.S. consumption is 20.5 million BPD. That still puts U.S. consumption at nearly 2.0 million BPD more than we produce. (It’s actually a little worse than that, because not all NGLs end up as refinery feedstock).So the bottom line is that we aren’t net exporters of crude oil, and we aren’t energy independent. But, the U.S. has trended in that direction for over a decade. Regardless of whether it remains that way, this is undoubtedly a remarkable achievement. I know a lot of people — including myself — would have scoffed at such a prediction in 2005.By Robert RapierMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/No-The-US-Is-Not-A-Net-Exporter-Of-Crude-Oil.html,"Dec 13, 2018 at 11:32 | Robert Rapier","Dec 13, 2018","No, The U.S. Is Not A Net Exporter Of Crude Oil"
2018-12-12,"Now nearly a week removed from the OPEC+ agreement, confidence in the efficacy of the deal is becoming shaky.Immediately after OPEC+ announced cuts of 1.2 million barrels per day (mb/d), a flurry of reports from oil analysts and investment banks congratulated the group on a job well done. After all, the 1.2 mb/d figure was larger than the market had anticipated.However, reality is beginning to set in. First, the cuts might not be realized in January, despite the promise. Russia indicated that it was going to slow walk the cuts, phasing in an initial 50,000 to 60,000 bpd in reductions in January. This is significant because Russia is the main actor in the non-OPEC cohort. The non-OPEC group is expected to slash output by 400,000 bpd, but if Russia is only going to do its part gradually over the next few months, the non-OPEC cuts might not reach the promised levels anytime soon. Moreover, because there are no country-specific allotments, it will be hard to hold any producer accountable.That undermines confidence in the deal. “Compared to early last week, the outcome was rather disappointing, the whole process wasn’t convincing, and it’s still uncertain whether they will actually cut,” ABN Amro senior energy economist Hans van Cleef told Bloomberg.While oil traders are suddenly doubting the integrity of the deal, even if OPEC+ were to adhere to its promised cuts, it still might not be enough. That’s because there are other factors that could leave the market oversupplied. Cracks in the global economy are growing, demand is showing signs of strain, and supply continues to rise.The EIA just issued its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook, and the agency still expects significant production growth from U.S. shale despite the downturn in prices. The EIA lowered its forecasted 2019 WTI prices by $10 per barrel from its previous report, yet it kept its supply forecast unchanged – it still thinks that U.S. oil production will rise from 10.9 mb/d in 2018 to 12.1 mb/d in 2019, despite the significant downward revision in prices.  Related: Morgan Stanley Slashes Oil Price Forecast For 2019In other words, U.S. shale production may not be slowed by the recent downturn in prices in any dramatic way, and at the same time, with its production cut agreement, OPEC+ reassured shale executives that it wouldn’t let prices fall any lower. “The US is not only the world’s largest oil producer at present, but will also remain the leading marginal producer in future,” Commerzbank said in a note.According to Rystad Energy, OPEC+ would need to cut an additional 700,000 bpd in order to balance the market and bring Brent back up to $70 per barrel. “The  OPEC+ agreement predictably came up short of what Rystad Energy argued would be required to fully balance the market in 2019,” Bjornar Tonhaugen, Rystad Energy head of oil market research, said in a statement. “The agreed production cuts will not be enough to ensure sustained and immediate recovery in oil prices. The muted market reaction seen thus far comes as no surprise to us.”Rystad says that the cuts agreed to in Vienna provide a “soft floor” beneath oil prices for now, and the group can still succeed if it extends the cuts through the end of 2019. The OPEC+ coalition is set to evaluate the progress of the cuts in April and might decide to extend the cuts in June if they feel the market needs more time. “Most likely, OPEC will be forced to conduct production management sporadically over the next few years, unless US shale supply grows even faster than we currently expect. OPEC members have their work cut out for them in the years to come,” Rystad’s Tonhaugen said.  Related: 2019: A Pivotal Year For OPECThe supply surplus could still be eliminated by unplanned outages. Libya just lost 400,000 bpd because of encroaching militias, according to the National Oil Corp. Venezuela and Iran are also set to continue to lose output, while Nigeria remains a risk. These events are impossible to predict, and they could quickly erase any supply overhang.For now, though, the oil market is not convinced that the OPEC+ cuts will be sufficient to significantly increase oil prices, despite the initial euphoria surrounding the Vienna agreement.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Why-The-OPEC-Deal-Wont-Cut-It.html,"Dec 12, 2018 at 15:00 | Nick Cunningham","Dec 12, 2018",Why The OPEC+ Deal Won’t Cut It
2018-12-12,"Chevron announced last week its capital and exploratory budget for 2019, which sees the first annual increase in spending since the 2014 oil price crash.While most of the investment is geared toward short-cycle projects that could start bringing in cash flows within two years, the U.S. supermajor continues to channel a significant portion of its upstream investment into a major capital-intensive project to boost the production of a supergiant oil field in western Kazakhstan.Chevron will invest US$4.3 billion in 2019 in the Future Growth Project at the Tengiz field which lies deep beneath the western Kazakhstan steppe—the deepest producing supergiant oil field and the largest single-trap producing reservoir in existence. The investment in boosting production at the giant oil field will take most of Chevron’s US$5.1 billion upstream program for major capital projects in 2019. For this year, Chevron had allocated US$3.7 billion to the Tengiz field expansion project.The Kazakhstan field expansion and the U.S. shale patch are the two pillars of Chevron’s capital spending for next year—growing shorter-cycle shale production and continuing investments in a supergiant oil field that is expected to pump oil for decades.For 2019, Chevron has earmarked US$3.6 billion for expanding its production in the Permian and another US$1.6 billion will be invested in other shale plays in the United States. That makes a total of US$5.2 billion for U.S. shale, which is substantially higher than this year’s shale budget of US$4.3 billion.  Related: Will China Turn Its Back On U.S. LNG?“Our 2019 budget supports a robust portfolio of upstream and downstream investments, highlighted by our world-class Permian Basin position, additional shale and tight development in other basins and our major capital project at TCO in Kazakhstan,” Chevron chairman and CEO Michael K. Wirth said, commenting on next year’s budget.Chevron holds 50 percent in the operator of the Tengiz field, Tengizchevroil (TCO), in which the other shareholders are Kazakhstan’s state-held energy firm KazMunayGas with 20 percent, ExxonMobil Kazakhstan with 25 percent, and LukArco with 5 percent.The so-called Future Growth and Wellhead Pressure Management Project (FGP-WPMP) is planned to increase crude oil production at Tengiz by about 260,000 bpd, and was estimated to cost US$36.8 billion when Chevron approved the expansion project back in 2016.The FGP-WPMP, with first oil planned for 2022, is expected to boost the Tengiz crude oil production capacity by about 260,000 bpd, and the field’s total production will increase to around 1 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day, Chevron says.Tengiz and Kazakhstan operations continue to be a priority for Chevron, while the U.S. major is considering selling its interests in the oil industry of another former Soviet republic—Azerbaijan, as it is re-aligning its global operations to its new priorities after the downturn.  Related: The Solar Tech Flying Under The RadarChevron is looking to sell its 9.6-percent stake in the giant Azeri oil field Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) in the Caspian Sea and its 8.9-percent interest in the BTC pipeline, which carries oil from the ACG field and condensate from Shah Deniz across Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey.Chevron is currently reviewing its global asset portfolio and has “decided to initiate the process of marketing, with a view to a potential sale, of our Chevron affiliate interests in the Azeri Chirag and Deep Water Gunashli (ACG) project and the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) Pipeline,” the company said in a statement to Reuters last week.The U.S. oil and gas major is not breaking from the Big Oil pack when it comes to re-aligning priorities for the next few years—betting big on shorter-term cash-flow generators like the U.S. shale patch and high-grading the global portfolio to boost production at major oil assets for decades to come.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Chevron-Bets-Big-On-Supergiant-Oil-Field.html,"Dec 12, 2018 at 12:21 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Dec 12, 2018",Chevron Bets Big On Supergiant Oil Field
2018-12-12,"OPEC expects demand for its crude oil to average 31.4 million bpd in 2019, down by 100,000 bpd from last month’s forecast, which suggests that the cartel would need to strictly stick to the new production cuts and rely on continued declines from exempt members Iran and Venezuela if it wants to prevent an oversupply.In its closely watched Monthly Oil Market Report, OPEC said on Wednesday that demand for OPEC crude in 2019 was revised down by 100,000 bpd compared to the previous report to stand at 31.4 million bpd—down by 1.0 million bpd lower than the 2018 level.OPEC’s crude oil production in November, on the other hand, averaged 32.97 million bpd, down by 11,000 bpd compared to October, as Saudi Arabia massively increased its oil production to an all-time high, while Iran’s production plunged. Crude oil production in Saudi Arabia surged by 377,000 bpd from to 11.016 million bpd in November, according to OPEC’s secondary sources, while Iranian production plummeted by 380,000 bpd to below 3 million bpd—2.954 million bpd. The other notable increases were in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and in Kuwait, who, together with Saudi Arabia, moved in to anticipate a plunge in Iranian oil exports when U.S. sanctions on Tehran’s oil returned.After Iran, the second-largest oil production slump in November came from Venezuela, whose crude production plunged again, by 52,000 bpd to stand at 1.137 million bpd.  Related: Global Market Turbulence Caps Oil PricesOPEC’s December MOMR was the first in five months which didn’t cut forecasts for the world oil demand growth for 2018 and 2019, although the cartel pointed out that risks are more skewed to the downside for next year. In 2018, global oil demand is seen rising by 1.50 million bpd, while demand in 2019 is seen up by 1.29 million bpd.“Rising trade tensions, monetary tightening and geopolitical challenges are among the issues that skew economic risks even further to the downside in 2019. The upside appears limited, but is mainly resulting from a resolution of trade-related issues and the possibility of slower than currently anticipated monetary policy normalization by G4 central banks,” OPEC said.Non-OPEC oil supply growth for 2019 was revised down by 80,000 bpd to 2.16 million bpd, due to a lower forecast for Canada with Alberta’s mandatory production cut, and a downward supply forecast for the 10 non-OPEC participants in the OPEC+ deal in the first half of 2019.

2018-12-12,"This year’s crude oil futures trading activity is on track for a record high, as trading volumes in China’s new yuan-denominated futures contract is offsetting lower activity in the world’s top benchmarks and most active contracts, Brent and WTI, Reuters reports, citing data from exchanges.The Chinese oil futures, launched in March this year on the ShanghaiInternational Energy Exchange (INE), are still seen mainly as a Chinese market for Chinese traders who don’t trade on market fundamentals. The futures contract struggles to become truly international for market participants, while inconsistent trading volumes are not helping international traders to use the Shanghai futures as a financial hedge.Analysts have also flagged storage costs in China as one of the problems that traders could face in the delivery mechanism of the Chinese oil futures contract. Storage costs in China are much higher than elsewhere. The reason for the higher cost is limited storage capacity availability and the requirement that the cargo be stored at a specific storage facility rather than at any available.Nevertheless, in its first year of launch, the Chinese crude oil futures contract has already taken a 6-percent market share from the most active contracts, WTI and Brent.According to data from exchanges quoted by Reuters, the trading volumes of Brent and WTI dropped to 207.2 million lots of 1,000 barrels each this year through December 10, compared to 220.17 million lots traded last year. Trading volumes in WTI and Brent are set to decline in 2018 for the first time since 2013.But the Shanghai crude oil futures volume trade of 13 million lots until December 10, added to the WTI and Brent trading volumes, will push the oil futures trading globally to a record high this year.“If a new exchange achieves 6 percent market share vs the two incumbents within the first year of trading that’s fairly impressive,” John Driscoll, director of Singapore-based consultancy JTD Energy, told Reuters.To compare, the year in which the Brent futures contract started trading in 1988, Brent took a 3.1-percent share from then-dominant WTI contract.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/China-Pushes-Global-Oil-Trading-To-All-time-High-In-2018.html,"Dec 12, 2018 at 11:52 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Dec 12, 2018",China Pushes Global Oil Trading To All-time High In 2018

2018-12-12,"Crude oil prices remained steady today after the Energy Information Administration confirmed an API estimate of a crude oil inventory draw but a much smaller one than API’s 10.18 million barrels. The authority reported crude oil inventories in the United States had gone down by 1.2 million barrels in the week to December 7, the second weekly draw after a string of weekly increases, after a draw of 7.3 million barrels a week earlier.Oil prices have proved stubborn in the last couple of weeks, moving up and down by too little for the comfort of those who would like to see them higher in light of some strong tailwinds such as OPEC’s agreement to cut production and a major field outage in Libya.Yet it seems the relentless increase in U.S. production is countering these tailwinds. Daily output is likely to have continued rising last week, but the actual numbers will become public at a later time, when the EIA processes production data from companies in the sector.In gasoline, the EIA said inventories had gone up by 2.1 million barrels in the first week of December, with daily production at 10.5 million barrels, versus 9.7 million bpd a week earlier.In distillate fuel, the authority reported a daily production rate of 5.5 million barrels and an inventory decline of 1.5 million barrels. A week earlier, refineries churned out 5.6 million bpd of distillate fuel. In total, refineries last week processed 17.4 million bpd of crude, down from a week earlier.Analysts seem to be beginning to worry the supply cut announced by OPEC+ would not be enough to compensate projections for slowing demand growth as pressure increases on emerging economies.What’s more, Russia said it will reduce its production slowly and gradually, justifying the decision with challenging winter conditions, which means the reduction in global supply will not be felt as quickly as it would have otherwise, serving to relieve some of the worry. Acting fast on these concerns, Reuters reports, money managers have reduced their long positions on both Brent and WTI to three-year lows since the beginning of December.

2018-12-11,"Since Alberta Premier Rachel Notley announced an oil production cut of 325,000 bpd beginning next month, the spot price for Western Canadian Select has gained over 70 percent, Bloomberg reports, adding that the deep discount, at certain times more than US$40 a barrel, had closed by more than half over the last eight days since the cut was announced.The discount could narrow even further as the cut enters into effect in January and producers and refiners negotiate future deliveries. This will in turn benefit Canadian producers who have already begun revising capital expenditure plans for 2019 pressured by the low price of their oil.Last week, Premier Rachel Notley announced that the government of the province will enact an 8.7-percent crude oil production cut to clear excess stockpiles as pipeline bottlenecks and growing volumes of oil being transported by the costlier railway pressured Western Canadian Select to historic lows against the U.S. benchmark, WTI.Premier Notley last week described the situation as “fiscal and economic insanity.” Alberta now has to buy more oil trains—a more dangerous way to transport oil than pipelines—because production is rising inexorably while pipeline capacity remains the same in the face of fierce opposition from environmentalist groups and First Nations against new pipeline projects. The National Energy Board recently said crude oil production in Canada this year will average 4.59 million bpd, up by 22,000 bpd from earlier forecasts.However, plans for 2019 are for reduced spending, Bloomberg notes, as producers feel the bite of low oil prices deeper. The decision to start cutting production would save not just spending, but also jobs because many companies had planned substantial layoffs and reduced spending to a minimum to stay afloat. The lower spending could mean lower production growth, too, which would serve to keep prices higher.

2018-12-10,"With a few days to digest the specifics of the OPEC+ deal, most analysts deem the result a success. But that does not mean that there are no pitfalls left for the oil market.On its face, the numbers are impressive. The group will cut a combined 1.2 million barrels per day (mb/d) beginning in January. “This agreement provided relief to oil markets, with Brent prices up $3/bbl initially, and the accompanying decline in fundamental uncertainty should further help reduce price and implied volatility levels from their recent highs,” Goldman Sachs wrote on Friday after the agreement was announced.OPEC will cut by 0.8 mb/d and non-OPEC will reduce by 0.4 mb/d. Crucially, because the baseline for the cuts is October and not November, the cuts will be significant. “By our calculations, this means that OPEC’s January output will be 31.7mb/d, about 1.2mb/d less than November; a significantly larger fall from current output than the 0.8mb/d headline OPEC cut might suggest,” Standard Chartered wrote in a note. “We have previously suggested that any reduction that takes OPEC output below 32mb/d should be considered bullish.” Saudi Arabia will cut output to 10.2 mb/d in January, down about 0.9 mb/d from November levels.“We think the projected level of output will balance the global market in 2019,” Standard Chartered concluded.Other analysts agreed. “The announced reduction should lead to a relatively balanced global oil market and will likely push Brent and WTI prices back to our respective expected averages of $70/bbl and $59/bbl in 2019,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a note. The investment bank said that the Brent futures market should flip back into a state of backwardation, in which front-month oil futures trade at a premium to longer-dated futures. That implies a bit of bullishness in the market.  Related: Geopolitical Stakes Are Huge On This Tiny IslandThere are also the mandatory cuts from Canada to consider – roughly 325,000 bpd will go offline in January for a period of time until surplus inventories are drained. “Combined with the production cuts in Canada, approx. 1.5 million fewer barrels per day will thus be available to the oil market in early 2019.This should be more or less sufficient to rebalance the oil market next year,” Commerzbank wrote.But that’s not all. Although several troubled countries received exemptions, including Libya, Iran and Nigeria, the odds of further losses from them are relatively high. Goldman Sachs forecasts 0.5 mb/d of declines from those countries.So, we have 1.2 mb/d of reductions from OPEC+, 0.5 mb/d of declining production from the exempted countries, and 325,000 of cuts from Canada. There are still a lot of uncertainties in terms of compliance and unexpected events, but on its face, those reductions together total somewhere close to 2 mb/d.Of course, things aren’t that simple, and Saudi Arabia in particular will likely adjust output levels in response to market conditions. If the losses from Iran, Libya or Nigeria are larger than expected, for instance, Riyadh could put supply back onto the market. As such, supply probably won’t fall by 2 mb/d.  Related: OPEC+ Succeeds, What’s Next For Oil?Moreover, the lack of country-specific production quotas leaves another aspect of uncertainty. Hard data on reductions may be necessary before oil prices can really climb higher. “[W]e reiterate our view that this additional price upside will need to be driven in coming months by evidence of (1) the implementation of the cuts in loadings data, as well as (2) a normalization of excess inventory levels, the stated goals of the agreement,” Goldman Sachs wrote. “The need for this physical evidence emanates from both the surprisingly large surplus of the global oil market in 2H18…as well the absence of a clear picture on the implementation of the cuts.”Nevertheless, the supply picture is set to tighten significantly as we head into 2019. Many oil watchers see a somewhat balanced market in the first half of the year. Supplies could even tighten further if the Trump administration takes a hard line on Iran, with sanctions waivers set to expire in May.The flip side is that the global economy is starting to show wider cracks.

2018-12-10,"OPEC and its non-OPEC partners are set to officially sign a cooperation agreement in March of next year, the UAE’s energy minister Suhail al-Mazrouei said, according to Reuters.The agreement will be officially signed in March in Saudi Arabia, the oil minister said, and will seek to align OPEC with non-OPEC oil producers, most importantly Russia, on matters likely to include achieving market balance—specifically production quotas. The term “market balance” is the new phrase OPEC is using instead of referencing specific oil prices, after OPEC in October steered its members away from any words that may put it at odds with proposed U.S. legislation called the NOPEC Act.OPEC and a group of non-OPEC members reached an agreement on Friday to cut production starting in January 2019. OPEC’s portion of the production cuts was 800,000 bpd, with Saudi Arabia’s accounting for 500,000 bpd of that. The non-OPEC countries agreed to 400,000 bpd of the production cut, with Russia accounting for approximately 230,000 bpd of the 400,000.Russia, for its part, said it would take “months” for that level of cut to be achieved. Likewise, OPEC’s production cuts are unlikely to shrink by 800,000 bpd immediately on January 1st, and will more than likely take months as well.Oil prices ticked upward on Friday, but failed to stay up on Monday, even as OPEC member Libya, exempt from the most recent production cut deal, declared a force majeure on Monday as protests hit the nation’s beleaguered oil industry, shutting in production of its biggest oilfield, Sharara.The idea of making an OPEC/non-OPEC alliance official has been bandied about for some time, most recently by Khalid al-Falih, who said in late October that he hoped to set up an official OPEC+ governing body to preside over oil market coordination.“…we want to sign a new cooperation agreement that is open-ended. That does not expire after 2020 or 2021. We will leave it open,” Al-Falih told TASS at the time, adding that Russia would likely assume the leadership role in this endeavor.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/OPEC-Non-OPEC-Deal-To-Be-Forged-In-March.html,"Dec 10, 2018 at 16:35 | Julianne Geiger","Dec 10, 2018",OPEC+ Deal To Be Forged In March
2018-12-10,"China’s oil thirst continues to grow, despite the impact that U.S. tariffs are starting to have on the world’s second largest economy. On Saturday, preliminary data from China’s General Administration of Customs showed that China’s crude oil imports rose 15.7 percent year-on-year to record high of 10.48 million b/d in November. A report by commodities data provider S&P Global Platts said it was the first time China's monthly crude imports have totaled more than 10 million b/d. The previous record high was 9.64 million b/d reached in April 2018. On a barrels per-day basis, the report added, the inflow represents a 13.9 percent increase from 9.19 million b/d in October.To put that number into perspective, China's 10.48 million bpd of oil imports is just slightly under Saudi Arabia’s record high oil production of 10.72 million b/d in November 2016, just before OPEC and its Russia-led non-OPEC allies started the production cut deal in January 2017.However, if Beijing and Washington can’t agree on a trade deal within the 90-day time frame set last week after President Trump met Chinese President XI Jinping at the G20 summit in Argentina, economic slowdown in China, especially in manufacturing, will ensue, causing a drop in Chinese oil demand, and by extension, global oil demand.Janet Kong, BP’s chief executive of oil trading operations in Asia, told Reuters in late September that ongoing trade tensions between China and the U.S. could slowly hit oil demand in the country. “Going into 2019, I worry about the impact of the U.S.-China trade war, manifesting itself slowly,” she said. “The trade war impact has not really shown up in the data anywhere, but it will show up gradually over time. So the supply shock is very sharp and prompt, while the impact from trade war is boiling over slowly.”Glimmer of hopeNow that there is at least a glimmer of hope that trade tensions can be remedied, and a deal reached that will prevent the U.S. from hiking existing tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent, oil demand could remain robust while the country ramps up procurement of both American oil imports and U.S.-sourced LNG.  Related: OPEC+ Succeeds, What’s Next For Oil?The brief respite in the trade war between the two sides has already allowed a window for Chinese oil companies to start importing U.S. oil again. Sources familiar with knowledge of the matter said last week that Chinese oil trader Unipec will start to buy U.S. oil in March, when the 90-day period reached between Trump and Xi ends.“Chinese buyers who want to buy U.S. crude will rush to import the oil during this window,” a senior executive from Asia’s largest refiner Sinopec said, according to a CNBC report, adding that the oil has to arrive in China before March 1. “Oil prices are low, so it makes economic sense to store some crude as commercial inventories,” said the executive, who asked not to be named.Worst-case scenarioGoing forward, a worst-case scenario for not only China, but for global markets, particularly emerging markets, would be no formal deal reached by March 1, a likely possibility given Trump’s hard line over China’s trade imbalance with the U.S., as well as Beijing’s inability to concede in key areas that U.S. negotiators demand. Numerous U.S. demands are almost impossible for China to agree too, at least in the short term, since it would force the country to reconfigure how it trades and even how it implements government financial and economic policy. Likewise, too much acquiescence by Xi Jinping would weaken his status in the eyes of the Chinese populace just as he continues to build his leadership and power to levels not seen since the reign of Mao Zedong.By Tim Daiss for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Dangers-Of-Chinas-Growing-Oil-Demand.html,"Dec 10, 2018 at 11:47 | Tim Daiss","Dec 10, 2018",The Dangers Of China’s Growing Oil Demand
2018-12-10,"Saudi Arabia could reduce its daily crude oil shipments abroad by as much as 1 million barrels next month, Reuters reports, quoting unnamed sources close to Riyadh. According to them, the move would be motivated by weaker demand due to seasonal patterns in consumption and Saudi Arabia’s commitment to the new production cut agreed last week in Vienna.In total, the sources said, Riyadh will likely export an average 7.3 million bpd in January. This compares with less than 8 million bpd this month, also a decline from November, when the Kingdom exported 8.3 million bpd.Saudi Arabia will once again shoulder the greatest burden of the OPEC-wide cuts, cutting 500,000 bpd from its December production levels, which stand at an average 10.7 million bpd, the same as in October. The cartel and its partners agreed to cut production from October levels, by 2.5 percent for every OPEC member besides Libya, Iran, and Venezuela.Saudi Arabia pumped a record-high of over 11 million bpd in November, after in June, the Kingdom agreed with Russia and other OPEC members to start increasing production again as Brent soared over US$80 a barrel to the disgruntlement of large importers such as India and the United States.In exports, Saudi Arabia’s hit their highest in 20 months in September, according to data by the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI) database, which collects self-reported oil figures from 114 countries. The Kingdom’s production in early November probably hit the highest on record, on the back of high customer requests made in early October when the market feared a hefty loss of Iranian supply last month.Over September, October and November, however, Riyadh gradually cut shipments to the United States in a bid to prop up fast-falling prices. This month the cuts will continue, globally, due to weak seasonal demand.

2018-12-07,"Oil prices spiked on Friday on news from Vienna.OPEC+ managed to pull off an eleventh-hour agreement, checking all the boxes after a contentious set of meetings. There were a lot of competing interests at play, but the agreement offers a little bit of everything, enough for all parties to walk away satisfied.The headliner is the 1.2 million-barrel-per-day (mb/d) cut beginning in January, with a review scheduled for April. OPEC will shoulder 800,000 bpd of the total, and non-OPEC countries will take on the other 400,000 bpd. The baseline used to measure the cuts is October production levels.The cut is larger than some analysts had expected, especially given the rumors swirling on Thursday about a cut of around 1 mb/d. In fact, one could argue that the group cleverly managed market expectations, lowering them on Thursday only to surprise the market with a larger cut on Friday. Prior to the meeting 1.2 mb/d might have been considered a middle-of-the-road cut, but after the seemingly tumultuous set of meetings on Thursday and early Friday, a 1.2 mb/d cut ends up looking like a highly successful result.Iran had held up the talks early Friday. Saudi Arabia pushed for them to agree to a symbolic cut, an odd position given that Iran’s output at this point is far below capacity and far below its prior ceiling. Iran, with good reason, argued that it should not have to sign on to any cuts, especially since sanctions are likely going to curtail output even further in the months ahead.The rumors on Friday were that the holdup could sink a deal, but that was never going to be the case. It’s extremely hard to imagine Saudi Arabia walking away from a deal that included meaningful cuts from other producers just because Iran wouldn’t symbolically cut their output.  Related: Oil Prices Hold Steady As U.S., Canadian Oil Rig Count Take Steep DiveUltimately, the result was a quirky one. All countries appear to be participants in the deal, but there won’t be country-specific quotas. Iran did not receive an official “exemption,” some OPEC officials argued, even as the Iranians claimed they did. Other officials said that there would be “special considerations.” This point is a matter of splitting hairs – Iran’s production is likely to fall in the coming months; it doesn’t really matter what they call it. That’s also why this issue was not going to be the thing that sunk the entire deal.Oil prices spiked on the news, with Brent up around 5 percent immediately after the agreement was announced.Russia, as expected, played a pivotal role in the deal, and its willingness to go along with a larger-than-expected cut was the key factor in the 1.2 mb/d reduction (although Russia’s precise contribution was not known at the time of this writing).The deal can be called a success for two reasons. First, it takes 1.2 mb/d off of the market beginning in January, which will go a long way to erasing the surplus. Second, it removes a great deal of uncertainty about what to expect in the near future. Oil prices have been all over the map in the last few months, with Saudi production surging at a time when U.S. shale was also defying expectations. Now, it’s reasonable to assume that any surplus or deficit won’t be so large as to lead to dramatic price swings, at least in the short run.  Related: Could Iraq Be The Next OPEC Member To Exit?However, the one remaining piece of uncertainty is how, or if, the U.S. government will react. President Trump has repeatedly demanded low oil prices, and tweeted as recently as Wednesday to that effect. Typically, OPEC would not be all that sensitive to Trump’s demands, but Saudi Arabia is reeling after the international outrage over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. A bipartisan movement in Washington is upping the pressure on Riyadh, and Trump has been one of the few friends Saudi Arabia has left.If oil prices rise too much, Trump might lash out and dump the Saudis, although what that means in practice is very much unclear. Due to extreme budgetary pressure from low oil prices, Saudi Arabia had no choice but to risk Trump’s ire and push for meaningfully supply curbs.For now, OPEC+ is likely patting themselves on the back. They reached an agreement that is mostly acceptable to everyone, oil prices are up, the surplus will narrow significantly and uncertainty is greatly diminished.Notably, the agreement calls for a review in April. The timing is not coincidental – U.S. waivers granted to eight countries importing Iranian oil expire in May. By April, everyone will know much more about what direction Washington intends to go in, and how much oil Iran will lose. If Iranian exports are rapidly falling to zero, OPEC+ would have time to unwind the production cuts.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/OPEC-Succeeds-Whats-Next-For-Oil.html,"Dec 07, 2018 at 16:49 | Nick Cunningham","Dec 07, 2018","OPEC+ Succeeds, What’s Next For Oil?"
2018-12-07,"This week the United States Geological Survey (USGS) announced a groundbreaking oil and gas discovery in West Texas’ Permian Basin. According to the organization’s recent press release, a whopping 46.3 billion barrels of oil, 281 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 20 billion barrels of natural gas liquids are now believed to lie untapped in the Wolfcamp Shale and overlying Bone Spring Formation area of Texas and New Mexico’s Permian Basin.Major players in the energy industry already have a significant presence in Wolfcamp and Bone Spring, including Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Pioneer Natural Resources Co. It was already well known and well documented that these fields were remarkably fertile grounds for oil extraction, but the jaw-dropping extent of the new figures released this week by the USGS has made the massive crude and shale reserves of the Permian Basin freshly headline-worthy. The figures in this week’s press release are in fact, in the case of Wolfcamp Shale, more than double the previous resource assessment.(Click to enlarge) Source: USGSThe USGS assessed the area more than two years ago in 2016, and has officially determined that it contained the largest estimated quantity of continuous oil in the entire United States. ""Christmas came a few weeks early this year,"" said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke in response to these momentous figures. ""American strength flows from American energy, and as it turns out, we have a lot of American energy. Before this assessment came down, I was bullish on oil and gas production in the United States. Now, I know for a fact that American energy dominance is within our grasp as a nation.""  Related: Is This The Next Big Petrochemical Hub In The U.S.?The USGS qualifies the figures of their massive discovery as consisting of undiscovered, technically recoverable resources, which they define as, ""those [resources] that are estimated to exist based on geologic knowledge and already established production, while technically recoverable resources are those that can be produced using currently available technology and industry practices. Whether or not it is profitable to produce these resources has not been evaluated.""The continued productivity and massive untapped resources present in the Permian Basin are particularly vital to the United States energy industry, in a time that most shale wells are in steep decline after years of record booms and cheap crude-flooded markets. Now, in addition to this stunning discovery from the USGS, there is even further hope that there are still additional technically recoverable resources lying in wait, yet to be discovered.Dr. Jim Reilly, the Director of USGS, a facet of the U.S. Department of Interior, highlighted how remarkable the discovery was in the larger context of the industry. “In the 1980’s, during my time in the petroleum industry, the Permian and similar mature basins were not considered viable for producing large new recoverable resources. Today, thanks to advances in technology, the Permian Basin continues to impress in terms of resource potential. The results of this most recent assessment and that of the Wolfcamp Formation in the Midland Basin in 2016 are our largest continuous oil and gas assessments ever released.” Reilly stressed, “Knowing where these resources are located and how much exists is crucial to ensuring both our energy independence and energy dominance.”Additionally, these discoveries come at a particularly opportune time for West Texas, as a major injection of funding has just been provided toward infrastructure the West Texas area via a federal grant supported by U.S. Senator John Cornyn. The grant, which comes from a program led by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (B.U.I.L.D.) will direct money to infrastructure projects in Winkler, Glasscock and Reagan Counties.The recent discovery and continued investment in the Permian Basin shows that the industry continues to be bullish in West Texas, and with good reason, despite the volatility of the oil industry as a whole. While other major fields continue to decline in production, the Permian Basin has managed to stay above the fray and certainly shows no sign of slowing.By Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Real-Implications-Of-The-New-Permian-Estimates.html,"Dec 07, 2018 at 16:37 | Haley Zaremba","Dec 07, 2018",The Real Implications Of The New Permian Estimates

Prior to the comment from the Saudi’s, the market had been pricing in a cut in output of up to 1.4 million barrels per day.The daily chart is set up for a breakout to the upside and we have identified what we believe is the trigger point for an acceleration to the upside.

2018-12-07,"The U.S. Geological Survey has revised the technically recoverable reserves in the Wolfcamp Basin, in the Permian shale play, to 46.3 billion barrels of crude and 281 trillion cu ft of natural gas. That’s up from 20 billion barrels of crude and 16 trillion cu ft of gas in recoverable reserves in late 2016.It’s worth noting, however, the new estimate also includes the Bone Spring formation that makes up part of the Delaware Basin in the Permian. This is the first time this formation is included in the USGS oil and gas reserves assessment.Recoverable reserves are calculated based not just on exploration results and geology but also on the price level that makes the oil and gas commercially viable for extraction. The USGS carried out its revision earlier this year, so it must have reflected the improvement in oil prices, notably West Texas Intermediate that has now largely disappeared, sparking worry about the sustainability of production growth, which has been steady throughout the year.The national total hit 11.7 million bpd last month, an all-time high and also the highest in the world and the Permian was the major driver behind this growth. It is the shale play that produces the most oil and also boasts the fastest rate of production growth: in November the Permian yielded 3.63 million bpd of crude and the Energy Information Administration expects this to rise further to 3.695 million bpd this month.So, the Permian is already a star, but now it will shine more brightly. The USGS numbers mean it is the largest single reservoir of oil and gas in the United States and one of the largest on a global scale.  Related: U.S. Becomes Net Oil Exporter For First Time In 75 YearsThe Albuquerque Journal quoted the head of the state’s Oil and Gas Association as saying “Even for someone who understands the resources and potential of the Permian Basin, I can’t help but be surprised by the sheer enormity of what the USGS has reported. Ryan Flynn added “The Permian resources shared by New Mexico and Texas make this area one of the most important places in the world in terms of oil production.”While this is true, this rush to the Permian, aptly dubbed Permania, has led to some problems, namely price discounts as there are not enough pipelines to get the product to refiners and export markets. However, these problems are being addressed already and the Permania looks like it will only intensify unless prices slump below US$50 a barrel for WTI.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/USGS-Doubles-Permian-Oil-Reserves-Estimate.html,"Dec 07, 2018 at 13:36 | Irina Slav","Dec 07, 2018",Permian Oil Reserves May Be Twice As Big As We Thought

2018-12-07,"Libya’s crude oil production has fallen by about 300,000 bpd since the start of this month on the back of oil export terminal shutdowns amid harsh weather and full storage tanks, Kallanish Energy reports, citing a statement from the National Oil Corporation.Libya has been suffering severe rainfall that closed all its oil export terminals along with roads and the airport in Benghazi, Reuters reported earlier this week. Flooding and high waves on the coast made the docking of tankers impossible, stranding more oil in storage.Earlier in the week, a source close to NOC told S&P Global Platts the oil terminals shutdown and the limited storage capacity would reduce production by half that much. Storage capacity is critically full at the Zawiya terminal, which serves the Sharara oil field, according to the source, who added that production at Sharara is expected to be reduced by 50 percent as of Thursday morning local time. This is Libya’s largest producing field.The storage capacity problem surfaces as Libya tries to ramp up production closer to pre-war levels. As of November, the North African country pumped crude at a rate of a little over 1 million bpd. Libya hopes to score an exemption from the OPEC-wide oil production cuts that are currently being discussed with Russia in Vienna as it seeks to boost its oil revenues after years of civil war that has crippled its oil-dependent economy.OPEC’s intention to resume cutting came at the wrong time for Libya, which earlier this year suffered several production outages and in July output fell to just 660,000 bpd of crude thanks to field and pipeline blockades and clashes between LNA and opposing groups at the oil terminals. Just a month earlier, its production had fallen to half a million bpd. As of late November, Libya was producing 1.3 million bpd and plans were to boost this to 1.6 million bpd.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Libyan-Oil-Production-Falls-300000-Bpd-In-December.html,"Dec 07, 2018 at 09:30 | Irina Slav","Dec 07, 2018","Libyan Oil Production Falls 300,000 Bpd In December"
2018-12-06,"The United States became a net oil exporter last week for the first time in 75 years, and even if it is likely to be for just one week, the achievement highlights the increasing global influence of the soaring U.S. crude oil production.According to Bloomberg and data from the American Petroleum Institute, the United States had been a net oil importer since 1949.In the week to November 30, however, the weekly U.S. net imports of crude oil and petroleum products were at minus 211,000 bpd—meaning that the U.S. was a net exporter of that amount, according to data from the EIA.So far in 2018, the U.S. net oil imports have averaged around 2 million bpd, while the record net oil imports of 14.370 million bpd was set in November 2005.In crude oil only, U.S. crude oil exports surged to a record high of 3.203 million bpd last week, as oil production also soars to record highs. According to weekly data from the EIA, U.S. crude oil production kept at a record 11.7 million bpd throughout November, although these numbers are likely to come off a bit in the monthly estimates. Production at 11.7 million bpd is more than what each of Russia and Saudi Arabia pumped in November, although the Saudis are also expected to have reached record highs in their production last month.Saudi Arabia, as leader of OPEC, and Russia, its key partner in the production cut deal, are in the midst of deliberating new oil production cuts to rebalance an oversupplied market.U.S. President Donald Trump continues to call on OPEC to keep oil prices low, because “The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!”.But a no-deal or an underwhelming agreement on Friday could send oil prices further down, potentially hurting production growth in the U.S. shale patch.

2018-12-06,"As oil markets hold their breath for OPEC+’s announcement of the final production cuts to take place starting next year, the Energy Information Administration served a nice surprise to oil bulls by reporting an inventory draw in crude oil of 7.3 million barrels for the week to November 30.The report came two days after the American Petroleum Institute disappointed bulls with an estimated inventory build of 5.36 million barrels for the same week, pushing WTI prices down closer to US$50 a barrel.The EIA said refineries processed 17.5 million barrels of crude daily last week, producing 9.7 million bpd of gasoline and 5.6 million bpd of distillate fuel. A week earlier, refineries processed 17.6 million bpd, with gasoline production at 10.2 million bpd and distillate fuel production at 5.5 million bpd.Gasoline inventories last week added 1.7 million barrels, with distillate inventories rising by 3.8 million barrels. This compared with an 800,000-barrel decline in gasoline inventories and a 2.6-million-barrel rise in distillate fuel inventories a week earlier.Oil has been on the slide this week, pressured by uncertainties surrounding this round of OPEC+ production cuts and the surprise announcement by Qatar that it was leaving the cartel starting in January. There has been speculation that Iraq, OPEC’s second-largest producer may follow as it cannot really afford to reduce its production.A stock market dip accelerated the oil price drop, but trading was not particularly dynamic ahead of the OEPC meeting in Vienna. The cartel will release a statement later in the day, but Russia has yet to have its say, which will take place tomorrow. Its position is considered once again the maker or breaker of the cut deal, although the prevailing mood is positive, with a high degree of certainty that an agreement to reduce crude oil supply will be reached.At the time of writing, Brent crude traded at US$59.49 a barrel, with West Texas Intermediate at US$50.74 a barrel, both down since opening.UPDATE: OPEC failed to reveal a solid agreement in Vienna after hours of meetings.

2018-12-06,"The joint ministerial committee of OPEC and non-OPEC ministers that oversaw the production cuts from 2017 and the first half of this year has once again recommended that the cartel and its partners reduce crude oil production, TASS reports, citing the energy minister of Oman, Mohammed bin Hamad Al Rumhy.""We just agreed on the reduction. Actually, the level of reduction will be discussed in the next two days,"" Al Rumhy told media in Vienna. Later today, however, OPEC will come out with a statement on the topic that will reveal its final position on the cuts amid a lot of internal disagreement.Tomorrow, Russia and several other non-OPEC producers will join the talks and the amount of the cuts—if agreed—will be specified. Al Rumhy said he believed OPEC+ could reduce its combined output by 1 million bpd. The agreement will be in force for six months, the minister also said.Talk about cuts began last month, initiated by Saudi Arabia amid slumping oil prices. Analysts projected cuts in the range of 1 to 1.4 million bpd but most acknowledged this time it might be harder for the Kingdom to get everyone on board. Iraq is not the only one that can’t really afford the cuts: Iran has stated it will not discuss its production quota while under sanctions and Russia has made it clear it was fine with prices where they are. Yet president Putin said at the G20 meeting cooperation between Russia and Saudi Arabia would continue, which suggested Russian oil companies will join the cuts.If Saudi Arabia and Russia prevail in the discussions, the only issue would be the size of the cut unless Iraq decides to quit the cartel altogether, as Barclays’ David Cohen suggested in a chat with CNBC. If that happens, whatever cuts are agreed would have about the same effect on prices as the entry into effect of U.S. sanctions against Iran after market players had months to prepare for them.UPDATE: OPEC failed to reveal a solid agreement in Vienna after hours of meetings.

2018-12-05,"The oil market is understandably in a state of suspense this week, eagerly fixated on the events unfolding in Vienna. But regardless of what happens, the market is in for a potentially rough ride as we head into 2019, with a series of economic headwinds threatening demand.The S&P 500 is set to peak, corporate earnings are expected to slow, inflation could edge up and U.S. fiscal stimulus is set to fade, according to a recent 2019 forecast from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The report lays out a series of predictions for next year, many of which center around global economic uncertainty.The main themes of the report are of a slowing economy in the U.S., combined with already slow growth elsewhere. Global GDP growth is expected to dip from 3.8 percent this year to 3.6 percent in 2019.In Europe, political and economic stress continues. France has recently been rocked by fuel tax protests. Brexit negotiations are entering a critical phase and Italy is fighting with Brussels over its budget deficit. Germany saw its GDP contract in the third quarter, as did Japan.China is also facing slower growth. The trade war could flare up once again after the much-heralded Trump-Xi truce expires in three months. In fact, as the details on the most recent trade ceasefire faced more scrutiny, the deal started to look a little hollow. Trump took to twitter, perhaps after he realized that China’s concession were not rock solid, and said that he was “a Tariff Man,” warning them to follow through.  Related: New Breakthrough Will Change How Oil Reserves Are MeasuredUltimately, the prospect of a renewed trade war is alive and well, and along with it, downside risks to the global economy.“The BofA Merrill Lynch Research team is bearish stocks, bonds, and the U.S. dollar; bullish cash and commodities; and long on volatility,” the investment bank said in its report regarding the 2019 outlook.One of the key backdrops for the global economy in 2019 will be “an unprecedented level of global monetary policy divergence as the U.S. Federal Reserve continues to hike interest rates and other major central banks don’t,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a report. The Fed has been steadily hiking interest rates while the European Central Bank has held off.The dollar has gained significantly this year as a result, which has ultimately spread volatility throughout emerging markets, weakening currencies and contributing to a flare up in financial stress. Many breathed a sigh of relief when U.S. Fed chairman Jerome Powell seemed to revise his outlook recently, noting that interest rates are close to what the central bank views as “neutral.” Just a month ago he said that rates were very far from neutral. The slight change in wording suggests the Fed could take a less hawkish view on monetary policy, which could be good for growth and may support a weaker dollar.As such, it’s not all bad news. BofAML says that emerging markets are so oversold that they could see a big rebound in 2019, helped along by a weaker dollar.  Related: Oil Output Cuts May Be Coming But Don’t Bet on ItNevertheless, the economic headwinds look much more formidable heading into next year than they did at the start of 2018.The implications for the oil market are profound. OPEC+ is trying to get a handle on a burgeoning supply glut, which has been made worse by downward revisions in demand. Still, global oil demand has been affected much less than might be implied by the bout of economic volatility that has unfolded recently. The IEA has twice revised its 2018 figures down, but only by around 200,000 bpd. In its November Oil Market Report, the agency noted that “a deteriorating outlook for the global economy is largely offset by the fall in Brent crude oil prices.” In other words, oil prices fell because a worsening economy implied lower demand, but lower prices themselves helped keep demand aloft.As a result, oil prices might not necessarily fall from current levels even though the economy could take a turn for the worse. “We forecast Brent and WTI crude oil prices to average $70 and $59 per barrel, respectively in 2019,” BofAML concluded.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-This-The-Most-Crucial-Factor-For-Oil-In-2019.html,"Dec 05, 2018 at 16:10 | Nick Cunningham","Dec 05, 2018",Is This The Most Crucial Factor For Oil In 2019?
2018-12-05,"The explosive production growth in the U.S. shale patch has surprised even the most optimistic forecasters, but the huge jumps in output belies and obscures the financial state of the industry, which is a bit more complicated than the production figures might suggest.Shale companies scrambled to cut costs during the oil market downturn between 2014 and 2017, and they successfully lowered their breakeven prices significantly. When OPEC+ agreed on its initial production cut deal, which started at the beginning of 2017, the higher prices that resulted from the agreement allowed U.S. shale to rebound in a big way. Surging production over the past two years suggested that the shale industry was stronger than ever.This year was supposed to be the year that the money started rolling in – with cost cuts in hand and higher oil prices lifting all boats, shale drillers were supposed to be in the clear. But profits have been elusive.To be sure, some companies have posted significant earnings. The oil majors, in particular, are earning more money than they have in a long time. But the bulk of the shale industry is still struggling. According to the Wall Street Journal, the 30 largest shale companies earned a rather marginal $1.7 billion combined in 2017.The latest meltdown in prices, however, puts a lot in the industry right back into hot water. The problem is that despite boasts of low breakeven prices, many shale companies have failed to take a comprehensive look at the all-in costs of producing oil, as the Wall Street Journal points out.  Related: Is This The Next Disaster For Canadian Drillers?It wasn’t uncommon over the last few years to hear shale executives brag about how their wells were profitable even with oil under $40 per barrel. But often those figures didn’t include the cost of land acquisition, or transportation. Or, while individual wells might make a return, the company was ignoring the cost of producing in other less desirable locations. At the end of the day, much of the industry was not turning a profit, even when oil prices traded north of $50 per barrel.According to the Wall Street Journal and consulting firm R.S. Energy Group, true breakeven prices that incorporate costs such as land acquisition come out to about $51 per barrel in the Permian, $57 per barrel in the Eagle Ford, and $64 in the Bakken.That means that the latest downturn in oil prices is likely putting the industry under strain. WTI is now trading in the low-$50s per barrel.On top of that, the pipeline bottlenecks are having a negative effect on finances, even though the robust production figures reported by the EIA suggest that the constraints have only had a marginal impact on production.There are conflicting signals on how much the Permian, for instance, is seeing a slowdown because of pipeline issues. “The widely-predicted movement of activity and capex out of the Permian Basin while off-take capacity is constrained is yet to materialise,” Standard Chartered analysts wrote in a note, adding that “oil rigs in the Bakken have only risen by six y/y, Eagle Ford oil activity is up 13, while the combined Delaware and Midland Basin oil rig count is up 95 y/y.”  Related: Iran: Oil To Fall To $40 If OPEC Fails To Reach DealBut Schlumberger, the largest oilfield services company in the world, said this week that it expects drilling activity to slow down significantly in the fourth quarter, with sales for its services in North America expected to drop by 15 percent, compared to the prior quarter. The recent downturn in prices is hurting drillers, which comes at a time when budgets are mostly exhausted anyway.“We are seeing a significantly larger drop in activity than we expected, which is leading to a larger drop in pricing than we anticipated,” Patrick Schorn, executive vice president at Schlumberger said in an investor presentation, according to Bloomberg. “We continue to see the weakening of the hydraulic fracturing market as temporary, with the expectation of a gradual recovery taking place over the first half of 2019.”The financial strain may also be a hiccup that the industry can overcome. Wall Street has showered drillers with cash over the past decade or so. The near-zero interest rate environment allowed for a debt-fueled drilling boom. In other words, unprofitable production barely slowed down the industry in years past. It’s not clear that the latest fall in prices would seriously deter more drilling, even if companies are not making a profit.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Shale-Struggles-As-Oil-Prices-Drop.html,"Dec 05, 2018 at 14:02 | Nick Cunningham","Dec 05, 2018",U.S. Shale Struggles As Oil Prices Drop

This would mark the withdrawal of U.S. companies from the Azeri oil industry a full 25 years after western majors, including five U.S. firms, signed what is known as “the Contract of the Century” in the former Soviet republic.  As part of a re-prioritization of its global operations, ExxonMobil is looking to sell its minority stake in the giant Azeri oil field Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) in the Caspian Sea, hoping to obtain as much as US$2 billion for its interest, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing banking and industry sources.Chevron, for its part, is reviewing its global asset portfolio and has “decided to initiate the process of marketing, with a view to a potential sale, of our Chevron affiliate interests in the Azeri Chirag and Deep Water Gunashli (ACG) project and the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) Pipeline,” the company said in a statement to Reuters.Chevron has an 8.9 percent stake in the BTC pipeline, which carries oil from the ACG field and condensate from Shah Deniz across Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey.Chevron also owns a 9.6-percent stake in the ACG oil field, and is currently the third-largest shareholder behind field operator BP and Azeri state firm SOCAR. Exxon holds 6.8 percent in the field, while the other foreign partners in the venture include the operator BP, INPEX, Equinor, TP, ITOCHU, and ONGC Videsh.

The country and a consortium of foreign oil companies signed a 30-year deal in 1994 to develop the field. Exxon was part of the initial group of companies that signed the contract with Azerbaijan, which also featured four other U.S. companies at the time— Amoco, Unocal, Pennzoil, and McDermott. Last year, the deal was extended to 2050.Production at the giant Azeri field averaged 596,000 bpd in the first half of 2018, accounting for around 75 percent of Azerbaijan’s total oil production.The field has received U.S. support, and U.S. companies have been involved in its development as it was seen as a giant resource that could undermine Russia’s dominance in European energy supply. But the promise of possible new finds near the giant field never materialized, and Azerbaijan tightened its grip on energy assets via SOCAR.Approached by Reuters, Exxon spokeswoman Julie King declined to comment on the company’s plans for Azerbaijan, just saying that “we don’t comment on market rumors or speculation.”In recent years, Exxon has shifted its global focus to offshore exploration in Guyana, where it has found major reserves of oil—including a tenth find announced earlier this week—with plans to start producing from the Liza Phase 1 development of up to 120,000 barrels oil per day by early 2020.  Related: Iran: Oil To Fall To $40 If OPEC Fails To Reach DealAccording to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, the Liza Complex now best compares to Brazil’s Lula-Iracema, one of the world’s largest deepwater finds. Guyana can “easily become the fourth largest oil producing nation in Latin America by the next decade, with chances to outperform the countries preceding it. If Venezuela and Mexico fail to address production declines, Guyana could quickly surpass them to number two,” said Luiz Hayum, research analyst with WoodMac’s Latin America upstream oil and gas team.Chevron, for its part, is involved in giant oil projects in another country on the Caspian Sea, Kazakhstan, and holds major stakes in two giant oil fields—Tengiz and Karachaganak.Despite different priorities globally, both U.S. supermajors are betting big on their home shale patch, building up acreage and stakes and ramping up oil production in the Permian.Chevron reported its highest ever quarterly oil production of 2.96 million barrels of net oil-equivalent in Q3, thanks to rising Permian production.Exxon, for its part, reported increased Q3 production compared to Q2, thanks to the Permian.“We’re pleased with the increase in production from the second quarter of 2018 recognizing it reflects contributions from just one of our key growth areas, the Permian,” chairman and CEO Darren Woods said in the earnings release.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Oil-Majors-To-Break-The-Contract-Of-The-Century.html,"Dec 05, 2018 at 12:49 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Dec 05, 2018",U.S. Oil Majors To Break “The Contract Of The Century”
2018-12-05,"Every once in a while, a new technological development shakes up a conservative sector. In the oil and gas industry, the shale revolution has changed the business in multiple ways. The U.S. has been transformed from one of the world’s leading oil importers into the world’s largest producer of oil and gas. Fracking in the Permian basin has created bottlenecks as the existing infrastructure cannot cope with rising production. Producers are not able to get all the oil and gas to customers, creating a price differential with the WTI benchmark. On average, shale oil producers in the Permian basin receive $10 to $13 dollars less for each barrel compared to WTI levels.It is not only energy companies that are benefitting from rising production, pipeline manufacturers are also reaping the rewards. Globally, the U.S. ranks no. 1 in pipelines planned and under construction. Most of the oil and gas pipelines planned for 2019 and 2020 will connect the Permian Basin with consumers and export terminals in the Gulf of Mexico. However, the additional capacity will create another problem by moving the bottleneck from transportation to the facilities on the coast.Pipelines and more pipelinesWith the need for additional pipelines rising fast, Texas has become the epicenter of a booming industry. The Lone Star State produces 40 percent of the national oil production, production that the Energy Department estimates to be 11.6 million barrels per day. In Texas, companies are investing $40 billion in building or expanding 10,000 miles of pipeline, which is enough pipeline to reach from West Texas to China.Until the end of 2019, at least three large pipelines will be put into action, raising capacity by an additional 2 million barrels per day. However, this comes at a time when existing facilities have a limited unused capacity. The added pipeline infrastructure will exceed the available capacity at export facilities by a large margin. Several additional facilities have been announced, each in a different stadium of planning. However, it is likely that not all plans will come to fruition.  Related: OPEC Oil Exports Jump Ahead Of Meeting(Click to enlarge)According to James Teague, CEO of Enterprise Products, ""anyone can build a terminal, but it's what's behind that terminal that determines its success."" In other words, success in the terminal business is as much about securing the barrels as it is about shipping them out. Some companies have an edge due to two reasons: early planning such as Trafigura or those with interests in production, transportation, and the terminals itself such Enbridge Inc.Determining successTrafigura is, to date, the only company that has submitted a formal permit application to build a deep-water terminal in the Corpus Christi area. Being the first to complete a facility would diminish the necessity of additional terminals as these facilities don’t come cheap - costing in the range of billions. However, being the first to apply doesn’t determine whether you’re also the first to finish the facility as environmentalists are trying to delay construction.Furthermore, the rate of success is also determined by supplies and the designated route of pipelines. The majority of export infrastructure is located in two regions: Houston and Corpus Christi. Companies in these areas are battling to become the country’s largest and most important location for moving American oil overseas. Each region shipped out more than $7 billion in crude during the first nine months of this year compared to just one billion two years ago.

First, the trade war negatively affected the global economy, which in turn reduced the growing demand for oil. The positive news coming from the sidelines of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires has improved the outlook for global energy demand, at least for now.Furthermore, the construction of pipelines and export facilities requires buyers to make investments profitable. China is the largest growth market for oil and gas. Beijing could agree to buy more American energy to reduce the trade deficit. However, the truce of the G20 summit is not a peace agreement. Therefore, American energy companies could be facing a bumpy year in 2019.By Vanand Meliksetian for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-US-Pipeline-Industry-Is-Booming.html,"Dec 05, 2018 at 10:48 | Vanand Meliksetian","Dec 05, 2018",The U.S. Pipeline Industry Is Booming
2018-12-05,"OPEC’s meeting this Thursday in Vienna may not lead to an agreement to start reducing production, Iran’s OPEC governor said, as quoted by S&P Global Platts. Hossein Kazempour Ardebili said there were tensions between members of the cartel, with some unhappy about others’ large production increases in recent months.""The cooperation agreement is unlikely to be renewed,"" Ardebili said. “At least some member states will not join it, in which case any renewal will be out of the question.""Increasing the heat further, the official said some OPEC members might even decide to follow in Qatar’s footsteps and leave OPEC altogether.The reason, according to Ardebili, is their limited production capacity, especially spare capacity. ""Some producers have limited production capacity. Therefore, they may be faced with lower demand for production, while on the other hand, they lack any spare capacity for increased production, if need be,"" he said, adding ""That strengthens the possibility of exit by minor member states. That is not impossible.""Qatar, which produces around 600,000 bpd, announced its decision to leave OPEC earlier this week, citing a focus on natural gas and maintaining its number-one position as gas exporter in the world.The cartel is meeting tomorrow to discuss production cuts that may range from 1 to 1.4 million bpd. Russia and another nine non-members will join the talks. There have been reports citing Moscow officials that while last time Russia did not mind its cut quota, which stood at 300,000 bpd out of total cuts of 1.8 million bpd, this time the country may not be so willing to cut so much.“We think 1 million bpd (cuts) is more realistic, not 1.4 million bpd ... But who is going to do this is another question,” the source said, as quoted by Reuters.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Iran-Dont-Count-On-A-New-OPEC-Deal.html,"Dec 05, 2018 at 10:31 | Irina Slav","Dec 05, 2018",Iran: Don’t Count On A New OPEC Deal
2018-12-04,"The OPEC+ meeting is set to kickoff, with a press conference scheduled for Thursday afternoon in Vienna. While there seems to be a vague outline of an agreement in hand, there is still quite a bit of uncertainty about what might come out of the meeting.Saudi oil minister Khalid al-Falih injected a bit more uncertainty into the market with his comments in a Tuesday interview with Bloomberg. He said that Russia supports production restraints “in principle,” but that it would be “premature” to say what specifically they might agree to. He even said that OPEC+ still needs to “figure out what needs to be done and by how much.”While there is always a bit of jawboning and word games ahead of any OPEC meeting, the comments suggest that there is still some disagreement over the specifics. “We need to get together and listen to our colleagues, hear about their views on supply and demand and their projections of their own countries’ production,” al-Falih said. “The next road to cross is whether all countries are willing to come on board and contribute to that cut.”Saudi Arabia’s inclination is to cut aggressively, but it also does not want to anger U.S. President Donald Trump, who has bailed the Saudis out on the Khashoggi affair. Al-Falih was notably more circumspect regarding a production cut on Tuesday than he was only a few weeks ago, when he announced that Saudi Arabia would unilaterally lower exports beginning in December. Between then and now the U.S. Senate passed a bill ending American support for the Saudi war in Yemen, significantly upping the pressure on Saudi Arabia not to cut by too much.  Related: What Crashing Refining Margins Mean For Oil MarketsMeanwhile, Riyadh still needs to convince Moscow to some degree. Even though Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he was on board, Bloomberg reports that Russia only wants to cut output by 150,000 bpd, a rather modest amount, which would mean more heavy lifting by Saudi Arabia to balance the market. Russia appears willing to go along with some sort of reduction, but it also does not feel the same urgency as the Saudis, particularly because of the dynamics of how its currency fluctuates with oil prices, making lower prices much less painful compared to Saudi Arabia.Even if Saudi Arabia and Russia are not quite on the same page regarding the size of the cut and how to share the reductions, most analysts see some sort of deal emerging from Thursday’s meeting. In fact, even though Russia is not a price hawk in the same way that Saudi Arabia is, Moscow can gain from the damaged relationship between Washington and Riyadh.“Having stayed largely silent on the Khashoggi case, Moscow has an opportunity to strengthen relations with Riyadh further if it accommodates Saudi Arabia,” Torbjorn Soltvedt, politics principal analyst for Verisk Maplecroft wrote in a note to clients. “An OPEC+ agreement led by Saudi Arabia and Russia that openly defies the US is unlikely; but we believe Riyadh has a good chance of securing the participation of Moscow in a flexible supply cut agreement.”  Related: Australians Create Battery From WasteSoltvedt said that the consultancy’s “basecase scenario is a de-facto Saudi-led cut with Russian participation, but a flexible agreement that shies away from specific targets.” Individual countries may not have specific targets; instead a collective target could be the main takeaway.Flexibility is important, Verisk Maplecroft argues, because the oil market could undergo another dramatic shift in just a few months’ time. “Another benefit of this approach is that it reduces the likelihood of another OPEC U-turn if the Trump administrations decides to not renew Iran waivers expiring in May,” Soltvedt of Verisk Maplecroft wrote. “With around 1 million bpd of Iranian oil in the balance, a rigid OPEC agreement in the traditional mold risks quickly being overtaken by events in 2019.”The Trump administration – mainly Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor John Bolton – are eager to tighten the screws on Iran. In October, as the U.S. was in the midst of preparing to issue waivers for eight countries importing oil from Iran, the oil market looked precariously tight. The ensuing price crash – no doubt made worse by the waivers themselves – has revealed a market much looser than expected.That means that by May, the Trump administration will likely want to let most of those waivers expire. The result could be much more Iranian supply knocked offline. Saudi Arabia and Russia need to account for this possibility at Thursday’s meeting in Vienna. That means, as Verisk Maplecroft argues, a production cut, but one that can be easily rolled back should events require it.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Most-Likely-Outcome-Of-The-OPEC-Meeting.html,"Dec 04, 2018 at 17:23 | Nick Cunningham","Dec 04, 2018",The Most Likely Outcome Of The OPEC Meeting
2018-12-04,"A fractured OPEC is meeting later this week to discuss a deal to cut oil production—yet again—to rebalance the market and lift oil prices that have recently slipped to below most of the cartel members’ budget-balance points.OPEC needs a unanimous vote to pass decisions such as curtailing production. Yet, Iran—one of OPEC’s biggest producers but also one of the most sidelined members in recent months—warns that the group is unlikely to reach an agreement on a sizeable cut of around 1.4 million bpd as some are suggesting. Such a failure to act decisively would send oil prices plunging to $40 a barrel, Iran’s OPEC Governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili told Bloomberg in an interview.The cartel and its Russia-led non-OPEC allies may not extend their cooperation pact either, according to Iran’s representative at OPEC—a position typically held by the second most powerful oilman in a cartel member after the oil minister.Iran has repeatedly expressed frustration with the Saudi/Russia-led increase in oil production since June to offset what was expected to be a steep decline in Iranian oil supply with the U.S. sanctions on Tehran’s petroleum and shipping industries.Iran’s oil exports indeed dropped by some 1 million bpd, but they are likely still holding onto above 1 million bpd, while U.S. waivers to eight Iranian customers allow buyers to continue purchasing oil at reduced volumes until the end of April next year.Oil prices have plunged by around 30 percent from early October as the market started to fear an oversupply is building up again, due to record high production in Saudi Arabia and Russia, and an all-time high oil output in the United States, coupled with fears of slowing economic and oil demand growth.“I doubt, with the failure they had in the last three months, that the declaration of cooperation gets extended,” Kazempour told Bloomberg, referring to the Saudi-Russia alliance.  Related: Are Oil Markets About To Turn Around?“Why institutionalize a failure? And it needs unanimity to be extended,” he noted.Iran, for one, will not take part in any cuts while there are U.S. sanctions on its oil, Kazempour said, adding that those who increased production should be the ones to cut, that is the Saudis and Russians and few Arab Gulf states like the UAE and Kuwait.“Now they are asking others to share in the cut. Whoever increased, they should cut,” Kazempour told Reuters on Monday.“The pilot and co-pilot crashed the plane and all 25 passengers are now in critical condition,” said Iran’s OPEC governor.The ‘pilot and co-pilot’, however, agreed this weekend to extend the deal, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said, although he admitted there isn’t an agreement on specific cuts, yet.“But we, together with Saudi Arabia, will do this, and whatever final figure we will decide upon, we agreed that we will monitor the market situation and promptly respond to it,” Putin said.While the general framework between OPEC and non-OPEC may be in place, Saudi Arabia will have to appease growing frustration at smaller members within OPEC and convince them to fall in line, in order to get a unanimous vote on some sort of production cuts, which may not even be worded as ‘reduced output’.  Related: The Saudi Dilemma: To Cut Or Not To CutDays before the December 6-7 meeting in Vienna, Qatar surprisingly announced on Monday that it would be quitting OPEC as of January 1, as it focuses on natural gas.According to Iran’s Kazempour, Qatar is not the only one frustrated with OPEC’s recent decisions, especially the ones taken by the Saudi-Russia co-chaired Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC).“There are many other OPEC members frustrated that the JMMC is deciding on production unilaterally and without the required prior consensus of OPEC,” Kazempour told Reuters.Smaller OPEC members may need some convincing, but a higher price of oil is not an insignificant argument for many of the cartel members who can’t balance their budgets at $60 a barrel Brent.It looks like Saudi Arabia and Russia are ready to continue managing the oil market and will have their way one way or another—if they can’t get consensus on a wording with ‘(…) million barrels per day’ of cuts, they can always bet on a vague statement of ‘market stability’, ‘declaration of cooperation’ to ‘adjust compliance levels’, open to interpretation.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Iran-Oil-To-Fall-To-40-If-OPEC-Fails-To-Reach-Deal.html,"Dec 04, 2018 at 15:39 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Dec 04, 2018",Iran: Oil To Fall To $40 If OPEC Fails To Reach Deal
2018-12-04,"The government of Alberta this week took an unprecedented decision to enforce a crude oil production cut so excess inventories could be shrunk and the price of western Canadian grades could improve, but the industry’s problems are far from over. They will be among the hardest hit by the International Maritime Organization’s new emission rules, to enter into effect in two years, which will require a reduction of the sulfur content of bunkering fuel to 0.5 percent from 3.5 percent.“We’ve got challenges with respect to pipelines, we’ve got challenges with respect to rail and now we’ve got challenges with respect to our demand market,” Bloomberg quoted the chief executive officer of the Canadian Energy Research Institute as saying at a presentation this week. The emission rules will start affecting the price of Canadian crude next year, Allan Fogwill, along with other analysts, believes.Canadian crude is heavy and sour, that is, high in sulfur content, which is the obvious reason why the IMO changes would affect prices, adding to already substantial pressure from pipeline bottlenecks and the rising amount of crude that is being transported by costlier rail.According to IHS Markit analyst Kurt Barrow, the emission rules will make Canadian crude another $7-8 cheaper than West Texas Intermediate in 2019. Even the completion of the Line 3 replacement project won’t offset these losses, although it will add 375,000 bpd to daily pipeline capacity.Another analyst, Wood Mackenzie research director Mark Oberstoetter, told Bloomberg Western Canadian Select will likely be US$20 cheaper than WTI for most of 2019, which is the cost of railway transportation for Albertan heavy crude. All in all, things are looking pretty bad. But how bad is bad?  Related: OPEC Oil Exports Jump Ahead Of MeetingFor one thing, Canadian heavy is the main heavy crude feedstock for U.S. refineries. Canada is in fact the biggest exporter of crude to the United States, at a rate of over 4 million bpd as of September, according to data from the Energy Information Administration, which compares with around 3 million bpd from OPEC. There aren’t a whole lot of alternative sources of heavy crude, what with Venezuela spiraling down into a deeper crisis and production falling along with exports.For another, the new emission rules will not eliminate demand for fuel oil, it will only reduce it. Reuters recently polled 33 refiners on their IMO 2020 plans and found that although as much as 40 percent planned to stop producing high-sulfur fuel oil, the rest had no plans to suspend production despite the expected drop in demand. Instead, they were upgrading their refineries to further process the residual petroleum product into more gasoline and diesel, and also banking on stable demand from the power generation sector: when fuel oil becomes cheap enough, it serves as an alternative to coal.The new emission rules will definitely present a new challenge to Albertan producers on top of what they already have to deal with. However, the importance of their crude for U.S. refineries and the low prices that have opened up the Chinese refining market for more Canadian oil exports should serve as a cushion against major price and production shocks.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-This-The-Next-Disaster-For-Canadian-Drillers.html,"Dec 04, 2018 at 15:15 | Irina Slav","Dec 04, 2018",Is This The Next Disaster For Canadian Drillers?

2018-12-04,"A proposed U.S. legislation that could pave the way for suing OPEC for market manipulation is a “big concern” among the cartel and may weigh on the message from the meeting later this week and on some members’ incentive to continue being part of OPEC, Michael Cohen, the head of energy markets research at Barclays, told CNBC on Tuesday.“I think it’s something that could very easily weigh on the messaging of this meeting that is going to happen on Thursday and Friday,” Cohen told CNBC, when asked to comment on the proposed U.S. legislation in light of the current divisions within OPEC, especially Qatar quitting the cartel.The proposed U.S. legislation—the so-called No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels (NOPEC) Act—could pave the way to antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. against the cartel and its national oil companies, if passed.Forms of antitrust legislation aimed at OPEC were discussed at various times under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, but they both threatened to veto such legislation.In May this year, the NOPEC Act was introduced again. Such legislation would make OPEC subject to antitrust laws by removing a state immunity shield created by judicial precedent.Given U.S. President Donald Trump’s continued criticism of OPEC and the way the cartel manipulates the oil market and prices, OPEC members are concerned that the legislation may pass this time around.“It is certainly possible that a country that is looking to enhance or burnish its ties to the United States may look at the NOPEC legislation and say: ‘Well, we don’t want to be a part of this organization anymore,’” Cohen told CNBC today.OPEC is also said to have urged all its members not to mention specific oil prices, and to instead stick to the ‘market stability’ narrative in public comments about oil policies to avoid the risk of potential U.S. antitrust lawsuits for manipulating the market if the United States passes the legislation.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/NOPEC-Act-Is-A-Big-Concern-For-OPEC-Members.html,"Dec 04, 2018 at 10:37 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Dec 04, 2018",NOPEC Act Is A Big Concern For OPEC Members
2018-12-04,"Crude oil exports from OPEC went up by 619,000 bpd last month, data from French shipping data tracking company Kpler showed, with Venezuela notable for a 358,000-bpd increase alone. In fact, the troubled South American country with the largest oil reserves in the world booked the third-largest increase in monthly exports.Saudi Arabia came on top, with an increase of 791,000 bpd in its exports, followed by the UAE, whose crude oil shipments abroad rose by 470,000 bpd. Angola also exported more in November than October, with the increase at 238,000 bpd, Kpler said.Not surprisingly, Iran booked the largest decline in its crude oil exports as U.S. sanctions entered into effect, despite the waivers granted by Washington; the effect of these will be felt later. For November, however, Iran’s exports were down by 854,000 bpd to a total 1.041 million bpd.Iran’s neighbor, Iraq, also booked a substantial decline in oil exports, down 239,000 bpd from October, to 3.765 million bpd.Saudi Arabia exported an average daily of 8.138 million bpd last month, with Iraq coming second, and the UAE third, with a daily export rate of 2.828 million bpd. Nigeria exported 1.876 million bpd, down by 81,000 bpd from a month earlier.The figures will likely pressure prices, which had just begun to improve slightly after Russian President Putin said at the G20 meeting Moscow was prepared to continue its partnership with OPEC regarding production, which suggested it will join the cuts.While the amount of oil that OPEC and its partners will remove from the market has not yet been settled, analysts saw it at between 1 million bpd and 1.4 million bpd.

2018-12-03,"Oil prices rose on Monday, buoyed by coordinated production cuts – cuts that did not come from Vienna (although that too could occur later this week).Instead, the mandatory reductions were handed down by the provincial government of Alberta. “Perhaps OPEC should therefore consider inviting Canada to its meeting on Friday,” Commerzbank said in a note.Alberta Premier Rachel Notley announced the production cuts “in response to the historically high oil price differential that is costing the national economy more than $80 million per day,” her office said in a statement. Western Canada Select (WCS) has plunged below $15 per barrel, representing a discount to WTI that has hovered at around $40 per barrel.“The price gap is caused by the federal government’s decades-long inability to build pipelines. Ottawa’s failure in this area has left Alberta’s energy producers with few options to move their products, resulting in serious risks for the energy industry and Alberta jobs,” the Alberta Premier’s office said.Alberta’s oil industry is producing roughly 190,000 bpd in excess of available takeaway capacity. The surplus is filling storage up quickly. Oil producers will be required to make cuts on the order of 8.7 percent, or 325,000 bpd, beginning in January. Once the storage glut is reduced, the cuts will narrow to just 95,000 bpd, which will stay in place through the duration of 2019.The first 10,000 bpd for each producer will be excluded from the mandatory cuts, intended to avoid negatively impacting small producers. The baseline used to calculate the cuts will be the highest level of production for each producer over the past six months.Notley expects the production cuts to boost prices for WCS by roughly $4 per barrel, adding $1.1 billion to government revenue between 2019 and 2020.  Related: Why We Should Worry About Low Oil PricesThe provincial government went to lengths to describe the measure as temporary, and one that will be a benefit to government finances. “Every Albertan owns the energy resources in the ground, and we have a duty to defend those resources. But right now, they’re being sold for pennies on the dollar,” Notley said.The production cuts come just days after Notley said that her government was considering paying for increased rail capacity in order to relieve the bottlenecks. That additional rail would add 120,000 bpd in takeaway capacity but wouldn’t be available for another year, and would take time to scale up.Enbridge’s Line 3 replacement project is expected to be completed at the end of 2019, which will offer the first significant increase in takeaway capacity. However, since that is still a rather long time to wait, particularly with WCS having dropped close to $10 per barrel, the provincial government clearly felt it had to act.The extraordinary intervention into the market was supported by some top Canadian oil executives. Some producers had already been slightly curtailing output in recent weeks because of painfully low prices, but there is a first-mover problem that goes into this thinking. Any effort to cut output by one company only stands to benefit another. As such, some oil executives argued that only government action could provide an orderly way to reduce output to narrow price differentials.  Related: New Breakthrough Will Change How Oil Reserves Are Measured“While curtailments have been used before by previous governments, we believe they should only be used for a short period of time, and only in extreme cases,” said a statement by Cenovus CEO Alex Pourbaix. “This is an extreme case. It makes no sense for Alberta to stand by while its valuable oil resources sell for next to nothing, the provincial treasury loses up to 100 million dollars a day, job losses continue to mount and our industry suffers billions of dollars in long-term value destruction.”The largest impact could come in the first quarter of 2019. The reductions will erase some of the inventory overhang, allowing the cuts to be phased out. More rail capacity could ease the midstream burden as well. “We interpret the phrasing of the announced cut as keeping production down 50 kb/d [year-on-year] in 2019 and 200 kb/d below our prior assessment with the greatest impact on 1Q19 (down 225 kb/d quarter-on-quarter) before new rail capacity gradually comes online from April onward,” Goldman Sachs wrote in a note.It’s worth noting that years of pipeline fights from environmental groups, local communities and First Nations are bearing some fruit. The inability to build a major pipeline has put a ceiling on midstream capacity, and the bottleneck has swelled over time, ultimately leading to the latest announcement from Alberta ordering the shutdown of some oil supply. Industry groups and pundits scolded protestors, declaring that the oil would find its way to the market one way or another. However, pipeline delays and logjams are literally keeping oil in the ground.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Alberta-Intervenes-To-Halt-Canadas-Oil-Crisis.html,"Dec 03, 2018 at 15:56 | Nick Cunningham","Dec 03, 2018",Alberta Intervenes To Halt Canada’s Oil Crisis
2018-11-30,"Oil prices have plunged to one-year lows, but refiners in certain parts of the U.S. are not benefitting from cheaper crude.According to new data from the EIA, refining margins for motor gasoline have fallen to five-year lows. “Flattening year-over-year growth in gasoline demand in the United States, combined with high levels of refinery output, have contributed to low or negative motor gasoline refining margins for refiners along the East and Gulf Coasts,” the EIA said on November 27. Gasoline refining margins have been declining since August.In November, U.S. gasoline demand is expected to have averaged 9.2 million barrels per day (mb/d), down 262,000 bpd from a year earlier.(Click to enlarge)Meanwhile, prices for distillates, such as diesel, are much higher. The discrepancy is notable, and the markets for gasoline and distillates have diverged sharply this year. The forthcoming 2020 International Maritime Organization regulations on sulfur content in maritime fuels is set to push extremely dirty heavy fuel oil out of the mix for ship-owners. One of the most important replacements for fuel oil be diesel and gasoil – in other words, distillate demand is set to spike at the start of 2020. In anticipation of these regulations, distillate prices are seeing upward pressure.With diesel prices on the rise and gasoline prices heading in the other direction, refiners might want to maximize diesel output. However, things aren’t that simple. As the EIA notes, for every barrel of crude oil processed in a refinery, it tends to yield twice as much gasoline as it does diesel. “As a result, although gasoline margins have been low recently, refiners cannot completely stop making gasoline in favor of other petroleum products, such as distillate,” the EIA said. (Click to enlarge)But because diesel prices are favorable, refiners are simply churning out product as quickly as possible, which is exacerbating the emerging supply glut of gasoline.This wouldn’t necessarily be a huge problem except that gasoline demand has stalled out in the United States. Part of that is the hangover from higher fuel prices earlier this summer. In essence, refiners are chasing diesel, dumping gasoline onto the market, at a time when consumers have been pulling back. The result has been gasoline supply outpacing demand, which translated into unusually large storage levels.Typically, as peak summer demand season gives way to autumn, refiners go offline for maintenance, which leads to a drawdown in gasoline stocks. But the combination of higher-than-usual refining runs and weak demand meant that gasoline inventories held up through October.Related: Legendary Oil Trader Expects Crude Prices To ReboundTo complicate matters further, much of the surging oil production the Permian basin is light in quality, which means that it tends to be better suited for gasoline production rather than distillates.The recent plunge in crude oil is starting to trickle down into lower pump prices, which could yet provide a bit of a spark to demand. Indeed, in the most recent data release from the EIA, gasoline stocks edged down ever-so-slightly, continuing a downward trend since October. Still, gasoline inventories are at the upper end of the five-year average range at 224.6 million barrels for the week ending on November 23.But the upshot of the differences between gasoline and diesel markets is that refining margins for gasoline have steadily declined over the past few months. The EIA forecasts margins to “remain low during the winter before rebounding and following their normal seasonal patterns heading into the 2019 summer driving season.”It will be interesting see how this affects various refiners and even the integrated oil companies. During the oil market downturn that began in 2014, the oil majors suffered from low crude prices, but did better than pure-play upstream producers because they had their refining units to cushion the blow. Cheap crude stoked demand for motor fuels, and the oil majors benefiting from very large margins on refining.This time around, the narrowing margins for gasoline is ill-timed since it is also occurring alongside a downturn in crude prices. As the EIA notes, this is likely temporary. But it wasn’t so long ago that most analysts and industry executives saw 2018 shaping up to be a hugely positive year. The simultaneous meltdown in refining margins and crude oil prices could dash those hopes.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/What-Crashing-Refining-Margins-Mean-For-Oil-Markets.html,"Nov 30, 2018 at 17:07 | Nick Cunningham","Nov 30, 2018",What Crashing Refining Margins Mean For Oil Markets
2018-11-30,"To cut and push up prices or not to cut and preserve market share, this is the question that Saudi Arabia is facing ahead of this year’s December OPEC meeting. It seems like just yesterday when OPEC met in 2016 and decided to cut production by 1.8 million barrels daily, including from Russia, to reverse the free fall of oil prices. At the time, it worked because everyone was desperate. Now, many OPEC members are both desperate while not yet recovered from the 2014 blow. Saudi Arabia is not an exception.A recent report from Capital Economics said Saudi Arabia has its problems but it could withstand lower oil prices without feeling too much of a pinch. ""Even if [Brent] prices fall further to $40-$50 a barrel, immediate balance of payments strains are unlikely to emerge,"" the report said, with its authors adding the Kingdom would be able to finance its trade deficit from its foreign exchange reserves “for at least a decade.”This suggestion is not universally accepted. Reuters’ John Kemp this week offered a different perspective in his regular column on oil, noting Saudi Arabia’s foreign exchange reserves currently stand at US$500 billion, down from nearly US$750 billion in 2014 when the oil prices slumped under the weight of U.S. shale oil. At the same time, Saudi Arabia is in a major push to diversify its revenue streams and has committed a lot of money to it.Also, Kemp wrote, “The kingdom probably needs to keep several hundred billion dollars’ worth of reserve assets on hand to maintain confidence in its fixed exchange-rate peg to the U.S. dollar and prevent a run on the currency.”It’s a classic rock and a hard place situation for the Saudis. On the one hand, they could continue pumping at the current record rate or close to it, pressuring prices further, which is what they did in 2014. That strategy hurt U.S. shale substantially, but the attempted assault did not go quite as planned. Now, it will once again hurt U.S. shale, but again, it won’t beat the resilience of the US shale patch.  That much should have become clear in the past three years.Related: Saudi Oil Output Hits Record High In NovemberOn the other hand, Saudi Arabia could start cutting, but it will need to convince all other OPEC members to join the cuts and, more importantly, Russia. Reuters earlier today reported, quoting unnamed sources, that Russia had “accepted the need to cut production” and prices immediately jumped, once again highlighting how important the Russia-Saudi Arabia cooperation has become for oil markets, if it even needs highlighting.For now, it seems like a cut is the more likely outcome. In spite of reservations expressed by Nigeria and Libya, if Saudi Arabia managed to convince everyone to cut amid the major tensions with Iran ahead of the U.S. sanctions, then it could probably convince them again, if only on the grounds that if they don’t start cutting all will suffer.Kemp agrees. “Saudi Arabia cannot afford another slump in oil prices,” he warns. “It needs to keep revenues high to help its economy climb out of recession and finance ambitious social and economic transformation programs.”Yet the Kingdom is preparing. Kpler reported this week loadings of Saudi crude since the start of November had reached new highs of 8.14 million bpd, which was 770,000 bpd more than the average daily loadings rate for October and much higher than the last 2018 high of 7.766 million bpd booked for June. The bulk of the increase comes from China, with shipments in that direction up by more than half a million barrels daily in November from October. Production is also at record highs, like Russia’s was ahead of the first cuts in 2016. Perhaps we are seeing a lesson learned there or perhaps the Kingdom is out of options besides cutting.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Saudi-Dilemma-To-Cut-Or-Not-To-Cut.html,"Nov 30, 2018 at 17:04 | Irina Slav","Nov 30, 2018",The Saudi Dilemma: To Cut Or Not To Cut
2018-11-30,"Despite hitting its lowest level in over a year earlier in the week, crude oil is showing signs of stabilizing. This is perhaps an early indication that the worst of the selling may be over. With crude oil, sentiment is being influenced by expectations of production cuts by OPEC and its allies.Crude OilU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures is currently in a position to post a potentially bullish technical closing price reversal bottom on the weekly chart. Helping to form the chart pattern is Thursday’s rapid reversal to the upside on the daily chart. This move was fueled after industry sources said Russia had accepted the need to cut production, together with OPEC ahead of its meeting in Vienna on December 6-7.At the start of the week, crude oil was in a position to post one of its biggest one-month declines in November since the worst of the financial crisis in 2008, having dropped about 22 percent so far. Primarily driving the price action this month has been increasing supply by the United States and Saudi Arabia.Russia Changes its TuneAfter U.S. crude oil fell below $50 for the first time in over a year, the news hit that Russia would consider joining OPEC and other producers to cut output. This triggered the technical reversal in the markets.The reaction by traders to the news about Russia was primarily driven by short-covering, but nonetheless, it is a good sign that the buying may be greater than the selling at…					    ",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Are-Oil-Markets-About-To-Turn-Around.html,"Nov 30, 2018 at 16:56 | Jim Hyerczyk","Nov 30, 2018",Are Oil Markets About To Turn Around?
2018-11-30,"Just as the U.S. shale patch is drafting spending budgets for 2019, oil prices have tumbled 25 percent from four-year highs in early October to just above $50 a barrel WTI Crude at the end of November.Oil at $50 is largely considered the break-even point for many shale developments and is the minimum price at which most U.S. drillers have been budgeting spending plans over the past year or so.Most producers across the shale patch will be announcing 2019 spending plans alongside full-year 2018 earnings releases at end-January and early February, but signs have already started to emerge that the U.S. shale patch will be cutting budgets for 2019.Collective spending plans for next year may be the first budgets cut across the industry since the oil price crash of 2015-2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.Just two months ago, $50 oil was not the base-case scenario at which U.S. companies planned, and few had expected such a steep price correction. Now exploration and production companies—who had just started to report rising cash flows and to finally reward shareholders with buybacks and increased dividends—find themselves in a position to choose from where to cut spending next year, considering that a prolonged period of $50 oil would eat into cash flows and undermine previous cash generation projections.  Anadarko Petroleum is one of the few companies that have already announced its 2019 budget—and it’s lower than this year’s. Anadarko said in mid-November that its 2019 capital investment program is in the US$4.3 billion-US$4.7 billion range, plus a US$1 billion addition to its share buyback program. The company expects around US$1.6 billion adjusted free cash flow at $60 WTI in 2019. So lower WTI prices would undermine this free cash flow estimate.Analysts who until recently expected an uptick in the U.S. shale patch budgets, now see declines. Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, for example, expected minor increases in 2019 budgets, but now sees budgets either flat or down next year compared to this year, Andy McConn, a Houston-based analyst at WoodMac, told Bloomberg. Related: How Much Does OPEC Need To Cut To Balance The Market?The current sentiment and expectations about 2019 budgets are in stark contrast with the mood in the companies’ Q3 earnings releases and budget tweaks.According to a Rystad Energy analysis of 34 onshore producers, their combined capex guidance increased by an additional US$1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2018, after a US$3.7-billion increase in Q2, with companies active in the Permian accounting for over 70 percent of the total budgets adjustment.In the Dallas Fed Energy Survey for Q3—carried out in September when the oil market was still fearing a huge loss of Iranian oil supply—executives at 166 energy firms forecast on average that WTI prices would be  $68.81 per barrel by the end of this year, with responses ranging from $55 to $85 per barrel. Only around 6 percent of respondents expected WTI to be lower than $65 a barrel at end-2018.Two and a half months after the survey, the mood on the market is starkly different and the WTI price is lower than the lowest year-end projections of the company executives. Drillers have started to plan reduction in budgets, according to executives and officials who spoke to Reuters last week.Smaller producers in Texas have already begun to scale back some drilling activity, according to Texas Railroad Commissioner Ryan Sitton.“Six weeks ago some of these were profitable and now they’re break-even,” Sitton told Reuters.Related: The Biggest Losers Of The Current Oil Price Slump“The (price) swing has been large enough that we have some companies that are no longer generating free cash flow.”The next few days may show if WTI prices in the low $50s will persist, as the OPEC/non-OPEC meeting in Vienna will be discussing a production cut to prevent a new global glut and prop up prices.If the cartel and allies fail to lift the market out of the bearish mood or if they decide to avoid angering U.S. President Donald Trump—who wants oil prices even lower— by not acting decisively on cuts, the U.S. shale patch may be in for some complicated math of how to balance production growth and shareholder returns at $50 WTI oil.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Shale-Drillers-May-Cut-Capex-As-Oil-Falls-To-50.html,"Nov 30, 2018 at 16:52 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Nov 30, 2018",Shale Drillers May Cut Capex As Oil Falls To $50
2018-11-30,"As I write, the world’s leaders are meeting at the G20 summit in Argentina. There are, as always, lots of story lines surrounding the meeting, some financial in nature such as the chance of informal trade negotiations, and some not so much, such as whether Donald Trump’s cancellation of his private meeting with Vladimir Putin indicates the end of their bromance. For energy investors though, the meeting will be watched with a different focus. Both Saudi Arabia and Russia are in attendance, so they will be watching for any signs of an agreement to cut oil output.That question is being asked because of current circumstances. Crude oil has been in freefall, with both Brent and WTI having lost around a third since hitting highs in early October. There are some demand related worries involved as trade wars threaten to slow global growth, but the biggest reasons for the drop are supply related. A couple of months ago, those highs were achieved in anticipation of a disruption to global supply as the Trump administration’s abandonment of the Iran nuclear deal with Iran and the resulting sanctions took effect.Since then though, a few things have become clear. Firstly, U.S. production has been stepped up by more than imagined. In addition, the Saudis increased their output to help offset the expected loss from Iran but, most importantly in that context, that loss doesn’t look likely to materialize.

2018-11-30,"A Massachusetts Institute of Technology team of researchers has taken the first three-dimensional images of kerogen’s internal structure, with a level of detail more than 50 times greater than has been previously achieved. The images should allow more accurate predictions of how much oil or gas can be recovered from any given formation.The fossil fuels that provide much of the world’s energy originate in a type of rock known as kerogen, and the potential for recovering these fuels depends crucially on the size and connectedness of the rocks’ internal pore spaces.(Click to enlarge)Using a high-resolution system called electron tomography, researchers probed a tiny sample of kerogen to determine its internal structure. At left, the sample as seen from the outside, and at right, the detailed 3-D image of its internal pore structure. Image Credit: MIT. Click image for the largest view.These new images should allow more accurate predictions of how much oil or gas can be recovered from any given formation. But this wouldn’t change the capability for recovering these fuels, but it could, for example, lead to better estimates of the recoverable reserves of natural gas, which is seen as an important transition fuel as the world tries to curb the use of coal and oil.The findings have been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, in a paper by MIT Senior Research Scientist Roland Pellenq, MIT Professor Franz-Josef Ulm, and others at MIT, CNRS and Aix-Marseille Université (AMU) in France, and Shell Technology Center in Houston.The team, which published results two years ago on an investigation of kerogen pore structure based on computer simulations, used a relatively new method called electron tomography to produce the new 3-D images, which have a resolution of less than 1 nanometer, or billionth of a meter. Previous attempts to study kerogen structure had never imaged the material below 50 nanometers resolution, Pellenq said.Fossil fuels, as their name suggests, form when organic matter such as dead plants gets buried and mixed with fine-grained silt. As these materials get buried deeper, over millions of years the mix gets cooked into a mineral matrix interspersed with a mix of carbon-based molecules. Over time, with more heat and pressure, the nature of that complex structure changes.Related: Goldman: Oil Prices Set For Rebound In 2019The process, a slow pyrolysis, involves “cooking oxygen and hydrogen, and at the end, you get a piece of charcoal,” Pellenq explains. “But in between, you get this whole gradation of molecules,” many of them useful fuels, lubricants, and chemical feedstocks.The new results show for the first time a dramatic difference in the nanostructure of kerogen depending on its age. Relatively immature kerogen (whose actual age depends of the combination of temperatures and pressures it has been subjected to) tends to have much larger pores but almost no connections among those pores, making it much harder to extract the fuel. Mature kerogen, by contrast, tends to have much tinier pores, but these are well-connected in a network that allow the gas or oil to flow easily, making much more of it recoverable, Pellenq explained.The study also reveals that the typical pore sizes in these formations are so small that normal hydrodynamic equations used to calculate the way fluids move through porous materials won’t work. At this scale the material is in such close contact with the pore walls that interactions with the wall dominate its behavior. The research team thus had to develop new ways of calculating the flow behavior.“There’s no fluid dynamics equation that works in these subnanoscale pores,” he said. “No continuum physics works at that scale.”To get these detailed images of the structure, the team used electron tomography, in which a small sample of the material is rotated within the microscope as a beam of electrons probes the structure to provide cross-sections at one angle after another. These are then combined to produce a full 3-D reconstruction of the pore structure. While scientists had been using the technique for a few years, they hadn’t applied it to kerogen structures until now. The imaging was carried out at the CINaM lab of CNRS and AMU, in France (in the group of Daniel Ferry), as part of a long-term collaboration with MultiScale Materials Science for Energy and Environment, the MIT/CNRS/AMU joint lab located at MIT.Related: $50 Oil Puts Shale To The Test“With this new nanoscale tomography, we can see where the hydrocarbon molecules are actually sitting inside the rock,” Pellenq said. Once they obtained the images, the researchers were able to use them together with molecular models of the structure, to improve the fidelity of their simulations and calculations of flow rates and mechanical properties. This could shed light on how production rates decline in oil and gas wells, and perhaps on how to slow that decline.So far, the team has studied samples from three different kerogen locations and found a strong correlation between the maturity of the formation and its pore size distribution and pore void connectivity. The researchers now hope to expand the study to many more sites and to derive a robust formula for predicting pore structure based on a given site’s maturity.This is highly interesting work. Of all the oil and gas discovered so far less than half has been recovered and marketed. Those reservoirs are found, infrastructure installed and connected to markets. Secondary and tertiary recovery are already very big businesses indeed.So one has to wonder if the big private petroleum firms may or may not be at this point or beyond. These firms hire the best petroleum engineers in the world and petroleum engineers are all very bright folks indeed.But the research is offering, out in the open, real basic information and importantly, perspective.By New Energy and FuelMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/New-Breakthrough-Will-Change-How-Oil-Reserves-Are-Measured.html,"Nov 30, 2018 at 16:04 | Brian Westenhaus","Nov 30, 2018",New Breakthrough Will Change How Oil Reserves Are Measured
2018-11-30,"Oil prices dropped early on Friday, on course to finish their worst month since 2008, as fears of oversupply and slowing demand growth dragged oil down into a bear market in November with prices off by some 30 percent from four-year highs in early October.At 07:10 a.m. EDT on Friday, WTI Crude was down 1.81 percent at $50.52, and Brent Crude traded down 1.47 percent at $59.03.On Thursday, oil prices jumped on reports that Russia had conceded that it needs to reduce oil production and join a new Saudi-led OPEC cut to balance the market.The rise didn’t last long—prices headed down again on Friday, pressured by rising U.S. oil production and comments by Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak, who said in an interview with the TASS news agency that “To me, the current price range is comfortable for producers and consumers.”Earlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin also signaled that Moscow is okay with oil prices at their current levels.Russia is comfortable with oil at around $60, Putin said, a week ahead of the OPEC+ meeting in Vienna and just two days before the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires.In his interview with TASS published on Friday, Novak, as usual, was elusive about Russia’s position about a new production cut, and said that Moscow will have its stance ready by the December 6-7 meeting.Before the OPEC/non-OPEC meeting, the oil market will be looking for clues about global economy and trade at this weekend’s G-20 summit. U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to meet on the sidelines of the event to discuss the trade war.

2018-11-29,"Brent crude has sunk to US$60 a barrel with WTI down to US$52 and, not surprisingly, talk about Brent hitting US$100 a barrel by the end of the year is suddenly scarce. Importers are breathing a sigh of relief, no doubt, and exporters are probably beginning to worry slightly.Overall, the news about lower oil prices is good. It’s good for the emerging markets, as a Bloomberg review of the lower-price situation showed and as common sense would suggest. Every US$10 drop in the price of oil translates into a 0.5-0.7-percent of GDP increase in income in the biggest oil importers, an estimate by Capital Economics cited by Bloomberg revealed.Now, economic growth in these same emerging markets slowed down this year, prompting a number of forecasters to revise down their oil demand projections. Lower oil prices would probably spur more demand, especially if the U.S. dollar weakens, as right now the strong greenback is serving as a deterrent to oil demand growth.More demand is good for producers as a general rule, but it has to come at the right price and as usual, producers of crude and importers of the commodity have different views of what the right price is. Indeed, that US$10 decline in the price of oil, according to Capital Economics, would translate into 3-5 percent lower GDP in most Gulf states and 1.5-2 percent lower GDP in the UAE, Russia, and Nigeria.While this is not the best of news, it seems the Gulf economies are quite resilient to oil price shocks. Capital Economics estimated that even if prices went lower, to US$40 a barrel and even US$30, some Gulf economies, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, and Qatar would be able to plug their budget deficits from the forex reserves “for at least a decade”. One interesting point Capital Economics makes is that the UAE could fund its budget deficit “indefinitely,” which certainly sounds pretty bold.  Related: Natural Gas Prices Fall Below Zero In TexasThe IMF, however, recently warned that Gulf economies remain vulnerable to oil price shocks. The fund acknowledged that in several countries, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, higher oil revenues earlier this year had more than offset increases in public spending, “there is a tangible risk that the commitment to implement key fiscal measures and structural reforms will weaken amid higher oil prices.”Now that prices have slumped again, these economies will get the necessary motivation to continue their diversification efforts, so they would be ultimately positive for them, as well. And yet, many seem to expect this price slump to be short-lived and prices to return to levels above US$50-60 a barrel.Oil Price Information Service co-founder Tom Kloza, for one, told CNBC last week he expected prices to rebound before long as both Brent and WTI were currently being oversold. “Oil can be stabilized in December and will be helped by the higher demand as U.S. refiners ramp up to over 18-million barrels a day of crude use. A cold northern hemisphere winter juices up demand as well,” the analyst explained.  Related: BP Is Comfortable With $50 OilWhat’s more, most analysts seem to expect OPEC to agree on a production cut of at least 1 million bpd and also most expect Russia to agree to join the cut despite its usual guardedness in making any definite announcements before the deadline, which this time is December 6 when the cartel will meet in Vienna.This will push prices higher, probably prompting another critical tweet from President Trump, and once again put emerging economies under the twin pressure of expensive oil and costly dollars. But some, such as Morgan Stanley, don’t see the cut as a certainty. The investment bank estimates the likelihood of a cut agreement at 66 percent.This means there is a good chance OPEC—and Russia, which hasn’t been enthusiastic about the idea of new cuts so far—pumping at current levels. And then that scenario of Capital Economics with oil at US$40 and even US$30 might materialize.

2018-11-29,"A week before OPEC and allies meet in Vienna to discuss a new oil production cut, the market is still wondering whether the leaders of the OPEC and non-OPEC nations—Saudi Arabia and Russia—will cement their cooperation in managing the oil market by agreeing on a fresh cut to prevent a glut and prop up prices.It’s not unusual for Russia to leave everyone guessing until the very last moment whether it is on board with a production cut—Moscow has done so in all previous meetings since its oil-market-management cooperation with Riyadh started two years ago in November 2016.What’s unusual this time around is that next week’s OPEC+ meeting will be much more politically charged than previous gatherings.U.S. President Donald Trump Twitter-crashed the party weeks before it begins with comments that he hopes there won’t be a cut, with a thank-you-Saudi Arabia tweet, and an urge for even lower oil prices, while basically declining to blame Saudi Arabia and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.Even without President Trump’s recent comments on oil prices and the Khashoggi affair, Saudi Arabia and Russia have been reading from the same book, but they are not exactly on the same page about where they want oil prices to be.Saudi Arabia is not happy at all with Brent Crude at $60—it needs much higher prices, probably closer to $80, to balance its budget. Russia, on the other hand, doesn’t need as high oil prices as the Saudis do, and due to its complex oil taxation system, Russian companies benefit more from lower oil prices and higher production. Moscow also moved in early November to cap wholesale fuel prices to prevent further gasoline price spikes—a highly politically sensitive issue for President Vladimir Putin, who has also enacted an unpopular pension reform to lift retirement age.  Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said at the end of an OPEC panel meeting in early November that the group needed “to do whatever it takes to balance the market,” and that OPEC analysis shows that a cut of 1 million bpd may be needed to restore market balance amid fears that oversupply has started to build again.  Related: Natural Gas Prices Fall Below Zero In TexasAt the same time, Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak warned against hasty decisions on another U-turn in oil production policies, and said that he would be discussing potential oil production cuts with Russian producers, who don’t appear too keen to start cutting again after the OPEC/non-OPEC meeting in June gave them leeway to ramp up output to post-Soviet record highs.  Officially Russia says that it will continue cooperation with Saudi Arabia in the oil market, but its still dodging any specifics about a possible production cut.“As for the need to limit production or not, I will not say anything about this for the time being. We must be very careful in this respect because every word is important and affects the federal budget revenues. However, it is obvious that we should cooperate and we will cooperate,” Putin said in mid-November.Analysts believe that despite dubious economic benefits from high oil prices for Moscow, Putin will find the political gain irresistible—further boosting Russia’s influence in the Middle East—and will have Russia agree to cuts proposed by Saudi Arabia.Putin, Trump, and Mohammed bin Salman are all scheduled to attend the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires this week. Putin and Trump are expected to meet there, and so are Putin and MBS. The summit in Argentina may turn out to be the first leg of next week’s OPEC+ meeting in Vienna, at which the Saudi and Russian energy ministers, al-Falih and Novak, may only seal what their respective bosses will have agreed upon in Buenos Aires.  Related: The Biggest Losers Of The Current Oil Price SlumpRiyadh, however, is caught between a rock and a hard place. It definitely needs and wants oil prices higher than $60, but Trump’s support for Mohammed bin Salman could lead the Saudis to refrain from angering the U.S. President. Saudi Arabia may refrain from announcing a decisive sizeable cut next week, opting instead for a ‘quiet cut’ not worded as a production cut at all.Such OPEC/non-OPEC announcements are not unusual at all—vague statements stressing on ‘market stability’ are OPEC’s specialty. The June meeting for example ended with the vaguest of announcements for striving for 100-percent compliance instead of 140 percent and more in previous months, and the Saudis and Russians interpreted it as raising production by 1 million bpd. The outcome of next week’s meeting may not be much different—a commitment to market stability and some percentage of compliance open to interpretation by the key oil price makers Saudi Arabia and Russia.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-The-Saudi-Russia-Oil-Bromance-At-Risk.html,"Nov 29, 2018 at 09:15 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Nov 29, 2018",Is The Saudi-Russia Oil Bromance At Risk?
2018-11-28,"Crude oil prices slipped further down today after the Energy Information Administration reported crude oil inventories for the week to November 23 had added 3.6 million barrels. That’s compared with a build of 4.9 million barrels a week earlier.The EIA figures came after yesterday the American Petroleum Institute reported an estimated inventory increase of 3.453 million barrels, which failed to affect prices in any significant way.EIA also said gasoline inventories last week had declined by 800,000 barrels and distillate fuel inventories had added 2.6 million barrels. A week earlier, the authority estimated a decline of 1.3 million barrels in gasoline and a 100,000-barrel decline in distillate fuel inventories.Meanwhile, production is hitting new highs and this will continue, according to most estimates, unless oil prices continue declining at a fast pace. The likelihood of this happening is relatively low, however. OPEC is meeting next week in Vienna to discuss a new round of production cuts and most analysts expect the cuts to be agreed with Russia also joining in again.However, Morgan Stanley, for one, sees a 33-percent chance of the cartel failing or refusing to agree a production cut, in which case prices will definitely slump more, pressured by bleak economic outlooks and concerns about a crude oil oversupply. The argument against a production cut is simple enough: market share. It’s no wonder some OPEC members have already spoken against a cut, notably Libya, which said it expected to be granted an exemption from any cuts.Besides the OPEC meeting, oil market observers would be watching the G20 meeting, where Russia may or may not give a clear indication whether it will join any cut agreements. Just like last time, Moscow would be a crucial ally for the cartel if it decides to join the cuts or a deal-breaker if it decides to sit these out.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Falls-On-Crude-Inventory-Build.html,"Nov 28, 2018 at 09:45 | Irina Slav","Nov 28, 2018",Oil Falls On Crude Inventory Build
2018-11-27,"Donald Trump continues to take credit for lowering oil prices.So great that oil prices are falling (thank you President T). Add that, which is like a big Tax Cut, to our other good Economic news. Inflation down (are you listening Fed)!Trump’s tweetstorm complicates the OPEC+ meeting in Vienna next week. Trump is very much leaning on Saudi Arabia, pressuring them not to cut output. And he has gone out of his way to protect the Saudis even though the CIA has concluded that crown prince Mohammed bin Salman likely ordered the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. He clearly expects the Saudis to return the favor by not cutting production.This puts Riyadh in a bind. Saudi Arabia needs to patch up its relationship with the West, but it also can ill-afford oil prices at current levels. Saudi Arabia needs Brent to trade north of $80 per barrel for its budget to breakeven. Massive budget deficits during the 2014-2016 downturn help explain Riyadh’s about-face in late 2016 – they had tried to force high-cost drillers out of the market by crashing oil prices, but ultimately caved and engineered an OPEC+ production cut to push prices back up.  Related: How President Trump Is Undermining U.S. Oil ProducersLittle has changed since then. Saudi Arabia’s spending commitments are still large, and that is before we even take into account MbS’ overly-hyped economic reform proposals. Saudi Aramco is also trying to figure out how to transform itself for the long haul. There was the much-ballyhooed Aramco IPO that has since been shelved. There were the plans for Aramco to issue one of the largest corporate bond offerings ever in order to finance a major stake in Sabic, the state-owned Saudi chemical firm. That initiative was also recently abandoned. Now, Aramco’s CEO says the company will spend $500 billion to transform itself into a global refiner and chemical maker.That is going to require a lot of money, which means that the Saudi government desperately needs a rebound in oil prices. But that goal could run afoul of the American president, who just bailed them out over the Khashoggi murder.The murder of Jamal Khashoggi put a lot more in jeopardy than merely low oil prices. MbS, after several years of glowing press in the West, put his country’s strategic alliance with the U.S. at risk when he (according to the CIA) ordered the assassination of Khashoggi. Now, with only Trump vouching for MbS, amidst a push by the U.S. foreign policy establishment to throw the crown prince under the bus, the Saudis have little room to anger the White House. That potentially means giving up on the more aggressive oil option floated a few weeks ago – a cut in OPEC+ production on the order of 1.4 mb/d.  Related: The Biggest Losers Of The Current Oil Price SlumpThe Wall Street Journal reports that the latest plan hatched in Riyadh is a so-called “quiet cut” in Vienna, which consists of a re-dedication to the original OPEC+ production cuts, emphasizing a return to 100 percent compliance. Because Saudi Arabia is now massively overproducing, by about 1 million barrels per day (mb/d), a return to the prior production target would translate into a sizable 1 mb/d cut.“It will be still a big cut but less pronounced,” a senior Saudi oil adviser told the WSJ. The report suggested that this plan was “gaining traction among OPEC officials this week.”The “quiet cut” would be an attempt to thread the needle. It would be small enough that it might keep Trump happy. It would also be small enough that Russia could sign on. Moscow has been more reluctant than the Saudis to slash output. But it would be large enough for Saudi Arabia – and large enough, in theory, to arrest the meltdown in prices.“It is quite a political move. The last thing Saudi Arabia wants to do at the moment is to risk upsetting Trump,” the senior Saudi oil adviser told the WSJ.The sudden sensitivity about how its actions are perceived by Washington demonstrates the far-reaching fallout of the Jamal Khashoggi murder. MbS has sacrificed a ton of leverage at the OPEC+ meeting, and more importantly, he has essentially given up full control over Saudi oil policy, for little gain.“Because of Khashoggi, the Saudis will do anything to make sure Trump doesn’t do anything nasty” to them, an OPEC official told the WSJ.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/How-Much-Oil-Production-Will-The-Saudis-Cut.html,"Nov 27, 2018 at 17:15 | Nick Cunningham","Nov 27, 2018",How Much Oil Production Will The Saudis Cut?
2018-11-27,"Three countries currently account for close to 40 percent of global crude oil production and only one of these countries is a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The three are Russia, the United States, and Saudi Arabia and as their clout over oil markets increases with rising production rates, OPEC’s is set to decline, at least temporarily.Reuters’ John Kemp noted in a recent column on the topic that the so-called troika now called the shots more than ever before: all three countries produced north of 11 million bpd a day in October, a record high and more than the combined production of the rest of OPEC. And, according to OPEC, this state of affairs will continue to develop in a direction unfavorable for OPEC with the troika’s combined production rising to over 40 percent of the global total this year while OPEC’s share falls below 30 percent.Each of the three producers has its own oil production policy that is relatively independent of other producers’. True, Saudi Arabia and Russia have been playing on the same team for the last two years to a large extent because the game strategy has been mutually beneficial. Yet we have seen abundant indications that the moment the interests of the two begin to diverge each is likely to drop the team game and pursue its own priorities. The U.S. in the meantime has become the single largest swing factor outside the OPEC+ club with relentlessly rising production that could push it to the top spot globally next year.This production will only continue to rise if OPEC now decides to start cutting production once again in order to push prices higher, further strengthening the U.S.’ importance on the global oil market. So, does this all mean OPEC is as good as dead? For the time being, mostly yes. Most of its members, as Kemp notes, fall in one or more of the following categories: “is struggling under sanctions, mismanagement and unrest; is too small to matter; is maximizing production rather than participating in output controls; or simply aligns its output policies with those of Saudi Arabia.”  Related: $50 Oil Puts Shale To The TestThe future remains uncertain, however. Most respectable forecasters such as the Energy Information Administration and the International Energy Agency are upbeat about the growth of oil demand, but the upbeat forecasts come with conditions: the IEA most recently said in its World Energy Outlook that producers will need to up investments in new conventional production substantially to be ale to respond to this demand. Failing that, the U.S. would have to increase its shale oil production by as much as 10 million bpd in the seven years to 2025, which is a bold target, to say the least.OPEC members are obvious candidates for some of this production growth. Despite a lot of worry around the cartel’s spare capacity earlier this year when it became clear the cuts need to be reversed to rein in prices, some of the members, such as Iraq and Libya, are on track to grow their production. True, this growth will likely be nowhere near the more than a million bpd that U.S. producers have added in the past year, but it could be substantial in the case of Iraq, if the political and price conditions allow it.What’s more, Venezuela and Iran are unlikely to spend the rest of eternity under sanctions. There is a possibility, however, remote at the moment, that these two could at some point reverse the decline in production they are experiencing now. Iran has already demonstrated it could ramp up pretty quickly if given the chance. In other words, OPEC’s clout on oil markets may be waning but it might be too early to bury the cartel for good just yet.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Oil-Powerhouses-Replacing-OPEC.html,"Nov 27, 2018 at 17:10 | Irina Slav","Nov 27, 2018",The Oil Powerhouses Replacing OPEC
2018-11-27,"The civil war in Syria has resulted in government-controlled areas being deprived of domestic oil. Before the war, Eastern Syria produced 95 percent of the country’s oil. Today, Syrian government forces have been forced to source oil from external actors to power the country. Last week, the Trump administration exposed a complicated scheme involving companies and individuals in Russia, Iran, and Syria working together to transport oil to the necessary areas. Sanctions have now been announced concerning those accused of participating in this complicated Iranian-Russian plan to smuggle oil.The schemeThis oil smuggling scheme has, allegedly, been in place since 2014, transporting millions of barrels of oil to war-torn Syria. Damascus, in turn, has facilitated the transfer of hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp’s Quds Force to Hamas and Hezbollah. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declared “Today we are acting against a complex scheme Iran and Russia have used to bolster the Assad regime and generate funds for Iranian malign activities”.The critical actor within this plan has been Mohammad Amer Alchwiki and his Russia-based company, Global Vision Group. The Syrian national Alchwiki was central to both the delivery of oil to Syria and the transfer of funds via Iran’s Quds force to Hamas and Hezbollah. The source of the alleged ‘malign’ activities is the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) which provided the money.In order to conceal the source, the CBI apparently used Iran-based Tadbir Kish Medical and Pharmaceutical Company to transfer money to Alchwiki’s Global Vision Company. The companies both have a bank account at the Mir Business Bank in Russia which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Iran’s Bank Melli. The front company is a ‘medical’ organization, meaning it adheres to humanitarian needs so that sanctions do not apply.In Russia, Global Vision has an agreement with Promsyrioimport, a subsidiary of the Russian Ministry of Energy (Minergo). The Russian company facilitates the purchase and shipment of Iranian oil purchased from the National Iranian Oil Company to Syria. Transport is extra precarious as some of the ships have been insured by European companies and allegedly have turned off their beacons since 2014 to conceal their destination.  Related: Mexico’s Oil Crisis Deepens(Click to enlarge)In addition, Alchwiki has also acted as a conduit for Tehran to transfer money to proxies in the region. Using his international connections at the CBI and Mir Business Bank, he has been an interlocutor on behalf of the Syrian government. As with the oil scheme, the CBI played a central role by providing the necessary funds.Confronting IranIt has been the Trump administration’s policy to confront Iran, and these sanctions are further evidence of that. The U.S. withdrawal from the Iran Nuclear Deal was the prelude of opposing Tehran in political, economic, and diplomatic areas. Washington’s success has been mixed.Politically and diplomatically, President Trump’s actions unified an unusual alliance of global powers including Russia, China, France, Germany, and the U.K. in maintaining the Nuclear Deal. The U.S. has also tried uniting several Arab states in what has been called ‘the Arab NATO’. This initiative isn’t yet the success it was hoped to become, primarily due to the blockade of Qatar by several other members. The awkward collaboration of these Arab countries seems to be motivated by appeasing Trump rather than confronting Iran.  Related: The Real Effect Of Iran Sanction WaiversOn an economic level, Washington has had more success in confronting Iran. After the signing of the Nuclear Deal, many companies showed a willingness to invest in the country. The reimposition of sanctions, however, made many companies reconsider their investment plans. Most notable of those companies was French energy giant Total which abandoned its massive South Pars LNG project.Although the U.S. has granted temporary sanction waivers to eight countries to import Iranian oil, it is highly unlikely these will be extended. The prime reason for Washington’s decision was its fear of increasing the price for oil by depriving the market of 1.5 million barrels of Iranian oil. Currently, Tehran is under pressure as the economy is failing and protestors are taking to the streets.Despite the difficulties Iran is facing, many analysts believe Tehran will be able to ride out the storm. Despite the recent drop in prices, the country is aided by relatively high oil revenues and the inability of Trump to form a united coalition as the Obama Administration managed with the previous nuclear agreement.These new sanctions will not have the desired effect of crippling the Syrian economy or depriving Assad support of Moscow and Tehran. It is likely that oil shipments will continue while the U.S. itself faces increasing pressure from a confrontational Turkey in Eastern Syria vis-à-vis the Kurdish YPG.By Vanand Meliksetian for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Stopping-Syrias-Oil-Smuggling-Scheme.html,"Nov 27, 2018 at 16:43 | Vanand Meliksetian","Nov 27, 2018",Stopping Syria’s Oil Smuggling Scheme
2018-11-27,"The ongoing slump in oil prices, which has seen crude fall so sharply from the 52-week high set in October that $1 trillion has been wiped off energy stocks, will cut deep into the pockets of major producers like Saudi Arabia, Russia, Nigeria and Angola. As the world heads into an “unprecedented time of uncertainty” in oil markets, however, it’s not only OPEC members who will suffer. Even countries who are less naturally exposed to fluctuations in oil rents, such as Malaysia and Canada, are more vulnerable than usual to the current oil price crash thanks to poor policymaking.Record lossesAs recently as early October, Brent crude was trading at almost $87 per barrel, amid predictions of $100 a barrel. Since then, the commodity has endured an unprecedented run of losses. Affected simultaneously by a glut in supply and a drop-off in demand, oil is now valued at almost half of what it was two months ago, after recording its biggest single-day drop in three years.The projected decrease in supplies precipitated by American sanctions on Iranian oil has failed to materialize, thanks to the Trump administration unexpectedly issuing waivers for eight countries, including major importers China and India. More worryingly, this abundance in supply may only account for roughly 15 percent of the current slump in prices, with the rest caused by depressed demand linked to sluggish economies.OPEC under pressureAs the industry holds its breath hoping that the December 6th meeting will stabilize crude prices, lethargic demand is far more concerning than outsized supply, as OPEC countries do not have direct control over it. Indeed, it’s estimated that OPEC was responsible for only 15 percent of the global increase in oil production between October 2017 and October 2018, while several of its biggest members are struggling to break even: de facto cartel leader Saudi Arabia needs oil prices to average out at $70 just to balance the books. Smaller OPEC countries are even more exposed: Nigeria and Angola, for example, rely on crude for more than 80 percent of their exports.Other emerging markets endangeredIt’s unsurprising that those emerging markets whose GDP depends on oil will suffer bitterly as crude prices plummet. Less widely analyzed, but just as troubling, are countries which have left themselves vulnerable to an oil slump through their own policy choices rather than an abundance of petroleum resources.  Related: Legendary Oil Trader Expects Crude Prices To ReboundFor example, after years of weaning itself off of petroleum dependence, Malaysia is newly threatened by the oil price crash, thanks to risky policy decisions from its Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad. Since the 93-year-old ex-strongman regained the premiership in May, Kuala Lumpur has bled $3 billion in foreign investment over apprehension that he will continue the same controversial economic policies which characterized his first stint as PM from 1981 to 2003.Mahathir has not assuaged those concerns by scrapping the goods-and-services tax (GST) which constituted roughly 20% of governmental revenue. Malaysian finance officials have raised alarm about the GST’s abolition, emphasizing that the previous government had instituted the tax to reduce the country’s dependence on petroleum and to shore up the Malaysian economy in case of another oil price crash.Mahathir’s expansionary 2019 budget had counted on oil rents to patch the hole left by the abolition of the GST. Unfortunately, this plan required state oil and gas giant Petronas to fork over an extraordinary special dividend—a proposition which prompted Moody’s to downgrade Petronas’ outlook to negative—and assumed a Brent crude price of $72 a barrel—a figure that, less than a month after the budget was released, seems dangerously optimistic.Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has lampooned the budget, noting that his administration had planned its finances around a crude oil price $18 below the global rate out of prudence: “if the conditions improve, we will get a bonus. If it gets worse, we would have already made preparations”. With Brent breaching $60 and Petronas dragging down the Malaysian stock exchange, Mahathir’s administration may regret not having made such preparations.Canada’s calamitous infrastructural problemsMalaysia’s beleaguered premier is not the only leader whose poorly-crafted policies have left his country unnecessarily exposed to the whims of the oil market. Bottlenecks have been building in Alberta for years as more crude is extracted from the Athabasca oil sands than existing pipelines can carry, an issue Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government has failed to address.Trudeau made a risky bid to cancel the Northern Gateway pipeline in favor of the Trans Mountain project, which would have tripled the amount of petroleum products being shipped out of Alberta. The PM’s gamble backfired in August, when Canada’s Federal Court of Appeal blocked construction on Trans Mountain. With the Keystone XL and Energy East projects also sidelined—the latter likely for political reasons rather than concerns about profitability—Trudeau has been left facing mounting criticism and an ever-deepening oil crisis in Canada’s richest province.  Related: A Unique Play In SolarOttawa’s seeming inability to see a pipeline project to completion means that Canada has an overabundance of crude oil with nowhere to ship it to, forcing Canadian producers to sell oil at a steep discount. This is a particularly serious problem when global prices are already sinking—Canadian oil recently fell to just $13.46 per barrel, the cheapest worldwide.The differential between Canadian and global oil prices means that Alberta is losing a staggering $100 million per day, a loss which is not only hamstringing future investment in the industry, but imperiling the entire nation’s economy. Under Canada’s system of revenue sharing, Ottawa counts on some $22 billion from oil-rich Alberta to distribute to less affluent provinces.Stormy waters aheadCanadian coffers are bleeding at an alarming rate as global oil prices drop, with no end in sight to the predicament. With U.S. shale output expected to reach record levels next month and continue growth into the 2020s—though America is hampered by its own pipeline capacity problems— the ongoing supply glut could suppress oil prices for the foreseeable future.The remarkable recovery in oil prices since the last crash in 2016 allowed oil producers, both inside and outside OPEC, to breathe a sigh of relief. Regrettably, it also gave countries like Malaysia and Canada breathing room to pursue policies which have left them needlessly vulnerable to crude’s next downward swing.By Richard Talley for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Biggest-Losers-Of-The-Current-Oil-Price-Slump.html,"Nov 27, 2018 at 15:26 | Richard Talley","Nov 27, 2018",The Biggest Losers Of The Current Oil Price Slump
2018-11-27,"Prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) remain weak going into what forecasters are claiming will be a warmer than usual winter season in the Northern Hemisphere. In fact, last week spot prices for the super-cooled fuel in Asian tumbled some 10 percent, hitting three month lows, an uncharacteristic development for this time of year. Reuters, citing traders, said that LNG spot prices for January delivery in North Asia LNG-AS were estimated at $10 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), 90 cents lower than last week.Factors continuing to put downward pressure on prices include warmer temperatures, LNG storage levels in the world’s top three LNG importers (Japan, China and South Korea) remaining high and plunging Brent oil prices which long term LNG contracts are mostly linked to. Though spot purchases are not usually linked to oil prices, they often follow either oil prices upward or downward trajectory. A Singapore-based trader said that “the big question mark right now is how the weather will pan out as the market will quickly turn once it starts to get cold. But until then, it’s tank-top (inventory levels) right now in many places.”LNG doldrumsJapan's weather bureau earlier this month said the El Niño weather pattern appears to have formed and that there was a 70 percent chance it would continue into the Northern Hemisphere for spring. Meanwhile, a U.S. government forecast predicted a 80 percent chance of El Nino lasting in the Northern Hemisphere unto spring. El Niño is a climate cycle in the Pacific Ocean that occurs every five years or more which has a global impact on weather patterns. The cycle begins when warm water in the western tropical Pacific Ocean shifts eastward along the equator toward the coast of South America.Global oil prices are also putting downward pressure on LNG prices as oil prices have pivoted in just a little more than a month after hitting the mid $80s per barrel price point for global benchmark Brent crude and the mid $70s price point for U.S. benchmark, NYMEX-traded West Texas Intermediate Crude (WTI) crude futures.Prices are now 30 percent off recent highs amid concerns of a growing supply glut widening from record oil output in the U.S., Russia and Saudi Arabia and after Washington issued sanctions waivers to several countries for their Iranian oil imports.  Related: Goldman: Oil Prices Set For Rebound In 2019This extra supply comes as demand growth is projected to dampen amid economic downturn from the ongoing trade war between Washington and Beijing and continued sluggish economic growth in emerging economies. A robust U.S. dollar is also eating into demand for oil since oil is traded in dollars and a strong greenback adds to the cost of oil imports, hitting particularly hard countries like India, the Philippines, Indonesia and others. However, weaker oil prices over the last month has offered some respite for oil import dependent countries.The third reason that LNG spot prices in Asia are tumbling is that storage levels, as already mentioned, are full - particularly in China as energy planners in Beijing try to avert a repeat of last year’s fiasco when the government sought to replace coal with cleaner burning natural gas during the winter too quickly, resulting in a shortage of natural gas and the diversion of the cleaner burning fuel from industrial end users to residential users.As far back as August, China began filling underground gas storage tanks, including state energy giant PetroChina, operator of the Xiangguosi storage facility, injecting gas from Myanmar to fill the vast chambers 3,000 meters (9,900 ft) under the mountaintop. Reports said at the time that China was aiming to turn hundreds of tapped and some still producing wells into storage facilities after a severe winter supply crunch left it short of the clean-burning fuel.By Tim Daiss for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Three-Reasons-Why-LNG-Prices-In-Asia-Are-Plunging.html,"Nov 27, 2018 at 11:32 | Tim Daiss","Nov 27, 2018",Three Reasons Why LNG Prices In Asia Are Plunging
2018-11-27,"OPEC will probably agree to cut production to the tune of between 1 and 1.5 million bpd, analyst Johannes Benigni from Austrian JBC Energy Group told CNBC, adding there was clearly a glut on global oil markets at the moment and such a cut would likely help the market to return to balance.“OPEC will probably manage to stabilize the oil market by choosing the right language,” Benigni said. “They will indicate a cut of between 1 million and 1.5 million, and that will do, the market probably will stabilize.”It’s somewhat surprising how fast the market swung into excess after in June, OPEC and Russia agreed to stop cutting production and to begin to ramp up as prices climbed to uncomfortably high levels for some major importers. This month all three biggest producers globally hit new records, with Saudi Arabia’s daily production rate exceeding 11 million bpd for the first time ever.  Related: $50 Oil Puts Shale To The TestThe latest production data from the Kingdom, Russia, and the United States has pressured prices in addition to gloomy demand outlooks, and the talk about production cuts started by Saudi Arabia has not been able to apply sufficient counter pressure.Yet if these talks end with a decision to start cutting, price movement could be reversed. What’s more, the glut is not across all grades, according to JBC Energy Group’s chairman said.“What really are in oversupply are the light crude barrels which are coming out of the U.S.,” he said. “So the expectation or the hope for OPEC right now would be that prices go lower, and demand may come back.”But others are skeptical that this will be so easy to do. In a note to clients, Jefferies said today “The oil price correction has become a rout of historic proportions,” as quoted by Reuters. “The negative price reaction is as severe as the 2008 financial crisis and the aftermath of the November 2015 OPEC meeting, when the group decided not to act in the face of a very over-supplied market,” the investment bank said.

2018-11-26,"President Trump recently took credit for the plunge in oil prices since early October. As I noted in a recent article, it’s true that the President’s actions have contributed to the drop in oil prices, but at a cost that has been largely ignored.This week the President decided to share the credit for lower oil prices on Twitter:(Click to enlarge)President Trump thanks Saudi Arabia for low oil prices.How President Trump Affected Oil PricesLet’s review.The trade war with China resulted in China halting imports of U.S. oil. Prior to that, U.S. oil producers had been shipping half a million barrels a day to China. This loss of market hurt U.S. oil producers, and helped push inventories higher in the U.S. This further hurt U.S. oil producers by pushing prices down.Second, leading up to the implementation of sanctions on Iran that would cut off their oil exports, President Trump persuaded Saudi Arabia to begin pumping more oil to compensate for Iran’s pending lost exports.Then, just before sanctions were set to go into effect, President Trump announced that waivers would be given to a number of countries to allow them to continue to import Iranian oil. Among those countries was China, which means U.S. oil producers lost business to Iran as a result of this decision.The FalloutSaudi Arabia was caught off guard by the decision to grant waivers, which resulted in too much oil in the market. The price of oil predictably plunged, but Saudi Arabia has vowed to cut production. They are also working with other countries to engineer an even bigger production cut.The President is now attempting to pacify Saudi Arabia by giving the country a pass on the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October, and by publicly thanking them on Twitter. But that will be unlikely to compensate for billions in lost revenue over what Saudi Arabia undoubtedly considers to be a double cross.

But this summer U.S. net imports fell to just under two million barrels a day, and they are on a trajectory to reach zero in a few years. That is, unless we enact policies that hurt the U.S. oil industry.Consider the logic of the tariffs President Trump has pushed. Yes, they will drive up prices for U.S. consumers, but the argument is that it will ultimately benefit the U.S. by bringing manufacturing back to the country. How is this different from high oil prices? They incentivize U.S. oil producers, which lowers our dependence on foreign oil. The impact on consumers seems to be a political consideration when it comes to gasoline prices, but not on all of the products that are being affected by tariffs.President Trump has an outdated view on oil prices, and one that is inconsistent with his logic on tariffs. If he wants to ensure a robust U.S. oil industry that could increasingly marginalize Saudi Arabia’s influence, he needs to stop undermining the U.S. oil industry.By Robert RapierMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/How-President-Trump-Is-Undermining-US-Oil-Producers.html,"Nov 26, 2018 at 15:53 | Robert Rapier","Nov 26, 2018",How President Trump Is Undermining U.S. Oil Producers
2018-11-26,"On the day U.S. sanctions against Iran went into effect, Brent crude traded at US$72.68 a barrel. Today, three weeks later, Brent is down to US$59.59 a barrel and President Trump is congratulating himself on the low oil prices. Instead of shooting up to US$100, oil prices are falling and the U.S. waivers granted to eight large Iranian oil buyers are among the main reasons for this. But how long with the effect of the waivers last?Bloomberg last week published a round-up of how much each of the seven importers that won waivers are allowed to continue importing from Iran and the numbers suggest these seven countries could continue buying over a million bpd of Iranian crude until the waivers expire next year. However, the key word here is “could”.Take Japan, for example. One of the world’s top crude oil importers and a large client of Iran, stopped buying crude ahead of the sanctions to improve its chances of scoring a waiver. Now that it has the waiver, Japanese refiners are still not sure they should resume buying Iranian crude, which makes one wonder why they even worked to secure a waiver if they were not going to use it. Yet theoretically, these refiners can import about 100,000 bpd of Iranian crude, down from 165,000 bpd before the sanctions.South Korea is another reluctant buyer because of its close links with the United States. The country was granted a waiver that would allow it to import Iranian crude at a rate of 200,000 bpd over a period of six months, but refiners have yet to resume imports.  Related: Could Oil Prices Fall To $40?India and China are importing Iranian crude, the former at the allowed rate of some 300,000 bpd, according to order data. The latter, China, was allowed to continue buying Iranian crude at a rate of 360,000 bpd but it also has rights to production from fields in Iran where Chinese companies have stakes, so it may be getting more than that.India is the country that has had to slash its intake of Iranian crude the most and it is also the country that would have the biggest problem finding an affordable alternative to Iranian crude when the waivers expire. India was lucky pessimistic forecasts for the global economy and indications of oversupply pressured prices, but this may only be temporary: OPEC is talking about production cuts again, after all.Other importers would also have to find alternative sources of crude that can compete with Iranian crude on prices. These are, to put it mildly, few and far between since Tehran is selling its crude at a discount to maintain market share. Other producers cannot afford to sell at such discounts. So, what happens when the waivers expire?Importers would have two choices: breach the sanctions and risk Washington’s wrath or switch to costlier crude, which will be even costlier at the time because the end of the waivers will definitely have an impact on prices. These fatter oil import bills won’t do much for these economies’ growth prospects and we just saw last month what pessimistic economic growth prospects do to oil demand outlooks and prices, especially if they concern India and China.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Real-Effect-On-Iran-Sanction-Waivers.html,"Nov 26, 2018 at 13:14 | Irina Slav","Nov 26, 2018",The Real Effect Of Iran Sanction Waivers
