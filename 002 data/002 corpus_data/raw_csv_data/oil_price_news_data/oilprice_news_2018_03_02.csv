2018-03-02,"""The imposition of U.S. oil sanctions is now edging closer to reality. Such a move would act as the death knell for Venezuela's oil industry,"" PVM Oil Associates’ Stephen Brennock said in a note this week. The note followed reports about Washington getting more serious about imposing an oil embargo on the South American nation. But is this really the end for the troubled PDVSA and the country as a whole?This is not the first time such warnings are being made. Venezuela sends much of its oil to refineries on the Gulf Coast. But these shipments have been falling steadily since last year, reaching just 439,000 bpd in the week to February 23, versus 654,000 bpd a year earlier. The reasons for the decline are both lower production and worsening quality of the oil, both caused by lack of cash for field maintenance and the treatment of the oil.The general opinion among industry analysts in the West seems to be that if the White House finally goes ahead with broad sanctions against Venezuela’s oil, the country is as good as dead because of its overreliance on the industry. If these sanctions materialize, Brennock explains, Caracas would have to lower the price of its oil substantially to find buyers and will also suffer the blow of lack of access to diluents, which is essential for making Venezuelan heavy crude marketable.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Oil production in the Orinoco oil belt, responsible for half of Venezuela’s crude oil production of currently around 1.6 million bpd, depends on the imports of heavy naphtha from the United States, which is blended with the thick tar-like extra-heavy oil to allow it to flow through pipelines from Orinoco to Venezuela’s coasts for loading onto tankers.Sure, some analysts say, Venezuela could start importing diluents from African oil producers, but these will come at a steep price, and Caracas is short of cash. In an effort to scrounge up some much needed cash, President Maduro said the country’s brand new cryptocurrency had received more than 171,000 certified purchase offers, of which 40.8 percent were made in dollars. Telesur reports, quoting government officials, that petro sales over the first couple of days of offer topped US$1 billion. But that’s presale days. The real sales will begin on March 20.

From the majority of headlines on Venezuela, one would be left with the very strong impression that the country is already dead and it just doesn’t know it. Yet there is at least one other country that has an interest in not letting this happen. That’s China, of course, and if we add Russia to the ally list, things start to look a bit differently.Both China and Russia have extended massive credits to Caracas. Letting the country “die” is not an option that either Beijing or Moscow would gladly accept. This means that they would more likely than not step in to help keep it on its feet in case of harsher sanctions.So, it may be a little early to talk about death knells and last nails in the coffin of the Venezuelan economy. Chances are that Washington is aware of the role that China and Russia could play there. Otherwise they would have already gone ahead with the broad oil sanctions, despite potential headaches for U.S. refineries.

2018-03-02,"Lately, oil markets have been finely balanced. Both the bulls and bears can make a compelling argument for their respective cases. Russia has vowed not to flood the oil markets while the compliance rates remain high. Inventories have fallen. Prices touched post 2014 highs at $71 a barrel (Brent) and $65 a barrel (WTI). Bears peddle the clichéd, yet not at all insignificant, story of U.S. Shale.The IEA in its recent report said that U.S. oil production could reach 11 mbpd this year. Rigs are being added across the country, taking the total number of oil rigs to its highest level since April 2015. Much of the current situation is thanks to the Vienna deal that saved oil prices after they tanked below $26.One might ask what will become of the markets after the deal expires. In other words, how long can the OPEC-NOPEC producers continue to cap output? With a rising U.S. production and the possibility that one day, and that day might come very soon, the oil producers will open their taps anew. On top of that, the lack of any drastic upbeat demand figures makes a bearish case for oil more than possible.Credit can be given to the technological improvements and resilience of shale producers that kept pumping oil even when prices were low. But the Vienna accord, spearheaded and held together by Saudi Arabia and Russia, still managed to raise oil prices. Both OPEC and Russia have their interests in maintaining a healthy oil price. For every one dollar oil prices fall, Russia loses $2 billion in revenue. OPEC’s leader, Saudi Arabia, needs higher oil prices to ensure the successful IPO of Aramco. For these reasons, the deal was extended last year until the end of 2018. There are chances it might be extended further, but how much?One can make an educated guess that the current production cuts can certainly hold until Aramco’s IPO, which is a huge bet on the country’s future. Once the IPO is done, we might expect weakness in the Saudi resolve to continue the deal. Russian executives are also losing confidence.Last year in November, many energy industry executives expressed their concern regarding rising U.S. shale production. It remains to be seen for how long they can allow others to free ride on their efforts. The IEA reported that the U.S. will be a net exporter of oil and gas by 2022. Revising its estimates, it said that U.S. production will touch 11 mbpd this year (earlier estimates suggested this wouldn’t happen until 2019).Related: Analysts Expect Oil Prices To Rise This YearOther OPEC members are also gearing up to produce again. After signs of tightening oil markets, countries like Kuwait, UAE and Iraq have expressed their ambitions to increase production once the deal expires. Kuwait’s oil minister said that the country will raise its production from 3 mbpd to 3.225 mbpd by end of March. Iraq aims to edge up production to 5 mbpd from 4.6 mbpd by year’s end and Iran says it might add 100,000 bpd after the deal expires. We can be certain that Russians will increase production as well.The members meet in June for a review meeting. Inventory levels are still above the five-year moving average, showing that they have work to do, but some members may be tempted for an early exit.Dr. Mamdouh Salameh, International Oil economist and World Bank Consultant on oil & energy, is positive about oil prices. He says “Oil market fundamentals are positive enough to sustain an oil price ranging from $70-$75 in 2018. By this I mean that the global economy is projected to grow by 3.9 percent in 2018 and 2019 compared with 3.5 percent in 2017 according to the IMF. The global demand for oil is projected to add 1.7-2.0 million barrels a day (mbd) this year over 2017.”Dr. Salameh was very upbeat when discussing the strength of the commitment between Russia and Saudi Arabia, saying that “OPEC and Russia have suffered a great ordeal with the steep decline of oil prices since 2014. That is why they never want to suffer that experience again.”To rely on a single deal that limits production from certain members is not a good idea. Not to mention the fact that the production cuts continue to face challenges in the shape of rising U.S. production offsetting the effects. There is only one way to get out of this vicious circle of supply and price: Demand.The IMF says that the world economy will witness growth this year. Eurozone economy is also picking up. Demand is also expected from India and China. Electrification of transport and policy changes supporting climate change are other factors to consider. The transportation sector is a major consumer of oil. China, with the biggest car fleet in the world, plans to ban conventional cars by 2022. France, India and other countries are following.The recent talks about forming an OPEC Super group, a marriage between OPEC and Russia, has uplifted the sentiments again. However, it remains to be seen whether Russia will go along with this plan. Even if it does, the fact remains that such deals cannot be a permanent solution for stabilizing oil markets.The threat from the U.S. is real and production cuts are not a long term solution to stabilize oil markets.By Osama Rizvi for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Where-Do-Oil-Markets-Go-After-The-OPEC-Deal.html,"Mar 02, 2018 at 17:11 | Osama Rizvi","Mar 02, 2018",Where Do Oil Markets Go After The OPEC Deal?
2018-03-02,"I've had some great interactions with readers lately, be it via blog comments or on Twitter. These discussions inevitably spur on a topic or two to dig into. Hence a recent blog comment has prompted this reply. Hark Och aye, read on! Saldanha Bay in South Africa is home to one of the world's largest crude storage facilities, with a current capacity of 45 million barrels (although more is coming online later in the year). An article published last September said that various trading houses were selling crude from the storage hub after the market had flipped into backwardation (when near-term prices are higher than those further into the future), disincentivizing crude storage – be it onshore or offshore (aka floating storage).googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();At that time, crude leaving the storage terminal was as elusive as the Loch Ness monster.   (Click to enlarge) That said, come November, our ClipperData showed a sudden spike in export loadings from the storage terminal. After exports averaged 590,000 bbls a month through the first ten months of 2017, November's export loadings jumped tenfold to 5.9 million bbls. This was swiftly followed by strength in December, this time of 5.7 million bbls.  Just as quickly as exports popped their head up, they disappeared again. We have seen no further export loadings out of Saldanha Bay since, leaving our chart to look reminiscent of the aforementioned Nessy.(Click to enlarge)While only 1.24mn bbls left storage in Saldanha Bay in 2015,  and 2.1mn bbls in 2016, total exports last year reached nearly 18mn bbls, with two-thirds leaving in the final two months of the year.  Related: Iran Could Lose 500,000 Bpd If Trump Trashes DealAs storing crude became uneconomic, opportunistic purchases were a-go-go. The vast majority headed to East Asia, with China the leading destination, accounting for over 60 percent of the volume. Taiwan also received a few cargoes, while the US has received one: 530,000 bbls to Citgo's Corpus Christi refinery on January 10. (Click to enlarge)The Financial Times reported last week that Saldanha Bay storage had been emptied, according to Vitol's Chris Bake, quoting him saying 'stockpiles at important oil storage hubs such as Saldanha Bay in South Africa have been “emptied” and crude stored on tankers at sea, such as off the coast of Iran and Singapore, is “all gone.”While we concur that floating storage off the coast of Iran has been drawn down (something that was almost complete by April of last year), the reports of the demise of floating storage off Singapore appear greatly exaggerated. Although it has more than halved since mid-last year, we still see around 30 million barrels of crude waiting offshore in the region.By Matt SmithMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/One-Of-The-Worlds-Largest-Crude-Storage-Facilities-Has-Been-Emptied.html,"Mar 02, 2018 at 16:44 | Matt Smith","Mar 02, 2018",One Of The World’s Largest Crude Storage Facilities Has Been Emptied
