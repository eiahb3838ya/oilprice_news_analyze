2018-06-12,"Both Saudi Arabia and Russia recently increased their oil production levels, an indication that they are getting a head start on higher output even as possible changes to the OPEC/non-OPEC agreement remain up in the air.There is growing discord from within OPEC, with Iraq joining a group of those opposed to higher output levels. Iraq’s oil minister said that the objective of the cuts has not yet been achieved, and that Iraq “rejects unilateral decisions made by some producers which do not consult with the rest.” Those comments come after Venezuela and Iran formerly requested solidarity against U.S. sanctions, and lobbed angry statements at Saudi Arabia for seeming to comply with U.S. requests for higher oil production.The solidifying opposition among a solid portion of OPEC against higher output comes even as Saudi Arabia ratcheted up production by somewhere between 85,000 and 161,000 bpd in May, likely taking output back above 10 million barrels per day (mb/d). Russia also boosted production by more than 50,000 bpd in early June. Because the top two oil producers are already starting to increase output, and they are pretty much the only ones in favor of increasing production, the OPEC meeting is shaping up to be highly contentious.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();The oil market is assuming some level of increase at the upcoming meeting, which is why prices have fallen back from recent highs and have remain subdued. But higher OPEC production does not necessarily mean a well-supplied market, nor does it mean that price stability will stick around.There is one major factor that the market seems to be overlooking. Any increase in production will come at the expense of the already limited spare capacity. Saudi Arabia holds the bulk of global spare capacity, which can be defined as a volume of oil that can be called upon at short notice and then sustained for a period of time. Deploying that surplus, while adding supplies to the market, will cut into the buffer.According to Reuters and data from U.S. bank Jeffries, if Saudi Arabia and Russia hike production, global spare capacity would shrink from the current 3 percent of global demand down to just 2 percent. That margin would be the lowest in more than three decades. “You would essentially be taking 3.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of spare capacity down to approximately 2 million bpd,” Jefferies analyst Jason Gammel said, according to Reuters.

The EIA said that OPEC’s spare capacity was only at 1.91 mb/d in the first quarter of 2018, a figure that is assumed to decline over the next year and a half. If Saudi Arabia ramps up output to, say, 10.5 mb/d, as it was before the onset of the agreement at the start of 2017, that would shrink the size of spare capacity siting on the sidelines by a significant 500,000 bpd or so.(Click to enlarge)The Saudis are well aware of the problem. Saudi oil minister Khalid al-Falih said as much last month in an interview with Reuters. “We are concerned about tight spare capacity nowadays,” he said.Up until recently, the massive volume of oil sitting in inventories has acted as a form of spare capacity. That surplus has been well above average levels since 2014, and it has taken an extended period of time to use up that excess. But, we have arrived at that point – the OPEC/non-OPEC production cuts have eliminated the inventory surplus, and inventories could draw down for the rest of this year if the OPEC+ coalition doesn’t increase production.That is why Saudi Arabia and Russia are on the verge of adding supply back into the market. But with the inventory surplus gone, spare capacity now moves front and center. Higher production will directly cut into some of the few sources of supply that can be called upon at a moment’s notice.

That means that a pipeline explosion in Nigeria or Libya, for instance, could send prices skyward. Unexpectedly sharp declines in Venezuela – worse than the market is already taking into account – would have a similar effect. Disruptions to Iranian supply are also possible.Saudi Arabia claims it can produce 12.5 mb/d, or perhaps even more, but analysts question those figures. Because Saudi Aramco’s operations are a closely held state secret, nobody really knows. If Riyadh decides to boost output and run down spare capacity, their capabilities might be put to the test over the next year if there is a major unexpected outage. The oil market would be in for a wild ride.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-This-The-Most-Contentious-OPEC-Meeting-Yet.html,"Jun 12, 2018 at 16:24 | Nick Cunningham","Jun 12, 2018",Is This The Most Contentious OPEC Meeting Yet?
2018-06-12,"Saudi Arabia pumped over 100,000 bpd of crude oil more in May, with daily production reaching 10 million bpd, officials from the country’s oil industry said, as quoted by the Oil and Gas Journal, adding that plans are to add a further 100,000 bpd this month.The news comes on the heels of Russian media reports that the country’s oil production recovered to 11.1 million barrels. This is 143,000 bpd above the country’s quota under the OPEC+ production cut deal, and only about 100,000 bpd below the record-breaking production rate in November 2016, which Russia took as basis for its cuts.In other words, while some analysts still wonder if the reports about Russia and Saudi Arabia discussing a production increase of 1 million bpd are just speculation or an action plan, the increase is already happening and it is making at least one other OPEC member unhappy.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Yesterday, Iraq’s Oil Minister Jabbar al-Luiebi said Baghdad “rejects unilateral decisions by some oil producers without consulting the rest of the members” of OPEC, clearly signaling that Saudi Arabia, leader of the OPEC pack as it may be, is not free to raise production without telling anyone about it.  Related: Can Saudi Arabia Prevent The Next Oil Shock?There are already a lot of signs pointing towards a tough June 22 OPEC+ meeting, with Russia and Saudi Arabia clearly in favor of higher production and Iraq and Iran clearly opposed to it. Iraq is not really in a good position to oppose the raise, however. OPEC’s number-two never complied with its cut quota of 210,000 bpd. In fact, estimates by Platts show Iraq has exceeded its ceiling by the most within OPEC—by some 78,000 bpd since the start of the deal, with compliance at just 63 percent.The upcoming OPEC+ meeting is shaping up as a tough one as some analysts have already warned. When OPEC agreed to cuts, some members, notably Iraq, took quite a lot of convincing that it was necessary to start cutting, and it looks like now they will need equally intensive convincing that it’s time to stop cutting.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Saudis-Lift-Oil-Production-To-10-Million-Bpd.html,"Jun 12, 2018 at 09:31 | Irina Slav","Jun 12, 2018",Saudis Lift Oil Production To 10 Million Bpd
