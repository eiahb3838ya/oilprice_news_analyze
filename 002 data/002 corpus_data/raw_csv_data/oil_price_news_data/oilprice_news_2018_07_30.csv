2018-07-30,"Texas is witnessing a fresh oil boom with June production hitting 4.3 million bpd, all thanks to two things: efficiency improvements and, of course, oil prices. But not everyone is happy about this. The higher efficiency means that fewer new jobs are needed.This is one of the takeaways from the latest Texas Petro Index from the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers, as presented by oil economist Karr Ingham.Oil production over the 12 months to June, Ingham said, rose by an impressive 27 percent, and while not a priority for drillers in the state, natural gas production has also increased. Yet it is taking fewer rigs to pump more oil, and also fewer workers.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();The oil price collapse of 2014 forced producers to bet on efficiency, on doing more with less, and now they are reaping the fruits of their labor: they have learned how to boost production from one single well without adding more rigs. They have also learned to make longer laterals—the horizontal part of the well in the shale rock—and they have learned to pump more sand and chemicals into these laterals.This has led to lower demand for workers as reflected in the Texas Petro Index. As of June, the number of direct upstream jobs in the Texas oil industry totaled 228,600. Some 47,000 new jobs were added after the crisis, which had wiped out as many as 115,000 jobs. Although job creation will continue in the second half of the year, chances are it will continue at the same slow pace compared with production growth.Despite the not so good news about oil jobs, Texas continues to reign supreme in U.S. oil and gas: as of June, the Lone Star State produced 40 percent of the nation’s total oil output and 30 percent of its natural gas output. More than half of active drilling rigs in the United States are in Texas and almost 54 percent of direct upstream jobs are there, too.

The value of oil produced is also substantially higher thanks to the improvement in international prices. However, Texas drillers have their woes as well, and price is one of them.The problem stems from a pipeline shortage in the Permian that has forced local drillers to sell their crude at a discount to get it to refineries—a discount that saw Midland crude trade US$19 a barrel lower than Brent, the international benchmark. This pipeline shortage was a result of the quick expansion of production in the prolific basin after the crisis.The Permian, which produced the bulk of Texas’ oil output at 3.33 million bpd in June, has some of the lowest-cost acreage, which spurred an oil rush there over the last three years. The rush is paying off in terms of production as evidenced by the latest Texas Alliance figures, but both the pipeline shortage and the slow job growth continue to hang over the industry.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Texas-Oil-Boom-Isnt-Creating-Enough-Jobs.html,"Jul 30, 2018 at 13:11 | Irina Slav","Jul 30, 2018",The Texas Oil Boom Isn’t Creating Enough Jobs
2018-07-30,"Iraq’s security troops have dispersed two sit-ins in southern Iraq, one at a key oil field, local media report. The field is West Qurna-1, one of the biggest in this part of the country.Iraqi News cited an unnamed source as saying that protesters had gathered at the field and at the provincial council in Basra and had started preparing for sit-ins before the security troops interfered and forcibly dispersed them.The sit-ins come a day after Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced on his Twitter account the firing of Electricity Minister due to “poor performance”. Blackouts are one of the reasons for the widespread protests that began three weeks ago in Basra and spread across Iraq. At least two previous electricity ministers, Deutsche Welle notes, have been accused of corruption.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Besides corruption, protesters have cited unemployment, poor governance, and alleged Iranian interference in Iraq’s internal affairs. Earlier this month, protesters gathered at three fields in southern Iraq—Rumaila, West Qurna-1 and West Qurna-2—but were quickly dispersed by the police.  Related: Coke, Meth And Booze: The Flip Side Of The Permian Oil BoomThe Basra province, where a lot of the protests are taking place, is home to Iraq’s largest oil fields and accounts for more than 95 percent of the country’s state revenues thanks to oil exports. However, it is also as underdeveloped as most of the rest of Iraq, Al Jazeera notes in a recent overview of the protests, with chronic blackouts, lack of access to clean drinking water, and unemployment.In fact, what sparked the protests was a sudden cut in Iranian electricity supplies to Basra in early July. The cut came during a heat wave that prompted thousands of locals to take to the street, also prompting them to share their other grievances. According to Al Jazeera, Iran cut exports to force Baghdad to pay its dues for electricity supplied. Since then, protests have been growing despite efforts by the government to quash them and its promise to address the grievances.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Iraq-Security-Forces-Disperse-Oil-Field-Sit-Ins.html,"Jul 30, 2018 at 10:57 | Irina Slav","Jul 30, 2018",Iraq Security Forces Disperse Oil Field Sit-Ins
2018-07-30,"Aramco is unlikely to suspend West-bound crude oil exports after the Houthi missile attacks against two Saudi tankers in the Bab el Mandeb strait, The National reports citing oil analysts. Riyadh announced that it would stop shipments via the chokepoint after the attacks, and this sparked worry that Saudi exports would be disrupted, raising prices.However, it is unlikely that Saudi Arabia would allow such a dent in exports.“Overall Saudi export volumes should not be reduced by this decision, although there will be some short-term disruptions and the announcement has created concerns in the crude market and related areas such as shipping insurance,” Richard Mallinson from Energy Aspects said.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Some of the alternative routes that Saudi oil could be shipped through include the maritime route via the Horn of Africa, which is longer and more expensive, and the East/West Saudi pipeline to the Yanbu refinery on the Red Sea. From Yanbu, the crude could be shipped via the Suez Canal, Iman Nasseri from Facts Global Energy told The National.In any case, for a while Saudi exports to the West will be more expensive, but this should not be a major problem for Aramco. The company only ships around half a million barrels daily via the Bab el Mandeb chokepoint, compared to an average daily total of 6 million barrels.

While in the past the main risk in the area came from African pirates, the war in Yemen has added the risk of missile attacks from the Arabian Peninsula as well.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Saudis-Wont-Suspend-Oil-Exports-To-The-West.html,"Jul 30, 2018 at 09:09 | Irina Slav","Jul 30, 2018",Saudis Won’t Suspend Oil Exports To The West
