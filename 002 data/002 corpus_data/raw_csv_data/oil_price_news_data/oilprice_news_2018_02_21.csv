2018-02-21,"Just a decade ago, few could have imagined that the U.S. would be producing more than 10 million bpd of crude, but with the explosion of shale production, that is exactly where we are.In what can only be seen as a complete U-turn in policy and mindset, the south-north flow of imported oil is poised to become the north-south flow of exports. This about turn must of course be borne out by logistics and practicalities first, as aging infrastructure that was designed primarily with ship-to-shore movement in mind requires a significant overhaul if it to meet this reverse demand.The consequences of this shift are already being revealed, as trading volumes in WTI futures surged ahead of those of Brent, and trading of U.S. oil future contracts has doubled in the last decade. What formerly acted more as an indicator of inventories is now being seen as a benchmark for traders and shippers, and the spread between WTI and Brent is narrowing.At this rate of production increase, the U.S. is set to overtake Russian crude output in late 2018, making it the foremost global supplier. At $60 per barrel, drilling companies can afford to develop their equipment and techniques, while at the same time keeping shareholders happy.Just how long it can last is open to debate, but with the stagnant output of North Sea oil seemingly unable to meet the rising demand in developing markets such as Asia, the boom of U.S. oil production shows no sign of slowing.Rather than being crippled by OPEC's attempt to flood the market, North American shale seems to have taken this challenge in stride, and even become stronger, faster and more efficient as a result. Couple this with U.S. crude’s more dynamic pricing system and it isn't hard to see why WTI futures are overtaking futures like Brent and Dubai.  Related: Frac Sand Shortage Threatens Shale BoomThe gap in production that OPEC is attempting to create is simply being filled by U.S. shale, so it seems that not only did OPEC shoot itself in the foot by forcing the price to $26 per barrel, it is compounding that mistake by allowing the U.S. to flood the market itself.Saudi Arabia remains unconcerned, and the U.S. lacks the infrastructure to deliver anything near the volume that it does to China, but the very fact that it is shipping any oil at all amply demonstrates the U.S.’s position in the global oil trade.No longer a slave to the market according to OPEC, the U.S. finds itself in the enviable position of being in control of its own oil supply. When oil prices are high it can ramp up production, thereby both saving money on expensive imports and capitalizing on high exports. Should prices fall again, it can take advantage of low import costs, and scale back production until it reaches a favorable level.What this means for OPEC is that its power is a mere shadow of what it was in the 1970s. Its influence of the global oil trade is evaporating, and its reliance on oil wealth is something that is looking untenable at best. The rising dominance of Russia and the U.S., coupled with the global shift away from oil consumption means that it must diversify its income if it wants to survive. The Aramco IPO may just be the very beginning of that process.Related: U.S. Crude Exports Hit A Major MilestoneWhat we’re seeing is more than just the U.S. reversal from energy dependence to energy dominance, but a complete transformation of the global market.The elastic production, diverse crude quality, vast storage ability, integrated trading capabilities and concentrated refining capacity that has come about from the boom in shale oil output all amount to energy independence, but crucially they mean that the U.S. is able to dictate the market on its own terms.This luxury was barely conceivable a decade ago, but it’s looking more and more like the shape of things to come.By Gary Norman for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-US-Oil-Industry-Sets-Its-Sights-On-Asia.html,"Feb 21, 2018 at 12:51 | Gary Norman","Feb 21, 2018",The U.S. Oil Industry Sets Its Sights On Asia
2018-02-21,"Saudi Arabia is undergoing a truly seismic shift in its economy, politics, and society, all thanks to the oil price crash of 2014. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, commonly referred to as MBS, would likely not have had the opportunity to initiate the sweeping changes envisaged in Vision 2030 had it not been for the price collapse. Now, Riyadh needs oil prices to rise as high as possible for the plan to succeed — and is even ready to tip the market into a deficit to that end.Saudi Arabia used to be OPEC’s most influential price dove, according to Bloomberg’s Grant Smith. Now, the kingdom has adopted a markedly different approach. Saudi Arabia is now focused on pushing prices as high as it can for a very simple reason: Aramco’s IPO.There are more than enough doubts surrounding the listing of the world’s largest oil company. There’s no certainty about the location of its international listing, and some observers have even argued that Riyadh might opt for a private placement instead so as to ensure the entire 5 percent that is set to be offered will find a buyer.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Aramco’s IPO is crucial for Vision 2030, as the proceeds from the sale will be the fuel that this ambitious plan runs on. While analysts disagree strongly on exactly how much Aramco is worth, it’s clear that the higher oil prices are, the higher the valuation for this oil giant will be.After a strong rally at the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, Brent and WTI have both fallen from their multiyear highs, as the fast growth in U.S. shale production offsets the OPEC cuts. Despite OECD inventories nearing their five-year average, oil prices are refusing to rally. In fact, some analysts are warning that the price slide we saw this month is only the beginning of a much bigger decline.Related: Saudi Arabia Wants $70 OilRiyadh doesn’t want to hear this prior to the IPO. It’s not something the Saudis want to hear in the coming years either, because the price of oil doesn’t just need to be higher now — it needs to remain high in the near to medium term to ensure the Aramco IPO’s success.So, what’s an oil kingdom to do? Last week, Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih suggested that OPEC should change the way it measures global inventories because the current method produces unreliable data. The current method is based on the five-year average inventory level for the members of the OECD. But that five-year average is a moving target, as OilPrice’s Nick Cunningham recently noted, and in the last five years it has reflected a substantial glut. So, based on the five-year OECD average, the market rebalancing may turn out to be a reduction of the overhang as opposed to an impressive reduction in the global oil glut.Of course, there’s always the possibility of a conflict in the Middle East driving oil prices up — but geopolitical unrest is far from a guarantee. The recent unconfirmed (and likely to never be confirmed) reports about Saudi Arabia working together with Israel to thwart Iran’s growing influence in the region were followed this week by an open warning from Tel Aviv that it’s ready to confront Iran directly, and Iran issuing an in-kind threat that promised to “level Tel Aviv.” For oil price analysts, these growing tensions can never be ignored.Another factor that no producer can control is demand. For now, demand forecasts are overwhelmingly rosy, but some observers are wary of too much optimism. Higher prices themselves are a negative factor for demand growth.So, Saudi Arabia is once again ready to do whatever it takes to push prices up. But in an increasingly complex oil market, it remains to be seen if the oil kingdom can achieve its lofty goals.By Irina Slav for OilPrice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Saudis-Ready-To-Swing-Oil-Market-Into-Deficit.html,"Feb 21, 2018 at 11:55 | Irina Slav","Feb 21, 2018",Saudis Ready To Swing Oil Market Into Deficit
