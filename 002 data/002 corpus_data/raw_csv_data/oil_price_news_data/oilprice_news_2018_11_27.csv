2018-11-27,"Donald Trump continues to take credit for lowering oil prices.So great that oil prices are falling (thank you President T). Add that, which is like a big Tax Cut, to our other good Economic news. Inflation down (are you listening Fed)!Trump’s tweetstorm complicates the OPEC+ meeting in Vienna next week. Trump is very much leaning on Saudi Arabia, pressuring them not to cut output. And he has gone out of his way to protect the Saudis even though the CIA has concluded that crown prince Mohammed bin Salman likely ordered the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. He clearly expects the Saudis to return the favor by not cutting production.This puts Riyadh in a bind. Saudi Arabia needs to patch up its relationship with the West, but it also can ill-afford oil prices at current levels. Saudi Arabia needs Brent to trade north of $80 per barrel for its budget to breakeven. Massive budget deficits during the 2014-2016 downturn help explain Riyadh’s about-face in late 2016 – they had tried to force high-cost drillers out of the market by crashing oil prices, but ultimately caved and engineered an OPEC+ production cut to push prices back up.  Related: How President Trump Is Undermining U.S. Oil ProducersLittle has changed since then. Saudi Arabia’s spending commitments are still large, and that is before we even take into account MbS’ overly-hyped economic reform proposals. Saudi Aramco is also trying to figure out how to transform itself for the long haul. There was the much-ballyhooed Aramco IPO that has since been shelved. There were the plans for Aramco to issue one of the largest corporate bond offerings ever in order to finance a major stake in Sabic, the state-owned Saudi chemical firm. That initiative was also recently abandoned. Now, Aramco’s CEO says the company will spend $500 billion to transform itself into a global refiner and chemical maker.That is going to require a lot of money, which means that the Saudi government desperately needs a rebound in oil prices. But that goal could run afoul of the American president, who just bailed them out over the Khashoggi murder.The murder of Jamal Khashoggi put a lot more in jeopardy than merely low oil prices. MbS, after several years of glowing press in the West, put his country’s strategic alliance with the U.S. at risk when he (according to the CIA) ordered the assassination of Khashoggi. Now, with only Trump vouching for MbS, amidst a push by the U.S. foreign policy establishment to throw the crown prince under the bus, the Saudis have little room to anger the White House. That potentially means giving up on the more aggressive oil option floated a few weeks ago – a cut in OPEC+ production on the order of 1.4 mb/d.  Related: The Biggest Losers Of The Current Oil Price SlumpThe Wall Street Journal reports that the latest plan hatched in Riyadh is a so-called “quiet cut” in Vienna, which consists of a re-dedication to the original OPEC+ production cuts, emphasizing a return to 100 percent compliance. Because Saudi Arabia is now massively overproducing, by about 1 million barrels per day (mb/d), a return to the prior production target would translate into a sizable 1 mb/d cut.“It will be still a big cut but less pronounced,” a senior Saudi oil adviser told the WSJ. The report suggested that this plan was “gaining traction among OPEC officials this week.”The “quiet cut” would be an attempt to thread the needle. It would be small enough that it might keep Trump happy. It would also be small enough that Russia could sign on. Moscow has been more reluctant than the Saudis to slash output. But it would be large enough for Saudi Arabia – and large enough, in theory, to arrest the meltdown in prices.“It is quite a political move. The last thing Saudi Arabia wants to do at the moment is to risk upsetting Trump,” the senior Saudi oil adviser told the WSJ.The sudden sensitivity about how its actions are perceived by Washington demonstrates the far-reaching fallout of the Jamal Khashoggi murder. MbS has sacrificed a ton of leverage at the OPEC+ meeting, and more importantly, he has essentially given up full control over Saudi oil policy, for little gain.“Because of Khashoggi, the Saudis will do anything to make sure Trump doesn’t do anything nasty” to them, an OPEC official told the WSJ.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/How-Much-Oil-Production-Will-The-Saudis-Cut.html,"Nov 27, 2018 at 17:15 | Nick Cunningham","Nov 27, 2018",How Much Oil Production Will The Saudis Cut?
2018-11-27,"Three countries currently account for close to 40 percent of global crude oil production and only one of these countries is a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The three are Russia, the United States, and Saudi Arabia and as their clout over oil markets increases with rising production rates, OPEC’s is set to decline, at least temporarily.Reuters’ John Kemp noted in a recent column on the topic that the so-called troika now called the shots more than ever before: all three countries produced north of 11 million bpd a day in October, a record high and more than the combined production of the rest of OPEC. And, according to OPEC, this state of affairs will continue to develop in a direction unfavorable for OPEC with the troika’s combined production rising to over 40 percent of the global total this year while OPEC’s share falls below 30 percent.Each of the three producers has its own oil production policy that is relatively independent of other producers’. True, Saudi Arabia and Russia have been playing on the same team for the last two years to a large extent because the game strategy has been mutually beneficial. Yet we have seen abundant indications that the moment the interests of the two begin to diverge each is likely to drop the team game and pursue its own priorities. The U.S. in the meantime has become the single largest swing factor outside the OPEC+ club with relentlessly rising production that could push it to the top spot globally next year.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();This production will only continue to rise if OPEC now decides to start cutting production once again in order to push prices higher, further strengthening the U.S.’ importance on the global oil market. So, does this all mean OPEC is as good as dead? For the time being, mostly yes. Most of its members, as Kemp notes, fall in one or more of the following categories: “is struggling under sanctions, mismanagement and unrest; is too small to matter; is maximizing production rather than participating in output controls; or simply aligns its output policies with those of Saudi Arabia.”  Related: $50 Oil Puts Shale To The TestThe future remains uncertain, however. Most respectable forecasters such as the Energy Information Administration and the International Energy Agency are upbeat about the growth of oil demand, but the upbeat forecasts come with conditions: the IEA most recently said in its World Energy Outlook that producers will need to up investments in new conventional production substantially to be ale to respond to this demand. Failing that, the U.S. would have to increase its shale oil production by as much as 10 million bpd in the seven years to 2025, which is a bold target, to say the least.OPEC members are obvious candidates for some of this production growth. Despite a lot of worry around the cartel’s spare capacity earlier this year when it became clear the cuts need to be reversed to rein in prices, some of the members, such as Iraq and Libya, are on track to grow their production. True, this growth will likely be nowhere near the more than a million bpd that U.S. producers have added in the past year, but it could be substantial in the case of Iraq, if the political and price conditions allow it.What’s more, Venezuela and Iran are unlikely to spend the rest of eternity under sanctions. There is a possibility, however, remote at the moment, that these two could at some point reverse the decline in production they are experiencing now. Iran has already demonstrated it could ramp up pretty quickly if given the chance. In other words, OPEC’s clout on oil markets may be waning but it might be too early to bury the cartel for good just yet.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Oil-Powerhouses-Replacing-OPEC.html,"Nov 27, 2018 at 17:10 | Irina Slav","Nov 27, 2018",The Oil Powerhouses Replacing OPEC
2018-11-27,"The civil war in Syria has resulted in government-controlled areas being deprived of domestic oil. Before the war, Eastern Syria produced 95 percent of the country’s oil. Today, Syrian government forces have been forced to source oil from external actors to power the country. Last week, the Trump administration exposed a complicated scheme involving companies and individuals in Russia, Iran, and Syria working together to transport oil to the necessary areas. Sanctions have now been announced concerning those accused of participating in this complicated Iranian-Russian plan to smuggle oil.The schemeThis oil smuggling scheme has, allegedly, been in place since 2014, transporting millions of barrels of oil to war-torn Syria. Damascus, in turn, has facilitated the transfer of hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp’s Quds Force to Hamas and Hezbollah. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declared “Today we are acting against a complex scheme Iran and Russia have used to bolster the Assad regime and generate funds for Iranian malign activities”.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();The critical actor within this plan has been Mohammad Amer Alchwiki and his Russia-based company, Global Vision Group. The Syrian national Alchwiki was central to both the delivery of oil to Syria and the transfer of funds via Iran’s Quds force to Hamas and Hezbollah. The source of the alleged ‘malign’ activities is the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) which provided the money.In order to conceal the source, the CBI apparently used Iran-based Tadbir Kish Medical and Pharmaceutical Company to transfer money to Alchwiki’s Global Vision Company. The companies both have a bank account at the Mir Business Bank in Russia which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Iran’s Bank Melli. The front company is a ‘medical’ organization, meaning it adheres to humanitarian needs so that sanctions do not apply.In Russia, Global Vision has an agreement with Promsyrioimport, a subsidiary of the Russian Ministry of Energy (Minergo). The Russian company facilitates the purchase and shipment of Iranian oil purchased from the National Iranian Oil Company to Syria. Transport is extra precarious as some of the ships have been insured by European companies and allegedly have turned off their beacons since 2014 to conceal their destination.  Related: Mexico’s Oil Crisis Deepens(Click to enlarge)In addition, Alchwiki has also acted as a conduit for Tehran to transfer money to proxies in the region. Using his international connections at the CBI and Mir Business Bank, he has been an interlocutor on behalf of the Syrian government. As with the oil scheme, the CBI played a central role by providing the necessary funds.Confronting IranIt has been the Trump administration’s policy to confront Iran, and these sanctions are further evidence of that. The U.S. withdrawal from the Iran Nuclear Deal was the prelude of opposing Tehran in political, economic, and diplomatic areas. Washington’s success has been mixed.Politically and diplomatically, President Trump’s actions unified an unusual alliance of global powers including Russia, China, France, Germany, and the U.K. in maintaining the Nuclear Deal. The U.S. has also tried uniting several Arab states in what has been called ‘the Arab NATO’. This initiative isn’t yet the success it was hoped to become, primarily due to the blockade of Qatar by several other members. The awkward collaboration of these Arab countries seems to be motivated by appeasing Trump rather than confronting Iran.  Related: The Real Effect Of Iran Sanction WaiversOn an economic level, Washington has had more success in confronting Iran. After the signing of the Nuclear Deal, many companies showed a willingness to invest in the country. The reimposition of sanctions, however, made many companies reconsider their investment plans. Most notable of those companies was French energy giant Total which abandoned its massive South Pars LNG project.Although the U.S. has granted temporary sanction waivers to eight countries to import Iranian oil, it is highly unlikely these will be extended. The prime reason for Washington’s decision was its fear of increasing the price for oil by depriving the market of 1.5 million barrels of Iranian oil. Currently, Tehran is under pressure as the economy is failing and protestors are taking to the streets.Despite the difficulties Iran is facing, many analysts believe Tehran will be able to ride out the storm. Despite the recent drop in prices, the country is aided by relatively high oil revenues and the inability of Trump to form a united coalition as the Obama Administration managed with the previous nuclear agreement.These new sanctions will not have the desired effect of crippling the Syrian economy or depriving Assad support of Moscow and Tehran. It is likely that oil shipments will continue while the U.S. itself faces increasing pressure from a confrontational Turkey in Eastern Syria vis-à-vis the Kurdish YPG.By Vanand Meliksetian for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Stopping-Syrias-Oil-Smuggling-Scheme.html,"Nov 27, 2018 at 16:43 | Vanand Meliksetian","Nov 27, 2018",Stopping Syria’s Oil Smuggling Scheme
2018-11-27,"The ongoing slump in oil prices, which has seen crude fall so sharply from the 52-week high set in October that $1 trillion has been wiped off energy stocks, will cut deep into the pockets of major producers like Saudi Arabia, Russia, Nigeria and Angola. As the world heads into an “unprecedented time of uncertainty” in oil markets, however, it’s not only OPEC members who will suffer. Even countries who are less naturally exposed to fluctuations in oil rents, such as Malaysia and Canada, are more vulnerable than usual to the current oil price crash thanks to poor policymaking.Record lossesAs recently as early October, Brent crude was trading at almost $87 per barrel, amid predictions of $100 a barrel. Since then, the commodity has endured an unprecedented run of losses. Affected simultaneously by a glut in supply and a drop-off in demand, oil is now valued at almost half of what it was two months ago, after recording its biggest single-day drop in three years.The projected decrease in supplies precipitated by American sanctions on Iranian oil has failed to materialize, thanks to the Trump administration unexpectedly issuing waivers for eight countries, including major importers China and India. More worryingly, this abundance in supply may only account for roughly 15 percent of the current slump in prices, with the rest caused by depressed demand linked to sluggish economies.OPEC under pressureAs the industry holds its breath hoping that the December 6th meeting will stabilize crude prices, lethargic demand is far more concerning than outsized supply, as OPEC countries do not have direct control over it. Indeed, it’s estimated that OPEC was responsible for only 15 percent of the global increase in oil production between October 2017 and October 2018, while several of its biggest members are struggling to break even: de facto cartel leader Saudi Arabia needs oil prices to average out at $70 just to balance the books. Smaller OPEC countries are even more exposed: Nigeria and Angola, for example, rely on crude for more than 80 percent of their exports.Other emerging markets endangeredIt’s unsurprising that those emerging markets whose GDP depends on oil will suffer bitterly as crude prices plummet. Less widely analyzed, but just as troubling, are countries which have left themselves vulnerable to an oil slump through their own policy choices rather than an abundance of petroleum resources.  Related: Legendary Oil Trader Expects Crude Prices To ReboundFor example, after years of weaning itself off of petroleum dependence, Malaysia is newly threatened by the oil price crash, thanks to risky policy decisions from its Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad. Since the 93-year-old ex-strongman regained the premiership in May, Kuala Lumpur has bled $3 billion in foreign investment over apprehension that he will continue the same controversial economic policies which characterized his first stint as PM from 1981 to 2003.Mahathir has not assuaged those concerns by scrapping the goods-and-services tax (GST) which constituted roughly 20% of governmental revenue. Malaysian finance officials have raised alarm about the GST’s abolition, emphasizing that the previous government had instituted the tax to reduce the country’s dependence on petroleum and to shore up the Malaysian economy in case of another oil price crash.Mahathir’s expansionary 2019 budget had counted on oil rents to patch the hole left by the abolition of the GST. Unfortunately, this plan required state oil and gas giant Petronas to fork over an extraordinary special dividend—a proposition which prompted Moody’s to downgrade Petronas’ outlook to negative—and assumed a Brent crude price of $72 a barrel—a figure that, less than a month after the budget was released, seems dangerously optimistic.Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has lampooned the budget, noting that his administration had planned its finances around a crude oil price $18 below the global rate out of prudence: “if the conditions improve, we will get a bonus. If it gets worse, we would have already made preparations”. With Brent breaching $60 and Petronas dragging down the Malaysian stock exchange, Mahathir’s administration may regret not having made such preparations.Canada’s calamitous infrastructural problemsMalaysia’s beleaguered premier is not the only leader whose poorly-crafted policies have left his country unnecessarily exposed to the whims of the oil market. Bottlenecks have been building in Alberta for years as more crude is extracted from the Athabasca oil sands than existing pipelines can carry, an issue Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government has failed to address.Trudeau made a risky bid to cancel the Northern Gateway pipeline in favor of the Trans Mountain project, which would have tripled the amount of petroleum products being shipped out of Alberta. The PM’s gamble backfired in August, when Canada’s Federal Court of Appeal blocked construction on Trans Mountain. With the Keystone XL and Energy East projects also sidelined—the latter likely for political reasons rather than concerns about profitability—Trudeau has been left facing mounting criticism and an ever-deepening oil crisis in Canada’s richest province.  Related: A Unique Play In SolarOttawa’s seeming inability to see a pipeline project to completion means that Canada has an overabundance of crude oil with nowhere to ship it to, forcing Canadian producers to sell oil at a steep discount. This is a particularly serious problem when global prices are already sinking—Canadian oil recently fell to just $13.46 per barrel, the cheapest worldwide.The differential between Canadian and global oil prices means that Alberta is losing a staggering $100 million per day, a loss which is not only hamstringing future investment in the industry, but imperiling the entire nation’s economy. Under Canada’s system of revenue sharing, Ottawa counts on some $22 billion from oil-rich Alberta to distribute to less affluent provinces.Stormy waters aheadCanadian coffers are bleeding at an alarming rate as global oil prices drop, with no end in sight to the predicament. With U.S. shale output expected to reach record levels next month and continue growth into the 2020s—though America is hampered by its own pipeline capacity problems— the ongoing supply glut could suppress oil prices for the foreseeable future.The remarkable recovery in oil prices since the last crash in 2016 allowed oil producers, both inside and outside OPEC, to breathe a sigh of relief. Regrettably, it also gave countries like Malaysia and Canada breathing room to pursue policies which have left them needlessly vulnerable to crude’s next downward swing.By Richard Talley for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Biggest-Losers-Of-The-Current-Oil-Price-Slump.html,"Nov 27, 2018 at 15:26 | Richard Talley","Nov 27, 2018",The Biggest Losers Of The Current Oil Price Slump
2018-11-27,"Prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) remain weak going into what forecasters are claiming will be a warmer than usual winter season in the Northern Hemisphere. In fact, last week spot prices for the super-cooled fuel in Asian tumbled some 10 percent, hitting three month lows, an uncharacteristic development for this time of year. Reuters, citing traders, said that LNG spot prices for January delivery in North Asia LNG-AS were estimated at $10 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), 90 cents lower than last week.Factors continuing to put downward pressure on prices include warmer temperatures, LNG storage levels in the world’s top three LNG importers (Japan, China and South Korea) remaining high and plunging Brent oil prices which long term LNG contracts are mostly linked to. Though spot purchases are not usually linked to oil prices, they often follow either oil prices upward or downward trajectory. A Singapore-based trader said that “the big question mark right now is how the weather will pan out as the market will quickly turn once it starts to get cold. But until then, it’s tank-top (inventory levels) right now in many places.”LNG doldrumsgoogletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Japan's weather bureau earlier this month said the El Niño weather pattern appears to have formed and that there was a 70 percent chance it would continue into the Northern Hemisphere for spring. Meanwhile, a U.S. government forecast predicted a 80 percent chance of El Nino lasting in the Northern Hemisphere unto spring. El Niño is a climate cycle in the Pacific Ocean that occurs every five years or more which has a global impact on weather patterns. The cycle begins when warm water in the western tropical Pacific Ocean shifts eastward along the equator toward the coast of South America.Global oil prices are also putting downward pressure on LNG prices as oil prices have pivoted in just a little more than a month after hitting the mid $80s per barrel price point for global benchmark Brent crude and the mid $70s price point for U.S. benchmark, NYMEX-traded West Texas Intermediate Crude (WTI) crude futures.Prices are now 30 percent off recent highs amid concerns of a growing supply glut widening from record oil output in the U.S., Russia and Saudi Arabia and after Washington issued sanctions waivers to several countries for their Iranian oil imports.  Related: Goldman: Oil Prices Set For Rebound In 2019This extra supply comes as demand growth is projected to dampen amid economic downturn from the ongoing trade war between Washington and Beijing and continued sluggish economic growth in emerging economies. A robust U.S. dollar is also eating into demand for oil since oil is traded in dollars and a strong greenback adds to the cost of oil imports, hitting particularly hard countries like India, the Philippines, Indonesia and others. However, weaker oil prices over the last month has offered some respite for oil import dependent countries.The third reason that LNG spot prices in Asia are tumbling is that storage levels, as already mentioned, are full - particularly in China as energy planners in Beijing try to avert a repeat of last year’s fiasco when the government sought to replace coal with cleaner burning natural gas during the winter too quickly, resulting in a shortage of natural gas and the diversion of the cleaner burning fuel from industrial end users to residential users.As far back as August, China began filling underground gas storage tanks, including state energy giant PetroChina, operator of the Xiangguosi storage facility, injecting gas from Myanmar to fill the vast chambers 3,000 meters (9,900 ft) under the mountaintop. Reports said at the time that China was aiming to turn hundreds of tapped and some still producing wells into storage facilities after a severe winter supply crunch left it short of the clean-burning fuel.By Tim Daiss for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Three-Reasons-Why-LNG-Prices-In-Asia-Are-Plunging.html,"Nov 27, 2018 at 11:32 | Tim Daiss","Nov 27, 2018",Three Reasons Why LNG Prices In Asia Are Plunging
2018-11-27,"OPEC will probably agree to cut production to the tune of between 1 and 1.5 million bpd, analyst Johannes Benigni from Austrian JBC Energy Group told CNBC, adding there was clearly a glut on global oil markets at the moment and such a cut would likely help the market to return to balance.“OPEC will probably manage to stabilize the oil market by choosing the right language,” Benigni said. “They will indicate a cut of between 1 million and 1.5 million, and that will do, the market probably will stabilize.”It’s somewhat surprising how fast the market swung into excess after in June, OPEC and Russia agreed to stop cutting production and to begin to ramp up as prices climbed to uncomfortably high levels for some major importers. This month all three biggest producers globally hit new records, with Saudi Arabia’s daily production rate exceeding 11 million bpd for the first time ever.  Related: $50 Oil Puts Shale To The Testgoogletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();The latest production data from the Kingdom, Russia, and the United States has pressured prices in addition to gloomy demand outlooks, and the talk about production cuts started by Saudi Arabia has not been able to apply sufficient counter pressure.Yet if these talks end with a decision to start cutting, price movement could be reversed. What’s more, the glut is not across all grades, according to JBC Energy Group’s chairman said.“What really are in oversupply are the light crude barrels which are coming out of the U.S.,” he said. “So the expectation or the hope for OPEC right now would be that prices go lower, and demand may come back.”But others are skeptical that this will be so easy to do. In a note to clients, Jefferies said today “The oil price correction has become a rout of historic proportions,” as quoted by Reuters. “The negative price reaction is as severe as the 2008 financial crisis and the aftermath of the November 2015 OPEC meeting, when the group decided not to act in the face of a very over-supplied market,” the investment bank said.
