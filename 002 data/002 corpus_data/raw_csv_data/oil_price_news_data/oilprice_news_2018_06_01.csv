2018-06-01,"We are still in a period of headline risk in financial markets generally. Stocks, bonds and currencies are all reacting to news on subjects as diverse as trade, North Korea, and Italian politics. Neither Italian political turmoil nor an on again, off again relationship with North Korea are anything new, but the prospect of an escalating trade war has traders in every market worried.The bond and currency markets are reacting as you might expect, with the U.S. 10 Year yield falling and the Dollar gaining ground as the “risk-off” trade gathers pace. (Click to enlarge)Both have seen a bounce off obvious levels, 95 for the Dollar Index and 2.75 for 10 Year yields, but for now the trends remain intact.Stocks are a different story. U.S. equities are holding up remarkably well and remain close to the top of an upward recovery channel that has been in place since April. The feeling seems to be that healthy corporate profits and reasonably strong economic data trump (if you’ll forgive the pun) the headline risks.(Click to enlarge) Geopolitics:As always, geopolitical risk as it relates to oil is focused on the Middle East. The Trump administration seems to have picked a side in the ongoing conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran, increasing the risk of the proxy wars between the two rivals in Yemen and Syria growing into full-blown open warfare. However, with the Saudis now getting U.S. support they will probably be content to wait and see the effects of renewed U.S. sanctions and, as this article at foreignpolicy.com posits, that also makes aggression from Iran far less likely.All in all, more simmering looks more likely than a full blow-up so the upward pressure on oil that we have seen recently from the Middle East will fade into the background for a while.The situation in Europe brings on a sense of déjà vu. It is eerily reminiscent of 2012, when the many announcements of the death of the European Union were somewhat premature. There is some risk here, but history suggests that this too shall pass.Supply:The geopolitical situation in the Middle East has, of course, been a major factor in supply considerations in recent days and while that has influenced WTI on several occasions, the main upward push has been in Brent. Even more fuel has been added to that by the OPEC led cuts in production have remained in place despite some reports of problems.

In reality though, the rig count steadied last week after six weeks of gains and the EIA numbers showed a larger than expected draw on inventories.Demand:The potential effects of a trade war loom large. The effectiveness of the OPEC led production cuts has been magnified by the improving prospects for global growth, and that is now at risk. However, this too comes under the category of headline risk. Consistency has not been a hallmark of the Trump administration so far, and there have already been several changes of tone of the tariff issue. Another could easily prompt a quick reversal in oil.Technical Factors",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Expect-A-Bounce-In-WTI-Prices.html,"Jun 01, 2018 at 15:45 | Martin Tillier","Jun 01, 2018",Expect A Bounce In WTI Prices
2018-06-01,"Rosneft increased its crude oil production by 70,000 bpd over the last two days, the company told investors, in preparation for an OPEC+ decision to start easing production quotas, Bloomberg reports, citing Russian asset manager Renaissance Capital.The company has a spare production capacity of between 120,000 and 150,000 bpd, and its average daily production during the first quarter was 4.57 million bpd.According to Rosneft’s press service, the company is still producing with the quota assigned it under the OPEC+ deal but the fast ramp-up is a clear indication Russia’s largest oil producer is eager to return to higher daily rates, especially after the sevenfold increase in attributable net profit in the first quarter thanks to improving prices. At the release of the Q1 figures, Rosneft said it could quickly bring back production of 100,000 bpd.Last week oil prices started sliding down after reports quoting Saudi Arabia’s and Russia’s energy ministers as saying the two are considering relaxing the production quotas in light of the continuing decline in Venezuela’s oil production and the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions against Iran.In an interview with Bloomberg, Alexander Novak said no decision has been made yet about relaxing the quotas. The decision, he said, will be made no earlier than June 22. The UAE’s Oil Minister, Suhail al-Mazrouei, said that this decision would have to be unanimous as well.

Saudi Arabia’s daily average is also rising, hitting the highest in seven months last week, according to tanker tracking data cited by Bloomberg.Citigroup commodity analysts earlier this month estimated that Russia has 408,000 bpd in idled capacity, which constitutes 4 percent of its total, which stands at 11.3 million bpd. That’s a lot less than Saudi Arabia’s idle capacity, which stands at 2.12 million bpd, but is apparently still a significant enough portion of the total.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Rosneft-Throws-OPEC-For-A-Loop-Boost-Output-By-70000-Bpd.html,"Jun 01, 2018 at 09:13 | Irina Slav","Jun 01, 2018","Rosneft Throws OPEC For A Loop, Boosts Output By 70,000 Bpd"
