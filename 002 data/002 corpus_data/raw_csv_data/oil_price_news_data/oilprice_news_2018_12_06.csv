2018-12-06,"The United States became a net oil exporter last week for the first time in 75 years, and even if it is likely to be for just one week, the achievement highlights the increasing global influence of the soaring U.S. crude oil production.According to Bloomberg and data from the American Petroleum Institute, the United States had been a net oil importer since 1949.In the week to November 30, however, the weekly U.S. net imports of crude oil and petroleum products were at minus 211,000 bpd—meaning that the U.S. was a net exporter of that amount, according to data from the EIA.So far in 2018, the U.S. net oil imports have averaged around 2 million bpd, while the record net oil imports of 14.370 million bpd was set in November 2005.In crude oil only, U.S. crude oil exports surged to a record high of 3.203 million bpd last week, as oil production also soars to record highs. According to weekly data from the EIA, U.S. crude oil production kept at a record 11.7 million bpd throughout November, although these numbers are likely to come off a bit in the monthly estimates. Production at 11.7 million bpd is more than what each of Russia and Saudi Arabia pumped in November, although the Saudis are also expected to have reached record highs in their production last month.Saudi Arabia, as leader of OPEC, and Russia, its key partner in the production cut deal, are in the midst of deliberating new oil production cuts to rebalance an oversupplied market.U.S. President Donald Trump continues to call on OPEC to keep oil prices low, because “The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!”.But a no-deal or an underwhelming agreement on Friday could send oil prices further down, potentially hurting production growth in the U.S. shale patch.

2018-12-06,"As oil markets hold their breath for OPEC+’s announcement of the final production cuts to take place starting next year, the Energy Information Administration served a nice surprise to oil bulls by reporting an inventory draw in crude oil of 7.3 million barrels for the week to November 30.The report came two days after the American Petroleum Institute disappointed bulls with an estimated inventory build of 5.36 million barrels for the same week, pushing WTI prices down closer to US$50 a barrel.The EIA said refineries processed 17.5 million barrels of crude daily last week, producing 9.7 million bpd of gasoline and 5.6 million bpd of distillate fuel. A week earlier, refineries processed 17.6 million bpd, with gasoline production at 10.2 million bpd and distillate fuel production at 5.5 million bpd.Gasoline inventories last week added 1.7 million barrels, with distillate inventories rising by 3.8 million barrels. This compared with an 800,000-barrel decline in gasoline inventories and a 2.6-million-barrel rise in distillate fuel inventories a week earlier.Oil has been on the slide this week, pressured by uncertainties surrounding this round of OPEC+ production cuts and the surprise announcement by Qatar that it was leaving the cartel starting in January. There has been speculation that Iraq, OPEC’s second-largest producer may follow as it cannot really afford to reduce its production.A stock market dip accelerated the oil price drop, but trading was not particularly dynamic ahead of the OEPC meeting in Vienna. The cartel will release a statement later in the day, but Russia has yet to have its say, which will take place tomorrow. Its position is considered once again the maker or breaker of the cut deal, although the prevailing mood is positive, with a high degree of certainty that an agreement to reduce crude oil supply will be reached.At the time of writing, Brent crude traded at US$59.49 a barrel, with West Texas Intermediate at US$50.74 a barrel, both down since opening.UPDATE: OPEC failed to reveal a solid agreement in Vienna after hours of meetings.

2018-12-06,"The joint ministerial committee of OPEC and non-OPEC ministers that oversaw the production cuts from 2017 and the first half of this year has once again recommended that the cartel and its partners reduce crude oil production, TASS reports, citing the energy minister of Oman, Mohammed bin Hamad Al Rumhy.""We just agreed on the reduction. Actually, the level of reduction will be discussed in the next two days,"" Al Rumhy told media in Vienna. Later today, however, OPEC will come out with a statement on the topic that will reveal its final position on the cuts amid a lot of internal disagreement.Tomorrow, Russia and several other non-OPEC producers will join the talks and the amount of the cuts—if agreed—will be specified. Al Rumhy said he believed OPEC+ could reduce its combined output by 1 million bpd. The agreement will be in force for six months, the minister also said.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Talk about cuts began last month, initiated by Saudi Arabia amid slumping oil prices. Analysts projected cuts in the range of 1 to 1.4 million bpd but most acknowledged this time it might be harder for the Kingdom to get everyone on board. Iraq is not the only one that can’t really afford the cuts: Iran has stated it will not discuss its production quota while under sanctions and Russia has made it clear it was fine with prices where they are. Yet president Putin said at the G20 meeting cooperation between Russia and Saudi Arabia would continue, which suggested Russian oil companies will join the cuts.If Saudi Arabia and Russia prevail in the discussions, the only issue would be the size of the cut unless Iraq decides to quit the cartel altogether, as Barclays’ David Cohen suggested in a chat with CNBC. If that happens, whatever cuts are agreed would have about the same effect on prices as the entry into effect of U.S. sanctions against Iran after market players had months to prepare for them.UPDATE: OPEC failed to reveal a solid agreement in Vienna after hours of meetings.
