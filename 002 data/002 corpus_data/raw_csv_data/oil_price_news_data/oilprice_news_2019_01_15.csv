2019-01-15,"The oil supply surplus is “starting to reverse,” according to a new report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The investment bank noted that oil prices had collapsed in late 2018 not only because of an oversupply problem, but also because of other “non-fundamental factors,” including the selloff of long positions by hedge funds and other market managers, as well as by fear and uncertainty in broader financial markets. Still, the bottom line was that the oil market saw a glut once again emerge in the fourth quarter.However, “now the 1.3mn b/d surplus in 4Q18 is starting to reverse,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts wrote in a January 10 note. In fact, the bank says that the OPEC+ cuts could translate into a “slight deficit” for 2019. “With investor positioning reflecting a bearish set-up, Brent prices have already bounced back above $60/bbl, and we retain our $70/bbl average forecast for 2019,” BofAML wrote.Oil price forecasts vary quite a bit, but a dozen or so investment banks largely agree that the selloff in late December, which pushed Brent down to $50 per barrel, had gone too far. BofAML is betting that Brent rises back to $70 per barrel.However, the investment bank issued a rather significant caveat. This assessment is based on the assumption that the global economy does not take a turn for the worse. BofAML analysts said that Brent could plunge as low as $35 per barrel if global GDP growth slows from 3.5 percent to 2 percent.At this point, it is anybody’s guess if the global economy slows by that much, but there is a growing number of indicators that at least suggests such a deceleration is possible. The recent data from China showing a shocking slowdown in both imports and exports is discouraging. Exports fell 4.4 percent in December from a year earlier, while imports crashed by 7.6 percent, suggesting that the world’s second largest economy is starting to weaken a bit.  Related: There’s No Sugarcoating Canada’s Oil CrisisNevertheless, the oil market fundamentals, as they stand, do not look overly bearish. Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimates that supply from OPEC+ will fall by a whopping 2.6 million barrels per day (mb/d) in the fourth quarter of this year compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. That figure includes the 1.2 mb/d of agreed upon cuts, plus substantial losses from Iran and Venezuela. Those significant declines, combined with slower U.S. shale growth and a steady increase in demand, should be enough to tip the oil supply balance into deficit territory, BofAML concludes.“On a net basis, we see aggregate [year-on-year] global oil supply growth of just 400 thousand b/d in 2019 and a deficit building into the summer months,” the bank said. Moreover, the supply surplus that did emerge in late 2018 was much smaller than the one that occurred between 2014 and 2016. The most recent surplus totaled perhaps 200 million barrels, compared to around 1-billion-barrel surplus in the 2014-2016 period, according to Scotiabank. In that context, erasing the glut should be easier to achieve.

Waivers granted to countries importing oil from Iran expire in May. The top U.S. official dealing with Iran sanctions, Brian Hook, hinted at the same conference in Abu Dhabi that the American government wouldn’t be as lenient this time around. “All I can say is that certainly when we have a better supplied oil market, then that will put us in a better path to [reducing Iranian crude exports] to zero,” Hook said.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Markets-Could-See-Deficit-In-2019.html,"Jan 15, 2019 at 13:55 | Nick Cunningham","Jan 15, 2019",Oil Markets Could See Deficit In 2019
2019-01-15,"The U.S. government is planning on taking a tougher line on Iran in the months ahead, redoubling its efforts to cut Iran’s oil exports down to zero.Brian Hook, the State Department’s special representative for Iran, boasted earlier this week about the U.S.’ success in curtailing Iran’s oil exports to date. In an interview with Bloomberg, Hook noted that when the Trump administration withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal last May, Iran was exporting 2.7 million barrels per day (mb/d). Now, he says, Iran’s exports are down near or below 1 mb/d.“In fact, in those first six months, we took off roughly a million barrels of oil. We did that without increasing the price of oil,” Hook told Bloomberg in an interview.“There’s a lot more to come. We are going to continue our path to get to zero,” Hook said, referring to the administration’s goal of zeroing out Iran’s oil exports. However, when pressed on when that might happen, Hook demurred, telling Bloomberg that the campaign to zero also needs to be balanced against U.S. national security and economic interests.There’s the rub. Cutting Iran’s oil exports to zero was always going to be tricky because it would likely contribute to significant increase in oil prices. In fact, the U.S. decided in November to issue sanctions waivers to eight countries importing oil from Iran precisely because it was worried about the effect on oil prices.This time around, to be sure, there is a lot more room for the Trump administration to maneuver. The oil market entered into a state of surplus in the fourth quarter, a development that stemmed from the ramp up of supply from OPEC countries in anticipation of major outages from Iran. The surplus could allow the U.S. to take a harder line, tightening the screws on Iran further.“We are not looking to grant any new waivers. That’s been our policy from the beginning,” Hook said. “We are not looking to grant any exceptions to our campaign of maximum economic pressure.” He conceded that such an effort to be stingier with waivers is contingent upon oil prices. The U.S. granted six-month waivers to Japan, South Korea, India, China, Taiwan, Turkey, Italy and Greece. They expire in May.  Related: Middle East Gas Game Accelerates As ENI Wins ConcessionsIran’s oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said the sanctions are “fully illegal” at a news conference in Iraq on January 10. “We believe that we should not comply with the illegal sanctions against Iran,” Zanganeh said.The problem for the U.S. is that it still hasn’t figure out a way to reconcile the twin goals of low oil prices and zero exports from Iran. The same puzzle that bedeviled American officials last fall remains. Even though the oil market is well-supplied now, that could change in the months ahead.Saudi Arabia, having felt a little burned by the Trump administration in November, helped engineer another round of OPEC+ cuts in December. Saudi Arabia alone will cut output by around 800,000 bpd from October levels, taking production basically back to where it was before the U.S. asked it to increase supply to offset losses from Iran.In other words, the recent oil supply glut seemingly gives the U.S. government more leeway to take a harsher line on Iran, but OPEC+ is already cutting output, which will take away some of that leeway.To make matters more complex, the U.S. government has sent very mixed signals about its approach to the Middle East. A few weeks ago President Trump announced a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, and has expressed a desire to reduce American commitments to the region. That was followed by a damage control tour of the Middle East by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton, both of which sought to dial back Trump’s stated goal of troop withdrawal.  Related: Fears Of U.S. Shale Demise May Be OverblownMeanwhile, the New York Times reported that Bolton has been itching for a reason to go to war with Iran, and that his request to draw up military options against Iran has raised concerns within the Pentagon.As for oil, there are also mixed messages. Trump’s personal desire seems to be low oil prices at all costs. But Bolton, along with Mike Pompeo and Brian Hook, all want to ratchet up the pressure on Iran.How this shakes out remains to be seen, but the hawks might feel constrained if the oil market continues to tighten. Oil prices are up more than 20 percent from their December lows, but are still rather low. If oil remains at current price levels, the hawks in the Trump administration could have room to maneuver.But if the OPEC+ cuts begin to drain the surplus, and oil prices steadily rise over the next four to five months, the Trump administration may be back to where it was in October – feeling a little too skittish about cutting Iran’s oil exports to zero because of fears over driving oil prices too high.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Tough-Line-On-Iran-Depends-On-Crude-Prices.html,"Jan 15, 2019 at 13:52 | Nick Cunningham","Jan 15, 2019",U.S. ‘Tough Line’ On Iran Depends On Crude Prices
2019-01-15,"Just a few months ago Canadian heavy crude oil producers were sending their product to storage amid a painfully deep price discount to West Texas Intermediate that ate into their margins. Chinese refiners took advantage of the cheap Canadian crude and stocked up as well while it was cheap. Now, some are worrying about a shortage of heavy crude that would interfere with the operations of Gulf Coast refineries that process more than 50 percent of the world’s heavy crude oil.Bloomberg reports some heavy crude grades such as Heavy Louisiana Sweet are already trading at a premium to lighter and typically more expensive grades because of this concern, which seems like it has further to grow. Others are shrinking their discount to Brent and WTI.In December, Alberta’s Premier Rachel Notley ordered a crude oil production cut in the province of 325,000 bpd to clear up stockpiles and prop up the price of the local benchmark. This worked even before the cuts entered into effect, which was at the beginning of this month, but it also coincided with OPEC’s latest production cut agreement. More notably, it coincided with Saudi Arabia’s early production cut start.“Historically, when the Saudis have cut output, it’s heavy and medium crude,” a senior analyst from consultancy Turner Mason & Co. told Bloomberg’s Robert Tuttle and Sheela Toben. This means lower heavy crude production in Canada has combined with the consistent decline in Venezuelan oil output, unlikely to be reversed in the observable future, and now with expected lower heavy and medium crude production from Saudi Arabia. No wonder prices are spiking.  Related: Fears Of U.S. Shale Demise May Be OverblownHeavy crude, according to Bloomberg, accounts for a tenth of the feedstock of refineries around the world. Asian refiners will suffer from the shortage just as much as their U.S. counterparts if it materializes, if not more. But it will also present an opportunity for alternative suppliers of heavy crude, such as Mexican producers if the premium of the usual supplies goes high enough to make these alternative sources of crude competitive. Russia is also a large producer of heavy crude and well positioned to up its deliveries to Asian markets.While analysts expect the rally to be temporary as the refining industry gears up for the new, low-sulfur bunkering rules of the International Maritime Organization, it has certainly highlighted Canada’s pipeline conundrum. There is robust demand for Canadian heavy crude from U.S. refiners, but not enough capacity to transport it across North America to the Gulf Coast cheaply. The good news for Canadian producers is that cheap or not, if the refineries need it, the refiners will buy it.The news is good for Saudi Arabia as well, as whatever heavy crude it produces will fetch more per barrel than before. Venezuela, however, is in no position to enjoy higher revenues as most of the oil it exports heads for China and Russia under cash-for-oil agreements signed in the past. Mexico would also reap some benefits despite plans by the new government to refine more crude locally than export it: these are long-term plans that need refining capacity. In short, stakeholders set to benefit from the price rise in heavy crude will likely try to make the best of it while it lasts.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Heavy-Crude-From-Glut-To-Shortage.html,"Jan 15, 2019 at 13:45 | Irina Slav","Jan 15, 2019",Heavy Crude: From Glut To Shortage
2019-01-15,"Italian oil and gas major ENI has left other international oil majors behind as it has been awarded a long-range of new concession agreements with Abu Dhabi’s national oil company ADNOC, Sharjah’s national oil SNOC and Bahrain’s national oil and gas authority NOGA. In a surprise sweep, the Italians beat Asian and Western competitors for several major offshore opportunities, bringing the company in as one of the major players in the Arabian Gulf constellation. After the retreat of Dutch oil major Shell, the main European giant taking the lead until now was French oil and gas major Total, currently ruling almost all of the UAE’s offshore and onshore sector. Despite the fact that Asian and even Russian parties are showing interest in the region and are quickly scooping up stakes, the Italian success has come as a surprise to some. Until now, the biggest news from ENI has been related to its gigantic success in the East Mediterranean, where it has seen a string of offshore gas discovery successes in Egypt. It now seems that an Italian Prima Vera could be in the making offshore the United Arab Emirates.(Click to enlarge)Building on its growing capabilities and success stories elsewhere, ENI has now been awarded by ADNOC a 70 percent stake in two exploration areas offshore Abu Dhabi. The Italians are seen to be monetizing the positive sentiment in the market that stems from this string of successes. ADNOC and ENI have signed two Concession Agreements for the acquisition of a 70% stake in the Offshore Block 1 and Offshore Block 2 exploration areas, The Italian major will be taking the concession as a majority leader in a consortium with Thailand’s PTT Exploration and Production Company (PTTE) for a period of 35 years, which is at present seen as a very long period, showing the willingness of all parties to form a long-term cooperation. As stated by ADNOC, the two blocks, located in the north-west of the Abu Dhabi Emirate, are the first blocks to be awarded among those that were offered for commercial bidding in April 2018. ADNOC still holds the option to take a 60 percent stake in the concession, a decision to be taken after a commercial discovery. As stated by ADNOC, Eni will operate the concessions and invest with PTTEP over AED 844 million (US$ 230 million) to explore for oil and gas and appraise the existing discoveries in the two blocks, which cover a combined area of approximately 8,000 square kilometers.  Related: Saudi Oil Minister: No Need For Extraordinary OPEC MeetingENI’s CEO Claudio Descalzi said: “This award represents a new important step towards Eni’s expansion in one of the world leading region for the oil and gas industry, not only by participating in producing fields, but also by exploring new blocks. In particular, Offshore Blocks 1 and 2 will have synergies with the Ghasha offshore concession. This further reinforces the partnership between Eni and ADNOC and Eni will make available its exploration expertise and leading edge technology to untap additional resources in the offshore of Abu Dhabi”. The choice for ENI by ADNOC fits well into the strategy currently set up by ADNOC’s CEO Sultan Al Jabr targeting Oil & Gas 4.0. This new policy seeks to leverage new technology and capabilities to improve and expand oil and gas production on and offshore in the UAE. ENI is not new to Abu Dhabi, as the company was awarded, in 2018, a 10 percent stake in the Umm Shaif and Nasr Offshore concession plus a 5 percent stake in the Lower Zakum concession as well as recently a 25 percent stake in Ghasha concession.  Related: There’s No Sugarcoating Canada’s Oil CrisisThe Italian sweep extends even further, as ENI was awarded three long term onshore concessions by the Sharjah National Oil Corporation (SNOC). The latter awarded Areas A, B & C concessions as part of the 2018 Exploration Bidding Round. Concession Area A and C cover an area of 437 kilometers squared and 1,184 kilometers squared respectively. The Italians, as operator of Area A, will hold a 75 percent participating interest, while SNOC will take a 25 per cent stake. In B Eni takes a stake of 50 percent, with SNOC being the operators.(Click to enlarge)Snowed under by the ENI UAE successes, the market should however keep an eye on Bahrain in the coming years. ENI signed this weekend also a deal with Bahrain’s National Oil and Gas Authority (NOGA) to pursue petroleum exploration in the offshore exploration area Block 1, which is by and large an unexplored offshore area covering 2,800 square kilometers in the northern territorial waters of Bahrain. ENI is expected to start its first drilling in 2019. It will be very interesting to see what the current ENI move into Bahrain really entails. It will be no surprise to link the current concession agreement (1) of ENI to a possible involvement in the upcoming decision by NOGA and Tatweer about the approach towards the 80 billion barrels of offshore shale oil reserves decision in 2019. Currently exploration drilling is ongoing on the offshore shale reserves on which commercial viability and technical discussions will be held. A final investment decision is to be expected H2 2019. An Italian involvement looking at the last agreement could be already on the table.By Cyril Widdershoven for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Middle-East-Gas-Game-Accelerates-As-ENI-Wins-Concessions.html,"Jan 15, 2019 at 11:14 | Cyril Widdershoven","Jan 15, 2019",Middle East Gas Game Accelerates As ENI Wins Concessions
2019-01-15,"International exchange operator CME Group has teamed up with Enterprise Products Partners to launch an electronic trading platform specifically focused on spot contracts for American crude oil for export, Reuters reports.Scheduled to go live in March, the platform will offer trading in light sweet crude from Midland, Texas, home of the Permian shale play that significantly helped U.S. producers boost their output to all-time highs, turning the country into the largest oil producer in the world.The cargoes to be auctioned by Enterprise Products Partners will be loaded at the Enterprise Houston Ship Channel, CME Group said, adding “The electronic auction will provide a competitive and transparent venue for firms across the world to efficiently hedge U.S. crude oil.”The contracts will be priced on the basis of West Texas Intermediate futures. The crude to be sold will come from the Permian to the Gulf Coast via the Midland-to-ECHO pipeline system, which can carry 575,000 bpd of crude to the ECHO terminal in Houston, which can store up to 7.4 million barrels of oil.Last year U.S. crude oil exports hit a record 2.2 million bpd. The figure was hailed as the beginning of a new era that could eventually see the world’s top consumer—and top producer for 2018— export up to almost 4 million bpd. Since then, daily export rates have fallen, especially after August when Chinese refiners began winding down their purchases of U.S. crude amid the trade war between Washington and Beijing.This year, however, could see a rebound in U.S. shipments of crude to Asia. Freight costs are down palpably, and this has made U.S. crude more competitive without other sources. Stable demand for heavy crude among Asian refiners and a possible shrinking in the availability of heavy grades from Canada and Saudi Arabia could also boost demand for U.S. oil.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/CME-To-Start-Selling-US-Export-Crude.html,"Jan 15, 2019 at 07:49 | Irina Slav","Jan 15, 2019",CME To Start Selling U.S. Export Crude
