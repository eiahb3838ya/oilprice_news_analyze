2018-04-11,"The rally in oil prices over the past year likely had more to do with higher demand rather than merely the supply taken off of the market by the OPEC/non-OPEC cuts. That suggests that as OPEC tries to formulate a strategy going forward, perhaps targeting a certain price level, much of the success of that campaign will depend on the global economy and the pace of oil demand growth.That conclusion comes from a new report published by the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies (OIES). The report parses out some of the variables determining prices in recent years, dividing the recent past into four main cycles: 1) OPEC defending market share (2013-2015); 2) OPEC’s high output/low-price strategy to drive out shale (2015-2016); 3) OPEC/non-OPEC cuts (June 2016-April 2017); and 4) OPEC’s strategy to drain stocks (May 2017-present).Throughout these four stages, one interesting conclusion is that the demand story is incredibly important, arguably more important than the market realizes, in driving the price of crude. The last half-decade, the focus in the media and among analysts is usually on the supply picture (U.S. shale growth, for instance, or the OPEC cuts), but evidence suggests a slowdown in demand or unexpected strength tends to have just as much influence, sometimes more.Let’s rewind to phase one. Between 2013 and 2015, the cartel was producing flat out in an effort to defend market share and drive U.S. shale producers out of business. The high levels of supply were definitely a key driver in the crash in oil prices. But the demand story was also important. Between late 2013 and early 2015, OIES estimates that Brent crude lost roughly $38 per barrel due to the combined tidal wave of U.S. shale and higher OPEC production. Still, it wasn’t just a supply story. The slowdown in the global economy also led to the loss of $26 per barrel.  Related: Russia Wants To Drop Dollar For Oil PaymentsWhen U.S. shale started to crash in 2015 and the early part of 2016 (phase two), the supply losses from the U.S. added the equivalent of $12 per barrel back to Brent. But again, the poor economic performance and weaker demand – despite lower oil prices – took off a whopping $20 per barrel from Brent (there are other factors moving prices up or down, but supply shocks and demand growth are paramount).To be sure, OPEC and its non-OPEC partners agreed to remove upwards of 1.8 million barrels per day of supply off of the market in late 2016 (phase 3), but initially, at least, the fundamentals did not reflect this fact. Member countries ramped up output just ahead of the start of the deal at the end of 2016, flooding the market just ahead of the cuts. The price increases, then, were the result of speculation in anticipation of the cuts. Brent posted losses when the speculative euphoria wore off. Higher U.S. shale and poor OPEC compliance resulted in a loss of $5 per barrel over this period, which is notable because strong demand had the effect of adding $6 per barrel over the same timeframe. Again, a demand story.Finally, in phase four (mid-2017 to present), the supply picture has been muddled because much higher OPEC compliance has been occurring at a time when U.S. shale was ramping up. OIES estimates that shale growth probably depressed prices by $4 per barrel in 2017, while higher OPEC compliance added $1 per barrel in the second half of the year. In the first half of the year, the OPEC cuts had very little effect because of poor compliance and front-loaded growth.OPEC and shale somewhat offset each other in 2017. But the crucial message from the OIES report finds that in 2017, soaring global demand, coming on the back of a strong economic expansion (3.7 percent GDP growth), adding roughly $12 per barrel to the price of Brent crude.OIES says the “success” of OPEC’s strategy “has been largely demand-driven, as was the ‘failure’ of its previous high-output strategy during the 2015-2016 cycle.”In other words, OPEC’s effort to flood the market in 2015 and 2016 helped knock back U.S. shale, but it occurred at a time when the global economy sputtered, and the “bad timing” led to a crash in prices. Meanwhile, while OPEC took barrels off of the market last year, significant price gains had more to do with the strong economy.This isn’t just a bit of interesting history – it offers lessons going forward for OPEC as it considers its options. “A key factor that should be shaping the current OPEC oil policy is the expected strength of global demand growth,” OIES wrote. “Oil prices in 2018 more sensitive to the downside to a downward revision of global demand growth rather than an equivalent upward revision of US shale supply growth.”  Related: Crude Build Stalls Oil Price RallyOIES estimates an unexpectedly weak economy, for instance, could drag oil down by $5 per barrel while an unexpectedly strong increase in shale supply would only push prices down by $2.50.Practically speaking, then, the prospect of a trade war should loom larger than one might think for OPEC because it could endanger GDP growth. To compensate for a weak economy, OPEC would need to cut an additional 1 mb/d, according to OIES, while to compensate for surging shale, OPEC would only need to cut 0.5 mb/d to have the same price effect.Obviously, for OPEC, strong demand is desirable. It would allow the group to keep the cuts in place for as long as it wants and then phase them out. However, OIES says that if global demand surprises to the downside, “OPEC choices become very stark: OPEC could either decide to cut output or shift towards a higher output strategy. Both choices carry hefty risks reflecting delicate situation that OPEC finds itself in.”By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Strong-Demand-Not-OPEC-Is-Pushing-Oil-Prices-Higher.html,"Apr 11, 2018 at 17:05 | Nick Cunningham","Apr 11, 2018","Strong Demand, Not OPEC, Is Pushing Oil Prices Higher"
2018-04-11,"Crude oil inventories at Cushing ticked up slightly to 36 million barrels for the week ending on April 6, but still hovered near lows not seen in several years.Throughout the oil market downturn that began in 2014 and lasted through much of 2017, inventories at Cushing bounced around roughly between 50 and 65 million barrels. Cushing’s inventory levels have now been slashed by nearly half, a sign that the oil market continues to tighten.But there is more to the story. As Reuters points out, Cushing’s importance as an oil hub is rapidly diminishing. While there is of course some oil production in Oklahoma, Cushing’s significance has always been larger than a mere storage site. Cushing’s original importance was as a gathering hub for crude oil streams from all over – from various oil fields in different parts of the U.S., from imports coming from Canada and Mexico, and from elsewhere.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();As the “pipeline crossroads of the world,” Cushing’s larger significance was its role as the home of the WTI benchmark.But the physical oil upon which WTI is based is no longer moving to Cushing, at least not the way it did in the past. The oil hub is far from the coast where there are refineries and export terminals, and it is also rather far from the shale fields in West and South Texas.It’s not just that U.S. shale has burst onto the scene in the last few years and shifted the geographical landscape of production. Arguably, a more crucial factor was the lifting of the U.S. crude oil export ban, which for decades had trapped oil production within U.S. borders.Oil exports are now steadily on the rise. In the last week of March, U.S. oil exports jumped above 2 million barrels per day, up from negligible levels a few years ago and from an average of 1.1 mb/d in 2017 (although there is great variation from week to week). The revamping of several Gulf Coast export terminals, such as Corpus Christi and the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) also have heightened the importance of moving oil to the coast.

Again, that means producers are trying to ship as much of their oil and gas to the Gulf Coast as possible.With everything flowing in the same direction, the Permian in particular is starting to run into bottlenecks, a problem that could yet slow the region’s supply growth. Several pipelines are in the works and when completed, they will solidify an even greater tie between West Texas and the Gulf Coast, diminishing Cushing’s importance. Genscape estimates that takeaway capacity from the Permian will jump by two-thirds by the end of next year, from 2.7 mb/d to 4.5 mb/d.Moreover, as Reuters notes, the Dakota Access pipeline started operations in 2017, allowing Bakken crude to bypass Cushing.In other words, the Gulf Coast is emerging as a more important oil hub than the one in Cushing, which will increasingly be cut out of the picture. U.S. oil production is sky-rocketing even as inventories in Cushing are at multi-year lows. While Cushing stocks currently stand at about 36 million barrels, a level of about 20 million barrels is effectively “empty,” according to Reuters, because a certain amount of oil must be kept on hand to blend with other grades as well as to keep infrastructure working properly.As Reuters reports, some oil traders are clamoring to replace WTI as the all-important benchmark for the oil market, because WTI is derived from real-world supply conditions in Cushing. Instead, a benchmark based on physical oil flows in Houston might make more sense.  Related: The Oil Eating Bacteria That Can Clean Up Crude SpillsWTI is still one of the world’s most traded commodities, and it is the basis for a long line of other less-traded benchmarks, who discount their oil relative to how WTI is trading. A switchover to a Houston-based benchmark would be no small matter. But even if it takes time, it might be inevitable. “That’s the direction it’s moving,” Joshua Wade, a crude oil marketer in Oklahoma, told Reuters. “As opposed to importing, now you’re exporting through the same infrastructure ... The oil capital of the nation is in Houston.”By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-The-Cushing-Oil-Hub-Still-Relevant.html,"Apr 11, 2018 at 16:58 | Nick Cunningham","Apr 11, 2018",Is The Cushing Oil Hub Still Relevant?
