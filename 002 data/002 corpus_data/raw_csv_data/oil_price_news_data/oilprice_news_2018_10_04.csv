2018-10-04,"One of the few variables that could spoil the oil prices, which many see destined to climb higher, is the pitfalls facing global demand.Global synchronized growth already came to an end earlier this year, although the U.S. is still going strong. However, it remains to be seen how long that can last, with the juice from the tax cuts set to wear off, tariffs raising consumer prices, a rise in retail gasoline prices and interest rates grinding higher.But, the real danger to global oil demand is higher oil prices themselves, which to be sure, isn’t exactly a revelatory conclusion. However, while Brent crude surged to $85 per barrel, up from the mid-$60s at the start of the year, the price increase is astronomically higher in emerging markets, where currency weakness has wreaked havoc.For instance, in Brazil, the real has lost around 20 percent of its value this year, a plunge that occurred at the same time that oil prices were rising. The one-two punch has translated into soaring prices for fuel. Bloomberg notes that in Brazilian reais, oil prices are now sharply above the 2008 all-time record high for oil prices. And not just by a little bit – prices are 50 percent higher than that peak. It’s no wonder that the country was crippled by fuel protests a few months ago, a series of events that forced the government to backtrack on market reforms for fuel prices. U.S. motorists may complain about higher prices at the pump, but they have no idea.The story is similar in India, Indonesia, South Africa, Mexico and Poland, to name a few. In Mexico, oil prices in pesos are also above the 2008 peak. Incoming President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has looked at re-regulating retail gasoline prices.India, no stranger to protests over fuel, is also seeing unease. The government is hoping to stick to its fuel pricing reforms, but next year’s presidential election is putting the Modi government under a lot of strain.

Consumption is mostly flat in the U.S. and Europe.But, while it is easy to observe the fact that fuel prices have skyrocketed in emerging markets, the hard part is trying to figure out how this impacts demand.“The market appears to be extremely sensitive to perceived threats to the maintenance of demand growth,” Standard Chartered said in a note. “We believe it is likely these concerns that have keptBrent crude prices closer to USD 80/bbl than USD 90/bbl.” The bank said that global oil demand growth dropped to a 21-month low in June at just 469,000 bpd above June 2017 levels.However, this may have been an anomaly. The following month, demand grew at its strongest rate in over a year. “[W] do not expect global demand weakness to unbalance the market; it would take significant economic discontinuity for demand concerns to pull prices significantly lower, rather than just taking the edge off them,” Standard Chartered concluded.Still, it is hard to ignore a growing number of economic problems. Inflation in Turkey rose yet again in September, and is up near its highest level during the Erdogan era. That comes despite interest rate hikes from the central bank. The inability to get a handle on inflation might prompt more rate tightening. That should push the economy down even more. Obviously, the sharp plunge in the Turkish lira this year, combined with higher global crude oil prices, is contributing to this problem.Argentina has seen its own currency crisis, prompting a wave of capital flight. Argentina received a bailout from the IMF, but in return the IMF demanded a well-worn prescription of austerity measures, which seem only to ensure that economic misery continues.  Related: Should The U.S. Oil Industry Fear The Midterms?Then there are a few economic landmines that have yet to erupt. The U.S-China trade war shows no sign of slowing. If anything, things will continue to deteriorate, with U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods rising from 10 percent to 25 percent at the end of the year. President Trump has threatened to go beyond that, and plans to do so could be in the works for tariffs on an additional $267 billion. China’s response last month was narrower, although it included a 10 percent levy on imported LNG from the United States. Crude oil was left off the list, but China may be saving that for the next round.Another potential black swan is the economic problems in Italy, which could spark a rerun of the stress on the Eurozone. Italy is now run by euro-skeptics, and while there is no formal push for an “Italexit,” the markets are clearly worried. High public debt, exposure from Italian banks, anemic growth and the rise of anti-European sentiment all create plenty of risk. The spread on Italian 10-year bonds has widened recently.Not to be outdone, the official Brexit still looms in the months ahead with talks deadlocked and Prime Minister Theresa May facing threats to her rule from former allies.In short, there are a plethora of pitfalls for oil demand. For now, the warning signs are just warning signs. Most analysts still expect strong demand growth in 2019, although slightly less than this year.In the meantime, supply shortages continue to dominate headlines, with Iran at the top of everyone’s minds. “Nothing matters between here and Nov. 4,” said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho in New York told CNBC, referring to the date for implementation of the U.S. sanctions on Iran.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-No1-Pitfall-For-Oil-Prices.html,"Oct 04, 2018 at 17:06 | Nick Cunningham","Oct 04, 2018",The No.1 Pitfall For Oil Prices
2018-10-04,"Big Oil—and its smaller competitors—attracted a lot of praise for their tight financial discipline during the last three years, after Brent collapsed from more than US$100 a barrel to less than US$30 in less than 24 months. Some actually thought this may be the new normal: financial discipline, tight belts, and careful scrutiny of any new projects. Reality seems to have proven them wrong.Reuters reported this week that big oil companies’ boards are under increasing pressure to boost spending, expand production, and increase reserves. That’s just three years after everyone in oil woke up to the fact that Brent was going nowhere but down for a while longer and belts started tightening. Now, with Brent at US$85 and climbing, these belts are getting too tight, it seems. Despite pledges made by the chief executive officers of the biggest oil companies in the world, the strict financial discipline they had imposed during the rough years might now have to be relaxed.Reuters quoted sources from the sector that said various departments within them were asking for more money, videoconferencing was being replaced by face-to-face meetings, which are costlier because of travel expenses, and offshore platform rotas are being shortened, which raises logistics costs. All this suggests Big Oil is relaxing and is ready to start spending more again.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Moody’s in July said in a note to clients the five biggest oil companies would spend 5 percent more in 2019 than in the current year. The ratings agency, whose note Forbes’ Gaurav Sharma quoted in a July story, said higher oil prices were helping Big Oil report more substantial profits and these profits, in turn, were spurring a more upbeat attitude towards higher expenditure.Does this sound familiar? It must, because that’s how all oil cycles have worked. Hopes—and assurances from the industry—that this time everything will be different may very well have been premature and overoptimistic. Reuters’ John Kemp put it succinctly in a commentary from April: “The oil industry has been characterised by deep and prolonged boom-bust cycles since the first modern well was drilled in 1859. Deep cycles are the natural condition of the oil industry and there is no reason to think the future will be any different.”  Related: Is China Turning Trump's Oil Weapon Against Him?The oil industry cannot escape from its cyclical nature no matter how many mistakes it learns from, but there are two areas that really do require higher spending and there are doubts that Big Oil will be able to provide it, regardless of the current oil price rally. These two are reserve replacement and climate change.Reuters reported in its story that the oil field decline rate accelerated from 3 percent in 2014 to 6 percent in 2016. Sure, spending cuts had something to do with this, but there is also such a thing as natural depletion that has nothing to do with spending: finite resources. So, higher spending to ensure stable production in spite of the doomsayers eager to usher in a totally renewable era in energy is inevitable.Yet, higher spending on cleaner energy is also inevitable: Big Oil has been increasingly vocal about its commitments to the world of tomorrow where oil and gas will be a much smaller part of the energy mix. To live up to their promise, these companies will need to spend twice as much on “new energy” as they are spending now, Morgan Stanley warned in a report from last month cited by Bloomberg. In this context, it would be safe to say that Big Oil is entering the next stage of the new cycle and it will be spending more in the coming years. Until the next price drop, that is.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Big-Oil-Is-Back-On-A-Spending-Spree.html,"Oct 04, 2018 at 16:05 | Irina Slav","Oct 04, 2018",Big Oil Is Back On A Spending Spree
2018-10-04,"As U.S. sanctions on Iran have forced some countries to stop importing oil from Iran, crude oil prices have inevitably risen. The U.S. started down this path earlier this year when President Trump announced the withdrawal from the Obama-era Iran nuclear agreement.Some sanctions went into effect in August, but the sanctions with potentially the most significant global implications go into effect in November, when the sanctions target Iran’s oil exports.In May of this year, Iran exported 2.7 million barrels of oil per day, which accounted for nearly 3% of the world’s daily crude oil consumption. The new sanctions are expected to impact about 1.5 million BPD of Iran’s exports.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Under pressure from the U.S., many countries have begun to reduce oil exports from Iran. As the market has slowly absorbed the implications of this loss, crude oil prices have steadily risen. As recently as August, a barrel of Brent crude oil was still in the upper $60s. Today, the price has risen to $83/bbl — a four-year high. West Texas Intermediate is now over $73/bbl.This was entirely predictable. The world simply does not currently have a lot of spare crude oil capacity. But there is a widespread belief that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has excess capacity that can be used to offset the loss of Iranian oil.In fact, President Trump has tweeted his ire at OPEC on several occasions, most recently on September 20th when he wrote:We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!  Related: What Drove Brent Above $85?Saudi Arabia claims about 1.5 million BPD of spare capacity but that would take their production to an all-time high. A number of people have asked if I believe their claim. Yes, I think they do have some excess capacity, but the bulk of that is reserved for true emergencies. High oil prices do not constitute an emergency.A true emergency would be the outbreak of violence in a major oil-producing country that took millions of barrels offline. In other words, a sudden, unexpected event that rocks that oil markets.Publicly, Saudi Arabia and Russia rebuffed President Trump’s request.  Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih stated “The markets are adequately supplied. I don’t know of any refiner in the world who is looking for oil and is not able to get it.”Privately, Saudi Arabia is expected to increase production somewhat to offset Iran’s lost barrels. It won’t be enough to make up for all of Iran’s lost exports, and it will put the world in a more precarious situation in case of a real emergency. But it may be enough to stave off a quick return to $100/bbl, as some analysts are predicting.By Robert RapierMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-The-Threat-Of-High-Oil-Prices-Overstated.html,"Oct 04, 2018 at 12:40 | Robert Rapier","Oct 04, 2018",Is The Threat Of High Oil Prices Overstated?
2018-10-04,"Rising oil prices are hurting consumers, Fatih Birol, the Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), says, calling on major all producers to do the best they can to further boost production and ease persistent supply concerns that pushed Brent Crude to above $86 a barrel on Wednesday.“Some countries have been making efforts to increase production but this is far from comforting the markets right now,” Birol told the Financial Times on Thursday, adding that his “hope is that all the producers are aware of the sensitive situation and make their best efforts.”Although higher energy prices may look like a boon for oil exporting countries today, tomorrow the economies of oil exporters will also suffer because of the lower demand growth stemming from high oil prices, Birol told FT.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();In an interview with Reuters, also today, Birol said that:“It is now high time for all the players, especially those key producers and oil exporters, to consider the situation and take the right steps to comfort the market, otherwise I don’t see anybody benefiting.”Earlier this week, the IEA chief also took to Twitter to comment on the oil price rally in recent weeks and its implications on global economy.“Rising oil prices are hurting consumers & economic growth prospects today – globally but particularly in the emerging economies – but in a rapidly changing energy world could also have implications for producers tomorrow,” Birol tweeted on Tuesday.  Related: A New Era Of LNG MegaprojectsU.S. President Donald Trump has also used Twitter several times this year to slam OPEC for keeping oil prices too high.Birol’s comments on oil prices and what oil producers should do come just after Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said earlier this week that Saudi Arabia would be pumping 10.7 million bpd in October—just below the Kingdom’s highest-ever production level—and would slightly raise production volumes in November.Russia, the leader of the non-OPEC nations part of the pact with OPEC, increased its oil production in September by 150,000 bpd from August, lifting output to a post-Soviet record high of 11.36 million bpd.Russia and Saudi Arabia are also said to be in a secret pact to quietly raise production between September and December, keeping the United States in the loop about that plan.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/IEA-Asks-Majors-Oil-Producers-To-Boost-Production.html,"Oct 04, 2018 at 12:23 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Oct 04, 2018",IEA Asks Majors Oil Producers To Boost Production
2018-10-04,"Saudi Arabia will spend US$20 billion on boosting its oil production capacity in the coming years, Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said, as quoted by Reuters. Earlier this week, the Kingdom’s top oil man said, during the Russia Energy Forum in Moscow, that the country was pumping 10.7 million bpd, with current production capacity standing at 12 million bpd, as per the Reuters report.These numbers mean that OPEC’s biggest producer and exporter has spare capacity of 1.3 million bpd, based on the self-reported September production figure, which might add anxiety to an already distressed market that has recently begun to question Saudi Arabia’s ability to boost oil production enough to offset the drop in supply widely expected after the entry into effect of U.S. sanctions against Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer.The investment pledge will do little to assuage the worry: optimists believed Saudi Arabia has the capacity ready and waiting to be deployed within months, although skeptics warned boosting production from the current level would take a lot longer than just a few months. Still, with August production at 10.42 million bpd, if the September figure is confirmed by external sources, it would mean a pretty quick ramp-up of almost 300,000 bpd.However, according to the monthly Reuters survey of OPEC supply, Saudi Arabia pumped 10.53 million bpd in September, up by just 50,000 bpd from August, when Reuters estimated it had produced an average 10.48 million bpd. OPEC’s secondary sources put Saudi Arabia’s oil production in August at 10.4 million bpd. OPEC will release the September production figures next week.Also in Moscow, Al-Falih said the Kingdom will continue pumping more this month and in November, in line with earlier statements made in a bid to calm down an increasingly distressed market. The current oil production rate of the Kingdom is the highest on record after the 10.72 million bpd reported for November 2016, two months before the OPEC+ production cut agreement went into force.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Saudi-Arabia-To-Splash-20B-On-Oil-Capacity-Boost.html,"Oct 04, 2018 at 10:31 | Irina Slav","Oct 04, 2018",Saudi Arabia To Splash $20B On Oil Capacity Boost
2018-10-04,"The U.S. State Department has lashed out against OPEC, accusing the cartel of hiding 1.42 million bpd in spare oil production capacity, S&P Global Platts reports, citing a statement sent to it by the State Department.The State Department said figures from the Energy Information Administration suggested that OPEC was withholding 1.42 million bpd of spare capacity and the department was working with the cartel to “produce the spare capacity,” as S&P Global Platts put it.The way this “hidden” number of barrels was calculated was not revealed. In its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook, the EIA estimated OPEC’s spare production capacity at 1.66 million bpd. Most of this must be Saudi Arabia’s spare capacity, and one cannot forget that the spare capacity of Venezuela is questionable, as is the spare capacity of other troubled oil producers such as Libya and Iran.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();To make matters more confusing still, the International Energy Agency last month estimated OPEC’s spare capacity at 2.7 million bpd and is fast declining. Bloomberg quoted a warning from the international agency that the producers who had promised to offset any loss of supply from Iran would not be able to deliver on this promise.The State Department spokesperson also told S&P Global Platts that Russia and Saudi Arabia were withholding production while the United States was ramping up, with the national total seen to rise by 1 million bpd within 12 months.Interestingly, the accusations against OPEC come on the heels of a revelation that Russia and Saudi Arabia had agreed privately to increase production to offset any supply declines pushing prices higher. Reuters reported yesterday, citing an unnamed source, that “The Russians and the Saudis agreed to add barrels to the market quietly with a view not to look like they are acting on Trump’s order to pump more.”By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/OPEC-Accused-Of-Hiding-Spare-Capacity.html,"Oct 04, 2018 at 09:29 | Irina Slav","Oct 04, 2018",OPEC Accused Of Hiding Spare Capacity
