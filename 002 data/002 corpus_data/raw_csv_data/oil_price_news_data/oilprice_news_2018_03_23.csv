2018-03-23,"President Trump fired his National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster on Thursday and replaced him with a staunch proponent of war. The appointment significantly raises the odds of a clash with Iran and North Korea, and almost certainly will result in the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Iran deal.John Bolton was a fierce supporter of the 2003 war in Iraq, and comes to the White House as an unreconstructed proponent of the invasion. In fact, one would be hard pressed to name a proposed war that he has not supported. In the past, he has repeatedly advocated for military conflict in both North Korea and Iran, preemptively, and that remains the case today.Recently, the U.S. has been negotiating with European officials over how to amend the Iran nuclear deal to appease Donald Trump. Germany, the UK and France have entertained stepping up some measures –related to Iran’s ballistic missiles program, the end date of the limits on the nuclear program and the authority of international nuclear inspectors – with an eye on keeping the U.S. in the agreement.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();The WSJ reports that the U.S. wants the deal extended in perpetuity, but Europe says that would amount to a renegotiation of the entire deal. The sticking point leaves plenty of room for the hardline U.S. government to find a pretext to withdraw from the deal. That was the case before John Bolton’s appointment. With John Bolton now chirping in Trump’s ear, few expect the Iran deal to survive in Washington.Last year, Bolton released a blueprint on how the U.S. could and should get out of the deal, a deal that he called “a threat to U.S. national-security interests.” In the plan, he says “unilateral U.S. sanctions should be imposed,” and he also said “we will discuss military options.” He explicitly says the U.S. should provide assistance to a variety of opposition groups in Iran, stopping just short of a full-throated endorsement of regime change, although that was clearly implied.Related: The Oil Major That Won’t Leave IranNeedless to say, Bolton’s appointment as National Security Advisor likely means the end of U.S. involvement in the Iran nuclear deal. The deadline to extend a waiver on sanctions is May 12.""Bolton is an unrepentant advocate of regime change against Iran and his demands for the May 12 ultimatum -- in a practical sense -- will be sharper than those of McMaster,"" Richard Nephew, a principal deputy coordinator for sanctions policy at the State Department during the Obama administration, told S&P Global Platts. Nephew authored a recent report that estimated that Iran could lose 400,000 to 500,000 bpd if U.S. sanctions were re-imposed on Iran.Trump seemed to telegraph his intentions on Tuesday. ""A lot of bad things are happening in Iran,"" Trump said on March 20 just before meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. ""The [Iran nuclear] deal is coming up in one month and you will see what happens.""Ultimately, at this point, U.S. sanctions on Iran are likely, and in a worst-case scenario the U.S. could begin exploring military options against Iran. To say the least, the risk of war is much higher after Bolton’s appointment.Meanwhile, a similar scenario is possible for North Korea. Bolton wrote an op-ed in February titled “The Legal Case for Striking North Korea First,” and last year he said on Fox News ""I think the only diplomatic option left is to end the regime in North Korea by effectively having the South take it over."" President Trump’s much-hyped sit-down with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un may not happen, and the odds of a military strike are now much higher.Related: Oil Markets Should Fear A Demand ShortageIf Trump meets Kim Jong-un, it should “be a fairly brief session where Trump says: ‘Tell me you have begun total denuclearization, because we’re not going to have protracted negotiations. You can tell me right now or we’ll start thinking of something else,’” Bolton said earlier this month. That “something else” was clearly a reference to a preemptive military strike against North Korea.The U.S.-North Korea summit is supposed to take place in May, the same month that the U.S. could scrap the Iran nuclear deal and re-impose sanctions. May is shaping up to a fateful month for U.S. foreign policy.The fallout could have wide ramifications for the oil market – a lot of oil supply could be put at risk this year after the dramatic reshuffling of the U.S. government over the past two weeks, which has created  “the most radically aggressive foreign policy team around the American president in modern memory,” according to the New York Times.Moreover, it could occur at a time when the oil market is getting tighter anyway, raising the odds of much higher prices. ""We are only 3-4 weeks away from peak refinery maintenance, after which crude and product demand should accelerate ... Global inventories are already at the bottom end of the five-year range. With the inventory cushion largely gone, oil prices will likely be more sensitive to geopolitical risk factors,"" Morgan Stanley said in a research note. ""There are sufficient reasons to expect oil prices to strengthen further from here, and we stick with our (Brent) $75 per barrel call for Q3,"" Morgan Stanley said.That could be a conservative estimate if Bolton succeeds in pushing the Trump administration in a much more hawkish direction, as seems likely.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/What-Trumps-New-Appointment-Means-For-Oil-Prices.html,"Mar 23, 2018 at 17:53 | Nick Cunningham","Mar 23, 2018",What Trump's New Appointment Means For Oil Prices
2018-03-23,"A group of more than 100 GOP Senators and House Representatives has called on President Trump to keep investor protection provisions in NAFTA intact. Otherwise, the group says, U.S. investments in Mexico’s oil and gas industry would come under threat.The legislators detailed their concerns in a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, cited by S&P Platts. They urged the President to keep these provisions intact to reassure U.S. companies investing south of the border that their investments are safe, and should an issue arise between a U.S. company operating in Mexico and the government, there will be a mechanism in place allowing the company to seek international arbitration to settle the issue.The importance of these investor protection provisions seems to be more prominent now than before as the frontrunner for the Mexican elections this summer is leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador from the Morena party, who has more than once said that he will review all oil contracts inked by the Pena Nieto government with foreign oil companies.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();These oil contracts are part of the foray of U.S. energy companies into Mexico following a wide energy sector reform enacted in 2013. As a result of the reform, after an initially slow start to attracting foreign investment, Mexico’s offshore oil auctions have recently started paying off, after an alliance (including foreign firms) announced a “world class discovery” estimated to hold more than 1 billion barrels of oil in place—one of the major global discoveries in the past five years.Related: The Oil Major That Won’t Leave IranIn addition, supermajors Exxon, Chevron, and BP are opening or plan to open their first service stations to tap into the Mexican refined products market. Shell is the latest Big Oil player to enter the retail market, pledging US$1 billion in investment over the next 10 years.S&P Platts’ Meghan Gordon notes that the investor protections under NAFTA have been instrumental in this influx of U.S. and transnational energy company investments in Mexico, so removing them could jeopardize these and future investments, especially in light of Obrador’s suggestions he would try to undo the energy reform.Of course, whether he would really attempt such a move is unclear, not simply because he may face constitutional restrictions in his actions regarding the reform, but also because Mexico needs higher oil and gas production and Pemex is in no position to go it alone in achieving this goal.And it is not just the most likely next Mexican president that is making legislators nervous. Some are concerned that Mexico and Canada have already started negotiating their separate, bilateral, investor protection mechanisms. “I'm deeply concerned about reports that Mexico and Canada have begun negotiating bilateral ISDS provisions without us, because USTR said it doesn't want to participate in that,"" the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Kevin Brady, said during a committee hearing of Lighthizer.Related: Oil Markets Should Fear A Demand ShortageThe U.S. Trade Representative countered the concern of the congressmen noting that there are other ways to ensure an investment abroad, such as adding special clauses to that effect in their contracts with the foreign government and state-to-state dispute settlement channels. These, Lighthizer said, were used effectively before NAFTA and its investor protection provisions came into force.If Lighthizer’s stance is any indication, Washington is unhappy with the investor protection mechanism of NAFTA. However, as committee chairman Brady pointed out, American businesses want to know who has their back when they invest abroad, which for the legislators seems to be the crux of the matter.Yet NAFTA protects investors from all three signatory countries, not just U.S. ones, which seems to be Lighthizer’s concern and the government’s. The investor protection debate seems to be the latest sign that the renegotiation talks will continue to drag as they have dragged so far.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Oil-Interests-In-Jeopardy-If-Key-NAFTA-Provision-Is-Removed.html,"Mar 23, 2018 at 17:52 | Irina Slav","Mar 23, 2018",U.S. Oil Interests In Jeopardy If Key NAFTA Provision Is Removed
2018-03-23,"2017 was the highest producing year for oil in the GoM and included the record month in March. Gas, which has tended to come from shallow water wells, had accelerated decline. The production would have been higher but for some disruptions from Hurricanes, in particular Nate, though that had the least impact onshore, and some unplanned outages in November and December due to equipment failures. The failure to Delta House subsea manifold affected Rigel, Otis and Son of Bluto 2 fields, and the first two still appear to be off-line while Son of Bluto 2 resumed production in December (LLOG, the operator, I think calls the Rigel field Neidermeyer, which is much better for the Animal House theme). The Enchilada gas pipeline appears to have ruptured at the main platform and has resulted in Baldpate, Salsa, Llano, Cardamom and Magnolia going off-line. Plans were recently announced to restart Baldpate/Salsa, which do not go through the platform, but I haven’t seen any notice of the restart.(Click to enlarge)googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();C&C ProductionDecember production numbers were dominated by the unplanned outages, so comparisons with November don’t mean much. As well as the two issues given above the Tahiti and Caesar/Tonga fields were off line for a few weeks, though I have seen no news why (these share a common set of leases but are produced separately to the Tahiti and Constitution platforms). Each month that these are three issues hold current outages would knock about 10 to 12 kbpd off the achievable average production for 2018.(Click to enlarge)Despite recent variability it certainly looks like the new fields brought on since late 2013, and which have seen all the net growth since then, have peaked. Any average decline rate can’t really be extrapolated yet, given the recent upsets, but the BOEM reserve estimate updates, due in the next couple of months, will provide better R/P numbers as there will be longer operating data for all the fields. (Click to enlarge)BP, Shell, Anadarko, Chevron and BHP have completed a lot of brownfield work and in-fill drilling to maintain production at their large, operated platforms, but they may be running out of options for the next couple of years, and there is some evidence of rising water cut in some of the larger leases at Shenzi, Atlantis and Thunder Horse (and also in West Boreas, a recent start-up for Shell in Mars-Ursa).(Click to enlarge)Natural Gas ProductionNatural gas production saw accelerated decline through 2017, mostly from rapid decline of Hadrian South and the Enchilada outage. Shallow fields added some production late in the year, all from one lease in the Eugene Island area.(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)Apart from Hadrian South most of the gas from new fields is associated with the oil production and will decline in line with that. Otis is a small gas field that has been held offline by the Delta House outage.(Click to enlarge)The impact from the loss of Baldpate / Salsa production, which are mostly gas producers, is shown here, however also evident is how fast those fields had been declining anyway since 2014.Hadrian SouthHadrian South looks to have finished. Production had been dropping fast since the summer and then, in October and November, water production appeared, and gas flow stopped. On plateau it produced 300 mmscfd from only two wells, which is pretty prolific and slightly higher than planned. The wells had been producing about equally, but one died between May and July and the second in November. Both were offline throughout December.Related: What Trump’s Tariffs Mean For Global Oil And GasOverall the field’s total recovery is lower than the BOEM reserve estimate, but only by about 38 bcf (6.5 mmbbls) so it’s questionable whether there will be any further efforts at increased recovery, certainly in the near future as there is no drilling rig contracted there, although there is another qualified lease for the field that has not yet been produced.(Click to enlarge)Production Wells Creaming Curves The following two charts show the number of producing wells for new fields and the larger, mature platforms. They both show how wells were added from 2014 through 2016, leading to the increased production in these two groups, but both numbers have now flattened off, which is likely to precede the start of a decline. For the new additions the move to tie-backs with one or two wells in 2016 and 2017 is evident and the continuous development at Mars-Ursa also stands out.(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)Drilling ActivityBy Baker-Hughes active drill rigs averaged 20 in 2017 compared to almost 23 in 2016, and the numbers have continued to drop this year with a low of 13 earlier in March (the lowest since 2000, though the drop in shallow gas drilling is responsible for, by far, most of the change).(Click to enlarge)BOEM gives a monthly break down of each well by category, and it is noticeable how the number of wells being drilled has fallen off in the second half of 2017. (I think inactive wells are those that have not yet seen any production, but sometimes these are counted as “temporarily abandoned”, of which there are many and therefore it’s impossible to pick out new ones from old.)(Click to enlarge)2018 plansThe Stampede platform started up in January. It has nameplate of 80 kbpd but some of that is for potential future tie-backs. The wells are pre-drilled, and it should reach 50 or 60 kbpd stream day production quickly, though maybe not with high availability initially.Related: Oil Prices Tear Higher On Middle East TensionsLLOG plan to bring several fields on line with one to three well tie-backs to existing platforms. However Red Zinger and La Femme / Blue Wing Olive go to Delta House. The subsea system is likely to be fixed when these are due, but the Platform was operating at nameplate capacity and with extended production deferral may not have processing capacity for these new wells this year.Anadarko has planned five wells in existing fields, in particular for Constellation with BP, which will be about 15 kbpd. Anadarko have stated that they are looking at redeploying spar platforms onto other fields (probably for Shenandoah). I think that means one or more of their developments are nearing end of life, despite recent near field tie-backs, and that their remaining green field prospects are not very attractive at current oil prices. The platform mentioned was Marlin, though they have other mature Spar facilities like Holstein, which may impact LLOG as their tie-backs for Crown & Anchor are due to go there (but may have relatively short lives) and also is the site for two of this year’s new wells so maybe this is just conceptual speculation at the moment.Big Foot is due at the end of the year. It was originally planned for 2015 start-up but had mechanical failures during installation, which are now fixed. Capacity is 75 kbpd nameplate. It is heavy oil and uses dry trees with ESPs. Two wells are pre-drilled, but the rest only have the top two conductor sections ready, therefore ramp-up will be through 2019 as new wells get completed.By Peak Oil BarrelMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Can-The-Gulf-Of-Mexico-Break-Its-Oil-Production-Record.html,"Mar 23, 2018 at 17:52 | Ron Patterson","Mar 23, 2018",Can The Gulf Of Mexico Break Its Oil Production Record?
