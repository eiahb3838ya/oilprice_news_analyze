2019-01-29,"The Trump administration stepped up its effort at regime change in Venezuela on Monday, announcing sanctions intended to cripple the country’s oil sector.The U.S. government will bar most transactions between any American companies and PDVSA, with some limited exceptions. The U.S. Treasury Department justified the sanctions, saying that PDVSA has “long been a vehicle for embezzlement.” The sanctions immediately put 500,000 bpd of Venezuelan oil exports at risk, as well as some 100,000 bpd of U.S. exports of diluents to Venezuela.Citgo, the U.S.-based subsidiary of Venezuela, would be allowed to continue to operate, but its revenues will be diverted into a designated account. The Trump administration is trying to put Venezuela’s oil revenues into the hands of its preferred president, Juan Guiadó.The threat of oil sanctions on Venezuela has been on the table for the better part of two years. Former U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson repeatedly hinted at the possibility of oil sanctions, but the U.S. government held off on such a drastic move over fears that it would deepen the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela and it would also result in the U.S. bearing responsibility for the crisis.Both of those things are now happening. Prior American sanctions have arguably made the humanitarian situation much worse, and the new round will surely deepen the misery inside the country.Moreover, the U.S. is actively seeking regime change in Venezuela and is no longer trying to hide that fact. If there was any question about American intentions, those were put to rest late last week with the appointment of Elliott Abrams as the special envoy for American policy on Venezuela.  Related: What’s Behind Saudi Arabia’s New Downstream Strategy?Abrams is infamous for his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair, his support for strongmen in Central America that engaged in massacres in the 1980s, as well as his efforts to discredit reports of those killings. In many ways, he personifies the very dark period of American foreign policy in Latin America in the 20th century. His elevation to lead American policy on Venezuela is a little on the nose, but to be sure, the Trump administration no longer has any compunction about broadcasting its desire for regime change.Trump’s National Security Advisor, John Bolton, was holding a yellow legal pad at a press conference, which had “5,000 troops to Colombia” scribbled on it. He did not mention that fact, and the White House declined to backtrack when asked about it, a spokesman responded by saying “as the President has said, all options are on the table.”In the meantime, the sanctions on PDVSA alone are a dramatic escalation in the campaign to oust Maduro, and they amount to a “nuclear bomb,” Franscico Monaldi of the Baker Institute at Rice University said in comments to the New York Times. However, he pointed out that Chevron, Halliburton and Schlumberger are going to be allowed to continue to work in Venezuela. That suggests that Venezuela’s oil production may not entirely collapse.The motivation by the U.S. government is to rip Venezuela’s oil sector out of Maduro’s hands and place it under the control of Juan Guiadó. As such, the U.S. wants Venezuela’s oil sector to remain alive, if on life support.  Related: Trump Looks To Neutralize Pipeline OpponentsBut the sanctions seriously complicate the situation. Venezuela has been exporting upwards of 500,000 bpd to American refiners on the Gulf Coast. Any shipments already at sea will be allowed to reach their destination, but sales will be barred going forward. PDVSA can seek alternative destinations for its crude, such as in India and China, but it is going to have to offer some painful discounts to complete sales in those markets.However, if the sanctions starve the Venezuelan government of hard currency, Maduro and PDVSA may struggle to meet it soaring debt obligations. That could put Citgo in the sights of swarming creditors, something that Maduro clearly sees as a possibility. “With this measure they’re setting out to steal the Citgo company from all Venezuelans,” Maduro said at the diplomatic ceremony in Caracas. “No, Donald Trump. No, no, no.” The U.S. estimates that the sanctions could cost the Maduro government around $11 billion in missed revenue over the next year, and the new measures also freeze around $7 billion in assets.As for the global oil market, Venezuela is now in danger of suffering steeper supply losses, something that U.S. Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin dismissed as a minor problem. “There has been excess oil,” Mnuchin said, according to the NYT. “Many of our friends in the Middle East will be happy to make up the supply.”By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Seeks-To-Cripple-Venezuelas-No1-Vehicle-For-Embezzlement.html,"Jan 29, 2019 at 17:48 | Nick Cunningham","Jan 29, 2019",U.S. Seeks To Cripple Venezuela’s No.1 “Vehicle For Embezzlement’’
2019-01-29,"Digital technology adoption in all stages of upstream operations in the oil and gas industry has seen a steep rise recently. While a lot has been written about the benefits of digitizing various aspects of the well-drilling, extraction, and field maintenance processes, there is also another major field where digital tech is changing the game: before the well-drilling even begins.In Alaska, for instance, new technology in oil and gas exploration has led to the discovery of more than 1.5 billion barrels of crude oil in the North Slope in just two years, S&P Global Platts recently reported. These are deposits that were known to be there but the resources they held could not be mapped or measured, so the deposits were considered unproductive before digital tech, in the form of advanced 3D seismic surveys and new data processing techniques, came along.So, established exploration methods are one area where there is a surge of improvements, as seen in the Alaska case, but there are also alternative exploration techniques emerging around the world. One of these is, interestingly enough, soil analysis. A Dutch company, Biodentify, collects thousands of soil samples to analyze the DNA of thousands of microorganisms for traces of hydrocarbons in their environment. The company utilizes machine learning for the task and to calculate the potential reserves of a deposit with, according to the company, more than 70 percent accuracy. What’s more, the whole procedure takes between 6 and 10 weeks, which is a relatively short time, especially in light of the fact that it reduces the risk of drilling unproductive wells.As digital technology matures and machine learning techniques advance, we’ll probably be seeing a lot more different exploration techniques that reduce the risk of spending millions on a well only to find out it’s dry. Despite last year’s international oil price improvements, the industry is still being cautious and there are indications it is beginning to like this new normal of leaner and meaner, to a significant extent enabled by technology.  Related: Oil Prices See Best January In 14 YearsOil and gas companies, even the most resilient and successful among them, are keeping their spending under control. True, some supermajors have announced larger budgets for this year than last but for the most part, the industry is keeping a lid on expenses and trying to get more from every dollar spent than before.This is an environment conducive to a lot of innovation in all stages of the production process. New drilling tech is also helping lower costs and improve results. S&P Global Platts’ Tim Bradner notes coiled tubing drilling as an alternative to the multilaterals in horizontal drilling. Coiled tubing involves drilling horizontal wells with a flexible tubing bit, which is cheaper than drilling with rotary rigs. It could be so cheap, in fact, that drilling costs per barrel of new oil in already producing fields could be as little as US$30.Shell, on the other hand, is focusing on developing artificial intelligence to use in drilling, among other things. Business and tech expert Bernard Marr wrote recently in a story about his work on data strategy with the supermajor that Shell is using reinforcement learning, a form of machine learning, to improve drilling results and also reduce wear and tear on the equipment, which ultimately, once again, saves costs. The list of examples can continue and it will only become longer in the future. The oil and gas industry has been remarkably fast in adopting what digital technology has to offer and spurring innovation aimed specifically at the industry.Editors' Note: Biodentify has not played a role in the above mentioned exploration process that led to the discovery in Alaska's North Slope.

2019-01-29,"Libya’s largest oil field, Sharara, will not reopen until the armed group that has been occupying it for nearly two months backs down and leaves, the chairman of the National Oil Corporation (NOC), Mustafa Sanalla, said on Tuesday.The Sharara oil field, with capacity to pump 340,000 bpd, was shut down in early December and has been under force majeure since then, after armed militia claiming attachment to the local Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) seized control and demanded ransom to re-open it.More than a month later, Sharara remains offline, and NOC which refuses to yield to ransom demands, said as early as last month that “Oil production will now only restart at Sharara after alternative security arrangements are put in place.”  Sharara’s shutdown will result in daily production losses of 315,000 bpd, plus a loss of 73,000 bpd at the El Feel oil field because it depends on Sharara for electricity supply, NOC said in December, noting that the “combined daily cost to the Libyan economy of this unnecessary shutdown” is US$32.5 million.  Earlier this month, forces loyal to eastern strongman General Khalifa Haftar and his self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) said that they had started a military operation to secure oil sites and facilities in Libya’s south, where Sharara is located.  Referring to Sharara, NOC’s Sanalla said in London on Tuesday that “The armed group attempting to hold NOC, and Libya’s economic recovery to ransom, must leave the field before NOC will consider restarting production.”Related: Political Crisis In Venezuela To Reshape OPECCommenting on the military campaign in Libya’s south, Sanalla said at a Chatham House conference, as quoted by Reuters:“It is my concern that a sequence of events has been set in motion with unknowable consequences for Libya, and NOC.”Expressing concern about the developments in southern Libya and Sharara, Sanalla said earlier this month: “The restoration of security at NOC facilities is paramount to avoid further sabotage and theft of equipment ... Oil facilities must remain out of the purview of military operations and not used for political or economic leverage.”   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Why-Libyas-Largest-Oil-Field-Remains-Shut-Down.html,"Jan 29, 2019 at 12:25 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Jan 29, 2019",Why Libya’s Largest Oil Field Remains Shut Down
