2018-04-27,"India is one of the world’s largest oil consumers, accounting for around 4 percent of global consumption. Only the U.S. and China outrank India in this regard, making it a key player in the oil market.While India’s oil consumption has seen remarkable growth in the past few years, the recent rise in oil prices may soon force the nation to scale back its reliance on oil importation. In this new oil price environment, continued import growth would put a significant strain on the country’s economy.India’s Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has largely benefitted from the slump in oil prices over the last three years, exploiting the low prices by levying a heavy tax on this key commodity. Before Modi came into office, Brent crude averaged $99.43 a barrel. In his very first year, that figure fell by 42 percent before hitting historic lows the following year when WTI dropped below $27.As the economy has benefited from high taxation on petroleum and diesel, India has experienced a retail energy price significantly higher than that of its South Asian neighbors – with taxes accounting for half of the total retail cost of fuels in India.As the price of oil fell, the Indian government increased the excise duty on gasoline nine times over the course of three years. The failure of the government to pass these savings on to the consumer resulted in the alienation of the poorer classes of Indian society.At present, there is a $10.2 billion difference between the market and retail price of oil in India. This gap has led to India having one of the largest state supported societies in the world, with only Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela and China spending more on state support.A False EconomyWhen oil prices were low in India, the government saw earnings soar as it introduced heavy taxation on oil. However, rather than preparing for the inevitable fluctuation in oil prices the government spent the earnings on its bloated state support system.Related: What Is A ‘Fair’ Price For Oil?And now the chickens are coming home to roost. As oil prices have increased, Modi has been forced to plea with the top three Indian oil marketing companies, Indian Oil Corp., Bharat Petroleum Corp., and Hindustan Petroleum Corp., to sell product at a loss so that the state can keep oil prices stable. This short-term solution is far from sustainable.As the next election looms, India is facing a plethora of problems – one notable example is the lack of funding in the public transport system. Furthermore, after the Indian government failed to pass on oil price savings to the population, the working class has been largely alienated. The lack of investment and the disproportionate wealth distribution in the country is leading to public skepticism over Modi’s policies.  Lobbying groups are constantly increasing pressure on the Indian government to invest some of its tax earnings from petroleum and diesel into the overcrowded public transport systems in some of India’s larger cities. The metro systems of Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Bengaluru provide the best transport network for locals to avoid both congestion and pollution. Yet, they are gravely underfunded.Tackling the Addiction So, what’s the best way for India to battle this addiction?One obvious option that Modi will likely consider is to revisit an opportunity from a 2005 proposal. The Prime Minister could invite China to join forces with India in a bid to lower oil prices. With China and India together accounting for 17 percent of world oil consumption, these market giants could establish a bilateral agreement that would give the two nations the necessary clout to reduce the cost of oil from OPEC exporters.Related: Russia Bets Big On Arctic OilAnother, more sustainable, option is to stop relying so heavily on fossil fuels and shift finances toward the development of renewable energies. India is already a significant developer of new technologies, with high hopes of manufacturing a large fleet of electric cars in the coming years. But with failing initiatives, such as the trial of India’s electric car service Ola, there are growing trepidations over Modi’s promise to make all new vehicles electric by 2030.There were high hopes for expanding India’s renewables from the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015, with India promising to tackle its dependence on fossil fuels and its negative impact on climate change by installing 175 gigawatt (GW) of renewables power capacity over the next 7 years. However, targets have been repeatedly missed for solar, wind, hydro and bio power since 2016.If Modi wants to convince the public and international powers that he can maintain a stable economy and follow through with initiatives to produce and use renewable energies, his ongoing reliance on toil will have to stop.India’s pivot away from fossil fuels is fast becoming an economic necessity, and as long as oil prices remain high, India’s economy looks set to struggle.By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Can-India-Break-Its-Oil-Addiction.html,"Apr 27, 2018 at 17:02 | Felicity Bradstock","Apr 27, 2018",Can India Break Its Oil Addiction?
2018-04-27,"The latest round of open bidding for exploration rights in Mexico’s energy sector received mixed interest, with two further rights sales to take place later in the year.Of the 35 shallow offshore blocks on offer in the March 27 auction, 16 were sold, with the strongest interest seen in blocks in the Sureste Basin – in the south-eastern portion of the Gulf of Mexico – where all eight offerings found buyers.Mexico’s state-owned oil producer, Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex), won seven of the blocks on offer, one in its own right and six more in partnership with overseas energy firms.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Fourteen oil majors were pre-qualified to bid alongside 22 consortia. France’s Total was the biggest winner in the Sureste Basin, coming away with the largest share of three blocks coverin­­g a total of 2342 sq km. It received two of these as part of a consortium with Pemex, and one with BP and Pan American.The Ministry of Energy estimates that developing and operating the 16 blocks will require investment of $8.6 billion over the lifetime of the deposits.Related: How High Can Trump Push Oil Prices?Overall response to the auctions was slightly muted, with local and international majors showing some caution when making offers, partly due to the upcoming presidential election in July 2018, which has sparked concerns about potential changes to energy sector policy and rising supply in the market.Auctions for shale deposits set for SeptemberIndeed, the March auction was the first of up to three rights sales to be staged this year, with the remaining two land bids scheduled for late July and early September. The former will cover a total of 37 contractual areas in Burgos, Tampico-Misantla-Veracruz and the Sureste Basin.The September round of bidding will be particularly notable, as it will be the first time that development rights for shale deposits have been auctioned off in Mexico.Depleting natural gas reserves and high potential for shale – the country has 545trn cu feet of technically recoverable sources of shale gas, according to the World Resources Institute – have driven Mexico to accelerate development of the industry.Early last month the energy sector regulator, the National Hydrocarbons Commission (Comisión Nacional de Hidrocarburos, CNH), called for bids on nine blocks in the Burgos Basin – located in the state of Tamaulipas, in the north-west of the country – to be auctioned off in September.The blocks contain an estimated 1.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe), and winning bidders will have the right to conduct exploratory work for conventional oil and gas, as well as any shale deposits identified.Energy reform supports private sector developmentThe successive rounds of auctions for exploration and production rights are the keystone of Mexico’s energy reform policy. Launched in 2013, the reforms ended Pemex’s upstream and downstream monopoly, and offer the country the potential to generate $1trn of foreign direct investment by 2040, according to the Mexican Association of Hydrocarbons Companies.Related: Can Saudi Arabia Afford Its Megaprojects?Since 2014 there have been a series of series of licensing rounds, including the first auctions of deepwater blocks off the Mexican coast, opening up vast new reserves for the industry to tap.According to Rogelio Vélez, former CEO of Compañía Perforadora México – the infrastructure division of the mining and railway company Grupo México – domestic energy reforms have improved transparency in both the public and private sectors, which has made the investment climate more attractive.“So far in the upstream sector, the bidding processes have been largely transparent and, although newly created, the regulatory framework is comprehensive and forms a solid foundation for the rest of the reform,” Vélez told OBG.The effects of these changes are already being felt throughout the industry, and particularly in the upstream segment, according to Ivan Sandrea, CEO of independent upstream and midstream energy firm Sierra Oil and Gas.“In 2018 the private sector could be as active as Pemex in terms of exploration and drilling,” Sandrea told OBG in an interview late last year. “This shows how, in a relatively short period, energy reform has enabled the private sector to be as competitive as the national oil company.”Private sector activity accelerated last month, as operators moved into the exploration and production phases on some previously awarded blocks.BP announced plans to begin exploratory drilling on an offshore block it won the rights to develop in Mexico’s first deepwater oil bids in 2016, located in the Salina Basin in the southern region of the Gulf of Mexico.In late March CNH signed off on the plan presented by BP and its partners –Total and Norway’s Statoil – for a four-year exploration programme for the block. Initial drilling is scheduled to take place in the third quarter of 2020, with a total investment of $199.5m and up to 75m boe anticipated.By Oxford Business GroupMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Mexico-Opens-Last-Round-Of-Oil-Bidding-Before-Election.html,"Apr 27, 2018 at 17:02 | Oxford Business Group ","Apr 27, 2018",Mexico Opens Last Round Of Oil Bidding Before Election
2018-04-27,"Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, built on the back of the country’s oil wealth and the biggest in the world, reported its first quarterly loss in two years for January to March on the back of a global stock selloff that it had no means of avoiding as more than two-thirds of its holdings are in stocks.Commenting on the results, the chief executive of the fund, Yngve Slyngstad said, “The most important expression of risk in the fund is that the strategic equity share is set to 70 percent. This means that fluctuations in the fund’s value are predominantly determined by the development in global stock markets.”The Norway Government Pension Fund Global booked negative returns of 1.5 percent for the first quarter of the year, or a loss of US$15.1 billion (171 billion kroner). In stocks, the return was -2.2 percent, but in unlisted real estate investments there was a positive return of 2.5 percent. The real estate holdings of the fund, however, are just 2.7 percent, so that positive result had no bearing whatsoever on the overall performance of the fund. The rest of its holdings, at 31.2 percent, are in bonds.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Like other investment vehicles, the Norway fund suffered the effects from growing unease about protectionist policies in the United States combined with rising wages and expectations for more interest rate hikes. U.S. stocks comprise 36.1 percent of the fund’s stock portfolio and represent its single largest market. The largest equity holdings are in the tech sector, including Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet, as well as Nestle.Last month, the fund warned it could lose US$420 billion from its value—40 percent—this year if the market crashes and the Norwegian krone strengthens. “[Our estimate] is much larger than the numbers that have been discussed in Norway on the spending rule [that a government cannot use more than 3 per cent of the fund], and what would be the game plan in case the fund were reduced in krone rapidly,” Slyngstad told the FT at the time.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Norways-Sovereign-Wealth-Fund-Plunges-Into-Loss.html,"Apr 27, 2018 at 09:30 | Irina Slav","Apr 27, 2018",Norway’s Sovereign Wealth Fund Posts A Loss
