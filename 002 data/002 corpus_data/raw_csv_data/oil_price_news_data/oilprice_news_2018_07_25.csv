2018-07-25,"China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) will invest the equivalent of more than US$22 billion by 2020 on boosting its oil and gas production in the western region of Xinjiang to mitigate the impact of declining production from oil and gas fields in China’s northeast.CNPC said on Wednesday that it would invest more than US$22.1 billion (150 billion yuan) in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in the west to boost production in the region to more than 50 million tons of oil equivalent between 2018 and 2020.According to Reuters calculations, the investment that CNPC announced today would be equivalent to the total upstream investment made by CNPC’s listed unit and China’s largest oil and gas producer, PetroChina, in 2017.The investment in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region would serve several purposes, according to analysts. First, boosting production in the region would help offset declining production from the ageing fields in the Daqing oil province in the northeast. The investment would also serve to increase China’s domestic natural gas production as Beijing looks to switch from coal to the more environmentally friendly fuel. In addition, China would be looking to boost the economy, infrastructure, and natural gas access in the unruly autonomous region in its far west bordering Central Asia that has seen ethnic unrest in recent years.

Between January and June, crude oil production declined by 2 percent annually.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Chinas-CNPC-To-Invest-22-Billion-In-New-Oil-Frontier.html,"Jul 25, 2018 at 12:04 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Jul 25, 2018",China’s CNPC To Invest $22 Billion In New Oil Frontier
2018-07-25,"A day after the American Petroleum Institute pushed prices up by surprising the market with a draw across the crude oil and fuels inventory board, the Energy Information Administration reported a draw in crude oil and another draw in gasoline inventories for the week to July 20.Crude oil inventories were 6.1 million barrels lower in July 16-20 than in the week before, when the EIA reported a surprise build that made the price rally stutter. Inventory data has been mixed this year, with draws during refinery maintenance season and builds during driving season going counter to seasonal patterns.In gasoline, the EIA said, inventories last week shed 2.3 million barrels, with production averaging 10.3 million barrels daily slightly lower than last week’s average.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Distillate inventories were down by a modest 100,000 barrels, with production at 5.2 million bpd, virtually unchanged on the week.Refineries processed 17.3 million barrels daily last week, compared with 17.2 million bpd a week earlier.Oil prices have been on the mend this week as U.S.-Iran tensions and the API inventory draw offset earlier concern about global oversupply that had pushed WTI back below US$70 a barrel earlier this month.Yet the situation remains unstable. Despite the supply disruption potential in Iran, Libya, and Venezuela—where the IMF has predicted an inflation rate of a million percent—there are also bearish factors at play such as U.S. production, which last week hit the 11-million-bpd mark for the first time.

Emerging markets, which are at the heart of every upbeat global economy prediction, cannot maintain their pace of growth with costlier oil, so demand will probably ease until prices fall to a more palatable level.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Markets-Stabilize-On-Major-Crude-Draw.html,"Jul 25, 2018 at 09:43 | Irina Slav","Jul 25, 2018",Oil Markets Stabilize On Major Crude Draw
