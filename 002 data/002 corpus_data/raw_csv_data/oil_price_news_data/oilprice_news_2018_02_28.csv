2018-02-28,"Just a few years ago, hardly anyone expected that that the U.S. would be competing with the world’s top oil producers for the number 1 spot.Yet, thanks to the shale resurgence, here we are—over the past few weeks, American crude oil production outstripped that of Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s de facto leader and biggest exporter.Now the U.S. is on track to dethrone in the coming months the world’s current leader in oil production: Russia.Ironically, the second U.S. shale boom came in the wake of the OPEC/non-OPEC production cut deal masterminded and led by OPEC’s Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC’s Russia. As OPEC and its allies have been withholding a total of 1.8 million bpd production over the past year, oil prices have increased, thanks to the overhang drawdown on the back of restricted supply and stronger-than-expected global demand growth amid robust economic growth in basically all regions of the world.Except for the brief hiccup two weeks ago, WTI prices have held above $60 a barrel since the start of 2018. And shale production is booming and on course to crown America as the world’s top oil producer as early as later this year.The U.S. will become the world’s largest crude oil producer by 2019 at the latest, Fatih Birol, the Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), said this week. The U.S. will overtake Russia as the world’s largest oil producer “definitely next year”, if not as early as this year, he said.“The United States will become the No.1 oil producer sometime very soon,” Birol told Reuters, reiterating the IEA’s estimate from its latest monthly Oil Market Report published earlier in February.“US crude output, up 1.3 mb/d year-on-year (y-o-y), will soon overtake Saudi Arabia and could catch Russia by the end of the year,” the IEA said two weeks ago.“All the indicators that suggest continued fast growth in the US are in perfect alignment; rising prices leading, after a few months, to more drilling, more completions, more production, and more hedging,” the IEA said, warning that the surge in non-OPEC supply—led by the U.S.—could tip the oil market into deeper oversupply, again.Related: Should OPEC And U.S. Shale Collaborate For Survival?U.S. forecasts also suggest that the American oil production will beat both Saudi Arabia and Russia this year, assuming that the OPEC/non-OPEC deal remains intact until the end of 2018, as currently planned.The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects in its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook that U.S. production will average 10.6 million bpd this year. This is higher than Saudi Arabia’s current production of just below 10 million bpd.U.S. production will average 11.2 million bpd in 2019, the EIA said earlier this month. This is higher than Russia’s current production of just below 11 million bpd, as Moscow is cutting 300,000-bpd production as part of the OPEC-and-friends deal.So far in February 2018, U.S. crude oil production has topped 10 million bpd in each of the three previous weeks, EIA data shows.Not only is the U.S. boosting oil production, but it is also increasing its oil exports, including to the prized Asian market on which Saudi Arabia and Russia have been competing for market share. Higher U.S. oil exports—including to China and a historic first to the Middle East—are upending the global oil flows and eating away at the market shares of Saudi Arabia and Russia.Still, OPEC and its allies seem unfazed by U.S. shale and continue to send messages to the market that they will do “whatever it takes” to balance the oil inventories and that production cuts are here to stay until the end of 2018.OPEC’s most influential minister, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, said over the weekend that easing of the production cuts would start “sometime in 2019”.“But we don’t know when and we don’t know how,” al-Falih said, confirming that he wants a permanent ‘super group’ of OPEC and non-OPEC producers “in a market monitoring fashion that allows us to take quick decisions.”OPEC and its non-OPEC partners are set to review the deal in June and take stock of the pace of the market rebalancing. With soaring U.S. production threatening to undo a large part of their cuts, the cartel and allies may have to consider if the time has come for them to start defending their market share, or if they should stick to the cuts in the name of higher oil prices in order to get more oil revenues in budgets and boost the valuation of Saudi Aramco for the IPO currently planned for the second half of 2018.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Looks-To-Dethrone-Russia-As-Top-Oil-Producer.html,"Feb 28, 2018 at 17:40 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Feb 28, 2018",U.S. Looks To Dethrone Russia As Top Oil Producer
2018-02-28,"Oil and gas is a trillion dollar industry, and every actor within it, be it national oil companies, multinationals, independents or oilfield services companies, has a stake in oil and gas flourishing. And now these players face an existential question, how will the industry react to new challenges in the shape of electric vehicles and renewables?Not long ago, technological advancements led to the rise of U.S. shale. A significant increase in U.S. shale oil and shale gas production not only allowed the United States to reduce its oil import dependency but also influenced international oil prices. This may be good news from a consumer perspective, but it was detrimental for most major oil producers, particularly OPEC members.Oil prices have fallen significantly since mid-2014 because of a myriad of factors, including a significant increase in shale oil and gas production. First, OPEC believed it could challenge this emerging enemy by ramping up oil production in order to bankrupt shale drillers. However, to OPEC’s surprise, events did not materialize as quickly as anticipated. Eventually, after a lag of 5-8 months, there was a plunge in U.S. shale output. Nevertheless, the lower oil prices also severely affected the economies of major oil producing countries, which heavily rely on oil revenues; in some cases, oil contributes over 90 percent of their total export revenues. Thus, most of these countries were looking for higher average oil prices in order to meet their national budgets and to realize their respective long-term visions. A vision that requires huge consistent cash flows.Subsequently, OPEC turned to old practices, cutting oil production in an effort to revive oil prices. A strong compliance has led to a drop in OECD inventories from 264 million barrels a year ago to 52 million barrels in early 2018. Consequently, in last couple of months, oil prices have been fluctuating in mid-sixties.History has taught us that nothing lasts forever. We have seen the dominance of coal that was once responsible for industrial revolution; its role is diminishing not only due to the availability of new resources but also due to environmental and economic considerations. The increasing role of oil demand in transport sector was only possible due to perfection of the internal combustion engine that revolutionized the auto-industry in particular.The dominance of autoindustry for over a century allowed oil demand to thrive as the global transportation sector accounts for 65 percent of global oil demand (road, air, rail, sea). As such, oil demand has substantially increased over time and reached 96 million barrels per day (mmbpd) in 2017.  Related: Trump’s Gas Tax Hike Could Make Californian Fuel CheaperBased on the historical trend, population growth and economic outlook, most of the international agencies and consultants were of the view that oil demand would reach 121 mmbpd by 2040. However, as the automotive industry becomes more incentivized to build electric vehicles (EVs), this is unlikely.Surely, EVs won’t replace all ICEs overnight. That transformation would require over decades. Therefore, no one is claiming that oil demand in road transportation in particular will be wiped out suddenly. A speedy penetration of EVs, however, could lead to a significant slowdown in oil demand.  In 2016, I wrote a paper “Will OPEC Use This Strategy To Defeat U.S. Shale?”, the analysis concluded that the U.S. shale oil industry is insensitive to changes in oil prices in the short-term, but will strengthen in the longer term.When oil prices increase, shale oil production increases and generally recovers the lost share in production but also surpasses its earlier respective peaks. The analysis in the abovementioned article could provide some critical answers to OPEC, offering some clues on how the cartel could defend its market share. One strategy may be to flip flop oil production in order to navigate increases/decreases in oil prices (although this may run counter to their fundamental policy). For example, OPEC members could freeze oil production or even decrease production and allow oil prices to gradually increase between $50 to $78/bbl for 5 to 8 months (lag to respond by shale oil industry) and then increase their production (for 4 to 5 months) to lower oil prices back down to $50/bbl to dampen the revival of shale oil production. This “flip flop” strategy of production will allow OPEC to fetch an average of higher oil prices compared to their strategy of solely defending market share, while at the same time also keep the shale oil revival in check. In 2018, however, not even this ‘flip-flop’ policy will work due to the significant increase in drilled but uncompleted wells (DUC). For example, the number of DUC’s increased from 4128 in December 2013 to 7609 in January 2018. This gave the shale oil industry a greater flexibility to respond promptly when required.Strategy Wining Short-Term Goals - CollusionInstead of going it alone, OPEC may decide to collaborate with the U.S. shale oil industry. In this partnership, both parties have to agree to some degree as to how much to produce in order to achieve some reasonable annual average oil prices say between $70 to $80/bbl or even more. In theory, this partnership could work, but many independent oil producers might not see the need to comply.Yet another problem is how to determine production quotas, especially for U.S. shale oil producers. It is already difficult enough to control production quota among the few OPEC members. How can one expect oil majors and independent shale oil producers to adhere to certain output quota? If such a strategy could somehow be realized, but parties could be winning.Related: Trump’s Gas Tax Hike Could Make Californian Fuel CheaperNevertheless, this policy has its own negative implications. Higher oil prices may speed up the penetration of EVs as they will encourage the autoindustry find ways to bring the production costs of EVs down.Alternative Strategies – New Business StructureInstead of collusion, the industry should realize the facts and act accordingly. The senior executives of the major oil and gas companies know the fate of the oil industry very well, even though they avoid acknowledging it publically. The shrewd executives are already in the process of developing alternative strategies to remain in the business, maybe with a different structure. Eventually executives of NOCs should also realize that continued dependency on oil revenue alone could be self-defeating and may hold them back from their respective national visions. The oil industry has to develop alternative business models to diversify oil based economies sooner rather than later.     By Salman Ghouri for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Should-OPEC-And-US-Shale-Collaborate-For-Survival.html,"Feb 28, 2018 at 13:49 | Salman Ghouri","Feb 28, 2018",Should OPEC And U.S. Shale Collaborate For Survival?
2018-02-28,"Once unthinkable, in December 2015 the U.S. decided to lift the nation’s 40-year ban on crude oil exports driven by a boom in domestic shale, tight oil production. Until then, crude exports just went to exempted Canada. Now more than 24 months later, U.S. oil exports have continued to change the dynamics of the global oil market.The U.S. has been gaining market share thanks to the ongoing agreement between OPEC and key partners like Russia to cut production by 1.8 million b/d. The WTI-Brent spread peaked at $8 per barrel in September, when refinery shut-ins from Hurricane Harvey glutted the U.S. market and helped exports spike by the end of October. The spread has been falling since, but U.S. crude exporters are highly competitive when Brent has a $4 premium.Since 2008, U.S. crude oil production has more than doubled to 10.3 million b/d, record weekly output per EIA data. U.S. oil demand, meanwhile, has been flat in the 18.5 to 19.7 million b/d range for a decade, so the export opportunity has been allowed to open as output has grown.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();And the tight oil that has been the basis of the U.S. revolution is a lighter, less viscous type, with API gravity of 40 degrees and higher. Yet, the country’s huge 18.6 million b/d capacity refining system is generally configured to process heavier crudes from Canada, Mexico, and Venezuela. This mismatch helps explain why the U.S. has been exporting large volumes of crude but has also been importing it, taking in 7.9 million b/d so far this year.Additionally, heavier crude types can actually be more desirable because they are less expensive and thus refiners capture higher margins when producing products from these grades. It is also important that refineries operate all their units as close to capacity as possible to maximize returns and pay for the pricey equipment required. This has also allowed the U.S. export window to open.    Related: How Oil Trade Is Getting An Efficiency BoostChina, the world's 2nd largest oil consumer, has ramped up imports from the U.S. American crude shipments to China went from nothing prior to 2016 to a record 0.4 million b/d in January, worth $1 billion. As for the other most important incremental market, “since its crude oil is $2 per barrel cheaper than the imported Dubai crude, inclusion of U.S. for imports is a very good move for India,” notes CARE Ratings.Overall, however, oil products constitute about 75-85 percent of all U.S. oil exports. Neighbor Mexico has been taking in about 60 percent of U.S. gasoline. But presidential front-runner (election in July) Andrés Manuel López Obrador has made upgrading the country’s refinery system a top priority. Mexico’s refining capacity has stagnated at around 1.5 million b/d for a decade – despite the population rising by nearly 20 percent to over 130 million people.Looking forward, although U.S. exports to Mexico will remain high simply because of proximity, the main purpose of the country’s historic 2013 Energy Reforms was to produce more energy domestically, not to increase reliance on the U.S. Mexico extracting crude oil, sending it to the U.S. to be refined, and then importing those products is an obvious economic drain. As such, we can expect that an increasing number of countries will have the chance to shop for U.S. oil.(Click to enlarge)By Jude Clemente for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Endless-Opportunities-For-US-Oil-Exports.html,"Feb 28, 2018 at 11:45 | Jude Clemente","Feb 28, 2018",The Endless Opportunities For U.S. Oil Exports
2018-02-28,"A day after the American Petroleum Institute gave oil bulls a cold shower by reporting a 933,000-barrel build in crude oil inventories on top of a gasoline build, the Energy Information Administration deepened the gloom by reporting a 3-million-barrel build for the week to February 23.Analysts had expected the EIA to report a 1.2-million-barrel build in crude oil inventories, so the actual figure is likely to be felt as a slap in the face for many.Gasoline stockpiles were also up, by 2.5 million barrels. That compares with a 300,000-barrel build in the previous week. Production averaged 9.4 million bpd in the week to February 23, down from 10.1 million bpd a week earlier. Refineries operated at 87.8 percent of capacity, processing 15.9 million bpd of crude.Prices continue to be supersensitive for any piece of new information. They fell after API reported the build on Tuesday, although the fall was capped by upbeat remarks from Saudi Arabia regarding oil production. The Kingdom’s energy minister said this was going to be lower in the first quarter than it was supposed to be under the production cut agreement.Industrial data from Japan and China, however, weighed on oil benchmarks as they signaled there is a possibility that the string of economic outlooks forecasting stronger oil demand will never become reality.  Related: Trump’s Gas Tax Hike Could Make Californian Fuel CheaperAt the time of writing, West Texas Intermediate traded at US$63.07 a barrel and Brent was at US$66.43.China is a particularly big cause for worry. This week it reported the weakest industrial output growth data since mid-2016. Although last year China became the largest importer of crude oil, this year demand growth is expected to slow down as tougher pollution rules go into effect and as China continues its move away from heavy industry and towards services.Added to this is the continual growth in U.S. shale oil production. Last week, this hit 10.27 million bpd and the EIA has projected that the U.S. will become the world’s largest producer, overtaking Russia, by 2019 at the latest if production continues to grow at this fast pace.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Prices-Head-Lower-As-Crude-Gasoline-Inventories-Rise.html,"Feb 28, 2018 at 09:40 | Irina Slav","Feb 28, 2018","Oil Prices Head Lower As Crude, Gasoline Inventories Rise"
