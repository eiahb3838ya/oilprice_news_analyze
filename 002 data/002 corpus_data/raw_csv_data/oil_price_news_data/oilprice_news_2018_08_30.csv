2018-08-30,"Texas-based Vista Proppants and Logistics has struck a deal with logistics firm JupiterMLP to transload crude oil from truck to rail at Pecos, Texas, and ship crude on the Union Pacific Railroad through 2019 and potentially into 2020, to seize crude-by-rail opportunities for moving oil out of the Permian until pipeline capacity catches up with rising production.The Permian production exceeding pipeline takeaway capacity has depressed the prices of Midland, Texas, crude compared to the price of the grade at Houston, and shippers and producers are looking for other ways of moving the oil to the market.Currently Vista expects to ship around 400,000 barrels per month from Pecos to St James, Louisiana.“The amount of crude shipped out of Pecos could be larger than Vista’s current estimate, which is dependent on the number of available train slots each month. Union Pacific has indicated they will continually evaluate their mainline capacity and provide additional service as it becomes available,” Vista said.“The strategic location and capabilities of our Pecos facility make it a natural fit for crude-by-rail operations, and we look forward to assisting our customers with their transport needs as takeaway infrastructure for the Permian is further built out over the next couple of years,” Vista’s chief executive Gary Humphreys said.“The crude-by-rail opportunity that their facility provides helps us to accelerate our strategy of moving significant volumes of Permian Basin crude oil to the Gulf Coast while we construct our Jupiter Pipeline and VLCC loading terminal in Brownsville, Texas,” said Juniper CEO Tom Ramsey.

The current pipeline capacity in the Permian is 3.1 million bpd. Railway capacity, according to S&P Platts, is around 315,000 bpd, but railway is mostly used to supply frac sand.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/New-Crude-By-Rail-Service-Aims-To-Ease-Permian-Bottlenecks.html,"Aug 30, 2018 at 11:53 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Aug 30, 2018",New Crude-By-Rail Service Aims To Ease Permian Bottlenecks
2018-08-30,"The current pipeline constraints in the Permian have been caused by the booming production recorded since the crude oil price recovered in mid-2016. While production has burgeoned, the necessary pipeline infrastructure has been slow to catch-up. Midland to Cushing WTI spreads widened, and US crude output remained flat in May.The production slowdown was thought to be an indication that pipeline constraints were limiting growth in the Permian. The entire Lower 48 States grew only 46 kb/d in May, after seeing an average monthly growth of 179 kb/d in the previous three months.Despite the tightening pipeline capacity, the latest Kayrros data show that the production growth in June is actually hitting record highs. There was an overall increase of about 287 kb/d in Texas and New Mexico, according to Kayrros data. In contrast, the EIA predictions estimated a growth rate of 70 kb/d for the entire Lower 48 States. The official EIA monthly figures for June are expected on Friday.The current Midland to Cushing WTI spread stands around $16/b according to CME group—a historically high number. The future projections show the spread narrowing slowly in accordance with the planned pipeline extensions. The heavy Midland discount is an indicator that producers are using costlier transportation methods, like trains and trucks, to get the oil from where it is produced to where it is stored and refined.Figure 1.
