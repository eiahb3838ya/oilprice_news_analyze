2019-01-28,"China’s crude oil demand has picked up this month, as independent refiners are looking to buy more crude for March and April delivery to restock supplies while oil prices are still relatively low, Reuters reported on Monday, quoting trade sources.Independent refiners—commonly known as teapots—contributed a lot to China’s 30-percent jump in crude oil imports in December compared to a year earlier. The surge was the result of independent refiners rushing to exhaust their import quotas before the end of last year. This pushed the daily rate of shipments into China to 10.31 million bpd. That was the second month in a row when Chinese refiners imported more than 10 million bpd of crude oil, Reuters notes, with the December figure slightly below the record-high November import rate.Independent refiners then slowed down purchases for crude oil delivery for January and February, because Chinese demand for fuel is generally lower during the Lunar New Year holiday, which this year falls next week.In recent weeks, however, teapots have started to buy more crude that will arrive in China in March and April, which has pushed up spot premiums for the independent refiners’ favorite crude grades from Russia, Oman, Africa, and Europe to between $0.50 and $1 higher than quotes from early January, according to Reuters’ trade sources.“It’s as if someone lit a match and the market’s caught fire,” one source told Reuters, but the sources noted that demand would cool by the end of this week—the week before the week-long Lunar New Year holiday in China.  Last year, China’s crude oil refineries processed an average 12.07 million bpd, up by 6.8 percent on the year and the highest daily processing rate on record. The run rates of Chinese refineries are seen to continue rising this year as well, Reuters reported last week, citing forecasts from the research division of state oil and gas giant CNPC. CNPC’s analysts expect run rates at 4.7 percent higher than the 2018 average, at 12.68 million bpd.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Whats-Behind-The-Sudden-Rise-In-Chinese-Oil-Demand.html,"Jan 28, 2019 at 14:09 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Jan 28, 2019",What’s Behind The Sudden Rise In Chinese Oil Demand?
2019-01-28,"Venezuela will continue trading with the United States despite the fact Washington broke off diplomatic relations following president Nicolas Maduro’s inauguration for a second term in office, which the U.S. and a host of other countries decried as illegitimate.Turkey’s Anadolu Agency quoted Maduro as saying, “We have multifaceted relations with the U.S. We’ve cut off the diplomatic and political ties with the U.S. government but our other relations will continue. If they want to buy potatoes, we will sell potatoes. If they want to buy oil, we will sell oil. If they do not want to buy anything, we will not sell.”Venezuela is a major supplier of heavy crude to Gulf Coast refineries, but it is not the only one. Canada is by far the largest supplier of heavy crude to U.S. refiners and Mexico is also a large exporter to its neighbor in the north.Meanwhile, the political situation is Venezuela continues to deteriorate after the president of the opposition-dominated National Assembly, which the Maduro government does not recognize, declared himself interim president and the last elections illegal. President Trump was quick to recognize the opposition leader, Juan Guaido, as the legitimate president of Venezuela.Earlier this month, reports emerged that Washington was once again considering a blanket oil import ban on Venezuelan crude following Maduro’s inauguration. At the time experts weighed in skeptically, saying this could lead to a pretty sharp increase in gasoline prices, which would make the measure unpopular. So far, however, there is no official word of oil sanctions.In the meantime, Venezuela is being rocked by anti-government protests and Guaido has called for more people to take to the streets to topple Maduro. The call came on the heels of an ultimatum from the European Union for Caracas to set a date for new elections. At the same time, Maduro has publicly demonstrated he has the support of the army with a round of military exercises amidst the protests.
