2019-01-03,"The United States received in December the lowest volume of OPEC-derived crude oil in five years, according to market intelligence firm Kpler and data from Refinitive Eikon, cited by Reuters on Thursday.1.63 million bpd of oil from OPEC member countries made its way to US shores in December, down from 1.80 million bpd in November and 1.78 million bpd in October. Saudi Arabia shipped 534,000 barrels per day to the United States in December, a near 100,000 bpd drop from November. Algeria’s shipments were also down almost 100,000 bpd, and Nigeria’s shipments to the US dipped by almost 50,000 bpd.Iraq, on the other hand, increased crude oil shipments to the United States by 140,000 bpd, and for somewhat of a shock, Venezuela shipped 22,738 barrels per day more to the US in December, although the long-term trend here shows a steady decline in Venezuela’s oil exports to the US, which were around 912,000 bpd in 2012, falling to 618,000 bpd by 2017, according to the Energy Information Administration.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Saudi Arabia’s crude oil exports to the US have also been falling steadily in recent years, from 1.361 million bpd in 2012 to 1.052 million bpd in 2015, and then to 949,000 bpd by 2017.The United States has been imported less crude oil altogether—not just less OPEC crude. With the rise of US shale, the United States has cut its thirst for foreign crude oil from 262.8 million barrels per month in January 2017 to 226.6 million in October 2018—the last month for which there is data, according to the EIA.Canada’s exports to the United States, according to the EIA, are holding fast between 3.3 million bpd and 3.5 million bpd for most of 2017 and 2018.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/OPEC-Oil-Exports-To-The-US-Fall-To-Five-Year-Low.html,"Jan 03, 2019 at 14:33 | Julianne Geiger","Jan 03, 2019",OPEC Oil Exports To The U.S. Fall To Five-Year Low
2019-01-03,"When OPEC+ agreed to begin cutting crude oil production again in December, hardly anyone in the cartel thought the effect of the news on prices would be as lackluster as it turned out to be. It took some time for the fact to sink in that this time too many traders were worried about the future of oil demand and were reluctant to speculate with oil. Now OPEC is facing another tough year, perhaps even tougher than 2016, and it might just need to reduce production even more to make it work.“Well, J.P. Morgan said prior to the OPEC meeting early December, that if OPEC didn’t really cut by more than around 1.2 million barrels per day, and they did just for the first half, (not) for the full year, that we could gravitate toward ... our low-oil-price scenario, which is $55 Brent for 2019,” the investment bank’s head of oil and gas for the Asia-Pacific told CNBC this week.“We expect oil markets to remain volatile, in part driven by flexible North American shale production that can ramp up and down quickly in response to changes in investment levels,” ConocoPhillips’ CEO Ryan Lance told Bloomberg, also this week.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();North American shale production is, of course, the number-one challenge for OPEC’s plans. Two years ago it was easier: nobody was sure exactly how flexible shale oil production can be so the OPEC cuts worked, helped by a brighter global economic outlook. Now, things are different. Shale production is growing despite the slump in prices and although this may change if prices fall further or stay at current levels for longer, this is far from certain: in the last week of December, after prices have been on the decline for three months, U.S. drillers continued adding rigs.  Related: The New Oil OrderYet it wasn’t just U.S. production that rose last year: Russia’s hit a new record in 2018, at 11.16 million bpd, which made it the second-largest producer after the United States. Saudi Arabia also pumped at a record level of over 11 million bpd in the months that followed the June OPEC+ decision to reverse the cuts to rein in prices. This is the context in which OPEC+ agreed the new cuts, which were 600,000 bpd lower than the ones agreed in 2016. No wonder skepticism is rife.Some analysts believe that once the cuts enter into effect, which they did at the start of the new year, the effect on prices will come to be felt. But JP Morgan’s Scott Darling may just turn out to be right: yesterday, news that Saudi Arabia had reduced its crude oil exports by half a million barrels daily pushed up prices only briefly before both Brent and West Texas Intermediate faltered and slid down again.While six months may be enough to reduce the combined output of OPEC and its partners by the agreed 1.2 million bpd, if U.S. production continues to grow at the current rate, it would likely offset this cut completely. True, the amount of crude that is added or leaves the global markets is not the only factor that counts: the type of crude is also important, and U.S. oil is overwhelmingly light crude, while there is also global demand for heavier grades that the Middle East and Russia produce. Yet grades are rarely the top concern of traders when they hear words like “oversupply”. Volatility, as Conoco’s Ryan Lance said, is clearly here to stay and will likely intensify in the coming months. OPEC might just be forced to extend the cuts it agreed in December if a positive effect from this agreement fails to materialize soon.

2019-01-03,"Oil prices will remain volatile this year but within range, Moody’s said in its annual report on the oil and gas industry. The top factor to watch in 2019 would be OPEC+ discipline in adhering to the production cut agreement that the group sealed in December.""Market expectations for continued strong oil demand growth remain in place, despite concerns about slowing demand growth as a result of weaker economic growth, the impact of tariffs and a strong U.S. dollar,"" said the credit ratings agency’s managing director for oil and gas, Steve Wood, adding that ""Very high Saudi and Russian production, in particular, has heightened supply volatility, so whether OPEC and Russia maintain production discipline and renew agreements to limit output are key concerns going into the new year.""Moody’s expects West Texas Intermediate to remain within a range of US$50-70 a barrel over the next five years, noting that although efficiency gains have served as tailwinds for U.S. oil production, pipeline bottlenecks have at least partially offset the positive effect by raising transportation costs.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();The agency’s stance is reasonably guarded and echoes other forecasts for oil prices this year. JP Morgan, for example, earlier this week warned that OPEC+ might need to extend the production cuts until the end of the year as rising U.S. production was likely to offset any supply declines.  Related: Oil Begins New Year With A LossFocusing on the U.S. oil and gas industry, Moody’s said investor returns from the upstream segment will remain pressured this year, but it had some good news about the oilfield services sector: there, Moody’s expects a 10-15 percent improvement in earnings. Still, the agency added, on the whole, oilfield services earnings will remain low, with most of the improvement manifesting itself towards the end of the year.Oil prices are currently gaining, after tanker tracking data suggested Saudi Arabia’s crude oil exports in December fell by about half a million barrels daily. At the time of writing, Brent crude traded up 1.15 percent at US$55.54 a barrel with WTI at US$46.74, up by 0.43 percent.
