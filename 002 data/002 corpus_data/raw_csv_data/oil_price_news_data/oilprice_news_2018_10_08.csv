2018-10-08,"Last year, when Oilprice wrote about a rush of investments into North Sea oil and gas, it looked like that part of the oil world was undergoing a seismic shift, with Big Oil being replaced by leaner, private equity-backed field operators that Wood Mackenzie said could turn things around. Technology helped, too. Things were looking up for one of the oldest oil-producing regions in the world. Now, the Big Oil exodus continues, and some analysts and industry insiders worry that the recovery of the North Sea may falter in the not too distant future.Recently, there’s been a string of deals in the North Sea: Equinor earlier this month said it had agreed to buy Chevron’s stake in Rosebank, one of the largest undeveloped oil and gas finds in the British section of the North Sea. For Chevron, the deal is part of a larger plan to exit the North Sea in full. Marathon Oil announced it would leave the North Sea, too, and would instead focus on its domestic operations.Also recently, an independent company, EnQuest, bought the remainder of BP’s stake in the Magnus field. BP went on a selling spree in the North Sea last year, and even offloaded its Forties pipeline. Another local independent, Verus Petroleum, paid $400 million for stakes in several fields, sold by Japanese Itochu.Related: “Profit Secrets of the World’s Most Successful Energy Investors”The Japanese deal is worth noting: S&P Global Platts recently reported some in the industry were worried about the exit of Japanese companies from the North Sea. It quoted an unnamed source as saying Japanese investors in the North Sea were fed up with project delays and cost overruns, so they were leaving for good.""Japan effectively made its decision about the North Sea about three years ago. They would say the operations in the North Sea aren't at all efficient. Largely those criticisms were right. In many ways they're still even right now,"" the source told S&P Global Platts.At the same time, there are all these private equity-backed companies flocking to the North Sea, so all should be good, right? Only it’s not exactly all good. A September report from industry body Oil and Gas UK warned drilling in the North Sea is at the lowest since 1965 and in the near future capacity constraint might emerge across the supply chain.That said, the body also noted that operating costs have fallen by as much as 50 percent and average US$15 a barrel and that production this year will likely be 20 percent higher than four years ago, before the price collapse really hit. The Oil and Gas Authority adds, in its latest industry overview, that breakeven level in the North Sea is now below US$8 per barrel of oil.With falling operating costs and breakeven prices, and with all this private equity money flowing into mature fields and new discoveries, the picture emerges as overall positive for the North Sea. Yet, it could be even better were the government willing to lend a helping hand.Some would say it already did, when it slashed taxes for the oil and gas industry a couple of years ago, but this slashing came too soon after a tax rise in 2011, creating a feeling of uncertainty among delicate investor souls. This, according to analysts and industry insiders S&P Global Platts spoke to, means investors are not all that willing to enter the North Sea, at least not the British North Sea.""We've chosen to invest heavily in Norway because of many things, but its fiscal stability is one of those things. The UK and its instability from a fiscal perspective is a massive detractor and will be for others,” says the CEO of Faroe Petroleum, Graham Stewart. The picture for this part of the oil world, in other words, remains mixed.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/North-Sea-Oil-Renaissance-Could-Flop.html,"Oct 08, 2018 at 13:35 | Irina Slav","Oct 08, 2018",North Sea Oil Renaissance Could Flop
2018-10-08,"The market will never buy Saudi Arabia’s claim that it has been compensating for the loss of Iran’s oil exports, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Monday, adding that Saudi Arabia officials have been claiming they are able to offset Iranian losses under U.S. pressure.“Such brags would only satisfy Mr. Trump but the market would never buy such a claim,” Iran’s oil ministry’s news service Shana quoted Zanganeh as saying, in response to last week’s remarks by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that the Saudis were offsetting Iranian losses and even more.In an interview with Bloomberg last week, Crown Prince Mohammed said that:googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();“[A]ctually the request that America made to Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries is to be sure that if there is any loss of supply from Iran, that we will supply that. And that happened. Because recently, Iran reduced their exports by 700,000 barrels a day, if I’m not mistaken. And Saudi Arabia and OPEC and non-OPEC countries, they’ve produced 1.5 million barrels a day. So we export as much as 2 barrels for any barrel that disappeared from Iran recently. So we did our job and more,” MBS told Bloomberg.According to the Saudi Crown Prince, the higher price of oil over the past month was not the result of the sanctions on Iran, but rather the consequence of lower production in other countries, including Canada, Mexico, Libya, and Venezuela.In reaction to the Saudi claim, the oil minister of Iran—which continues to insist that its export can’t be completely halted—said, as quoted by Shana:“It seems that such remarks were made under U.S. pressure on Saudi authorities; otherwise in reality, neither Saudis nor any other countries could replace Iran’s exports.”  Related: US Demands For More Oil Could BackfireAccording to the Iranian minister, the higher Saudi supply to the market in recent weeks is the result of tapping its oil inventories rather than tapping into its spare capacity.“The market and rising prices are the best evidence of concern that the market is in short supply and is rightly nervous about the severe shortage of oil in the coming months,” Zanganeh was quoted as saying.Iran’s crude oil exports started to noticeably fall in August, continued their decline in September, and the latest tanker tracking data suggests that early October exports are further down from last month. Oil prices, however, fell by more than 1 percent early on Monday morning, on reports that the U.S. Administration might be considering waivers for countries that have been cutting their Iranian oil purchases.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Iran-Saudis-Arent-Replacing-Our-Oil-Exports.html,"Oct 08, 2018 at 12:43 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Oct 08, 2018",Iran: Saudis Aren’t Replacing Our Oil Exports
2018-10-08,"Iran’s crude oil exports plunged to 1.1 million bpd in the first seven days of October, sliding further down from 1.6 million bpd in September as we are just four weeks away from the return of the U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil, Reuters reported on Monday, citing tanker tracking data and an industry source tracking shipments.Tanker shipments may vary week to week in a month, but the very low volumes in early October may suggest that Iran’s crude oil exports are taking a hit and are falling faster than the market had expected just two-three months ago.According to Refinitiv Eikon tanker tracking data quoted by Reuters, not a single tanker headed to Europe in the first seven days of October. Iran’s tankers were bound for China, India, and the Middle East in the first week this month, according to the data.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Iran’s crude oil and condensate exports started to drop noticeably in August and continued to fall through September and now October.According to preliminary tanker tracking data compiled by Bloomberg, observed exports of Iranian crude oil and condensate plunged in September to 1.72 million bpd, down by 260,000 bpd month-on-month and the lowest level since February 2016.  Related: “Profit Secrets of the World’s Most Successful Energy Investors”One tricky thing with ‘observed’ exports is that while officially and publicly visible Iranian tanker movements show a steep decline, shipping and trading sources tell S&P Global Platts that ‘ghost’ shipments may have already started to take place, with Iran thought to have been already switching off transponders on board of some tankers to conceal their destinations.According to S&P Global Platts trade flow data, some one dozen Iranian oil tankers may have shut off their position devices last month. Nearly 207,000 bpd of Iran’s oil exports that left Iranian oil terminals last month is reportedly unaccounted for, because of switched-off transponders.The data visible in tanker tracking flows shows that Iran’s exports in September dropped to all its key customers, including a 12.3-percent drop in shipments to China and a 16.7-percent decline in exports to India, according to Platts data.By Tsvetana Paraskova from Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Irans-Crude-Exports-Plunge-To-11-Million-Bpd.html,"Oct 08, 2018 at 11:53 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Oct 08, 2018",Iran’s Crude Exports Plunge To 1.1 Million Bpd
2018-10-08,"The Yemeni Houthi rebels have detained 10 vessels, including fuel tankers, at the port of Hodeidah, and are preventing them from offloading their cargo, The National reports, citing Yemen’s state news agency Saba, which in turn quoted the chief of the country’s Supreme Relief Committee, Abdulraqeeb Fatah.The author could not find the original news report on Saba’s website. The agency is pro-Houthi.According to the report in The National, the vessels waiting to unload at Hodeidah include an Indian-flagged tanker that arrived in late September with cargo of 10,955 tons of diesel fuel and 9.025 tons of gasoline. Some vessels, the National quoted Fatah as saying, had been held up at the port for as long as six months.The port city is currently a battlefield between the Iran-backed Houthis and the coalition of Saudi and Emirati forces that are trying to restore the elected president of Yemen at the helm. The war has led to a severe humanitarian crisis, but despite multiple similar warnings from a variety of organizations including the UN, there seems to be no end to the conflict in sight.What began as a civil war back in 2015 quickly escalated into a regional conflict after Saudi Arabia decided to join in, along with the UAE. The battle for Hodeidah, which according to many will tip the scales one way or the other, began in June.Yemen’s oil reserves have been estimated at 3 billion barrels. Even before the start of the civil war, the country wasn’t a major oil producer, especially compared to the other countries in the Middle East.Yemen’s production peaked at 441,000 bpd in 2001, according to EIA estimates. Since then, the natural decline of maturing oil fields and frequent attacks on oil infrastructure led to Yemeni production dropping to less than 150,000 bpd in 2013. The year before the 2015 civil war started, Yemen’s crude oil production was estimated at around 100,000 bpd in March 2014, EIA data shows.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Houthi-Rebels-Detain-Fuel-Tankers-At-Oil-Port-Hodeidah.html,"Oct 08, 2018 at 09:21 | Irina Slav","Oct 08, 2018",Houthi Rebels Detain Fuel Tankers At Oil Port Hodeidah
