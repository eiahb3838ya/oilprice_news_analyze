2018-04-26,"U.S. oil exports just hit a record high, a sign that the shale boom will continue to lead to higher shipments abroad, despite some infrastructure bottlenecks.Last week, the U.S. averaged 2.3 million barrels per day in crude oil exports, the highest average for any week on record.The surge in exports is being driven by several factors. The most obvious is the rapid growth in U.S. shale production, with shale drillers adding new supply at a blistering rate. Record production is leading to record exports.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();(Click to enlarge)But also, all of the oil coming out of the Permian basin is light and sweet, and refiners on the Gulf Coast are not equipped to handle ever-increasing volumes of this type of oil. Many of the refiners prefer medium and heavier grades. The result is a glut of light sweet oil, and exporting those volumes are a logical move.Another reason for the upward trend in exports is the renewed price differential between Brent and WTI. While the oil market is global, the two benchmarks reflect some unique geographical circumstances. WTI is dragged down by the surging U.S. shale supply, while Brent is seeing tighter conditions, in part because of the OPEC production cuts, but also because of strong demand in much of the world.  Related: This Discovery Is Changing Solar Energy ForeverA few months ago, Brent only traded at a premium of $2 per barrel relative to WTI. That has widened sharply to more than $6 per barrel in the last week. Cheaper crude from the U.S. makes it more attractive, which leads to higher exports.Meanwhile, when including refined petroleum products, U.S. total petroleum exports hit a record high 8.3 mb/d for the week ending on April 20.The EIA reported a surprise uptick in crude oil and gasoline inventories in its latest report, which weighed on market sentiment. The result was a somewhat mixed bag for oil prices. “The builds in crude oil and gasoline inventories are obviously negative, but soaring crude oil and gasoline exports cut against those data points,” John Kilduff, partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital LLC in New York, told Reuters.As long as the WTI-Brent spread remains at $6 or $7 per barrel, the prospect of higher exports will look promising.Still, there are a few hurdles blocking much higher levels of exports. For one, there are bottlenecks in the Permian basin that could prevent increased volumes from reaching the Gulf Coast. The discount for oil in Midland is approaching $10 per barrel, the highest in years. That is the result of the shrinking availability of space on the region’s pipelines. “We currently see only 250,000 b/d of spare refining/takeaway capacity available, and without additional pipes coming until the second half of 2019, we expect basis to remain an issue for the next 12-15 months,” said Jefferies LLC analyst Mark Lear.Related: A New Lithium War Is About To BeginPhillips 66 just announced that it had received enough commitments from oil producers in the Permian to move ahead with the construction of its Gray Oak Pipeline, which would move oil from the Permian to Corpus Christi. The pipeline would have a capacity of 700,000 bpd, and eventually 1 mb/d, but it won’t come online until the end of 2019.“The Midland-to-Houston spread widening to over $8.00/bbl is significant as this spread implies that all the available crude pipeline takeaway was filled at this time…” according to East Daley Capital analysts, and reported on by Natural Gas Intelligence.Another reason why exports might eventually cap out is that higher shipments will put pressure on the WTI-Brent differential. Moving product out of the U.S. will drain the surplus connected to the WTI benchmark, while adding tons of new supply to the Atlantic Basin will drag down Brent. Higher U.S. oil exports could edge out Nigerian supply in the European market, for instance. Ultimately, as more supplies are shipped to Europe, or elsewhere, Brent will feel the effects. In short, the WTI-Brent discount will narrow again, closing the window on much higher levels of exports.However, that doesn’t mean that U.S. oil exports are set to fall. Far from it. ""We will push into 2 million barrels a day consistently over the summer,"" said Rob Thummel, managing director at Tortoise, told Bloomberg.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Oil-Exports-Are-Only-Heading-Higher.html,"Apr 26, 2018 at 16:38 | Nick Cunningham","Apr 26, 2018",U.S. Oil Exports Are Only Heading Higher
2018-04-26,"Profit season in the oil industry is in full swing, and the mood is upbeat: strict financial discipline is paying off, cash flows are improving (or emerging after a long absence), and the industry is growing again. And there are those who claim that we have seen the last big oil price collapse.Some beg to differ however. A notable voice among the skeptics is Reuters market analyst John Kemp. In a recent column Kemp lays out in detail the reasons why the “It will never happen again” refrain is wishful thinking at best and delusion at worst. The oil industry, he says, has a cyclical nature. Learning from past mistakes, while a good thing generally, cannot help avoid the next bust because boom and bust is the very nature of oil.With the scars from the last bust still fresh, the oil industry is being cautious with new investments, just as it has been after every single bust since the dawn of oil, Kemp notes. Oil companies are suspicious of the price rise, uncertain it will last. And they are quite right to be suspicious, because no boom ever lasts as history has proven time and again. The problem is that nobody can predict the end of the next cycle and the beginning of a new one, hence the caution.So, if nobody can predict the next price collapse, what is the point of having analysts fall over themselves to forecast the unforecastable, namely, future oil prices? Well, here’s a pertinent quote from John Kenneth Galbraith: “Economists don’t forecast because they know, they forecast because they’re asked.”Economic forecasts are notoriously inaccurate, and this is particularly and very emphatically true of oil price forecasts. Here’s another quote, from Rex Tillerson: “We’ve never been good at predicting these (price) cycles, neither when they occur nor their duration. We don’t spend a lot of time even trying.” That’s certainly a smart approach and one that must pay off by saving time, effort, and money.  Related: Are Investors Turning Away From Big Oil?The reasons why predicting the next oil industry cycle is mission impossible come down to the makeup of the oil market and the huge diversity of external factors that have a bearing on prices, and therefore on the cycles. The oil market, Kemp says, is actually a collection of numerous submarkets, and these are well-nigh never in balance. When they are in balance, it’s only for a very short time, so the phrase “balancing the market” is basically nonsense.Outside the market there are thousands of events that can affect oil prices and there is no way on earth anyone can account for each and every one of these thousands of events, ranging from local politics in oil producers and consumers to force majeure events. As Bill Gilmer, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston puts it, the world does not stand still, so the chance of any one analyst or Big Oil CEO getting the price right is pretty much the same as the chance for a tail or a head in a coin flip.So, what is an industry to do in this environment of chronic uncertainty? Ride the cycle, Kemp says. So, producers vow to continue with the strictly disciplined approach to investments. The result will be higher prices stimulating alternative producers, a supply build, and a subsequent fall in prices. Just like every other cycle. The only thing producers could reasonably do, whether Big Oil or OPEC, is plan for the long term and learn to live with the short-term uncertainty.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Forget-Oil-Price-Forecasts-Its-Just-Another-Cycle.html,"Apr 26, 2018 at 16:34 | Irina Slav","Apr 26, 2018","Forget Oil Price Forecasts, It’s Just Another Cycle"
2018-04-26,"Oil majors began to reap the benefits of the higher oil prices and lower costs as early as last year when they started reporting growing profits and improved cash flows.Now they are earning as much income as they did in the middle of 2014, when oil prices were $100 a barrel.The first of the international oil majors to report Q1 2018 financials this earnings season—Statoil (NYSE:STO)—set the pace with the highest earnings since the second quarter of 2014, just before the oil prices crumbled.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();The Norwegian oil major attributed the increase in its Q1 2018 earnings to higher oil prices and higher production volumes. Statoil beat expectations on cash flow—the metric that analysts are closely watching in the oil industry.Despite earning profits like it’s early 2014, the Norwegian group is strictly sticking to its capital expenditure (capex) guidance of US$11 billion for 2018, the same figure it announced in January, despite the clear temptation to boost capex with oil prices being so high.There is growing pressure in the oil industry for companies to keep momentum and keep costs down, and Statoil will be doing that, president and chief executive officer Eldar Sætre told Bloomberg in an interview right after the results release on Wednesday.Statoil reported Q1 adjusted earnings after tax of US$1.473 billion, up by 32 percent compared to Q1 2017, driven by higher prices for both oil and gas, coupled with high production volumes. That’s the highest level of earnings at Statoil since Q2 2014.Production also increased, to 2.18 million barrels of oil equivalent per day from 2.146 million boepd in Q1 2017, mostly thanks to higher production in the United States.  Related: A New Lithium War Is About To BeginCash flow from operations before taxes increased to U$7.1 billion this past quarter, from US$5.9 billion for Q1 2017. The cash flow figure was “very solid” and “a 28 percent beat compared to our estimates for the quarter,” Danske Bank A/S analyst Anders Holte said in a note, as carried by Bloomberg.Statoil is proposing a dividend of US$0.23 per share for Q1, the same as for Q4 2017. In February, the Norwegian oil major proposed to increase the dividend by 4.5 percent to US$0.23 per share. Apart from deciding to lift the dividend, Statoil also ended—as planned—its scrip dividend program in the third quarter of 2017, joining the bigger European oil majors like BP and Shell who also ended their scrip plans under which shareholders could choose to be paid in shares instead of in cash.On Thursday, Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) also reported surging Q1 profit on the back of higher oil prices, with current cost of supply (CCS) earnings—its proxy figure for net income—soaring 42 percent year on year. Cash flow from operations, however, was a bit lighter than analyst had expected.  Related: Expect Much Tighter Oil MarketsAlso on Thursday, France’s Total (NYSE:TOT) lifted Q1 oil and gas production to a record, up 5 percent from Q1 2017, beat adjusted net income estimates after posting a 13-percent increase to US$2.9 billion, raised interim dividend by 3.2 percent, and bought back all shares issued in Q1 as scrip dividend to eliminate dilution and repurchased additional shares to “return to shareholders some benefit resulting from higher oil prices.”The other European oil major, BP, is scheduled to report Q1 results on May 1, while the two U.S. supermajors, Exxon and Chevron, are reporting on Friday, April 27.The oil majors are riding the higher oil prices and most of them are boosting their bottom lines and cash flows. Most are also keeping strict capex discipline—except for Exxon which has bet on aggressive investment and growth – aiming to double earnings and cash flow by 2025.Now that profits back at 2014 levels, all of the majors face another difficult task—convince shareholders that their stocks are worthwhile investment cases—or as Shell’s CEO Ben van Beurden has put it for the company he leads, a “world-class investment case”—amid the ‘peak oil’ and ‘energy transition’ narratives.
