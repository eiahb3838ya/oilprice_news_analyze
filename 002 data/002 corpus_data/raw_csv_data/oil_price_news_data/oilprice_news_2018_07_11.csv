2018-07-11,"Oil prices fell sharply on Wednesday on news that Libya was suddenly set to restore hundreds of thousands of barrels per day, and the U.S. struck a softer line on Iran sanctions.Brent sank more than 6 percent during midday trading on Wednesday, as Libya’s National Oil Corp. (NOC) said that it would lift the force majeure on several major export terminals and resume shipments of oil.The standoff with General Khalid Haftar appeared to be on its way to some sort of resolution, with the militia handing the ports back over to the internationally-recognized NOC in Tripoli. As is always the case with Libya, the situation is fluid, and any return of production does not come with a guarantee that it will be sustained.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();But for now, some 700,000 bpd could swiftly come back online. The outage in Libya had helped drive up oil prices over the past few weeks, fueling speculation that Saudi Arabia would need to burn through much of its spare capacity in order to keep the market well-supplied. The timing was also crucial: Libya’s outage was unexpected, and it came just as Canada temporarily lost 350,000 bpd and the expected interruptions from Iran were revised higher due to a hardline from the U.S. on sanctions.“The lifting of force majeure at all the Libyan ports will certainly come as relief from a supply perspective, but it remains to be seen how quickly exports can return to normal,” Harry Tchilinguirian, head of oil strategy at BNP Paribas, told Reuters Global Oil Forum.Another factor pushing down oil prices midweek were the comments from U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who seemed to soften America’s position as it relates to how severely it would treat countries buying Iranian oil. Late last month, a State Department officials said countries would be expected to take their imports from Iran down to “zero,” and that there would be very few waivers granted, if any. Those comments alone led to a spike in oil prices as the oil market had to reassess how much Iranian supply would be knocked offline.In the intervening weeks, a sense of bullishness has taken over the oil market, with fears that even maximum production from Saudi Arabia wouldn’t be enough to compensate for some 2.5 mb/d of disrupted Iranian supply.On Tuesday, Sec. Pompeo seemed to strike a different tone. “There will be a handful of countries that come to the United States and ask for relief,” Pompeo said on Tuesday in a television interview with Sky News Arabia. “We’ll consider it.”  Related: The Downside Risk For OilA separate State Department official told reporters that the U.S. was working with Saudi Arabia to avoid price volatility. “In our meeting with the Saudi energy minister, we discussed maintaining a well-supplied oil market to guard against volatility,” the unnamed official told reporters, according to Reuters. “We coordinated – we discussed U.S. oil sanctions to deny Iran revenue to finance terrorism. We talked about minimizing market disruptions and helping partners find alternatives to Iranian supply of oil.”While there is no official change in policy, the language was notably softer than what U.S. officials used just a few weeks ago. That opens up the possibility that the U.S. won’t take a “zero tolerance” policy towards countries importing oil from Iran, or that there could be some sort of phased implementation.In addition, in a report published on Wednesday, OPEC downplayed concerns about whether or not it could handle the tightening oil market. In its first forecast for 2019, the cartel predicted that non-OPEC supply growth would be substantial, and that demand growth would cool to 1.45 million barrels per day (mb/d), down from the 1.65 mb/d growth rate from this year.Even if demand remains strong, OPEC production will be more than enough to satisfy the market. “If the world economy performs better than expected, leading to higher growth in crude demand, OPEC will continue to have sufficient supply to support oil-market stability,” OPEC said in its report.  Related: OPEC Won’t Take Additional Action As Oil Prices RiseMeanwhile, one other factor led to the selloff in crude prices on Wednesday. The Trump administration is teeing up another $200 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods, a substantial escalation of the trade war between the two countries. The tariffs are only proposed, for now, and wouldn’t take effect for two months.But the markets did not take the news well, and the prospects of a more severe trade war weighed on oil prices. “If the U.S. implements this additional tax on $200 billion of imported Chinese goods, it will be difficult for China not to impose greater taxes on commodities imported from the U.S.,” Olivier Jakob, head of energy consultancy Petromatrix, told the Wall Street Journal.The fall of oil prices on Wednesday was all the more notable because the EIA reported a massive drawdown in crude inventories. The agency said that stocks fell by whopping 12.6 million barrels in the week ending on July 6. The decline takes total inventories down to 4 percent below the five-year average.Figures like that from the EIA would typically lead to a spike in prices. But oil traders chose to focus on the imminent ramp up of some 700,000 bpd in Libya, combined with the possibility of more tempered losses from Iran as the U.S. has signaled a softening of its approach.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Prices-Crash-As-Libya-Resumes-Production.html,"Jul 11, 2018 at 17:26 | Nick Cunningham","Jul 11, 2018",Oil Prices Crash As Libya Resumes Production
2018-07-11,"It’s becoming painfully clear that the way forward for global oil markets is going to be bumpy, very bumpy, particularly as we head into next year. Much of this uncertainty, even blame, is being increasingly leveled at a person that has surprised, flabbergasted and even shocked political opponents, allies and adversaries alike since he took office - President Donald Trump.A growing line of thought surmises that while Trump uses the presidential bully pulpit, in this case Twitter, to put pressure on long-time ally and de facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia to get ready to pump more oil to keep (both oil and gas) prices from spiraling out of control, much of the blame for higher prices actually belong to Trump.The argument makes perfect sense. If Trump would ease back on both his heated rhetoric toward Iran, though that case could be made over much of Trump’s dealings with China, the EU, Canada and others, and if Trump would revisit his decision on re-imposing sanctions on Iran, then oil markets would benefit. Why? A softer line on Iran would reduce the worry or even fear that a loss of some 2.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude would roil oil markets so much that the Saudis would have to pump an unprecedented amount of oil, perhaps as much as 12.5 million bpd, eating up all of its spare capacity.The Saudi’s have never pumped more than around 10.7 million bpd of oil, a level reached in June, and has for more than 50 years kept at least 1.5-2 million bpd of spare capacity for oil market management.  Related: A Storm Is Brewing For U.S. Oil ExportsUnder such a worst-case scenario, global oil markets would be dangerously exposed to any oil demand/consumption increases as well as geopolitical developments that always take aim at global oil markets. A recent Bloomberg article articulated the problem well. It said that “the simple truth is that there isn’t enough spare capacity in the world to replace the complete loss of Iranian exports.”“Saudi Arabia can boost output to 11.5 million bpd immediately,” the report added, citing a 2016 interview with Saudi Crown Price Mohammed bin Salman. It can also go to 12.5 million in six to nine months, Bloomberg added, but the prince has said nothing since then to suggest the figures have changed.Trump’s thinking called into questionHowever, all of this seems to be lost on Trump. With mid-term November elections approaching and decisive House and Senate seats in contention, much of the second half of the president’s term could be jeopardized if higher gas prices (amid higher oil prices) eat into voters’ pocket books and they take their frustration out at the polls. Trump’s only plan appears to put undue, perhaps geopolitically damaging pressure on the Saudis to make up for anticipated lost barrels when the Saudis likely can’t do it alone.  Related: OPEC Won’t Take Additional Action As Oil Prices RiseIt’s also apparent that Trump has taken an emboldened stance with the Saudis since its Riyadh who was instrumental in Trump’s decision to re-impose Iranian sanctions.With oil production problems persisting in Libya and in Venezuela and with those problems likely to carry into the fall election season and beyond, Trump is playing a dangerous game and could find his back against the wall. Voter angst in November would also spill over into the upcoming 2020 presidential election season. Consequently, the often-used campaign slogan of presidential incumbents, “Re-elect the President” may fall on deaf ears.Two weeks ago, Hootan Yazhari, head of frontier markets equity research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said Trump’s push to disrupt Iranian oil production could cause oil prices to hit $90 per barrel by the end of the second quarter of next year. Others have forecasted even higher prices, breaching the $100 plus per barrel price point.The only option, alluded to at the top of this piece, would be for Trump to re-engage with America’s European allies over Iranian nuclear development and other concerns. This would tone down oil market worries and perhaps even open the door for re-negotiation with both the EU and in time Tehran - in essence, cooler heads and diplomacy would prevail. However, there is little chance that the president would, or even could at this point, change his mind without losing immense political face. Something, thus far, he has been unwilling to do.By Tim Daiss for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oils-Perfect-Storm-Lays-At-Trumps-Feet.html,"Jul 11, 2018 at 14:02 | Tim Daiss","Jul 11, 2018",Oil’s Perfect Storm Lays At Trump’s Feet
2018-07-11,"Some of the United States’ closest allies are scrambling to find a way around the latest sanctions of the Trump Administration against Tehran, and Washington may have to revise its goal of reducing Iranian oil exports to zero.Bloomberg recently reported, citing unnamed sources in the know, that Japan, for one, might have to stop loading Iranian crude in September unless it manages to score a waiver with the State Department.South Korea earlier denied reports that it will stop buying Iranian crude from July, but now there are more reports, saying that the country, one of the world’s top oil importers, is having problems with tanker insurance as some of the largest maritime insurers refuse to touch Iranian vessels under the shadow of sanctions.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();India is yet another case in point. The world’s fastest-growing economy has been importing Iranian crude at an average daily rate of 588,000 bpd since the start of the year. This makes it Iran’s second-largest client after China, and the nation that is struggling most as the sanctions start date approaches.The problem is not exclusively related to commodities, however. Iran’s oil clients have also been actively working to improve bilateral relations after the inking of the nuclear deal. “Japanese companies were beginning to look toward Iran as an attractive investment destination,” a senior economist from Japan Research Institute Ltd. told the Japan Times recently.Japan is by no means the only oil-hungry country looking for new investment opportunities in Iran. India has also been planning substantial investments in Iran, and just yesterday Iran criticized New Delhi for failing to make good on a promise to finance the expansion of a strategic port. The deputy ambassador of Tehran in India warned the country that Iran will strip it of its “special privileges” if it stops buying Iranian crude.  Related: Spare Capacity: The Biggest Mystery In Oil MarketsFor Japan, South Korea, and India the problem of oil supplies is actually one of balancing interests. “We are in a knotty situation as we have to listen to the U.S., but at the same time Iran is an important supplier of crude and condensate,” a research fellow from the Korea Energy Economics Institute told Bloomberg. “It’s the Trump administration that we are dealing with, and that unpredictability is stoking concern among refiners and petrochemical companies in Asia, making them voluntarily cut their shipments from Iran before the deadline.”It seems some of this frustration has gotten through to Washington. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo yesterday said that “There will be a handful of countries that come to the United States and ask for relief from that. We’ll consider it.”Pompeo did not name any countries, but the statement is significant enough: perhaps Washington is ready to accept something milder than an export reduction to zero to maintain its relationships with key Asian allies. Or maybe it has become evident even for the Trump administration that the insistence on an oil export reduction to zero has only served to stoke the oil price rally at a time when Republicans are preparing for midterm elections in November and prices at the pump are in the spotlight for voters.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Will-The-US-Compromise-On-Iran-Oil-Sanctions.html,"Jul 11, 2018 at 13:55 | Irina Slav","Jul 11, 2018",Will The U.S. Compromise On Iran Oil Sanctions?

Related: OPEC Won’t Take Additional Action As Oil Prices RiseNon-OPEC oil supply is expected to grow by 2.1 million bpd year on year in 2019, broadly unchanged from 2018, mainly due to higher production in North America and new project ramp-ups in Brazil, while Mexico, Norway, and China are expected to lead the non-OPEC supply declines on the back of absence of new projects and heavy declines in mature fields.For U.S. shale growth, OPEC expects it to “slow down considerably” in the second half of this year, and expects this slowdown to continue into 2019 as the Permian faces takeaway capacity constraints.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/OPEC-Oil-Demand-Growth-To-Slow-In-2019.html,"Jul 11, 2018 at 12:15 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Jul 11, 2018",OPEC: Oil Demand Growth To Slow In 2019
2018-07-11,"OPEC needs to pay more attention to the movement of oil prices and take action to reduce them or it will find itself with a slowdown in demand on its hands. That’s what Indian Oil Corp’s chairman said as quoted by Bloomberg, adding that the negative effect on demand will become evident in the longer run, with as much as 1 million bpd in Indian demand erased by a switch to natural gas and electric cars by 2025.India imports most of the oil it consumes, which makes it extremely sensitive to changes in international benchmark prices. The country already called on OPEC to take the lid off production earlier this year, and OPEC heeded the call. Yet prices are once again rising to levels that from the Indian perspective are unreasonable, as Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan called them.The drivers behind this latest rally smack of a perfect storm: a deadline for U.S. sanctions drawing nearer and the U.S. pressuring its allies to cut imports from the country to zero; a production outage in Libya that’s taken off most of the country’s production offline; and another outage, in Canada that has dented production by more than 300,000 bpd.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();The Iran problem is the most sensitive for India, which has maintained good relations with both the United States and Iran.

Later on, when the implications of going against the world’s biggest financial system became apparent, New Delhi folded, sparking criticism both at home and in Iran.The situation is indeed conducive to finding alternatives to crude oil, and consumers in India are certainly looking for them. That should be good news for the EV industry and other alternative technologies. Some observers are skeptical that alternatives to fossil fuels will catch on quickly enough—but then, IOC’s chairman said, economic growth nor oil demand growth is not a given.“We have told them [OPEC],” Sanjiv Singh said, “kindly don’t think growth will come only because everyone is projecting it.

2018-07-11,"Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) lifted on Wednesday the force majeure on four ports in the eastern part of the country after the export terminals were handed over to the Tripoli-based internationally recognized Libyan oil company.“Production and export operations will return to normal levels within the next few hours,” the NOC said in a statement today, lifting the ten-day force majeure on the ports of Ras Lanuf, Es Sider, Hariga, and Zuetina, which had crippled Libyan production. Analysts and market participants were worried that this supply disruption reduced global oil supply amid plunging Venezuelan production, an outage in Canada’s oil sands, and looming sanctions on Iran’s oil, and would push oil prices further upwards.Last month, after two weeks of fighting with several other armed groups at Libyan ports, the Libyan National Army (LNA)—an eastern government-affiliated militia—decided to give control of the ports to the eastern NOC.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();The two NOCs—the eastern NOC and the Tripoli-based NOC—have been vying for control over Libya’s oil riches for years.

The NOC confirmed on July 2 that the total daily production loss amounted to 850,000 bpd of crude oil.Today, NOC said that its chairman Mustafa Sanalla and the board of directors “commended the Libyan National Army General Command for putting the national interest first.”  Related: A Storm Is Brewing For U.S. Oil Exports“We need a proper national debate on the fair distribution of oil revenues.

However, since then it has become evident that this is easier said than done, and the pressure has subsided somewhat although the State Department is still firm in its insistence that every barrel of Iranian oil sold abroad is a sanction violation on the part of the buyer.Meanwhile, the trade spat between the U.S. and China is increasingly looking like a full-fledged hot war.
