2018-09-19,"OPEC members and their Russia-led non-OPEC allies have yet to decide how to share the 1 million bpd production boost they pledged in June. when they saw the market started to tighten too quickly which pushed oil prices to $80 a barrel—potentially ringing in the beginning of demand destruction.At a meeting this weekend in Algiers, OPEC and allies are expected to tackle the issue with the distribution of that 1 million bpd production boost, but the cartel and its key non-OPEC partner, Russia, are looking (years) beyond the short-term production quotas.They want long-term control over the oil market and oil prices, although their preferred wording is ‘market stability and balance’.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Robust global oil demand is beginning to face some headwinds as a result of factors that we have little or no control over, OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo told Bloomberg in a recent interview in Dubai.OPEC is looking forward to continuing to work together with its non-OPEC partners, not only to strive to keep the supply-demand balance, but also to ensure that this equation remains favorable not only for producers, but also for consumers, OPEC’s chief said.“Our ultimate objective as a producer group is to see that, despite the urge for diversification of the sources of energy, of which our member countries also play a role; we would like to see oil continue to be the energy source of choice for the foreseeable future,” he added.Asked about the future of the OPEC/non-OPEC production cut deal that has been in place since January 2017, Barkindo told Bloomberg:“There is no viable alternative on the table other than to institutionalize and make this cooperation between ourselves and our good partners from non-OPEC in a permanent fashion.”  Related: Norway’s Offshore Oil Boom Is Back OnThe oil industry needs it, and we are beginning to see the stability returning, the OPEC chief noted.Saudi Arabia’s Khalid al-Falih and Russia’s Alexander Novak—the energy ministers of the respective leaders of the OPEC and non-OPEC group of producers that are part of the deal, met this weekend in Moscow to discuss the state of the oil market, affirmed their readiness to react to changes in the oil market, and reiterated their plans to make the cooperation long-term, the Russian Energy Ministry said.“Both Al-Falih and Novak reiterated their joint commitment to ensuring the adequacy of oil supplies, particularly in light of the uncertainties in the markets,” the Saudi Press Agency said about the meeting.“The two Ministers reiterated their determination to continue working towards establishing a long-term cooperation framework between OPEC and non-OPEC producer countries to serve as a basis for proactively promoting market stability while serving the interests of producers, consumers and the global economy,” the Saudi statement said.Earlier this month, OPEC’s Barkindo said that the world would hit the 100 million bpd level of consumption in the fourth quarter of 2018, “much sooner than projected.”A week later, OPEC revised down its global oil demand growth estimate for this year and next, for a second consecutive month, pointing at a combination of factors that could slow down global economic growth—monetary tightening from central banks, weakening finances in some emerging and developing economies, rising trade tensions, and ongoing geopolitical concerns.  Related: Oil Companies Slash Debt To Pre-Crash LevelsVery strong demand over the past year and a half-helped OPEC and friends a lot in their mission to bring the oil market back to balance. But now the headwinds for the global economy and oil demand have OPEC worried that a slackening demand could depress oil prices, hurt OPEC member oil incomes and economies again, and ruin the market stability.But too much tailwind for oil prices due to reduced supply expected from Venezuela’s plunging production and returning U.S. sanctions on Iran, is not OPEC’s preferred solution either. Higher prices support rival oil production, most notably in the United States, and could hurt the emerging economies’ oil demand due to the combination of high oil prices and weakening emerging market currencies.OPEC and allies’ response to these conflicting market forces is ‘stability’—tweak supply to keep oil prices high enough for oil producing nations’ revenues, but not too high to let demand be destroyed or rival supply to rise too much. OPEC and friends are now aiming at institutionalizing the ‘market stability’ efforts to continue to influence the oil market and prices for years to come.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Why-Oil-Markets-Cant-Escape-OPEC-Russia-Influence.html,"Sep 19, 2018 at 16:16 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Sep 19, 2018","Why Oil Markets Can’t Escape OPEC, Russian Influence"
2018-09-19,"Iran’s oil exports started to fall noticeably in August as key customers in Asia began to curtail oil purchases to either comply with the U.S. efforts to bring Iranian exports to zero, or to win waivers with the U.S. Administration.Iran’s crude oil and condensate sales fell in August to below 2 million bpd—the lowest level in more than a year, according to tanker tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.In September, the trend of reduced Iranian oil exports has continued, and analysts expect further cuts from some of Iran’s oil customers.Going forward, there are two major factors for estimating how low Iranian oil exports could sink. One is how much of Iran’s oil China, India, and Europe will buy in October and then in November, when the sanctions kick in. The other is the concern that tanker tracking data may become less reliable, as Iran may try to use some ‘unconventional’ methods of keeping its oil sales on track, like switching off tracking devices on tankers—a ‘solution’ that Tehran is said to have used in the previous round of sanctions in 2012-2015.Between September 1 and 15, however, Iran’s crude oil and condensate exports surprisingly increased by around 200,000 bpd compared to the August 1-15 period, preliminary trade flow data by S&P Global Platts showed this week.Iran’s crude and condensate exports averaged 1.69 million bpd in the first half of September, up from 1.48 million bpd for the August 1-15 period.Yet, if the trend this month continues, Iran’s oil exports would still be around 200,000 bpd lower than in August, when exports had averaged 1.92 million bpd, down from 2.32 million bpd in July, according to Platts estimates.In the first two weeks of September, Iran’s crude oil exports made up 1.5 million bpd of the 1.69 million bpd total, while the rest was condensate, the ultra-light oil that Iran produces from its natural gas fields, Platts data showed.According to Bloomberg tanker tracking data, Iran’s crude exports from September 1 through to September 15 were 1.6 million bpd, with condensate exports at another 190,500 bpd, for a total of around 1.8 million bpd.  Related: Are Flying Taxis Just 4 Years Away?Crude exports at 1.6 million bpd are down by around 35 percent compared to Iran’s peak 2.5 million bpd exports in April, just before the U.S. announced it was slapping sanctions back on Tehran.Iran’s key customers—no.1 China and no.2 India—are not expected to cut off their imports of Iranian oil, although India may reduce some of its Iranian intake as it tries to maneuver between cheap Iranian crude and U.S. pressure to curtail imports.India wants to keep importing oil from Iran, because Tehran offers some discounts and incentives for Indian buyers at a time when the Indian government is struggling with higher oil prices and weakening local currency that additionally weighs on its oil import bill.In the first half of September, India’s imports from Iran dropped to 114,267 bpd from 134,267 bpd for August 1-15, although purchases from Indian state refiners are expected to recover in the latter half of this month, according to Platts, which estimates that Indian imports averaged 428,710 bpd for the month of August.India is looking to win waivers, and its Iranian imports this month and next are expected to be 45 percent lower than the average between April and August—360,000 bpd-370,000 bpd for September/October compared to 658,000 bpd for April-August, according to data from trade sources obtained by Reuters.Iran’s top oil customer China is not expected to cut its Iranian purchases, especially with the escalating U.S.-China trade war.From September 1 to September 15, China’s oil imports from Iran surged to 813,333 bpd, nearly double the 466,333 bpd imports in August 1-15. For the whole month of August, Chinese imports from Iran averaged 505,033 bpd, Platts data showed.Iran’s sales to Europe in the first half of September also jumped, with purchases from Italy, Spain, and Turkey steady. While Turkey may keep Iranian oil flowing, analysts widely expect EU companies in Italy, Spain, and France to cut off oil trade with Iran for fear of being cut off from the U.S. financial system.  Related: Can India Afford To Cut Iranian Imports To Zero?While initial estimates earlier this year suggested that Iran could lose around 500,000 bpd of oil exports, in recent weeks analysts have started to warn that losses could be higher than 1 million bpd.Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at Energy Aspects, expects Iran’s exports to drop by between 1.5 million to 1.7 million bpd from the 2017 average—from about 2.7 million bpd-2.8 million bpd earlier this year to about 1 million bpd-1.2 million bpd by the end of this year, additionally tightening the market and potentially pushing oil prices into the $90s.“Things are tightening up”, said the International Energy Agency (IEA) last week, expecting Brent Crude to break above $80 if other producers don’t make up for Iranian (and Venezuelan) losses.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Just-How-Low-Can-Irans-Oil-Exports-Go.html,"Sep 19, 2018 at 15:57 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Sep 19, 2018",Just How Low Can Iran’s Oil Exports Go?
2018-09-19,"After API’s latest surprise inventory build pressured oil prices, the Energy Information Administration cheered the market up by refuting the build and reporting instead yet another weekly draw, of 2.1 million barrels for the week to September 14.Last week, the authority estimated crude oil inventories had fallen by another 5.3 million barrels, indicating that demand was still strong. The coming weeks, however, might see a reversal of this trend, with builds accumulating amid refinery maintenance season. For many refiners, this is the last chance to join low-sulfur fuel oil and diesel fuel producers who are set to benefit the most from the new bunkering fuel regulations to come into effect in 2020.Until refinery maintenance kicks in, however, U.S. facilities processed 17.4 million barrels of crude daily in the week to September 14, compared with 17.9 million bpd a week earlier.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Gasoline inventories went down by 1.7 million barrels last week, compared with a build of 1.3 million barrels a week earlier. These, like distillate fuel inventories, are also expected to start building up during refinery maintenance season, but also because the winter is a weaker season in terms of fuel demand. Distillate fuel inventories last week added 800,000 barrels, from a substantial increase of 6.2 million barrels a week earlier.As for U.S. production, the EIA earlier this week forecast in its latest Drilling Productivity Report that shale oil production will expand further next month, to 7.59 million barrels daily, or 79,000 bpd more than this month’s daily average.Earlier this month, in its Short-Term Energy Outlook, the EIA reported preliminary production estimates suggest the United States had overtaken Russia as the world’s top crude oil producer, pumping 10.9 million bpd on average in August. Next year, the EIA estimated, daily production will hit an average of 11.5 million bpd, up from this year’s estimated 10.7 million bpd.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Prices-Inch-Higher-On-Crude-Gasoline-Draw.html,"Sep 19, 2018 at 09:44 | Irina Slav","Sep 19, 2018","Oil Prices Inch Higher On Crude, Gasoline Draw"
