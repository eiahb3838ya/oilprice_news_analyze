2019-02-19,"A PetroChina test oil well at a shale field in western China could finally mean a strong commercial potential for shale oil for the first time in the world’s top crude importer, according to Morgan Stanley.  PetroChina achieved a daily production rate of 100 tons of oil, or 733 barrels, from the Jimsar oil field in the western Xinjiang province, which suggests that shale drilling could finally have a true commercial potential in China, Bloomberg quoted a Morgan Stanley note as saying.“We believe the Jimsar shale oil discovery is likely to trigger China’s shale oil revolution,” Morgan Stanley analyst Andy Meng wrote in the report.The potential for more drilling would likely increase capex for shale this year and benefit onshore oilfield service companies, the investment bank said.   The shale boom in China, however, would be just a fraction of the U.S. shale revolution—Morgan Stanley expects Chinese shale oil production could be 100,000 bpd-200,000 bpd by 2025, which is nothing compared to the millions of barrels of oil pumped in the U.S. every day. According to EIA estimates, the seven key shale regions in the U.S. produced 8.117 million bpd in January, and a 62,000-bpd increase is expected for February.China’s biggest energy producers have started to tap more tight oil and gas wells recently, aiming to increase domestic oil and natural gas production at the world’s largest crude oil importer.As part of a government push to boost domestic energy supply, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and Sinopec are raising investments to increase local oil and gas production and are accelerating drilling at tight oil and gas formations in western China, the companies said last year.Oil demand continues to grow in China, while domestic production has been declining in recent years due to the depletion of mature conventional oil fields. This has led to additional—and costly—imports, making China the world’s largest crude oil importer. Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered the state-held companies to boost domestic production of oil and gas, and firms are starting to follow the policy.

2019-02-19,"The European Union recently updated its gas pipeline rules in a bid to assuage concerns about its deepening dependence on Russian gas. The move was generally praised by Nord Stream 2 opponents, but guardedly, since the update did not halt the project but will merely slow it. However controversial, the project will be among the factors that will benefit gas consumers in Europe amid stiffer competition from other exporters of natural gas.Germany, the largest gas market in Europe and biggest buyer of Russian gas as well as the strongest supporter of Nord Stream, said it will build two LNG terminals as part of efforts to diversify its sources of the fuel as it phases out coal and nuclear power plants under pressure from the green lobby. U.S. LNG is a natural candidate for these terminals but not the only one: Russia’s Novatek also exports LNG to Europe, and since its Yamal plant is quite a bit closer to the continent than Cheniere Energy’s Sabine Pass plant, its prices are more attractive.This means Russia is playing on the European gas market with two players rather than just one and that would make it more challenging for U.S. LNG to grab a bigger market share. Yet the challenge can be overcome: as U.S. Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said earlier this year during a visit to Germany, as more LNG production capacity comes on stream in the United States, prices will fall further, making the commodity competitive with Russian piped gas and Russian LNG.Some doubt how soon this will happen and one of these is commodity strategist Christopher Louney from RBC Capital. Last month Louney told CNBC ""Europe taking U.S. LNG and U.S. LNG challenging Russian pipeline supplies for dominance are two very different things. Europe has already taken U.S.-sourced LNG over the past two years with just a couple of export terminals in operation. With more U.S. export facilities coming online, the number of takers and volume taken can both increase, but there is a long way to go to compete (with Russia) for pre-eminence."" It won’t happen overnight, in other words, but U.S. LNG does have a promising future in Europe.

TAP is a key part of the Southern Gas Corridor—a key infrastructure project for Europe aimed at diversifying gas supplies away from Russia and bringing natural gas from the Caspian Sea region to European markets. The Southern Gas Corridor consists of several separate energy projects with a total investment of around US$40 billion. The US$28-billion Shah Deniz 2 gas development in Azerbaijan, which BP and its partners started up in July last year, is the starting point of the Southern Gas Corridor.So, more gas is coming into Europe over the next few years and demand will likely continue growing as it has been for the last four years, according to figures from the Oxford Energy Institute. As is usually the case, more supply will pressure prices and stimulate even stronger demand. This may add a challenge to producers’ efforts to keep their prices low but profitable, but the challenge is just part of the game.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Cheaper-Natural-Gas-Is-Coming-To-Europe.html,"Feb 19, 2019 at 13:36 | Irina Slav","Feb 19, 2019",Cheaper Natural Gas Is Coming To Europe
