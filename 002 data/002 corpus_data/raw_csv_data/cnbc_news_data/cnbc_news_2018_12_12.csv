2018-12-12,"SINGAPORE, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday, buoyed by a drawdown in U.S. crude inventories and signs that China is taking more concrete steps to put a trade war truce with Washington into action. Crude oil prices have also been supported by OPEC-led supply curbs announced last week, although gains were capped after the producer group lowered its 2019 demand forecast. International Brent crude oil futures were at $60.46 per barrel at 0213 GMT, up 31 cents, or 0.52 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $51.40 per barrel, up 25 cents or, 0.49 percent.

China made its first major U.S. soybean purchases in more than six months on Wednesday, while Beijing also appears to be easing its high-tech industrial push, dubbed ""Made in China 2025,"" which has long irked Washington. A drop in U.S. crude stockpiles, though less than expected, has helped boost sentiment, analysts said. U.S. crude inventories fell by 1.2 million barrels in the week to Dec. 7, compared with market expectations for a decrease of 3 million barrels. Meanwhile, the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said 2019 demand for its crude would fall to 31.44 million barrels per day, 100,000 bpd less than predicted last month and 1.53 million less than it currently produces. This adds to the concerns of several market watchers that the decision led by the group to cut production by 1.2 million bpd overall might not be enough to override a glut, especially on the back of soaring U.S. output. ""The U.S. is pumping oil like its going out of fashion and that's providing issues for the traditional supply-demand/OPEC dynamic,"" said Hue Frame, portfolio manager at Frame Funds in Sydney. The United States, where crude production <C-OUT-T-EIA> has hit a record 11.7 million bpd, is set to end 2018 as the world's top oil producer, ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia.

2018-12-12,"NEW YORK, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Oil pared gains Wednesday after U.S. crude inventories fell less than expected, but remained supported by a cut in Libyan exports and an OPEC-led deal to trim output. U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 1.2 million barrels in the week to Dec. 7, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said, smaller than the draw reported by industry group the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday and less than half the draw of 3 million barrels analysts had forecast. Gasoline inventories rose in the week, the EIA said. ""The divergence from the large inventory decline reported by the API makes the report appear more negative than it actually was,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York. ""The rebound in gasoline demand was notable, and should stay strong, now, into year-end, during the holiday shopping season."" Brent crude futures rose 35 cents a barrel to $60.55 by 10:43 a.m. EDT (1443 GMT), paring gains from the session high of $61.43 a barrel. U.S. futures were up 13 cents a barrel at $51.78, off the session high of $52.88. The oil price has fallen by a third since the start of October, when it hit a four-year high above $87. It is set for its biggest quarterly slide since the fourth quarter of 2014. Oil prices drew support this week after Libya declared force majeure on exports from its largest oilfield on Sunday after tribesmen and state security guards seized the facility. The Libyan outage followed last week's decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some non-OPEC producers including Russia to cut supply by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) for six months from Jan. 1. ""The OPEC+ deal from last week will allow more of a bullish position to be taken up by some market participants from this point,"" analysts at JBC Energy said in a report. ""The crude picture at least looks somewhat firmer for the next six months than it did previously."" Still, a weaker economic outlook and higher production elsewhere have limited price gains. Crude output has surged in the United States, set to end 2018 as the world's top oil producer, ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia. ""We are quite confident that OPEC+ will be successful in tightening up the front end of the oil market thus keeping the Brent crude oil one-month contract in $60+ a barrel territory over the next six months,"" SEB commodities strategist Bjarne Schieldrop said.

2018-12-12,"(Adds details, oil prices, quotes) Dec 12 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil stockpiles last week fell less than expected, while gasoline inventories increased and distillates stocks fell, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude inventories fell by 1.2 million barrels in the week to Dec. 7, compared with analysts' expectations for a decrease of 3 million barrels. The crude drawdown was also short of an over 10 million-barrel decline reported late Tuesday by industry group The American Petroleum Institute. ""The market is disappointed that the EIA did not confirm the 10 million-barrel crude oil inventory draw we saw in the API statistics yesterday and as a result the crude oil price has come off,"" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. After the EIA data release, U.S. crude futures fell from earlier highs and were up 24 cents to $51.89 a barrel as of 10:49 a.m. EST (1549 GMT). Brent were 59 cents higher at $60.78 a barrel. Gasoline stocks rose by 2.1 million barrels, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 2.5 million-barrel gain. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 1.5 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.8 million-barrel increase, the EIA data showed. ""Overall, demand is still strong in the U.S., which should be supportive. The crude oil build and the gasoline build was one of the negative factors, but looking at the overall report, theres nothing really bearish in here, said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Refinery crude runs fell by 51,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates fell by 0.4 percentage point. Net U.S. crude imports rose last week by 1.1 million barrels per day. In the week to Nov. 30, the United States became a net exporter of oil for the first time in decades, shipping out a net 211,000 bpd when looking at combined totals for crude and fuel. That reversed this week, as the U.S. imported a net 1.3 million bpd of crude and fuel, largely due to a rebound in U.S. imports. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub rose by 1.1 million barrels, EIA said. U.S. crude production dipped 100,000 bpd to 11.6 million bpd lat week, the EIA said.

2018-12-12,"OPEC may not have gone far enough to hoist oil prices through 2019 — and a weak demand outlook could prompt the need for another production cut by the cartel and its allies by spring next year, Citi's top commodities analyst said Wednesday. ""I think they went far enough for the time being,"" Ed Morse, Citi's global head of commodities research, told CNBC, describing last weekend's OPEC and non-OPEC agreement led by Saudi Arabia and Russia to cut crude output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) by January. ""They're going to have to re-address this issue sometime next year, but I'm glad they're meeting for their sake in April, and it may be by April they're going to have to confront another cut,"" Morse said of the organization's next summit in Vienna. When asked about the size of this potential cut, Morse stopped short of making a call, instead pointing to the bigger picture: booming production volumes from the U.S. threatening OPEC's power to shape the oil market.

2018-12-12,"Dec 12 (Reuters) - Oil producer cartel OPEC and its partners will need to keep production lower than their agreed target through 2019 for benchmark Brent crude to come back to $70 a barrel, oil and gas consultancy Rystad Energy said. Last week, the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its Russia-led allies agreed to slash oil production by a bigger-than-expected 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd). The producer group needs to stay 700,000 bpd below its agreed target of 31.8 million bpd through 2019 in order to bring a recovery in benchmark Brent crude prices to the $70 per barrel level, Rystad analyst Bjornar Tonhaugen said in a note. ""The agreed production cuts will not be enough to ensure sustained and immediate recovery in oil prices,"" Tonhaugen said. Crude prices have see-sawed of late on worries of a global economic slowdown on one hand, and a boost from production cuts on the other. Brent crude futures, currently trading at just over $61 a barrel, have lost nearly a third of their value since reaching a four-year high of $86.74 in early October.

2018-12-12,"Oil production from OPEC nations dipped in November, as a sharp drop in Iranian supplies offset a surge in Saudi output to all-time highs.

OPEC alone will slash output by 800,000 bpd. The decision follows a plunge in oil prices since the start of October, in part due to projections that the oil market will be oversupplied next year.

2018-12-12,"SINGAPORE, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose by around 1 percent on Wednesday amid a stock market rebound and on expectations that an OPEC-led output cut for 2019 would stabilise the supply-demand balance. Disruptions to Libyan crude exports after local militia seized the country's biggest oilfield, El Sharara, were also buoying prices, traders said. International Brent crude oil futures were at $60.84 per barrel at 0742 GMT, up 64 cents, or 1.1 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $52.06 per barrel, up 41 cents, or 0.8 percent. The higher prices came amid an increase in Asian share markets on Wednesday.

Some analysts warn, though, that the agreement may not have the effect hoped for. Fereidun Fesharaki of energy consultancy FGE said in a note that the OPEC-led cuts would likely be ""insufficient to mop up the inventories in the targeted three-month period till the end of the first quarter of 2019"". As a result, FGE said prices were ""likely to hover in the $55-$60 per barrel range for Brent, with WTI sitting some $5-$10 per barrel below this given current fundamentals"".
