2019-01-15,"SINGAPORE, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Oil prices were steady on Wednesday as signs of a global economic slowdown were countered by OPEC-led supply cuts which helped support Brent crude futures above $60 per barrel. International Brent crude oil futures were at $60.66 per barrel at 0444 GMT, 2 cents above their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were flat from their last settlement, at $52.11 a barrel. ""Fundamentals offer no clear price direction,"" said Norbert Ruecker, head of commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer. Prices were prevented from rising as signs of a global economic slowdown mounted. China, Asia's biggest economy, faces rising trade uncertainties this year, a commerce ministry official said on Wednesday, after the government earlier this week reported poor December trade data, with both exports and imports contracting from a year earlier. In Japan, core machinery orders slowed sharply in November in a sign corporate capital expenditure could lose momentum as a bruising U.S.-China trade war spills into the global economy. Adding to the trade woes, the U.S. economy is taking a larger-than-expected hit from a partial government shutdown, White House estimates showed on Tuesday, as contractors and even the Coast Guard go without pay and talks to end the impasse seem stalled. The outlook for the global economy darkened further when British lawmakers on Tuesday overwhelmingly rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's deal to leave the European Union. OPEC CUTS SUPPORT CRUDE Despite this, oil markets are receiving support from supply cuts started late last year by producer group the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and major non-OPEC producer Russia. However, surging U.S. crude oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA>, which hit a record 11.7 million barrels per day (bpd) late last year, threatens to undermine the OPEC-led efforts. U.S. crude oil output is expected to rise to a record of more than 12 million bpd this year and to climb to nearly 13 million bpd next year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday, in its first 2020 forecast. With so much uncertainty around demand and supply, the outlook for oil markets is unclear. Oil prices are expected to oscillate close to current levels, according to a large annual survey of energy professionals conducted by Reuters between Jan. 8 and 11, with Brent prices in 2019 expected to average $65 per barrel, unchanged from surveys in 2016, 2017 and 2018.

2019-01-15,"SYDNEY, Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices inched lower on Wednesday after gains of more 3 percent in the previous session, pressured by concerns over the outlook for the global economy. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $51.82 per barrel at 0024 GMT, down 29 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. Oil prices jumped around 3 percent on Tuesday when China's National Development and Reform Commission signalled a willingness to offer more fiscal stimulus following weaker-than-expected trade figures earlier in the week. But that appeared to offer only temporary support to crude prices amid persistent worries over the impact of the Sino-U.S. trade conflict. ""Trade data out of China this week was not positive with drops in exports and imports showing a clear impact of U.S. tariffs,"" said Alfonso Esparza, senior market analyst at futures brokerage, Oanda. The outlook for the global economy was darkened further when British lawmakers on Tuesday overwhelmingly rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's deal to leave the European Union. Global demand has emerged as a key driver for oil prices as fears of oversupply were tempered when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and major crude producer Russia said late last year that they would cut supply. However, U.S. crude oil is expected to rise to a new record of more than 12 million barrels per day (bpd) this year and to climb to nearly 13 million bpd next year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday in its first 2020 forecast.

2019-01-15,"The U.S. will make major strides towards energy independence in the next two years as oil production and exports hit new highs, according to the Department of Energy. U.S. oil production, already at an all-time high this year, will increase by another 2 million barrels per day by 2020, the agency's statistics bureau projects. The same year, the nation will start exporting more crude oil and fuel than it imports, the Energy Information Administration said in in its latest forecast. American drillers pumped an average 10.9 million bpd in 2018, breaking the record going back to 1970. EIA sees U.S. output averaging 12.1 million bpd this year and 12.9 million bpd in 2020.

2019-01-15,"The Trump administration is leaving itself wiggle room to continue allowing Iran to export oil, potentially setting up another catalyst for lower crude prices later this year. The administration's special representative for Iran, Brian Hook, last weekend refused to say with certainty whether the White House will enforce sanctions more strictly on the Islamic Republic's oil exports. Instead, he left the door open to extending exemptions that have allowed some of Iran's biggest customers to continue importing its crude. The administration's decision in November to grant sanctions waivers to eight countries, including China and India, surprised the market and contributed to a three-month collapse in crude oil prices.
