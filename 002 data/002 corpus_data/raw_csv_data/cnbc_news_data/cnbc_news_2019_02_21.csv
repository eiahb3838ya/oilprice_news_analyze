2019-02-21,"U.S. output to hit 13 million bpd by end-2019 -Citi By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday after the United States reported its crude output hit a record 12 million barrels per day (bpd), undermining efforts by Middle East-dominated producer club OPEC to withhold supply and tighten global markets. International Brent crude futures were at $66.87 per barrel at 0326 GMT, down 20 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $56.84 per barrel, down 12 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last settlement. U.S. crude oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA> reached 12 million bpd for the first time last week, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Thursday in a weekly report. That means U.S. crude output has soared by almost 2.5 million bpd since the start of 2018, and by a whopping 5 million bpd since 2013. America is the only country to ever reach 12 million bpd of production. As output surges, U.S. oil stocks are also rising. U.S. commercial crude oil inventories <C-STK-T-EIA> rose by 3.7 million barrels to 454.5 million barrels in the week ended Feb. 15, the EIA said. Analysts say U.S. output will rise further and that oil firms will export more oil to sell off surplus stocks. ""We see total U.S. crude production hitting 13 million bpd by year-end, with 2019 averaging 12.5 million bpd,"" U.S. bank Citi said following the release of the EIA report. Of that, the bank said, ""we could be seeing some weeks with 4.6 million bpd of gross crude exports by end-year, adding to this week's new record"" of 3.6 million bpd. Friday's dips at least temporarily halted a rally that pushed crude prices this week to their highest for 2019 so far amid the supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). OPEC and some non-affiliated producers such as Russia agreed late last year to cut output by 1.2 million bpd to prevent a large supply overhang from growing. Another recent price driver has been U.S. sanctions against oil exporters Iran and Venezuela.

2019-02-21,"NEW YORK, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Oil prices sank below recent 2019 highs as U.S. government data on Thursday showed a sharp build in crude stocks and record production, while concerns about slowing global economic growth weighed on the market. Supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, and oil sanctions on Venezuela and Iran helped to limit losses. Progress in U.S.-China talks to resolve a trade dispute that has dampened global economic growth also supported prices. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures fell 20 cents to settle at $56.96 a barrel after touching a 2019 high of $57.55 the previous day. Brent crude futures fell 1 cent to settle at $67.07 after hitting a 2019 peak on Wednesday at $67.38. U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose for a fifth straight week to the highest in more than a year, as production hit a record high and seasonal maintenance kept refining rates low last week, the Energy Information Administration said. U.S. crude stocks rose 3.7 million barrels in the week to Feb. 15, to 454.5 million barrels, the highest since October 2017, even as crude exports surged 1.2 million barrels per day to a record 3.6 million bpd. Crude inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery site for U.S. crude futures, accounted for 3.4 million barrels of the rise. ""The overall headline number on inventories were higher than expected, and most of that build though was coming from Cushing, Oklahoma,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. ""In fact, if it weren't for Cushing, Oklahoma, it would be a modest build in line with expectation."" Production in the United States, which last year became the world's top crude producer, rose to record high at 12 million bpd. Still, tightening supply globally helped keep losses at bay. Oil prices have been driven up this year after OPEC and producer allies, known as OPEC+, agreed to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) to prevent a supply overhang from growing. Nigeria said on Wednesday it was prepared to reduce its oil output after supplies from the OPEC member rose in January. U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran have hit crude exports while unrest has curbed Libyan output, further tightening supply. Washington and Beijing have started to outline commitments in principle on the stickiest points in their trade tariff dispute, sources familiar with the negotiations told Reuters. Analysts said that ongoing signs of a global economic slowdown were also preventing prices from surging beyond highs reached earlier this week.

2019-02-21,"The United States exported a record amount of crude oil last week, as output from the nation's shale fields continues to surge.  The nation shipped out just over 3.6 million barrels a day in the week through Feb. 15, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That easily topped the previous all-time high of 3.2 million bpd set in November. Also last week, U.S. production hit a record 12 million bpd. The reading is subject to significant revision, but this is the first time EIA's weekly report has shown American output hitting the threshold. The weekly reading has been hovering at 11.9 million bpd for the last five weeks. Much of that growing output is coming from U.S. shale fields, where drillers use advanced methods to squeeze crude oil and natural gas from rock formations. On Tuesday, EIA forecast output from seven major U.S. shale fields will rise by 84,000 bpd next month to 8.4 million bpd. The U.S. notched the new export record despite China halting imports of American crude in recent months amid a trade dispute with Washington. China had emerged as the biggest buyer of U.S. oil prior to that. Shipping data indicates that China was scheduled to receive its first cargoes of crude oil from the U.S. in months around Feb. 17, but it was not immediately clear if those shipments were baked into last week's figures. To be sure, weekly U.S. exports rise and fall by wide margins from week to week.  The U.S. will start consistently exporting more crude oil and petroleum products than it imports at the end of next year, EIA recently forecast.
