2019-02-05,"Saudi Arabia and a group of OPEC members are reportedly trying to commit Russia and other oil-producing nations to continue managing supply for up to three more years. The so-called OPEC+ coalition reached a historic deal in 2016 to slash output in a bid to end a punishing oil price downturn. The group of two dozen producers briefly lifted the caps last year, but agreed to fresh production cuts in December after a three-month collapse in oil prices. OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo and some oil ministers have long sought to make the alliance permanent, but Russia essentially nixed that idea in December. Now, some OPEC nations including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are trying to lock their allies into another several years of coordination, the Wall Street Journal reports. Some of the nations are expected to debate the proposal when they meet in Vienna later this month, according to the Journal. ""It is an effort to put a formal framework around an ad hoc relationship,"" Helima Croft, global head of commodities strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC. She said OPEC clearly does not want Russia to abandon them. An OPEC spokesperson was not immediately available to comment. One OPEC official told the Journal the prospect of another price crash is pushing coalition members to agree on some sort of arrangement. A vow to continue cooperation would support oil markets because it would reassure traders the OPEC+ backstop would remain in place. Brent crude has rebounded about $12 a barrel to about $62 a barrel after tumbling 42 percent, but the international benchmark is struggling to break through resistance around $65 a barrel.  Moscow is better positioned to balance its budget at current levels than Saudi Arabia, which needs Brent prices at about $73 a barrel to break even, according to the International Monetary Fund. However, the new proposal is likely to face opposition from within the coalition. Iran in particular opposes steps towards institutionalizing the alliance, OPEC sources tell the Journal. The Islamic Republic worries that would concentrate decision-making in the hands of Moscow and Riyadh, its chief regional rival. Russia and Saudi Arabia are the second and third biggest oil producers, respectively. In recent years, a smaller group within the coalition tasked with monitoring compliance to production quotas — the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee — has increasingly dominated the conversation. The Journal reports that Iran and non-OPEC member Oman have sought to reduce the number of JMMC meetings. Other OPEC members including Algeria, Angola, Iraq and Nigeria have also pushed back on the idea of a permanent coalition that gives the Saudis and Russians more influence, according to the Journal. In December, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak poured cold water on the idea. ""There is a consensus that there will be no such organization. That's because it requires additional bureaucratic brouhaha,"" Novak said, noting bipartisan U.S. legislation aimed at breaking up OPEC. NOPEC, or the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, would authorize the Justice Department to sue groups like OPEC that are deemed cartels for price fixing and antitrust violations, stripping countries of sovereign immunity protections currently built into U.S. law.

2019-02-05,"NEW YORK, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped on Tuesday, falling from two-month highs as concerns over a global economic slowdown crept back into the market, and a stronger dollar also weighed. Prices sagged after a survey showed euro zone business expansion nearly stalled in January. That, coupled with disappointing U.S. factory orders data a day earlier, stoked worries about softer demand, analysts said. Brent crude futures fell 53 cents to settle at $61.98 a barrel. They touched their highest level in more than two months at $63.63 the previous day. U.S. crude futures dropped 90 cents to settle at $53.66 a barrel, or down 1.7 percent. Futures held lower after the close, when the American Petroleum Institute said U.S. crude stocks rose by 2.5 million barrels last week, more than analyst expectations. Oil also felt pressure from a strengthening dollar, which rallied for a fourth straight session, which makes crude more expensive for non-U.S. buyers. ""It really seemed to be a dollar influence here today,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management. ""It was interesting that we didn't catch a bid along with the stock market because that had been the correlation."" Investors were shifting assets into equities and away from markets more sensitive to Washington-Beijing trade relations and movements in the dollar, said Phillip Streible, senior commodities strategist at RJO Futures. ""Oil is just not in favor today, and they are going after the equity markets,"" he said. Wall Street was slightly higher on Tuesday. U.S. sanctions on Venezuela have been viewed as supportive of prices by helping tighten global supplies. Numerous tankers are currently in the water off the Venezuelan coast, unable to move because state-owned PDVSA is demanding payment, which would run afoul of U.S. sanctions. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, agreed to production cuts effective from last month to beat back supply growth. A Reuters survey found that supply from OPEC states had fallen the most in two years. Concerns about the pace of global economic growth were fanned by a weak start for the year for euro zone businesses. A Tuesday survey showed demand declined for the first in over four years. New orders for U.S.-made goods fell unexpectedly in November, according to data released a day earlier.

2019-02-05,"NEW YORK, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Tuesday, pulling back from two-month highs as concerns over a global economic slowdown crept back into the market and a stronger dollar also weighed. Prices sagged a day after the release of weak U.S. factory order data, which, coupled with recent disappointing economic data out of China, stoked worries about softer demand for crude oil in 2019, analysts said.

2019-02-05,"Exxon Mobil and Qatar Petroleum on Tuesday announced a final decision to finance a $10 billion-plus project to export liquefied natural gas from the Texas Gulf Coast. The decision moves forward the latest export terminal fueling growing shipments of U.S. LNG, or natural gas cooled to liquid form, for overseas travel. The Department of Energy last month forecast that LNG will play a major role in the U.S. exporting more energy than it imports by 2020, a feat the nation has not achieved in nearly 70 years. The plan to export LNG from Exxon's Golden Pass terminal speaks to the renaissance in U.S. energy production. The facility was originally built to import LNG, but the surge in U.S. natural gas production over the last decade means American drillers are now looking overseas for buyers. Exxon says work to retool the terminal near Port Arthur, Texas, along the Louisiana border will begin this quarter. The oil giant expects the facility to start up in 2024 and says it will ultimately be able to produce roughly 16 million tons of LNG each year.

2019-02-05,"During just six months crude oil prices ripped higher by about 20 percent, plunged more than 40 percent and snapped back 25 percent, an intense volatility that analysts warn could be the new normal in the oil market. December was a real nightmare for the global market, where the swings were $50 at a low, $86 at a high and $68 for the average of Brent crude oil. Brent was trading at about $62.44 per barrel in the futures market Tuesday, while Western Texas Intermediate was $54.25 per barrel. Booming U.S. oil production and the rise of the United States to become the world's largest producer has certainly factored in the shift away from OPEC as the main entity controlling supply and prices. In 2016, Saudi Arabia led other OPEC members to align with Russia and other producers to use their combined clout to manage global energy prices. Another factor new to the market is the active participation of President Donald Trump, who through tweets and comments has pressured both Saudi Arabia and OPEC to let up on production when prices are high. Trump has also moved to sanction two members of OPEC — Iran and Venezuela — impacting global oil supply. ""In this boom-bust era, as in prior ones, you can have a year or two of stability, but in general when you don't have an effective swing producer and you have big imbalances and geopolitical risk,"" there's volatility, said Robert McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group. ""I'm telling everybody, 'Buckle up.' That's the market we're in for the foreseeable future."" The Saudi-Russia alliance raised production last summer to help add oil to the market ahead of the Iran sanctions and amid concerns of a tight market. Russia and Saudi Arabia touted their joint effort, and their broader relationship was front and center last year when a smiling Russian President Vladimir Putin met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the sidelines of the World Cup. The new dominance of the United States in the oil market, combined with the Saudi-Russia alliance, means new tensions, and the industry will have to adjust. Oil supply also only looks set to increase with more U.S. output, as well as growing production from places like Brazil. The U.S. could also be in a position to send many more barrels out into the world, after infrastructure projects to transport crude from the Permian basin in Texas are completed later in the year. ""It certainly means we're going to be in a more volatile world when it comes to oil prices. I think it means more caution about long-cycle oil projects. I think that's an immediate impact,"" said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit. ""I think the oil price is moved by what happens with the overall financial markets. It means sentiment will have a bigger impact on the oil price. A big surge in U.S. oil production becomes bearish for the global market so you get more and more complicated feedback loops.""

2019-02-05,"(Adds quotes, details) KUWAIT, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The head of state-run Kuwait Petroleum Corp, Hashem Hashem, said on Tuesday that global oil supply could be hit this year by big reductions in exports from Venezuela. The Trump administration has imposed sweeping sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA, aimed at severely curbing the OPEC member's crude exports to the United States and at pressuring socialist President Nicolas Maduro to step down. ""One of the known risks of supply shortage in 2019 would include the continuing decline of Venezuelan crude oil production beyond current expectations,"" Hashem told an industry conference in Kuwait. ""However the wild card recently has been market perceptions of potential shortages mainly from geopolitical pressures that have caused supply disruptions in the past and therefore pose a real threat for 2019."" Hashem also said that the threat of a U.S.-China trade war and mixed messages from the United States on whether it would raise interest rates is causing volatility in the global equity markets and could increase oil price volatility this year. OPEC, Russia and other non-OPEC producers - an alliance known as OPEC+ - agreed in December to reduce supply by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from Jan. 1. OPEC's share of the cut is 800,000 bpd, to be delivered by 11 members - all except Iran, Libya and Venezuela. Hashem said OPEC+ actions should help re-balance the oil markets this year but he also warned of the impact of underinvestment in the oil industry which could cause a supply crunch by 2025. ""OPEC and the non-OPEC producing countries... have successfully provided stability to the market since 2017 and reduced volatility in oil prices. The resultant prices, are critical to stimulate investment and growth,"" he said.
