2019-01-22,"HOUSTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Crude prices tumbled more than 3 percent on Tuesday over concerns that China's slowing economy could curtail fuel demand worldwide as forecasters predicted weaker global growth amid the U.S.-China trade war. The International Monetary Fund on Monday warned the risk of a pronounced global slowdown has risen because of constrained international trade, and it trimmed its 2019 global growth forecast to 3.5 percent, from 3.7 percent in last October's outlook. ""That represents a lot of barrels if you apply that to the oil market,"" said Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York. ""The IMF report put the crude oil market on the back of it's foot, for sure."" Brent oil futures were down $1.95, or 3.1 percent, at $60.79 a barrel by 11 a.m. EST (1600 GMT). U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down $1.83, or 3.4 percent, at $51.97. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told reporters the slowing growth does not signal an impending recession, but said the risk of ""a sharper decline"" in global growth has increased. China reported the lowest annual economic growth in nearly 30 years on Monday and its state planner warned on Tuesday that falling factory orders point to a further drop in activity and more job losses. While China's oil imports hit a record above 10 million barrels per day (bpd) in late 2018, many analysts believe the country has reached peak energy growth, with its thirst set to wane. Singapore-based tanker brokerage Eastport said China's slowing manufacturing activity is likely weighing on demand, and that industrial slowdowns tend to be leading indicators that feed gradually into lower demand for shipped oil products. In a sign of spreading economic weakness, growth in South Korea's export-oriented economy slowed to a six-year low of 2.7 percent in 2018, official data showed. ""There's a lot of concern in the oil market about China's weaker economic data,"" said Phillip Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures. ""It's economic expansion is the weakest since 1990."" GROWING SUPPLY Crude prices this month have gained support from supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. However, data from Saudi Arabia on Monday showed its crude oil exports in November rose to 8.2 million bpd from 7.7 million in October. Market participants ""believe the U.S. can continue to pump pretty extensively,"" RJO's Streible added. The United States has topped Russia and Saudi Arabia as the largest producer in the world. Seventy percent of the senior energy industry executives plan to boost or maintain capital spending this year, compared with 39 percent in 2017, a survey by advisor DNV GL showed this week. ""Despite greater oil price volatility in recent months, our research shows that the sector appears confident in its ability to better cope with market instability and long-term lower oil and gas prices,"" said Liv Hovem, who heads DNV's oil and gas division.

2019-01-22,"BP is expecting solid growth in oil demand this year despite growing concerns about a global economic slowdown, CEO Bob Dudley said Tuesday. The British energy giant forecasts the world's appetite for oil will grow by another 1.4 million barrels per day in 2019. That compares with demand growth of 1.3 million bpd last year, according to the International Energy Agency, a policy advisor to developed nations. The 2019 projection puts BP's view in line with the latest forecast from the Paris-based IEA, but ahead of OPEC, which sees demand growing at a more tepid 1.29 million bpd. ""We're not actually seeing this worrying thought that it's all going to start falling,"" Dudley told CNBC in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Asked whether that view holds despite the IMF cutting its outlook for global economic growth on Tuesday, Dudley said, ""We certainly don't see it yet in the numbers.""

2019-01-22,"SINGAPORE, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Tuesday on signs that an economic slowdown in China, the world's second-largest economy and oil consumer, was spreading, stoking concerns over future fuel demand. The gloomy economic news has pulled down financial markets across Asia, including crude oil futures. International Brent oil futures were at $62.26 per barrel at 0736 GMT, down 48 cents, or 0.8 percent, from their previous close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $53.43 per barrel, down 0.7 percent, or 37 cents. China's state planner on Tuesday warned that the downward pressure on the economy will affect China's job market as falling factory orders point to a further drop in activity in coming months and more job shedding. On Monday, China reported its lowest annual economic growth since 1990. China's oil imports have so far defied the economic slowdown, hitting a record above 10 million barrels per day (bpd) in late 2018, but many analysts believe the country to be at peak energy growth, with its thirst set to wane as the slowdown bites. ""Slowing manufacturing activity in China is likely weighing on demand,"" said Singapore-based tanker brokerage Eastport, adding that industrial slowdowns tended to be leading indicators that fed gradually into lower demand for shipped oil products. In a sign of spreading economic weakness, South Korea's export-oriented economy slowed to a six-year low growth rate of 2.7 percent in 2018, official data showed on Tuesday. This came after the International Monetary Fund on Monday trimmed its 2019 global growth forecast to 3.5 percent, down from 3.7 percent in last October's outlook. There is a high correlation between economic growth and oil demand growth. ""This was the second downturn revision in three months, and we can still see further downgrades in near future if trade tensions escalate, the UK exits with a no-deal from the EU, or China's economic growth drops more sharply,"" said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at futures brokerage FXTM. Despite the darkening outlook, oil prices have been getting some support from supply cuts started in late 2018 by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). ""The effects of OPEC-led cuts ... will undoubtedly place a price floor under crude oil,"" said Singapore-based brokerage Phillip Futures on Tuesday.

2019-01-22,"Oil prices tumbled on Tuesday as China posted its weakest economic expansion in nearly three decades and the IMF revised its global growth forecast lower, raising fresh concerns about fuel demand. Crude futures and equities came under renewed pressure in afternoon trading after the Trump administration canceled a meeting with Chinese counterparts to advance trade negotiations.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures ended Tuesday's session down $1.23, or 2.3 percent, to $52.57. Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, dropped $1.20, or 1.9 percent, to $61.54 just before 2:30 p.m. ET. WTI earlier touched a fresh six-week high above $54 a barrel. Both WTI and Brent have posted three straight weeks of gains, rising 18 percent and 20 percent, respectively, through last Friday.  But futures gave back some of last week's gains on Tuesday as trading got back underway following the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday in the United States. The IMF on Tuesday cut its outlook for global economic growth in 2019 to 3.5 percent, down from an early forecast of 3.7 percent. ""It seems a distinct amount of economic concern is rising up, compounded by the IMF report that came out showing a downward revision to economic growth,"" said Matt Smith, head of commodity research at tanker-tracking firm ClipperData. Fears of a slowing global economy have stoked concern about faltering demand for fuel. The fears have largely been driven by an ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China, the world's two biggest economies and top oil consumers. The Trump administration has canceled a meeting among the U.S. Treasury Department, the United States Trade Representative and Chinese vice minister of finance scheduled for this week, a source told CNBC. The move came as progress on negotiations over intellectual property protections stalled and Washington sought a better deal from Beijing, the source said.

2019-01-22,"Executives in the U.S. oil and gas industry are said to be much more optimistic about growth in the sector, compared to last year. In its annual study, DNV GL, claimed that 85 percent of American executives questioned believed there were reasons to expect an increase in drilling in 2019. In the corresponding figure for 2018, the figure was 60 percent. U.S. oil and gas executives appeared to be more bullish than the global average of positive voices which DNV GL recorded at 76 percent.
