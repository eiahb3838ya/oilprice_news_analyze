2019-02-13,"SINGAPORE, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday, buoyed by hopes that potential progress in the latest Sino-U.S. tariff talks would improve the global economic outlook, and as China's trade figures including crude imports beat forecasts. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $54.16 per barrel at 0413 GMT, up 26 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures were up 37 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $63.98 a barrel. Optimism that a trade deal could be reached between the United States and China was boosted when U.S. President Donald Trump said talks were going ""very well"". ""The 90-day truce (on trade) agreed in December will run out on March 1, but given the progress of the talks there could be an extension, which is why there (is) rising optimism that the two leaders will meet later that month,"" said Alfonso Esparza, senior market analyst, OANDA. Markets were also supported by upbeat Chinese trade data, including for crude oil. China's crude oil imports in January rose 4.8 percent from a year earlier, customs data showed on Thursday, to an average of 10.03 million barrels per day (bpd), the third straight month that imports have exceeded the 10 million bpd mark. Not all data pointed to tighter market conditions and higher prices. Climbing U.S. oil stockpiles weighed on prices. U.S. crude oil inventories rose last week to the highest since November 2017 as refiners cut runs to the lowest since October 2017, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude inventories built for a fourth week in a row, rising 3.6 million barrels to 450.8 million barrels in the week to Feb. 8. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast an increase of 2.7 million barrels. U.S. crude oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA> remained at a record of 11.9 million barrels per day (bpd). The global oil market will struggle this year to absorb fast-growing crude supply from outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), even with the group's production cuts and U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran, the International Energy Agency said in a report on Wednesday. The IEA said it expected global oil demand this year to grow by 1.4 million bpd, while non-OPEC supply will grow by 1.8 million bpd.

2019-02-13,"MELBOURNE, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Australia's Woodside Petroleum Ltd surprised investors with a fat dividend on Thursday after reporting a 36-percent percent rise in annual profit, underpinned by stronger oil prices. The higher-than-expected payout came after shareholders stumped up $2.5 billion to buy new shares a year ago at a time when Australia's biggest independent oil and gas producer expected oil prices to average $65 a barrel. By the end of the year it was flush with cash as oil prices had averaged $71 and the Wheatstone liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, run by Chevron Corp and partly owned by Woodside, performed better than anticipated. ""We thought it was prudent to reward our shareholders for supporting us last year in the equity raising, given that pricing and production has been stronger than we expected when we raised that equity,"" Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman told reporters on a conference call. Woodside's shares rose as much as 3.4 percent in a broader market that was up 0.4 percent. ""The dividend was the big surprise, a second-half payout ratio of about 100 percent,"" RBC analyst Ben Wilson said in a note. ""The increased dividend will be welcomed by some, particularly given the strong appetite for cash-flow generation and higher distribution from investors in energy companies globally, driven by increased oil price volatility,"" Wilson said. The total dividend was $852 million, or 144 cents a share, compared with analysts' forecasts of around 135 cents a share, according to Refinitiv estimates. Net profit for 2018 rose to $1.36 billion from $1.07 billion in 2017. Underlying profit was $1.42 billion, just below analysts' estimates of around $1.45 billion. With an eye on growth, Woodside in January pledged between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion towards projects this year, with most of that flowing into early work on its Scarborough and Browse gas developments and expansion of its Pluto LNG plant in Australia, as the company aims to double LNG production by 2027. The capital raising last year was partly to help Woodside buy a 50-percent stake in Scarborough for $744 million, giving it a total stake of 75 percent. It is now looking to sell part of that by the end of this year, fielding interest from a number of international parties, Coleman said. He did not name the companies. There is speculation Saudi Aramco is one of them, after Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih said in an interview with the Financial Times this week the world's biggest oil producer was looking at investments offshore, including Australia. ""Woodside as a company, and Australia as a country, could be perceived as a more manageable investment destination for Saudi Aramco's global LNG ambitions compared to some other pre-FID (final investment decision) projects,"" said Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic.

2019-02-13,"NEW YORK, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose almost 2 percent on Wednesday after top exporter Saudi Arabia said it would cut crude exports and deliver an even deeper cut to its production, but swelling U.S. crude inventories limited the day's gains. U.S. crude oil inventories rose last week to the highest since November 2017 as refiners cut runs to the lowest since October 2017, the Energy Information Administration said. The increase came despite falling net imports, which dropped to the lowest on record, as domestic crude production remained at peak levels for the fifth straight week. Brent crude futures settled up $1.19, or 1.9 percent, at $63.61 a barrel. The global benchmark touched a session high of $63.98, but pulled back after the EIA data was released. U.S. crude futures settled up 80 cents, or 1.5 percent, at $53.90 a barrel, after touching $54.60 earlier in the session. ""This report is bearish,"" said Phil Flynn an oil analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. ""The market is holding up because of the outside markets, the hope for a trade deal, and a strong Dow,"" he said. Still the somewhat bearish report did little to shake the market's overwhelmingly bullish sentiment, said Tom Saal, senior vice president at INTL FCStone in Miami. ""It's a little bit on the bearish side,"" Saal said. ""But the news about Saudi Arabia is pretty significant, so the market is reacting to that more so than anything else right now."" On Tuesday, Saudi Energy minister Khalid al-Falih told the Financial Times the kingdom's production will fall below 10 million barrels per day in March, more than half a million below the target it agreed to in a deal between OPEC and its allies, aimed at curbing a global supply overhang. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said on Tuesday it had cut output by almost 800,000 bpd in January to 30.81 million bpd. Saudi Arabia is responsible for most of that reduction. ""The feel-good factor is back in play but oil bulls are by no means out of the woods yet,"" PVM Oil Associates Stephen Brennock said. ""It is a well-known fact that the world economy is losing momentum amid a plethora of downside risks including lingering U.S.-China trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainty."" U.S. restrictions on Venezuela's energy sector should remove some 330,000 bpd in supply this year, according to Goldman Sachs. The oil price has risen by 20 percent so far this year, yet most of that increase came in early January, before the imposition of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela's energy sector. The global oil market remains well supplied, the International Energy Agency said in its monthly market report on Wednesday, and output should still outstrip demand this year. ""Oil prices have not increased alarmingly because the market is still working off the surpluses built up in the second half of 2018,"" the IEA said. ""In quantity terms, in 2019, the U.S. alone will grow its crude oil production by more than Venezuela's current output. In quality terms, it is more complicated. Quality matters."" U.S. crude output is expected to grow by 1.45 million bpd this year and by another 790,000 bpd next year to hit 13 million bpd in 2020, according to the EIA The growth, led by U.S. shale oil output, has built up global inventories of crude and refined products.

The increase came despite falling net imports, which dropped to the lowest on record, as domestic crude production remained at peak levels for the fifth straight week. Crude inventories built for a fourth week in a row, rising 3.6 million barrels to 450.8 million barrels in the week to Feb. 8. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast an increase of 2.7 million barrels. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures fell by just over 1 million barrels, EIA said. Oil futures pared gains after the data was released, but remained higher on the day. U.S. crude was up 97 cents a barrel at $54.07 by 11:18 a.m. EST (1618 GMT) and Brent crude was up $1.01 at $63.42 a barrel. ""This was a unique report,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management. ""The rise in crude oil inventories came despite a plunge in crude oil imports,"" he said. At the same time, product inventories increased due to falling demand, even though refinery runs were down, he said. Net U.S. crude imports fell last week by 430,000 barrels per day to 3.8 million bpd, the lowest on record, based on EIA data going back to 2001. Crude production, however, has held at peak levels at 11.9 million bpd since early January. Refinery crude runs fell 865,000 bpd to 15.8 million bpd as utilization rates slumped 4.8 percentage points to 85.9 percent of total capacity, the lowest levels since October, 2017, EIA data showed. Gasoline stocks rose by 408,000 barrels, compared with analysts' expectations for a 826,000-barrel gain.

2019-02-13,"Energy market participants may be able to adjust to U.S. sanctions against Venezuela's crude industry, the IEA said in its closely-watched report on Tuesday. The report comes at a time when tensions in Venezuela are reaching boiling point, with the oil-rich, but cash-poor, country in the midst of the Western Hemisphere's worst humanitarian crisis in recent memory. President Donald Trump's administration imposed targeted crude sanctions on Caracas late last month. The surprise move was designed to bar President Nicolas Maduro's access to oil revenue that has helped his embattled administration remain in power. ""The imposition of sanctions by the United States against Venezuela's state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) is another reminder of the huge importance for oil of political events,"" the Paris-based IEA said Tuesday.
