2019-01-29,"NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose more than 2 percent on Tuesday after the United States imposed sanctions on state-owned Venezuelan oil company PDVSA, a move likely to curb the OPEC member's crude exports and temper concerns about global oversupply that have weighed on crude futures. International Brent crude oil futures were up $1.42 to $61.35 a barrel, or 2.4 percent, by 11:38 a.m. EST (1638 GMT). U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up $1.37 to $53.36 a barrel, or 2.6 percent. ""The Venezuelan situation is obviously supportive,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. ""I don't think there's a fear in the market that it's going to be a devastating blow to the supply side, but it's just another piece to the supply puzzle that's going to be missing."" Venezuela is among the world's largest heavy crude oil producers, and the United States has been its biggest client, taking about half the country's export volumes, followed by India and China.. While Washington's sanctions stop short of banning U.S. companies from buying oil from the Latin American country, proceeds from such sales will be put in a ""blocked account"" that should deter PDVSA from shipping crude to the United States. Venezuela's exports have already fallen to little more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 from 1.6 million bpd in 2017, according to Refinitiv ship-tracking data and trade sources. Petromatrix estimated that Venezuelan exports will drop by about 500,000 barrels per day under current conditions. Additionally, Venezuela is a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which is implementing a supply cut deal to support prices. Russia, OPEC's biggest non-member ally, denounced the sanctions, saying they would likely limit Venezuela's ability to service its $3.15 billion sovereign debt to Moscow. Meanwhile, Libya's biggest oilfield, El Sharara, will remain shut until departure of an armed group occupying the site, the head of National Oil Corp said. Global oil supply remains high, largely because of a more than 2 million bpd increase in U.S. crude oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA> last year to a record 11.9 million bpd. Some in the oil industry also worry that crude demand could stutter if the trade war between Washington and Beijing slows global economic growth. In China, a top oil importer, signs of a slowdown have emerged. Activity in its vast manufacturing sector is expected to shrink for the second straight month in January, a Reuters poll showed. Caterpillar and Nvidia issued warnings on Monday about weakening demand from China.

2019-01-29,"TORONTO, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar was little changed against its U.S. counterpart on Tuesday as higher oil prices offset increased uncertainty over trade talks this week between the United States and China. U.S. officials announced criminal charges against China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd that could upset the  U.S.-China talks, which are part of negotiations intended to walk back trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. Canada is running a current account deficit and exports many commodities, including oil, so its economy could be hurt by a reduction in the global flow of trade or capital. The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, rose after Washington imposed sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA in a move that may curb the OPEC member's crude exports. U.S. crude oil futures were up 2.8 percent at $53.42 a  barrel. At 9:44 a.m. (1444 GMT), the Canadian dollar was  trading nearly unchanged at 1.3259 to the greenback, or 75.42 U.S. cents. The currency, which on Monday touched its strongest intraday in more than two weeks at 1.3204, traded in a range of 1.3246 to 1.3278. The steady profile for the loonie came as foreign exchange traders awaited crucial parliamentary votes in Britain later in the day that are aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock. The currency market could also take its cue this week from Wednesday's interest rate decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The Fed is expected to acknowledge growing risks to the U.S. economy as global momentum weakens. Canadian government bond prices edged lower across the yield curve, with the two-year price down 1 Canadian cent to yield 1.879 percent and the 10-year falling 2  Canadian cents to yield 1.966 percent. Canada's gross domestic product data for November is due on Thursday.

2019-01-29,"LONDON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Tuesday after Washington imposed sanctions on state-owned Venezuelan oil company PDVSA in a move likely to curb the OPEC member's crude exports, but gains were capped by abundant supply and signs of a slowing Chinese economy. The upward momentum in the global benchmarks gathered pace in afternoon trading. International Brent crude oil futures were up $1.31 at $61.24 a barrel by 1438 GMT and on track for its biggest monthly rise since April 2016. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up $1.32 at $53.31. Venezuela has the world's biggest proven oil reserves, but its potential has not been realised fully because of a lack of investment. The country is also a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which is implementing a supply cut deal to shore up prices. ""The Latin American country is predominantly the producer of heavier crude, exactly what (U.S. Gulf) refiners are thirsty for,"" PVM said in a note. ""They will now have to turn elsewhere (possibly to Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Iraq) to satisfy their needs for this type of crude, which would inevitably lead to a price spike."" Venezuela's exports fell to little more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 from 1.6 million bpd in 2017, according to Refinitiv ship-tracking data and trade sources. The United States has been the biggest buyer of Venezuelan oil despite their political differences, taking about half of the country's export volumes, followed by India and China. Petromatrix estimated that Venezuelan exports will drop by about 500,000 barrels per day under current conditions. Meanwhile, Libya's biggest oilfield, El Sharara, will remain shut until departure of an armed group occupying the site, the head of National Oil Corp said.

2019-01-29,"Russia and China strongly criticized U.S. sanctions placed on Venezuela, with the former pledging to support the beleaguered President Nicolas Maduro. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Tuesday the sanctions completely undermined confidence in a international financial system that is dominated by the U.S., Russian news agency Interfax reported. ""Russia is doing everything to support the lawful government of Maduro,"" Lavrov added, calling U.S. sanctions against Venezuelan state energy firm PDVSA ""cynical."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov added that the restrictions continue an ""undisguised interference in its (Venezuela's) internal affairs,"" calling them ""illegal."" The U.S. administration announced sanctions against the state's dominant energy firm PDVSA on Monday in a bid to damage the socialist dictator, President Nicolas Maduro, who is clinging to power amid a leadership battle. Last week, the opposition leader of Venezuela's National Assembly, Juan Guaido, named himself interim president after street protests against Maduro. The U.S. recognized that claim and has been encouraging support for regime change in Venezuela, a country hit by the economic policies of Maduro.

2019-01-29,"(Repeats Jan. 25 story; no changes to text) Jan 25 (Reuters) - Venezuela's oil exports to the United States remain the primary cash resource for its state-owned oil company, and efforts by the United States to cut off that revenue would likely force it to send crude to China, India or other Asian countries. U.S. refineries that depend on Venezuela's heavy crude would have even more trouble securing supplies as Canadian and Mexican crude are often not as discounted and are limited in availability. The United States has considered moves to cripple Venezuela's oil shipments, which account for nearly all of the country's exports, in response to the reelection of socialist President Nicolas Maduro, a vote that was widely viewed as a sham. However, it has not yet taken that step, nor has it elected to cut off supply of U.S. oil that goes to Mexico. Washington has recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's head of state. Guaido is considering naming a board to state-run PDVSA's U.S. subsidiary, Citgo Petroleum, in a gambit to generate revenue for the opposition. Venezuela, on average, exported about 500,000 barrels of crude a day to the United States in 2018, according to U.S. Energy Department data. The U.S. share of its exports has declined in recent years, with more shipments going to Russia and China. 1/8GRAPHIC: Venezuelan crude exports to the United States: https://tmsnrt.rs/2S4YIXB 3/8 Those deliveries are being made largely through oil-for-debt repayment structures as output from Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., known as PDVSA, has slumped to near 70-year lows during a nationwide economic crisis. Venezuela's output has been cut in half since 2016 to less than 1.2 million bpd, according to figures from OPEC secondary sources. Shipments to the United States account for about 75 percent of the cash Venezuela gets for crude shipments, according to a Barclays research note published last week. The primary importers of Venezuelan crude are Citgo, Valero Energy, and Chevron. The country could seek additional deals with Turkey, India or other Asian nations. Gas Energy, a Caracas-based consultancy, said in a report that India was the second-largest importer of Venezuelan crude in November. ""While Venezuela will be hard hit the first month, they will find some market for their crude,"" said Diego Moya Ocampos, principal Americas analyst in country risk at IHS Markit. 1/8GRAPHIC: Top U.S. importers of Venezuelan crude: https://tmsnrt.rs/2RYGk2E 3/8 Though the United States produces nearly 12 million barrels of oil a day, complex Gulf Coast refineries need heavier crude grades to produce diesel and other high-margin products, and cannot simply sub in light crude. Prices of heavier U.S. grades like Mars Sour <WTC-MRS>, an offshore medium U.S. crude, and Heavy Louisiana Sweet crude <WTC-HLS> have risen as buyers scramble for supply. Mars traded at a $7.10 premium to U.S. crude on Thursday, a five-year high, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, as bidders came into the market to secure supplies through the second quarter, traders said. ""It would make a tight market even tighter. If it happens, it would be an unambiguous headwind for refiners already struggling to find supplies,"" said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, an energy consultancy in Bethesda, Maryland. 1/8GRAPHIC: Venezuelan crude exports to U.S. refiners: https://tmsnrt.rs/2S42EI5. 3/8 Traders said the United States may need to sell oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to cover supply shortfalls as additional shipments are secured via Canada or Mexico. Sanctions could also include U.S. exports of petroleum products to Venezuela that are used for blending with Venezuelan heavy crude.

2019-01-29,"Gas reserves in the Middle East can create opportunities for employment, business and peacemaking, according to Egypt's petroleum minister. Amid a push by Egypt to transform itself into a regional gas hub, the country hosted the East Med Gas Hub earlier in January and gathered officials from Israel, Cyprus, Greece, Jordan, Italy and Palestine. Speaking Monday at the BHGE Annual Meeting in Florence, Italy, Egypt Petroleum Minister Tarek El-Molla told CNBC that the commodity can aid the peace process in the region. ""We were very proud to host the Palestinians the Israelis, sitting together in one room, on the roundtable together with other neighboring countries like Greece, Cyprus, Jordan and Italy,"" he told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick. ""So the benefit will be there and the welfare will cover all the countries because gas will be the cause of the revenues to generate opportunities, job opportunities, business opportunities and it will bless all the people there (in the Middle East) hence it is the catalyst and it will be the peacemaker really,"" he added.

2019-01-29,"U.S. sanctions on Venezuela's state-owned oil firm will force the country to sell its energy products at steep discounts to buyers such as China and India, experts said. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration announced sanctions against Venezuela's state-owned energy company Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA. The move ""will meaningfully dent the (Venezuelan) government's cashflow,"" wrote Risa Grais-Targow, Latin America director at Eurasia Group, a political consultancy. ""PDVSA will have to deeply discount its barrels in order to displace the heavy Middle Eastern crudes that those refineries are currently processing. This will also carry extra transportation costs,"" she added. Washington's sanctions are aimed at putting pressure on socialist leader Nicolas Maduro to step aside. Venezuela was thrust into a political crisis last Wednesday, when opposition leader Juan Guaido declared himself the rightful interim president, prompting world powers including Washington and many Latin American nations to recognize him as the country's ""acting president."" The move spurred Maduro to break relations with the U.S. and order all American diplomatic personnel to leave the country. The latest sanctions will transfer control of Venezuela's oil wealth to forces that oppose Maduro and deprive the strongman of resources that could prolong his grip on power.

2019-01-29,"Oil prices rebounded on Tuesday from steep losses in the previous session after Washington imposed sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA in a move that may curb the country's crude exports. Despite the move, which comes as the U.S government looks to pile pressure on President Nicolas Maduro to step down, traders said ample global oil supply and an economic slowdown, especially in China, were keeping crude prices in check.
