2018-12-27,"SEOUL, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped as much as 3 percent on Friday to win back a chunk of the ground they lost in the previous session, but growth in U.S. crude stockpiles and ongoing concerns about the global economy kept markets under pressure. Brent crude was up $1.18, or 2.26 percent, at $53.34 a barrel at 0219 GMT, having earlier risen as much as 3.1 percent. It dropped 4.24 percent, or $2.31, the day before to settle at $52.16 per barrel.

2018-12-27,"NEW YORK, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday, retreating from an 8 percent rally in the previous session as the oil market focused on signs of faltering global economic growth and record production of crude. Brent crude futures dropped 4.24 percent, or $2.31, to settle at $52.16 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell $1.61 to settle at $44.61 a barrel, down 3.48 percent. ""The market is giving back some of its gains from yesterday that were brought along with the euphoria in the stock market,"" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. Prices surged on Wednesday, tracking a spike on Wall Street after President Donald Trump's administration attempted to shore up investor confidence. U.S. stocks retreated for most of the session on Thursday, dragging oil prices, before roaring back to end in positive territory. Brent and WTI have lost more than a third of their value since the beginning of October and are heading for declines of more than 20 percent in 2018. Concerns about slowing global economic growth have dampened investor demand for riskier asset classes and pressured crude futures. Market participants are also worried about a glut of crude. U.S. crude stocks rose by 6.9 million barrels in the week ended Dec. 21 to 448.2 million, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed on Thursday. Analysts had expected a decrease of 2.9 million barrels. Official U.S. government data will be released on Friday. Three months ago it looked as if the global oil market would be undersupplied through the northern hemisphere winter as U.S. sanctions removed large volumes of Iranian crude. But other oil exporters have compensated for any shortfall, depressing prices. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, along with Russia and other producers, agreed this month to reduce output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), equivalent to more than 1 percent of global consumption. But the cuts will not take effect until January and oil production has been at or near record highs in Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States, now the world's top crude producer pumping 11.6 million bpd. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said the country will cut its output by between 3 million and 5 million tonnes in the first half of 2019. It then will be able to restore it to 556 million tonnes (11.12 million barrels per day) for the whole 2019, on par with 2018, he added. Although U.S. sanctions have put a cap on Iran's oil sales, Tehran has said its private exporters have ""no problems"" selling its oil.

2018-12-27,"Shares of certain U.S. energy producers are becoming increasingly attractive investments as oil prices fall along with the broader market, Seaport Global's Mike Kelly told CNBC on Thursday. Large swaths of the oil sector have been pummeled as concerns about a supply glut and global economic pressures have weighed on energy-related equities. Kelly, who leads Seaport's energy exploration and production research team, suggested that the declines are largely tied to the market's volatility in the last several months. ""Energy is so tied right now to the overall health of the economy,"" he said as oil prices slid Thursday after rallying 8 percent in Wednesday's trading session. ""The fear right now is that demand is going to fall off a cliff."" Wednesday's historic surge, he added, ""took oil up with it, simple as that."" Even so, some well-positioned U.S. fracking stocks are starting to look like bargains in the wake of lower oil prices, Kelly said on ""Power Lunch."" ""One I always come back to"" is Diamondback Energy whenever the stock falls under $90 a share, he said. Shares of the independent oil and gas producer fell as low as $88.47 in Thursday's trading session before reversing to gain 0.97 percent into the close. The stock is down nearly 27 percent year to date. Even if oil fell to $15 a barrel from its current $45 level, Diamondback would be ""the last E&P standing here,"" Kelly said. ""The low-cost producer ultimately wins in this sector, and that's Diamondback."" At the same time, Kelly said, U.S. oil producers such as Diamondback and PDC Energy, another one of his stock picks, were responsible for oil's collapse in 2018. They ""are the reason we're at $45 oil right now,"" the analyst said, but mainly because of ""how good they've gotten at taking oil out of the ground."" For longer-term investors, Kelly noted that oilfield service companies, particularly Halliburton and Schlumberger, ""look very, very compelling right now"" despite some concerning short-term data points, such as tapering U.S. growth or oversupply. ""Longer-term they do look like very, very compelling values,"" the analyst said. Halliburton and Schlumberger both sank in Thursday's trading session, losing 0.26 and 0.76 percent, respectively, after rebounding from their intraday lows. Both stocks are down more than 46 percent for 2018.

2018-12-27,"Investors hoping for serenity in the New Year should probably avoid the oil market. Energy analysts say the volatility gripping the sector is likely to continue beyond the holidays. The oil price moves this week have been spectacular even for a market that has seen the cost of crude spike to nearly four-year highs in early October and lose almost half of its value by late December. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude plunged to an 18-month low at $42.53 on Monday, shedding more than $7 a barrel in just five days. On Wednesday, the contract rallied nearly 9 percent to $46.22, posting its best daily performance in more than two years. By Thursday, U.S. crude was once again deteriorating, slipping 3.5 percent and falling back below $45 a barrel.  To be sure, the wild swings can be explained in part by thin trading during the week of Christmas. Tamar Essner, director of energy and utilities at Nasdaq Corporate Solutions said ""the low liquidity during the holiday week is exaggerating the volatility and causing irrational price action as the market has no confidence about anything now."" However, investors may have to endure the roller coaster ride even after traders return to their desks, according to Dominic Schnider, head of commodity and Asia-Pacific forex at UBS. ""I think the volatility in the short term is here definitely because we need some confirmation"" that prices will rise, ""and that confirmation ultimately comes from inventory in the U.S. going down further,"" Schnider told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" in Asia. Stockpiles of crude held in the United States began building up in September. They now sit about 7 percent above the five-year average for inventory levels. Stocks began ticking lower four weeks ago, but the oil market needs to see a stronger downtrend before it rallies, says Schnider. ""Once we get that confirmation somewhere in the first quarter I think the volatility in the oil market should come down, and that's why it's the time to position towards higher prices"" he said.
