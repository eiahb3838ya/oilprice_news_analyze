2019-01-02,"investors@ SINGAPORE, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday amid volatile currency and stock markets, and as analysts warned of an economic slowdown for 2019 just as crude supply is rising globally. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures dropped by around 2 percent from their last settlement, or 93 cents, to $45.61 by 0404 GMT. International Brent crude futures were down 1.1 percent, or 60 cents, at $54.31 a barrel. In physical oil markets, top exporter Saudi Arabia is expected to cut February prices for heavier crude grades sold to Asia by up to 50 cents a barrel due to weaker fuel oil margins, respondents to a Reuters survey said on Thursday. Markets were roiled by a more than 3 percent slump of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen overnight, and after tech giant Apple cut its sales forecast. ""We did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China,"" Apple chief executive Tim Cook said. The slowdown in China and turmoil in stock and currency markets is making investors nervous, including in oil markets. Investment bank Jefferies said in a 2019 opening note to clients and employees that the start of the year ""doesn't feel as firm, the future doesn't feel as certain and optimistic, and the path forward does not seem as clear."" The U.S. bank added that ""markets are extremely volatile and virtually impossible to anticipate or navigate."" Shipping brokerage Eastport said the turmoil in markets is scaring off investors. ""Falling share prices tend to damage consumer sentiment, which often results in increased caution and reduced spending...Business managers also tend to limit capex, thus weighing on investment as well."" SUPPLY SURGE Oil markets have also come under pressure from a surge in supply. U.S. crude production stood at a record 11.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in late 2018, making the United States the world's biggest oil producer. Others are not sitting idle, with Russian output reaching a record of more than 11 million bpd in 2018. Supply from Iraq, the number two producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) behind Saudi Arabia, is also up, with December exports at 3.73 million bpd, up from 3.37 million bpd in November. With production rising and demand growth expected to slow, many analysts expect a global oil supply overhang to build in the first months of 2019.

2019-01-02,"NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose about 2 percent in choppy trading on Wednesday, supported by a slight recovery on Wall Street, even as concerns remained about weakening global economic growth which could hurt demand for oil. Brent crude futures gained $1.11, or 2.1 percent, to settle at $54.91 a barrel, after trading between $52.51 and $56.56. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude ended $1.13, or 2.5 percent, higher at $46.54 a barrel, after hitting a session low at $44.35 and high at $47.78. Oil futures were buoyed by U.S. equity markets as major stock indices pared earlier losses. Crude futures have recently tracked stocks on Wall Street, which in 2018 recorded its worst year in a decade. However, manufacturing data from China earlier added to ongoing concerns about a slowing global economy and increased output out of countries like Russia. China's factory activity contracted for the first time in more than two years in December, highlighting the challenges facing Beijing as it seeks to end a bruising trade war with Washington. ""We still view some slippage in the Chinese economy as a significant bearish consideration given the fact that they had become the largest crude importer in the world,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note Euro zone manufacturing data also proved disappointing, as activity barely expanded at the end of 2018, according to a survey. Worries about an economic slowdown and excess supply dragged down oil prices from multi-year highs reached in October 2018. Crude futures ended 2018 down for the first year since 2015, with WTI slumping 25 percent and Brent tumbling 21 percent. Russian production hit a post-Soviet record in 2018, figures showed on Wednesday. Other data showed U.S. output reached a record in October and Iraq boosted oil exports in December. Surging shale output has helped make the United States the world's biggest oil producer, ahead of Saudi Arabia and Russia. Oil production has been at or near record highs in all three countries. Signs of rising production illustrate the challenge facing the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, which are seeking to prop up the market with a supply cut of 1.2 million barrels per day. However, the energy minister for the United Arab Emirates, an OPEC member, said on Tuesday he remained optimistic about achieving a market balance in the first quarter.

2019-01-02,"TORONTO, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar strengthened against its broadly stronger U.S. counterpart on Wednesday, paring some of its 2018 decline as higher oil prices offset domestic data showing a slowdown in manufacturing growth. The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index fell to a seasonally adjusted 53.6 in December, its lowest in nearly two years, from 54.9 in November, as production growth faltered and export orders stagnated. Signs of slower Canadian manufacturing growth came as weak data in Asia and Europe added to fears of a global economic slowdown. Still, stocks pared some earlier losses and the price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, turned higher. U.S. crude oil futures were up nearly 2 percent at $46.31 a  barrel.

2019-01-02,"President Donald Trump set in motion a vast rollback of energy, climate and environmental regulations during his first two years in office. Over the next two years, those actions will face intense scrutiny on Capitol Hill. On Thursday, Democrats will take control of the House of Representatives and the committees that conduct government oversight. Within the first few months of the year, incoming committee chairs intend to hold a series of hearings to pick apart Trump's energy and environmental policies and what role industry insiders played in crafting them. The Trump administration has targeted dozens of rules. Some of the biggest items on its agenda include withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate agreement, expanding drilling on federal lands, and watering down rules ranging from limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants to fuel efficiency in cars and trucks. Rep. Raul Grijalva, the Arizona Democrat tipped to chair the House Natural Resources Committee, says Americans can expect the committee to probe the financial costs and public health risks associated with Interior Department policies under Trump. Those include rolling back methane emissions rules from oil and gas operations and making virtually all federally administered offshore waters available to drillers. ""The Trump administration has spent two years giving away the store to fossil fuel companies, and Republicans in Congress cheered every step of the way,"" says Grijalva.

2019-01-02,"SINGAPORE, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Oil markets fell more than 1 percent in 2019's first trading on Wednesday, pulled down by surging U.S. output and concerns about an economic slowdown in 2019 as factory activity in China, the world's biggest oil importer, contracted. International Brent crude futures were at $53.05 per barrel at 0705 GMT, down 75 cents, or 1.4 percent, from their final close of 2018. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were at $44.83 per barrel, down 58 cents, or 1.3 percent. Factory activity weakened in December across Asia as the Sino-U.S. trade war and a slowdown in Chinese demand hit production in most economies, pointing to a rocky start for the world's top economic growth region in 2019. China on Wednesday cut its first batch of crude import quotas for 2019 versus those a year ago. The Ministry of Commerce granted quotas totalling 89.84 million tonnes in its first allowances for 2019, down from 121.32 million tonnes issued in the first batch of 2018. Independent market analyst Greg McKenna said in a note on Wednesday that it was ""difficult for traders and investors to ignore what looks like a genuine global economic slowdown."" That is also impacting sentiment in oil markets. Oil prices ended 2018 lower for the first time since 2015, after a desultory fourth quarter that saw buyers flee the market over growing worries about too much supply and mixed signals related to renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran. ""Oil prices ... registered their first yearly decline in three years on fears of a slowing global economy and concerns of an ongoing supply glut,"" said Adeel Minhas, a consultant at Australia's Rivkin Securities. For the year, WTI futures slumped nearly 25 percent, while Brent tumbled nearly 20 percent. 'DON'T UNDERESTIMATE SHALE' The outlook for 2019 is riddled with uncertainty, analysts said, including the U.S.-China trade concerns and Brexit, as well as political instability and conflict in the Middle East. A Reuters poll showed oil prices are expected to trade below $70 per barrel in 2019 as surplus production, much of it from the United States, and slowing economic growth undermine efforts led by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut supply and prop up prices. On the production side, all eyes will be on the ongoing surge in U.S. output and on OPEC's and Russia's supply discipline. ""Don't underestimate shale producers and the wider U.S. oil industry in general. Too often this year the market pushed stories ... of bottlenecks yet U.S. oil production will have grown by a massive 2+ million barrels per day between 1.1.2018 and 1.1.2019,"" consultancy JBC Energy said in an analysis of 2018. U.S. crude output rose to an all-time high of 11.537 million bpd in October, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Monday. That makes the United States the world's biggest oil producer ahead of Russia, which said on Wednesday it's own oil production in December hit a record 11.45 million bpd in December, up from a previous record of 11.37 million bpd in November.

In an early December meeting, OPEC and non-OPEC countries agreed to take about 1.2 million barrels a day off the oil market — initially for six months — starting January, amid a persistent imbalance between global oil supply and demand. ""Well, J.P. Morgan said prior to the OPEC meeting early December, that if OPEC didn't really cut by more than around 1.2 million barrels per day, and they did just for the first half, (not) for the full year, that we could gravitate toward ... our low-oil-price scenario, which is $55 Brent for 2019,"" Scott Darling told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Wednesday.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude ended Wednesday's session at a two-week high, up $1.13, or 2.5 percent, to $46.54.
