2019-02-22,"weighs@ NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Oil prices touched their highest since mid-November on Friday and posted weekly gains for the second week in a row, boosted by hopes that U.S.-China trade talks would soon produce a deal, although new record U.S. oil supply limited gains. Brent crude futures briefly reached $67.73 a barrel, their 2019 high. The global benchmark fell 5 cents to settle at $67.12 a barrel. Brent gained 1.2 percent on the week. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 30 cents to settle at $57.26 per barrel, after hitting $57.81 earlier on Friday, also their highest for the year. WTI recorded a 3-percent weekly rise and reached its strongest settlement price of 2019. Top U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators met on Friday to wrap up a week of talks that have seen the two sides struggle to reach a deal by a March 1 deadline. U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at the Oval Office later on Friday. ""Oil prices, as well as the stock market have been rising on the anticipation that China and the U.S. would agree to a trade deal,"" said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. ""In addition, we're seeing a tightening of oil supplies around the world resulting from OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts."" Both oil benchmarks have risen this year after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, began to cut output to prevent a supply glut from growing. Surging U.S. crude oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA>, is partly offsetting OPEC's cuts. U.S. crude production last week climbed to a record 12 million barrels per day as stockpiles built for a fifth straight week to their highest since October 2017 and exports hit an all-time high, the Energy Information Administration said on Thursday. ""We see total U.S. crude production hitting 13 million bpd by year-end, with 2019 averaging 12.5 million bpd,"" U.S. bank Citi said following the release of the EIA report. However, U.S. energy firms cut four oil rigs operating this week after three weeks of adding rigs, General Electric Co's Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its report on Friday. Meanwhile, crude inventories in West Texas fell to the lowest in four months after an additional pipeline started transporting crude from the largest U.S. shale field to the Gulf Coast, largely for exports, data from market intelligence provider Genscape showed. With U.S. supply surging, Goldman Sachs said it expected non-OPEC supply to grow by 1.9 million bpd this year, more than offsetting the OPEC cuts. That means much will depend on demand, which Goldman said it expected to grow by 1.4 million bpd in 2019. Goldman said it expected an average Brent price of $60-$65 per barrel in 2019 and 2020. Money managers cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to Feb. 5, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.

2019-02-22,"Federal regulators on Thursday broke an impasse over approving new projects to export natural gas from the United States, potentially easing the way for a flurry of applications to build the multi-billion dollar facilities. In doing so, the regulators approved a liquefied natural gas export terminal for the first time in two years, pushing through a disagreement over how they should assess the facilities' contribution to climate change. However, divisions remain within the commission on the issue, and one of the four sitting members dissented from the majority decision. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Thursday decided to approve Venture Global's proposed Calcasieu Pass export terminal in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, as well as a pipeline to supply the facility. The project is one of about a dozen vying to tap surging U.S. natural gas production and export LNG, a form of the fuel chilled to liquid form and shipped overseas in massive tankers. However, applications have been held up while FERC's four commissioners hash out the greenhouse gas issue. The five-person commission has been down one member since former commissioner and Republican Kevin McIntyre passed away last month, leaving the body split between two Democrats and two Republicans. FERC Chairman Neil Chatterjee said he's optimistic that in light of Thursday's deal, FERC now has a framework in place that will help the commission more expeditiously process applications. ""No question about it, it's a top priority of mine and I think my colleagues' as well,"" he told CNBC on Friday.

2019-02-22,"NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Stocks rose in major markets on Friday on bets of progress in trade talks between the United States and China, while crude futures hit their highest in over three months, supported by ongoing supply cuts. U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He were set to meet at the Oval Office later in the day in a sign negotiations are advancing. Main indexes on Wall Street rose as trade talk more than offset signs of slower growth in both earnings and the U.S. economy, with the S&P 500 on track for a fourth consecutive week of gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 177.54 points, or 0.69 percent, to 26,028.17, the S&P 500 gained 16.62 points, or 0.60 percent, to 2,791.5 and the Nasdaq Composite added 61.04 points, or 0.82 percent, to 7,520.75. Shares in Asia were buoyed by a late rally in Chinese stocks, with the main blue-chip index of Chinese shares rising over 2 percent to a near seven-month high. Emerging market stocks were up 0.73 percent after touching the highest level since August. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.72 percent higher, while Japan's Nikkei lost 0.18 percent. Trade talks and a growing number of policy U-turns by global central banks have propped up equities in recent weeks, although this week brought the first outflows from emerging market debt and equity funds since October 2018, Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists said, citing EPFR data. CRUDE RISING Oil prices rose, supported by OPEC's ongoing supply cuts and hopes that Washington and Beijing may soon end their trade dispute. U.S. crude rose 0.63 percent to $57.32 per barrel and Brent was last at $67.11, up 0.06 percent on the day. In currencies, the U.S. dollar was little changed against a basket of peers.

The Japanese yen strengthened 0.01 percent versus the greenback at 110.71 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3061, up 0.09 percent on the day. The Australian dollar recovered a day after falling more than 1 percent after Reuters reported the Chinese port of Dalian had barred imports of Australian coal indefinitely. China said on Friday, however, that imports would continue, but customs has stepped up checks on foreign cargoes. Separate comments by Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe that a rate increase may be appropriate next year also helped to boost the Aussie dollar. The Aussie dollar was up 0.71 percent versus the greenback at 0.7139. Despite gains on risky assets, safe-haven U.S. Treasuries also rose in price.

2019-02-22,"The natural gas market is emerging from winter relatively unscathed despite potentially disruptive Chinese tariffs on U.S. gas. But the ongoing trade dispute is still putting a chill on cooperation between the two energy powerhouses and threatens to sideline billions in investment. Chinese tariffs on U.S. natural gas have halted Beijing's purchases of U.S. LNG, a form of the fuel chilled to liquid form for transport by sea. The trade dispute has also delayed at least one LNG export terminal slated for construction in Louisiana and threatens to push back the start date for other facilities. In the long-run, analysts say it's inevitable for gas trade to resume between China and the U.S. China is the engine behind growing LNG demand, while the U.S. is the world's top natural gas producer.

2019-02-22,"TORONTO, Feb 22 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar strengthened against its U.S. counterpart on Friday, rebounding from an earlier three-day low as stocks and oil prices rose and domestic data showed a drop in retail sales that was less than the market expected. Retail sales fell by 0.1 percent in December from November to C$50.35 billion, due to lower gasoline prices, Statistics Canada said. Analysts had forecast a 0.3 percent decrease. In volume terms, retail sales increased 0.2 percent. ""The slight increase in volumes will see monthly GDP tracking forecasts around the 0.0 percent mark for December, which isn't great, but is better than what we had been fearing heading into the week,"" Royce Mendes, a senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said in a research note. U.S. stocks and the price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, were boosted by signs of progress in the ongoing trade talks between the United States and China. U.S. crude prices were up 1.2 percent at $57.65 a  barrel. At 9:12 a.m. (1412 GMT), the Canadian dollar was  trading 0.3 percent higher at 1.3191 to the greenback, or 75.81 U.S. cents. The loonie, which has been the top performing G10 currency since the start of the year, touched its weakest intraday since Tuesday at 1.3242. For the week, the loonie was on track to rise 0.4 percent. Gains for the loonie came a day after Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz reiterated that interest rates needed to move up into a neutral range over time, but that the path back was now ""highly uncertain"" due to global trade disputes and high household debt loads. Canada's once-roaring housing market has been tamed, according to the latest Reuters poll of analysts who predict house prices will rise nationally and that in key urban hot spots they will not outstrip overall inflation over the next two years. Canadian government bond prices were higher across a flatter yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries. The two-year rose 3 Canadian cents to yield 1.779 percent and the 10-year climbed 28 Canadian cents to yield 1.891  percent.
