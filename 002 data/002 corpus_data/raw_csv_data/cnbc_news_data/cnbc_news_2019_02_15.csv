2019-02-15,"It's already a year for the record books. U.S. crude oil, also known as West Texas Intermediate (WTI), is seeing its best start ever. According to the Oil Price Information Service's Tom Kloza, there's not much that could derail the rally through the second quarter. ""We're going to see higher prices than we see right now,"" the firm's co-founder and global head of energy analysis said Thursday on CNBC's ""Futures Now."" However, Kloza, who's known for predicting the 2015 crude collapse, said his forecast comes with a caveat: It'll be a more temperate and gentle year despite the robust start. Overall, he predicted 2019 to be cheaper than last year. In 2018, the U.S. Energy Information Administration finds the average price for WTI crude was $65.06 a barrel. ""The upside is limited to about five dollars a barrel or so – which is probably not a statement you would make in February and many of the last ten years,"" he added. Crude typically sees between $15 to $20 a barrel of upside, according to Kloza. It's different this year, he said, because oil was oversold in December. Right now, he believes it's a balanced market for oil. ""You have a lot of refineries that are down for maintenance — and yet gasoline prices are not moving higher, demand is not moving higher, and that means lower demand for crude,"" said Kloza. On Friday, WTI crude rose 2.2 percent to close at $55.59 a barrel, a three month high. Brent, the international oil benchmark, also set a three month high. ""We're in a Goldilocks sort of situation where the cost of finding the crude in the Permian Basin is coming down,"" Kloza said, speaking of the large oil field covering parts of Texas and New Mexico. ""And, the prices, right now, for crude oil blends beyond the benchmarks, beyond and WTI, are actually off to probably their best start for a new year in 30 years,"" he added.

2019-02-15,"NEW YORK, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Oil prices climbed more than 2 percent on Friday after an outage at Saudi Arabia's offshore oilfield boosted investor expectations for tightening supply. The international Brent crude benchmark rose $1.51, or 2.3 percent, to $66.08 a barrel, the highest since November 2018, by 12:34 p.m. EST (1734 GMT). U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up $1.18 at $55.59 a barrel, or 2.2 percent. The two benchmarks were on track for weekly gains of about 6 percent. The partial closure of Saudi Arabia's Safaniya, the world's largest offshore oilfield, occurred about two weeks ago, a source said on Friday. Safaniya has production capacity of more than 1 million bpd. It was not immediately clear when the field would return to full capacity. ""It's another factor that is raising concerns about the availability of crude,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. ""All of a sudden you don't have to worry just about OPEC cuts. Now you have a problem with Saudi Arabia's ability to actually produce as much oil."" The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies led by Russia started voluntary production cuts last month, aiming to tighten the market. OPEC's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, said on Tuesday it would cut an additional half a million barrels per day (bpd) in March more than it previously pledged, sending prices higher. Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note it expects that by the fourth quarter of 2019, OPEC supply will have declined by 2.5 million bpd from the year-earlier period. Supply has been curbed as well by U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan and Iranian crude and reduced Libyan output because of civil unrest. Security threats could threaten Nigerian production after general elections this weekend as well. Growing investor confidence in the prospect of a coming U.S.-China trade deal also supported prices. Talks between China and the United States to resolve their trade war will restart next week in Washington, with both sides saying this week's negotiations in Beijing showed progress.

2019-02-15,"LONDON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Brent crude oil climbed above $65 a barrel to its highest this year as OPEC-led supply cuts and this week's announcement of a higher than expected cut by Saudi Arabia encouraged investors. The international oil benchmark reached $65.52 by 1500 GMT on Friday, the 95 cent gain equating to a rise of about 1.5 percent. Brent approached near three-month highs and was set for a gain of nearly 5.5 percent on the week. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up about 1.7 percent, rising 91 cents to $55.32. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies led by Russia started voluntary production cuts last month, aiming to tighten the market. Top exporter and de facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia said on Tuesday that in March it would cut more than half a million barrels per day (bpd) more than the deal called for, sending prices surging. The cuts come alongside involuntary production curbs as a result of U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan and Iranian crude, along with curtailed Libyan output because of civil unrest. Prices were also buoyed by the partial closure of Saudi Arabia's Safaniya, its largest offshore oilfield with production capacity of more than 1 million bpd. The shutdown occurred about two weeks ago, a source said, and it was not immediately clear when the field would return to full capacity. ""The market may be reconnecting with its fundamentals, specifically the several major supply chokeholds that have stacked up in recent months over and above the voluntary OPEC output restraints,"" said analyst Vandana Hari of Vanda Insights. Bank of American Merrill Lynch said in a note that it expects a drop of 2.5 million bpd in OPEC supply in the fourth quarter of 2019 from a year earlier. However, the global supply picture remains uncertain. U.S. oil production is on the rise, while the seizure of Libya's main oilfield by Eastern armed forces this week could soon lead to its reopening. But reduced exports from Venezuela and Iran have helped to tighten global supply and security threats could threaten Nigerian production after general elections this weekend. ""Looking ahead, the prognosis for Venezuela and Iran remains skewed to the downside. As such, they should continue to act as important pillars of price support.

2019-02-15,"Analysts say oil prices are approaching breakout levels, and the final day of trading this week will offer clues about whether crude futures can keep rallying. Brent crude on Friday topped $66 a barrel for the first time this year, hitting a roughly three-month closing high at $66.25 and rising 6.7 percent this week. Meanwhile, U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude approached $56 on Friday, settling 2.2 percent higher at $55.59 a barrel, the best closing prices since Nov. 19.  The main catalyst for the bullish run is a sharp pullback in OPEC's output at the start of a six-month production-cutting deal, which was bolstered by top exporter Saudi Arabia's pledge to pump well below its quota. This week, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the kingdom plans to produce 9.8 million barrels a day in March, about half a million barrels below levels the Saudis agreed to and down from 11.1 million bpd in November. That is finally helping oil prices push through resistance built on forecasts for slowing demand and concerns about a sluggish global economy as the U.S.-China trade dispute remains unresolved. ""Oil has previously struggled during previous periods of risk aversion but, like its fellow commodities, is fond of a weaker dollar and is continuing to respond to favourable reports this week,"" Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, wrote in a morning market briefing. ""Brent and WTI are both now seriously testing a major resistance zone, around $65 and $55, respectively, the break of which could be the catalyst for another rally.""

2019-02-15,"SINGAPORE, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Asian refining margins for 10ppm gasoil rose on Friday to their strongest levels in over 2-1/2 months despite firmer crude prices, while a weekly drop in Singapore middle distillate stockpiles reinforced traders' views about tightening supply in the region. Refining margins, also known as cracks, for 10ppm gasoil climbed to $15.27 a barrel over Dubai crude during Asian trade, the highest since Nov. 26. The benchmark gasoil cracks, which have risen about 5 percent this week in a third straight week of gains, were at $14.55 a barrel on Thursday. Inventories for middle distillates in Singapore fell by 161,000 barrels to 11.4 million barrels in the week to Feb. 13 in a fourth straight week of draw downs, data from Enterprise Singapore showed on Thursday. Cash differentials for gasoil with 10ppm sulphur content <GO10-SIN-DIF> narrowed their discounts to 35 cents a barrel to Singapore quotes, compared with a discount of 39 cents per barrel a day earlier. The front-month time spread for 10ppm gasoil, which has remained in a contango market structure since November last year, has narrowed by about 72 percent in the last two weeks, and was at a discount of 9 cents a barrel on Friday. In a contango market structure prompt prices are lower than those for future delivery, which tends to encourage holders of physical barrels to store the product and sell it later to secure higher prices. But a narrowing contango indicates the market is on track to return to backwardation, which is the opposite of contango and is usually seen as a sign of improving fundamentals and a rebalancing market. Meanwhile, jet fuel refining margins rose to $14.25 a barrel over Dubai crude on Friday, up from $13.46 a barrel on Thursday. Cash discounts for jet fuel <JET-SIN-DIF> were at 28 cents a barrel to Singapore quotes on Friday, compared with a discount of 30 cents a barrel on Thursday.

2019-02-15,"SINGAPORE, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Brent crude oil prices hit 2019 highs above $65 per barrel on Friday, spurred by OPEC-led supply cuts and a partial shutdown of Saudi Arabia's biggest offshore oil field. Brent rose as high as $65.10, pushing past the $65 mark for the first time this year, before edging back to $64.89 a barrel by 0531 GMT. That was still 0.5 percent above the last close. The international benchmark for oil prices is at a near 3-month high and set for a 4.5 percent gain for the week. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $54.61 per barrel, up 20 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last settlement. Traders said prices were pushed up by the partial closure of Saudi Arabia's Safaniyah, its biggest offshore oil field with a production capacity of more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd). The shutdown occurred earlier this week, a source said, and it was not immediately clear when the field would return to full capacity. The partial closure comes on top of voluntary supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which Saudi Arabia the the de-facto leader, aimed at tightening the market. The group as well as some non-OPEC producers including Russia late last year agreed to cut crude output by a joint 1.2 million bpd. Top exporter Saudi Arabia said it would cut even more in March than the deal called for. Russia has cut its oil production by 80,000-90,000 barrels per day from its level in October, Moscow's reference level for its cuts, the country's energy minister said. ""Brent should average $70 per barrel in 2019, helped by voluntary (Saudi, Kuwait, UAE) and involuntary (Venezuela, Iran) declines in OPEC supply,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note. It also expects ""a 2.5 million barrels per day drop in OPEC supply from 4Q18 into 4Q19."" Standing against these declines is soaring U.S. crude production <C-OUT-T-EIA>, which rose by more than 2 million bpd last year, to 11.9 million bpd, making America the world's biggest oil producer. Most analysts expect U.S. output to rise past 12 million bpd soon, and perhaps even hit 13 million bpd by the end of the year. Rising U.S. shale oil supply, increasing spare capacity within OPEC and stagnating fuel consumption meant the medium-term oil price outlook was lower, BoAML said. ""We see growing downside risks to medium-term oil prices on rising U.S. supply and slower consumption,"" the U.S. bank said. It expected Brent to range between $50 and $70 per barrel in the coming five years.
