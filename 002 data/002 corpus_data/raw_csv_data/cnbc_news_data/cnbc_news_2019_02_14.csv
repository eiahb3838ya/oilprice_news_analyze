2019-02-14,"(Re-leads with 2019 price highs, adds comment) SINGAPORE, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Oil prices rallied on Friday, with Brent crude futures hitting fresh 2019 highs amid U.S. sanctions against Venezuela and Iran and supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Brent pushed above $65 per barrel for the first time in 2019, before edging back to $64.91 a barrel by 0143 GMT. That was still 0.5 percent above the last close. The international benchmark for oil prices is at a near 3-month high and set for a 4.5 percent gain for the week. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $54.74 per barrel, up 33 cents, or 0.6 percent, from their last settlement. OPEC and some non-affiliated suppliers including Russia are withholding supply in order to tighten the market and prop up prices. The producer group known as OPEC+ has agreed to cut crude output by a joint 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd). Top exporter Saudi Arabia said it would cut even more in March than the deal called for. Russia has cut its oil production by 80,000-90,000 barrels per day from its level in October, Moscow's reference level for its cuts, the country's energy minister said. Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note that ""Brent should average $70 per barrel in 2019, helped by voluntary (Saudi, Kuwait, UEA) and involuntary (Venezuela, Iran) declines in OPEC supply."" The U.S. bank added that it expects ""a 2.5 million barrels per day drop in OPEC supply from 4Q18 into 4Q19."" Standing against the supply cuts is soaring U.S. crude production <C-OUT-T-EIA>, which rose by more than 2 million bpd last year, to 11.9 million bpd, making America the world's biggest oil producer. Most analysts expect U.S. output to rise past 12 million bpd soon, and perhaps even hit 13 million bpd by the end of the year.

2019-02-14,"SYDNEY, Feb 15 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices rose on Friday, gaining for a fourth day on hopes of further supply cuts by major exporters, despite uncertainty about U.S.-China trade talks. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $54.79 per barrel at 0038 GMT, up 40 cents, or 0.7 percent, from their last settlement. They rose 51 cents, or 0.95 percent, on Thursday.

2019-02-14,"NEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher on Thursday and Brent hit the highest level this year, but gains were capped after the steepest decline in U.S. retail spending since 2009 heightened investor fears of a global economic slowdown. U.S. stocks recovered from declines triggered by bleak retail data to trade flat by afternoon, as investors focused on signs of progress in the ongoing U.S.-China trade talks. Oil prices fluctuated with the equities markets as the U.S. economy's outlook was further dimmed by other data showing an unexpected increase in the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits last week. ""Between supply issues out of Venezuela and Saudi Arabia and implications for demand swirling around the market as a result of the US-China trade war ... the crude oil and distillate markets have been subjected to a tug-of-war that has kept prices severely range-bound,"" said David Thompson, executive vice-president at Powerhouse, an energy-specialized commodities broker in Washington. Brent futures ended the session up 96 cents, or 1.5 percent, at $64.57 a barrel, after hitting a 2019 high of $64.81, while U.S. crude rose 51 cents, or 0.95 percent, to $54.41 a barrel, down from a session high of $54.68. The price of crude has gained nearly 20 percent this year, driven primarily by the prospect of a decline in oil supply from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other top exporters such as Russia. The producer group known as OPEC+ has agreed to cut crude output by a joint 1.2 million barrels per day. Top exporter Saudi Arabia said it would cut even more in March than the deal called for. ""While medium-term trends pose some challenges, we still see a balanced oil supply/demand outlook this year. Brent should average $70 in 2019, helped by voluntary (Saudi, Kuwait, UAE) and involuntary (Venezuela, Iran) declines in OPEC supply,"" Bank of America analysts said in a note. ""Some of today's recovery in the oil also appeared to be related to some weakening in the U.S. dollar following early strong gains,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said. The dollar dropped to session lows on Thursday morning following the U.S. retail sales report. Oil prices also drew support from a surprise increase in China's exports in January and a sharp rise in imports of crude oil before the Lunar New Year holidays in February. However, in physical markets, the steep rise in availability of U.S. shale oil is leading to a build in domestic inventories of crude and in refined products. Government data on Wednesday showed U.S. crude stocks last week rose to their highest since November 2017 as refiners cut runs to the lowest since October 2017.

2019-02-14,"In a not-too-distant future, renewable energy becomes the world's biggest source of power generation. A quarter of the distances that humans travel by vehicle will be in electric cars. U.S. dominance in the oil market begins to wane, and OPEC's influence is resurgent, as crude demand finally peaks. That is the vision laid out by British oil and gas giant BP on Thursday in its latest Annual Energy Outlook. The closely followed report lays out a vision through 2040 for Earth's energy future, provided government policy, technology and consumer preferences evolve in line with recent trends. BP forecasts that the world's energy demand will grow by a third through 2040, driven by rising consumption in China, India and other parts of Asia. About 75 percent of that increase will come from the need to power industry and buildings. At the same time, energy demand will continue to grow in the transportation sector, but that growth will slow sharply as vehicles become more efficient and more consumers opt for electric cars. But despite the increase in supply, BP thinks two-thirds of the world's population will still live in places with relatively low energy consumption per head. The takeaway: The world will need to generate more energy.

2019-02-14,"International pressure on Saudi Arabia is increasingly being deployed by lawmaking bodies in ways that could slow much-needed foreign investment, regional analysts say. On Wednesday, the European Commission (EC) added Saudi Arabia to its list of ""high-risk third countries"" that have ""strategic deficiencies"" in their anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regimes, also known as AML/CFT. The designation may not stick; it can be reversed by the European Council or European Parliament in the one-to-two month period that the bodies have to vote on it. But the move highlights a new willingness by lawmakers to more intensely scrutinize Saudi compliance with international conventions and withdraw privileges that the kingdom has enjoyed until now.  As a result of the listing, the EC wrote in a statement, banks and other bodies operating under the EU's anti-money laundering rules ""will be required to apply increased checks (due diligence)"" on transactions between individuals and institutions from Saudi Arabia, as well as more than 20 other listed countries, ""to better identify any suspicious money flows.""  The impact of the Commission's decision really depends on its acceptance by other European lawmaking entities as well as that of the U.S. Already France and the U.K. have expressed their opposition, having significant trade ties and weapons exports to the kingdom, and may attempt to reach a middle ground with the EC.  Specific evidence for Saudi Arabia's listing has not been publicly disclosed, but the EC cites risks posed by ""third country jurisdictions which have strategic deficiencies in their AML/CFT regimes that pose significant threats to the financial system of the Union.""

2019-02-14,"MOSCOW/LONDON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - A clash between trading house Vitol and Azerbaijan's SOCAR over Caspian Sea oil shipments is forcing Turkmenistan to slash exports of crude due to a lack of tankers. Turkmenistan typically exports about 200,000 tonnes of oil per year via the Caspian to world markets, mainly from fields operated by the UAE's ENOC and Italy's Eni, but flows have halved in recent weeks, six traders involved in operations said. That happened after Turkmen producers decided to export oil via Russia with the help of Swiss trader Vitol and ditch the previous Azeri route, operated by state-owned SOCAR. The reasons behind the change are not fully clear but trading sources attributed it to pricing disagreements. Three trading sources said SOCAR had raised tariffs, while one source said Vitol had offered lower tariffs. ""The only problem was that Vitol was lacking tankers,"" one of the sources involved in operations said. Vitol said it would not comment on commercial activity or trading. SOCAR, ENOC and the Turkmen Energy Ministry declined to comment. Russian pipeline monopoly Transneft did not respond to a request for comment. Eni said it had not been forced to reduce exports or production and that ""the situation was stable"". Russian Energy Ministry data shows that no exports of Turkmen oil occurred via Russia in January. In February, only 80,000 tonnes will be loaded from the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk. Eni declined to say why its production and exports were stable after such a drop in shipments or whether it was stockpiling oil in Turkmenistan. SUNKEN SHIP SOCAR controls the Caspian's largest fleet of small and mid-sized tankers, which used to ship Turkmen oil to Baku. From there, it was loaded into the BTC pipeline to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. In Turkmenistan, ENOC's Dragon Oil is developing the Cheleken oilfield, with annual output of some 2.4 million tonnes. Eni produces nearly 300,000 tonnes per year from the Okarem field. In 2018, crude from Dragon Oil was exported via BTC through SOCAR. Eni also sold volumes to Vitol, which in turn resold it to SOCAR. Under new long-term deals for this year, Dragon and Eni chose Vitol to export oil to the Russian port of Makhachkala, where Transneft is taking it to Novorossiisk. Upset by the development, SOCAR refused to let Vitol use its tankers, the six traders said. ""Everyone is free to defend their commercial interests,"" said a source at SOCAR when asked about tankers. Vitol has secured several tankers, but these will be able to transport only around 120,000 tonnes a month until the Russian river-canal system becomes ice-free and opens to navigation in April, trading sources said. Shipments can then increase. The Caspian tanker shortage was such that Vitol had to charter old ships, including the Grigoriy Bugrov, a 44-year-old vessel that sank in 2011 and was later repaired. ""These vessels were chartered on an exceptional basis and only after physical inspection by an experienced professional. Vitol is extremely mindful of its responsibilities in respect of customers, stakeholders and the environment,"" Vitol said when asked about the Bugrov tanker. The slowness of crude exports has forced Turkmen producers to stockpile oil throughout January and February, the six trading sources said. ""Storage tanks are full so the Turkmens now face the risk of suspending some production,"" a market source familiar with the matter said. STAKES HIGH Despite their modest volumes, Turkmen oil exports have always been a high-stakes, high-margins game. Oil is bought in Turkmenistan at a discount of several dollars per barrel to the dated Brent benchmark. Crude is then sold in the Mediterranean at a premium to dated Brent as Azeri BTC - in case of shipments via Azerbaijan - or as Siberian Light, which also normally trades at a premium to dated Brent if it flows via Russias Novorossiisk. ""Losing Turkmen crude means lower exports via BTC and lower crude quality,"" a trader with a European refiner said. For Russia, getting Turkmen volumes does the opposite - it helps improve the quality of oil in the pipeline system. Azeri BTC crude oil loadings are scheduled to fall some 10 percent in March versus February. The situation regarding quality was not critical, the SOCAR source said. ""Negotiations about getting oil from Turkmenistan are not over ... We hope there is a chance that we will get some Turkmen oil volumes,"" the SOCAR source added.

2019-02-14,"Oil rose for a third day on Thursday, with Brent crude reaching its highest so far this year, but gains were capped after the steepest decline in U.S. retail spending since 2009 heightened investor fears of a global economic slowdown.
