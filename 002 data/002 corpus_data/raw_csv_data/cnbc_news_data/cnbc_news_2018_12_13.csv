2018-12-13,"(Recasts, adds comment, China data, updates prices) SINGAPORE, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday as investors cashed in gains of more than 2 percent made during the previous session on concerns demand may slump amid slowing economic growth, though there are still expectations for producer supply cuts to support prices. China, the world's second-largest economy and the largest crude importer, on Friday reported some of the slowest retail sales and industrial output growth in years for November, highlighting the risks of the country's trade dispute with the United States. Oil refinery throughput in November in China fell from October, which was the second-highest month on record, suggesting an easing in Chinese oil demand, though runs were 2.9 percent higher than a year earlier. However, some support for prices remains because of the output cuts agreed between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producers including Russia. That could create a supply deficit by the second quarter of next year, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday. Brent crude oil futures were at $61.09 per barrel at 0353 GMT, down 36 cents, or 0.6 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $52.47 per barrel, down 11 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last settlement. ""I think after the big moves overnight there's a little bit of self-shock among traders, volumes are well down... I don't see a great deal of follow through on last night's moves,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief markets strategist at CMC markets. International benchmark Brent crude rose 2.2 percent on Thursday, while WTI climbed 2.8 percent. ""After the big move yesterday, it's a little bit of consolidation that's happening,"" said Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Probis Securities in Sydney. For the week, however, Brent is set to drop 0.9 percent and WTI is set to fall 0.3 percent. As a part of the OPEC supply-cutting deal agreed last week, its de facto leader Saudi Arabia plans to reduce its output to 10.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in January. In China, refineries processed 50.46 million tonnes of crude oil last month, or 12.28 million bpd, up 2.9 percent from the same month last year, the National Bureau of Statistics reported. However, that is down from October and from the record of 12.49 million bpd reported in September. Still for the first 11 months of the year, refinery output gained 7.2 percent to 554.48 million tonnes, or 12.12 million bpd, on track for an annual record.

2018-12-13,"NEW YORK, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Oil prices climbed more than 2 percent on Thursday, after data showed inventory declines in the United States and as investors began to expect that the global oil market could have a deficit sooner than they had previously thought. OPEC's output agreement with Russia and Canada's decision to mandate production cuts could create an oil market supply deficit by the second quarter of next year, if top producers stick to the deal, the International Energy Agency said in its monthly Oil Market Report. U.S. crude inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. crude futures, fell by nearly 822,000 barrels in the week through Dec. 11, traders said, citing data from market intelligence firm Genscape. Brent crude settled $1.30, or 2.16 percent, higher at $61.45 per barrel while U.S. light crude rose $1.43, or 2.8 percent, to end the session at $52.58 a barrel. ""Other than some additional bullish statement out of the Saudis or Russians regarding strict adherence to last week's agreement or a supply disruption somewhere around the globe, we don't expect any headlines capable of pushing oil values much above this month's highs even when stretching a view through year's end,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. Global oil supply has outstripped demand over the last six months, inflating inventories and pushing crude oil's price at the end of November to its lowest in more than a year. But the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other big producers including Russia said last week they agreed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd). Still, oil demand growth is slowing, OPEC said. OPEC said on Wednesday that demand for its crude in 2019 would fall to 31.44 million bpd, 100,000 bpd less than predicted last month and 1.53 million bpd below what it currently produces. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said his country has no plans to reduce its oil production but will remain a member of OPEC, the official news agency IRNA reported. Factors such as production cuts and output losses elsewhere should keep markets tight in the first half, Jefferies analyst Jason Gammel said.

2018-12-13,"Legendary oil trader Andy Hall says crude prices have likely hit a bottom after plunging more than 30 percent over the last two months. ""I think with prices hovering around or a little over $50 a barrel, I think you would have to have a pretty negative outlook on the global economy to believe that prices will continue their downward trajectory,"" he said in an interview Thursday on Bloomberg TV. ""So I think on balance, if you want to place a bet on oil right now, you're probably better off betting on it going up than going down."" The former oil trader for Citi is famed for predicting a bull market for crude, a feat that earned him a $100 million payout at the investment bank. Some of the shine has come off Hall's reputation since the man once deemed an oil ""god"" closed his hedge fund, Astenbeck Capital Management, following hefty losses on crude bets last year. Today, Hall still trades oil with his own money and serves as an advisory board member to Orbital Insight, a company that uses satellite information to provide real-time data on crude and fuel stockpiles. Hall says he's not expecting a global recession. In the absence of a worldwide slowdown, a correction like the one gripping the oil market today tends to temper supply growth and stimulate demand for fuel. For Hall, the impact of OPEC's recently announced production cuts is ""the $64,000 question,"" but it's only one piece of the puzzle. The oil market is also grappling with headwinds for fuel demand, concerns about a looming U.S.-China trade war and U.S. dollar strength that tends to weigh on crude prices, according to Hall. ""On the other hand, not only have you had OPEC cut production, there's no question that lower prices will have an impact on production growth here in the U.S.,"" Hall said. That said, Hall believes the growth in U.S. shale oil output has been the biggest surprise this year. ""Right now, year-over-year growth in crude production here in the U.S. is about 2 million barrels a day. Back in January, the government's EIA was forecasting growth of half a million barrels a day, so that's a staggering difference,"" he said.

2018-12-13,"While crude exporting countries worry about bearish forecasts for energy markets, the big oil supermajors can withstand fluctuating oil prices in the coming year, one ratings agency says. Cost cuts in the industry from previous years and promising cash flow potential mean the world's largest publicly traded international oil companies (IOCs) — Exxon, Shell, Chevron, BP, Eni and Total — needn't worry even if oil falls to $50 a barrel, according to S&P Global Ratings. ""Supermajors and these guys, the big players, the IOCs, they reckon they can break even with Brent at $50 (per barrel),"" Simon Redmond, senior director of corporate ratings at S&P Global Ratings, told CNBC Thursday. ""So, whether its $65 or $60, they're looking pretty good. And they should be able to generate meaningful cash flow."" The ratings agency forecasts global benchmark Brent crude, currently trading in the $58 to $60 per barrel range, at $65 a barrel in 2019 and $55 in longer term. Other forecasters see the commodity at anywhere between $55 to as high as $80 in the coming year, underlining the lack of consensus and predictability in the market. Last weekend's announced OPEC production cut of 1.2 million barrels by January did little to boost prices, deepening concerns among exporters that pressures like waning demand and booming shale production in the U.S. will only push prices lower. Brent has fallen more than 25 percent from its early October highs of more than $86. S&P expects aggregate crude production to grow — something OPEC likely won't be thrilled about.

2018-12-13,"(Updates with comment, details) LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The global oil market could move into deficit sooner than expected thanks to OPEC's output agreement with Russia and to Canada's decision to cut supply, the International Energy Agency said on Thursday. The Paris-based IEA kept its 2019 forecast for global oil demand growth at 1.4 million barrels per day, unchanged from its projection last month, and said it expected growth of 1.3 million bpd this year. Uncertainty over the global economy stemming from U.S.-China trade tensions could undermine oil consumption next year, as growth in supply gathers pace. ""For 2019, our demand growth outlook remains at 1.4 million bpd even though oil prices have fallen back considerably since the early October peak,"" the IEA said. ""Some of the support provided by lower prices will be offset by weaker economic growth globally, and particularly in some emerging economies."" The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed last week with Russia, Oman and other producers to cut oil output by 1.2 million bpd from January to stem a build-up in unused inventories of fuel. The decision by the government of Canada's Alberta province to force oil producers to curtail supply will bring the largest reduction to crude output next year, the IEA said. Alberta crude and oil sands output will drop by 325,000 bpd from January to force down vast inventories that built up because of pipeline capacity constraints. The oil price has fallen by nearly a third so far this quarter to around $61 a barrel, from a four-year peak close to $87 in early October. In its previous report in November, the IEA said it expected the global oil market to remain in surplus throughout 2019. Now, it expects a deficit to materialize by the second quarter of next year, provided OPEC sticks to its supply deal. ""Time will tell how effective the new production agreement will be in rebalancing the oil market,"" the IEA said. Part of the oil-price weakness in the second half of this year stems from concern about how much an economic slowdown could eat into demand growth. The International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development expect the global economy to expand more slowly next year than forecast six months ago. The OECD in November projected that world economic growth would slow to 3.5 percent in 2019 from 3.8 percent this year. ""Uncertainty about trade tensions and tighter monetary policies continue to affect confidence and investment. The OECDs lower expectation for the world economy in 2019 could reduce oil demand growth by roughly 100,000 bpd,"" the IEA said.

The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said demand for its crude in 2019 would fall to 31.44 million barrels per day (bpd), 100,000 bpd less than predicted last month and 1.53 million bpd less than it currently produces. This adds to the concerns of several market watchers that the decision led by the group to cut production might not be enough to override a glut or push prices higher. Oil market participants are concerned about the likelihood of weaker macroeconomic growth, which could rein in any expansion in oil demand, analysts said. ""If we do see a reduction in global growth risk, then we are monitoring increases in demand in combination with supply being absorbed,"" said Hue Frame, portfolio manager at Frame Funds in Sydney. ""There are so many moving parts at the moment that it is difficult to provide a convincing forecast,"" Frame said. He added, however, that there is a significant upside to prices going forward.
