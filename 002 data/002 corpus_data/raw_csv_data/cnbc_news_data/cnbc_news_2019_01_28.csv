2019-01-28,"SYDNEY, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Tuesday, edging up from a near two-week low in the previous session when prices fell around 3 percent on fears of supply growth and a global economic slowdown. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $52.07 per barrel, up 8 cents from their last settlement. WTI futures closed down 3.2 percent on Monday when prices touched $51.33 a barrel - the lowest since Jan. 17. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade, after closing down 2.8 percent in the previous session when prices hit a low of $59.49 a barrel - the lowest since Jan. 15. ""Rising supplies continue to put downward pressure on crude prices despite the efforts of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other major producers to limit production,"" said Alfonso Esparza, senior market analyst, OANDA.

2019-01-28,"Chinese stocks, especially ones that are new to U.S. markets, may seem like appealing investments, but to CNBC's Jim Cramer, most of them aren't worth the risk. In 2018, 31 Chinese companies had initial public offerings on U.S. stock exchanges, up from 12 the year before. The 2018 deals raised about $8.5 billion in gross proceeds, accounting for roughly 18 percent of the U.S. IPO market. But aside from a few decent names like Tencent Music Entertainment, which Cramer tentatively recommended after its IPO in December, investors should steer clear of this volatile group, the ""Mad Money"" host said. Still, ""there are some exceptions,"" he told investors Monday. ""Larger companies from China with higher profiles do tend to perform better. [...] If you absolutely have to dabble in Chinese IPOs, please, stick with the larger, high-quality companies that we know more about, that even can be household names like Alibaba."" But, even with Alibaba, he insisted that you should invest ""only if you want to go there.""

2019-01-28,"The most important trend happening in the oil market has to do with China, oil guru and RBN Energy President and Principal Energy Markets Consultant Rusty Braziel tells CNBC's Jim Cramer. Braziel, a frequent ""Mad Money"" guest who has correctly predicted several oil price collapses in recent years, referenced the commodity's price drop in October of last year. After starting the month near four-year highs, crude oil prices saw their biggest monthly drop in over two years. Since October, oil prices have been trading lower, a trend some have connected to incipient economic weakness in China. While Cramer wasn't convinced by that line of thinking, Braziel said in a Monday interview that it actually had merit. ""If demand in China is down, if the economy in China is down, that means the total demand for crude oil is going to be down. If crude oil demand drops, then total demand drops, then … crude oil prices are likely to decline, too,"" Braziel said. ""As a matter of fact, that's really the most important thing that's going on right now, and it's what happened back in 2014."" In the fourth quarter of 2014, crude oil prices saw a steep decline during a worldwide oil glut, in which global production exceeded demand. From their highs in June to their troughs in December, they lost over 40 percent in market value. ""In 2014, the economy got weaker, and when that happened, the market lost confidence in its ability to absorb incremental production of crude oil from the United States,"" Braziel explained. ""That's exactly what happened in October."" As for where oil's going next, Braziel's answer wasn't quite as colorful, but it could come as a relief to energy market-watchers. ""The market has recognized that it was never going to be $70,"" he said, pointing to the oil futures curve. ""It was never going to be $40, $42. It's going to be bouncing back and forth between some number around $55 or $60."" U.S. crude prices fell Monday amid worries about a global economic slowdown. West Texas Intermediate crude shed 3.2 percent, settling at $51.99 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, lost 2.8 percent, ending the day at $59.93.

2019-01-28,"NEW YORK, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Oil fell about 3 percent on Monday, its biggest one-day percentage drop in a month, after an increase in U.S. crude drilling pointed to further supply growth amid continuing concerns about a global economic slowdown. Brent crude oil futures sank $1.71, or 2.8 percent, to settle at $59.93 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude slumped $1.70, or 3.2 percent, to settle at $51.99 a barrel. The last time both crude benchmarks saw bigger daily percentage drops was on Dec. 27. ""We're seeing oil prices really start to break down here,"" said Phillip Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago. ""One of the factors that played (into prices) is the rising rig count that we saw on Friday."" U.S. drillers added 10 oil rigs last week, according to energy services firm Baker Hughes on Friday, in another sign of the expanding record U.S. crude production that has soured market sentiment. The trade war between Washington and Beijing weighed on futures as investor optimism waned that the two sides would soon end the months-long tariff fight that has damaged China's economy. That, coupled with uncertainty about how long the U.S. government will stay open after Washington agreed to end a historic shutdown, dampened investor optimism, said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. ""I think both those factors seem to have sparked fears about slowing demand growth, which have been one of the main bearish drivers in the market for a while,"" McGillian said. Crude futures remain on course for their strongest monthly gains in more than two years following production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies this month. Brent has risen nearly 12 percent so far in January, which would be the largest monthly percentage increase since December 2016. WTI has risen more than 13 percent this month, the biggest jump since April 2016, when it surged almost 20 percent. Investors have added to bets on a sustained rise in the oil price this month for the first time since September, according to data from the InterContinental Exchange. Much of the demand outlook hinges on China and whether its refiners will continue to import crude at 2018's breakneck pace. Industrial companies in China reported a second monthly fall in earnings in December, despite the government's efforts to support borrowing and investment.

The move comes after a turbulent week for Venezuela that has created a standoff over the country's leadership. The sanctions aim to transfer control of Venezuela's oil wealth to forces that oppose socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro and deprive the strongman of resources that could prolong his grip on power. Last week, the opposition leader of Venezuela's National Assembly, Juan Guaido, named himself interim president amid street protests. President Donald Trump soon recognized Guaido as the nation's leader and his administration has been marshaling international support for the opposition figure since then.

Saudi Arabia launched a National Industrial Development and Logistics Program (NIDLP) on Monday as the kingdom hopes to attract 1.6 trillion riyals ($426 billion) of foreign investment by 2030, specifically into the industry, logistics, mining and energy sectors. ""This is a program that integrates four major pillars of the Saudi economy, they're all active now.

2019-01-28,"Saudi Arabia's energy minister is hoping Russia will pull its weight on recently agreed to OPEC oil production cuts despite its slow start, expressing confidence Monday that the world's second-largest exporter would come through. ""We're committed both to the agreement in December. ... All indications so far so good, the Russians have promised me that they will pick up the pace,"" Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told CNBC's Hadley Gamble in Riyadh on Monday. OPEC members, along with several other countries, in December agreed on output cuts totaling 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in order to stem a sinking market and support their own export-dependent economies. ""OPEC plus"" refers to the group's cooperation with the non-OPEC producers like Russia and other former Soviet states. Russia was more reluctant to cut its output, as its growth is heavily dependent on robust crude exports. Russia has initially let the Saudis shoulder the bulk of output cuts. The top OPEC ally, which in late 2016 began a cooperation agreement with Riyadh to stabilize oil prices, has often said that $60 per barrel is enough to meet its economic needs. Moscow in December said it would cut production by 50,000 to 60,000 barrels per day in January, whereas Saudi Arabia reportedly pledged to cut by 900,000 barrels a day compared with November levels. Russia pumped a record 11.45 million bpd in December, an increase of 80,000 bpd on the previous month, its Energy Ministry reported in early January. Saudi Arabia's crude output, by contrast, fell by more than 450,000 bpd from November to December. Global benchmark Brent crude has bounced back 25 percent from its late December rout, but is still far from the more than $86 per barrel highs it witnessed in October.

2019-01-28,"TORONTO, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar weakened against its U.S. counterpart on Monday, pulling back from its highest in more than two weeks as oil prices fell and investors grew more worried about China's economy. World stocks were pressured by a second straight monthly fall in profits for China's industrial firms. Officials from China are due to visit Washington this week for the next round of trade negotiations with the United States. The trade dispute between the world's two largest economies could worsen the outlook for global growth. Canada is running a current account deficit and exports many commodities, including oil, so its economy could be hurt by a slowdown in the global flow of trade or capital. The price of oil fell after U.S. companies added rigs for the first time this year, a signal that crude output may rise further. U.S. crude oil futures were down nearly 2  percent at $52.63 a barrel. Still, oil has rebounded about 24 percent since hitting an 18-month low in December. At 8:58 a.m. (1358 GMT), the Canadian dollar was  trading 0.3 percent lower at 1.3257 to the greenback, or 75.43 U.S. cents. The currency's weakest level of the session was 1.3264, while it touched its strongest since Jan. 11 at 1.3204. The 17-day high for the loonie came despite weak domestic data last week that prompted some economists to project that Canada's economy contracted in November. November gross domestic product data is due on Thursday. Canadian government bond prices were mixed across the yield curve, with the two-year up 0.5 Canadian cent to yield 1.882 percent and the 10-year falling 1  Canadian cent to yield 1.979 percent.

2019-01-28,"An escalating trade war between the world's two largest economies would be nonsensical, according to executives from the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market. Oil giants and energy companies are increasingly interested in LNG — a form of natural gas chilled to liquid form — as governments around the world mandate using cleaner fuel than coal. A long-running trade conflict between the U.S. and China has battered business and consumer sentiment in recent months — with the LNG export industry particularly vulnerable. When asked whether the ongoing trade dispute was a danger to the LNG market, Lorenzo Simonelli, chief executive of Baker Hughes, a GE company, said: ""I don't think so — It's early to say that and I think we're in a long game here."" ""It's going to play itself out. There are discussions this week and there will be more discussions. A project doesn't convert in just one month, so there is a long lead time for the actual projects to come into play,"" Simonelli told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick on Monday. The total number of U.S. LNG vessels that went to China in 2018 reportedly fell by around 20 percent when compared to the year previous, amid an intensifying trade war between Washington and Beijing.

2019-01-28,"Oil prices tumbled on Monday as weak industrial earnings in both China and the United States raised fresh concerns about a global slowdown that could cut fuel demand. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude ended Monday's session down $1.70, or 3.2 percent, at $51.99 a barrel, its lowest closing price in two weeks. Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, was down $1.71, or 2.8 percent, at $59.93 around 2:30 p.m. ET, slipping below $60 for the first time in nearly two weeks. Profits at Chinese industrial firms contracted in December for a second straight month, China's National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday. The latest datapoint adds to series of weak signals coming from the world's second biggest economy. Last week, Beijing reported that the economy grew at the slowest pace in nearly 30 years in 2018.  Later on Monday, bellwether industrial Caterpillar issued weak guidance for future profits and reported disappointing fourth-quarter earnings, citing the impact of tariffs and slower sales in China. ""Those Caterpillar earnings were sort of a canary in the coal mine in terms of industrial activity out there. Losses sped up after that hit the tape,"" said John Kilduff, founding partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital. Kilduff says markets will be closely watching upcoming data from Chinese state run firms and the private manufacturing sector. Also critical will be headlines coming out of the latest trade talks between Washington and Beijing scheduled for later this week, he added. The ongoing trade dispute — and the threat of higher tariffs on hundreds of billions in goods — is keeping markets on edge. But despite the trade tension, oil remains on pace for strong gains in January. WTI is up more than 14 percent this month, while Brent is on pace for a gain of about 11 percent. The price has been supported by early signs that OPEC and its allies are delivering on their pledge to cut production by 1.2 million barrels a day in order to drain oversupply from the market. Russia, the second biggest contributor to the production cuts, has promised to ""pick up the pace,"" Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih told CNBC on Monday.
