2019-01-31,"SINGAPORE, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Oil prices held steady on Friday, torn between hopes the United States and China could soon settle their trade disputes and new data raising fresh concerns over China's economic slowdown. International Brent crude oil futures were at $60.87 per barrel at 0244, 3 cents aboe their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were at $53.70 per barrel, down 9 cents, or 0.2 percent their last settlement. Oil futures received support from a broader financial market rally, which saw Asian shares hit four-month highs on Friday on hopes the United States and China could strike a trade deal. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping soon to try to seal a comprehensive trade deal as Trump and his top trade negotiator both cited substantial progress in two days of high-level talks. Yet prices were weighed down by a survey on Friday that showed China's factory activity shrank by the most in almost three years in January amid slumping orders, reinforcing fears a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy is deepening. Despite these concerns, traders said oil markets overall are being supported by supply cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which according to a Reuters poll pumped 30.98 million barrels per day (bpd) in January, down 890,000 bpd from December. In Venezuela, meanwhile, U.S. sanctions imposed on state oil firm PDVSA this week are keeping tankers stuck at ports and are expected to accelerate the supply drop in February. ""The latest U.S. sanctions could directly halt around 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuelan exports to the U.S.,"" Citi bank said. Much Venezuelan crude oil is rated as heavy and requires the light petroleum naphtha, much of it supplied from the United States, for dilution before export to refineries. ""An additional 350,000 bpd of Venezuelan oil output is at risk due to the lack of U.S. dilutents, a result of the U.S. product exports ban with immediate effect,"" Citi said.

2019-01-31,"SYDNEY, Feb 1 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices edged higher on Friday, recovering from losses of nearly 1 percent in the previous session, as data showed major exporters are quickly reducing output in line with a supply cutting pact. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were at $53.96 per barrel at 0009 GMT, up 17 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their last settlement. In the previous session, WTI hit $55.37 a barrel, the highest since Nov. 21, before reversing course to end lower. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade, after closing up 0.4 percent in the previous session. ""Prices supported by data showing further falls in output,"" ANZ Bank said in a research note. The 14-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped 30.98 million barrels per day (bpd) in January, a Reuters survey showed, down 890,000 bpd from December and the largest month-on-month drop since January 2017.

2019-01-31,"LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied after two days of gains on Thursday, as lower-than-expected U.S. fuel stock rises and U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan output boosted investor confidence but U.S.-China trade tensions weighed on sentiment. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 9 cents at $54.14 per barrel at 0955 GMT. Brent crude oil futures were up 14 cents at $61.79 per barrel. The March contract expires on Thursday. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday showed U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose less than expected last week due to lower imports, notably a fall in Saudi crude supply. ""Crude oil prices were stronger after signs emerged that OPEC cuts are impacting trade,"" ANZ bank analysts wrote in a note, calling it the second lowest weekly level since 2010. U.S. sanctions imposed on state oil firm Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) this week are also causing some supply disruptions. Oil inventories have started to build up at Venezuela's oil ports and terminals as PDVSA is finding it cannot export crude at its usual rate due to U.S. sanctions imposed this week. As of Wednesday, Venezuela had 25 tankers with nearly 18 million barrels of crude - representing about two weeks of the country's production - waiting to load or expecting authorisation to set sail, shipping data showed. ""With the likelihood of a forthcoming decline in Venezuelan production, producer cuts to rebalance the market will prove more effective,"" Harry Tchilinguirian, strategist at BNP Paribas in London, told the Reuters Global Oil Forum. ""Having said that, any gain in oil prices still remains contingent on the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks."" Global markets anxiously await the outcome of talks which began in Washington on Wednesday aimed at easing a months-long tariff war between the world's top two economies. The two-day talks are expected to be tense, with little indication that Beijing will address core U.S. demands. If the two sides cannot reach a deal soon, Washington has threatened to more than double tariffs on Chinese goods on March 2.

2019-01-31,"up exports@ SINGAPORE, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose for a third day on Thursday, pushed up by lower imports into the United States amid OPEC efforts to tighten the market, and as Venezuela struggles to keep up its crude exports after Washington imposed sanctions on the nation. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $54.47 per barrel at 0758 GMT, up 24 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures were up 36 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $62.01 per barrel. The price rise came after a report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday showed a drop in Saudi crude supply to the United States. ""Crude oil prices were stronger after signs emerged that OPEC cuts are impacting trade. EIA's weekly report showed that U.S. imports from Saudi Arabia fell by more than half from the previous week to 442,000 barrels per day (bpd). This is the second lowest level in weekly data going back to 2010,"" ANZ bank said. Saudi Arabia is the de-facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which together with some non-OPEC producers, including Russia, announced supply cuts late last year aimed at tightening the market and propping up prices. U.S. sanctions imposed on state-oil firm Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) this week are also causing some supply disruptions. Venezuela's oil inventories have started to build up at the country's ports and terminals as PDVSA is finding it cannot export crude at its usual rate due to U.S. sanctions imposed earlier this week. As of Wednesday, Venezuela had 25 tankers with nearly 18 million barrels of crude - representing about two weeks of the country's production - either waiting to load or expecting authorisation to set sail, shipping data showed. Matt Stanley, a broker with Starfuels in Dubai, said the combination of U.S. sanctions against oil producers Venezuela and Iran, the OPEC-led supply cuts, as well as hopes that the trade dispute between the United States and China could soon be resolved meant oil prices would likely rise further. ""There are just too many factors that can only cause the price to go one way and that is up,"" Stanley said. Despite this, oil remains in ample supply, not least because of soaring U.S. crude oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA>, which jumped by more than 2 million bpd last year to a record 11.9 million bpd. This shows in high U.S. commercial crude oil stockpiles <C-STK-T-EIA>, which rose by 919,000 barrels in the week to Jan. 25, to 445.94 million barrels, EIA data showed. Stockpiles are 6.6 percent higher than a year ago.

2019-01-31,"Oil giant Royal Dutch Shell reported better-than-expected full-year earnings on Thursday, as deep cost cuts introduced after the 2014 energy market downturn filtered through. Full-year profits jumped 36 percent to $21.4 billion in 2018 — as cost savings helped the Anglo-Dutch company record its highest annual profits since 2014. Net income attributable to shareholders on a current cost of supplies (CCS) basis, used as a proxy for net profit, and excluding identified items, came in at $5.7 billion. This compared to a company-provided analyst consensus of $5.28 billion for the final three months of 2018, according to Reuters. ""Shell delivered a very strong financial performance in 2018, with cash flow from operations of $49.6 billion, excluding working capital movements,"" Royal Dutch Shell CEO Ben van Beurden, said in a statement published Thursday. ""We will continue with a strong delivery focus in 2019, with a disciplined approach to capital investment and growing both our cash flow and returns. Our strategy to deliver a world-class investment case is working,"" he added. A robust performance in the final three months of the year was underpinned by higher oil and gas prices, year-on-year, as well as a stronger contribution from liquefied natural gas (LNG) trading. Market participants saw large gains in energy shares over the first nine months of 2018 largely wiped out by a dramatic decline in crude futures in the fourth quarter. The value of a barrel of Brent crude soared to a four-year high of $86 a barrel in early October, before collapsing to around $50 within weeks. Crude futures have hovered around $60 a barrel so far this year. Shares of Shell rose more than 3.5 percent on Thursday morning.
