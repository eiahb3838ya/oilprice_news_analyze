2019-02-19,"A rolling oil pact between Russia and Saudi Arabia which seeks to support prices by reducing output looks to be on shaky ground with only the Arab nation appearing to fulfil its promises. Late last year, OPEC producing countries, and non-OPEC producers, led by Russia, agreed to cut supply by 1.2 million barrels per day(bpd), an arrangement known as OPEC+. Saudi Arabia agreed to account for the bulk of OPEC nation cuts and has confirmed it will drop its crude oil production by a further 400,000 barrels per day to 9.8 million b/d in March. If achieved it would mean that since the December, Saudi Arabia has become responsible for 70 percent of the total OPEC+ target. In turn, Russia was set to account for the greater share of non-OPEC cuts, but from October to the beginning of February had only decreased output by 47,000 barrels per day. The slow pace to cuts from Russian oil producers drew criticism from Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, who told CNBC in January that Moscow had moved ""slower than I'd like."" That barb led to a response from Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak who said at the beginning of February that Russia was ""completely fulfilling its obligations in line with earlier announced plans to gradually cut production by May this year."" During 2018, oil prices were dragged lower by increasing U.S. shale supply and fears over global demand. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized OPEC on its decision making, claiming prices should be lower. In November 2018 Trump tweeted that he hoped OPEC wouldnot cut oil output.

 On Tuesday International benchmark Brent crude was trading at $66.39 a barrel at around 12 p.m. London time (7 a.m ET), down around 0.1 percent, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) stood at $56.09, almost 1 percent higher. Oil prices have steadily edged higher since the OPEC+ promise to cut supply and are now sitting at levels not seen since November 2018. But Torbjorn Soltvedt, principal MENA politics analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, said in a note Tuesday that any end to Russian-Saudi coordination would likely add significant downward pressure on prices. ""Although our base case is still that Riyadh and Moscow find a compromise to extend the agreement, the pact is now looking more fragile than ever,"" said Soltvedt. The political analyst added that to save the pact he expected Saudi Arabia may even have to settle for ""low levels of (Russian) compliance to save the pact."" Verisk Maplecroft estimate that Riyadh needs $80 a barrel in order to fund its 2019 budget while in turn, Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed that $60 is enough to satisfy Moscow's needs. The next meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers takes place in mid-April.

2019-02-19,"Oil steadied on Tuesday after hitting 2019 highs as concerns about global crude oil demand, coupled with uncertainty over the latest round of U.S.-China trade talks, countered investor optimism around tightening supplies. Brent crude slipped 14 cents to $66.36 a barrel, after earlier hitting $66.65, close to its 2019 high of $66.83 reached on Monday. U.S. crude settled up 50 cents at $56.09 a barrel, maintaining its high for the year. ""I think the market is looking for an excuse to follow through on the breakout, but there are still a lot of questions surrounding the U.S.-China trade deal"" and the global economy, said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. A fresh round of talks aimed at resolving the trade dispute between the United States and China were scheduled to start on Tuesday in Washington, with higher-level discussions planned for later in the week. Traders said they were cautious about taking large new positions before the outcome of the talks. In a warning sign about the economic outlook, Europe's biggest bank HSBC warned it may delay some investments this year as it missed 2018 profit forecasts due to slowing growth in China and Britain. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last week lowered its forecast for growth in world oil demand in 2019 to 1.24 million barrels per day and some analysts believe it could be weaker still. ""Given a continuously uncertain economic picture, our already relatively bearish outlook for 2019 of below 1 million bpd in global oil demand growth may be subject to further downwards revisions,"" analysts at JBC Energy wrote. To stop a build-up of inventories that could weigh on prices, the group of OPEC and allies like Russia, known as OPEC+, began a new supply cut of 1.2 million bpd on Jan. 1. The cuts have helped crude to rise more than 20 percent this year. In keeping with that aim, Russian President Vladimir Putin and King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de facto leader, said they supported continued coordination on the global energy markets, the Kremlin said on Tuesday. The statement eased some doubts that Russia would stick to the pact, investors said. U.S. sanctions against exporters Iran and Venezuela have provided additional support to the market. Venezuela is a major crude supplier to U.S. refineries. Iran's exports, while down steeply since the sanctions began in November, have risen in early 2019, according to tanker data and sources.
