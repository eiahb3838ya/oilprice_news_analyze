2019-01-21,"SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Tuesday as signs of a spreading global economic slowdown stoked concerns over future fuel demand. International Brent crude oil futures were at $62.26 per barrel at 0410 GMT, down 48 cents, or 0.8 percent, from their previous close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $53.44 per barrel, down 0.7 percent, or 36 cents. China on Monday reported its lowest economic growth figure since 1990, with GDP rising by 6.6 percent in 2018. ""Slowing manufacturing activity in China is likely weighing on demand,"" said Singapore-based tanker brokerage Eastport on Tuesday, adding that industrial slowdowns tended to be leading indicators that only gradually fed into lower demand for shipped oil products. In a sign of spreading economic weakness, South Korea's export-oriented economy slowed to a six-year low growth rate of 2.7 percent in 2018, official data showed on Tuesday. This followed the International Monetary Fund on Monday trimming its 2019 global growth forecasts to 3.5 percent, down from 3.7 percent in last October's outlook. ""After two years of solid expansion, the world economy is growing more slowly than expected and risks are rising,"" IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told reporters. Despite the darkening outlook, oil prices have been getting some support from supply cuts that started in late 2018 by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). ""The effects of OPEC-led cuts ... will undoubtedly place a price floor under crude oil,"" said Singapore-based brokerage Phillip Futures on Tuesday.

There also seems to be a general belief that the agreed cut in OPEC+ production will be sufficient to balance the market,"" PVM Oil Associates said in a note.

2019-01-21,"The Middle East's largest public company is expanding its investments in China despite an expected slowdown in the country's economic growth, its CEO said Monday. Speaking to CNBC during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Yousef Al-Benyan, chief executive of Saudi Arabian petrochemicals manufacturer SABIC, dismissed growing concerns about the future of the world's second-largest economy. ""If you are a long-term player I think this is normal in any economy, they have to go through sometimes a bumpy road. And that is, I think, what we experienced with China today,"" Al-Benyan told CNBC's Hadley Gamble, referencing the ongoing trade war between China and the U.S. That, he said, ""has really influenced some of the growth we expect out of China, but from a SABIC perspective we look at China as long term,"" he said. Investors and analysts have raised concern over China's growth outlook, which has been dampened by weakened domestic demand and the trade war with Washington that's hit exports. A recent Reuters poll found that the country's growth is expected to slow to 6.3 percent this year from an expected 6.6 percent in 2018, which would be the lowest in 29 years. That figure was 6.9 percent in 2017. But SABIC, which is also the fourth-largest petrochemicals producer in the world, plans to keep investing in China. ""I think Asia is growing and China is really driving this growth,"" Al-Benyan said. ""That is why we have improved our presence in China specifically, we are trying to put even more investment in China because we think the growth is there.""
