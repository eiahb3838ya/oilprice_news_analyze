The views expressed are his own) LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers show signs of having completed their recent sale of crude and refined fuels, with positions edging up slightly in the first week of the new year, amid hopes a recession can be averted. Oil prices have bounced off their recent lows, the U.S. dollar has weakened against most other major currencies and expectations of a trade deal between the United States and China are rising. Portfolio managers raised their net long position in ICE Brent crude futures and options by 6 million barrels to 158 million barrels in the week to Jan. 8. Funds also boosted their net long position in European gasoil by 3 million barrels to a total of 5 million barrels, according to exchange data. Net long positions in Brent and gasoil remain close to multi-year lows and increases since the start of the year have been very small. But the heavy fund selling in crude and refined fuels reported during the fourth quarter appears to have ended, at least for now (https://tmsnrt.rs/2HcppoW). The completion of fund sales has been enough to help oil prices bounce off their recent lows as at least a few short positions have been covered. Fund managers have essentially squared their positions in crude and fuels and are remaining on the sidelines until the economic outlook becomes clearer. There are three main scenarios for the global economy this year: resumption of strong growth; an extended soft patch; or a slump into recession. In the first scenario, crude and fuel prices will likely rise, while in the second and third they are likely to remain around current levels or fall further. Fund managers cautious positioning in oil suggests they see roughly equal probabilities for all three outcomes at present.

2019-01-14,"Natural gas prices spiked on Monday as the market gained confidence that the severe cold gripping the United States will persist longer than previously thought, driving up heating demand and taxing gas stockpiles. Front-month Henry Hub natural gas futures for February rose more than 13 percent on Monday. The contract hit a session peak at $3.539 per million British thermal units, its highest level since Dec. 27. The contract was last up 12.7 percent at $3.493 per mmBtu.  Updated forecasts show below-average temperatures persisting over the next two weeks, with the cold snap drifting eastward from the Midwest toward the East Coast. Traders were anticipating the cold would linger, but weather models available last week didn't give them the confidence to take long positions in natural gas futures heading into the weekend, according to Jacob Meisel, chief weather analyst at Bespoke Weather Services. ""The forecast has turned significantly colder,"" he said. ""It's really the magnitude of the cold and the confidence in severity longer term that's changed over the weekend."" ""There is surprisingly strong agreement even late in the week two forecast."" 6-10 day forecast, source: National Weather Service  8-14 day forecast, source: National Weather Service  Natural gas prices have been falling since the middle of December, following a spike above $4 per mmBtu in the fall. Hotter-than-usual late summer temperatures and a surprisingly cold fall increased demand for cooling and heating last year, causing natural gas stockpiles to fall to their lowest level in over a decade. Stockpile levels have improved after a warm second half of December, but a prolonged cold period will put renewed pressure on inventories and bid up gas prices, says Meisel. It's currently unlikely the cold will last long enough or be strong enough to push inventories toward record lows, but another move above $4 per mmBtu remains a risk. ""You would need to really sustain this cold through at least a third or half of February in order to get $4, even though we've made great progress in the five-year storage deficit over the last month,"" said Meisel. ""I still wouldn't rule out $4 if the cold lasts long enough."" With natural gas inventories still 15 percent below the five-year average, investment bank Barclays sees room for higher prices even if weather normalizes during the rest of winter. Barclays is currently forecasting Henry Hub prices to average $3.51 per mmBtu in the first quarter and $2.92 per mmBtu for the full year. ""The market had seemingly written off a return to cold weather during the downturn of the last six weeks or so, and today's price action is a good reminder that there's still a lot of winter left,"" said Sam Phillips, vice president for global gas and energy at Barclays.

2019-01-14,"The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) awarded Italy's ENI and Thailand's PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP) two offshore exploration blocks, covering a combined area of more than 8,000 square kilometers. The blocks, called Offshore 1 and Offshore 2 in the emirate's northwest, are the first to be awarded among the areas ADNOC offered for commercial bidding as part of Abu Dhabi's first-ever competitive open block licensing round that began in April 2018. Under the agreement, Eni will operate the areas and PTTEP and Eni will invest at least $230 million for oil and gas exploration. The two companies will both hold a 100 percent stake in the exploration phase. ADNOC has the option to hold a 60 percent stake in the production phase, following any commercial discovery. The concession agreements were signed by ADNOC CEO Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi and PTTEP President and CEO Phongsthorn Thavisin over the weekend during the Atlantic Council Global Energy Forum in Abu Dhabi. ""With this agreement we are all excited because it's the first ever time we've come into the UAE (United Arab Emirates),"" Thavisin told CNBC after the signing. He described his company as primarily focused on Southeast Asia but with key interests in the Middle east, particularly Oman and the UAE. And he expressed his optimism on working with Eni, which he called a ""world class"" company and global leader in exploration. ""To gain the confidence and trust from ADNOC, the combination between an IOC (international oil company) like Eni and NOC (national oil company) like ADNOC would really lift us a bit also.""

2019-01-14," Oil prices fell on Monday after data showed weakening imports and exports in China, the world's second-largest oil consumer, raising the prospect of a slowdown in fuel demand. China's exports fell by the most in two years in December while imports contracted, official figures showed, pointing to further weakness in what is also the world's second-largest economy. Monday's losses accelerated sharply heading into the settlement for major crude benchmarks. Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell $1.48, or 2.5 percent, to $59 a barrel around 2:30 p.m. ET, trading as low as $59.37 intraday. U.S. crude ended Monday's session down $1.08, or 2.1 percent, at $50.51. ""Both imports and exports disappointed expectations and are set to revive fears about a global growth slowdown,"" said Norbert Ruecker, head of macro and commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer.
