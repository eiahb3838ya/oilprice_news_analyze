2019-01-08,"SINGAPORE, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Wednesday, extending gains from the previous session on hopes that Washington and Beijing can resolve a trade dispute that has triggered a global economic slowdown. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $50.29 per barrel as at 0131, up 51 cents, or 1 percent from their last settlement. It was the first time this year that WTI has topped $50 a barrel. International Brent crude futures were up 42 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $59.14 per barrel. Both crude price benchmarks had already gained more than 2 percent in the previous session. ""Crude continues to extend gains as early reports from Beijing regarding trade negotiations are fueling optimism around successful trade talks between the U.S. and China,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore. ""After a dreadful December for risk markets, Crude oil continues to catch a positive vibe,"" he added. The world's two biggest economies will continue trade talks in Beijing for an unscheduled third day on Wednesday, U.S. officials said, amid signs of progress on issues including purchases of U.S. farm and energy commodities and increased U.S. access to China's markets. State newspaper China Daily said on Wednesday that Beijing is keen to put an end to its trade dispute with the United States, but that it will not make any ""unreasonable concessions"" and that any agreement must involve compromise on both sides. If no deal is reached by March 2, Trump has said he will proceed with raising tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports at a time when China's economy is slowing significantly. Oil prices have also been receiving support from supply cuts started at the end of 2018 by a group of producers around the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as well as non-OPEC member Russia.

2019-01-08,"With 28 countries and a combined population of around 512 million people, the European Union is something of a prized market — and political battleground — for the world's largest energy exporters, particularly when it comes to natural gas. Russia has long been the dominant source and supplier of natural gas to Europe's mass market but the U.S. is looking to challenge Russia by stepping up its imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) — gas which is super-cooled to liquid form — making it easier and safer to store and transport. Europe certainly appears keen to wean itself off Russian gas, and all the geopolitical implications that reliance entails, while making overtures to the U.S. Last July, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and President Donald Trump agreed to strengthen U.S.-EU strategic cooperation with respect to energy and the EU said it would import more LNG from the U.S. ""to diversify and render its energy supply more secure."" Twenty-four percent of U.S. LNG went to the EU in October 2018, a month which saw the largest volume ever of EU-U.S. trade in LNG of almost 0.6 billion cubic meters. In the whole of 2017, only 10 percent of U.S. LNG exports went to the EU. The Commission, the EU's executive arm, expects U.S. gas exports to the region could double by 2022 and has vaunted the construction of LNG terminals across Europe. ""The fact is that U.S. LNG, if priced competitively, can play and increasing role in EU gas supply, enhancing diversification and EU energy security,"" the EU said in a document detailing the state of EU-U.S. LNG trade in late November.

2019-01-08,"looms@ SINGAPORE, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Oil prices were stable on Tuesday, supported by hopes that talks in Beijing between U.S. and Chinese officials might defuse trade disputes between the world's biggest economies, while OPEC-led supply cuts also tightened markets. International Brent crude futures were at $57.42 per barrel at 0742 GMT, up 9 cents, or 0.2 percent from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $48.56 per barrel, up 4 cents, or 0.1 percent. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Monday that Beijing and Washington could reach a trade deal that ""we can live with"" as dozens of officials from China and the United States held talks in a bid to end a trade spat that has roiled global markets since last year. Despite optimism around the talks in Beijing, some analysts warned that the relationship between Washington and Beijing remained on shaky grounds, and that tensions could flare up again soon. ""We remain concerned about the world's most important bilateral relationship,"" political risk consultancy Eurasia Group said in its 2019 outlook. ""The U.S. political establishment believes engagement with Beijing is no longer working, and it's embracing an openly confrontational approach...(and) rising nationalist sentiment makes it unlikely that Beijing will ignore U.S. provocations,"" Eurasia Group said.

""Our lower oil price assumptions reflect slowing demand and rising supply globally,"" said S&P Global Ratings analyst Danny Huang. OPEC VS SHALE Looking at oil supplies, 2019 crude prices have been supported by supply cuts from a group of producers around the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as well as non-OPEC member Russia. ""Crude oil prices have benefited from OPEC production cuts and steadying equities markets,"" said Mithun Fernando, investment analyst at Australia's Rivkin Securities. Looming over the OPEC-led cuts, however, is a surge in U.S. oil supply, driven by a steep rise in onshore shale oil drilling and production. As a result, U.S. crude oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA> rose by a whopping 2 million barrels per day (bpd) last year to a world record 11.7 million bpd.
