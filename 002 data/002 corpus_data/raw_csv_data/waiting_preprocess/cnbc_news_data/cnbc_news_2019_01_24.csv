2019-01-24,"SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose by more than one percent on Friday as turmoil in Venezuela triggered concerns that its oil exports could soon be disrupted. Washington on Thursday signaled it could impose sanctions on Venezuela's crude exports as Caracas descends further into political and economic turmoil. International Brent crude oil futures were at $61.89 a barrel at 0246 GMT, 80 cents, or 1.3 percent, above their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $53.90 per barrel, up 77 cents, or 1.5 percent. Amid violent street protests, Venezuela's opposition leader Juan Guaido declared himself interim president earlier this week, winning backing from Washington and large parts of Latin America, prompting Nicolas Maduro, the country's leader since 2013, to break relations with the United States. Fundamentally, however, global oil markets are still well supplied, thanks in part to surging output in the United States, where crude production rose by more than 2 million barrels per day (bpd) last year to a record 11.9 million bpd. Record U.S. production would likely offset any short-term disruptions to Venezuelan supply due to possible U.S. sanctions, Britain's Barclays on Thursday said in a note. The bank cut its 2019 average Brent crude oil forecast to $70 a barrel, down from $72 previously. The surge in U.S. output has resulted in swelling U.S. fuel inventories. Gasoline stocks rose for an eighth consecutive week in the week to Jan. 18, by 4.1 million barrels to a record 259.6 million barrels, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in a weekly report on Thursday. Crude inventories rose by 8 million barrels.

2019-01-24,"Oil prices should sit around the $60 to $80 a barrel range throughout 2019 with volatility set to remain in the energy markets, Crescent Petroleum's chief executive told CNBC Thursday. Speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Majid Jafar, CEO of the United Arab Emirates-based oil and natural gas producer, said prices were subject to huge fluctuations and predicting prices was as hard as it had ever been. ""(Prices are) the most volatile in 30 years. That's partly because of certain tweets but also because there isn't much spare capacity and that's where you see volatility,"" he said. Jafar said he remained optimistic of a trade deal between the U.S and China and that the global economy was still growing ""pretty well."" The CEO said that should provide a decent base for oil prices across the 2019 calendar year. ""It will be in this $60 to $80 range. It will be volatile, but $90 is more likely than $40,"" he said. Oil prices steadied on Thursday as fears over the global economic outlook checked any price rises coming from a U.S. threat of sanctions on OPEC member Venezuela. Brent crude futures traded at $60.99 a barrel at around 3:36 p.m. GMT (10:36 a.m. ET) while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures sat at $52.72.

2019-01-24,"The boom in U.S. oil and natural gas production will make the U.S. a net energy exporter in 2020 — a feat the country has not achieved in nearly 70 years, the Department of Energy's statistics bureau said on Thursday. The U.S. will start exporting more energy products than it imports as U.S. crude output continues to grow and domestic oil consumption declines, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its latest Annual Energy Outlook. Growing shipments of natural gas and petroleum byproducts will also boost the country's role as a major energy exporter. The report, which makes projections for the next 50 years, marks the latest revision to EIA's timeline for the U.S. to become more energy independent. Last year, EIA forecast the U.S. would become a net exporter by 2022. In 2017, it said the nation would achieve the status in 2026.  Last week, EIA said the U.S. will start exporting more crude oil and petroleum products than it imports by the final quarter of 2020. After that it would remain a net oil exporter for years to come. Towards the end of its 50-year forecast period, EIA expects the U.S. to once again start importing more petroleum products than it exports, as economic growth fuels demand for gasoline. EIA expects U.S. oil production to continue setting new records each year for nearly another decade. The bureau sees American oil output hitting a new annual high through 2027, when booming production starts to level off. Last year, the nation's drillers pumped an average 10.9 million barrels a day, breaking the annual record going back to 1970. Once production cracks 14 million barrels a day in the coming years, EIA expects the U.S. output to stay above that level through 2040. Most of the growth will come from U.S. shale fields, where drillers use advanced methods to free oil and gas from rock formations. The shale drilling will also support a rise in natural gas liquids production, which yields byproducts like ethane, propane and butane. These NGLs are used to make a wide range of products and chemicals, including plastics. EIA says NGL output could account for about a third of total liquids production through 2050. The U.S. became a net exporter of natural gas in 2017, and EIA sees low gas prices encouraging adoption of the fuel across a number of sectors. EIA expects U.S. natural gas shipments to continue growing, driven by exports of liquefied natural gas, a form of the fuel chilled to liquid form for transport by sea. The country will remain a net coal exporter through 2050, but EIA does not see shipments growing due to competition from other nations better positioned to serve big importers.

2019-01-24,"(For a live blog on European stocks, type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window) Jan 24 (Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 was lower in early trade on Thursday, underperforming its European peers, as weaker crude prices dragged oil majors lower and telecom Vodafone and pest control company Rentokil were hurt by weak sector earnings. On track for its third straight session of losses, the FTSE 100 was 0.3 percent lower while the FTSE 250 was up 0.1 percent at 0908 GMT. At the bottom of the main index, telecom operator Vodafone lost 3.5 percent at its lowest since November after its South African unit reported a slowdown in service revenue growth. It was the biggest drag on the blue chips. Heavyweight oil stocks were down 0.4 percent due to lower crude prices on lingering concerns about slowing global economic growth. Rentokil was also among big fallers, sliding 3 percent after U.S. peer Rollins' results missed Wall Street expectations. Consumer goods maker Reckitt Benckiser fell 2.5 percent to a more than six-month low as Jefferies downgraded the stock in the wake of the departure of its longstanding CEO. ""The surprise retirement of CEO Rakesh Kapoor crystallises long-brewing anxieties around RB's predicament. There are strong runners and riders for the role aplenty. But this is a challenge beyond mere fresh legs,"" Jefferies analyst said. But equipment rental company Ashtead added nearly 2 percent and outperformed the index after NYSE-listed rival United Rentals reported a jump in rental revenue. Results also drove midcap shares. Frankie & Benny's owner Restaurant Group was the top faller, down as much as 3 percent after predicting lower full-year like-for-like sales. Among other moves, Just Eat added 2.6 percent after a JP Morgan upgrade while homebuilder Crest Nicholson shed 3.1 percent, with a trader citing a rating downgrade. Trading platform CMC Markets rose 2.6 percent after it said the Sino-U.S. trade tensions boosted client activity on its online trade platform in the third quarter. AIM-listed tonic water maker Fevertree jumped 10 percent on track for its best day in more than 14 months after guiding to almost 40 percent surge in full-year revenue.

2019-01-24,"Global oil markets are facing an uncertain year with slowing global growth driving less global demand for oil while the supply picture looks unclear with production cuts by OPEC and Russia potentially counteracted by the growth in U.S. shale oil output. But it's not supply, demand, sanctions on Iran's oil industry or political upheaval in oil producer Venezuela that the chief executive of Total is worried about. ""The main risk for the oil market is the situation in the Middle East because this is the big area of production, not only in Saudi Arabia but in the UAE and Kuwait. There's Iraq and Iran and this region is connected,"" Total's Patrick Pouyanné told CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Thursday.  ""And it's clear that the events of the last quarter of the year around Saudi Arabia and Iran which are the two big blocs there, have worried a lot of people so there is purely a premium risk. Having said that, we shouldn't overestimate it, there is also the supply and demand (factor),"" he said. ""Yes, demand is strong but supply is also going very strong with U.S. shale.""

2019-01-24,"slows@ (Adds comment, updates prices) SINGAPORE, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Oil prices declined on Thursday on lingering concerns that slowing global economic growth may limit fuel demand and after a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories. International Brent crude oil futures were at $60.85 a barrel at 0627 GMT, down 29 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last settlement. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $52.37 per barrel, 25 cents lower from their last close. ""The crude market is now focussing on global growth concerns primarily ... It looks to be viewing inventory readings (as) secondary,"" said Hue Frame, portfolio manager at Frame Funds in Sydney. ""The IMF downgrading 2019/20 and the continued rhetoric from Davos reiterating that they expect global growth to slow down over the next two years is providing selling pressure in oil,"" Frame said. Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cut its world economic growth forecasts for 2019 and 2020, due to weakness in Europe and some emerging markets. World leaders and top executives are meanwhile meeting in Davos, Switzerland, to discuss how to steer policy amid worries of slowing economic growth, damaging trade wars and Brexit. Oil market sentiment was also weakened by a surprise increase in U.S. crude inventories after refineries cut output, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed on Wednesday. Crude inventories rose by 6.6 million barrels in the week ended on Jan. 18 to 443.6 million barrels, compared with analyst expectations for a decrease of 42,000 barrels, the API said. Refinery runs fell by 152,000 barrels per day. The United States has overtaken Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world's biggest crude producer with production levels approaching 12 million barrels per day (bpd). But U.S. oil producers told the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Wednesday that investors in U.S. oil companies wanted a reduction in growth and higher payouts. The bosses of U.S. companies Occidental Petroleum and Hess Corp, attending a session at the World Economic Forum in Davos, said growth in U.S. shale oil output would slow. OPEC and its non-OPEC allies including Russia have cut output since 2017 to support oil prices. ""Sharp production cuts by OPEC+ have kept crude oil futures supported, however, as market reports indicate for a marked output reduction in Dec 2018,"" said Benjamin Lu, analyst at Phillip Futures. ""Though oil prices have demonstrated for higher upside potential in the first quarter of 2019, mounting economic challenges will continue to impede exponential gains in the longer term,"" Lu said.
