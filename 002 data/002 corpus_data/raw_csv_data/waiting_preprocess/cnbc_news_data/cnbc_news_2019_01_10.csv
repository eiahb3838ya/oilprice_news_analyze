2019-01-10,"SINGAPORE, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped on Friday as concerns over economic growth were rekindled after talks fell short of offering concrete steps to end the Sino-U.S. trade conflict, although OPEC-led production cuts bolstered sentiment in crude markets. Oil prices were also supported by comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday that the central bank had the ability to be patient on monetary policy. International Brent crude futures were at $61.22 per barrel at 0139 GMT, down 46 cents, or 0.75 percent, from their last close. However, Brent remains on track for a second consecutive week of gains as it is up about 7 percent so far this week. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures dropped 34 cents, or 0.65 percent, to $52.25 per barrel. WTI has climbed 9 percent this week, its biggest weekly rise since December, 2016. China said three days of talks with the United States that wrapped up on Wednesday had established a ""foundation"" to resolve differences over trade. But it gave few details on key issues at stake, including a scheduled U.S. tariff increase on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. A partial U.S. government shutdown and tepid economic data in some countries also dragged on broad financial markets. ""If we experience an economic slowdown, crude will underperform due to its correlation to growth,"" said Hue Frame, portfolio manager at Frame Funds in Sydney. ""China and the U.S. managing to agree on a positive deal would favor further risk-on sentiment within markets over the short-term. However, it is becoming more difficult to look past the weak readings of global manufacturing."" China's producer prices in December rose at their slowest pace in more than two years, a worrying sign of deflationary risks that could see Beijing roll out more policy support to help stabilize the economy. ""However, investors are becoming increasingly confident that OPEC+ production cuts will balance the market,"" ANZ Bank said on Friday. Saudi Arabia said earlier this week that supply curbs started in late 2018 by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producers including Russia, would bring the oil market into balance. ""We believe further price appreciation will occur during 2019, although the year will be marked with continued volatility,"" analysts at Fitch Solutions said on Friday. ""The main factors we believe that will support higher prices are the winding down of sanction waivers for Iran and continued strong demand growth from emerging markets outside of China."" Asia's Iranian oil imports were set to rise from December onwards as the United States granted temporary waivers to some countries from sanctions against Iran's oil exports. The waivers are due to expire around the start of May. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Thursday that the U.S. sanctions against his country were ""fully illegal"" and Tehran would not comply with them.

2019-01-10,"SINGAPORE, Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices edged down on Friday as concerns over economic growth were rekindled after talks fell short of offering concrete steps to end the Sino-U.S. trade conflict, although OPEC-led production cuts bolstered sentiment in crude markets. Oil prices were also supported by comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday that the central bank had the ability to be patient on monetary policy. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures had slipped 23 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last settlement to $52.36 per barrel by 0016 GMT. However, U.S. crude was on track for a second consecutive week of gains and its largest weekly percentage increase in more than two years. WTI has climbed about 9 percent so far this week, its biggest weekly rise since December, 2016. International Brent crude futures had yet to trade. China said three days of talks with the United States that wrapped up on Wednesday had established a ""foundation"" to resolve differences over trade. But it gave few details on key issues at stake, including a scheduled U.S. tariff increase on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. A partial U.S. government shutdown and tepid economic data in some countries also dragged on broad financial markets. ""The U.S. government shutdown and weak retail sales figures around the world reinvigorated concerns about (economic) growth,"" analysts at ANZ bank said in a note on Friday.

""Saudi is turning the screws on export supply in order to re-balance the market in their favor. Prices are maintaining highs which suggests that the recent bullish move is not yet over,"" said Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Probis Securities in Sydney. ""We expect more bullish rhetoric from OPEC, especially from Saudi Arabia to help shore up the prices. U.S. producers will just enjoy the rise."" The likelihood of supply curbs elsewhere also helped buoy oil markets. Norway's oil industry regulator said the country's crude output in 2019 would be smaller than previously forecast and at its lowest level in three decades. Meanwhile, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Thursday U.S. sanctions against his country were ""fully illegal"" and Tehran would not comply with them.

2019-01-10,"(Adds details on budget stabilization fund) MEXICO CITY, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Mexico completed its 2019 oil hedge, the world's largest sovereign derivatives trade, guaranteeing an average price of $55 per barrel for Mexican crude for the year after buying $1.23 billion in put options, the finance ministry said on Thursday. Mexico hedges its crude every year and deals are closely watched by the market since the trades are big enough to affect prices. The program is a longstanding part of Mexico's strategy for safeguarding oil revenues from market volatility. The government said it spent 23.49 billion pesos on put options, a financial instrument that sets an agreed price to sell assets around a specified date. It did not say how many barrels of crude were covered by the trade. ""With these actions we protect that budget ... against drops in prices of oil below this level,"" the finance ministry said in a statement. The ministry said that between the put options and resources in a budget stabilization fund, they could assure an average price of $55 per barrel for Mexican crude exports during 2019. The fund had 246.7 billion pesos ($12.90 billion) at the end of the third quarter last year, according to the 2019 budget proposal. For more than a decade, Mexicos government has paid for a hedge in a bid to guarantee its revenues from oil exports by state company Pemex. The program is seen as the worlds top sovereign derivatives trade.

2019-01-10,"NEW YORK, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Crude prices edged higher on Thursday, supported by comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve chairman that lifted equity markets, but a more than week-long oil rally slowed as optimism surrounding U.S.-China trade talks faded. Brent crude futures rose 24 cents, or 0.4 percent, to settle at $61.68 a barrel. The global benchmark posted its first consecutive nine-day winning streak since September 2007. West Texas Intermediate crude ended 23 cents, or 0.4 percent, higher at $52.59 a barrel, also its ninth straight day of gains, that beats a 2010 record. Earlier in the session, both benchmarks hit their highest in nearly a month. WTI hit a session high of $52.78 per barrel and Brent rose to $61.91 a barrel. Global financial markets have climbed recently on hopes that Washington and Beijing would avert an all-out trade war. The two superpowers concluded three days of talks on Wednesday. But the rise in global markets began to dwindle after the world's two largest economies issued vaguely positive statements that lacked concrete details. Comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday helped boost riskier asset classes, including oil, late in the session. Powell said the U.S. central bank had the ability to be patient on policy, but that the Fed would shed significantly more assets than it already has. ""It was a mixed message from him, but I think it was sufficiently accommodative,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management. ""It's a continuation of that shift towards easier policies and more assistance to the underlying economy which helped boost crude oil prices."" U.S. equity markets broadly rose after the comments. Recently crude futures have tracked closely with Wall Street. However, investors remained worried about a potential slowdown in the global economy, with disappointing data from China overnight adding to concerns. China's producer prices in December rose at their slowest pace in more than two years, a worrying sign of deflationary risks. Market participants also were paying close attention to global crude supply, particularly a shale boom in the United States. U.S. crude oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA> has held around a record high of 11.7 million barrels per day since early November, according to government data. To counter rising U.S. output, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, reached a deal to rein in supply that officially began in January. Barclays forecast that Brent will remain range bound at $55 to $65 per barrel as inventories build in the coming months, while it expects ""the market will return to a balanced state"" by the second half of 2019. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Thursday U.S. sanctions against his country were ""fully illegal"" and Tehran would not comply with them. The OPEC deal had hung in the balance on concerns that Iran, whose crude exports have been depleted by U.S. sanctions, would receive no exemption and block the agreement.

2019-01-10,"Saudi oil giant Aramco is undertaking a series of moves that may pave the way for a long-delayed stock market debut. The kingdom plans an initial public offering for Aramco in 2021, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said during a news conference Wednesday. Falih backed the latest target for the IPO with several announcements that would essentially prep the market for the debut, which is expected to be the largest ever. Saudi Arabia on Wednesday released the results of an independent audit that confirms the kingdom controls more than 260 billion barrels in oil reserves. The assessment makes the metrics behind the world's largest energy company — long the subject of skepticism — a bit less opaque to potential investors in Aramco. ""This certification underscores why every barrel we produce is the most profitable in the world, and why we believe Saudi Aramco is the world's most valuable company and indeed the world's most important,"" Falih said in a statement. Falih later announced Aramco will issue bonds in the second quarter of this year. In order to tap the debt market, Aramco will release additional financial information, offering a wider glimpse into a private company whose inner workings are a closely held secret.

2019-01-10,"Oil prices ticked higher on Thursday, extending a winning streak into a ninth session, with gains capped by the lack of any clear resolution to U.S.-China trade talks and weak Chinese economic data. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures ended Thursday's session up 23 cents at $52.59 per barrel. The modest gain was enough to push WTI to a five-week closing high. International Brent crude futures were up 30 cents, at $61.74 per barrel around 2:30 p.m. Both benchmarks rose by around 5 percent the previous day, capping off a week-long climb that marked oil's longest sustained rise since last summer.
