2019-01-09,"(Updates to close of U.S. markets) NEW YORK, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Stocks around the world extended recent gains and oil prices jumped on Wednesday on optimism the United States and China may be inching toward a trade deal, soothing fears of an all-out trade war and its possible impact on global growth. Heightened risk appetite boosted U.S. Treasury yields to the highest this year, while the U.S. dollar extended losses after minutes from a Dec. 18-19 Federal Reserve policy meeting showed many Fed policymakers said the central bank could be patient on future rate hikes. Delegations from China and the U.S. ended talks in Beijing on Wednesday amid signs of progress on issues including purchases of U.S. farm and energy commodities and increased access to China's markets. China has pledged to purchase ""a substantial amount"" of agricultural, energy and manufactured goods and services from the United States, the U.S. Trade Representative's office said on Wednesday. MSCI's all-country index climbed 1.03 percent for a fourth day of gains. That added to advances since last week in equity markets around the world, following a strong U.S. employment report and comments from the Federal Reserve chief that calmed worries U.S. interest rate hikes would hurt growth. A range of Fed policymakers said last month they could be patient about future interest rate increases and a few did not support the central bank's rate increase that month, minutes from their Dec. 18-19 policy meeting showed. On Wednesday, a clutch of Fed officials said they would be cautious about any further increases in interest rates so the central bank could assess growing risks to an otherwise-solid U.S. economic outlook. The U.S. stock market was supported by advances by technology and other trade-sensitive sectors. The benchmark S&P 500 index is up by about 10 percent from 20-month lows hit around Christmas. ""If you want to gauge how investors are viewing the trade talks, just watch tech, and semiconductors in particular,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 91.67 points, or 0.39 percent, to close at 23,879.12, the S&P 500 gained 10.55 points, or 0.41 percent, to end at 2,584.96 and the Nasdaq Composite added 60.08 points, or 0.87 percent, to finish at 6,957.08. The pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark closed up 0.53 percent, its highest close in nearly four weeks. Oil prices jumped, helped by the hopes of easing trade tensions between China and the U.S., while OPEC-led crude output cuts also provided support. Brent crude futures rose $2.72 to settle at $61.44 a barrel, a 4.6 percent gain. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose $2.58 to settle at $52.36 a barrel, a 5.2 percent gain. The dollar tumbled to its lowest level since October after the Fed expressed caution about future rate hikes, and as investors reduced safe-haven bets due to optimism about U.S.-China trade talks. ""It will probably be mid-year before the Fed excites hike prospects again,"" said Joseph Trevisani, senior analyst at FXStreet.com in New York. U.S. Treasury yields climbed to the highest this year, helped by improved risk appetite, but retreated following dovish commentary from Fed speakers and a strong 10-year note auction. Benchmark 10-year notes were last down 2/32 in price to yield 2.7225 percent after earlier rising to 2.747 percent, the highest since Dec. 28.

2019-01-09,"Saudi Arabia's massive oil and gas reserves are even bigger than previously reported, according to an outside assessment commissioned by the kingdom. The independent audit not only revised Saudi reserves higher, but may help put to rest skepticism over the nation's oil and gas wealth, which has persisted in some corners of the market for years. It also shows national oil giant Saudi Aramco is taking strides towards transparency as it continues to consider a stock market debut. On Wednesday, Saudi Energy Minister and Aramco Chairman Khalid al-Falih said the kingdom expects the initial public offering for Aramco to take place in 2021, following a delay. State-controlled Aramco had 263.1 billion barrels of oil waiting to be tapped at the end of 2017, according to Dallas-based petroleum consulting firm DeGolyer and MacNaughton. That is 2.2 billion barrels more than Aramco reported in its last annual review. Aramco's natural gas reserves total 319.5 trillion cubic feet, according to the audit. The company, which is not a major player in the gas market, previously reported 302.3 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves. Saudi Arabia has additional reserves in an area along the border with Kuwait that has sat idle due to a dispute between the neighbors. Including this so-called Neutral Zone, Saudi oil reserves total 268.5 billion barrels, DeGolyer and MacNaughton concluded. That compares with an earlier estimate of 266.3 billion barrels. The Saudis commissioned the audit as part of their plan to publicly list shares of Aramco, the world's largest energy company. The kingdom hoped to attract a $2 trillion valuation and raise $100 billion to underwrite Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's economic transformation plan, Vision 2030.

2019-01-09,"SINGAPORE, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose more than 1 percent on Wednesday, extending gains from the previous session on signs that Washington and Beijing may soon resolve a trade dispute that has cast a pall over the global economy. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $50.53 per barrel at 0459, up 75 cents, or 1.5 percent, from their last settlement. That marked the first time this year that WTI has topped $50 a barrel. International Brent crude futures were up 79 cents, or 1.3 percent, at $59.47 per barrel. Both crude price benchmarks had already gained more than 2 percent in the previous session. ""Crude continues to extend gains as early reports from Beijing regarding trade negotiations are fueling optimism around successful trade talks between the U.S. and China,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore. ""After a dreadful December for risk markets, crude oil continues to catch a positive vibe,"" Innes said. The oil price jumps were in line with Asian stock markets, which climbed to 3-1/2 week highs on Wednesday. Trade talks in Beijing between the world's two biggest economies entered a third day on Wednesday, amid signs of progress on issues including purchases of U.S. farm and energy commodities and increased U.S. access to China's markets. State newspaper China Daily said on Wednesday that Beijing is keen to put an end to its trade dispute with the United States, but that it will not make any ""unreasonable concessions"" and that any agreement must involve compromise on both sides. If no deal is reached by March 2, Trump has said he will proceed with raising tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports at a time when China's economy is slowing significantly. Citing the trade tensions, the World Bank expects global economic growth to slow to 2.9 percent in 2019 from 3 percent in 2018. ""At the beginning of 2018 the global economy was firing on all cylinders, but it lost speed during the year and the ride could get even bumpier in the year ahead,"" World Bank Chief Executive Officer Kristalina Georgieva said in a semi-annual report released late on Tuesday. More fundamentally, however, oil prices have been receiving support from supply cuts started at the end of 2018 by a group of producers around the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as well as non-OPEC member Russia.

2019-01-09,"Oil prices ripped higher on Wednesday, rebounding from a pullback on bearish U.S. stockpile data after Saudi Arabia reassured the market that its oil production and exports are falling sharply. The oil market also drew support from talks between the United States and China aimed at preventing an all-out trade war. The market fears the dispute between the world's two biggest economies could slow global growth and weigh on fuel demand. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude surged 5 percent to a nearly one-month high at $52.58 in late morning trade. The contract ended Wednesday's session up $2.58, or 5.2 percent, to $52.36. International benchmark Brent crude was up $2.55, or 4.3 percent, at $61.27 around 2:25 p.m. ET, after earlier rising as high as $61.58.  After tumbling more than 40 percent over nearly three months, oil prices have risen by about 17 percent during an eight-day rally. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih on Wednesday said the kingdom will meet its goal of reducing output to 10.2 million barrels per day this month. That is down about 900,000 bpd from record Saudi output in November. Saudi Arabia will export 7.2 million bpd in January and 7.1 million bpd in February, according to Falih. The comments offer further evidence that OPEC and its oil market allies, including Russia, are cutting production following an oil price collapse late last year. Led by Saudi Arabia, the producers have vowed to keep 1.2 million bpd off the market starting this month. Falih said he believes the production cuts will balance the market, but won't rule out taking further action if supply starts to outstrip demand again. ""The market's just really responded to some of the early evidence that they are cutting back,"" said John Kilduff, founding partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital. That is contributing to a macro rebound against the backdrop of a rising stock market and the U.S.-China trade talks, said Kilduff. U.S. and Chinese trade representatives extended talks scheduled for Monday and Tuesday into a third day, as the two sides reportedly made progress towards resolving their long-running trade dispute.
