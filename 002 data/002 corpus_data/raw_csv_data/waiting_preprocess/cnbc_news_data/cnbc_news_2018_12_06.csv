2018-12-06,"decision@ SINGAPORE, Dec 7 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices stabilised on Friday, buoyed by a fall in U.S. crude oil inventories, but sentiment remained weak as producer group OPEC postponed a final decision on output cuts, awaiting support from non-OPEC heavyweight Russia. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $51.61 per barrel at 0037 GMT, 12 cents above their last close. WTI was supported by drop in U.S. commercial crude inventories <C-STK-T-EIA>, which fell by 7.3 million barrels in the week to Nov. 30, to 443.16 million barrels International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. The stabilising prices came after crude slumped by almost 3 percent the previous day, with the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) ending a meeting at its headquarters in Vienna, Austria, on Thursday without announcing a decision to cut crude supply, instead preparing to debate the matter on Friday. Analysts still expect some form of supply reduction to be decided. ""We are beginning to witness the outline of the next iteration of production cuts, with OPEC conforming to cut its own production by around 1 million barrels per day, with the cartel lobbying non-OPEC members to contribute more,"" Japan's MUFG bank said in a note. Oil producers have been hit by a 30-percent plunge in crude prices since October as supply surges just as the demand outlook weakens amid a global economic slowdown. Oil output from the world's biggest producers - OPEC, Russia and the United States - has increased by 3.3 million bpd since the end of 2017, to 56.38 million bpd, meeting almost 60 percent of global consumption. <PRODN-TOTAL> <C-RU-OUT> <C-OUT-T-EIA> The increase alone is equivalent to the output of major OPEC producer the United Arab Emirates.

2018-12-06,"VIENNA, Dec 6 (Reuters) - OPEC tentatively agreed an oil output cut on Thursday but was waiting for a commitment from non-OPEC heavyweight Russia before deciding the exact volumes for a production reduction aimed at propping up crude prices, two sources from the group said. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak flew home from Vienna earlier for talks with President Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg. Novak returns to Austria's capital for discussions among Saudi-led OPEC and the group's allies on Friday. The price of crude has fallen almost a third since October but U.S. President Donald Trump has demanded the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries make oil even cheaper by refraining from output cuts. ""We still want Russia to cut as much as possible,"" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters as the OPEC meeting concluded without yielding concrete figures. ""I'm not confident but I hope to reach a deal ... Hopefully, he (Novak) will come tonight,"" Falih said. Possible output cuts by OPEC and its allies range from 0.5-1.5 million bpd. A reduction of 1 million bpd would be acceptable and so far was the main scenario, Falih said. Brent oil futures fell as much as 5 percent to below $59 per barrel on fears that there could be no deal but later recovered somewhat, trading down 3.5 percent at 1720 GMT. ""One million bpd may disappoint many. But should the cut be from a September or October baseline, rather than November, the net impact would be sufficient to limit storage builds,"" Greg Sharenow, executive vice-president for Pimco, said on the sidelines of the OPEC meeting. ""It is unlikely to spark a meaningful price rally, but also will not be so dire either. In many respects it is the middle road, which may be the optimal solution,"" said Sharenow, who helps manage a $15 billion commodities fund at the $1.77 trillion U.S. investment management firm. OPEC delegates have said the group and its allies could cut by 1 million bpd if Russia contributed 150,000 bpd of that reduction. If Russia contributed around 250,000 bpd, the overall cut could exceed 1.3 million bpd. Novak said on Thursday that Russia would find it harder to cut oil output in winter than other producers because of the cold weather. Oil prices have crashed as Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United Arab Emirates raised output since June after Trump called for higher production to offset lower exports from Iran, OPEC's third-largest producer. Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States have been vying for the position of top crude producer in recent years. The United States is not part of any output-limiting initiative due to its anti-trust legislation and fragmented oil industry. On Thursday, U.S. government figures showed the country had become a net exporter of crude oil and refined products for the first time on record, underscoring how the surge in production has altered the supply equation in world markets. TRUMP RAISES PRESSURE Iranian exports have plummeted after the United States imposed fresh sanctions on Tehran in November. But Washington gave sanctions waivers to some buyers of Iranian crude, further raising fears of an oil glut next year. ""Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The world does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!"" Trump wrote in a tweet on Wednesday. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Thursday he would support a cut as long as Iran did not need to reduce its own output. Iraqi Oil Minister Thamer Ghadhban said Iraq as OPEC's second-largest producer would support and join a cut. Possibly complicating any OPEC decision is the crisis around the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. Trump has backed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman despite calls from many U.S. politicians to impose stiff sanctions on Riyadh.

2018-12-06,"slide@ LONDON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Yields on top-rated German government bonds tumbled to new six-month lows on Thursday, as a global equity selloff and a renewed slide in oil prices sent investors scurrying for safe-haven assets. U.S. 10-year yields also slipped to three-month lows as traders scaled back expectations on the number of rate hikes the Federal Reserve might be able to deliver amid weakening economic data and trade conflict. In contrast, Italian bonds sold off and the gap between 10-year Italian and German bond yields widened around 20 basis points, as higher-risk assets weakened and sources said Italy's ruling League party was resisting cuts to the 2019 budget deficit. The dash for safety was triggered by the arrest of a top executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei which renewed concern about a U.S.-China trade conflict World stocks fell 2.5 percent. U.S. equities ceded all their gains for the year and a pan-European European equity index suffered a 3.3 percent loss. The gloom was exacerbated by a more than 4 percent drop in oil prices after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ended a key meeting with no decision on crude output. It will debate an output cut on Friday with other exporters. Against this backdrop, yields on higher-rated euro zone bonds fell across the board. In Germany, the bloc's benchmark bond issuer, long-dated yields fell more than four basis points to 0.224 percent, a six-month low. ""We are also scratching our heads about the level of German Bund yields, but it all depends on oil and stock markets right now,"" said Alexander Aldinger, a rate strategist at Bayerische Landesbank. Bund yields are at their lowest since a rout in Italian bond markets in May, reflecting trade tensions, the growth outlook and next week's key vote in the British parliament on Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal. Ten-year yields have fallen eight bps so far this week, putting them on track for the biggest weekly fall since late-October. The oil price fall adds to downward pressures on inflation in the single currency bloc. A long-term gauge of the market's euro zone inflation expectations fell back towards more than one-year lows hit recently. ""If the inflation outlook deteriorates that feeds back into ECB policy making,"" said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets. ""We don't think the ECB will be able to raise rates next year."" An inversion of the short-end of the U.S. government bond yield curve this week for the first time in a decade has also created some anxiety, since it could be a prelude to an inversion of the broader U.S. yield curve, viewed as an indicator of recession risks. France's 10-year bond yield fell to 0.65 percent , its lowest level since July. Finnish and Irish 10-year bond yields fell to their lowest since September. Elsewhere, Italy's bond market was unable to escape the broader selloff in risk assets, with short-dated two- and five-year yields rising as much as 18 bps on the day . The League will accept only a minor reduction to next year's budget deficit target of 2.4 percent, senior party sources said on Thursday, conceding little to Brussels, which says the plan breaks European Union public finance rules.

2018-12-06,"meeting@ SINGAPORE, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday as stock markets slid, but trading was tepid in the countdown to an OPEC-meeting expected to result in a supply cut aimed at draining a glut that has pulled down crude by 30 percent since October. International Brent crude oil futures were at $61.06 per barrel at 0619 GMT, down 50 cents, or 0.8 percent from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $52.29 per barrel, down 60 cents, or 1.1 percent.

The British bank said that it expected ""the global economy to slow over the next several quarters"" although it added that ""not one major economy is near recession.""
