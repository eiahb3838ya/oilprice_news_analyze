2018-12-16,"SINGAPORE, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Oil prices were largely steady on Monday after falling 2 percent in the previous session, but remained under pressure amid weaker growth in major economies and concerns about oversupply. International Brent crude oil futures were at $60.33 per barrel at 0423 GMT, up 5 cents, or 0.08 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $51.33 per barrel, up 13 cents, or 0.25 percent. Persistent growth in U.S. shale output continues to weigh on oil prices, while some analysts doubted that planned supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would be enough to rebalance markets. ""I don't believe OPEC cuts will work this time around with Qatar going out and Iran refusing to cut, while there's a big question mark when Russia will go to its agreed level,"" said Sukrit Vijayakar, director of oil consultancy Trifecta. ""Meanwhile, U.S. production will go on increasing. So the whole load will effectively be on Saudi Arabia, who is under severe pressure from Trump anyway."" OPEC and its Russia-led allies have agreed to curb output from January, in a move to be reviewed at a meeting in April. Saudi Arabia is OPEC's de facto leader. Meanwhile, increasing concerns about weakening growth in major markets such as China and Europe also dampened the mood in oil and other asset classes. Chinese oil refinery throughput in November fell from October, suggesting an easing in oil demand, while the country's industrial output rose the least in nearly three years as the economy continued to lose momentum. French business activity plunged unexpectedly into contraction this month, retreating at the fastest pace in over four years, while Germany's private sector expansion slowed to a four-year low in December.

2018-12-16,"SINGAPORE, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Oil prices climbed on Monday after U.S. drilling activity fell to its lowest level in about two months, but increasing concerns about weaker growth in major economies kept a lid on gains. International Brent crude oil futures were at $60.37 per barrel at 0134 GMT, up 9 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $51.44 per barrel, up 24 cents, or 0.5 percent. ""Oil is finding support as the drop in Baker Hughes rig counts points to a near-term slowdown in U.S. production,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore. U.S. drillers cut four oil rigs in the week to Dec. 14, pulling the total count to the lowest since mid-October at 873, General Electric Co's Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. <RIG-OL-USA-BHI> ""This, when combined with (expectations) Saudi Arabia is ... to cut exports to the United States to draw down inventory builds (there) should provide a short-term base despite global slowdown fears, which continue to resonate,"" Innes said. The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its Russia-led allies have agreed to curb output from January, in a move to be reviewed at a meeting in April. Saudi Arabia is OPEC's de facto leader. However, some analysts said that oil markets were expected to remain oversupplied in the near-term as the OPEC-led planned supply cuts would likely help in some rebalancing only by the second-half of next year.

2018-12-16,"SINGAPORE, Dec 17 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices edged up on Monday amid a fall in drilling activity in the United States, but lingering concerns about weaker economic growth in major economies kept a lid on gains.

International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. ""Despite OPEC and Russia agreeing to reduce oil production by a further 1.2 million barrels per day at the recent OPEC meeting, prices have fallen as the market awaits evidence that the cuts will balance the market,"" ANZ Bank said on Monday.

""Oil markets have been struggling for direction post-OPEC with traders reading between the headlines and watching U.S. inventory numbers to gauge shale output,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore.

2018-12-16,"Qatar's foreign minister expressed a host of grievances over his Gulf counterparts' regional activities on Sunday, calling out Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in particular — and not just for their blockade of his country. ""We cannot blame one country on the destabilization of the region right now because the situation which we are suffering from is the result of a series of policies of different countries,"" Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al Thani told CNBC's Hadley Gamble in Doha, when asked if Riyadh were to blame for increased turbulence in the Middle East. ""We are disagreeing with [Saudi Arabia] currently when they are blockading Qatar, when they continue the war on Yemen without reason, the way they kidnapped the Lebanese prime minister,"" the foreign minister said. But he did not limit his criticism to Saudi Arabia, which in 2017 spearheaded an economic and diplomatic blockade against Qatar over accusations Doha supports terrorism, something the Qataris deny. ""We disagree also with the Emiratis' policy when they go and supported brutal regimes, supported military coup in Libya, supported a destabilization in Somalia, supported the separation and division of Yemen. And it's just these policies which are destabilization.""
