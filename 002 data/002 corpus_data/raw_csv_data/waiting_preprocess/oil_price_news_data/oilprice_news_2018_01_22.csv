2018-01-22,"Last Friday, oil prices surpassed $70 per barrel. With OPEC’s decision to reduce oil production, oil prices continue their rise. While Iran’s oil minister stated in early January that OPEC has no interest in prices jumping over $60 per barrel, no major changes have yet come from OPEC, and market players continue to wonder what can cause the price rise to reverse.Some analysis, built on conventional market principles, sees the cause of this tension as ongoing conflict in the Middle East — these analysts now await a strong reaction from Russia to change trends. However, as the International Energy Agency (IEA) notes, the explanation may be more unconventional…Since oil prices surpassed $70 per barrel on Friday, much international analysis narrows the cause to tensions in the Middle East — or more precisely, Iraq’s decision to join OPEC’s agreement to rein in output and ongoing conflict. Jabbar Ali Hussein Al-Luiebi, Iraq’s oil minister, announced his country’s decision to join OPEC’s agreement with other suppliers to rein in output until the end of 2018. “The deal should continue,” he said. “The market now is stabilizing somehow, but it’s not yet stable.”googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Despite Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh previously stating that “members of OPEC are not keen on increased brent crude prices above $60 a barrel because of shale oil,"" so far no immediate policy shift came from OPEC on Friday before markets closed. Many analysts, putting the Middle East at the heart of the cause, also projected that tension and the Afrin operation might push prices up to $80 per barrel.Thus, raising questions about the foundation of this analysis is now important. Do we need to fear? If so, who or what can stop this price hike? Answers vary upon how seriously the shale revolution is taken, as seen in two expert interviews with Bloomberg this week.  Related: The World’s Most Innovative Gas FieldEd Morse, Citigroup’s global head of commodities research, told Bloomberg he doesn’t know how OPEC will react, but he seemed confident regarding Russia’s reaction. He expects Russia to call for a pause in the agreement during OPEC’s summer meeting, as rising oil prices are endangering the ruble, and the Russian Central Bank is already considering an intervention.However, the IEA’s 2017 World Energy Outlook projected that China will overtake the United States as the world’s largest oil consumer around 2030, as well as predicting the U.S. shale revolution will turn the country toward export, making the U.S. a net oil exporter by 2020. That said, the IEA estimates prices for oil will remain in the $50–70/barrel range — suggesting that, even if the U.S. does become an energy exporter (as predicted), this will not be a game-changer for the U.S. economy.Based on that projection, in his Bloomberg interview, IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol drew attention to the fact that OPEC’s decisions today have a different nature than they did before the shale revolution. This is the new game in town, he noted.Indeed, Birol’s comment is clear. Growing U.S. shale production will push down oil prices over the long term. The countries who did not see this happening, such as Russia, now face severe economic challenges. The time of blaming Middle East conflicts for oil price fluctuations or passively expecting a Russian reaction seems to be ending, and it’s time to begin replacing traditional energy analyses with unconventional ones.It looks like the shale revolution — not Russian intervention or OPEC strategy — will be what ultimately causes prices to reverse.By Olgu Okumus for Oilprice.com",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Will-This-Cause-An-Oil-Price-Reversal.html,"Jan 22, 2018 at 16:50 | Olgu Okumus","Jan 22, 2018",Will This Cause An Oil Price Reversal?
2018-01-22,"BoomtownLast week, my day job took me to the Permian Basin. A colleague and I arrived late at night at our hotel in Fort Stockton, Texas. The hotel parking lot was full. The vehicles in the parking lot represented every type of oilfield-related business imaginable.At the front desk, I was told that the hotel had overbooked us. So, we had to search for new accommodations at 11 p.m., but every hotel parking lot in town was full.After an hour of searching, we finally located a pair of the last rooms in town. The carpet in my room smelled like crude oil, but I was happy to have a bed for the night.That’s the way it goes in the Permian these days. In fact, I heard someone say that if you can’t make money in the Permian right now, you aren’t trying.A Century of ProductionAfter the oil price crash that began in mid-2014, crude oil production growth in the U.S. stalled. In 2016, annual production in the Bakken and Eagle Ford formations fell by 10-20 percent, but production in the Permian Basin continued to grow.Amazingly, the Permian is approaching a century of oil production. At present, production has reached a record 2.8 million barrels per day (BPD), making it the world’s second-most-prolific field, behind the legendary Ghawar in Saudi Arabia.(Click to enlarge)Permian Basin production is nearing 3 million BPD.The Texas side of the Permian has already produced 30 billion barrels of crude and 75 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of natural gas. Since 2012, Permian Basin production has increased by nearly 2 million BPD – which is a larger increase than any other oilfield in the world. This is why I consider the Permian Basin to be the world’s hottest oil play.The Sand MenIt’s been two years since I was last there, but the area is booming as never before. In addition to the overbooked hotels, the restaurants were packed, and the highways were full of trucks hauling men, equipment, and materials.Notably, there were numerous trucks filled with sand, headed to hydraulic fracturing (fracking) operations. Here is a picture I snapped of a line of trucks queued up at an active fracking site:(Click to enlarge)Sand trucks queued up at a fracking operation.Related: The No.1 Challenge To The Oil RallyAs a quick primer for those who may not know, hydraulic fracturing (fracking) involves pumping water, chemicals, and a proppant down an oil or gas well under high pressure. In the foreground of that picture is a reservoir that is feeding water to the site.The high pressure breaks open channels (fractures) in the reservoir rock trapping the deposit. Oil and gas do not travel easily through some formations, which is why they need to be fractured. The proppant is a granular material designed to hold those channels open, allowing the oil (or natural gas) to flow to the wellbore.Sand has become the proppant of choice for most frac jobs, and producers have figured out that in general, the more sand they use, the more oil and gas they produce.The Permian Basin is a cold, windy and desolate place — but it’s making a lot of people very wealthy. Even those who just own big piles of sand.By Robert RapierMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/A-Look-Inside-The-Worlds-Hottest-Shale-Play.html,"Jan 22, 2018 at 13:50 | Robert Rapier","Jan 22, 2018",A Look Inside The World’s Hottest Shale Play
2018-01-22,"Venezuela is taking over the rotating presidency of OPEC for 2018 at a time when the country’s oil production is falling to a nearly three-decade low amid a severe economic crisis and rampant inflation.While this would be a largely symbolic role for Venezuela to play, the Latin American country has also been part of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) that OPEC had set up to track compliance with the production cuts. Venezuela is keen to see oil prices push higher, and its oil ministry says that the country is firmly intent to achieve oil market balance.Due to the crisis and inability to afford cash for production maintenance, Venezuela is—unwillingly—overcomplying with its share of the OPEC cuts.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Last week, figures by OPEC showed that Venezuela’s oil production declined by another 82,000 bpd in December to 1.745 million bpd. The Venezuelan government’s self-reported figures showed that production plunged by a massive 216,000 bpd in December, to 1.621 million bpd. The country sitting on the world’s largest oil reserves saw its crude oil production drop by 649,000 bpd in 2017—a 29-percent annual plunge—and probably the worst loss of oil production in a single year in recent history.While Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro blames U.S. sanctions for the collapse of the oil industry, and vows to restore production, oilfield services companies have halted operations in the country because of delays in payments by state oil firm PDVSA. The oil company is trying to service its bond obligations with what little cash it has, Venezuela’s obsolete refineries continue to run at lowered rates, and the country is short on gasoline and basic necessities such as food and medicine.
