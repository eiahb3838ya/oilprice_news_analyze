2018-04-17,"Canada’s oil patch booked three consecutive years of hefty losses after the oil prices crash in 2014. This year, the industry is set to post a very slim gross profit—the first profit in four years.Despite the expectation that the tide is finally turning for Canada’s oil producers, significant challenges remain, with constrained pipeline capacity and limited capability to expand export markets the biggest of them all, the Conference Board of Canada said in a report last week.The industry will have its winners and laggards this year, analysts say, but as a whole, it will be a very long and very slow recovery of revenues for the Canadian oil patch, the Conference Board of Canada reckons.Rising oil prices and production will help the oil industry to turn to profitability this year—it is expected to generate a combined US$1.1 billion (C$1.4 billion) in pre-tax profits on revenues of US$73.2 billion (C$92 billion).In the past three years, Canada’s oil patch booked a cumulative loss of US$25.5 billion (C$32 billion) due to the oil price crash that crippled producers’ revenues, Financial Post’s Geoffrey Morgan writes.Revenues at Canadian oil firms are not expected to reach the record US$92.3 billion (C$116 billion) booked in 2014 until 2021, when revenues are seen at US$94.7 billion (C$119 billion).“We just don’t expect (oil) prices to get back to where they were in 2014 any time in the foreseeable future and so the end result is that it’s a very long, slow recovery in terms of the revenue picture,” said Michael Burt, Director, Industrial Economic Trends at the Conference Board of Canada.

Canada’s crude oil production is expected to rise by an average annual rate of 3.4 percent between 2018 and 2022, with the vast majority of that increase coming from the oil sands. However, the competitiveness of Canadian producers is undermined by domestic bottlenecks in pipeline takeaway capacity and surging U.S. shale production, the Conference Board said.“As pipeline capacity in Western Canada cannot keep up with growing production, more oil has to be shipped by rail at a higher cost. This causes a price differential between Canadian oil prices and other global benchmarks, resulting in foregone profits for Canadian oil producers. Canada will also need to rely on new pipelines to expand into new export markets, which might soon become crucial given soaring U.S. oil production,” the Board said.In recent months, transportation bottlenecks widened the discount at which Western Canadian Select (WCS)—the benchmark price of oil from Canada’s oil sands delivered at Hardisty, Alberta—trades relative to West Texas Intermediate (WTI). Some Canadian producers have started to actively market non-core assets, trying to dispose of heavy oil portfolios that they can’t monetize efficiently. Others have slowed down production in response to increased market access constraints.In addition, Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain Expansion project—a pipeline designed to take more oil out of Alberta to the British Columbia coast—now hangs in the balance more than ever before, after Kinder Morgan said it would suspend the project entirely if the legal issues surrounding it cannot be resolved by May 31.According to National Bank Financial analysts, “regulatory and fiscal headwinds continue to challenge the Canadian sector, creating a difficult investment environment.” The bank also expects Canadian oil prices to continue to be volatile and weak through 2022, due to the limited takeaway capacity, with Canada’s oil discount at US$18-22 over the next four years.

These are Canadian Natural Resources, Crescent Point Energy, Enerplus Corp, and Whitecap Resources.Canadian Natural is one of just two companies that analysts at Peters & Co. Ltd. expect to report rising production and cash flow in Q1 over Q4 2017, when companies start to report Q1 earnings later this month. The other is Tourmaline Oil Corp. According to Peters & Co, Cenovus Energy and Seven Generations Energy will also outperform the industry average, while Husky Energy and Imperial Oil are expected to underperform the sector.Canada’s oil patch may be in for a first—albeit paltry—pre-tax profit for the first time in four years, but without additional takeaway capacity, the industry could see its competitiveness further eroded.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Canadas-Oil-Patch-To-Turn-Profitable-In-2018.html,"Apr 17, 2018 at 17:54 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Apr 17, 2018",Canada’s Oil Patch To Turn Profitable In 2018
2018-04-17,"While the continuing Russia-OPEC discussions are dominating headlines, with a focus on a possible extension of the oil production cut agreement into 2019, the market is far from stable.Growing geopolitical tensions, currently stemming from Syria and Iran, have already pushed oil and natural gas prices up. The statements made by the International Energy Agency and OPEC ministers in Paris suggest that the markets may be stabilizing, but these reports may be premature. As OPEC and Russia continue to cut production, crude oil inventories are shrinking worldwide, but a new threat is emerging in oil’s fastest growing market: Asia.India has been a steady growth market for Middle East and African oil suppliers, but the government has recently vented their displeasure with OPEC’s Asian ‘’premium’’ approach for oil and gas prices. Additionally, China and Russia are looking to quell the power of the petrodollar, further amplifying instability in global oil markets.Overall, fundamentals are undeniably improving. Kuwait’s oil minister Bakheet Al Rashidi stated during a summit that he expects OPEC to extend the production cut agreement in June, with the possiblilty of said extension continuing into mid-2019, something that will likely be decided at the end of 2018. Kuwait’s views are in line with several main OPEC producers, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Russia, too, seems to be on board with this plan.OPEC’s optimism about current market developments is growing. OPEC’s Secretary General Mohamed Barkindo stated to the press that OECD commercial crude oil inventories are currently less than 50 million barrels over the five-year average. In 2014 OECD levels were 340 million barrels above. Omani oil minister Mohammed al Rumhy, however, has openly criticized recent statements by OPEC. He warned that the job is not done at all. Uncertainty still persists in large parts of the market.  Related: JP Morgan: Oil Prices Won't Go Higher Than $70Al Rumhy reiterated that OPEC- Russia cooperation is needed to quell any possible stumbling blocks in the market, but also to quell possible new pressure from Asian consumers. Oil investments are still needed to keep production flowing while additional volumes are needed to counter growing Asian demand.One new challenge for MENA oil producers will be the fact that Asian consumers are starting to work against the so-called “Asian Premium”.Indian minister of petroleum Dharmendra Pradhan already stated to the press that India, in close cooperation with China and other Japanese consumers, will be pushing for changes to the “Asian Premium” contracts of OPEC. Sanjiv Singh, chairman of Indian Oil Corporation, and Wan Yalin, chairman of China’s oil giant CNPC, will be setting up a strategy to force OPEC to set a new and fairer price for Asian customers. This could be a major blow to Arab and Iranian oil producers, as it could lower overall revenues dramatically.From an Asian standpoint, the call for change is fair, especially as China, Indian, Japan and South Korea are the main consumers of Middle East oil & gas. The historic approach of an “Asian Premium” was partly based on more costly transportation and high demand for crude and LNG/natural gas in European and U.S. markets. The removal of real competition between East and West of Suez has led to an almost exclusive oil and gas trade strategy between MENA producers and Asian consumers.Asia’s overall position has increased due to economic growth and soaring energy consumption. When looking at the Asian consumers, it no longer seems fair to pay more for the same product. A possible coordinated price change demand by the Asian Tigers, including India, could put Arab and Iranian oil volumes under increased price pressure.OPEC and Russia also need to adjust to a new situation in which Asian consumers are no longer willing to pay top-prices for a commodity that could be replaced by alternative energy sources, such as wind and solar. The willingness to pivot to other energy sources should not be underestimated any longer. Asian consumers such as China or Japan could change their energy consumption behavior rather quickly as governmental policy plays a large role in forming the consumption patterns of these countries.

Further coordination between the world’s largest oil exporters is needed to counter not only U.S. shale but consumer behavior in the rest of the world. A dramatic change in attitude in Asia could be leading to a disaster within years if no concerted efforts are in place in the so-called Russia-OPEC constellation.Arab producers and Moscow can and will be able to address their concerns with the respective governments in Beijing, Tokyo, Delhi or Seoul. Without a real concerted long-term effort, OPEC is going to lose if Moscow choses to play by its own rules.OPEC’s joint ministerial monitoring committee, set up by Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Oman, Venezuela and Kuwait, will meet this week in Jeddah. The output curbs should be on the agenda, but “Asian Premium’ discussions also should be addressed. Discussing the market should not be restricted to rig numbers, production volumes or storage utilizations worldwide. Price settings in Asia, ongoing pressure on the dollar denomination of crude oil and gas, and geopolitics should play a significant role in these internal discussions. Prolonging or extending production cuts would be a sign of the Russia-OPEC alliance’s willingness to cooperate, but addressing the other issues could be a first step along a path to an improved power position for the cartel in the future.Russia-OPEC’s mission is NOT Accomplished. Their ultimate goal is still just a speck on the horizon, and currently there doesn't appear to be a highway to drive on.By Cyril Widdershoven for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Overlooked-Factor-That-Could-Derail-The-OPEC-Deal.html,"Apr 17, 2018 at 12:03 | Cyril Widdershoven","Apr 17, 2018",The Overlooked Factor That Could Derail The OPEC Deal
