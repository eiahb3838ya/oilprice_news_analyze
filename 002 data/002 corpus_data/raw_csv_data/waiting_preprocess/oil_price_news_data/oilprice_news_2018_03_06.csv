2018-03-06,"U.S. shale has effectively upended the oil industry, with predictions that total U.S. oil production will surpass Saudi Arabia’s output this year, in turn rivalling Russia’s to become the preeminent global producer. From its position of being dependent on, and subordinate to OPEC, the U.S. has seemingly become the big bad wolf. Through a catalogue of tactical errors and misplaced belief in its own muscle, the mighty brick edifice of OPEC has begun to look more like a bundle of sticks.The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that the U.S. will become a net energy exporter by the late 2020s, but how accurate is that forecast, and to what extent is it mere hyperbole? In October last year there were already caveats about the nature of U.S. shale, with some warning that aggressive expansion was leading to rapid initial growth that would ultimately peak too soon. Mark Papa, former head of EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG) raised the question of flatlining output in the face of the doubling of the oil rig count, “(h)ow can a rig count be double and yet production be stagnant?""Figures have also been influenced by the rapid pace of technological development, a pace which has itself plateaued. Robert Clarke, WoodMac research director for Lower 48 upstream, said that “(i)f future wells ... are not offset by continued technology evolution, the Permian may peak in 2021”. IEA forecasts then, may be based on rapid growth and technological development that simply isn’t sustainable.

The IEA is still forecasting that the U.S. will be the number one oil exporter by 2023 at 12.1 million bpd, but at the CERAWeek Conference in Houston on Tuesday, Papa is set to turn that thinking on its head when he warns the industry that shale will hit roadblocks that prevent such forecasts from being realized. He says the best drilling locations in North Dakota and South Texas are already tapped out. “The oil market is in a state of misdirection now,” Papa told the WSJ. “Someone needs to speak out.”How much of this is indeed misdirection on his part? Papa is CEO at Centennial Resource Development (NASDAQ: CDEV), which holds the rights to 77,000 acres in the oil-rich Delaware sub-basin of the Permian. A slowdown in expansion and its potential consequence of increased oil prices is advantageous to Centennial’s shareholders, so who are we to believe guilty of misdirection?A more conservative rate of growth may simply be desired by some, but it also may be an inevitability. Kevin Holt, chief investment officer of Invesco's U.S. value equities has said that the situation many companies find themselves in is in part a consequence of the link between their leaders’ pay and production growth, rather than returns on investment. This has fostered a drilling frenzy that has resulted in an explosion of production - an unregulated drilling frenzy that may be at odds with the long term survival of those companies. Investors have subsequently demanded a more conservative approach to drilling, which appears to be having a stabilizing effect.

These pressures shape the nature of the market, and also make it difficult to predict the longevity of tight oil reserves, and the ability of companies to exploit them. Another significant factor is regulation. How long will Trump’s EPA remain the castrated shadow of its former self, and how long until it begins to bare its own teeth?Is Papa’s anticipated warning about to shake up the industry? Or is it merely the continuation of the chorus of restraint that many in the industry have been voicing in this period of massive growth and upheaval? Ultimately the industry will decide whether it will be eating out of Papa’s hand, or persist in biting the hand that feeds it.By Gary Norman for Oilprice.com",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Shale-Pioneer-Issues-Warning-To-US-Drillers.html,"Mar 06, 2018 at 16:47 | Gary Norman","Mar 06, 2018",Shale Pioneer Issues Warning To U.S. Drillers
2018-03-06,"In a recent post, I wrote that the U.S. would almost certainly set a new oil production record this year. I noted that the most recent data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed that last November U.S. oil production exceeded 10 million barrels per day (BPD) for the first time since 1970.Last week the EIA revised November’s oil production upward, which pushed it into the #1 spot for monthly production. The revision increased U.S. oil production in November to 10.057 million BPD, just edging out the previous record of 10.044 million BPD from November 1970.(Click to enlarge)U.S. monthly oil productionHowever, many new records should be set this year, as the EIA projects that oil production will reach 11 million BPD by year-end. This would push the U.S. into first place among the world’s oil producers.But depending on how it is measured, the U.S. is already #1. The 2017 BP Statistical Review of World Energy ranks the U.S. #1 in oil production, but that’s because they include natural gas liquids (NGLs), which have surged in the U.S. along with natural gas production.The gains in U.S. oil production are being driven by production gains across tight oil plays in the Bakken and Eagle Ford, and especially the Permian Basin — where oil production is approaching a staggering 3 million BPD. (See What Record Oil Production In The Permian Basin Looks Like).(Click to enlarge)U.S. tight oil and gas production.However, the continued gains in oil production are helping keep a lid on oil prices. This also increases the pressure on OPEC to prolong production cuts that have helped drain global crude oil inventories.Should OPEC end the production cuts, oil prices could quickly drop 20-30 percent from current levels.By Robert RapierMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Sets-New-Monthly-Oil-Production-Record.html,"Mar 06, 2018 at 13:06 | Robert Rapier","Mar 06, 2018",U.S. Sets New Monthly Oil Production Record
2018-03-06,"The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation can produce crude oil at around US$20 a barrel, but there are plans to bring this even lower, to US$15 a barrel, the company’s group managing director Maikanti Baru told media.""The more we bring down the cost, the more the money that comes to the federal government and into the pockets of state and local governments,"" Baru said.Nigeria has pledged to keep its oil production at 1.8 million barrels daily after OPEC asked it to join the cut efforts to bring down the global inventory overhang. Yet independent local producers are eager to boost their production by 250,000 bpd by 2020. That’s part of a plan to bring Nigeria’s total to 2.5 million barrels daily. At such low production costs, the urge to expand production makes perfect sense.The independents’ plans go counter to Nigeria’s pledge to support OPEC in its oversupply reduction efforts, but this doesn’t seem to have deterred the independents. Nigeria’s plans are for a total 700,000-bpd increase in production by 2020. How this will sit with OPEC is anyone’s guess, especially now, after the IEA warned that new non-OPEC supply would be enough to cover the growth in oil demand globally in the next five years.

The country has been suffering serious fuel shortages and has been negotiating with two consortia to overhaul its subpar refineries. Currently, the country imports billions of dollars’ worth of fuels because local refineries cannot cope with demand.The overhaul was promised by President Muhammadu Buhari when he came into power in 2015, but since then there has been more talk than action on the issue. Meanwhile, capacity utilization rates have been falling, to reach 5.92 percent last November, from a high of 36.73 percent in January the same year – also not a very impressive figure.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Nigeria-Can-Produce-Oil-At-20-A-Barrel.html,"Mar 06, 2018 at 09:29 | Irina Slav","Mar 06, 2018",Nigeria Can Produce Oil At $20 A Barrel
