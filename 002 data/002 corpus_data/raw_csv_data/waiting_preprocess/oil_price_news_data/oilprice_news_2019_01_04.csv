2019-01-04,"U.S. shale executives often boast of low breakeven prices, reassuring investors of their ability to operate at a high level even when oil prices fall. But new data suggests that the industry slowed dramatically in the fourth quarter of 2018 in response to the plunge in oil prices.A survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas finds that shale activity slammed on the brakes in the fourth quarter. “The business activity index—the survey’s broadest measure of conditions facing Eleventh District energy firms—remained positive, but barely so, plunging from 43.3 in the third quarter to 2.3 in the fourth,” the Dallas Fed reported on January 3.The 2.3 reading is only slightly positive – zero would mean that business activity from Texas energy firms was flat compared to the prior quarter. A negative reading would mean a contraction in activity.The deceleration was true for multiple segments within oil and gas. For instance, the oil production index fell from 34.8 in the third quarter to 29.1 in the fourth. The natural gas production index to 24.8 in the fourth quarter, down from 35.5 in the prior quarter.But even as production held up, drilling activity indicated a sharper slowdown was underway. The index for utilization of equipment by oilfield services firms dropped sharply in the fourth quarter, down from 43 points in the third quarter to just 1.6 in the fourth – falling to the point where there was almost no growth at all quarter-on-quarter.  Related: 2019 Could Make Or Break OPECMeanwhile, employment has also taken a hit. The employment index fell from 31.7 to 17.5, suggesting a “moderating in both employment and work hours growth in the fourth quarter,” the Dallas Fed wrote. Labor conditions in oilfield services were particularly hit hard.The data lends weight to comments made by top oilfield service firms from several months ago. Schlumberger and Halliburton warned in the third quarter of last year that shale companies were slowing drilling activity. Pipeline constraints, well productivity problems and “budget exhaustion” was leading to weaker drilling conditions. The comments were notable at the time, and received press coverage, but oil prices were still high and still rising, and so was shale output. The crash in oil prices and the worsening slowdown in the shale patch puts those comments in new light.What does all of this mean? If oil producers are not hiring service firms and deploying equipment, that suggests they are rather price sensitive. The fall in oil prices forced cutbacks in drilling activity. Oilfield service firms in particular are bearing the brunt of the slowdown. Executives from oilfield service firms told the Dallas Fed that their operating margins declined in the quarter.

A further 15 percent said that it was still too early to make a decision on capex changes. Only 31 percent of oil executives who responded to the Fed survey said that the oil price downturn would not affect their spending plans.The oil rig count climbed for much of 2018, but began to level off in the third quarter. The rig count, which stood at 885 in the last week of December, has barely budged since late October when prices began to fall.The downturn is still in its early days. It takes several months before the rig count really begins to respond to major price movements. The same is true for a string of other data – production levels, inventories, as well as capex decisions.In other words, some early data points already suggest that the U.S. shale industry could struggle if WTI remains below $50 per barrel. But the longer WTI stays low, the more likely we will see a broader slowdown.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/New-Data-Suggests-Shocking-Shale-Slowdown.html,"Jan 04, 2019 at 14:12 | Nick Cunningham","Jan 04, 2019",New Data Suggests Shocking Shale Slowdown
2019-01-04,"Crude oil prices have gained roughly 10 percent since hitting a low point in late December, and there are plenty of signs that suggest the market is poised to claw back some further gains in the months ahead. However, all of that depends on the health of the global economy, which is not necessarily guaranteed to cooperate.In fact, a slew of evidence is mounting that global economic activity is starting to slow. U.S. manufacturing data from December points to a slowdown. The Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing managers’ index declined by 5.2 points last month, the largest monthly decrease in ten years.China recently posted similar numbers. Manufacturing activity in China contracted in December, the first time it has done so in nearly two years. “That showed external demand remained subdued due to the trade frictions between China and the U.S., while domestic demand weakened more notably,” wrote Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, a subsidiary of Caixin. “It is looking increasingly likely that the Chinese economy may come under greater downward pressure.”Apple this week slashed its revenue outlook for the first time in nearly two decades, and its share price plunged by 10 percent in response. The lower revenue projection largely comes down to disappointing sales in China. Apple’s fortunes may seem irrelevant to the oil market, but to the extent that it is a symptom of a slowdown in China, then oil traders should probably pay attention.The good news is that the U.S.-China trade war has recently shown some signs of a thaw. Presidents Trump and Xi apparently made good progress on trade disputes during a phone conversation a few days ago. If they can hash out a deal that heads off steep tariff hikes, it could cushion the blow of a potential economic slowdown. The temporary truce between the two countries ends in March.Related: Trade War Could Persist Unless China CavesThe problem is that economic trends, once they get going, can build on themselves, leading to compounding pain. If the economy slows, companies respond by cutting investment, hiring and spending, which slows things down even further. The same is true in bond and equity markets – falling asset prices can kick off stronger short selling. These “doom loops,” as Satyajit Das of Bloomberg Opinion calls them, represent serious pitfalls for the global economy 2019.The Federal Reserve reportedly places the odds of an economic recession this year at 16 percent, which is the highest reading since 2008. The Fed itself is helping to play a role in boosting those odds, hiking interest rates in the face of a darkening economic outlook. The central bank raised interest rates in December and is expected to do so two more times this year.An obscure but important metric suggests an economic recession could be forthcoming. Last month, the yields on five-year U.S. Treasury notes fell below those of two- and three-year notes. Such a development has reliably preceded economic recessions in the past.Related: U.S. Gasoline Prices Could Be About To SkyrocketWhat does all of this mean for oil prices? The market is oversupplied, although prices have already fallen quite a bit to reflect that reality. It’s conceivable that the worst is over, with OPEC+ phasing in supply cuts and Iran sanctions waivers set to expire in several months.But the demand picture is completely up in the air, which is ironic because demand has been steady for several years while supply has confounded analysts. To be sure, predicting supply growth this year is also problematic, but for the first time in quite a while, there is quite a bit of uncertainty about the health of oil demand.The uncertainty is having near-daily effects on oil prices. “Oil is flip-flopping on concerns of supply and demand,” Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago, told Reuters. “It's really a battle between the supply situation, which looks to be tightening, versus the possibility that demand will drop off.”By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-Oil-Demand-Growth-A-Certainty-In-2019.html,"Jan 04, 2019 at 14:08 | Nick Cunningham","Jan 04, 2019",Is Oil Demand Growth A Certainty In 2019?
2019-01-04,"OPEC and US Shale have been duking it out in the oil markets for a few years now—ever since the days of $100 oil. OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, took up a campaign to flood the market with oil to drown out the rising stars of the US Shale world. But that $100 oil came at a price, and the glut sunk prices to uber lows that hurt every oil producer in the world—some more than others.Venezuela was no exception to feeling hurt. Its state oil company, PDVSA—or shall we say the Hugo Chavez administration’s personal piggy bank—was already reeling from corruption, and was busy fighting with foreign oil firms who were operating in country and subsequently booted out. The country had no money to invest in its cash cow to keep it running. President Nicolas Maduro--who took office when oil producers were for the most part fat, dumb, and happy—inherited along with PDVSA a country that was in crisis, with some even saying back then that it was on “the verge of an economic breakdown”, with Moody’s tallying a public sector deficit of 15 percent of its GDP. And when oil prices started to tank, Venezuela’s dire economic situation became direr.Years ago, Venezuela was an instrumental member of OPEC, with Chavez reestablishing Venezuela’s seat at the OPEC table. Today, Venezuela is still an active member, with Maduro serving as one of the loudest cheerleaders of the original OPEC production cut deal solidified in late 2016 after his desperate-but-successful whirlwind tour designed to save its country from ruin with the increased oil revenues that would likely come from such a deal. Maduro visited all the who’s who in the OPEC oil world, including Iran, Qatar, and OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();At that time, Maduro claimed to have a formula that would stabilize oil prices for ten years. That concept, now squarely in the rearview mirror, is clearly viewed as both tragic and laughable, given the recent price swings.  Related: 2019 Could Make Or Break OPECDespite Maduro’s ten-year plan being clearly dead in the water, OPEC was still able to pull off a production cut deal that managed to lift prices for a time. In fact, the plan was so successful, that combined with a few geopolitical events between Iran and the United States and China and the United States, and Libya, Nigeria, and Venezuela’s unintentional production outages, OPEC conspired to lift production mid-2018.  Some would say this is in part attributed to Maduro’s salesmanship.Coming full circle, the market is once again facing falling oil prices along with another planned production cut from the cartel. Venezuela, who did manage to benefit somewhat from the original production cut deal in 2017, is producing fewer and fewer barrels of oil on a monthly basis, ending 2018 with a daily production level that is near 30-year lows for the Latin American country. And no one is holding onto hope that Venezuela’s oil production will rebound—that is, no one but Venezuela.With Venezuela’s production sure to continue its downward spiral, OPEC is bound to catch a break on the production cuts. OPEC agreed to cut 800,000 bpd this time around, and Venezuela will likely eat away at some of that 800,000 bpd, without even trying. This takes some of the heat off other OPEC members who may find it difficult to curb production yet again.On the surface, this indicates that Venezuela’s OPEC membership is paying off for OPEC. It has been instrumental in getting OPEC members on board to reduce production, and it is cutting its own barrels produced in great numbers, even if not on purpose, allowing other members, such as Iraq, to overproduce without hurting OPEC’s overall compliance.  Related: Falling Rig Count Supports Crude PricesHowever, OPEC is a cartel, and that cartel’s purpose is to “coordinate and unify the petroleum policies of its Member Countries and ensure the stabilization of oil markets in order to secure an efficient, economic, and regular supply of petroleum to consumers, a steady income to producers, and a fair return on capital for those investing in the petroleum industry.”Unfortunately for OPEC, Venezuela’s economic and political situation is so bleak that it has almost no control over its own oil production. It cannot ramp up production. It cannot export more. It has failed to secure this “regular supply of petroleum to [its] consumers” as OPEC’s mission statement calls for. In fact, Venezuela has begged, borrowed, and stolen—literally—to keep PDVSA afloat, and still it sinks.Part of OPEC’s claim to fame is that it has the clout to move oil prices up or down, by moving production up or down—and Venezuela can no longer participate in that activity. OPEC’s clout has waned thanks to the rise of US shale, but also due to what some are seeing as OPEC’s almost-maxed production capacity. Surely Venezuela’s production capacity is maxed, and surely that max will continue to decrease. As Venezuela’s production capacity dwindles, so does OPEC’s, which is likely why Russia and a few extras have been brought into the OPEC fold.In the short term, Venezuela helps OPEC to meet some immediate production cut goals. In the long term, however, Venezuela will likely remain a drain on OPEC’s overall capacity, as it is unable to contribute in any meaningful way to the cartel that relies on production manipulation to swing prices.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-Venezuelas-Downward-Spiral-OPECs-Achilles-Heel-Or-Saving-Grace.html,"Jan 04, 2019 at 14:07 | Julianne Geiger","Jan 04, 2019",Is Venezuela’s Downward Spiral OPEC’s Achilles Heel Or Saving Grace?

2019-01-04,"Many articles have been written this past year about the impending demise of OPEC. Shale oil, it has been argued, has ended the cartel’s stranglehold on oil prices.There’s some truth to that argument, but it also understates OPEC’s dominant position in the oil market.I often try to imagine the decisions I would make, given OPEC’s situation and the unexpected emergence of U.S. shale oil production. For decades, OPEC has had the luxury of looking at the global supply and demand outlook, and raising or cutting production as they saw fit.Shale Oil EmergesBut then the U.S. unexpectedly became the world’s fastest-growing supplier of new oil production.(Click to enlarge)Oil Supply Growth 2008-2017Of the 10.3 million BPD of new oil production since 2008, the U.S. supplied 6.2 million BPD (60 percent). The world’s two other major oil-producing countries, Saudi Arabia and Russia, saw their production increase by 1.7 million BPD and 1.2 million BPD respectively since 2008.This surge of new oil production from the U.S. put OPEC under a lot of pressure to either cut production to balance the market, or to defend market share. I thought it was in their best interest to cut production, but instead in 2014 they made the decision to defend market share. I deemed that OPEC’s Trillion Dollar Miscalculation.Prices CollapseFive weeks after that Thanksgiving 2014 announcement, oil prices had dropped into the $40s (after already sliding from ~$100/bbl to the upper $70s over the prior four months). Indeed, OPEC realized its dilemma, and in 2016 the cartel made an agreement with several non-OPEC countries (most importantly, Russia) to cut oil production by 1.8 million BPD.  Related: 2019 Could Make Or Break OPECThat was a significant cut, and oil prices ultimately recovered back to the $70-$80/bbl range. But as I noted in an article last year, U.S. production growth could potentially offset those production cuts in a little over a year.They did. In the past 12 months, U.S. oil production has grown by 1.95 million BPD. This continued growth again puts OPEC in the position of either cutting production to balance the markets, or in potentially letting the price crash. The latter approach had some limited success in 2016, as U.S. production did dip in response to the price war. But as soon as prices recovered, so did U.S. production.OPEC’s New ParadigmBut OPEC still produced 42.6 percent of the world’s oil in 2017. Add Russia to the mix, and the two entities controlled 55 percent of global oil production and nearly 80 percent of the world’s proved oil reserves in 2017.Total production from OPEC and Russia is more than 50 million BPD. In theory, they should have substantial pricing power, but the rapid growth of U.S. shale oil production continues to give them headaches.Related: Oil Rises On Hopes Of A U.S.-China Trade DealIt is certain that the U.S. oil production surge broke OPEC’s stranglehold on global oil prices. If the shale oil boom in the U.S. hadn’t happened, OPEC and Russia would have enjoyed the fruits of $100/bbl oil for the past decade. The U.S. trade deficit would have ballooned.So now OPEC has to look at the supply/demand picture and try to estimate just how much further U.S. production can expand. If we are reaching the limits of shale production growth, then OPEC can go through a couple of cycles of production cuts, and they will be back in the driver’s seat.But if U.S. production can expand for another decade, OPEC will have lost complete control over oil prices. In that case, U.S. production will likely only slow when electric vehicles are starting to take a serious bite out of global oil demand.Speaking of which, oil demand continues to grow at more than 1 million BPD every year. That helps mitigate the impact of U.S. production growth. But as long as U.S. production grows annually at a faster pace than global demand — which it has several times in recent years — OPEC is going to have to live with either production cuts (which also help prop up marginal U.S. producers) or lower prices.By Robert RapierMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/OPEC-Is-Losing-Its-Stranglehold-On-Oil-Prices.html,"Jan 04, 2019 at 13:49 | Robert Rapier","Jan 04, 2019",OPEC Is Losing Its Stranglehold On Oil Prices

2019-01-04,"A day after the American Petroleum Institute reported sizeable builds in fuel inventories, the Energy Information Administration confirmed a build in gasoline and distillate inventories for the week to December 28, and substantial ones, at that.Gasoline inventories added 6.9 million barrels, while distillate fuel inventories rose by as much as 9.5 million barrels in the reporting period. A week earlier, gasoline inventories went up by 3 million barrels, with distillate fuel remaining flat on the week.The authority reported crude oil inventories remained virtually unchanged on the week but at 441.4 million barrels, inventories are 8 percent above seasonal limits – a fact likely to increase the chronic anxiety on oil markets.Gasoline production in the final week of 2018 averaged 9.5 million barrels daily, the EIA also reported, with distillate fuel production at 5.6 million barrels daily. These figures compared with 10.1 million bpd of gasoline produced a week earlier and 5.4 million bpd of distillate fuel. Refineries last week processed an average of 17.4 million bpd in the week to December 28.Oil prices started the year on the seesaw, with sharp rises and drops within a single trading session as the market weighed the potential effects of events such as the entry into effect of the OPEC+ agreement to cut 1.2 million bpd from their combined production and news such as the reports of Saudi Arabia cutting its exports in December to prop up prices. One analyst told CNBC earlier this week the “Saudis are trying to engineer a fall, if not plunge, in U.S. crude oil inventories to give the appearance of global tightness.”At the time of writing, Brent crude traded at US$58.06, up by 3.77 percent, and West Texas Intermediate changed hands for US$48.95 a barrel, up by 3.95 percent from yesterday’s close. The improvement is likely a result of the OPEC cuts entering into effect as well as hopes for a trade deal between Washington and Beijing.
