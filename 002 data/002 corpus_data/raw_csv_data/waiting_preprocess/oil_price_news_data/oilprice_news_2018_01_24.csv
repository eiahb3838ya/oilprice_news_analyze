2018-01-24,"The oilfield services industry was hit hard by the 2014 oil price crash after exploration and production companies reduced investments and drilling during the downturn. The ripple effect on the oilfield services business was fewer wells to drill, lower day rates amid competition to obtain drilling contracts, and thousands of layoffs.But the oil price rally at the end of 2017 is now spreading optimism among the biggest oilfield services providers — an upbeat mood they haven’t exhibited in four years.The pick-up in shale activity last year supported some of the oilfield services groups’ revenues and margins, but it still wasn’t enough for an overall optimistic outlook in their Q3 financials. The Q4 earnings releases of the world’s biggest oilfield services groups — Schlumberger and Halliburton — however, showed an upbeat outlook on the recovery of the international markets, for the first time in years.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();After three difficult years for E&P firms and oilfield services providers, the rise in oil prices in the second half of 2017 — along with the huge cost cuts across the board — led to Big Oil calling the end of austerity and looking to start rewarding shareholders by removing scrip dividends and resuming share buybacks.While oil majors declared the downturn over with their Q3 2017 better-than-expected earnings, oilfield services providers were still languishing in supply chain hell, with the only positive note — to some extent — being North American shale.  Related: This World Class Gas Field Is About To Start ProducingNow Schlumberger and Halliburton — which reported Q4 earnings in the past week — not only beat analyst forecasts, but also signaled optimism for 2018, expecting a busy North American shale activity and, for the first time in a few years, growth (albeit choppy and slim) on international markets.Schlumberger’s earnings per share (EPS) excluding charges increased 14 percent sequentially to $0.48 in Q4, beating the $0.44 consensus estimate. North America revenue rose 8 percent on the quarter, while international revenues increased 2 percent.“In North America, 2018 shale oil production is set for another year of strong growth, as the positive oil market sentiments will likely increase both investment appetite and availability of financing,” Schlumberger chairman and CEO Paal Kibsgaard said.“In the international market, we expect growth in all regions in 2018 for the first time since 2014,” Kibsgaard said at the Q4 earnings call.After Schlumberger, it was Halliburton’s turn. Earlier this week, Halliburton reported adjusted income from continuing operations at $0.53 per diluted share for Q4, beating the $0.46 consensus forecast.Halliburton’s international business started to show signs of recovery in the latter part of 2017, driven primarily by improved performance in the Middle East, the North Sea, and Latin America, president and CEO Jeff Miller said at the earnings call. “I believe that the U.S. land market will be very busy in 2018 and that demand for horsepower will continue to grow,” Miller noted, adding that “As for the international markets, I am encouraged for the first time in three years.”The top manager noted that the recovery would likely be choppy, but still, the signs are there that the international market for oilfield services is improving along with the rise in oil prices.What’s more, Halliburton expects the higher price of oil and demand for equipment to provide “runway for us to continue to increase our pricing through the first half of the year,” Miller said.The cost inflation may be a curse for the E&P companies, but it’s a welcome boon for the oilfield services industry that has suffered from the very low pricing during the downturn.  Related: The Biggest Year Yet For U.S. ShaleNot only the world’s largest oilfield services providers are upbeat on the 2018 prospects for the industry — analysts also say that there are reasons to believe that the oilfield services business is starting to exit survival mode.Amid rising oil prices, E&P companies raised capital expenditures in North American shale and the number of offshore projects by more than 50 percent in 2017, which resulted in a restart of the oilfield service industry, Rystad Energy said in a report last month. Companies that beat the overall market were mostly those exposed to North American shale, while laggards are mainly exposed to the offshore and subsea markets.“Suppliers in the U.S. have started hiring and have been increasing their workforce by 2% every month since October 2016. For the offshore market, suppliers have stepped down lay-offs and are in the last phase of completing workforce reductions,” Rystad said.The consultancy expects offshore and onshore greenfield projects worth as much as $200 billion to be sanctioned globally this year, which would result in an average of 4-percent service price inflation.Judging from the upbeat outlooks from Halliburton and Schlumberger, this year could finally mark the end of the downturn for the oilfield services business.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oilfield-Services-Bounce-Back-On-Oil-Rally.html,"Jan 24, 2018 at 14:56 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Jan 24, 2018",Oilfield Services Bounce Back On Oil Rally
2018-01-24,"Among the fears that grip today’s oil markets, nothing is as strong as the uncontrollable rise of U.S. shale production. While OPEC and its partners have managed to push oil prices back to three-year highs, soaring U.S. shale production looms over markets, threatening to change the global energy market for good.With U.S. oil production already touching 9.78 mbpd, the IEA estimates that it will cross 11 mbpd by 2019 and 10.3 this year. While this projected growth is staggering, the continued strength of today’s shale boom is far from certain. Companies are shifting management strategies to pursue profit over growth, and the incredible technological advancements accomplished thus far will have to continue.First, the reported shift by producers from focusing on growth to targeting profitability could slow production. To achieve growth, companies have had to accumulate debts, but shale producers are now moving away from the growth-at-any-cost model. Shareholders are calling on companies to begin turning over profits.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Companies like EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) and Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) have underperformed over the past five years, while Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR) reported a 5-year loss. Yet shale companies continued to raise money in 2017, with $60 billion raised from bond sales, resulting in a rising number of rigs and increased production.Andreas De Vries, a Strategy Consultant in the Oil & Gas industry, is bullish on shale growth, claiming that the focus has certainly shifted from profitability to growth and that shale producers tend to hedge on higher prices to protect their production. In my view, at almost $70 there will be plenty of hedging taking place.(Click to enlarge)At the same time, technological changes are making the industry ever more efficient. According to a Forge River Research statement in Seeking Alpha, “Lower service costs, technological advancements, and operational efficiencies have reduced U.S. E&P company breakeven points.”Related: The Blockchain Revolution Is Heading To SpaceThe industry is experimenting with new ways to enhance production while keeping the costs low. In some cases, completions have even quadrupled in terms of proppant and number of stages (proppants being of key importance to the drilling industry). Longer laterals are helping to increase production, complimenting directional drilling. According to some observers, the amount of oil produced for every dollar will double in the future as these technological improvements continue. These tech advances may provide drillers with a reason to return to a heavy growth model.The tech improvements have seen breakeven costs drop rapidly, with the Permian breakeven point reportedly $48, while Eagle Ford’s is $47. A McKinsey report hails the technology driven U.S. shale boom as a success story, with the Permian as its main protagonist. The report debunks claims that the world will see a supply crunch by 2021, claiming that capex will grow by 25 percent p.a. while drilling completions will grow by 20 percent p.a. through 2021.While this may all sound like good news for shale producers, there remains a threat of overproduction, leaving the industry with the same problem as OPEC: too much winning.“Getting too far above $70” can both stimulate new supply and affect the economy, Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs, said in a Bloomberg article. “OPEC members do not want to see that.”While dangers undoubtedly remain and growth isn’t a certainty, it’s safe to say that the future of U.S. shale looks bright.By Osama Rizvi for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-The-Shale-Boom-A-Certainty.html,"Jan 24, 2018 at 10:30 | Osama Rizvi","Jan 24, 2018",Is The Shale Boom A Certainty?
2018-01-24,"A day after the American Petroleum Institute surprised the market with a substantial inventory build, the Energy Information Administration dispelled doubts about the balance between supply and demand by reporting a draw of 1.1 million barrels for the week to January 19.This compares with a draw of 6.9 million barrels for the week to January 12.At 411.6 million barrels, inventories of crude oil in the world’s top consumer are still within the average of the seasonal range and this is the tenth straight weekly draw, according to EIA, which would only strengthen the sentiment that demand for crude in the world’s top consumer is robust.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Gasoline inventories booked yet another weekly build, meanwhile, at 3.1 million barrels. In the prior week, gasoline inventories had risen by 3.6 million barrels, with production averaging 9.7 million bpd. Last week, average daily gasoline production stood at 9.4 million barrels per day, with refineries processing a total 16.5 million barrels of crude.After a slight decline last week, both Brent and WTI have been doing well this week, with the international benchmark touching US$70 a barrel again for the first time since January 15 earlier today in Asian trade.However, with bullish bets on the most popular crude oil contracts at record highs, traders are beginning to prepare for a price drop. Reuters reported today that the amount of put options on Brent crude futures has jumped markedly. The open interest on Brent put options at a price of US$70, US$69, and US$68 is now much higher than it was less than a week ago and there is more demand for put options on the contract than for call options.Also, there is talk about a recession, with the U.S. stock market at multi-year highs and due for a correction. A recent warning from Goldman Sachs that risk appetite has reached an extreme level could have a sobering effect on the market but EIA’s latest figures would hardly support it.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Markets-Relieved-After-EIA-Reports-Crude-Inventory-Draw.html,"Jan 24, 2018 at 09:47 | Irina Slav","Jan 24, 2018",Oil Markets Relieved After EIA Reports Crude Inventory Draw
