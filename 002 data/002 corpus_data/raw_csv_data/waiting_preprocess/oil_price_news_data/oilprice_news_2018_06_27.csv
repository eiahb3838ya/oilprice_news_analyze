Production averaged 5.4 million barrels daily, down slightly from 5.5 million barrels daily a week earlier.Oil prices have remained highly volatile after OPEC’s meeting in Vienna, not least because traders expected a bigger cut but also because the U.S. State Department has increased the pressure on its international allies to stop importing crude oil from Iran.
