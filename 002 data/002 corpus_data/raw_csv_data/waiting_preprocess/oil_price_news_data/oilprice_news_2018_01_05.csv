2018-01-05,"Higher shipments of Russian crude oil to China may saddle European importers with a fatter bill, an industry consultancy warned at the end of last year, noting the latest stage of Russia’s Eastern pivot: the launch of the expanded East Siberia-Pacific Ocean pipeline that would lift Urals crude supply to China twofold, to 30 million tons annually. FGE said in a note quoted by Bloomberg that Russia will start moving more Urals eastward right after the launch of the pipeline extension, at a rate of 160,000 bpd. The overall increase of Russian crude shipments to China, according to the consultancy, could be around 200,000 bpd. This means less oil for Europe, which is Russia’s number-one oil client. This only highlights the significance of Moscow’s Asian pivot amid lingering European sanctions following the 2014 annexation of Crimea and Russia’s involvement in separatist conflicts in the Ukraine. In 2016, Russia exported an average 3.7 million barrels daily to European countries, compared with less than a million bpd to China, according to figures from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). In percentage figures, Europe accounted for 70 percent of Russia’s 2016 crude oil exports, while the share of China was just 18 percent. Yet this is changing fast, as this chart from the EIA shows:(Click to enlarge)The rise in Chinese exports has been quite steep since 2014: as of November last year, Russia shipped 1.3 million barrels of oil daily to China. All the latest signs point to further growth. However, exactly how much this would hurt European buyers is unclear.   Related: Renewable Energy On The Rise In U.S. Electricity GenerationThe Urals is currently trading at a discount of about $4 to Brent crude but WTI’s discount to the international benchmark is $6 a barrel. In other words, Russia’s diverting of crude oil from Europe to China could be an opportunity for U.S. exporters as long as they can keep their transport costs low enough. Europe will probably be grateful for the diversification. Over the long term, things are even more uncertain. Clearly, Russia has prioritized its relationship with China: In addition to the ESPO expansion, Gazprom is on track to complete the Power of Siberia gas pipeline by 2019. The 2,500-km mammoth of a pipeline will pump 1.3 trillion cu ft of gas to China annually. The country is already the third-largest consumer of natural gas in the world, behind the U.S. and Russia, and is expected to show the strongest demand growth over the coming decades—propelling it to second place by 2040 as the economy shifts away from coal. This soaring demand has already created shortages in parts of the country. A recent report by Eurasia Daily suggested the Power of Siberia will be essential in avoiding future gas shortages. Would that take gas away from Europe? It’s unlikely given Gazprom’s 30+-percent market share in Europe, and besides, there’s enough gas for everyone. What might happen is China overtaking Europe as Russia’s biggest gas export market at some point in the future, especially if Russia–EU relations continue to be strained.

2018-01-05,"New life was breathed into the Canadian oil sands with a decision by foreign-owned Harvest Operations Corp to commission its BlackGold project south of Fort McMurray.The Calgary-based arm of South Korean state-owned Korea National Oil Corp announced on Dec. 21 it will start the 10,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) operation, construction at which was halted in 2015 due to low oil prices.In a press release on SEDAR, Harvest said that major work at the site has already started, with the aim of commissioning wells and starting steam injection in Q2 2018. Production is slated for the third quarter.It cites ""the stabilization of crude oil pricing and the improved operational and financial performance of Harvest’s conventional business as factors in its decision to move forward with BlackGold.""The start-up has been helped through a refinancing of $1.36 billion of maturing debt, plus the raising last month of an additional quarter-million in financing, the company said.Global News notes the project was built for around $900 million and was ""considered mechanically complete"" when it was shelved in the spring of 2015 when WTI oil prices were around $50 a barrel, half as much as a year earlier.WTI on Thursday closed at $59.84, for a percentage gain of 0.34%.  Related: 2018: The Year Of The Oil BullsThe Canadian oil sands have seen an exodus of foreign investment since the oil price collapse of 2014 and US shale plays gathered momentum. The divestments have included Royal Dutch Shell, Marathon Oil, Statoil and ConocoPhillips.Yesterday AXA SA, the third-largest insurer in the world, said that it will divest about $822 million from the main oil sands producers and associated pipelines, and will stop further investments in these businesses. The move could affect companies such as TransCanada, Enbridge and Kinder Morgan.But as foreign companies have pulled out money, Canadian firms have made multi-billion-dollar deals to expand their holdings. According to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, Canadian ownership of oil sands production now sits at over 80%, reported the Calgary Herald.By Mining.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-This-The-Beginning-Of-An-Oil-Sands-Revival.html,"Jan 05, 2018 at 14:31 | MINING.com ","Jan 05, 2018",Is This The Beginning Of An Oil Sands Revival?
2018-01-05,"It’s the start of the New Year, so here is my overview for your energy portfolio coming into 2018. I have written in the past six months in a far more aggressive slant than most on oil and oil stocks, and we’ve been rewarded as oil has rallied above $62 a barrel. For those who relied upon the forecasts of the bank analysts and government agencies, I’m afraid you’re well behind the curve – the oil train has already left the station.Which doesn’t mean you should give up on oil – this bull market that I have predicted in oil and oil equities is just starting and has at least another two years to roll – making 2018 the key year for positioning and profitability. If you haven’t started putting together an aggressive list of stocks for the coming year yet, it’s not too late to start. That’s what this column is about.In energy investing, I have always been successful by analyzing a medium to long-term thesis on energy prices and trends that normally points me in a more likely sub-sector for success. For example, if I could make the case that technology in off-shore drilling was accelerating, helping to slash costs of deepwater recovery, I might center on those producers to have stellar years that would outperform other energy sectors. Instead, if you’ve read my columns, you’ll know that I have analyzed U.S. horizontal production as the most likely to earn the biggest profits, and tried to…					    ",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-It-Time-To-Get-Aggressive-On-Oil-Stocks.html,"Jan 05, 2018 at 14:23 | Dan Dicker","Jan 05, 2018",Is It Time To Get Aggressive On Oil Stocks?
2018-01-05,"U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil finished 2017 higher in what can best be described as a volatile two-sided trade. After trending lower from January to June, the market stabilized enough to fuel an even stronger rally during the latter half of the year, ending on a high note after reaching its highest level since July 2015.WTI crude oil is in a position to pick up where it left off in 2017 by finishing higher the first week of the new year higher on concerns that the escalation of unrest in Iran will eventually have an effect on supply and another decline in U.S. inventories as refining activity hit a 12-year high.According to weekly government statistics, U.S. stocks fell more than expected, continuing a steady drawdown of supplies in the world’s largest oil consumer, though stocks of distillates and gasoline rose on heavy refining activity driven in part by year-end adjustments.The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. crude stocks fell by 7.4 million barrels in the last week of 2017, exceeding expectations, as refiners boosted activity to their highest rate since 2005.Some traders are starting to question the validity of the rally since the unrest in Iran is expected to have no impact on the OPEC member’s ability to produce oil. Furthermore, the North Sea Forties and the Libyan pipelines are back to carrying oil. Additionally, U.S. production will likely break though 10 million barrels per day.Ignoring…					    ",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Crude-Oil-Is-Approaching-A-Major-Retracement-Zone.html,"Jan 05, 2018 at 14:01 | Jim Hyerczyk","Jan 05, 2018",Crude Oil Is Approaching A Major Retracement Zone
2018-01-05,"It is both the best and worst of times for the current Iraqi oil market. Iraqi oil minister Jabbar al-Luaibi said this week that Iraqi oil fields in the south of the country had recorded an 'unprecedented' surge in daily exports from Basrah during the last month. All the while, loadings in Ceyhan, Turkey, of crude from the Kirkuk pipeline in the north of the country continue to remain in check amid regional unrest.December monthly loadings from Basrah were strong, although not unprecedented, according to our vessel-tracking, vessel lineups and port agent data - reaching their highest monthly level in 2017. While loadings bound for the U.S. hovered around half a million barrels per day for a second month, the most interesting development came from those flows heading east of Suez.East Asia has traditionally been the largest market for southern Iraqi crude barrels, with China leading the charge (it receives about double the volume that heads to South Korea).googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();But as Indian crude demand continues to grow, spurred on by both domestic demand and increased refining activity, our ClipperData show the first material increase of barrels loaded for South Asia over East Asia on our records:(Click to enlarge)All the while, the U.S. remains the third leading destination for Basrah Light and Basrah Heavy, with deliveries averaging nearly 590,000 bpd in 2017, up over a third versus 2016 arrivals.
