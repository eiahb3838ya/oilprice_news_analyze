2018-05-30,"In a desperate bid to keep its last remaining proposed oil pipeline alive, Canada has decided to buy Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain Pipeline system for an estimated C$4.5 billion.Canada will pay Kinder Morgan for the money that the company has already spent on the expansion project as well as for the existing Trans Mountain pipeline, which has a capacity of about 300,000 bpd.Trans Mountain runs from Alberta to British Columbia and the proposed expansion would be a twin line that would triple the system’s carrying capacity to 890,000 bpd. British Columbia has vowed to block the pipeline even though the federal government supports the project. BC’s opposition had nearly killed the project…and still might finish it off despite the gamble by the federal government to nationalize the pipeline system.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();As Reuters discovered, it appears that Canada has been taken for a ride by Kinder Morgan. The Texas-based pipeline company structured deals in such a way that it couldn’t lose, even if the project stalled. “Kinder Morgan cut creative deals with lenders and oil producers to shield itself from massive write-downs like the ones taken recently by rivals TransCanada Corp and Enbridge Inc in canceling controversial pipeline projects,” Reuters wrote.These deals included requiring oil producers to pay even if the project was blocked by regulatory holdups. Also, the 26 lenders that Kinder Morgan negotiated with agreed to exempt the pipeline company from penalties on loans if the project was delayed or obstructed because of political problems.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau first proposed to indemnify the project from risk, but ultimately decided to purchase it outright as the May 31 deadline neared.“Kinder Morgan wins,” Brian Kessens, managing director investment firm Tortoise, which holds shares in Kinder Morgan Inc., told Reuters. “That’s a very fair price.”Kinder Morgan agreed, hailing the payout from Canada. “This is a great day, not only for our company but for Canada,” CEO Steve Kean said. And as for who will manage the pipeline project while it’s under government ownership, Canada’s Finance Minister Bill Morneau said he hopes to hire people from…Kinder Morgan.First Nations and environmental groups assailed Trudeau for buying out the project. “We are absolutely shocked and appalled that Canada is willingly investing taxpayers’ money in such a highly controversial fossil fuel expansion project,” Grand Chief Stewart Philip, president of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, told the Toronto Star. “We will not stand down no matter who buys this ill-fated and exorbitantly priced pipeline.”In a scathing article in The Guardian, environmentalist Bill McKibben called Justin Trudeau “the world’s newest oil executive,” and said that “the cutest, progressivest, boybandiest leader in the world” is going “fully in the tank for the oil industry.”But it wasn’t just First Nations and environmentalists. Trudeau is coming under fire from all sides. Even the Conservatives criticized the government for leaving taxpayers on the hook for the project. Kinder Morgan only paid $550 million for the Trans Mountain pipeline back in 2007. Trudeau has decided to fork over $C3.4 billion for a system that is a now a decade older with no plan on how to get the expansion constructed. “Kinder Morgan wasn’t asking for the money. They were asking for certainty and a pathway to get the get the project built,” Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said. “The prime minister is forcing Canadian taxpayers to pay for his failure.”Obviously, not everyone is against the project. The oil industry welcomed the news, although cautioned that it shouldn’t become the norm. “We think that today’s announcement is based on extraordinary circumstances,” Tim McMillan, CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said in a press conference Tuesday. “We don’t want to find ourselves in this situation again.”Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was desperate to push the project forward, arguing that the lack of pipeline capacity – Alberta’s pipelines are just about full – are costing Canadian oil producers C$15 billion annually.He’s right on that account. The cost of pipeline bottlenecks continues to weigh on Canada’s oil industry. Western Canada Select (WCS), a benchmark that tracks heavy oil in Canada, has traded at a significant discount to WTI (which, in turn, has seen its discount widen relative to Brent).  Related: The Biggest Challenge For U.S. Oil ExportsWCS fell to the mid-$40s per barrel this week, more than $20 lower than WTI and nearly $30 lower than Brent. Although some of the discount is due to transportation costs and quality issues, the price differential has exploded over the past year as Alberta’s available takeaway capacity has all but vanished.The problem for Trudeau, however, is that it isn’t at all clear that his takeover of Kinder Morgan’s pipeline will resolve outstanding issues. The plan consists of purchasing the pipeline system, clearing the political obstacles, and then selling off the project to a private company again.But it remains to be seen if the federal government can bulldoze British Columbia into allowing the project to move forward. The government also does not have a buyer in mind to eventually take on the project.In a less-than-optimistic sign, Finance Minister Bill Morneau said that the government does not want to own the pipeline for a long period of time, but he conceded that it could remain the owner for the “medium term.” While he didn’t elaborate on what that actually means, his comment suggests the Trans Mountain Expansion is not moving forward anytime soon.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Oil-Giant-That-Outsmarted-Trudeau.html,"May 30, 2018 at 16:39 | Nick Cunningham","May 30, 2018",The Oil Giant That Outsmarted Trudeau
2018-05-30,"Continuing a national trend, the United States’ second-largest oil refining company has recently requested a biofuel hardship waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The waiver, if granted, would allow refining giant Marathon Petroleum Corp. to exempt one of its facilities from Obama-era federal biofuel quotas.This move coincides with a recent campaign by the EPA to expand biofuel waivers, to the delight of the oil industry and the equally strong dismay of the corn lobby, who depend on the biofuel standard for sales of alternative corn-based fuels like ethanol. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) has been a huge boon to farmers, creating a 15 billion gallon a year market for corn-based ethanol. On the other hand, over the past few months the EPA has saved the oil industry hundreds of millions of dollars in regulatory costs by way of similar biofuel hardship waivers.These waivers are given to small refineries who are able to prove that complying with the RFS, which obligates them to mix biofuels (like ethanol) into their fuel, would result in “disproportionate economic hardship.” While the EPA has always had this authority, they have recently been ramping up their grants of these waivers under new administration and Scott Pruitt’s direction.Now Ohio-based Marathon is pushing the limits of the waiver requisites by making a waiver request for one of their plants, since it certainly is not a “small” refinery by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, Marathon’s smallest refinery, based in Canton, Ohio, has an output of 93,000 barrels per day, well above the cap that the EPA has defined for “small refineries” at 75,000 barrels per day. While Marathon may be able to find a loophole by running the plant under capacity, or perhaps apply for just a portion of one of its larger facilities, the EPA has not publicly made any decision as to whether the request will be granted.  Related: Court: Petrobras Strike Is IllegalMarathon’s biofuel waiver request is not the first by a major oil industry player claiming hardship. U.S. supermajors ExxonMobil and Chevron, among the most profitable companies in the world, have also petitioned the EPA for hardship waivers. If granted, these requests by Marathon, ExxonMobil, and Chevron also won’t be the first waivers the EPA has approved for a refinery owned by decidedly not small company. Just a few months ago billionaire Carl Icahn was granted a hardship waiver for his 74,500-bpd Wynnewood, Oklahoma, refinery. The plant is owned by Icahn’s CVR Energy. Though he stepped down in August, Icahn was notably a special advisor to President Trump regulatory reform and other related issues.Reuters has reported that the EPA has granted dozens of small refinery waivers for 2017 in the past months, according to a source from within the agency. This would mean that the rate at which the EPA is granting waivers under President Donald Trump has tripled as compared to past administrations. This has created a major point of contention between the powerful oil and corn lobbies.The biofuel industry was already struggling before the recent waiver wave, but they were already pointing to the new administration as the culprit for strikingly low ethanol demand based on previous projections. As a result, many refiners have been shuttering or selling off their biofuel facilities.  Related: U.S. Oil Exports Eat Into OPEC Market Share In AsiaIn the midst of these industry contentions, there has also been a lot of political pressure on the current administration to slow its approval of biofuel waivers and to stop doting on the oil industry. Most notably, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, one of the nation’s biggest corn producers, has been extremely vocal in his condemnation of the direction the EPA has taken under Pruitt, going so far as to call for his resignation in the flood of biofuel wavers doesn’t stop.Now, however, the Trump administration seems to be changing its tune in order to appease Big Corn, claiming that in an upcoming biofuels policy overhaul the EPA will be significantly scaling back its hardship waiver grants. After hosting a series of meetings between representatives for the corn and oil refining industries, the White House has said that they are in the final stages of creating new biofuel policies and have indicated that an announcement is impending.By Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Oil-Companies-Look-To-Skirt-Biofuel-Quotas.html,"May 30, 2018 at 13:34 | Haley Zaremba","May 30, 2018",U.S. Oil Companies Look To Skirt Biofuel Quotas
2018-05-30,"Electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to displace 2.5 million bpd of oil demand by 2030, as supportive policies and cost reductions will likely lead to constantly growing EV sales, according to a senior analyst at the International Energy Agency (IEA).“In the report, we refer to 2.5 million b/d in the case of 2030,” Platts quoted Pierpaolo Cazzola, senior energy and transport analyst at the IEA, as saying on Wednesday in Tokyo, where the agency presented its Global EV Outlook 2018.Last year, EVs displaced 400,000 bpd of diesel and gasoil demand, mostly due to two-and-three wheelers, followed by buses and light duty vehicles, the 2018 outlook says.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();A record more than 1 million electric cars were sold worldwide in 2017, with half of new sales in China, where nearly 580,000 electric cars were sold last year, a 72-percent surge from 2016, IEA said.Despite the record new sales, only a handful of countries have significant market share—Norway remains the world’s most advanced market for electric car sales, with over 39 percent of new sales in 2017, followed by Iceland at 11.7 percent, then Sweden at 6.3 percent.Government and local policies, as well as technological progress in performance and reduction of the costs of lithium-ion batteries helped the EV sales last year.“However, further battery cost reductions and performance improvements are essential to improve the appeal of EVs,” the IEA said.“The future of EVs hinges on demand for scarce materials,” the agency added, noting that the shift to EVs will increase demand for some materials, in particular cobalt and lithium.

Should policy ambitions rise even further to meet climate goals and other sustainability targets, as in the EV30@30 Scenario, the number of electric cars on the road could be as high as 220 million in 2030,” the IEA said.The EV30@30 campaign is aimed at speeding up the deployment of electric vehicles and targets at least 30 percent new electric vehicle sales by 2030. Governments supporting EV 30@30 include Canada, China, Finland, France, India, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden.EVs are one of just four clean-energy technologies out of 38 technologies that are on track to meet the world’s long-term climate goals, make energy universally accessible, and significantly lower air pollution, IEA said last week.
