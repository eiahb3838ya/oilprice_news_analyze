2018-03-07,"The U.S. could add around 4 million barrels per day (mb/d) of additional supply in the coming years, and most of it will be shipped abroad, turning the U.S. into a major oil exporter.Most of the new supply will come in the form of light sweet and ultra-light oil. But because refineries along the Gulf Coast are largely equipped to handle medium and heavy crude, the new production probably won’t find a home inside the U.S.A new study from Wood Mackenzie predicts that only about 900,000 bpd of the additional supply will be taken up in the domestic market, leaving more than 3 mb/d for export should those aggressive production forecasts play out. Meanwhile, Bernstein Research was even more definitive, arguing that essentially all new additional supply will be shipped abroad.Ultimately, the IEA forecasts that U.S. crude export capacity could hit nearly 5 mb/d by 2023.WoodMac estimates that initially a lot of the exported crude will head to Europe, where refining values are high. However, U.S. oil will have to compete with crude coming from West Africa. Once the European market is saturated, U.S. shale oil will be rerouted to Asia. Hefty transportation costs to Asia will force U.S. shipments to be offered at a steep discount if they are to be competitive. Nevertheless, it seems likely that exports will steadily ratchet up.However, the flood of new oil coming from the U.S. shale fields will require an overhaul of pipeline and export terminals along the Gulf Coast. The Permian Basin is expected to lead the way, adding around 2 mb/d of additional supply by 2023. Already, the basin is facing pipeline bottlenecks, forcing producers to wait to complete drilled wells.(Click to enlarge)But the midstream sector is scrambling to resolve the issues.  Related: Shell Takes Major Steps Toward Energy DiversificationThe Capline pipeline that runs from Louisiana to Illinois, and used to shuttle large volumes of imported oil north to Midwest refineries, has seen volumes plummet. Its owner is now looking to reverse the flow, sending Bakken crude to the Gulf Coast, either for refining or export.As the FT notes, a flurry of other projects are also in the works. New pipelines – the BridgeTex, Permian Express and Cactus pipelines – have begun ferrying Permian oil to the coast of Texas in the past two years, erasing what had once been a steep discount for Midland crude relative to WTI due to the infrastructure bottlenecks.But, with output in the Permian continuing to rise at a rapid clip, more capacity is needed. For instance, the Cactus pipeline network is set to add two more lines, expanding capacity from 390,000 bpd to 575,000 bpd. The lines run from the Permian to Corpus Christi, and the expansion is expected to come online by the end of next year.Overall, an estimated 2.1 mb/d of midstream capacity is under construction, according to RBN Energy, and cited by the FT.“Everybody wants to get to water,” Corey Prologo, director of North American oil trading at Trafigura, told the CERAWeek Conference on Tuesday, the FT reported. “All the current pipelines are getting filled out, which they previously weren’t.”New export capacity along the coast will also be required. The recent upgrading of the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) has inaugurated a new era of U.S. exports, allowing very large crude carriers (VLCCs) to load up on U.S. shale to be shipped abroad.  Related: Is The Sky The Limit For U.S. Shale?Additional expansions to handle the surging shale supply are also in the offing. WoodMac says the port of Corpus Christi is the obvious next candidate for increases in shipments. The consultancy sees crude exports from Corpus Christi rising to 1 mb/d by 2020 and 2 mb/d by 2023.  It all amounts to a radical reworking of the U.S.’ pipeline and export facilities, channeling oil that had once gone from the coast to the interior back in the other direction.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Oil-Export-Boom-Boosts-Pipeline-Demand.html,"Mar 07, 2018 at 17:00 | Nick Cunningham","Mar 07, 2018",U.S. Oil Export Boom Boosts Pipeline Demand
2018-03-07,"The Permian has been attracting independent U.S. drillers and oil majors who want to capitalize on short-cycle returns in the world’s hottest shale play, but one of the world’s supermajors is not joining the large in-crowd comprised of drillers that are jumping on the shale bandwagon.France’s Total—unlike competitors Exxon, Chevron, and Shell – thinks that the Permian is not the best allocation of capital to create value for the company and its shareholders.Speaking at the CERAWeek in Houston this week, Total’s CEO Patrick Pouyanné told IHS Markit’s Vice Chairman Daniel Yergin that choosing where to invest is a question of allocation of capital.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();“What we learn from this low cycle is that you can’t do everything,” Pouyanné said, adding that it doesn’t make sense for Total and its investors to allocate capital to gain access to the Permian to produce 50,000 bpd of oil.Unlike its competitors, Total doesn’t have a position in the Permian, and it would be quite costly to try to gain one at this point in the game. For this reason, the Permian is not a priority for the French company, according to its chief executive.“I have nothing against the Permian,” Pouyanné was quick to say, adding that “I think it’s an incredible area” for competitors who already have positions there.“For a company like Total, it’s not just a matter of ticking the box to produce 50,000 bpd, it makes no sense,” the CEO said, adding that “when I think of areas of investment, I need to target 200,000 bpd-300,000 bpd if I’m a serious player.”  Related: Shale Pioneer Issues Warning To U.S. Drillers“I don’t think it’s the best allocation of capital. Having said that, never say never, the earth is round…[but] it’s not a priority,” Total’s CEO said at the CERAWeek.On the one hand, Pouyanné’s words highlight the fact that the Permian—dubbed “the world’s hottest shale play”—is now too crowded for latecomers and the cost of accessing acreage is not worth the value that such a position could create. On the other hand, the comments show that Total currently has other priority areas in which to profit so it can return more of those profits to shareholders.Pouyanné said those priority areas are the Middle East, Africa, the North Sea, deepwater, and liquefied natural gas (LNG).“I prefer to spend my money on these five strengths, with the intent to be a leader in each of them,” Pouyanné said.“I strongly believe that for our investors playing to our strengths has much more sense to create value than just trying to fill the gaps.”“I love the Middle East,” Pouyanné said at CERAWeek, noting the low-cost oil and gas positions it has in Abu Dhabi, Qatar, and Iran.In Africa, Total has just boosted its upstream Libyan operations by acquiring the 16.33-percent stake of the Waha oil concessions held by U.S. Marathon Oil Corporation for US$450 million.At CERAWeek, Pouyanné said that this acquisition was “one of the best deals I’ve ever made” because it gave Total access to vast low-cost oil resources. Acknowledging the geopolitical and country-specific risks of doing business in Africa and the Middle East, Pouyanné said that there can’t be opportunities without risks.In the North Sea, the acquisition of Maersk Oil that will close on March 8 is strengthening Total’s business and creates synergies to further push costs down, Pouyanné said.In deepwater, Total sanctioned in December the first large-scale development phase of the Libra project offshore Brazil, with technical costs below $20 a barrel, and last month bought exploration licenses offshore Guyana, where Exxon has just made its seventh oil discovery.In LNG, Total has recently bought Engie’s portfolio of upstream LNG assets, becoming the second-largest global LNG player behind Shell.  Related: Oil Prices Rebound After EIA Reports Build In Crude InventoriesWhile short-cycle oil has been predominantly associated with the Permian, Total has a different concept of ‘short cycle’. For Pouyanné, short cycle means being able to turn on and turn off contractors and capex.Acknowledging that the Permian will continue to boost its production, Total’s CEO still doesn’t think that the area is the best allocation for his company’s capital, especially without any existing position there.In an interview with Bloomberg on the sidelines of CERAWeek, Pouyanné said:“Total today is the most profitable major company without any shale.”By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Only-Oil-Major-Not-Buying-Into-The-Permian.html,"Mar 07, 2018 at 15:33 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Mar 07, 2018",The Only Oil Major Not Buying Into The Permian
2018-03-07,"Malaysian state-owned oil and gas giant Petronas is back in the game. After a series of steps or rather missteps, including being involved in high profile corruption scandals and after receiving a bloody nose from an overbearing and cumbersome approval process in Canada for its now cancelled $36 bn Pacific Northwest LNG export project, the company will ramp up its growth and spending plans this year following a sharp rise in profits.Due to deep spending cuts and higher oil prices, Petronas said net profit for the fourth quarter (Q4) ending in December increased to 18.2 billion ringgit (US$4.65 billion) from 11.3 billion ringgit in the same quarter last year. Q4 revenue rose 13.8 percent to 61.8 billion ringgit. Moreover, the biggest take-away from the Petronas disclosure is yearly profits, up some 91 percent in 2017 from the previous year. This marks the second consecutive year of profitability for the company, following a two-year profit slump – largely coming amid then plunging global oil and gas prices that set the global oil and gas industry on a downward spiral from which is now still recovering from.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();However, Petronas’ 2016 profit growth of 12 percent pales in comparison to this year’s impressive growth. The company’s Profit After Tax (PAT) for 2017 jumped to 45.5 billion ringgit, compared to 23.8 billion ringgit recorded in 2016. The increase was achieved on the back of higher revenue, lower net impairment on assets and well costs and continuous efforts to optimise costs in 2017, Petronas said in a release on March 2.More profits equal more projectsAmid its improved financials, Petronas is now “in a stronger position to execute its long-term growth strategy,” the company said.Related: Oil Prices Rebound After EIA Reports Build In Crude InventoriesThe significance of the Petronas’ disclosure is at least two-fold. First, though the company has made a comeback, global oil and gas prices need to remain near current levels or higher to sustain positive financial results.While it appears that in the near-term, according to most projections, that global oil prices should remain in the high $50s to low $60s range for the balance of the year and into next year, in the now increasingly changing world of oil and gas markets, particularly with US shale oil and gas changing both fundamental and structural market dynamics, nothing can be taken for granted.Petronas President and CEO Wan Zulkiflee also alluded to this when he said that industry wide costs are showing signs of increasing, driven by what he called “premature exuberance” over the oil price recovery. “It is imperative we do not drop the austerity mindset, and continue to ensure we keep costs under control, increase efficiency and drive up value,” he said.Another take-away from the uptick in Petronas profitability is that it could try to go long (again) on gas development in Canada - despite the fact that the firm pulled up stakes there in early 2017.Though Petronas and its project partners cited lower global energy prices as the reason for cancelling its massive CAPEX project, regulatory, environmental and aboriginal resistance in British Columbia, the site of the proposed project, was likely just as much of a determining factor. Media in the western Canadian province at the time said that Petronas’ cancellation was “a tragedy for Canada.”Now, Petronas could choose an easier point of entry into Canada. On Monday, US-oil major Chevron said that it was exploring options including the sale of a minority stake in its Canadian LNG project as it pushes ahead. People familiar with the matter told Reuters that Chevron might sell a stake in its Kitimat LNG project. Petronas is one of the interested parties.If Petronas did indeed secure a stake in the project, which is a 50/50 joint venture with Australia’s Woodside Petroleum, it could help the company’s goal of furthering its LNG footprint away from its own market and region.Related: Shell Outsmarts Competition In The Gulf Of MexicoThe Asia-Pacific region represents around two-thirds of all LNG demand, while that figure will increase as China’s ramps up its usage to at least 10 percent of its energy mix needed for power generation by 2020, per a government mandate. Further increases are earmarked for 2030 and beyond.Second chance at redemptionUntil recently, it seemed that Canada’s LNG export plans had died an untimely death due to governmental red tape, while the upstart U.S.-LNG industry, with less CAPEX intensive projects and an easier approval process, passed it by without even bothering to check its rear view mirror.While, granted, it’s too late for Canada to even come close to matching the U.S.’ impressive LNG run, as the country positions itself to have five major LNG export projects in operation by the end of the decade, and soon after that even challenging top LNG exporters Qatar and Australia, a window is now opening again for Canadian LNG exports. The question remains as before, can Canada step up the plate and deliver?That answer is up to Canadian politicians and officials that need to carefully weigh their regulatory policies and decisions. A second chance like this, albeit in global energy markets, doesn’t often come, while there is a slim chance that if missed again, a third opportunity will present itself.By Tim Daiss for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Malaysian-Petronas-Sees-Profits-Rise-By-91.html,"Mar 07, 2018 at 15:26 | Tim Daiss","Mar 07, 2018",Malaysian Petronas Sees Profits Rise By 91%
2018-03-07,"The Energy Information Administration reported a 2.4-million-barrel build in crude oil inventories for last week. The report’s out a day after the S&P 500 futures dropped 1 percent on the news that President Trump’s advisor Gary Cohn had handed in his resignation – a move seen widely as fueling further worry about a possible global trade war if the United States approves Trump’s proposal for a 25-percent import tariff on steel and a 10-percent levy on aluminum.Weakened by the resignation news, oil prices slid further after the American Petroleum Institute estimated inventories had risen by 5.66 million barrels last week in yet another weekly reminder about the excessive volatility reigning on oil markets.The EIA had some good news, however. The authority reported that gasoline inventories had declined by 800,000 barrels in the reporting period. That compares with a 2.5-million-barrel build in the previous week. Since the start of the year, there has been only one week featuring a decline in gasoline stockpiles, while the total build since then stood at 17.8 million barrels.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Refineries processed 15.9 million barrels of crude per day last week, producing 9.9 million barrels of gasoline daily. Production likely continued to increase last week, just as the International Energy Agency said that the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and Norway can together cover the growth in global oil demand over the next five years. Should this forecast come to pass, OPEC would be hard pressed to continue pumping less oil than before and even that won’t guarantee oil prices remaining at comfortable levels for the cartel’s members.Meanwhile, a heavyweight from the shale oil and gas industry has warned against too much optimism about the future of U.S. oil. EOG Resources’ former boss, Mark Papa, said that the sweetest spots in the Permian and in the wider West Texas patch have already been tapped. What’s more, Papa said, drillers in the shale plays are struggling with shortages of frac sand as they need more and more of it to make wells more productive. Also, Papa said, there are shareholders breathing down drillers’ necks demanding higher returns.WTI was trading at US$61.88 a barrel at the time of writing, and Brent crude was at US$65.13 a barrel.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Prices-Slip-After-EIA-Report-Build-In-Crude-Inventories.html,"Mar 07, 2018 at 09:42 | Irina Slav","Mar 07, 2018",Oil Prices Rebound After EIA Reports Build In Crude Inventories
