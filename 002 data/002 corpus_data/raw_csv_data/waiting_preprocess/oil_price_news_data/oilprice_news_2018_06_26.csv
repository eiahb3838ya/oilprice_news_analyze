2018-06-26,"The Trump administration is going to extreme lengths to disrupt as much oil from Iran as possible, and the implications for the oil market could be severe.When the Obama administration sought to isolate Iran, it built an international coalition, put in place tight sanctions, and tried to curtail Iran’s oil exports. It worked, knocking around 1 million barrels per day offline. Still, the Obama administration granted leeway to an array of countries that depended on Iranian oil, including India, Japan and much of the EU, by granting them exemptions from sanctions as long as they did their best to reduce purchases.The Trump administration has no compunction about making harsh demands to various countries, including U.S. allies, to cut off Iranian oil.The U.S. government is calling on its allies to zero out imports of oil from Iran by November 4, or else face sanctions, and Washington is leaning towards granting no waivers at all. An official from the U.S. State Department said on Tuesday that it had plans to follow up on the matter with Turkey, India and China, even as the U.S. is trying not to “adversely impact” these countries, Bloomberg reports.Late last week, Bloomberg also reported that the U.S. has sent a request to Japan to completely halt imported oil from Iran. Japan imported a little less than 180,000 bpd from Iran in 2017.The fallout from a hard line from Washington could be significant. In the lead up to the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, many analysts predicted that the Trump administration would struggle to match the impact of international sanctions on Iran from 2012 through 2015, particularly because the U.S. would have to do it without the help of the European Union, Russia or China. As such, the thinking was that the Trump administration might only be able to disrupt a few hundred thousand barrels per day of Iranian supply.

WTI is back above $70 per barrel for the first time in over a month.The effect of knocking 1 mb/d of supply offline by the end of the year is hard to overstate. The oil market is already in a deficit situation, with inventories continuing to decline. Venezuela is expected to continue to post production declines, likely losing several hundred thousand barrels per day of supply by the end of the year, at the very least. Surprise outages from Libya, Nigeria and, most recently, Canada came out of nowhere over the last few weeks. Together, all of the disruptions more than overwhelm the 600,000 bpd that OPEC+ is set to add back onto the market.  Related: Power Grab In Libya Threatens Oil IndustryAs such, the oil market was already trending in a bullish direction, but the possible outage of 1 mb/d of supply from Iran would be pretty painful. Recognizing the dangers here, including the potential political fallout, the Trump administration is asking for more oil from major producers.On Monday, U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry said that the increases from the OPEC+ meeting last week “may be a little short” of what is needed to keep the market balanced. Analysts are now speculating that he or other American officials will ask Russia to boost output in order to prevent oil prices from rising too much. Sec. Perry, after all, is set to meet his counterpart, Russian energy minister Alexander Novak, at a natural gas conference in Washington this week. “It’s not a big leap to think he’s going to ask Novak for more oil after today’s commentary,"" John Kilduff of Again Capital told CNBC. Kilduff noted that such a request would be unusual, “but these are strange times.”Previously, the U.S. asked Saudi Arabia to boost output to offset declines from Iran.However, making up for a sudden loss of 1 mb/d, especially when other outages are multiplying, will be exceedingly difficult. In fact, Saudi Arabia and Russia may not be able to account for such sizable losses. That means that the market may have to balance via demand destruction, which is to say, oil prices could be heading much higher.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Jumps-As-Trump-Asks-Allies-To-Cut-Off-Iranian-Oil.html,"Jun 26, 2018 at 17:36 | Nick Cunningham","Jun 26, 2018",Oil Jumps As Trump Asks Allies To Cut Off Iranian Oil
2018-06-26,"When the U.S. Geological Survey published its updated resource estimate for the Wolfcamp Basin in the Permian a couple of years ago, it added fresh fuel to an already major rush to the Permian. Now, the authority has updated its resource estimate for the Eagle Ford, which could spark a similar rush for those whose pockets are deep enough.The USGS said it now estimates undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and gas resources in the Eagle Ford to be around 8.5 billion barrels of crude and 66 trillion cu ft of natural gas, plus 1.9 billion barrels of natural gas liquids.Undiscovered resources are those that are estimated based on geological data and existing reserves in exploitation. They may or may not be commercially viable, unlike technically recoverable resources, which are considered extractable economically with existing technology. In other words, the numbers don’t necessarily mean much in reality.They still sound pretty impressive though, and with Eagle Ford’s long-standing reputation as part of America’s oil heartland, the update is bound to garner attention from drillers with spare cash to tap new resources to see if they are indeed technically recoverable at a low enough cost.This attention will be all the stronger because of drillers’ pipeline woes in the nearby Permian. The star of the U.S. shale revolution is panting under the weight of too much crude pumped and not enough pipelines available to carry it to the Gulf Coast refineries.In the Eagle Ford, the situation is, for the moment, better, and, as Pioneer Natural Resources’ chief executive Scott Sheffield said last week, some drillers will stop drilling in the Permian, but others will pack up and leave. The destination that would make the most sense will be the Eagle Ford.  Related: Power Grab In Libya Threatens Oil IndustryThe Eagle Ford is currently the second-largest producing shale play, with an estimated daily average of 1.364 million bpd in EIA’s latest Drilling Productivity Report. This is expected to rise to 1.396 million bpd next month. The number of active rigs is also rising, from a trough of just 32 at the height of the oil price crisis to 90 today.At the same time, production costs are not all that much higher than the average in the Permian, and let’s not forget that this average covers a wide range of cost levels. In the Eagle Ford, this average is less than US$50 per barrel, and although this is higher than the breakeven of the Permian, the fact that there is more spare pipeline capacity is tempting for drillers having to sell their Permian oil at a steep discount to WTI because of the pipeline constraints.In fact, drillers are already focusing more on the Eagle Ford. This is what ConocoPhillips executive vice president Alan J. Hirshberg said during an earnings call in April: “There’s just been less competition for goods and services in the Eagle Ford and better netbacks because there’ve been less people trying to jam their barrels down the same takeaway capacity. So, everything about the Eagle Ford is really hitting on all cylinders for us.”Colorado drillers are moving into the Permian, there is a pickup in M&A activity in the area, and there are new pipelines being built in the Eagle Ford as well.

According to estimates by the EIA and the Oil and Gas Journal, the 6,200-square-mile area holds 5 billion barrels of oil and 1 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of natural gas.Following the discovery of oil at Wafra in the 1950s, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait agreed to the common ownership of the zone’s oil and gas resources. The resource-sharing principle between the two states has remained in place, even after the countries settled an international boundary in 1969.  Related: Norway’s Oil Discoveries On Track For Best Year Since 2010As of 2015, the oil production capacity in the neutral zone stood at 600,000 bpd, equally divided between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, according to the EIA.Onshore production in the neutral zone is concentrated on the Wafra oil field, which began pumping at the end of 1953. Wafra is the largest of the onshore fields in this neutral zone, with some 4.9 billion barrels in estimated recoverable reserves.

2018-06-26,"OPEC and its non-OPEC partners, including Russia, have agreed to increase oil production after meetings on Friday and Saturday. The production increase will start in July by “measurable” supply boosts, but without specific numbers being given.One of the highlights of the OPEC meeting on Friday was predictable - stark disagreement between OPEC de facto leader Saudi Arabia and regional rival Iran, OPEC’s third largest producer, which likely led to no specific output numbers being agreed upon.However, OPEC and non-OPEC partners did say in statements that they would raise supply by returning to 100 percent compliance with previously agreed output cuts.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said this implied an indirect reallocation of extra production from countries unable to produce more oil to those, such as his own and the other Gulf OPEC members, that are able to do so. He added that OPEC and non-OPEC combined would pump roughly an extra 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in coming months, equal to 1 percent of global supply.Iran’s OPEC governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, however, countered and said that no reallocation was agreed at Saturday’s joint OPEC and non-OPEC meeting or the OPEC-only talks a day earlier.The elephant in the roomWhile global oil markets wait for more concrete data, perhaps a long wait, coming from the 14-member oil producing cartel and its non-OPEC members, the obvious elephant in the room over a more cohesive OPEC deal is Iranian angst over Riyadh’s support, even backroom diplomatic push, for President Donald Trump’s decision to re-impose sanctions against Iran over its nuclear development.  Related: This Is Aramco’s Spare Production CapacityIran has also ratcheted up its disapproval of the Trump Administration in recent weeks as the Islamic Republic tries in vain for global support to offset coming economic sanctions that are already impacting the country’s ability to cut international business deals, including French oil major Total’s impending exit from Iran due to its heavy reliance on U.S. markets for debt financing. Most other international companies, when faced with alienating the U.S. or choosing sides with Iran, have little choice but to follow Total’s example.Other international firms preparing to exit Iran or least putting their plans on hold due to renewed sanctions include Russian oil giant Lukoil. Reliance Industries, the Indian company that owns the world's largest oil refining complex, will also stop buying oil from Iran.Meanwhile, just after OPEC wrapped up its meeting on Friday in Vienna, Iran pressed its media attack on Washington.""Trump makes two mistakes,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh told reporters.“The first one is that he thinks that he will witness regime change in Iran very soon which is a big mistake; and his second mistake is that he thinks there is a capacity in the world for a major excess production (of oil). This is also a mistake,” he said.Iran has said previously it will remain committed to the 2015 nuclear deal reached with western powers for the time being, pending negotiations with other signatories of the agreement to see if Iran’s interests would still be protected under an accord without the U.S.However, given that Iran has already tried to press EU members for more action both collectively and individually with minimal success, as well as appealing to OPEC for help, there is a real chance that Iran will break its terms of the 2015 deal, raising the geopolitical stakes with the U.S. as well as furthering tensions with Riyadh both within OPEC and while jockeying for regional hegemony in the region.  Related: A Storm Is Brewing In The Southern Gas CorridorThe obvious about-face by Saudi Arabia amid recent pressure from Trump to increase oil production and reign in oil prices also causes considerable anger with Iranian leaders, as does what can be called a re-renewed U.S.-Saudi partnership.Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei pointed this out recently when he accused the U.S. of working to “provoke” Saudi Arabia against Iran.“Americans are trying to provoke Saudi Arabia against Tehran ... Their aim is to create more regional crisis ... to push Muslims to fight against Muslims,” Khamenei said, according to a report by Reuters.“If these governments gain more wisdom, they will not confront Iran. If they confront Iran, they will be defeated.”However, given the growing divergence between Tehran and Riyadh and an emboldened Saudi Arabia amid Trump’s hawkish middle east policies and renewed sanctions decision, the recent OPEC agreement to increase production and any real numbers and compliance to those numbers could take considerably more work.By Tim Daiss for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Iran-Blames-OPEC-For-Vague-Output-Agreement.html,"Jun 26, 2018 at 10:48 | Tim Daiss","Jun 26, 2018",Iran Blames OPEC For Vague Output Agreement
