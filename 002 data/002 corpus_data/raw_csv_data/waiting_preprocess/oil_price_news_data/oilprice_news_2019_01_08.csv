2019-01-08,"While even the most likely new pipeline to ship more of Alberta’s crude oil to refining and export markets—Enbridge’s Line 3 replacement—is nearly a year away at the earliest, the province hosting most of Canada’s oil production has been desperately seeking other ways to get more value for its natural resources.Alberta is looking to boost the crude-by-rail capacity to transport an additional 120,000 bpd of its oil over the next three years. In the most drastic measure yet, the province mandated an oil production cut of 325,000 bpd for three months starting January 2019, to clear the current glut and lift record-low Canadian heavy oil prices.Alberta is also looking to another solution to alleviate the crude oil glut—having a new oil refinery built in the province that would absorb part of the crude and unlock some space on congested pipelines shipping oil out of the province.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Analysts, however, are not convinced that a new refinery would help much to clear the oil glut. First, Alberta’s current refineries already produce more than enough gasoline and diesel to meet local demand. Second, any excess of fuel has to be moved out of the province, too. Shipping those products to markets faces similar issues like the current crude oil takeaway capacity bottlenecks. Third, those refined products would have to compete for a share on a flat or declining North American fuel market, where U.S. refineries already produce more gasoline and other refined products than America consumes.

The Alberta government will accept expressions of interest until February 8 and will consider interest in new greenfield investments or an expansion of facilities at an existing brownfield site.Alberta’s government didn’t specify how it would support the project. Yet, even if it were to follow up the expression-of-interest stage with “issuing a Request for Proposals to construct a new refinery,” the potential new project would take years to complete and start up production.“Building a new refinery would create good-paying, long-term jobs for Albertans. New refining capacity would also help lower the oil price differential over the long term, protecting the province from a lack of capacity to export oil, and making sure we get full value for the energy resources owned by all Albertans,” the statement seeking industry interest said.Alberta has four operating refineries and a new one starting up any time now. The Suncor Refinery in Edmonton, the Imperial Oil Refinery in Edmonton, the Shell Canada Refinery in Scotford, and the Husky Asphalt Refinery in Lloydminster have a total capacity of 454,000 bpd, while the Sturgeon Refinery of the North West Redwater Partnership (NWR) has started up some units and is set to start commercial production this year. The refinery will have a capacity to process 79,000 bpd, increasing total Alberta refinery capacity to 533,000 bpd.

If you can’t get your egress solved by then, you’ve got a problem,” Birn told Bloomberg.  While more refining capacity in Alberta could alleviate the crude oil glut—if it still exists in four or five years—it could create more fuel oversupply that would need access to markets anyway. What’s certain is that a new refinery tomorrow won’t ease Alberta’s crude oil excess today.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-This-The-Answer-To-Canadas-Oil-Crisis.html,"Jan 08, 2019 at 17:26 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Jan 08, 2019",Is This The Answer To Canada’s Oil Crisis?
2019-01-08,"After the United States pulled out of the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal and re-imposed and added to sanctions last year, the Trump administration granted waivers to eight countries who were already established buyers to continue buying specified amounts of Iranian oil for 180 days. Now, however, a senior Iranian energy official in Tehran says that these countries are not making use of the waivers and are instead complying fully with the strict zero-oil sanctions.According to Iran's deputy oil minister for trade and international affairs Amir Hossein Zamaninia, ""China, India, Japan, South Korea and other countries that were granted waivers from America to import Iranian oil are not willing to buy even one barrel more from Iran."" The “other countries” granted waivers by the United States are Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey.On the surface this sounds like devastating news for Iran, which is already struggling with a lagging economy, increasingly tense regional relations, unrest within the ranks of the current regime, and widespread protests. The Rouhani administration in Iran made the nuclear deal, also known as Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a major part of their platform and as therefore lost a considerable amount of support from its own constituents in the wake of the deal’s dissolution. In spite of this, Zamaninia is optimistic, quoted by the Oil Ministry's news agency SHANA as saying that Tehran has no shortage of prospective buyers for their oil. In fact, Zamaninia says that number of interested countries has significantly increased thanks to a competitive market.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Iran does have some notable allies in the face of the renewed sanctions. The Rouhani administration has been working on strengthening these relations with economic powerhouses such as Russia and India. While Iran’s relationship with Russia has been somewhat tenuous, they have been allies in Syria in support of the Assad regime, and more importantly Russia is a willing candidate for undermining U.S. sanctions. Iran also has a strong relationship with India, which has found a way to keep trading in Iranian crude oil by way of banking loopholes involving five escrow accounts in Iranian banks.  Related: What Apple’s Tailspin Means For Oil PricesIn addition to these somewhat tentative alliances, the European Union strongly opposed the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and despite tense relations with Tehran has been consistently resistant to comply with U.S. sanctions. Tehran is now urging those European countries still committed to holding up their end of the nuclear deal to further oppose the sanctions by setting up a financial system known as SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle for trade) that would facilitate payments for sale of Iranian oil.In the meantime, the U.S. has stood strong with the revamped sanctions with a stated purpose of curbing Iran’s missile and nuclear programs and to push back against the nation’s increasing military presence and political influence throughout the middle east. In the face of the U.S.’s unflinching position, Tehran admits that even the support of the European Union may not be enough to sidestep the sanctions. Zamaninia says that even if the SPV financial mechanism is instated, it would be ""helpful but could not resolve the problems since U.S. influence will affect any European action"".Meanwhile, the oil sanction waivers--whether the receiving countries are making use of them are not--don’t expire until March, when President Trump will announce whether or not the original six-month waiver will be extended. If no more waivers are granted and the other countries purportedly interested in Iranian oil don’t start buying in considerable quantities, Iran’s next best hope is for a more nuclear-deal friendly regime change in the United States in 2020.In the end, waivers and elections in the United States may be too little too late for Iran, as the nation’s economy has already taken a huge hit that has caused the nation’s disillusioned citizens to lash out against the current regime and even take to the streets, chanting “Our enemy is right here, it is not the U.S.”By Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-Iran-Exaggerating-The-Demand-For-Its-Oil.html,"Jan 08, 2019 at 15:27 | Haley Zaremba","Jan 08, 2019",Is Iran Exaggerating The Demand For Its Oil?
2019-01-08,"The news that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has placed a US$93-million order with Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company for the deepening and widening of its ship channel at the Port of Corpus Christi (PortCC) broke last week in what was still a sluggish news environment. But it is significant news: this is the first step the federal U.S. government has made to support efforts to boost crude oil exports and it is also the first step in a competition dance between the Port of Corpus Christi and commodity major Trafigura.Energy analyst David Blackmon noted the significance of the contract in a recent story for Forbes, adding it was part of a bigger port expansion project that would require US$360 million in funding. The port authority’s determination to see this project through despite the bulky price tag was made evident by its willingness to tap the debt market for the first time in its history and cough up US$130 million for the expansion. The rest would have to come from the federal government.Why expand? Because U.S. crude oil exports are on the rise and will continue to be on the rise for some time, potentially reaching 4 to 5 million barrels daily. For context, this compares with last year’s all-time high of 2 million bpd, touched briefly in the first half of the year.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();As exports rise it would make sense to cut loading costs by using larger tankers. However, there is only one port in the United States at the moment that can load Very large Crude Carriers, the monsters that can carry up to 2 million barrels of crude. This is the Louisiana offshore oil port and it mostly handles imports, hence the urgent need for more export terminals.Corpus Christi can also—partially—handle VLCCs: part of the load can be pumped into them at the port but once it reaches a certain level the VLCC needs to move into the deeper waters of the Gulf of Mexico and have the rest of the cargo loaded by barges. The U.S. Army Corps’ channel dredging will make it possible for VLCC to use it and load crude at a terminal yet to be built by PortCC.  Related: New Data Suggests Shocking Shale SlowdownPortCC wants this expansion to happen as quickly as possible: last year Trafigura threw its hat in the ring with a proposal to build an oil export terminal off Padre Island, to the south of Corpus Christi, threatening the future profitability of PortCC’s own expansion plans. There are also others planning export terminals in Texas and Louisiana.“It’s the new Wild Wild West for crude midstream is that everybody wants to throw their hat in and have their own project,” the Houston Chronicle quoted a Wood Mackenzie analyst as saying last September. Indeed, the rush is on as production continues up although a certain slowdown in growth is possible this year as a result of the latest oil price slide. This production growth will soon get a boost from new pipelines coming on stream, supporting not just prices but greatly improving the time and costs of getting the crude to export terminals.PortCC is being backed by Carlyle Group in its expansion plans, with the terminal slated to begin operation in 2020. Yet it will be hard work: the regulatory process around building an oil-loading terminal is very complex and on top of that, the contestants in the oil export capacity race would need to deal with problems such as workforce shortages, Reuters noted in a report from October last year.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Army-Joins-Race-To-Expand-US-Oil-Exports.html,"Jan 08, 2019 at 13:42 | Irina Slav","Jan 08, 2019",U.S. Army Joins Race To Expand U.S. Oil Exports
2019-01-08,"Global transportation demand for crude oil is expected to peak in the late 2020s, due to the rise of electric vehicles (EVs), improved efficiency standards for internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, and consumer preferences, Wood Mackenzie said in a recent note.Most major oil companies and analysts also believe that by the late 2020s crude oil demand for transportation fuels will stop growing. As a result, major refiners are preparing for a petrochemical future of their crude oil refining processes to replace part of their gasoline, diesel, and other distillates production after 2030.“Many oil production and refining companies are emphasising chemicals - particularly olefins and aromatics - as a key target area for future crude oil long-term demand growth,” wrote Steve Zinger, Senior Vice President, Petrochemicals, at WoodMac.Major oil firms, including ExxonMobil, Saudi Aramco, and Sabic, are developing crude-oil-to-chemicals technologies, while many traditional oil refineries will consider retrofitting to maximize production of chemical feedstocks rather than transportation fuels, the energy consultancy said.According to recent estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA), petrochemicals are expected to account for more than a third of global oil demand growth to 2030, and nearly half the growth to 2050, adding nearly 7 million bpd by then. Petrochemicals “will have a greater influence on the future of oil demand than cars, trucks and aviation,” the IEA’s Executive Director Fatih Birol said in October 2018.  Related: Has U.S. Fracking Activity Peaked Already?According to a WoodMac analysis from a few months ago, the EV share of the global car fleet is still miniscule, considering that the world’s stock of cars is 1.2 billion units. But battery costs and range are less and less the stumbling blocks in EV adoption. Battery is one third of the cost of an EV today. Yet, costs have already declined by 80 percent this decade and will fall further. Battery pack prices will drop below US$200/kWh this year and then fall by around 10 percent each year, WoodMac said in July.“The critical threshold is US$100/kWh – that’s when EVs will compete on commercial terms with ICE vehicles. We think we’ll get there by 2027,” WoodMac says.EVs will displace around 5 million bpd to 6 million bpd of oil demand by 2040—some 5 percent of total oil demand, the consultancy has estimated. By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/WoodMac-Demand-For-Oil-In-Transportation-Sector-To-Peak-In-A-Decade.html,"Jan 08, 2019 at 10:30 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Jan 08, 2019",WoodMac: Demand For Oil In Transportation Sector To Peak In A Decade
