2018-03-14,"After plunging oil bulls into deeper gloom by forecasting a 131,000-bpd jump in shale oil production next month, the Energy Information Administration reported a 5-million-barrel increase in crude oil inventories for the week to March 9—in stark contrast to yesterday’s API figures.This compares with a 2.4-million-barrel build reported last week and analyst expectations of a 560,000-bpd increase. A day earlier, the American Petroleum Institute reported an estimated 1.156-million-barrel inventory increase for the period.In gasoline, the authority gave market players some respite, saying that inventories had fallen by whopping 6.3 million barrels, after an 800,000-barrel decline a week earlier. Gasoline inventories have been rising for most of the time since the start of the year, with just two weekly declines so far, to the tune of 2.8 million barrels. This is the third gasoline inventory decline since January.Refineries processed 16.4 million barrels of crude daily last week, up from 15.9 million bpd a week earlier. Gasoline production averaged 10.3 million barrels daily, compared with 9.9 million bpd in the week to March 2.Prices have been moving lower pretty consistently in the last couple of weeks as worry deepens that growing U.S. shale oil production is undermining OPEC and Russia’s cuts. There are even suspicions the cartel might choose to end the deal earlier than December 2018 as internal disagreements pit Iran against Saudi Arabia yet again. Iran feels fine with benchmarks around US$60, while the Kingdom needs higher prices to make the Aramco IPO a success.The EIA is not helping: in its latest Drilling productivity Report, the authority forecast that shale oil production will hit 6.954 million barrels daily next month, pulling the U.S. total also higher. This was bound to aggravate concern about the OPEC deal and intensify internal tensions in the cartel.At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at US$64.71 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate was at US$60.87 a barrel, with some analysts cautioning U.S. crude could slip below US$60 if the rate of production growth continues and no new tailwind presents itself.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/EIA-Stuns-Oil-Market-With-Huge-Inventory-Build.html,"Mar 14, 2018 at 09:45 | Irina Slav","Mar 14, 2018",EIA Stuns Oil Market With Huge Inventory Build
2018-03-14,"Ageing fields and high production costs dragged down China’s domestic crude oil production in January and February, on par with the lowest level on record according to Chinese government data.In the first two months of 2018, China’s crude oil production dropped by 1.9 percent from the same period last year to average 3.76 million barrels per day, according to Reuters calculations of data by China’s National Bureau of Statistics. The production level in January and February equaled the lowest on record since at least 2011, a level which was hit again in August last year.Much of the production decline so far this year could be attributed to the drop in production of China’s largest oil producer, China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), whose production fell by 1.6 percent year on year, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();CNPC has reduced production at some oil fields and expects domestic production to gradually decline, according to the source.The top Chinese oil producer will target to pump 100 million tons of crude oil—equal to around 2 million bpd—this year, flat compared to 2017, Reuters’ source said.Last year, CNPC’s major oil field Daqing saw its production drop by 7 percent compared to 2016, as CNPC’s unit PetroChina, the operator of the field, scaled back oil production due to high costs, despite the rise in oil prices.

In addition, production from assets that Chinese state oil companies own abroad now exceeds domestic production, increasing the country’s dependency on foreign oil.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Chinese-Oil-Production-Hits-Record-Low.html,"Mar 14, 2018 at 09:26 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Mar 14, 2018",Chinese Oil Production Hits Record Low
