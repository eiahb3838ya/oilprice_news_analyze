2018-02-07,"Shale executives have gone to great lengths to convince investors that they will not drill aggressively now that oil prices have rallied into the $60s. But in a new report released on Tuesday, the EIA essentially said that those assurances are just a lot of hot air.The EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook predicted that U.S. oil production would top 11 million barrels per day (mb/d) this year. Last month, the agency said that the U.S. wouldn’t hit that threshold until November 2019.The revision from just a few weeks ago is dramatic. In January the EIA estimated that the U.S. would surpass 10 mb/d at some point in February. But recently published data shows that the U.S. actually hit that milestone last November, and now, the agency says the U.S. actually averaged 10.2 mb/d in January.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();On an annual basis, the U.S. produced 9.3 mb/d last year, a figure that is set to jump to 10.6 mb/d for 2018. Things slow down a bit in 2019, with an average of 11.2 mb/d.What do we make of all of this? Well, the shale industry is clearly drilling at a frenzied pace, with an increasing concentration in the Permian basin. The rig count continues to rise in the Permian, while remaining mostly flat elsewhere. So far, the Permian has shown no signs of slowing down, despite some evidence of bottlenecking and cost inflation. Production continues to rise at a scorching rate.  Related: Oil Prices Fall On Rising Crude InventoriesThe big question at this point is how rapidly expanding shale production will interact with the pace of inventory builds/declines and the OPEC production limits. Some analysts, including Goldman Sachs and S&P Global Platts, recently raised the prospect of OPEC tightening the oil market too much, allowing inventories to drain well below the five-year average.The massive upward revision in shale production from the EIA might dampen those concerns. The EIA says that inventories will build by an average of 0.2 mb/d over the course of 2018 and 2019, and the agency predicts Brent will average just $62 per barrel this year.Meanwhile, global financial turmoil is testing oil prices. WTI and Brent have retreated from recent highs over the last few trading days, dragged down by the global selloff. The enormous build up in bullish bets from hedge funds and other money managers presents a deeper downside risk.But Goldman Sachs shrugged off the instability, and reiterated its bullish case for commodities for this year. In fact, the selloff increases the odds of more gains in the months ahead, Goldman analysts argue. “Commodities proved to work just as advertised” during the sudden selloff in equities, Jeffrey Currie, the bank’s head of commodities research, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “In fact, you saw base metals and gold trade up as the equity market went down.”  Related: The World’s Biggest Oil Benchmark Could Change Forever“Historically, when you look at commodities they perform very well during rate-hiking cycles,” Currie said. “Oil’s what we called backwardated, where spot prices sit above forward prices, so you buy at a discount and roll up the curve. In other words, it pays you to be long.” The investment bank says there is no reason to abandon the bullish case for commodities for this year. Goldman predicts Brent will top $82 per barrel within six months.If that is the case, then surely the shale industry will accelerate drilling. After all, the EIA sees the industry adding upwards of 1 mb/d between January and December.Still, it might be too soon to tell if shale drillers are going to abandon those claims of restraint. Goldman Sachs said in a research note that the most recent spending plans and guidance published by a select few shale drillers does not necessarily point to a drill-at-all-costs mentality. Goldman looked at 8 shale companies that released specifics, and the capex and production estimates from those companies are about equal to consensus estimates. In other words, the recent rally in oil prices has not significantly altered the approach of the shale industry for 2018, at least not yet.The EIA’s latest prediction, however, assumes the shale industry throws caution to the wind. The U.S. could hit 11 mb/d in 2018, a full year earlier than previously expected.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Oil-Production-Is-Rising-Much-Faster-Than-Expected.html,"Feb 07, 2018 at 17:28 | Nick Cunningham","Feb 07, 2018",U.S. Oil Production Is Rising Much Faster Than Expected
2018-02-07,"The Permian has increased its oil production more than any other shale basin in recent years, and it even had its production growing when all other U.S. shale plays were scaling back production during the downturn.Drilling in the Permian in West Texas and eastern New Mexico has grown so much that the basin now has a spare production capacity second only to Saudi Arabia’s — capacity that Permian drillers could bring online in days.Producers active in the Permian have at least 500,000 bpd of spare production capacity that could even be as much as 1 million bpd, Nansen Saleri, former head of reservoir management at Saudi Aramco and now CEO at Houston-based consultant Quantum Reservoir Impact, has told Bloomberg.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();This estimate highlights the increased importance that U.S. shale — especially in the Permian — could play as a ‘swing producer’ on the global oil market.“For decades there was one country and one company that had spare capacity and that country was Saudi Arabia and that company was Saudi Aramco,” Saleri told Bloomberg. “Now we are seeing an analog to that in the Permian,” he noted.Saudi Arabia’s spare oil production capacity is estimated to be around 1.5 million bpd, according to data collected by Bloomberg.Historically, OPEC’s kingpin Saudi Arabia has had the greatest spare capacity in the world, and has usually kept more than 1.5–2 million bpd of spare capacity on hand for market management, according to the EIA, which defines spare capacity as the volume of production that can be brought on within 30 days and sustained for at least 90 days.  Related: Statoil: Rising U.S. Shale To Keep Oil Prices Below $70 In 2018According to Saleri, the Permian is capable of turning on the taps to respond to higher demand in three to four days, faster than any other field in the world — except for those operated by Saudi Aramco.Like everyone else, the former manager at Aramco also expects the Permian oil production to grow substantially and reach at least 3 million bpd in a year, as less efficient drillers have left the game and only the most efficient drillers are staying.“If operators believe that oil prices will stay above $60 for the coming six months they will go on a drilling program,” Saleri told Bloomberg.EIA’s latest available Drilling Productivity Report shows that the Permian oil production will grow to 2.870 million bpd in February, up by 76,000 bpd from January, contributing the most to the production growth in the key U.S. shale areas. In the February Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) published on Tuesday, the EIA estimates that U.S. crude oil production averaged 10.2 million bpd in January, up 100,000 bpd compared to December. Total U.S. crude oil production is now expected to average 10.6 million bpd in 2018, beating by 1 million bpd the previous annual production record set in 1970. Next year, U.S. crude oil production is seen averaging 11.2 million bpd.The Permian is expected to be the main contributor to U.S. production growth in the next few years.Since 2010, Permian production increases have averaged 14.8 percent per year, according to estimates by the Dallas Fed. The share of the Permian in total U.S. oil production has also significantly increased over the past five years, with the Permian Basin accounting for 26.9 percent of U.S. oil in October 2017, up from 18.1 percent in 2013.  Related: The World’s Biggest Oil Benchmark Could Change ForeverThis year, the International Energy Agency (IEA) expects “explosive growth” in the U.S., with America overtaking the world’s second-largest oil producer Saudi Arabia and rivaling the top oil producer Russia, provided that the OPEC/non-OPEC deal to curb production remains throughout 2018.The Permian will undoubtedly play the leading role in the expected U.S. production growth, although the pace of that growth will depend on many factors, such as oil prices, capex plans, spending discipline, or cost curves. According to the former Saudi Aramco executive, the most prolific U.S. shale basin has large spare capacity — second only to Saudi Arabia’s. This makes the Permian potentially capable of playing the swing producer role on global oil markets.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Should-The-Saudis-Fear-The-Permians-Production-Potential.html,"Feb 07, 2018 at 17:21 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Feb 07, 2018",Should The Saudis Fear The Permian’s Production Potential?
2018-02-07,"Amid positive comments from OPEC on the global oil supply situation and indications that some members of the cartel are ready for a longer extension of the production cut deal, Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh has sparked uncertainty with his proclamation that Iran could raise its oil production in a matter of days should OPEC decide to scrap the deal at its meeting in June.Speaking to media in Tehran during the weekend, Zanganeh said the country’s crude oil production could jump by 100,000 bpd within “five or six days” should the cartel decide that prices are high enough to stop curbing its production.There has been talk from analysts that prices may be getting too high for OPEC’s and Russia’s comfort, but OPEC officials and Russia’s Alexander Novak have been true to the official party line: the cuts will continue to the end of 2018. The latest to comment on the state of affairs was OPEC’s Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo, who said that ""OECD commercial oil inventories have steadily fallen to stand 140 million barrels above the five-year average in October,” adding that ""our determination and hard work are paying off.""googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Iran was allowed to cap its production rather than cut it, with OPEC even allowing it a slight increase, of 90,000 bpd to 3.975 million bpd. But according to Bloomberg data, last month Iran produced less than that, at 3.83 million bpd. The country also recently closed two oil swap deals with Russia and Iraq, and, as analyst Ellen Wald noted in a recent article for Investing.com, these would amount to a combined 160,000 bpd, which doesn’t leave a lot of free production capacity to match Zanganeh’s statement.  Related: LNG: Glut Today, Shortage TomorrowOf course, Iran is far from the most transparent country, so the minister may well know something the rest of the world doesn’t. On the other hand, over the first ten months of this fiscal year, Iran’s oil and condensate production already rose by 165,000 bpd, also according to the minister. That’s a 165,000-bpd increase over ten months. It’s difficult to believe Iran has the resources to add another 100,000 bpd in just a few days.What’s more, the chances of OPEC ending the deal prematurely seem remote. They may draw closer in the coming months if U.S. producers continue to ramp up production at the current rate, which prompted the Energy Information Administration to revise upwards its forecasts for this year and next. Now, the EIA expects production to hit the 11 million bpd mark later this year, reaching an average 11.2 million in 2019.And that’s not all. Now American oil has flowed to the Middle East, and more specifically the UAE. If something like this — something as unthinkable as this — can happen, then OPEC can’t feel safe even on its home turf, which could lead to some decision changes by June.Iran certainly wants the deal gone so it can continue growing its production, especially as its crude enjoys a rally that has pushed it close to the price of Brent. So, Zanganeh is gladly stoking the fire under his fellow OPEC members. “If we want to make a decision, it has to be at the right time, which is June — when we’ll next meet,” he said. “But my impression is that OPEC members are not after very expensive oil because very expensive oil leads to mid-term price fluctuations.”By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Iran-Could-Add-100000-bpd-In-Five-Or-Six-Days.html,"Feb 07, 2018 at 16:50 | Irina Slav","Feb 07, 2018","Iran Could Add 100,000 Bpd In “Five Or Six Days”"
2018-02-07,"ExxonMobil was forced to finally acknowledge the possibility that future climate change policy could lead to peak oil demand, a serious threat to the company’s operations over the long-term.In response to a shareholder resolution passed last year, the oil major just released a report that recognizes the danger of peak oil demand. By 2040, climate change policies and regulations could cut into oil demand, leading to a drop in consumption by 20 percent.Under this scenario, oil demand would decline by an average of 0.4 percent per year, with the lower end of the range seeing declines of 1.7 percent per year.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();This would mean that global oil demand would decline to 78 million barrels per day (mb/d) by 2040, down from 95 mb/d in 2016. In the most pessimistic scenario (from the oil industry’s perspective), demand drops to 53 mb/d.It’s a rather bleak picture for oil, and one echoed by a long list of analysts, environmental groups, and increasingly, the oil industry itself. A few weeks ago, a report coauthored by a top BP official, lays out a case in which oil demand peaks and declines, ushering in an era of permanently lower oil prices.Still, Exxon was clearly issuing the report under duress. The tone of Exxon’s “2°C pathway” scenario suggests that the company doesn’t really see it playing out. While the report suggests that oil demand could fall, Exxon goes to great lengths to downplay the significance, arguing that “[o]il demand is projected to decline modestly on average, and much more slowly than its natural rate of decline from existing producing fields,” and “[e]ven under a 2°C pathway, significant investment will be required in oil and natural gas capacity,” and “[p]roduction from our proved reserves and investment in our resources continue to be needed to meet global requirements,” and the like.  Related: Oil Prices Fall On Rising Crude InventoriesMoreover, the oil major issued a second report, “2018 Outlook for Energy,” that basically undercut its own report on a low-carbon future. In this more bullish report, Exxon predicted oil demand would rise by 20 percent through 2040, essentially the opposite conclusion from the scenario in which climate policy slashes oil demand.We can tell which one Exxon really believes because it says it uses the more bullish Outlook for Energy report “to help inform our long-term business strategies and investment plans.”(Click to enlarge)Ultimately, Exxon predicts that it will be able to produce 90 percent of the total oil and gas reserves that it has in its portfolio. The company also says that even in the climate scenarios in which demand falls, ongoing investment will be needed to offset depletion from existing fields. So, even in that case, the oil major still believes that it will produce nearly all of the oil and gas it has on its books.  Related: LNG: Glut Today, Shortage TomorrowThat is the justification for why Exxon envisions “little risk” related to climate change policies. Exxon says that only a small portion of its reserves would be affected by climate policy, but in those situations the company believes “that investments could mitigate production-related emissions and associated costs,” which could make them viable even in a carbon-constrained world.Plus, the company would learn a lot more about the reserves in the ensuing decades. “Accordingly, we believe the production of these reserves will likely remain economic even under the 2°C Scenarios Average.”As a result, Exxon does not see a scenario in which it will be forced to leave oil in the ground — it plans to produce everything it has, even in the face of tightening climate regulations.Environmental groups say that is exactly the problem. “ExxonMobil’s own analysis assumes the world will continue to burn through oil and gas to drive their profits and keep us on a path toward global temperatures well above the 2 degree Celsius target,” Kathy Mulvey, a campaign manager at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg. “Nowhere do they foresee carbon emissions bending rapidly toward zero — as they must well before 2040,” she wrote.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Exxon-To-Produce-All-Of-Its-Oil-Despite-Peak-Demand-Fears.html,"Feb 07, 2018 at 14:43 | Nick Cunningham","Feb 07, 2018",Exxon To Produce All Of Its Oil Despite Peak Demand Fears
2018-02-07,"A cargo of U.S. condensate has reached Abu Dhabi in the latest sign how much the oil market has changed in the last few years. The 700,000-barrel cargo, Bloomberg reports, was bought in December from US-based Enterprise Product Partners. This is the first U.S. cargo to be shipped to the Middle East.Although the news is significant inasmuch as it indicates the United States’ strengthening position on international oil markets, it is unlikely that U.S. condensate imports into the UAE will become a regular thing, according to at least one analyst.The head of Lipow Oil Associates, Andy Lipow, told Bloomberg that “As a member of OPEC and a large crude producer, I would imagine they would be very self-sufficient in their own crude supply.”googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Yet, its condensate supply came mostly from Qatar before the Saudi-led blockade, in which the UAE also took an active part as a firm supporter of the Kingdom.The UAE produced around 2.87 million bpd of crude oil in January, in line with its production quota under the OPEC supply cut deal. At the end of the month, the Energy Minister announced the state oil company ADNOC will further reduce production to comply with the deal.

Last month, the EIA reports, these averaged 1.4 million bpd, versus half this amount a year earlier. This increase was one of the factors that supported oil prices in late 2017 as it led to drawdowns in U.S. oil inventories – a closely watched gauge of supply and demand.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Market-Makes-Major-Shift-As-US-Oil-Heads-To-Middle-East.html,"Feb 07, 2018 at 09:01 | Irina Slav","Feb 07, 2018",Oil Market Makes Major Shift As US Oil Heads To Middle East
