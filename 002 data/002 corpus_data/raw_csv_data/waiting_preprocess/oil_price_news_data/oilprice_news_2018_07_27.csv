2018-07-27,"The fastest-growing oil region in the U.S. is fueling not only the second American shale revolution—it’s fueling a subculture of drug and alcohol abuse among oil field workers.The Permian shale play in West Texas is once again booming with drilling and is full of oil field workers, some of which are abusing drugs and alcohol to help them get through long shifts, harsh working conditions, and loneliness and isolation.Drugs are easily accessible in the Permian, which is close to highways and to Mexico. For oil field workers making six-figure salaries, money is not a problem to buy all kinds of illegal substances to shoot, snort and swallow to get through 24-hour-plus shifts. The physically exhaustive work also sometimes causes aches for workers, making them susceptible to getting hooked on prescription painkillers.The drug and alcohol abuse subculture in the Permian is a known—yet rarely reported or discussed—issue in the most prolific U.S. shale play, where oil production is booming, and relentless drilling attracts oil field workers from all over Texas and all parts of the United States.In Midland, in the very heart of the Permian oil boom, The Springboard Center—a drug and alcohol addiction treatment facility—has many clients from the oil fields, Christopher Pierce, director of marketing for center, tells Rigzone’s Valerie Jones in an interview.“We get a lot of clients who work in the oilfield because of where we’re located,” says Pierce, 35, a former oil field worker, and a former addict.Pierce and The Springboard Center in Midland are now working on building a gated living camp community free of drugs or alcohol for people who want to be in a safe place.  Related: The Three Best Oil Majors Of 2018Oil workers are not speaking up at work about their addiction for fear of getting fired, Pierce said, adding that he doesn’t have anything negative to say about the oil industry, which is the backbone of the economic growth in the Permian.Some oil field workers and contractors use drug cocktails or various substances depending on the condition they seek to achieve during their 24-hour-plus shifts. At the beginning of a long or overnight shift, they would use ‘uppers’ like cocaine and methamphetamines, and finish the shift with ‘downers’ such as prescription medication or alcohol, Kayla Fishbeck, regional evaluator for Prevention Resource Center Region 9, a data repository for 30 counties in West Texas, told Rigzone.“In Region 9, the most screened drug last year was amphetamines and that was largely in the oilfield,” she said.Thanks to the oil boom, the unemployment rate in Midland is at a record low 2.1 percent, and the unemployment rate in Odessa is also a historically low of 2.8 percent.According to law firm Sutliff and Stout, Midland and Odessa are the top two Texas cities for drunken-driving fatalities.“We hear stories of guys getting off their shift, getting a six-pack or 12-pack on their way home and start drinking in their truck,” Fishbeck told Rigzone.  Related: The Most Important Waterway In The Oil WorldThe Permian’s drug of choice is crystal meth, a stimulant increasingly supplied by Mexican drug cartels, according to law enforcement officials who spoke to the Houston Chronicle in May.There is a strong correlation between the rise of drilling activity and the number of crystal meth seizures by authorities in the Permian area, Houston Chronicle’s cross-analysis of data from the Texas Department of Public Safety and the rig count shows.Eddy Lozoya, a former oil field trucker and a recovering addict at 23, has recently found a job at a local department store selling shoes. At least for the next few months, he doesn’t plan to return to the oil field.“I don’t see myself being able to work 100 hours a week sober,” he told the Houston Chronicle. “The oil field is tough.”By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Coke-Meth-And-Booze-The-Flip-Side-Of-The-Permian-Oil-Boom.html,"Jul 27, 2018 at 15:34 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Jul 27, 2018","Coke, Meth And Booze: The Flip Side Of The Permian Oil Boom"
2018-07-27,"The shale industry is on the verge of becoming profitable…for the first time.“Higher prices and operational improvements are putting the US shale sector on track to achieve positive free cash flow in 2018 for the first time ever,” the International Energy Agency (IEA) wrote in a recent report on energy investment.For years, drilling in the shale patch was like running on a treadmill. The precipitous decline in production from shale – the average shale well produces about 80 percent of its oil in the first two years of operation – meant that companies had to keep drilling new wells just to keep production flat. The cash used from one well was injected back into the ground to produce from a new well.Ultimately, shareholders forgave the lack of profits in the hopes that continuous growth would one day lead to juicy returns. The growth-at-all-costs model convinced Wall Street for a while, and money poured into the sector. Triple-digit oil prices in the period between 2010 and 2014 reassured both oil drillers and their financial backers.Over that half-decade, investment quadrupled, and production from shale grew by eightfold from 0.44 million barrels per day to 3.6 mb/d, which represented “the fastest growth in oil production in a single country since the development of Saudi Arabia’s super-giant oilfields in the 1960s,” IEA analysts Alessandro Blasi and Yoko Nobuoka wrote in an analysis.But all of that production still didn’t produce profits. The industry amassed $200 billion in negative cash flow in the 2010-2014 period. That bill had to be paid through higher debt, equity issuance and asset sales.(Click to enlarge)The 2014 market downturn forced a bunch of companies operating on the edge out of business. Nearly 100 shale companies filed for bankruptcy in 2015 and 2016.The downturn forced a rethink, and after years of cost-cutting and tight-fisted financing, the numbers started to improve. Total investment in shale fell by 70 percent between 2014 and 2016, but notably, production didn’t see a corresponding meltdown, more of a correction. Production began to rise again as drillers learned to do more with less.Related: The Most Important Waterway In The Oil WorldAs oil prices stabilized and edged back up, investment began flooding back, rising by 60 percent in 2017. Still, profits remained elusive. “Asset sales once again became the main source of financing operations,” the IEA said.Permian production skyrocketed and drillers began throwing rigs back into operation. But several years on from the beginning of the downturn, investors demanded a change in strategy, with an emphasis on cash flow, returns, dividends, share buybacks and capital discipline. Shareholders pressed drillers to abandon the growth model and sought changes to executive compensation to downgrade the rewards for production growth.The spike in oil prices this year is a huge gift to the industry. With breakeven prices on shale wells much lower, the surge in prices could push companies into profitable territory. “Since its inception, the industry has been characterised by negative free cash flow as expectations of rising production and cost improvements led to continuous overspending in the sector,” the IEA said. “Over the last few months, the industry as a whole has seen a notable improvement in financial conditions, though the picture varies markedly by company, and the overall health of the industry remains fragile.”The conditions are lining up in a favorable way for the shale industry. Production is rising, prices are up, and so far cost inflation has not eaten away too much at the efficiency gains. Also, the industry is much more consolidated than it was in the past, which brings economies of scale. Improvements in drilling technology and the spread of digitalization is also yielding benefits. “[W]e estimate that the shale sector as a whole is on track to achieve, for the first time in its history, positive free cash flow in 2018.”Related: Is This The Next Coal Megaproject?There are risks to this forecast. The pipeline constraints in the Permian will force a slowdown in production over the next year. More painfully, Permian-focused companies that have not locked up hedges for their output, or have not secured available space on the region’s pipelines, could suffer from steep discounts – often in excess of $10 per barrel – for their crude. Other bottlenecks for natural gas takeaway capacity as well as for wastewater, could also drag on Permian producers.The IEA also said there are “clear signs of overheating” in the Permian, which is stretching available labor, materials and equipment. There is uncertainty about whether further productivity advancements can offset these inflationary challenges.Then, obviously, there is the risk of a slump in crude oil prices or, more broadly, an economic downturn that drags down the entire sector.But some of those problems only hit specific companies. The conditions for the entire industry, by and large, are better than at any point in shale recent history. For now, the U.S. shale industry seems poised to finally post positive cash flow.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Profitability-Is-Finally-Within-Reach-For-US-Shale.html,"Jul 27, 2018 at 15:33 | Nick Cunningham","Jul 27, 2018",Profitability Is Finally Within Reach For U.S. Shale
2018-07-27,"The prices of crude oil and natural gas liquids are much higher than they were a year ago and the outlook for natural gas prices has improved. However, dozens of profitable upstream oil & gas companies are still trading in the lower half of their 52-week range. The money managers on Wall Street either don’t understand how profitable upstream companies are at these commodity prices or they believe oil prices have peaked and are going to fall.First let me say that most investors, let’s call them the “Wall Street Gang”, really don’t understand the upstream oil & gas sub-sector. These are the companies that drill, complete and operate oil & gas wells, which provide the primary energy sources that give us such a high standard of living in the United States. Most investors don’t realize how profitable the business will be if crude oil prices just stay over $65/bbl; not to mention the wealth that will be created if oil bounces back to over $100/bbl.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();On July 25th I made a presentation in Houston to a room full of energy sector investors were I gave my thoughts on a recent Raymond James & Associates industry update and their oil price target. Raymond James Energy Team, based in Houston, is now forecasting that West Texas Intermediate (WTI) will average $70/bbl during the 2nd half of 2018 and the beginning of 2019. Their “official” long-range price forecast for oil prices are $65/bbl for WTI and $70/bbl for Brent after 2019. “Unofficially”, most of the analysts based in Houston that I talk to think oil prices are going a lot higher.My opinions are that:The price of oil never stays at the “Right Price” for long. Oil price cycles always over-shoot on the downside and the upside, so there is a good chance we see WTI prices spike over $100/bbl within the next twelve months. If you agree with me, then you should have a lot of high quality oil & gas company stocks in your portfolio.Oil Supply/DemandCommodity prices should be set by supply/demand fundamentals, so let’s check that out first. Then I will go over some of the “FEARS” that seem to be keeping the Wall Street money managers on the sidelines.  Related: Oil Jobs Under Threat From DronesDemand for oil is increasing about 1.5 million barrels per day each year and non-U.S. / non-OPEC production is declining by approximately 0.5 million barrels per day. This paints a bullish outlook for the energy sector companies that work in the upstream, midstream and oilfield services sectors.(Click to enlarge)Looking only at the fundamentals, 2018 should be a very good year for the Energy Sector:What are investors afraid of? Why hasn’t more money rotated into the Energy Sector?FEAR and GREED drive the marketsThere are four “Primary Fears” that are keeping money managers on the sidelines:On top of these are company specific fears that are beyond the scope of this article.Let’s cover each of these “Primary Fears” one at a time.Worry #1: U.S. Supply Growth Will Overwhelm the Oil MarketIt is true that oil production is growing in the United States, but the rate of growth will slow after 2018. Without a significant increase in the active drilling rig count, there is no way the U.S. (still a net importer of more than 6 million barrels of oil per day) can meet global demand for oil on its own. Outside of the U.S. all of the other countries net to declining oil supply and this assumes only modest declines in Venezuela and Iran in 2019.Within OPEC, only Saudi Arabia has significant untapped production capacity and it does not appear that they can offset the declines in Venezuela, Libya, Angola and Iran following the implementation of U.S. sanctions in November.The U.S. cannot keep growing oil production at the current pace (or even close to it) unless there is a significant rise in the active rig count year-after-year. During a July 16, 2018 presentation in Houston, Raymond James estimated that the active onshore drilling rig count in the U.S. would need to increase by more than 200 next year in order for the U.S. to duplicate the 2018 production growth in 2019. I don’t think it is possible because the onshore drilling companies don’t have a lot more high end drilling rigs sitting around and they won’t build them without long-term contracts.The U.S. active rig count must grow each year because the nation’s annual depletion rate is increasing as we layer on more and more high decline rate horizontal wells. Today, the high end rigs don’t exist to do the job.I believe that 2018 will be the PEAK year of oil production growth in the U.S.Horizontal well productivity gains (over 30% per year from 2011 to 2015) slowed to 11% in 2017 and are expected to decline to 8% in 2018 and 5% in 2019. Reasons for the slowdown are:Worry #2: The OPEC+ Coalition will Flood the Oil Market Again 1. It is clearly not in the cartel’s or Russia’s best interest to lower oil prices again 2. OPEC’s additional production capacity nets to zero through 2020(Click to enlarge)Saudi Arabia: The Kingdom’s claim that they have remaining production capacity of 2 million barrels per day is a myth. It would take an aggressive drilling program and lots of new infrastructure to push their production up to 12 million barrels per day. Raymond James’ (RJ) base model for 2018 to 2020 global oil supply & demand is that Saudi Arabia’s actual production will average 10.3 million barrels per day thru 2020. Saudi’s recent increases in exports are the result of draining storage tanks and cannot be sustained for long.Venezuela is a “Failed State”: RJ’s base assumption is that Venezuela’s production goes from ~1.3 MMBOPD in Q2 2018 to ~0.9 MMBOPD in Q4 2019. I’ve had some smart people tell me that Venezuela’s production could go to zero if there is a military coup and the chances of that happening goes up each day. PDVSA, the government’s oil company, recently announced that two of their four oil upgraders had to be shut down for maintenance. This will take several 100,000 barrels per day off of the market.Libya is another wildcard. RJs base assumption is that Libyan production holds at ~1.0 MMBOPD. My view of Libya is that it is a failed state much like Venezuela. It is a country run by lawless gangs. As we have seen several times over the years since Moammar Kaddafi was killed in 2011, a significant amount of Libyan oil production can be taken off the market without notice. Anyone counting on a steady flow of oil from Libya has not been paying much attention to the news from North Africa.Iran: RJ’s base assumption is that President Trump’s sanctions against Iran will take ~210,000 BOPD off the market. Obviously, this is a wildcard and the actual amount could be a lot higher. My opinion is that Trump is serious about Iran and the U.S. sanctions will take more than 1,000,000 BOPD off the market in early 2019. Direct military conflict between the U.S. and Iran will quickly push oil over a $100/bb.Russia is not a threat to oversupply the oil market that many on Wall Street believe it is. In November, 2016 they “drained the tanks” to artificially jack up production before the Vienna Agreement. Russian growth will be ~125,000 BOPD per year.In Summary: OPEC+ cannot increase production even if they wanted to do so and it is certainly not in their best interest to do anything that will lower oil prices.Worry #3: Lack of Non-U.S. / Non-OPEC Production DeclinesInvestors often forget that outside of the U.S. and OPEC the “Rest of the World” produces more than 40% of global oil supply. Most of the countries don’t produce enough oil to meet their own demand and, like the U.S., they are heavily dependent on imported oil and refined products.Lack of investment in large exploration & development projects since early 2014 has pushed completion dates of many Non-U.S. supply growth projects many years down the line. Some projects have been cancelled. Outside of small growth in Brazil and Russia, the rest of the world’s oil production will be on decline through 2022 and there is not much chance of anything changing this outlook. Also, even when there was over four years (2010-2014) of $100/Bbl oil, there were no major oil discoveries added. Outside of the U.S. “Shale Revolution”, the rest of the world reached “Peak Oil” in 2010 just as King Hubbert predicted that it would.Worry #4: Weakening Global Demand for OilThe concept of “Peak Demand” for oil is total hogwash ginned up by the same people that think Tesla will take over the automobile market. Annual demand for oil has actually accelerated this decade. Demand for coal has declined, but demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs goes up year-after-year. Related: Tight Oil Markets Are Ignoring Supply Risk“Demand for oil got off to a strong start this year with global 1Q18 growth at over 2 million barrels per day (YOY), helped by cold weather in the northern hemisphere. Recent data, however, points to a slowdown, with rising prices a factor. In 2Q18, growth slowed to 900,000 b/d (YOY). In 1H18, growth will average 1.5 million b/d, falling to 1.3 million b/d in the second half of the year. In 1H2019, the comparison with a strong 1H2018 will see growth of close to 1.2 million b/d, accelerating to 1.6 million b/d in 2H2019. We expect growth of 1.4 million b/d in world oil demand in both 2018 and 2019, unchanged from last month's Oil Market Report.” - International Energy Agency 7-12-2018.The IEA has a long history of understating oil demand growth. From 2009 to 2015 IEA understated demand growth each year and had to revise up their demand “forecasts” upwards to actuals by an average of 490,000 BOPD. My forecast of actual demand growth being 1.5 million barrels per day year-over-year in 2018, 2019 and 2020 may end up being too conservative. With a strong global economy, demand for oil will probably increase closer to 2.0 MMBOPD in 2018.This world runs on oil and nothing on the horizon is going to change that:(Click to enlarge)Conclusion: Global demand for oil exceeds supply by more than a million barrels per day as you read this article. U.S. and OECD crude oil inventories will be declining to dangerous levels within six months and the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is expected to average more than $70/bbl for at least the next three quarter. Chances are that conditions in Venezuela and the impact of U.S. sanctions against Iran will take another million barrels of oil supply off the market.My Prediction: Oil price cycles always overshoot the “Right Price” and we will see $100/Bbl oil in early 2019.Now is a great time to add more energy to your investment portfolio.By Dan SteffensMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Whats-Keeping-Investors-Away-From-Energy-Stocks.html,"Jul 27, 2018 at 15:32 | Dan Steffens","Jul 27, 2018",What’s Keeping Investors Away From Energy Stocks?
2018-07-27,"In the previous article, Asia’s Insatiable Oil Demand, I covered global and regional oil consumption numbers according to the recently-released 2018 BP Statistical Review of World Energy.To recap, global oil consumption rose to a new record high in 2018 and has now increased in 31 of the past 34 years. Over the past decade, global oil consumption has increased by 11.1 million barrels per day (BPD). The primary driver behind the past decade’s demand jump is the Asia Pacific region, which was the source of 77 percent of the world’s demand growth over that time.Today, I want to discuss the source of the world’s new oil production in recent years.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();A decade ago, in the summer of 2008, the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was racing toward $150 a barrel. Over the previous three years, the world had only increased oil production by 1.2 million BPD, and it essentially all came from OPEC.Many analysts, including me, were extremely concerned about the future hold OPEC would maintain over the world’s oil supplies. It appeared that there would an enormous transfer of wealth from those countries dependent upon oil imports — like the United States — to OPEC countries. In many cases, these countries have interests that are hostile to those of the U.S., so this was very much an issue of national security.But the future played out differently than it seemed it would in the summer of 2008. Unbeknownst to most people, oil producers were experimenting with a marriage between two established oil drilling technologies — horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing.The success of this marriage would unlock oil in tight oil and shale oil deposits that had previously been too expensive to recover, and would result in one of the greatest oil booms the world had ever seen. In fact, the “fracking revolution” caused U.S. oil production to turn upward in 2009, and then rise over the next seven years at the fastest rate in U.S. history.While it is still true that OPEC produced 42.6 percent of the world’s oil in 2017, the majority of new oil production since 2008 has come from the U.S.Oil Supply Growth 2008-2017Of the 10.3 million BPD of new oil production since 2008, the U.S. supplied 6.2 million BPD (60 percent). The world’s two other major oil-producing countries, Saudi Arabia and Russia, saw their production increase by 1.7 million BPD and 1.2 million BPD respectively since 2008.OPEC overall increased its production by 3.6 million BPD since 2008, primarily as a result of production growth in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Iran. But OPEC’s gains were limited by production declines in Venezuela, Libya, and Nigeria. There were also regional production declines in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South and Central America.  Related: Oil Prices Slip As Rig Count Inches HigherAlso notable is that Canada and Mexico are major oil producers (although Mexico’s production has been declining). Overall, North America supplied 20 million BPD of the world’s oil in 2017 (22 percent). This was ahead of every other region of the world except for the Middle East, which produced 31.6 million BPD, or 34.1 percent of the world’s total.According to the BP Statistical Review, the U.S. now leads both Saudi Arabia and Russia in crude oil production. This is in part because BP’s definition of “oil” includes natural gas liquids (NGLs), which grew by about two million BPD in the U.S. as natural gas production boomed. Without the NGLs, the U.S. would probably have been behind Saudi Arabia, but probably not Russia, in total oil production.It is hard to overstate the consequences of the fracking revolution, because the U.S. oil production surge broke OPEC’s stranglehold on global oil prices. But U.S. tight oil production will inevitably slow and once again begin to decline. The key questions are how soon this will happen, and whether a return to >$100/bbl oil — and in turn OPEC’s stranglehold — awaits that inevitability.By Robert RapierMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/How-US-Shale-Flipped-The-Script-In-Global-Oil-Markets.html,"Jul 27, 2018 at 15:32 | Robert Rapier","Jul 27, 2018",How U.S. Shale Flipped The Script In Global Oil Markets
