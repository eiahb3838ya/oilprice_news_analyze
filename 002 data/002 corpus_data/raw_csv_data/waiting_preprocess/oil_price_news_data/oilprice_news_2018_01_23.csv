2018-01-23,"U.S. shale companies are expected to ramp up production this year, and higher oil prices could lead to the industry turning profits for the first time.For years, the shale promise has been hollow. Even when oil prices were trading above $100 per barrel, most shale drillers weren’t profitable. They drilled rapidly, brought huge volumes of production online in short order, and upended the global oil market. Any cash they recouped they ploughed back into the ground. The debt taken on to drill new wells was made on the assumption that future growth would translate into bigger earnings, and like any industry growing quickly, Wall Street was quick to pour money into evermore drilling.But spending has vastly outpaced earnings. According to The Wall Street Journal, the shale industry has spent $265 billion more than it has generated since 2010.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();The collapse of oil prices forced a deep contraction, with lots of write-downs, defaults, layoffs and bankruptcies. There was a period of time when Wall Street was lured back in on the promise of lower breakeven costs and substantial efficiency gains.But profits still proved to be elusive. Only last year did major investors start demanding big changes. That led to shale executives committing to a more prudent and investor-centered strategy, which called for more conservative drilling programs and an emphasis on cash and profits over growth.With oil prices suddenly and unexpectedly higher compared to just a few months ago, the shale industry could quite possibly have its cake and eat it too. The WSJ notes that the industry has all the ingredients it needs for 2018 to be a profitable one, a first for the industry. That could occur simultaneously with enormous volumes of fresh supply.

An analysis by Jeffries finds that a group of 20 small shale companies are planning on increasing spending this year by a modest 8 percent, a sign of restraint after hiking spending by 55 percent last year.Meanwhile, oil prices are sharply higher right now than they were last year, granting an unexpected windfall to the industry. On top of that, a lot of drillers are sitting on drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs), which basically means that some of the costs have already been accounted for. If some of those wells are completed this year, it will lead to a rush of new supply without a huge spending increase. The DUC list nearly hit 7,500 in December, up more than 30 percent from the start of 2017.It isn’t all smooth sailing, however, particularly if “explosive” shale growth undercuts prices. But 2018 is shaping up to be the brightest year yet for U.S. shale. “There is always a risk that they will shoot themselves in the foot again,” John Castellano, managing director in the energy practice of consulting firm AlixPartners, told the WSJ. But, unlike in the past, this time around “the companies have much lower costs, better balance sheets, better management teams and more room to move.”The EIA expects the U.S. to top 10 million barrels per day (mb/d) for the first time ever next month, with production averaging 10.3 mb/d for 2018. Output will then surge above 11 mb/d by the end of 2019, the agency predicts.  Related: $70 Oil Cripples European RefinersFrom there, things could get tricky. Argus Media reports that the Permian — where much of the shale growth will be concentrated — could face pipeline bottlenecks at some point in late 2019 or 2020. While there is ample room right now, producers are “going to run into another wall for infrastructure capacity,” Robert Barnes, the head of commercial crude for Magellan, said at the Argus Americas Crude Summit in Houston. That sentiment was echoed by Brent Secrest of Enterprise Product Partners, who said that at some point, there is “going to be a day of reckoning.”But for the next few quarters at least, shale companies could enjoy some of their best numbers ever. And because share prices performed so poorly last year, and still lag the broader increase in crude prices, analysts see huge potential for energy stocks.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Biggest-Year-Yet-For-US-Shale.html,"Jan 23, 2018 at 16:35 | Nick Cunningham","Jan 23, 2018",The Biggest Year Yet For U.S. Shale
2018-01-23,"Cash-strapped and crisis-stricken Venezuela “can easily manage” an oil production increase of 1 million bpd this year to lift its production capacity to 2.472 million bpd, its oil minister Manuel Quevedo told S&P Global Platts in an interview published on Tuesday.Cash shortages amid a severe economic crisis have led to Venezuela’s oil production steadily dropping over the past few months, to a nearly-three-decade low last month.Last week, figures by OPEC showed that Venezuela’s oil production declined by another 82,000 bpd in December to 1.745 million bpd. The Venezuelan government’s self-reported figures showed that production plunged by a massive 216,000 bpd in December, to 1.621 million bpd. The country sitting on the world’s largest oil reserves saw its crude oil production drop by 649,000 bpd in 2017—a 29-percent annual plunge—and probably the worst loss of oil production in a single year in recent history.Quevedo—a National Guard major general who was recently appointed by Nicolas Maduro as the new head of state oil firm PDVSA and the oil ministry—expressed optimism when speaking to S&P Global Platts. Quevedo said that Venezuela could achieve the presidential order to boost its oil production by 1 million bpd this year, by restructuring its debts to Russia and China, attracting international investment to redevelop its shut oil fields, and incentivizing its joint venture partners to boost production at existing projects.The minister said there had been recent talks with oil supermajors Shell and Total, which have minority stakes in joint ventures in Venezuela.  While Quevedo told S&P Global Platts “We could easily start to recover very soon”, analysts are predicting even steeper declines for Venezuela’s oil production this year.

2018-01-23,"Four major airlines have said they have no plans to hedge fuel deliveries despite higher oil prices. These include Delta, American, United, and Dubai’s Emirates. This may suggest the airlines do not believe the current price increase will be a resilient, long-term one. On the other hand, for at least one of the airlines, it’s just how they do business.“We have not hedged since the merger and our philosophy has not changed. We are the largest purchaser of jet fuel and we think we would be bidding against ourselves. The market is quite thin beyond 12 months,” said American Airlines’ managing director and assistant treasurer, Amelia Anderson, speaking at a panel during the Airline Economics conference in Dublin.AirAsia’s CEO Tony Fernandes shares the sentiment. In a Bloomberg interview he said that after airlines have had to deal with WTI at over US$100 a barrel, WTI at US$66 is “still a honeymoon period.” Fernandes added that the airline is not worried about the future price developments because of the strong U.S. shale production, the oil demand outlook, and the gas demand outlook.The comments of the airline executives come on the heels of IMF’s latest world economic outlook, which forecast the world’s economy will grow by 3.9 percent, a 0.2-percentage-point upward revision.  Related: Saudis Unmoved By Oil Price SurgeA growing global economy will certainly mean greater demand for oil, which would support higher prices. In fact, Bloomberg’s oil strategist Julian Lee says, quoting Energy Aspects analysts, that we could next year see Brent at US$100 a barrel, albeit briefly, if new production outside of the United States declines, what with the ongoing production cuts across OPEC and Russia.The energy consultancy is much more bullish than others about oil demand; it sees it growing by 1.7 to 2 million bpd in 2019, which is in tune with IMF’s economic outlook. Yet this rosy outlook might fail to materialize precisely because of prices: the higher they are, the less firm the demand growth will be. In this context, it would make sense for airlines to not rush to hedge fuel purchases.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Largest-Oil-Consumers-Not-In-A-Rush-To-Hedge-Crude.html,"Jan 23, 2018 at 10:53 | Irina Slav","Jan 23, 2018",Largest Oil Consumers Not In A Rush To Hedge Crude
