2018-02-23,"Within a few months, Mexico will have a new President. With the incumbent Enrique Peña Nieto barred from running, the most likely winner is Andrés Manuel López Obrador, leading his newly created National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) to a long-sought victory. Obrador, or AMLO as he is most often abbreviated, started his career in the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) which dominated Mexico’s 20th century politics and continues to be a leading force in the 21st, became the leading voice against the PRI and after two unsuccessful attempts he is on the brink of a breakthrough. This is especially pertinent in view of Mexico’s opening up of its upstream sector to foreign investment which AMLO has promised to wind back. But just how far can he go?To put the stakes in perspective, one has to look at the history of Mexico’s oil industry. Following a 1938 nationalization of the entire industry, for 76 years only the Mexican national oil company PEMEX had rights to develop fields both onshore and offshore. Ironically, the same party (PRI) which initiated the nationalization in the past has pulled the plug on it in 2014 – cognizant that Mexico had significant reserves which were not utilized due to PEMEX’s inability to cover all projects duly at the same time. The Peña Nieto Administration has also made PEMEX more autonomous in that it has done away with the burdensome government approval mechanisms. Notwithstanding the success of the oil reform, the PRI stands to lose.The reasons for a potential failure of Peña Nieto’s successor (José Antonio Meade Kuribreña, former Secretary of Finance and Public Credit) are manifold. Although the economy grew by an annual 2-2.5 percent throughout Peña Nieto’s tenure, its USD-denominated GDP fell by 20 percent. Corruption remains rampant in Mexico – in fact it had permeated the political classes to such an extent that 8 former PRI governors have been arrested or investigated on charges of corruption under the incumbent President’s watch. The taint reached the President, too, having had to apologize for his wife buying a house from a government contractor, Grupo Higa. Moreover, a plethora of smear campaigns have backfired for the ruling PRI – warnings that AMLO might turn Mexico into another Venezuela fell flat against the background of spiraling crime rates (more than 29 000 murders in 2017).Related: Why Is The WTI-Brent Spread Shrinking?Obrador has worked hard to make sure his bid is successful the third time, he toured every single municipality of Mexico ahead of the 2018 ballot. AMLO has been a vocal opponent of the state of things in Mexico’s oil sector, he rose to national prominence as the defender of Mexico’s indigenous people vis-à-vis PEMEX-caused pollution. Upon the Peña Nieto Administration announcing the opening up of Mexico’s upstream, AMLO promised widespread protests but a sudden heart attack prevented him from staging anything. Yet he never renounced the idea, pledging to roll back the energy reform, however, with time, his stance became more subdued – he ruled out authoritarian action on the issue and promised to hold a referendum to see the vox populi.Why should it matter anyway, one might ask. Well, because Mexico’s shelf remains one of the few remaining oil-producing provinces still capable of unearthing massive discoveries. The Mexican and US Gulf deepwater has been one of the rare solid performers in terms of new finds, albeit with different quality parameters – the likes of the deepwater light 42° API Maximino (recoverable reserves of 146 million barrels and 314 BCf of natural gas) and Nobilis (110 mln. barrels and 179 BCf) or the shallower heavy 11° API Ayatsil-Tekel (453 million barrels and 40 BCf) or the 10° API Utsil field (104.1 million barrels and 12 BCf of gas) all make part of the last 10 years’ discovery list. In order to succeed in developing these fields in a timely manner, PEMEX has expressed its willingness to farm out these fields.Thus, Mexican authorities try to push the energy reforms through before the new presumed Administration of AMLO takes over. After Mexico organized for PEMEX Round Zero, whereby the national company could bid for most of the nation’s proven reserves, it held Round 1, then Round 2.1 (shallow water acreages), as well as 2.2 and 2.3 (onshore blocks) in 2017. The auctioning did not end there, this year Mexico already held its first deepwater acreage auction, Round 2.4, but also intends to hold Rounds 3.1 and 3.2 in March and July, distributing remaining shallow water and onshore blocks, correspondingly. Apart from maximizing the effects of crude oil auctions and streamlining farm-out procedures, the Peña Nieto government also wants to liberalize the domestic jet market and have power supply auctions, too, before it is forced to leave office.  Related: What’s Really Happening With Venezuela’s “El Petro?”The latest auction, Round 2.4 exceeded the expectations of oil market observers, in that 19 out of the 29 deepwater blocks offered were awarded amongst high competition (the Government expected that only seven will be distributed). This would translate into roughly $90 billion in investments over the lifetime of the contracts – no wonder this auction was deemed the most important, incorporating acreages from the deepwater Perdido Basin, the Mexican Ridges, as well as from Campeche/Salina. Royal Dutch Shell was particularly aggressive in its bidding, taking up 9 out of the 19 blocks, followed by Petronas (6 blocks) and Qatar Petroleum (5). To further emphasize the bids’ importance, it should be noted that the total production capacity of the blocks auctioned in Round 2.4 is almost equivalent to the amount of oil Mexico produces currently – 1.9 million barrels per day.The Peña Nieto Administration will push ahead with the two remaining auctions this year, which will most likely result in similarly high interest from international majors. The reason is simple – apart from genuine reserves in place, Mexico is offering competitive E&P terms which are bound to worsen as a more statist leader is expected to take the helm. It is unlikely that López Obrador will continue with acreage auctions, therefore it would be politic to invest now for those who are interested. Disentangling the changes would become a slow and increasingly painful process for AMLO, for he needs to amend the Constitution to reverse the changes – a Sisyphean task. Deepwater, despite higher complexity and bigger costs, is a more sensible investment target as the development of onshore fields would be fraught with many unnecessary roadblocks – siphoning, blackmail and murder are just a few of the regular phenomena occurring.By Viktor Katona for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Should-Energy-Investors-Fear-Mexicos-2018-Elections.html,"Feb 23, 2018 at 16:50 | Viktor Katona","Feb 23, 2018",Should Energy Investors Fear Mexico’s 2018 Elections?
2018-02-23,"U.S. shale production growth has outperformed even the most bullish forecasts, forcing OPEC and the International Energy Agency (IEA) to revise up American supply growth projections month after month.The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) also expects shale/tight oil to continue to grow in all possible modeled scenarios for the next four years, according to its Annual Energy Outlook 2018 published this month.While the EIA is not predicting what will happen, it is modeling possible production scenarios under certain assumptions. Under one of those modeled projections—the Low Oil and Gas Resource and Technology case—the assumptions applied are lower resources and higher costs. In this model, U.S. tight oil production—including the plays Bakken/Three Forks/Sanish, Eagle Ford, Woodford, Austin Chalk, Spraberry, Niobrara, Avalon/Bone Springs, and Monterey—is expected to rise from 4.96 million bpd in 2017 to 5.59 million bpd in 2022, and then to start declining on a steady downward trend by 2050, when tight oil production is expected to be at 4.42 million bpd.This is one of the side cases in EIA’s models, and one of the most unlikely, because it assumes no technological breakthroughs, lower resources, and higher costs. Under this model, total U.S. crude oil production is pegged at 9.14 million bpd this year, while figures are currently available, showing that production is already above 10 million bpd and likely to average more than 10.5 million bpd this year.  The Reference case scenario shows tight oil production jumping to more than 7 million bpd by 2025 and surpassing 8 million bpd in 2036, before starting to level off some time in the early 2040s. Total U.S. crude oil production in the Reference case is between 11 million bpd and 12 million bpd by 2050, “as tight oil development moves into less productive areas and as well productivity declines,” the EIA says.Sure, longer-term projections are much more uncertain than shorter-term forecasts, and U.S. oil production will depend on many factors—oil prices, the pace of technological advances, costs, well productivity, and U.S. and global oil demand growth, to name a few.Related: Tech Giants Scramble To Secure Cobalt SupplyMoreover, the pace of the booming shale production over the next five years will also be determined by several factors that could limit the supply growth potential, which the EIA has not accounted for in its modeling, energy expert Robert Rapier writes on Forbes. These are midstream infrastructure constraints, the flaring of associated natural gas that has limits imposed, cost inflation, and shortage of fracking service providers that could potentially slow down growth over the next few years and could shift the timing of peak tight oil, Rapier argues.Everyone agrees that shale will grow in the near term—even OPEC, which admitted in its World Oil Outlook 2017 that U.S. tight oil will grow at least until 2025 as “drillers seek out and aggressively produce barrels from sweet spots in the Permian and other basins.” OPEC sees U.S. tight oil peaking in the latter half of the 2020s.Still, the shale growth rate will depend on how fast pipeline infrastructure can keep up with increased production.Midstream companies will continue to pour billions of dollars into takeaway capacity infrastructure in the Permian, with each project worth around US$1 billion, for a total of tens of billions of dollars, Aaron Blomquist, managing director, investment banking with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co., told Midland Reporter-Telegram in an interview at the end of 2017.The question is whether the rise in takeaway capacity will catch up with the surge in production.U.S. shale growth will also hinge on how fast labor shortages or shortages of frac sand could be overcome.In addition, growth will depend on whether drillers—who could soon start to test the Permian region’s geological limits—will be able to overcome the geological constraints with tech breakthroughs. If drillers can’t overcome the law of physics with technology, Permian production could peak in 2021, putting more than 1.5 million bpd of future production in question, and potentially significantly influencing oil prices, Wood Mackenzie has warned.Related: Oil Prices Diverge On Mixed DataThe pace of shale growth will also be determined by the shift in investor sentiment toward drillers that gained momentum in the second half of 2017. Oil tycoon Harold Hamm issued a warning that U.S. producers won’t succeed if they “drill themselves into oblivion”. Now there is a shift from ‘grow at all costs’ to ‘make some profits for a change’, and companies are more focused on cash flow generation.“Investors really want companies to generate good economics which, for the most part, means living within your means, spending cash flow or below cash flow and using any free cash flow to do something good for the shareholders, whether it’s pay off debt, buy back shares or even pay a dividend,” Robert Watson, chief executive at San Antonio-based Abraxas Petroleum Corporation, told North American Shale magazine’s Patrick C. Miller earlier this month.There is no doubt that U.S. shale production will grow over the next three to four years. But there are many economic, geological, technological, corporate finance, and infrastructure factors that will set the pace for that growth, both in the short term and in the long run.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Peak-US-Shale-Could-Be-4-Years-Away.html,"Feb 23, 2018 at 16:42 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Feb 23, 2018",Peak U.S. Shale Could Be 4 Years Away
2018-02-23,"Oil production in Southeast Asia and East Asia will decline by 20 percent between 2017 and 2025, according to a new report from Rystad Energy.Natural depletion from mature oil fields will significantly erode oil production in the region, and new projects will not be able to makeup for the decline. Rystad Energy expects total oil production in Southeast Asia and East Asia to decline to 10.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) by 2025, down from 13.1 million boe/d in 2017.Oil production from China, Rystad Energy predicts, will decline by the least, “supported by the stable output from the giant Changqing field and several ramping up projects, including Longmaxi Shale.” The predications show the Changqing field contributing more than 1 million boe/d over the next five years.(Click to enlarge) But production in Southeast Asia doesn’t fare as well, with output dropping sharply. Rystad cited the example of the ExxonMobil led Banyu Urip project in Indonesia and Shell’s deepwater project Gumusut-Kakap in Malaysia, both of which to peak and decline over the forecast period.Underpinning the decline in output from mature fields is the dwindling volume of new oil and gas discovered over the past decade and a half. In fact, since the broader oil market downturn began in 2014, discoveries in East and Southeast Asia have plunged. In 2017, the worst year for discoveries, only about 300 million boe in reserves were discovered, down from over 4 billion boe in 2012 and 6.5 billion boe in 2000. Fewer discoveries will mean fewer and fewer new sources of supply coming online in the years ahead.More importantly, even the limited volume of oil that was discovered recently may not necessarily translate into production. “Most of the recent key discoveries,” Rystad said in its report, “are still unsanctioned.”  Related: The U.S. Oil Industry Sets Its Sights On AsiaEven as China doesn’t suffer as much as some of its regional neighbors, output has still declined quite a bit in recent years. The IEA sees China producing an average of 3.8 million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2018, down by 0.5 mb/d since 2015. Much of China’s output comes from mature oil fields and requires hefty levels of investment to keep output from falling. The market downturn that began in 2014 forced China’s main state-owned oil companies to scale back spending, and ultimately, the companies shelved some production that was no longer profitable.Production from the region has been declining since 2015 and Rystad Energy predicts that the losses will continue for the rest of the decade. “Current discoveries waiting in the pipeline to be developed are not enough to offset the declining trend in the region.”In a global context, Southeast and East Asia amount to a major bullish force on the oil market, not only because supply is falling, but also because demand is soaring. By all accounts, Asia will represent a large slice of future oil demand growth going forward. Just a few days ago, BP published its annual Energy Outlook, in which it predicted that China and India alone would make up half of total global energy demand growth over the next three decades.  Related: What Is The Right Price For Oil In A Balanced Market?That stands in sharp contrast to, say, North America, where supply is growing significantly and demand is expected to be flat at best over the next decade or so.These trends likely mean that the shipment of crude oil that just left the newly revamped Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) and appears to be heading for China, will be increasingly common in the years ahead.The U.S. is retooling other ports, such as the one at Corpus Christi, TX, to also handle very large crude carriers (VLCCs). China emerged as a top buyer of U.S. crude last year, a relationship that should grow going forward. That is especially true since oil production in Asia is declining.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Asia-Set-To-Lose-3-Million-Bpd-Of-Oil-Production.html,"Feb 23, 2018 at 16:41 | Nick Cunningham","Feb 23, 2018",Asia Set To Lose 3 Million Bpd Of Oil Production
2018-02-23,"BP says oil demand will peak in the 2030s, and that EVs will rise 100-fold to capture about a third of the car market.BP released its annual Energy Outlook, with forecasts through 2040. Unlike in years past, this version sees more upheaval on the horizon as the energy landscape evolves rapidly. “Indeed, the continuing rapid growth of renewables is leading to the most diversified fuel mix ever seen,” BP CEO Bob Dudley said in a statement. “Abundant and diversified energy supplies will make for a challenging marketplace. Don’t be fooled by the recent firming in oil prices: the focus on efficiency, reliability and capital discipline is here to stay.”BP believes that just about all of the growth in energy demand will come from fast-growing developing economies, with China and India alone accounting for half of the total growth in global energy demand through 2040.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();BP offered several different forecasts, but all predict a peak in oil demand in the 2030s, with varying degrees of decline thereafter. Its central forecast sees peak oil demand in the mid-2030s at about 110 million barrels per day (mb/d), with consumption plateauing and declining through 2040 and beyond. In other words, demand grows for another two decades, rising by 15 mb/d, before consumption tops out.BP sees the number of EVs on the road surging to 320 million by 2040, capturing about a third of the market in terms of miles traveled. That equates roughly to a 100-fold increase from the 3 million EVs on the road today. It is also sharply up from the 100 million EVs BP expected to be on the road in 2035 in last year’s Energy Outlook.Yet, it doesn’t equate to the total EV revolution that many hope to see. In fact, BP still sees carbon emissions rising by 10 percent through 2040, a scenario incompatible with what scientists say are needed to hit climate targets. And in BP’s most aggressive scenario for EVs in which many more governments follow in the footsteps of France and the UK and put in place a ban on gasoline and diesel vehicles by 2040, BP still only sees EVs eliminating about 10 mb/d worth of demand, which would be about 10 percent of the current market. “It’s a big number,” BP’s chief economist Spencer Dale says, but “even in that scenario, oil demand in 2040 is still higher than it is today.” BP says carbon pricing is needed to drive down emissions.Dale argues that cars will be used more in the future, traveling longer distances, but that autonomous vehicles, electricity and efficiency will offset the increase in oil consumption from more vehicles on the road. “The suggestion that rapid growth in electric cars will cause oil demand to collapse just isn’t supported by the basic numbers — even with really rapid growth,” Dale said, according to the FT.Dale predicts the average EV in the future will be used to travel about two and a half times more than the current internal combustion vehicle. “What we expect to see in the 2030s is a huge growth in shared mobility autonomous cars...Once you don’t have to pay for a driver, the cost of taking one of those share mobility fleets services will fall by about 40 or 50 percent,” Dale told reporters. The upshot is that demand for crude oil used in cars remains largely flat at 18.6 mb/d in 2040, down just a hair from 18.7 mb/d in 2016.Another interesting prediction was the expected impact of regulations on plastics. BP sees taxes and regulations on things like plastic bags will help eat into crude oil demand by about 2 mb/d. Still, petrochemicals grow in importance over time, taking a greater share of the demand pie as EVs keep demand flat in transportation.  Related: Brazil’s Coming Oil Boom Will Weigh On Oil PricesThe opinions of other oil majors vary on this hotly contested subject. Officials from Royal Dutch Shell have said that a peak could come as soon as 2025, whereas ExxonMobil and Chevron see demand rising steadily for the foreseeable future, with no peak in sight.In that sense, there is a bit of difference between the European and American oil majors. Shell, BP and Total have begun stepping up their investments into natural gas, utilities and renewable energy. Royal Dutch Shell recently bought First Utility, a UK-based utility. It also purchased a U.S. solar company last month. Total purchased SunPower years ago and is now looking to building up generating assets in France to rival incumbents. BP recently announced plans to jump back into the solar sector after pulling out years ago.To be sure, these are marginal forays into clean energy; the majors are still overwhelmingly invested in oil and gas, and will continue to be for years. Yet, they mark a small but significant pivot away from oil.“The outlook here shows that the world is going to need all forms of energy,” BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley said at a news conference Tuesday, according to the WSJ. “Gas has to be part of the transition, if not a destination fuel” for lowering carbon emissions.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/BP-Sees-Peak-Oil-Demand-In-2030s.html,"Feb 23, 2018 at 16:16 | Nick Cunningham","Feb 23, 2018",BP Sees Peak Oil Demand In 2030s
2018-02-23,"I was jesting the other day about who would be on guitar in OPEC's supergroup, but it got me thinking about the various global oil producers, and how their traits could be reflective of their musicianship. This is where it led me...If OPEC / NOPEC were a supergroup, Saudi Arabia would have to be the band manager: the leader keeping everyone else in check. The kingdom would also double-up as the tour bus driver, given they are the ones driving the rest of the group.     If Saudi is the manager, Russia must be the lead singer, stepping into the spotlight and up to the mic. Unlike roadies (the minnows of OPEC / NOPEC), everyone listens to the singer. As the chart below illustrates, Russia has been remarkably successful at dialing back its exports, particularly in the second half of last year, with the likes of Rosneft, Lukoil and Gazprom being strong-armed into compliance. Russian crude exports spent 2017 averaging 240,000 bpd below October 2016's reference level, signaling compliance by our calculations.(Click to enlarge)With Russia as our vocalist, Angola and Kuwait would be the rhythm section, a measured and solid basis for the band. Kuwait would be the drummer, upbeat and on point, while Angola would be the bass player, steady and reliable - as has been their compliance.We discussed last month how our ClipperData show that Angola has been in compliance by exporting 37 million fewer barrels last year versus its October 2016 reference level.As the chart below illustrates, the West African nation has continued to keep its leading destination, China, well supplied, delivering 55 percent of its 2017 exports there (servicing its oil-for-debt obligations). The U.S. was the second-leading destination for Angolan crude last year, but a long, long (looooong) way back in second - accounting for less than 8 percent of total deliveries.    Back to our supergroup, we still need someone on the axe. Libya is perhaps the best fit for lead guitar, given the ability of its choppy exports to rise and fall like Eric Clapton shredding a fretboard.  Related: What’s Really Happening With Venezuela’s “El Petro?”After averaging just 13,000 bpd in 2016, exports of El Sharara and Es Sider ramped up emphatically in 2017, averaging a whopping 250,000 bpd.The El Sharara field, Libya's largest, was closed in November 2014, before ramping back up again in late 2016. Flows of Es Sider were briefly taken offline in late December amid the Waha pipeline explosion, but as the chart below illustrates, exports from the Es Sider terminal rebounded soon enough as the pipeline was quickly repaired. Exports of both Es Sider and El Sharara have started 2018 by riffing higher, averaging over 450,000 bpd in January, accounting for over a half of total crude exports. As domestic production rises, total Libyan exports are now up to their highest level since mid-2013. Rock 'n Roll.   By Matt SmithMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/OPEC-Supergroup-Keeps-Oil-Exports-Subdued.html,"Feb 23, 2018 at 13:59 | Matt Smith","Feb 23, 2018",OPEC ‘Supergroup’ Keeps Oil Exports Subdued
