2018-03-29,"Remember the wave of bankruptcies that hit shale E&Ps and oilfield services providers in the shale patch between 2015 and 2017? Over those two years, more than 120 oil and gas producers filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States, figures from Haynes & Boone showed last year.Since then, it seems that life has not been much different for many of these post-bankruptcy survivors.Bloomberg’s Alex Nissbaum, in a recent story on the fate of those less fortunate drillers, noted SandRidge Energy as “the poster boy” for post-bankruptcy oil and gas companies that are still struggling to get back on their feet but may never succeed.SandRidge exited bankruptcy last year but has found it difficult to return to growth mode for a number of reasons that are indicative of the challenges that remain in the U.S. shale oil and gas industry.The most obvious one is that not all shale is created equal, whatever the industry tells us about lowering production costs and improving operational efficiencies.Let’s forget this mantra for a moment. Everyone wants in on the Permian boom but not everybody wants in on certain parts of Oklahoma, for instance.As one analyst told Nissbaum about the post-bankruptcy survivors, “The bottom line is a lot of these companies didn’t have very good assets to begin with. You can go through bankruptcy and wipe away debt and that’s all well and good, but the assets they ended up with are still not very attractive.""  Related: US Oil Rig Count Dips As Prices RiseThe truth about how not all shale is created equal often gets ignored in the flood of upbeat news about well productivity and reserves. But some have been warning about this, including Art Berman and EOG’s Mark Papa. Not all shale plays are equally easy to exploit. Not all acreage within the same play is equally cheap to drill. And ultimately, you shouldn’t believe everything you hear from the oil industry.The inherent “inequality” in acreage quality is just one of the industry challenges experienced by the struggle that companies recently emerging from bankruptcy.Another is specific to them and it has to do with shareholders. The majority of these post-bankruptcy companies are now controlled by creditors-turned-shareholders who don’t have the industry background and the dedication it takes to make an oil and gas company successful, says Nissbaum, quoting a Haynes & Boone attorney.These creditors-turned-shareholders are not interested in the long-term sustainability of the business. They want to get their money back and this prompts decisions that are not necessarily the best for the company.That’s not to say that the bigger, healthier oil players in the shale patch are having a good time with their shareholders. Not at all – they are demanding, finally, some solid returns on their investment. Still, that’s better than having to deal with hedge funds and distressed debt buyers who want their money back now.  Related: Oil Majors Should Invest In Deepwater DrillingFinally, there is the possibility that these companies exited bankruptcy too early.Everyone was grasping for straws after the oil price collapse and at the first sign of improving prices, after OPEC+ struck its deal to start curbing production, the shale industry started pumping again, buying into bullish oil price forecasts and demand projections.The thing is, according to analysts at least, many of those eager to exit bankruptcy did not have the necessary liquidity to see the end of the crisis through and they didn’t plan ahead.The question remains, however, if the rest of the pack--those who didn’t have to file for bankruptcy protection--did plan sufficiently ahead to ensure their long-term sustainability. Or did they simply follow their instinct telling them higher prices = more drilling?By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Read From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Struggle-Continues-For-Bankrupt-Shale-Drillers.html,"Mar 29, 2018 at 17:46 | Irina Slav","Mar 29, 2018",The Struggle Continues For Bankrupt Shale Drillers
2018-03-29,"Capital expenditure on upcoming oil and gas fields worldwide will amount to US$811 billion on 615 projects planned between 2018 and 2025, data and analytics company GlobalData says.In upcoming oil fields, over the next eight years, capex in conventional oil projects will be US$352 billion, spending on heavy oil will hit US$44 billion, investment in oil sands is expected at US$43.4 billion, and capex on unconventional oil projects would be US$30 billion.In gas field investment, conventional projects will take US$363.2 billion, while spending on coal bed methane (CBM) and unconventional gas projects are expected at US$3.7 billion and US$1.6 billion, respectively, according to GlobalData.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();The top three countries in terms of capex in upcoming oil and gas fields through 2025 will be Brazil, the United States, and Russia.Brazil will lead the global spending with US$76.7 billion or over 9.5 percent of the total. The country has 49 announced and planned fields. The top fields in terms of capex are three ultra-deepwater conventional oil fields--Lula Central with US$13.3 billion; Lula Oeste with US$6.5 billion; and Buzios V (Franco) with US$5.6 billion.The U.S. ranks second, with investment expected at US$75 billion or a 9.3-percent share of total global capex through 2025.

These are ultra-deepwater Mad Dog Phase 2 with US$13.4 billion, shallow-water Smith Bay with US$11.1 billion, and onshore Horseshoe with US$6.5 billion.Third in global capex comes Russia with US$72.6 billion or some 9 percent of the worldwide spending. Russia has 49 planned and announced fields, and unlike the two leaders, its top three fields for investment are gas projects—the Sakhalin 3 (Kirinskoye South (Yuzhno-Kirinskoye)) shallow water conventional gas field, Kovyktinskoye conventional gas onshore project, and Chayandinskoye conventional gas onshore project.The top ten countries in terms of oil and gas spending also include—in descending order— Mozambique, Nigeria, Australia, Canada, Norway, Indonesia, and the UK. Projects in those countries together are expected to account for US$298 billion, or about 37 percent, of all spending until 2025.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/New-Oilfield-Capex-To-Surpass-800-Billion-By-2025.html,"Mar 29, 2018 at 14:05 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Mar 29, 2018",New Oilfield Capex To Surpass $800 Billion By 2025
2018-03-29,"In 2006, following 35 years of declining U.S. oil production, net monthly imports of crude oil and finished products had climbed to more than 13 million barrels per day (BPD).What’s happened since is nothing short of amazing. Last week, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that U.S. crude oil production had reached 10.38 million BPD.This represents an increase of more than 1.2 million BPD in the past year and is more than 5 million BPD higher than March 2006 production levels.U.S. crude oil demand has fluctuated a bit in recent years but presently stands at just over 20 million BPD, which is about the same level as in 2006.Given the 10 million BPD difference between U.S. oil demand and U.S. oil production, one might think that the U.S. is still dependent on foreign countries for 50% of our crude oil. But it’s more complicated than that.U.S. refineries have invested billions of dollars into equipment to process heavy, sour (i.e., contains sulfur compounds) crudes. Most of the new oil production in the U.S. is light and sweet, which isn’t as economically attractive for refiners who have invested in equipment to process the lower grades (which are much cheaper).Related: The Truth Behind Oil’s Recent Price SpikeThus, U.S. oil producers have been exporting an increasing amount of oil, while U.S. refiners import the cheaper heavy grades. In just the past four years, U.S. crude oil exports have jumped from nearly nothing to more than 1.5 million BPD:(Click to enlarge)U.S. crude oil exports.But the U.S. also exports finished products like gasoline and diesel. In fact, a growing fraction of the oil being consumed in the U.S. is simply being refined and exported. In 2011, the U.S. became a net exporter of finished products (e.g., diesel, gasoline, etc.) for the first time since 1949. Finished product exports have continued to grow since:  Related: $9.5B Deal Creates Biggest Player In The Permian(Click to enlarge)Net finished petroleum product exports.Note that this graphic reflects the difference between the finished products we import and those we export.When all the factors are considered, the impact of growing U.S. oil production becomes clear. The overall balance between U.S. imports and exports of both crude oil and finished products fell to 2.6 million BPD in December. That is the lowest level since the EIA began tracking this category in 1973:(Click to enlarge)Net imports of petroleum and petroleum products.Last fall the International Energy Agency declared in its World Energy Outlook 2017 that the U.S. could be a net exporter of oil within a decade. On the current trajectory, net imports could indeed turn into net exports in 2020.Incidentally, 2020 is also the last year that the IEA projects that supply growth will keep up with demand growth — given the present level of global investments. I will address that possibility in the next column.By Robert RapierMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Petroleum-Imports-Could-Fall-To-Zero-In-2020.html,"Mar 29, 2018 at 10:43 | Robert Rapier","Mar 29, 2018",U.S. Petroleum Imports Could Fall To Zero In 2020
