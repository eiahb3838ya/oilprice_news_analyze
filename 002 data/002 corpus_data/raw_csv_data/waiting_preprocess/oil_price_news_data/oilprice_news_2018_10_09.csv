2018-10-09,"U.S. crude oil exports could increase to 3.9 million bpd by 2020, mostly driven by rising production in the Permian, the Houston Chronicle reported on Tuesday, citing a new report by S&P Global Platts.U.S. crude oil exports are expected to reach 2.2 million bpd next year, according to the estimates.The current ship-borne capacity of the United States is some 4.8 million bpd, with Texas accounting for most of it—3.9 million bpd, according to the S&P report quoted by the Houston Chronicle.According to the latest available EIA monthly data, U.S. crude oil exports hit the 2 million-bpd monthly mark for the first time in May this year, and exports held above 2.1 million bpd in June and July, with record (so far) monthly exports at 2.2 million bpd in June.Since the United States removed four-decade-long restrictions on crude oil exports at the end of 2015, U.S. exports have increased. Helped by higher oil prices that renewed shale activity, these exports have continued to rise over the past year and a half.At the same time, production in the Permian has surged, and the EIA estimates it at 3.427 million bpd in September, rising to 3.458 million bpd in October.However, the Permian production in West Texas and New Mexico has already outpaced pipeline takeaway capacity capable of transporting the crude oil to the Texas Gulf Coast.Related: “Profit Secrets of the World’s Most Successful Energy Investors”Midstream operators have planned and continue to announce plans for more oil pipeline projects in the area to ship oil from the Permian to the Gulf Coast. But many of those pipelines will not come on stream before late in 2019 and 2020, creating bottlenecks in the flow of the rising oil production to the Gulf Coast for exports.Until those constraints are overcome, inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, could build up, because the route to Cushing is not as constrained as the one to the Gulf Coast, according to Citigroup. Rising inventories at Cushing will put further pressure on the benchmark U.S. oil price, possibly widening its discount to Brent Crude to as much as $15 a barrel—which would be the widest WTI discount to the international benchmark since December 2013, Citigroup’s global head of commodities research Ed Morse says.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Crude-Oil-Exports-Could-Jump-To-Almost-4-Million-Bpd-By-2020.html,"Oct 09, 2018 at 10:30 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Oct 09, 2018",U.S. Crude Oil Exports Could Jump To Almost 4 Million Bpd By 2020
2018-10-09,"Production and operating costs of oil and gas field operators in the UK North Sea section went up by about 2 percent last year, the Oil and Gas Authority—the national industry watchdog—said in a new report.The total operating expenditure of North Sea oil and gas companies active in the region stood at a little over US$9 billion (6.9 billion pounds), the OGA said, adding that despite the slight climb, they were still 28 percent lower than costs in 2014 before oil prices collapsed.The authority has calculated the average cost per barrel of oil equivalent at US$15.17 (11.60 pounds) for 2017, which is pretty good considering the North Sea used to be one of the highest-cost oil and gas producing regions in the world.In the Southern North Sea and the Eastern Irish Sea, costs actually fell last year, while in the Central North Sea these costs were the highest. Even so, the data collected by the OGA showed that more than 50 percent of field operators in the area reduced their overall operating expenses last year from a year earlier, despite the fact that cost per barrel of oil equivalent rose for most of them.Recently, the North Sea has become a hot spot for M&A deals: Equinor earlier this month said it had agreed to buy Chevron’s stake in Rosebank, one of the largest undeveloped oil and gas finds in the British section of the North Sea. For Chevron, the deal is part of a larger plan to exit the North Sea in full. Marathon Oil announced it would leave the North Sea, too, and would instead focus on its domestic operations.Also recently, an independent company, EnQuest, bought the remainder of BP’s stake in the Magnus field. BP went on a selling spree in the North Sea last year, and even offloaded its Forties pipeline. Another local independent, Verus Petroleum, paid $400 million for stakes in several fields, sold by Japanese Itochu.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/North-Sea-Oil-Gas-Operating-Costs-Rose-Last-Year.html,"Oct 09, 2018 at 09:31 | Irina Slav","Oct 09, 2018",North Sea Oil & Gas Operating Costs Rose Last Year
