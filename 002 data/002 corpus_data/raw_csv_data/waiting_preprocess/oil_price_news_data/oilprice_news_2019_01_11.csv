2019-01-11,"Has financial disaster been averted in Canada’s oil and gas industry?‘Disaster’ is all relative. Let’s just say 2019 is going to be a difficult year following a tough set of recent circumstances.One thing we know is that the recent episode of bargain-basement commodity prices—triggered by a regional glut of oil and gas looking for a pipeline to call home, combined with low international oil prices—has wounded this year’s outlook for conventional oilfield activity. That’s the segment of the business, outside the oil sands, where two-thirds of the industry’s spending typically occurs.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Beyond the tight orbit of Fort McMurray’s oil sands, in the broader oil and gas fields of BC, Alberta and Saskatchewan, the overt indicator of sectoral health is drilling activity. Like counting cars on a freeway, you know the economy is bad if there are only a few commuters on the road.It’s looking pretty bad for the first quarter. We’re entering the peak ‘rush hour’ of the winter drilling season with only 180 bits turning on active rigs. The level of activity is feeling a lot like the depths of 2016, the lowest New Year’s entry in decades (see Figure 1).For comparison, last year at this time the rig count was climbing toward a more stable February peak of 348. But stability is hardly in the energy dictionary right now. Volatile discounts, weak international prices, illiquid equity markets and a never-ending pipeline drama has spooked those with money and hollowed those without. It’s pretty simple really: No confidence plus no money equals no drilling. That’s what was happening late last year.  Related: WoodMac: LNG Glut Not Likely In 2019Having said that, the very real potential for fiscal disaster was averted. To clear the late ’18 production glut, the government of Alberta stepped into the market with a mandatory oil curtailment (8.7 percent across the board). The goal was to restrain output until the market cleared. So far, the policy seems to be working. Domestic price discounts have snapped back to near-normal after accounting for usual quality and transportation differences. If 2019 plays out according to plan, the curtailment should be lifted by mid-year and various longer-term, market-balancing mechanisms—like increased rail movement, pipeline enhancements to boost unused capacity and other supply chain innovations—should keep the discounts in check.While the first quarter has a sinking feeling, the outlook heading into summer may be better. Spending and drilling should strengthen into the back half of the year, though there is little doubt that 2019 as a whole will record fewer new oil and gas wells compared to the 7,000 in each of the past two years.The current malaise is not only about Canadian issues, including pipeline delays, price discounts and policy angst. A major factor is top-line oil price. At benchmark Cushing, Oklahoma, a barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil has fallen below the psychological $US 50 mark.  Related: There Is Still Room To Run For Oil PricesBelow $US 50/B, many producers — state-owned and otherwise—feel a fiscal pinch. If sub-$50 lasts for more than a couple of months, worldwide drilling activity will pull back too.Yet there is a new resiliency in the world of oil. The competitive pressures of the last four years has forced adaptation to significantly lower prices as well as the additional costs of environmental pressures. Globally, leading multinationals and progressive independent operators with high-quality assets can now be quite active at $US 50/B; many are here in Canada. On the flip side, producers that are blind to innovation and still pining for $100/B remain troubled.Low prices and hard times are frustrating, disagreeable and outright demoralizing in any business (think retail). During such times, progressive companies sharpen their pencils and necessarily figure out how to adapt. This has been happening in the global oil and gas industry. And it’s been forced acutely on Canada’s industry where prices have stubbornly bobbed below international levels.Unfortunately, there is no sugar coating to be had. The start to 2019 is going to be a difficult one in the Canadian oil patch. But they say what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. Given all the forces of change at play, domestic and international, some in the industry will falter. Others will regroup and innovate, becoming leaner and stronger, ready to take on the 2020s.By Peter TertzakianMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Theres-No-Sugarcoating-Canadas-Oil-Crisis.html,"Jan 11, 2019 at 17:14 | Peter Tertzakian","Jan 11, 2019",There’s No Sugarcoating Canada’s Oil Crisis
2019-01-11,"In an attempt to combat a ballooning oil glut and dramatically plummeting prices, the premier of Alberta Rachel Notley introduced an unprecedented measure at the beginning of December when she is mandating that oil companies in her province cut production. This directive was particularly surprising in the context of Canada’s free market economy, where oil production is rarely so directly regulated.Canada’s recent oil glut woes are not due to a lack of demand, but rather a severe lack of pipeline infrastructure. There is plenty of demand, and more than enough supply, but no way to get the oil flowing where it needs to go. Canada’s pipelines are running at maximum capacity, storage facilities are filled to bursting, and the pipeline bottleneck has only continued to worsen. Now, in an effort to alleviate the struggling industry, Alberta’s oil production has been cut 8.7 percent according to the mandate set by the province’s government under Rachel Notley with the objective of cutting out around 325,000 barrels per day from the Canadian market.Even before the government stepped in, some private oil companies had already self-imposed production caps in order to combat the ever-expanding glut and bottomed-out oil prices. Cenovus Energy, Canadian Natural Resource, Devon Energy, Athabasca Oil, and others announced curtailments that totaled around 140,000 barrels a day and Cenovus Energy, one of Canada’s major producers, even went so far as to plead with the government to impose production caps late last year.So far, the government-imposed productive caps have been extremely successful. In October Canadian oil prices were so depressed that the Canadian benchmark oil Western Canadian Select (WCS) was trading at a whopping $50 per barrel less than United States benchmark oil West Texas Intermediate (WTI). now, in the wake of production cuts, the price gap between WCS and WTI has diminished by a dramatic margin to a difference of just under $13 per barrel.  Related: The Natural Gas Crash Isn’t OverWhile on the surface this would seem to be a roundly glowing review of the production caps in Alberta, production cuts are not a long-term solution for Canada’s oil glut woes. The current production caps in Canada are only intended to last through the middle of this year, at which point Canadian oil companies will be permitted to decrease their cutbacks to just 95,000 barrels per day fewer than the numbers from November 2018’s production rates. The cuts are a just a treatment, not a cure, for oversupply in Alberta. The problem needs to be addressed at its source--the pipelines.Unfortunately, the pipeline shortage in Alberta has no quick and easy fix. While there are multiple major pipeline projects underway, the two largest, the Keystone XL pipeline and the Trans Mountain pipeline, are stalled indefinitely thanks to legal woes and seemingly endless litigation. The Enbridge Line 3 pipeline, intended to replace one of the region’s already existing pipelines, is currently under construction and projected to be up and running by the end of the year, but will not go a long way toward fixing the bottleneck.Even if the Albertan government re-evaluates the present mid-2019 expiration date for the current stricter production cuts, extending the production caps could have enduring negative consequences in the region’s oil industry. Keeping a long-term cap on production in Alberta would potentially discourage investment in future production as well as in the infrastructure the local industry so sorely needs. According to some reporting, the cuts will not be able to control the gap between Canadian and U.S. oil for much longer anyway, just another downside to drawing out what should be a short-term solution. The government will need to weigh the possible outcomes very carefully as the expiration date approaches, when the and the pipeline shortage is still a long way from being solved and the price of oil remains dangerously variable. By Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Canadas-Crude-Oil-Production-Cuts-Are-Unsustainable.html,"Jan 11, 2019 at 16:57 | Haley Zaremba","Jan 11, 2019",Canada’s Crude Oil Production Cuts Are Unsustainable
2019-01-11,"U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures are trading lower on Friday after hitting their highest level since December 7 earlier in the session. Profit-taking is likely behind the weakness. However, there are still lingering concerns over rising U.S. production, and key issues with China that have to be resolved despite favorable trade talks earlier in the week. Underpinning the market are the OPEC-led production cuts.Bullish ScenarioOPEC and its major ally Russia began reducing output by 1.2 million barrels per day on January 1. It they maintain their discipline, this move should trim the global supply glut and stabilize prices.Earlier in the week, the US and China ended three-days of constructive trade talks which were productive enough to lead to the scheduling of further negotiations later this month. This news has created enough optimism to drive short-sellers out of the market.Bearish ScenarioThe bearish traders are saying that profit-taking and short-covering have been driving prices higher rather than aggressive counter-trend buyers.They are also expressing concerns over the health of the global economy especially in China where growth in 2018 and 2019 is expected to be the lowest since 1990. This could pressure demand.Furthermore, most analysts have downgraded their global economic growth forecasts below 3 percent for 2019. This will also be bad for demand.Finally, the biggest concerns for bullish traders…					    ",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Profit-Taking-Ends-Massive-Rally-In-Crude.html,"Jan 11, 2019 at 16:52 | Jim Hyerczyk","Jan 11, 2019",Profit Taking Ends Massive Rally In Crude
2019-01-11,"Energy professionals and others following the developments in the oil and gas industry during the last couple of years have witnessed a massive rise in reporting concerning hydraulic fracturing technology. The role of conventional oil could easily be undervalued considering the rising importance of shale oil. Although hydraulic fracturing has changed the market significantly, conventional producers still make up the bulk of today’s oil mix. Production of shale oil in the U.S. is poised to grow even further in the coming years. However, basic economic fundamentals such as profitability and availability bode well for conventional producers and especially for those in the Middle East.Conventional oil’s technical and geographic soft spotDespite shale oil’s impressive rise in production, the majority of the world’s oil is produced from conventional fields which hold around two-thirds of the global recoverable resources. OPEC’s member countries possess the bulk of these assets with nearly 82 percent of the total. Of this amount, 65 percent is in the Middle East, led by Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, and the UAE. The technical advantages of oil recovery from this region are that production is relatively easy and cheap. ‘Black Gold’ in the Middle East is amassed in large deposits near the surface either onshore or in relatively shallow waters. This means that the world’s oil producers with the lowest breakeven costs are Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Iraq with costs between the $9 and $10 dollars a barrel in 2016. The immense size of Middle Eastern oil fields and the relative ease with which it can be extracted, have made it the most important oil production region since the Second World War.Conventional oil’s decreasing role outside of the Middle EastThe world produced almost 100 million bpd per day in 2018. Both production and consumption are set to rise even further in 2019. Conventional production beyond the Middle East peaked in 2010 and expectations are that production will continue to fall to 45.6 million barrels a day in 2020 which is a 2.3 mb/d decline from the current level. Furthermore, global consumption is set to rise even further reaching 112 mb/d in 2040. This additional demand will be met primarily by U.S. shale, new deepwater oil production and conventional oil producers from the Middle East.  Related: OPEC’s No.2 Boosted Production, Exports Just Before Cuts Began(Click to enlarge)Analysts expect Middle Eastern oil production to grow by 2.7 mb/d by 2025. The extra barrels will be supplied by Iraq (approx. 1.5 mb/d) and by the presumed resumption of production in the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The UAE hasn’t announced large production increases but the Emirates have the capacity to do so when proper investments are made. Also, statements concerning Iran’s future level of production are unreliable due to political risks associated with the Trump administration or any future President’s policy vis-à-vis Tehran.Shale oil’s influence on global pricesTraditionally OPEC has dominated global oil markets and price setting. However, with the introduction of shale oil, a new bandwidth has been introduced. Following the experience of the last couple of years concerning wild oil price swings, most analysts agree that U.S. shale oil production growth is capped by $50 dollars a barrel. The price of WTI indexed oil was on average $48 (2015) and $43 (2016). The price of oil below $50 has caused a decreasing of activity in the shale oil sector in the U.S.  Related: Maduro Clings To Power As Venezuela’s Oil Collapse ContinuesThe flexibility of fracking technology and quick investment returns mean that U.S. shale producers are sensitive to price swings. This, in turn, introduces a new balancing force in the oil market meaning that when price drop below $50, economic activity will also reduce quickly in the shale oil production areas. The same logic is also applied when prices rise towards $70, when most shale oil fields become profitable, and increased production lowers prices again.  Conventional vs. shaleThe major difference between shale and conventional oil producers is flexibility meaning that the former can produce oil in a shorter period of time with lower investments. However, the introduction of a new ceiling for oil prices could also be good news for conventional producers in the long term in especially the Middle East. The price for a barrel of oil will most likely hover between $40 and $70 dollars. This will ensure a steady demand while EVs face strong competition from the combustion engine due to low energy prices. Taking into consideration the relatively low production costs of Middle Eastern energy, the biggest oil reserves in the world and growing demand globally, producers in the region continue to reap the rewards in the long term.(Click to enlarge)By Vanand Meliksetian for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Are-Conventional-Producers-Really-Losing-Influence.html,"Jan 11, 2019 at 16:44 | Vanand Meliksetian","Jan 11, 2019",Are Conventional Producers Really Losing Influence?
2019-01-11,"Baker Hughes reported no change to the number of active oil and gas in the United States this week.The total number of active oil and gas drilling rigs is holding steady at 1,075 according to the report, with the number of active oil rigs decreasing by 4 to reach 873 and the number of gas rigs increasing by 4 to reach 202.The oil and gas rig count is now 136 up from this time last year, 121 of which is in oil rigs.WTI prices were down on Friday despite newfound hopes that trade talks between China and the United States will prove fruitful soon.At 12:25pm EDT, the WTI benchmark was trading down $0.75 (-1.43%) at $51.94—up week on week, with Brent crude trading down $0.87 (-1.41%) at $60.81 per barrel—also up week on week. Today’s price decline marks the end to a more than week-long uptrend for prices that reached a five-week high, after a particularly volatile 2018, even by oil industry’s standards.Canada’s oil and gas rigs increased by 108 rigs this week—a rather abrupt halt to the 4-week losing streak that saw the energy-rich but infrastructure-poor country lose about 100 rigs over the last four weeks as drillers are gearing up for winter season. Canada’s total oil and gas rig count is now 184, which is 92 fewer rigs than this time last year, with a 83-rig increase for oil rigs, and a 25-rig increase for gas rigs for the week. Canada’s falling rig count is likely due in part to a new mandate that called for the country to collectively shave 300,000 bpd off its crude oil production figures.The EIA’s estimates for US production for the week ending January 4 has the United States holding fast at an average rate of 11.7 million bpd­ for the week.By 1:07pm EDT, WTI had decreased by 1.73% (-$0.91) at $51.68 on the day.
