2019-01-16,"The recent slide in oil prices may finally start impacting U.S. oil production forecasts.The plunge in oil prices in November and December spread gloom around the industry. Comments from anonymous oil executives in a survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas from earlier this month clearly depicted the creeping pessimism from oil country. “I expect the dramatic, unexpected and significant drop in oil prices will significantly decrease revenue for the first half of 2019. I intend to mitigate this by stopping all drilling and deferring any new projects,” one oil executive told the Dallas Fed.Another worried about lack of financing for drilling. “It feels like the capital markets (equity and debt) are backing up fairly hard, which will have a noted impact on capital spending if sustained. Coupled with the fall in oil prices in the past six weeks, this could cause 2019 plans to get pared back,” the executive said.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();But the downturn in oil prices, and even the gloomier outlook from oil executives themselves, hadn’t really fed through to oil production forecasts. The projections for U.S. shale still included heady growth figures, despite the plunge in prices.That is, until now.“As a result of the slide in oil prices over the past three months, operators have already started to guide down activity for 2019 compared to their initial plans to ramp up activity,” Rystad Energy wrote in a new commentary. “Consequentially, we have lowered our expectations for oil production growth by about 500,000 bpd for 2020 and 2021, implying less need for takeaway capacity.”Rystad says slower production growth might put a lot less urgency on the closely watched midstream bottlenecks. “This raises the question as to which (if any) of the pipelines projects in the Permian slated for development will move forward if there is less oil to fill them,” Rystad stated.

At times in 2018, Midland WTI traded at a discount approaching $20 per barrel relative to WTI in Houston. But Midland prices have converged towards WTI, with a discount of only around $6 per barrel more recently. Much of that has to do with some of the pipeline capacity additions in recent months.Slower production growth going forward could scramble the case for new pipelines. “Given our current production outlook, we see marginal need for the pipelines that have not been approved yet before 2022,” Rystad concluded. “This equates to about 2.7 million bpd capacity over six pipelines.”The oil consultancy singled out Phillips 66’s proposed Gray Oak pipeline expansion as one example. Rystad said that “there’s a likelihood that sufficient commitments won’t be reached,” meaning there won’t be demand for the 200,000-bpd proposed expansion because upstream production will slow.The U.S. added 1.6 million barrels per day of new supply in 2018, the largest annual increase in history. But growth will slow to a still-enormous 1.1 mb/d this year, and 0.8 mb/d in 2020, according to the EIA’s latest Short-Term Energy Outlook. Curiously, however, the EIA’s estimate that U.S. output will average 12.1 mb/d in 2019 is unchanged since its November estimate, even though it has revised down its price forecast significantly. Forthcoming revisions in the months ahead wouldn’t be surprising.The EIA did suggest, however, that U.S. oil production won’t return to the explosive growth rates of 2018. The agency attributes a more modest growth rate this year and next to pipeline constraints. The agency notes that lower oil prices could curtail drilling, but it says that once new pipelines come online later this year, production growth will rebound into 2020. It’s not clear what to make of this, in light of the recent price meltdown.  Related: Offshore Spending To Overtake Shale In 2019In the short run, there is some evidence to support the notion that lower prices are impacting output. The oil rig count fell by 4 last week, according to Baker Hughes, and is at a roughly three-month low at 873.Also, the EIA weekly production data, which offers a preliminary look into U.S. oil output, has been roughly unchanged at 11.7 mb/d since November. These numbers are a little rough, and are at times out of synch with the more accurate monthly surveys that come out on a several-month lag, but they offer a near real-time glimpse into production. The data suggests that output began to plateau in November.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Oil-Outlook-Slammed-By-Lower-Prices.html,"Jan 16, 2019 at 15:55 | Nick Cunningham","Jan 16, 2019",U.S. Oil Outlook Slammed By Lower Prices
2019-01-16,"Ambivalent is the word that best describes the condition Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has found himself in. From a formal point of view, his January 10 reinauguration went along smoothly and oil production, the backbone of Venezuelan economy, has managed to bounce back somewhat from the trough it has found itself this autumn. Yet if you look closely, navigating through 2019 might turn out to be even more difficult for the Bolivarian leader than surviving the arduous year of 2018. International pressure is mounting, including Caribbean countries that thusfar have been either supportive or neutral towards the Venezuelan political leadership, all the while PDVSA still struggles to become a „normal” national oil company.But first let’s talk a bit about Venezuela’s success stories. After the steady declines in oil output witnessed in the first half of 2018, plummeting from 1.65 mbpd in January to 1.25 mbpd, production has stabilized somewhat around 1.15mbpd mark. PDVSA attributes this to the improved functioning of the three upgraders operating in the country, used for creating synthetic export grades out of the bitumenous 8-10° API crudes that the Orinoco Belt yields. The now-working crude upgraders are inevitably linked to foreign oil majors – PetroMonagas is developed with Rosneft, PetroPiar with Chevron, PetroCedeno with Total and Equinor – as the fourth upgrader, fully owned by PDVSA, has been out of operation for…					    ",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/How-Much-Further-Can-Venezuelas-Oil-Production-Fall.html,"Jan 16, 2019 at 15:24 | Editorial Dept","Jan 16, 2019",How Much Further Can Venezuela’s Oil Production Fall?
2019-01-16,"A week after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was sworn in for a second term in office, the option of a complete oil embargo against Venezuela has been put back on the table, according to two unnamed sources who spoke to CNN.The sources also said President Trump was mulling over a declaration that recognizes the President of the Venezuelan National Assembly, opposition politician Juan Guaido, as the legitimate president of the country.While officials from the U.S. administration did not directly confirm the information, CNN quoted the spokesman of the National Security Council, Garrett Marquis, as saying “The United States is currently considering all diplomatic, political, and economic tools in its arsenal in response to the usurpation of power by the illegitimate Maduro regime.”googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();The last time more sanctions against Venezuela’s government were discussed actively in Washington, a source from the administration said a full oil embargo was not among the options discussed.“The fact is that the greatest sanction on Venezuelan oil and oil production is called Nicolas Maduro, and PDVSA’s inefficiencies,” the official said, speaking to Reuters. “At the end of the day, Nicolas Maduro has taken care of really running PDVSA to the ground, and essentially more and more making it a non-factor.”Interestingly enough, however, despite the steady decline in Venezuela’s oil production, daily exports of crude to United States refineries have remained relatively stable. According to the latest data from the Energy Information Administration, between May and October 2018, Venezuelan crude exports to the U.S. hovered around half a million barrels daily. While this is substantially lower than the export rate from the late 1990s, it’s not as low as it was a decade earlier, between 1980 and 1985. And U.S. refiners might need more.  Related: U.S.-Qatar Energy Partnership Has Russia On EdgeLate last year, Alberta’s Premier Rachel Notley ordered a cut of over 300,000 bpd in local crude oil production to prop up prices. It worked so well, now some analysts are worrying there may be a shortage of heavy crude on the way as Saudi Arabia is also cutting production and when it cuts, these analysts said, it cuts mostly its heavy crude production.However, most refineries on the Gulf Coast, where more than half of the world’s crude is processed, need heavy crude and there are but a few competitive sources they can tap if the supply of heavy crude becomes too tight for comfort, which may well happen if Trump goes ahead with an export embargo.The idea of an oil embargo, CNN notes, has been previously rejected by the U.S. President because it would lead to a jump in prices at the pump of as much as 15 percent. This is not something Trump seems to be fine with, as evidenced by his reactions to rising prices in the spring and early summer of last year and his urging OPEC to stop cutting production and let prices go lower. Based on this, chances are the U.S. president will stop short of imposing a full oil embargo on Venezuela, especially amid a tightening heavy crude market.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Trump-Takes-Aim-At-Maduro-Threatens-Oil-Embargo.html,"Jan 16, 2019 at 13:42 | Irina Slav","Jan 16, 2019","Trump Takes Aim At Maduro, Threatens Oil Embargo"
2019-01-16,"Rystad Energy forecasts offshore spending will outgrow spending on onshore shale activities this year. Service companies exposed to the offshore subsea market and the maintenance, modifications and operations (MMO) sector are set to benefit from this trend reversal.At current oil price levels, spending on land rigs, fracking and other services for the shale industry is likely to stay essentially flat in 2019. The offshore service market, too, will feel the effects of the recent oil price slide, but this sector is nevertheless projected to grow by a robust 4% this year, according to Rystad Energy forecasts.“Many would expect offshore spending to be cut as drastically as shale, but offshore budgets were at a 10-year low last year, after four years of intense cost focus, and from that level you don’t need much additional activity or inflation to drive up the market,” Rystad Energy head of oilfield services research Audun Martinsen said.(Click to enlarge)Since oil prices fell in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the oil market outlook for 2019 appeared more bearish, shale budgets for next year have been cut drastically to compensate for the anticipated loss of revenues.“We saw the tendency already last month that the shale service market started to hit the brakes. The number of fracked wells per day dropped from an average of around 50 wells per day to 44 wells per day, and frack service pricing continued to fall in the fourth quarter of 2018. For the full year of 2019 we expect more or less the same number of wells completed, at around 20,000 wells, and we do not anticipate seeing utilization returning to the levels as seen in early 2018,” Martinsen said.Rystad Energy expects the uptick in offshore spending to be driven by exploration and greenfield projects. In addition, operational expenditure (opex) budgets will likely swell thanks to cost inflation, more fields coming on stream, and a buildup of work that needs to be completed.  Related: Fears Of U.S. Shale Demise May Be OverblownNew research from Rystad Energy shows the inflection point for when the short cycle shale business could again grow faster than offshore. According to this research, a price of $64 per barrel of Brent crude would see both shale and offshore grow at around 5%, but in a scenario where Brent climbs to $70 per barrel, the shale industry could achieve an impressive 14% growth.(Click to enlarge)“Investors now need to position their bets correctly based on their price strip assumptions. As long as oil prices are below $60 a barrel for Brent it could be interesting to take a second look at service contractors exposed to the offshore sector to see what they have to offer as compared to service companies exposed to shale,” Martinsen added.By breaking down capex and opex budgets across resource types, and allocating the spending to the associated service segments, Rystad Energy estimates revenue growth based on known backlog, latest contract awards and regional exposure.“It seems that the names that will be able to deliver the best revenue growth are the service companies exposed to the offshore subsea market and MMO. This is a clear switch from 2018, when it was the shale names that were market share winners in the global service market,” Martinsen concludes.By Rystad EnergyMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Offshore-Spending-To-Overtake-Shale-In-2019.html,"Jan 16, 2019 at 13:22 | Rystad Energy ","Jan 16, 2019",Offshore Spending To Overtake Shale In 2019
2019-01-16,"The Energy Information Administration reported a crude oil inventory decline of 2.7 million barrels for the week to January 11 but the report failed to have any palpable effect on oil prices. Inventories are about 8 percent above the five-year average for the season.Yesterday, the American Petroleum Institute had reported an uncharacteristically modest estimated inventory draw of 560,000 barrels for last week.The EIA said refineries in the U.S. had processed an average 17.2 million barrels of crude daily in the seven days to January 11, producing 9.6 million bpd of gasoline and 5.4 million bpd of distillate fuel. This compares with an average processing rate of 17.6 million bpd a week earlier, and gasoline production of 9.4 million bpd, with distillate fuel production at 5.6 million bpd.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Gasoline inventories, the EIA said, added a whopping 7.5 million bpd last week, with distillate fuel inventories rising by 3 million barrels.This week’s inventory report comes on the heels of EIA’s latest Short-Term Energy Outlook, which is the first that covers not just this year but also 2020. In both these years, the United States will increasingly become a major force to reckon with in oil. Last year, the EIA said, crude oil production in the country rose by as much as 2.2 million bpd and the rise will continue this year and next.

This growing production will continue to shrink imports, from 2.4 million bpd last year to 1.1 million bpd this year and to less than 100,000 bpd in 2020. At the end of 2020, the EIA expects the U.S. to become a net exporter of crude oil.Meanwhile, prices remain around US$50 for West Texas Intermediate and US$60 for Brent crude as OPEC+ begin cutting production but worries about the global economy persist.At the time of writing, WTI was trading at US$52.20 a barrel, with Brent crude at US$60.85 a barrel.

2019-01-16,"The Energy Information Administration expects OPEC’s combined crude oil production this year to be 1 million barrels per day lower than in 2018, when the cartel produced an average 31.92 million bpd, the authority said in its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook.This, however, won’t be enough to push prices higher if the EIA turns out correct about the trend in non-OPEC production, led by the United States, which the EIA sees rising by 2.4 million bpd this year from last. In 2020, OPEC’s production is likely to remain flat on 2019, with all the growth in global supply coming from the United States, Brazil, Canada, and Russia, the EIA also said. This is the authority’s first STEO that covers 24 months.Among OPEC members, the EIA sees Iraq as one major driver of production growth but it also assumes U.S. sanctions against Iran will remain in place until the end of 2020, which, coupled with expectations that Venezuela’s oil production will continue to fall, means production growth in Iraq will not be enough to offset the negative supply effect of developments in Iran and Venezuela.Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s de facto leader and also biggest producer, interestingly, would not be able—or willing—to contribute to growth in production, according to the EIA. The agency said this year Saudi Arabia will produce an average of less than the 10.4 million bpd average rate of production it booked for 2018.Angola and Nigeria, on the other hand, will pump more oil this year, the EIA also said in its projections for OPEC. Angola started up production at two new fields last year: Kaombo, which it will this year expand it with a second phase of development, and Vandumbu, which began production ahead of schedule in late 2018.In Nigeria, the offshore Egina field, operated by Total, began production at the start of this year. At peak production, Egina will have the capacity to pump 200,000 bpd, which is equal to about 10 percent of Nigeria’s current rate of production.
