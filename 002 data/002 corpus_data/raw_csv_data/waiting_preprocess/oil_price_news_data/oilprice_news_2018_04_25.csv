2018-04-25,"After API surprised markets with a 1.1-million-barrel build in crude oil inventories yesterday, the EIA reinforced the mood by reporting a 2.2-million-barrel build for the week to April 20.Analysts had expected a modest build of 290,000 barrels in the period.The authority also said gasoline inventories had gone up by 800,000 barrels in the reporting period, compared with a 3-million-barrel decline a week earlier. Distillate inventories last week fell by 2.6 million barrels, from a drop of 3.1 million barrels reported for the prior week.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Gasoline production averaged 9.9 million barrels daily last week, the EIA also said, and distillate production stood at 5 million bpd. This compares with 10.2 million bpd of gasoline and 5.1 million bpd of distillate a week earlier. Refineries processed 16.6 million bpd of crude.The effect of EIA’s latest inventory report on oil prices would be interesting to watch; API’s figures seemed to remind market players that not all fundamentals are bullish for oil, with U.S. oil production continuing to be the main headwind for OPEC’s plans to push up prices higher. This week’s full report, out later today, are bound to reinforce this reminder—U.S. production has been growing steadily since late 2017.

Even so, as Bloomberg reports, WTI has gained as much as 7 percent since the start of April on the back of these geopolitical concerns and the latest round of self-praise from the OPEC camp. These were supported by a further decline in Venezuela’s crude oil production.President Trump will announce his decision about the Iran deal on May 12.At the time of writing, WTI traded at US$67.80 a barrel, with Brent crude at US$72.91 a barrel.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Prices-Dip-On-Crude-Gasoline-Build.html,"Apr 25, 2018 at 09:44 | Irina Slav","Apr 25, 2018","Oil Prices Dip On Crude, Gasoline Build"
2018-04-25,"The Permian Basin has long been touted as the fastest growing shale play in the United States, but now its oil-producing prowess is being highlighted again as the Energy Information Administration forecasts the prolific basin’s May production to be 3.183 million bpd—an expected 73,000 bpd rise from April.The Permian play may very well, as Bloomberg Markets suggests, become the largest oil patch in the world over the next decade.If The Permian Was Part of OPECgoogletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();The United States is quickly become a major contender for top oil producer in the world, producing 10.540 million bpd as of week ending April 13. That’s more than Saudi Arabia (9.934 million bpd as of the latest MMOR), and just a hair below that of the world’s top producer, Russia, who produced 10.97 million bpd in March 2018, according to Russia’s Energy Ministry.Besides OPEC’s powerhouse Saudi Arabia, the next largest OPEC producer is But the Permian alone, with its expected production of 3.183 million bpd next month Iraq at 4.426 million bpd, followed by Iran at 3.814 million bpd. If the Permian were part of OPEC, it would be its number three producer.And unlike Iraq and Iran which have production quotas to contend with as part of their OPEC duties, for the Permian, the sky is the limit, constrained only by the size of its massive reserves. Even when prices were low, oil production increased in the Permian, increasing every month but three from January 2016 to March 2017, according to the EIA.On top of the Permian’s large reserves, technology has played a major role in helping the Permian achieve its high marks.“The technology is the biggest driver,” said Rob Thummel, managing director and Portfolio Manager – Energy at Tortoise, which handles $16 billion in energy-related assets. “The basin in and of itself could end up being the largest oil field in the world.""By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Permian-On-Track-To-Become-Largest-Oil-Basin-In-The-World.html,"Apr 25, 2018 at 09:02 | Julianne Geiger","Apr 25, 2018",Permian On Track To Become Largest Oil Basin In The World
