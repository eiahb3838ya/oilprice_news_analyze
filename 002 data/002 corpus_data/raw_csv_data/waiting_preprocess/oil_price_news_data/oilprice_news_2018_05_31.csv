2018-05-31,"The Wall Street Journal recently reported that only five of the Top 20 U.S. oil companies focused mostly on hydraulic fracking generated more cash than they spent in the first quarter of this year. This continues a trend that has been ongoing throughout the fracking boom.Winners and LosersThe article doesn’t list the cash flow picture for the entire Top 20, nor did it explain how it calculated cash flow. But based on the numbers they reported and my own analysis, it appears they are defining cash flow as simply the amount of cash generated from operations minus capital expenditures.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();The story indicated that overall, companies spent $1.13 for every $1 they took in. It further noted that “Oasis Petroleum Inc. spent $3.27 for every $1 it made in cash, while Parsley Energy Inc. spent almost $2 for every $1 it made in cash.”Hedging was blamed for the underwhelming cash flow. The article noted that many producers hedged oil prices at $50 to $55 a barrel, and were therefore unable to cash in on the rally in oil prices. Of course, that makes you wonder why a company would hedge at a price that they should have known would result in negative cash flow.Continental Resources infamously ditched its hedges in 2014 after oil prices declined to $75/bbl. The company expected prices to bounce back quickly. Continental hasn’t yet resumed hedging but expects to do so at some point. Notably, Continental was reported to have the highest cash flow among its peers at $258 million for Q1. EOG Resources was also highlighted for generating a $110 million cash surplus for the quarter.  Related: Higher Prices To Help Oil Companies Refinance $400B In DebtThe article doesn’t name the other companies that generated positive cash flow, but I screened the data from the S&P Global Market Intelligence database and calculated it myself. The numbers I calculated for Continental and EOG matched the numbers reported in the WSJ article, so I used the same calculation for the rest of the companies.Presumably, the WSJ story didn’t include ConocoPhillips in its analysis, as it led all oil companies (considering just the pure oil and gas producers) with cash flow of $864 million for the quarter. COP is the largest pure oil and gas producer, and like Continental, they aren’t hedged. But their oil and gas operations are geographically diverse, and they aren’t purely a fracking play.Other companies generating positive cash flow among the 20 largest oil and gas producers by enterprise value (excluding the supermajor integrated companies) were EQT at $172 million, Chesapeake at $148 million, Cabot Oil & Gas at $117 million, and Cimarex at $41 million. The biggest overall cash flow loser in the Top 20 was Pioneer Natural Resources, which outspent its cash flow by $264 million.No Permian WinnersNotably, despite the surge of oil production in the Permian Basin, none of the companies that generated positive cash flow in Q1 operate either exclusively or mostly within the Permian Basin.  Related: Is A Natural Gas Pipeline Between Alaska And China Realistic?Continental operates primarily in two areas: The Bakken in North Dakota and the SCOOP/STACK in Oklahoma. EOG has operations scattered across the midcontinent, as well as some international production. ConocoPhillips has a diverse production portfolio. The others generating positive cash flow are primarily natural gas companies, or have a large chunk of production outside of the Permian.The lack of cash flow among Permian producers can be partially attributed to logistical constraints in the Permian that won’t likely be relieved until 2019. But it’s also a function of companies investing heavily into the Permian in anticipation of future production.To be clear, it isn’t necessarily a concern if a company occasionally has negative cash flow. Companies invest for the future, and if their outlook is for higher oil prices then they may invest significantly. But this increases the level of risk for these companies, as a prolonged oil price slump could financially strain the big spenders.In conclusion, I will note that most oil companies are moving in the right direction, even if some aren’t doing so quickly enough. My screen of the Top 80 U.S. and Canadian oil and gas companies showed cumulative cash flow from the group at -$669 million for Q1 2018. A year ago, that number was -$6.9 billion.By Robert RapierMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Why-Arent-Permian-Oil-Producers-Profitable.html,"May 31, 2018 at 16:35 | Robert Rapier","May 31, 2018",Why Aren’t Permian Oil Producers Profitable?
2018-05-31,"OPEC’s oil production dropped in May by 70,000 bpd to 32.00 million bpd on the back of outages in Nigeria and a continuous decline in Venezuela that dragged the cartel’s total production to the lowest level since April 2017, according to the monthly Reuters survey.The largest fall in production was registered in Nigeria, according to the survey based on shipping data from external sources, Thomson Reuters flows data, and information provided by sources at OPEC and oil and consulting firms. Nigeria’s production dropped to 1.85 million bpd in May from 1.94 million bpd in April, the Reuters survey found. Nigeria has been struggling with unplanned shutdowns of pipeline flows this month, and loading of the Forcados grade is being delayed.The second-largest fall in May came from Venezuela, whose production declined to 1.45 million bpd from 1.50 million bpd, compared to the implied target of 1.972 million bpd, which means that Venezuela’s involuntary “cut” in May was 617,000 bpd—more than the cut pledged and achieved by OPEC’s biggest producer Saudi Arabia.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Saudi Arabia, for its part, as well as the second-largest producer in the cartel, Iraq, slightly raised their production in May over April. Saudi Arabia stayed within its quota and its production inched up to 10.00 million bpd because more crude oil was consumed domestically by power plants, according to sources in the Reuters survey.  Related: The Oil Giant That Outsmarted TrudeauIraq produced more because it increased exports from its southern ports, following a drop last month.According to the latest available figures by OPEC’s secondary sources—the ones that OPEC uses to measure quotas and compliance with the deal, OPEC’s production in April increased by 12,000 bpd over March, to average 31.93 million bpd, as Saudi Arabia boosted its production by 46,500 bpd. The increase in Saudi Arabia (still within its quota under the deal), as well as small increases in Algeria, Iran, and Libya, were offset by another slump in Venezuela’s production and lower output in Angola, Nigeria, and Qatar.Venezuela’s crude oil production in April plunged by 41,700 bpd from March to average 1.436 million bpd, according to OPEC’s secondary sources.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Reuters-OPEC-Production-Falls-To-13-Month-Low.html,"May 31, 2018 at 14:12 | Tsvetana Paraskova","May 31, 2018",Reuters: OPEC Production Falls To 13-Month Low
2018-05-31,"Crude oil prices moved higher today after the Energy Information Administration reported a draw in crude oil inventories of 4.2 million barrels for the week to May 25, a day after the API pressured benchmarks by estimating an unexpected inventory increase of 1 million barrels for the period.Analysts had expected a build of 920,000 barrels for last week, after a 5.8-million-barrel increase a week earlier.In gasoline, the EIA reported a 500,000-barrel increase in inventories, with average daily production at 10.4 million barrels. This compares with a 1.9-million-barrel build in gasoline inventories a week earlier and a daily production rate of just over 10 million barrels a week earlier.Distillate inventories, the EIA said in this week’s report, were up 600,000 barrels, with daily production averaging 5.3 million barrels. A week before, distillate inventories booked a 1-million-barrel draw and a daily production rate of 4.9 million barrels.Brent crude and WTI started sliding last week on reports that Russia and Saudi Arabia were discussing an increase in oil production but recouped some of their losses this week, after OECD inventories, according to OPEC, fell below the five-year average, which was the goal of the 2016 production cut agreement.  Related: Why U.S. Oil Exports Are Only Heading HigherHowever, the surprise inventory build reported by API weighed on benchmarks, yet again proving the oil market is suffering from excessive price volatility. This may ease in the coming weeks as trader start pricing in an increase in OPEC and Russia production, although all OPECF and Russia sources that have commented on the topic have made it clear no decision had been made yet and will only be made at the June 22 meeting of the OPEC+ group.At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at US$78.27 a barrel, with WTI at US$67.20. Some analysts believe that despite the possibility of higher OPEC and Russia production, oil’s fundamentals remain bullish for the time being. U.S. production is also likely to have risen last week, from 10.725 million bpd last week.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Prices-Rebound-As-Crude-Inventories-Shrink.html,"May 31, 2018 at 10:10 | Irina Slav","May 31, 2018",Oil Prices Rebound As Crude Inventories Shrink
