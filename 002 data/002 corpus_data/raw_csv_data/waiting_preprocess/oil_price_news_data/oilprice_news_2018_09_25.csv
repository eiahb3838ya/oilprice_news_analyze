2018-09-25,"At the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump was laughed at by global leaders when he boasted about his accomplishments. He may feel insulted by the reception he got in New York, but a day earlier his administration saw a more tangible display of how much the international community opposes some of his policies.On Monday, the European Union announced a decision to launch a “special purpose vehicle” with the mission of helping Iran blunt the impact of U.S. sanctions. Iran is still in compliance with its obligations under the 2015 nuclear deal, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the P5+1 signatories – aside from the U.S. – remain firmly in the deal. “We are not backing down [on the Iran nuclear agreement],” said a European diplomat, according to the Wall Street Journal.The U.S. is nearly friendless in its quest to tear up the Iran nuclear deal, save for Saudi Arabia and Israel, and the EU’s initiative is intended to keep the accord alive. China and Russia offered their support for the new financing vehicle.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();But, despite their support, Iran has been hit hard by U.S. sanctions as the world dials back on its purchases from Iran. The Iranian rial has plunged in value this year and oil exports are expected to continue to decline. Without the benefits of the nuclear deal, Iran has little incentive to remain in the accord and may eventually bow out.“Mindful of the urgency and the need for tangible results, the participants welcomed practical proposals to maintain and develop payment channels, notably the initiative to establish a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to facilitate payments related to Iran's exports, including oil,” Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the EU announced in a joint statement. The goal is “to protect the freedom of their economic operators to pursue legitimate business with Iran.”The EU’s plan consists of an entity setup for the sole purpose of processing payments for companies doing business with Iran. This would allow European companies to buy oil from Iran without fear of getting hit by U.S. sanctions. The trade would presumably take place in a currency other than the greenback because of U.S. sanctions on dollar transactions.  Related: OPEC: IMO Rules Will Boost Oil Demand By 400,000 BpdTo be sure, the U.S. still wields unparalleled power over the fate of Iran’s oil exports, and has already succeeded in disrupting a larger share of Iranian supply than most analysts had predicted. Estimates from earlier this year pegged Iran’s losses at around 400,000-500,000 bpd, but more recent estimates put the losses at 1 million barrels per day (mb/d), or perhaps even more, by the end of the year. Iran’s oil exports fell to 3.584 mb/d in August, down 150,000 bpd from a month earlier.The ability of the U.S. to demand compliance from so many countries is a testament to the power of the American-oriented international financial system and the strength of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. Still, there are those that believe the aggressive use of sanctions will backfire on the dollar in the long run. In the future, the effort by the P5+1 nations to setup an alternative payments system may be viewed as a turning point, a small but highly symbolic attempt at undermining dollar dominance.In the short run, it is unclear if the effort will have an impact. “The question is whether this will work, because of course the US will continue to exert colossal pressure on the European Union and, with a strong desire, can easily trample down any mechanism,” Vladimir Yermakov, director of the department for non-proliferation and arms control at the Russian foreign ministry, told reporters, according to the FT. “Everything depends on how far the Americans want to go and how far our European colleagues will allow them to go.”  Related: JP Morgan: Expect Brent Oil To Reach $90 On Iran SanctionsIt is not clear that European companies will be convinced to trust the “special purpose vehicle” setup by the EU or that buying Iranian oil will go unpunished by Washington. Already, Total SA has withdrawn from a major natural gas project in Iran, and other major European companies such as Peugeot, Renault and Siemens have also suspended their Iranian operations. There is little prospect of their return.Refiners in Europe have dramatically cut their imports of Iranian oil, which has been an important factor in the decline of Iran’s oil exports. That also seems unlikely to change.Without the decisions by individual private companies to continue to do business with Iran, the EU initiative could be rendered symbolic.

2018-09-25,"OPEC and allies snubbed calls from U.S. President Donald Trump to lower oil prices, saying on Sunday that they are satisfied with the “overall healthy balance between supply and demand.”The key ministers of the OPEC+ deal participants, however, assured reporters and the market that their respective oil-producing countries have spare oil production capacity to meet demand by customers, if need be.The key message from the energy ministers of Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was that if demand calls for higher production, they would be ready to respond. But right now, the oil market is fairly balanced, and OPEC and friends won’t rush to supply more oil than its customers want and need, as they are careful not to tip the market into oversupply that would chip away at their oil revenues once again.Although OPEC+ didn’t decide to immediately boost oil production in this balanced market, as they view it, questions remain as to how much spare capacity that Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Russia can bring online in case the market significantly tightens in November when U.S. sanctions on Iran snap back and Venezuela’s production drops to new lows.The UAE is planning to boost its total oil production capacity to 3.5 million bpd by the end of this year, the emirates’ Energy Minister Suhail Al-Mazrouei told S&P Global Platts in an interview after the OPEC/non-OPEC panel met on Sunday to discuss the state of the market.The UAE—OPEC’s fourth-largest producer after Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Iran—currently produces just below 3 million bpd. At 2.972 million bpd in August, its oil production increased by 12,000 bpd from July, according to OPEC’s secondary sources.The UAE is also investing in additional crude oil storage, Al-Mazrouei told Platts, but noted that the country would not overproduce. Instead, it would lift its production only if there is demand for such increase.The UAE and other countries are not worried about market instability if they have spare capacity, the minister said, adding that his country would invest some US$109 billion in upstream projects over the next four to five years.Despite the spare capacity of some OPEC members, “We are not going to come back and significantly oversupply the market and create that imbalance again,” Al-Mazrouei told CNBC on the sidelines of the OPEC/non-OPEC panel meeting on Sunday.  According to the plans, by the end of the year, the UAE will have a spare production capacity of 500,000 bpd, which, estimates by Platts show, would be the second-highest after that of Saudi Arabia.  Related: JP Morgan: Expect Brent Oil To Reach $90 On Iran SanctionsRussia, the leader of the non-OPEC group in the production cut deal, can bring “a couple of hundred thousand barrels” in the short term, by December this year, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told Bloomberg in an interview this weekend.Nevertheless, the participants in the deal will look first into demand before making any additional decisions on supply, said Novak, who also noted that the market may be “in a small deficit, but overall stable.”Saudi Arabia—which holds the world’s largest spare oil production capacity—said that it would boost oil production over the next three months because it expects demand to be stronger.The Saudis claim that their spare production capacity is between 1.5 million bpd and 2 million bpd. The problem with this estimate is that it has never been tested.Saudi Arabia’s all-time high oil production is 10.72 million bpd, achieved in November 2016 just before the OPEC+ deal entered into force. In August 2018, the Saudis pumped 10.4 million bpd, as per OPEC secondary sources data.The EIA defines spare capacity as the volume of oil production that can be brought online within 30 days and sustained for at least 90 days.  Related: What Will Trigger The Next Oil Price Crash?According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates, OPEC countries have a combined 2.7 million bpd of spare production capacity, of which 60 percent is in Saudi Arabia.“But the point about spare capacity is that, having been idle, it is not clear exactly how much, beyond what is widely thought to be ‘easy’ to bring online, will be available to coincide with further falls in Venezuelan exports and a maximisation of Iranian sanctions,” the IEA said in its latest monthly Oil Market Report.The market is tightening, and it’s expected to further tighten by the end of the year thanks to Iran and Venezuela, but OPEC and Russia are not rushing to tap into spare capacity, because leaving it tight could raise the risk of a spike in oil prices in case of another outage somewhere.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/OPECs-No4-Vows-To-Boost-Spare-Oil-Capacity.html,"Sep 25, 2018 at 16:28 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Sep 25, 2018",OPEC's No.4 Vows To Boost Spare Oil Capacity
2018-09-25,"The past four years have been a 21st century low point for Western foreign investment in Russia, with sanctions, unlawful trade practices and ceaseless wars in the Greater Middle East antagonizing the sides even further. Against such a difficult background when virtually no Western major brave enough to enter the Russian market (and most American firms rolling back projects) it is doubly notable what Schlumberger is doing. In fact, Schlumberger seems to be, one might say finally, on the brink of concluding a milestone Russia deal, which would greatly fortify its standing as the world’s leading oil services company. By buying into Russia’s largest onshore drilling firm Eurasia Drilling Company (EDC), it could secure access to a massive market irrespective of political tensions. Well, almost irrespective.The news that Schlumberger is allegedly keen on acquiring EDC first emerged in early 2015. Even then, several months after the introduction of a US-EU ban on any Western participation in Arctic, deep-water or shale projects, it raised eyebrows as an excessively ambitious undertaking. Schlumberger initially wanted to gain immediate and full control over EDC’s equity, then agreed to a first-round buy-out of 51% and in the end somewhat grudgingly acquiesced to offer $1.7 billion for 46% (because Russian authorities were concerned about the potential loss of an influential element of the nation’s oil sector) to be followed by a second-round acquisition three years later of the remaining 54%. Confronted with massive bureaucratic pushback, Schlumberger renounced on the idea, pledging to look for M&A possibilities elsewhere… only to come around with a new offer two years later.The fact that it is Schlumberger, not some other service major, that is buying Russia’s leading oil services company is by no means accidental. The co-owner of EDC, Alexander Dzhaparidze (neither he, nor the other owner Alexandr Putilov are under sanctions) has sold his first oil services-related company, the Iraq-focused Petroalliance, to Schlumberger in 2003. Partially on the money generated by the sale, Dzhaparidze bought drilling assets then-owned by the private major LUKOIL, thus kick-starting the development of EDC. Since then, EDC and Schlumberger have forged a sort of a strategic alliance in 2011, with several cross-acquisition of each other’s Russian assets in the years leading up to the acquisition negotiations.  Related: Here’s What’s Next For Russian LNGgoogletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();Since 2015, however, a whole slew of things has changed. The United States have levied their umpteenth round of sanctions against Russia and very few are those who still believe that bilateral relations can be mended anytime soon. Illustrating the depth of the schism, the Russian government is openly saying that the populace should brace itself for years, if not decades of US-led sanctions. Eurasia Drilling has changed, too, following the failure of the first Schlumberger bid – in late 2015 the top management effectuated a take-private deal and shortly after going private EDC has delisted its shares from the London Stock Exchange. Against the background of rising oil prices, a genuine feeling of cautious optimism in the global markets and (even) Russia’s GDP bouncing back into growth in 2017, Schlumberger launched another bid in July 2017.Whilst the oil market managed to test the bottom and rebound back into almost universally palatable levels within less than three years, there has been little change in the stance of Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Office (FAS) – it is comfortable with Schlumberger taking anything within the 25%+1 share – 49% interval. FAS authorities even recommended Schlumberger to launch a joint bid with Russia’s Direct Investment Fund or a UAE fund. This is a highly unlikely scenario, as letting in the Russian government would definitely not serve EDC’s aim to derisk its activities. Especially so as a powerful state-owned company, the oil giant Rosneft, seemed very eager to immerse EDC in the past. Despite Rosneft’s statements to the contrary, there is no guarantee that it will not give it another go once its debt burden eases.  Related: Why Peak Oil Demand Doesn’t MatterAll in all, EDC is interested in Schlumberger as a buyer, Schlumberger is interested in EDC to provide a big boost to its Russia presence (statistics differ on EDC’s market share, however, generally it is located within the 20%-30% interval). Against such a constellation, a deal of some sorts ought to emerge at one point and despite sporadic antics from Russian authorities there have been encouraging signs in the past few weeks, pointing towards such a mutually acceptable solution. Odd as it may seem, the latest presumed deal setup reflects the geopolitical conditions between Russia and the United States. As it stands, the Russian government is conditioning the deal with Schlumberger on the US firm granting its rights on a part of its technologies to a Russian entity in case it decides to leave the country spurred by further US sanctions.It should be noted that the list of specific technologies to be retained is still a matter of negotiations, so there is still work to be done on the EDC saga. Schlumberger also agreed to relocate EDC, which is currently a Cayman Islands-based company, to Russia, also preliminarily agreeing to the state’s local content requirements with regard to EDC’s equipment and component procurement. Schlumberger’s readiness to accept the sanctions clause might be the missing piece to the puzzle. If the deal goes forward for once (a separate US Treasury approval is also required), it will be the biggest Russian oil investment in the sanctions’ era, a timely and poignant reminder that sometimes the oil community is better off without politicization.By Viktor Katona for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Schlumberger-To-Buy-Russias-Leading-Drilling-Company.html,"Sep 25, 2018 at 11:27 | Viktor Katona","Sep 25, 2018",Schlumberger To Buy Russia's Leading Drilling Company
2018-09-25,"With U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports just six weeks away, at least ten Iranian oil supertankers have gone dark, not having broadcast any signal for at least a week, tanker tracking data compiled by Bloomberg shows, suggesting that Tehran may have resurrected the old unconventional tactic to conceal its crude oil shipments by switching off transponders on board.If Iran is deploying this tactic, tanker tracking data of Iranian oil exports may become less and less reliable as the starting date for the U.S. sanctions on Tehran’s oil approaches. Satellites and shore stations haven’t received any signals from the ten very large crude carriers (VLCC), each capable of transporting up to 2 million barrels of oil, for at least seven days, according to Bloomberg data. According to the tanker-tracking data, seven of those vessels, when last seen, were carrying a total of 13 million barrels of crude oil and condensate, the ultra-light oil that Iran pumps from its natural gas fields. The last known location of most of the tankers is in the Persian Gulf.According to Bloomberg, while the loss of signals from tankers can be attributed to seasonal weather conditions, disruptions from atmospheric conditions are typically much shorter. Once the tankers leave the Persian Gulf, they should have shown on satellite tracking systems if they have their tracking systems switched on.  Related: Iran Starts Air Force Drills Near The World’s Crucial Oil ChokepointAnalysts are facing two major headwinds in their estimation of how low Iranian oil exports could sink. One is how much of Iran’s oil China, India, and Europe will buy in October and then in November, when the sanctions kick in. The other is the concern that tanker tracking data may become increasingly unreliable as Iran could use ‘unconventional’ methods of keeping its oil sales on track, like switching off tracking devices on tankers—a method that Tehran is said to have used in the previous round of sanctions in 2012-2015.Analysts have started to assume that the U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil may remove more than 1 million bpd from the oil market. Earlier estimates were of around 500,000 bpd loss from Iran, but this was before the U.S. started to signal that waivers would be given sparingly, if at all, and that Washington expects all nations to cut off oil trade with Iran or risk secondary sanctions.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Has-Iran-Started-To-Switch-Off-Oil-Tanker-Tracking-Systems.html,"Sep 25, 2018 at 10:39 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Sep 25, 2018",Has Iran Started To Switch Off Oil Tanker Tracking Systems?
2018-09-25,"A squeeze on oil demand is looming as a result of the U.S.-China trade war, a senior BP executive told Reuters. Acknowledging the bullish effect of U.S. sanctions on Iran in the short term, Janet Kong, BP’s chief executive of oil trading operations in Asia, said this effect will be short-lived as the market absorbs the shock and moves on to other concerns.“Going into 2019, I worry about the impact of the U.S.-China trade war, manifesting itself slowly,” the executive said. “The trade war impact has not really shown up in the data anywhere, but it will show up gradually over time. So the supply shock is very sharp and prompt, while the impact from trade war is boiling over slowly.”There have been voices warning that the trade war will affect oil demand as it affects economic growth in China, but official oil demand forecasts have yet to factor it in, it seems. OPEC’s latest Monthly Oil Market Report, however, did revise the cartel’s forecasts for oil demand in 2019 down by 20,000 bpd to 1.41 million bpd, warning that global economic growth may slow.googletag.pubads().definePassback('36736787/sc_large_test', [[1,1]]).display();The International Energy Agency, on the other hand, has kept its 2019 demand forecast unchanged in the latest fundamentals update, at 1.5 million bpd, up from this year’s projected 1.4 million bpd. Yet the agency noted that demand could be stronger were it not for the trade war and signs of stalling economic growth in emerging economies.  Related: $100 Oil Is A Distinct PossibilityWhile general economic growth patterns are dependent on a host of different factors, the U.S.-China trade war is outside the normal course of events and, according to Kong, likely to drag on for quite a while, which would extend the duration of its negative effect on oil prices.“The Trump administration wants intellectual property protection,” Kong said. “... reducing subsidies to Chinese SOEs (state-owned enterprises) and open market access by all businesses which are difficult, in my view, for the Chinese government to agree to.
