2018-05-28,"HONOLULU (Reuters) - A lava flow from Hawaii’s erupting Kilauea volcano that damaged a geothermal power station has stalled, as have lava fountains gushing 100 feet (30 meters) into the air, offering momentary relief to an area under siege for 25 days, officials said on Monday. Even so, new blasts from the crater sent ash plumes billowing as high as 13,000 feet (4,000 meters) into the sky, and a new fissure was pumping out lava at a rate of three feet (1 metre) per second, geologists said. The new fissure sent more lava into the to evacuated Leilani Estates district in the eastern corner of Hawaii’s Big Island. Because the lava was spread out over a wide area, the frontier of the flow was only moving at about three feet per second, Carolyn Parcheta, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said in a video message posted online. Lava engulfed the heads of two wells that tap into steam and gas deep in the Earth’s core at the 38-megawatt Puna Geothermal Venture on Saturday. Its operator, Israeli-controlled Ormat Technologies Inc, said it had not been able to assess the damage. Residents fear the wells may be explosive. Officials have said the power plant is safe but lava has never engulfed a geothermal plant anywhere in the world, leaving a measure of uncertainty. The lava flow at PGV stalled on Monday, Hawaii County spokeswoman Janet Snyder said. Ormat said the plant represented about 4.5 percent of its total generating capacity and that major damage or a shutdown could have an “adverse impact” on the company’s business. Authorities have shut down the plant, removed 60,000 gallons (230,000 litres) of flammable liquid, and deactivated the wells. At least 82 homes have been destroyed in the southeast corner of Big Island and about 2,000 people have been ordered evacuated since Kilauea began erupting on May 3. About 2,200 acres (890 hectares) have been scorched and the eruptions are expected to cut tourism revenues. The sole reported serious injury from the eruption so far came when a man was hit by flying lava.  An eruption from the summit’s Halemaumau crater on Monday sent ash almost 15,000 feet (4,600 m) into the air, a National Weather Service meteorologist said. Hawaii County officials later cut the estimated height to 13,000 feet. Magma has drained from Kilauea’s summit lava lake and flowed around 25 miles (40 km) east underground, bursting out of about two dozen giant cracks or fissures.

2018-05-28,"SAO PAULO, May 28 (Reuters) - Brazilian sugar mills and sugarcane suppliers in São Paulo state are expected to halt production due to protests by truckers against high fuel prices that have blocked major highways across the country. Sugarcane industry group UNICA predicted on Monday that all mills in the key sugar production state of São Paulo would grind to a halt in 24 hours because the effects of the truckers’ protest were continuing, even though a truckers’ association said that it had told drivers to return to work. The government agreed on Sunday to cut taxes and offer subsidies to reduce diesel prices at the pump. The situation will affect São Paulo’s 150 mills and 14,000 sugarcane suppliers, UNICA said. About 60 percent of Brazil’s ethanol and sugar is produced in the state. “The scenario is worrying,” UNICA said in a statement, noting that mills will face a rise in costs as a result of the stoppage. It estimates the stalled businesses will lose a total 180 million reais ($48 million) in sales per day. Overall, Brazil’s center-south, the world’s largest sugarcane belt, will reduce crushing by 25 percent, or 10.9 million tonnes, in the second half of May, consultancy INTL FCStone said on Monday, because of the effects of the truckers’ protests. The number of mills halted in Brazil’s center-south, which includes São Paulo, could rise from 220 on Monday to 340 by Thursday if the protests continue, said trade group Fórum Nacional Sucroenergético. The situation adds to the woes of domestic biofuel and sugar companies that in recent years have grappled with high debt, highly-regulated fuel markets and lower prices. The truck protest caused gas stations and airports to run out of fuel, while supermarket shelves went bare and hospitals said they were running out of supplies. Companies and farmers in Brazil, a major exporter of staple commodities like sugar, soy and meat, were also unable to deliver goods to ports for export due to the road blocks. UNICA also said some mills had their sugarcane fields set on fire during the protests. The mills were targeted after trying to deliver ethanol to guarantee minimum supplies to the population, UNICA said. “The fires will mean an additional loss of revenue,” UNICA said.

2018-05-28,"BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Petrobras shares plunged 15 percent on Monday after Brazil’s government offered new fuel subsidies and softened the oil producer’s pricing policy in a bid to settle a truckers’ strike that has wreaked havoc on Latin America’s largest economy. As a result of tax cuts and subsidies announced by President Michel Temer late on Sunday, domestic diesel prices would fall 0.46 real per litre, or about 13 percent of the current price at the pump, and remain frozen for 60 days.  Shareholders in state-controlled Petróleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA), which earlier this month soared after the company reported its highest profits in five years, have been hammered as the stock lost nearly a third of its value in the past week. Compounding the sense of crisis, Petrobras management sent a letter to its workers urging them not to follow through on a strike planned for later in the week, saying “paralysis and pressure for adjusting prices” would hurt the company or country as a whole. Under the deal announced by Temer, after the initial 60-day period price freeze, Petrobras will start adjusting diesel prices monthly, a switch from its current policy of daily price changes. Petrobras said in a securities filing that the government had agreed to compensate it for any losses. But investors were sceptical.  Since May 18, when speculation began that the government might need to negotiate with truckers over diesel prices, Petrobras has lost 127.5 billion reais (25.65 billion pounds) in market value. Its drop on Monday led a broader sell-off in Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index .BVSP, which slumped 4.5 percent and is now in negative territory for the year. The latest pricing announcement “suggests increasing risk that the government will interfere in Petrobras affairs again or force them to subsidise the domestic market again,” said Morningstar analyst Allen Good, adding it was “a change in the market-friendly policy implemented in the last couple of years.”  For years, Petrobras subsidized domestic fuel prices, boosting its debt load, a policy current Chief Executive Pedro Parente - whose days some investors fear may be numbered - has tried to reverse. “There were rumours last week Parente might resign,” Good said. “The latest decisions might force his hand.” Petrobras has denied the rumours, saying Parente has no intention of quitting. The subsidy and tax cut measures represented Temer’s latest concessions to the truckers, whose strike has won popular support even as it has severely hampered the flow of food, fuel and key exports in Latin America’s largest economy. A truckers’ association behind the nationwide protest has told drivers to get back to work, but the government said progress had been slow and highway police said 556 highway blockades by protesters remained in place. The moves also left Temer’s government scrambling to win congressional approval for several tax measures needed to avoid breaking budget rules, a daunting endeavour ahead of October’s congressional and presidential elections. Brazilian farm groups, meanwhile, warned that production and exports of key commodities like coffee and soy would fall if the truckers continue to block roads. [nE6N1SV00B] Some 64 million chickens have starved to death as a result of the strike, meat group ABPA said on Sunday. Brazil is the world’s largest chicken exporter. As many as 150 poultry and pork processing plants have stopped production for lack of feed and storage space, the association said.  Among other sectors, Brazilian steelmakers like Cia Siderurgica Nacional (CSNA3.SA) and Usiminas (USIM5.SA) may lose up to 20 percent of their revenue in May due to the strike, analysts from XP Investimentos said in a research note.  Shares in food retailers Carrefour Brasil (CARR.PA) and GPA SA (PCAR4.SA) also fell as analysts warned their supply chains would suffer.

2018-05-28,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A nationwide protest by Brazilian truckers was slow to unwind on Monday, even after the week-long demonstrations against diesel price hikes got the government to cave to their demands, causing stocks and the currency to slide. Brazilian truckers association Abcam, which says it represents at least 600,000 independent truck drivers, called on members to stand down, but warned that unwinding protests would take time. “We are working to spread the word of a deal to all the drivers,” Abcam said in a written statement. “It is worth remembering that even though we are calling for an end to the blockades, not all protesters agree with that.” By Monday night, most of the country had not returned to any semblance of normality.  The truckers’ protest left South America’s biggest city and economic hub Sao Paulo, and hundreds of communities across the country, without fuel, emptying normally gridlocked roads. Hospitals said they were running out of supplies.  Schools cancelled classes, businesses told employees to work from home and virtually every part of the powerhouse agribusiness sector said the damage was massive, if not yet quantifiable. In a televised Sunday night address, President Michel Temer said he signed three decrees with immediate effect to address the main demands of truck drivers, adding that “we gave everything they asked for.”  One of the decrees cuts the price of diesel at the pump by 12 percent for 60 days, another ordered toll operators across the country not to charge for rear axles that are not in use and another mandates the minimum fare paid to truckers for freight.  Finance Minister Eduardo Guardia said on Monday that the measures Temer announced will cost 9.5 billion reais (1.91 billion pounds), of which 3.8 billion will come from cutting government expenses.     The benchmark Bovespa stock index .BVSP dropped 4.5 percent, sliding into negative territory for the first time this year. Leading the losses was a nearly 15 percent plunge by Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA) due to investor concerns about political interference in the state-led oil company's fuel pricing policy. Brazil’s currency also lost about 1.6 percent on Monday against the U.S. dollar on concerns about further pressure on the government’s gaping fiscal deficit.  “The market is focused on the fiscal problem, with the impact the government’s actions will have on public accounts,” said Fernando Bergallo, head of currency at FB Capital. Guardia acknowledged that the truckers’ protests would have a “relevant” impact on this year’s gross domestic product.  In the central bank’s weekly survey released Monday, economists polled revised their economic growth forecasts to 2.37 percent growth in 2018, down from a median forecast of 2.5 percent the week before. In a sign of the uncertainty of how or when the protest may wind down, one of the leaders of independent truckers in Rio de Janeiro, Vicente Reis, said that drivers were not happy with what Temer offered. “We are not satisfied with what was offered, nor even with who was negotiating,” Reis said. “Our goal is no longer just a cut in diesel prices. We won the support of society and now we want a reduction in the costs of other fuels.” Reporting by Raquel Stenzel, Alberto Alerigi, Camila Moreira, Tatiana Bautzer and Claudia Violante in Sao Paulo; Marcela Ayres, Lisandra Paraguassu and Bruno Federowski in Brasilia; and Rodrigo Viga Gaier in Rio de Janeiro; Writing by Brad Brooks; Editing by James Dalgleish and Diane Craft",https://uk.reuters.com/article/brazil-transport-protests/update-2-brazil-truckers-slow-to-end-strike-despite-concessions-idUKL2N1SZ0JS,28 May 2018,"A nationwide protest by

2018-05-28,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia headed for its most divisive presidential race in decades after right-winger Ivan Duque won Sunday’s first-round vote, triggering a runoff with leftist Gustavo Petro that could upset a historic peace deal or see a reversal in business-friendly policies. It is the first time in Colombia’s modern history that an openly leftist candidate has reached the second round of a presidential vote, a prospect that has unnerved some investors in Latin America’s fourth largest economy. Duque, a 41-year-old former official of the Washington-based InterAmerican Development Bank, was the convincing winner of Sunday’s ballot with 39 percent of votes, ahead of Petro, an outspoken ex-mayor of Bogota, with 25 percent, broadly in line with polls. However, Duque’s pledge to overhaul the 2016 peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) by scrapping immunity for those convicted of crimes has alarmed many Colombians, weary after five decades of conflict that killed more than 200,000 people and left 7 million others displaced. Though outgoing President Juan Manuel Santos won the Nobel Peace Prize for forging the accord, it has deeply divided the nation of around 50 million people. The deal was narrowly rejected in a referendum before Congress finally approved a modified version. Petro, himself a former member of the now defunct M-19 rebel group, has backed the peace agreement, along with the three other losing candidates, meaning Duque may need to moderate his position to attract wavering voters in the June 17 second round. “We don’t want to shatter the agreement. We want to make it clear that a Colombia of peace is a Colombia where peace meets justice,” Duque said in a victory speech on Sunday to cheering supporters, in which he complimented third-place finisher Sergio Fajardo and said their social agendas had much in common. Fajardo, a centre-left mathematician who won 24 percent of the vote, has declined to endorse either candidate for the second round, saying his supporters would make up their own minds.  “It would be disrespectful to say I am the owner of the votes,” Fajardo told Blu Radio on Monday, adding that he would meet with his team to discuss options.  All recent polls have predicted that Duque would beat Petro in a second round, and that Fajardo was the only candidate who could have posed a risk to the conservative frontrunner if he had made it through. However, some political analysts in Colombia said that the votes of the centre-left could be enough for Petro to at least mount a serious challenge to Duque, provided he can dodge his rival’s accusations of radicalism.  “Petro was quite clearly behind Duque in the vote so that will reassure the markets,” said Camilo Perez, head of economic studies at Banco de Bogota. “But the fact that Fajardo was so close to Petro may generate nervousness, as his approach is probably closer to Petro’s and that could send votes (Petro’s) way.”  However, Petro’s more hardline rhetoric could also put off centre-left voters, said Citigroup analyst Munir Jalil.  Colombia's COLCAP stock index .COLCAP was down 0.65 percent, with many investors assuming the election was Duque's to lose. The yield on the local Treasury bond maturing July 2024 slipped to 6.044 from 6.071 on Friday, while trade in the peso currency COP=STFX was closed for the U.S. Memorial Day holiday.     The winner of the second round will face an intimidating array of challenges, from stubbornly low economic growth to threats to Colombia’s prized investment grade credit rating, as well as difficulties in implementing the peace accord.    Some areas abandoned by the FARC have suffered an increase in fighting between criminal gangs and a remaining guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army (ELN), over valuable illegal mining and drug trafficking territories.  Polls suggest the end of the FARC conflict has shifted voters’ priorities to inequality and corruption from security issues, opening the door to the left for the first time. However, a growing crisis in neighbouring socialist-run Venezuela, which has driven hundreds of thousands of desperate people across the border, is a thorn in Petro’s side. Duque’s camp allege he would plunge Colombia into a similar crisis. While Duque has pledged to cut taxes and support private enterprise, Petro has promised to take power away from the political and social elites he accuses of stymieing development. At his election night party in the capital, Petro struck a moderate tone, though, as both he and Duque seek to attract centrist voters. “When we talk about defeating poverty, we’re not talking about impoverishing the rich, but about enriching the poor,” said the bespectacled Petro, surrounded by family members. In a country where oil and coal are the top export earners, Petro’s pledges to end extractive industries have dismayed business leaders and centrists. “Our country has never lived such a polarized moment as this and Petro represents a huge danger,” Mariana Riaño, a 21-year-old student, said at Duque’s celebration party at a conference centre in Bogota. “But we are going to beat him.”  Graphic tmsnrt.rs/2rAQ4l1 on Latin American elections Reporting by Helen Murphy, Luis Jaime Acosta, Nelson Bocanegra and Steven Grattan; Additional reporting by Dylan Baddour; Writing by Daniel Flynn; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Rosalba O'Brien",https://uk.reuters.com/article/colombia-election/update-4-colombia-heads-for-divisive-runoff-with-peace-deal-at-stake-idUKL2N1SZ0CD,28 May 2018,"Colombia headed for its most

2018-05-28,"LONDON, May 28 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - More than three million cases of dengue fever, the world’s fastest-spreading tropical disease, could be avoided annually if global warming is capped at 1.5C, said a study that purports to be the first to show the health benefits of a cooler planet. The mosquito-borne viral infection causes flu-like symptoms and can be fatal if it develops into severe haemorrhagic form. The annual number of cases has increased 30-fold in the last 50 years, says the World Health Organization (WHO). Using computer models, researchers from the University of East Anglia in Britain found that capping warming at 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) could cut annual dengue cases in Latin America and the Caribbean by up to 2.8 million by the end of the century. A further half a million cases could be prevented if the rise in global temperatures is kept down to 1.5C, the report said, with parts of South America most likely to benefit. “There is growing concern about the potential impacts of climate change on human health,” said lead author Felipe Colón-González. “This is the first study to show that reductions in warming from 2C to 1.5C could have important health benefits.” Since the year 2000, climate change has caused severe harm to human health by stoking more heatwaves, the spread of some mosquito-borne diseases and under-nutrition as crops fail, according to a Lancet report last October. Current national pledges to curb emissions put the world on track for a warming of about 3C above pre-industrial times, far above the goal of “well below” 2C set at a 2015 summit in Paris. The WHO has previously estimated there could be 250,000 extra deaths a year between 2030 and 2050 because of climate change. “Understanding and quantifying the impacts of warming on human health is crucial for public health preparedness and response,” said co-author Iain Lake in a statement. “Clearly a lot more needs to be done to reduce (carbon dioxide) and quickly if we are to avoid these impacts,” he said. Dengue infects around 390 million people worldwide each year, with an estimated 54 million cases in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). There is no cure for dengue and medical experts recommend early detection and expert care as the most effective way of overcoming an infection.

2018-05-28,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices extended losses on Monday as Saudi Arabia and Russia said they may increase supplies while U.S. production gains showed no sign of slowing.  Brent crude futures LCOc1 stood at $75.32 a barrel at 1805 GMT, down $1.12 from the previous close. The contract touched a three-week low of $74.49 earlier in the session.  U.S. crude futures were at $66.47, down $1.41, after hitting a six-week low of $65.80. The spread between the two contracts CL-LCO1=R reached $9.38 a barrel, its widest since March 2015.  Trading was light due to public holidays in the United States and United Kingdom. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers led by Russia began withholding 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) of supplies in 2017 to tighten the market and prop up prices that in 2016 fell to their lowest in more than a decade at less than $30 a barrel.  Prices have soared since the start of the cuts last year, with Brent breaking through $80 this month, triggering concerns that high prices could crimp economic growth and stoke inflation. “The pace of the recent rise in oil prices has sparked a debate among investors on whether this poses downside risks to global growth,” Chetan Ahya, chief economist at U.S. bank Morgan Stanley, wrote in a weekend note.  To address potential supply shortfalls Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of OPEC, and top producer Russia have been in talks about easing the cuts and raising oil production by 1 million bpd, sources said last week. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Saturday that a return to October 2016 production levels, the baseline for the current supply pact, was one option for easing curbs. GRAPHIC: Asia's oil thirst is expensive - reut.rs/2wLchCf “Given that our crude balance is short some 825,000 bpd over (the second half of the year), a gradual increase of about 1 million bpd would probably limit stock draws to quite some extent,” Vienna-based consultancy JBC Energy said.  Meanwhile, surging U.S. crude production showed no sign of abating as drillers continued to expand their search for new oilfields to exploit.  U.S. energy companies added 15 rigs looking for new oil in the week ending May 25, bringing the rig count to 859, its highest since 2015, in a strong indication that American crude production will continue to rise. U.S. crude output C-OUT-T-EIA has already surged by more than 27 percent in the past two years, to 10.73 million bpd, ever closer to Russia’s 11 million bpd.

2018-05-28,"JOHANNESBURG, May 28 (Reuters) - South Africa’s Solidarity trade union can go on strike in a dispute with petrochemicals group Sasol over its plan to provide a share ownership scheme exclusively to black employees, a government mediator has ruled. South Africa has a state-mandated drive to lift black ownership levels across an economy still riddled with apartheid-era racial disparities. The ruling opens the way for white workers to down tools over the issue - a new flashpoint in a country riven with labour conflict. Solidarity, which represents mostly skilled and white workers, declared a dispute with the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) over Sasol’s plan to exclude white employees from its new share scheme. The commission found in a ruling last week but only made public on Monday that “there is nothing in law” that would prevent it from providing Solidarity with a strike certificate - needed for workers to down tools - over the issue. The two sides are still in talks being mediated by the CCMA. Solidarity represents about 5,300 employees at Sasol, about a fifth of its South African workforce. “What we argue is that all employees should be treated the same so that all employees who contributed to the success of the company receive the same amount and treatment,” Deon Reyneke, Deputy General Secretary at Solidarity, told Reuters. In a statement, Sasol said it was confident that the share ownership plan “incorporates what we consider to be the most appropriate and best features of Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment structures in South Africa.” (Reporting by Ed Stoddard Editing by Gareth Jones)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/safrica-sasol-union/union-may-strike-over-black-employees-share-plan-at-s-africas-sasol-state-mediator-idUKL5N1SZ3NW,28 May 2018,"South Africa's Solidarity

2018-05-28,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia is cancelling a project to build a high-speed rail link between its capital, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore, and will talk with its southern neighbour about any compensation Malaysia has to pay, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Monday. Mahathir, the 92-year-old who triumphed in a general election this month, has made it a priority to cut the national debt and pledged to review big projects agreed by his predecessor that he says are expensive and have no financial benefit.  “It is a final decision, but it will take time because we have an agreement with Singapore,” Mahathir told a news conference referring to his scrapping of the project, valued by analysts at about $17 billion. The project is out for tender and was scheduled to be completed by 2026. Mahathir said Malaysia may have to pay about 500 million ringgit ($125.63 million) to Singapore to get out of the deal. “We had agreed to proceed with the High Speed Rail project based on mutual benefits and obligations,” Singapore’s Ministry of Trade said in a statement.  “We will wait for official communication from Malaysia.”  Companies from China, Japan, South Korea and Europe were eyeing a contract to build, operate and finance the trains and the rail assets, sources close to the bidding process had told Reuters. Even picking a winner was expected to test ties between Malaysia and Singapore, which have been frosty since the end of the colonial era in the 1960s, against the backdrop of broader tension over China’s growing influence in the region. About 90 percent of the rail network was set to be in Malaysia, including a terminal in Bandar Malaysia, a big property development owned by scandal-hit state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). A $1.7 billion deal to sell a majority stake in Bandar Malaysia to a Malaysian-Chinese consortium fell through in May 2017. A year on, the project has failed to attract any buyers.  Mahathir has reopened an investigation into 1MDB following his election victory. It is being investigated in other countries, including the United States. Properties linked to former prime minister Najib Razak have been searched as part of the investigation, and Najib has given statements to an anti-graft agency. Najib has long denied any wrongdoing. Mahathir said his government was also in the process of renegotiating with Chinese partners over the terms of a $14 billion rail deal aimed at connecting the South China Sea at the Thai border in the east with the strategic shipping routes of the Straits of Malacca in the west. He estimates that Malaysia could cut almost a fifth of its $250 billion national debt and liabilities by scrapping such big projects. Reporting by Liz Lee, John Geddie and A.

2018-05-28,"(Adds expected 2018 biodiesel exports in 4th paragraph) BUENOS AIRES, May 28 (Reuters) - Argentina’s government is raising an export tax on biodiesel to 15 percent from 8 percent, effective July 1, according to a decree published in the official Gazette on Monday. Argentina is one of the world’s top providers of biodiesel fuel, exporting 1.65 million tonnes in 2017, but it has been hit by retaliatory tariffs in recent years. The U.S. International Trade Commision has added anti-dumping duties of 60.44 percent to 276.65 percent to already steep anti-subsidy duties on imported biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia. The CIARA-CEC exporters’ chamber told Reuters earlier this month it also expected the European Union to stop importing biodiesel by imposing new tariffs in September or October. The Chamber sees exports falling to around 700,000 tonnes this year. The decree, signed by President Mauricio Macri, is meant to “continue fostering convergence” between biodiesel export taxes and soy oil export taxes. The country is the world’s top supplier of soyoil used for cooking and making biodiesel. Local biofuels industry group Carbio declined comment on the new taxes. When Macri won office on a business-friendly platform in 2015, the soybean export tax stood at 35 percent. The tax started the year at 30 percent and is being cut by a half percentage point every month for two years. It currently stands at 27.5 percent while the tax on soy oil and soymeal exports stands at 25.5 percent.

2018-05-28,"(Corrects date applied from June 1 to July 1) BUENOS AIRES, May 28 (Reuters) - Argentina’s government is raising an export tax on biodiesel to 15 percent from 8 percent, effective July 1, according to a decree published in the official Gazette on Monday. Argentina is one of the world’s top providers of biodiesel fuel, exporting 1.65 million tonnes in 2017, but it has been hit by retaliatory tariffs in recent years. The U.S. International Trade Commision has added anti-dumping duties of 60.44 percent to 276.65 percent to already steep anti-subsidy duties on imported biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia. The CIARA-CEC exporters’ chamber told Reuters earlier this month it also expected the European Union to stop importing biodiesel by imposing new tariffs in September or October. The decree, signed by president Mauricio Macri, is meant to “continue fostering convergence” between biodiesel export taxes and soy oil export taxes. The country is the world’s top supplier of soyoil used for cooking and making biodiesel. Local biofuels industry group Carbio declined comment on the new taxes. When Macri won office on a business-friendly platform in 2015, the soybean export tax stood at 35 percent. The tax started the year at 30 percent and is being cut by a half percentage point every month for two years. It currently stands at 27.5 percent while the tax on soy oil and soymeal exports stands at 25.5 percent. Macri outright eliminated export taxes on corn and wheat soon after his inauguration in December 2015 - a boon for farmers but not for Argentina’s fiscal accounts.

2018-05-28,"BRASILIA, May 28 (Reuters) - Petrobras shares fell as much as 9 percent on Monday after Brazil’s government offered new fuel subsidies and changed the oil producer’s pricing policy in a bid to settle a truckers’ strike that has shuttered factories and caused food and fuel shortages. As a result of tax cuts and subsidies announced by President Michel Temer late on Sunday, domestic diesel prices would fall 0.46 real per liter and remain frozen at that level for 60 days. Yet to avoid breaking budget rules, the Brazilian congress would need to approve several tax measures, a daunting endeavor ahead of this year’s parliamentary and presidential elections. The measures represented Temer’s latest concessions to the truckers, whose strike has won popular support even as it has severely hampered the flow of food, fuel and key exports in Latin America’s largest economy. After the initial 60-day period price freeze, state-controlled Petróleo Brasileiro SA will start adjusting diesel prices monthly, a switch from its current policy of daily price changes. Should global diesel prices fall in coming months, the government could choose to trim subsidies, Finance Minister Eduardo Guardia said. Petrobras said in a securities filing that the government had agreed to compensate it for any losses. Still, its shares plunged to a four-month low. For years, Petrobras subsidized domestic fuel prices, boosting its debt load - a policy current Chief Executive Pedro Parente has tried to reverse - contributing to the diesel price hikes that triggered the truckers’ rebellion. Renewed worries about Petrobras’ independence from political inference have shaved 113 billion reais off its market capitalization since the truckers’ strike began a week ago. To partially offset the subsidies’ cost, which could reach as much as 9.5 billion reais ($2.6 billion) this year, and avoid missing its 2018 budget goal, Guardia said the government would cut spending by 3.8 billion reais. It will also have to hike taxes to offset an additional 4-billion real loss from diesel tax cuts to avoid breaking budget rules. That would be partially paid for by an increase in payroll taxes that has struggled to win congressional approval for months, but would also require further tax measures that the government will unveil once that plan is passed, Guardia said. Guardia also said the government will implement a variable tax on diesel imports that will kick in whenever global prices fall below local benchmark prices, protecting Petrobras’ competitiveness. Newspaper Valor Econômico had reported on Monday that Petrobras had proposed such a plan. $1 = 3.71 reais

2018-05-28,"BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany’s Transport Ministry quizzed Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche on Monday over how many Mercedes-Benz vans and cars need to be fixed after a regulator said it had found illegal software in one of its models. The luxury carmaker was summoned to a closed-door meeting to answer questions about software devices found in Mercedes-Benz vans by Germany’s KBA motor vehicle authority. Daimler was last week ordered by KBA to recall Vito vans fitted with 1.6 litre diesel engines because it said they breached emissions rules. Daimler has said it will appeal against KBA’s decision to classify the software as illegal and contest its findings in court if necessary, although it said it was cooperating fully. German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer said Daimler had been given until June 15 to come up with a solution to the Vito delivery van’s emissions issues following “an in-depth exchange about highly complex technical questions”. “At a further meeting in 14 days, concrete results will be on the table,” Scheuer added in a statement. Asked how the meeting went, Zetsche told Reuters: “It was a good discussion. We will see each other again in 14 days.” Global carmakers are facing a regulatory clamp-down since Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted to deliberately cheating diesel emissions tests in 2015. Regulators are now focussing on narrowing the gap between pollution levels “on the road” when compared to exhaust emissions measured during testing. Germany’s Transport Ministry said the Vito had been equipped with a software device which manipulated the an emissions filtering system which relies on injecting a urea-based liquid to help neutralise nitrogen oxide emissions in exhaust fumes. Some Mercedes-Benz models, including the Vito, use diesel engines supplied by Daimler’s partner Renault. French prosecutors opened a probe into Renault in January 2017 after the country’s consumer watchdog DGCCRF found engine software deactivated anti-pollution functions. Daimler has previously said Mercedes vehicles being scrutinised by KBA were fitted with a Renault supplied OM622 engine, which had been used in around 1,000 Mercedes-Benz Vito tourer models in Germany.  Under European rules, carmakers rather than suppliers are responsible for the legality of road certification of each model they sell, even if engines and software were supplied by third party.   Daimler and Robert Bosch, which supplies engine management systems, are both being investigated by criminal prosecutors in Stuttgart.  Asked whether French prosecutors were being briefed as part of the Mercedes probe, the Stuttgart prosecutor’s office said only that it was in touch with foreign authorities. Renault declined to comment. Daimler said on Monday that no diesel engines supplied by Renault were used in Mercedes-Benz vehicles sold in the United States, where the discovery of illegal software devices carries far higher penalties than in Europe. European rules on using software to manage exhaust emissions filtering systems are more lax than in the United States, allowing carmakers greater leeway to switch off exhaust filtering systems if “engine damage” can be reduced as a result.   German newspaper Bild am Sonntag, without citing sources, said regulators are probing around 40,000 Mercedes-Benz Vito vans and 80,000 C-Class models for possible software that allowed them to emit excess pollution without detection. European carmakers had invested heavily in diesel engines, which produce less carbon dioxide but more of other pollutants blamed for causing respiratory disease than petrol engines. However, German cities are now entitled to ban older diesel vehicles from streets to bring air pollution levels in line with European Union rules.

Under the proposal, single-use plastic products with readily available alternatives will be banned and replaced with more environmentally sustainable materials.  The proposal also requires EU countries to collect 90 percent of single-use plastic drink bottles by 2025 and producers to help cover costs of waste management and clean-up.  “Plastic waste is undeniably a big issue and Europeans need to act together to tackle this problem, because plastic waste ends up in our air, our soil, our oceans, and in our food,” said EU Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans. Plastic accumulating in the world’s oceans has become a major policy issue for governments, with scientists warning of their effect on the food chain. Research published in the online journal Scientific Reports estimates a garbage patch of some 79,000 metric tonnes - 1.8 trillion pieces - of plastic has formed in the Pacific Ocean, mainly consisting of fishing nets, plastic containers, packaging and ropes.  Earlier this year, Britain also said it planned to ban the sale of plastic straws and other single-use products. The Commission proposal will still need to be approved by the European Parliament and Council, and the Commission said it hoped for it to be given the green light before the European elections in May 2019.

2018-05-28,"DILI, May 28 (Reuters) - An East Timor opposition coalition, including a party led by independence hero Xanana Gusmao, won a majority of the seats in parliament in an election this month, a court said on Monday. The vote was called in a bid to end months of deadlock in the tiny Southeast Asian country’s  parliament, where there had been a minority government led by Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri. The Alliance of Change for Progress (AMP) won 49.6 percent of the votes, said Deolindo dos Santos, head of East Timor’s Court of Appeal. The AMP, a coalition of Gusmao’s National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction (CNRT) and two other parties, secured 34 of the 65 seats in parliament. The Fretilin party of outgoing Prime Minister Alkatiri won 34.2 percent of votes. The party had protested about alleged irregularities during the vote, but the appeal court rejected the complaint. Fidelis Magalhaes, an official from the AMP coalition, said the result should break the deadlock in parliament. “East Timor must have a government that stands and comes from an absolute majority in parliament,” Magalhaes said by telephone. He declined to comment on speculation that former president and prime minister Gusmao would stand again as prime minister. Gusmao could not be reached for comment. The election campaign was marred by sporadic violence, though East Timor has been largely peaceful in recent years following recurrent bouts of political instability that it suffered since independence from Indonesia in 2002. A 2017 parliamentary election produced no clear winner, with the Fretilin party winning just 0.2 percent more votes than CNRT, and forming a minority government. East Timor President Francisco “Lu Olo” Guterres dissolved parliament in January and called for fresh elections, the fifth parliamentary election since independence. Asia’s youngest democracy has struggled to alleviate poverty, stamp out corruption and develop its rich oil and gas resources. The energy sector accounted for about 60 percent of gross domestic product in 2014 and more than 90 percent of government revenue. Candidates in the election had campaigned on promises to develop education and healthcare and boost agriculture and tourism in the country of 1.2 million people with a land area slightly smaller than Hawaii.

2018-05-28," LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - The slack period for liquefied natural gas (LNG) in top consumer Asia is usually the shoulder season between winter and summer, or March to May, but this pattern hasn’t really repeated this year. The spot price of the super-chilled fuel in Asia has been on a rising trend since the beginning of April, and hit $9.20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at the end of last week. It touched its low for 2018 of $7 per mmBtu in the week ended March 29, remained unchanged the next week and then posted gains in six of the seven weeks since. Last year, the shoulder season low of $5.40 per mmBtu was first reached in late March, and the price drifted in a narrow band until early July, when it started climbing from $5.45 in the week to July 7, 2017. In 2016, the low was hit in early April before a mild rally for the northern summer, and then another dip in the autumn shoulder season before strong gains in the winter period. What appears to be different so far this year is that while seasonal price fluctuations are still evident, the dip was shallower than in previous years and the rally from the low looks sharper so far. Spot LNG fell 39 percent from its peak of $11.50 per mmBtu for the winter of 2018 to the low in late March, while in 2017 the slump from winter peak to shoulder season low was 45 percent, and it was 49 percent the prior year. So far LNG has rallied 31 percent from the low, in the space of eight weeks. In 2017, eight weeks after reaching the low, LNG had gained just 12 percent, while the increase was 26 percent in 2016. (For a graphic showing China LNG imports vs. spot price, click here: reut.rs/2Jam75C) What the numbers show is that while seasonality is still in place, the price lows aren’t as deep as in previous years and the rally from that low appears to be on track to be steeper and higher. The easy explanation for this dynamic is China, which has continued to buy LNG at a frantic pace this year, after the 46.4 percent jump in imports in 2017 to a total of 38.1 million tonnes, making it the world’s second-biggest buyer behind Japan. China’s LNG imports rose 58 percent to 15.8 million tonnes in the first four months of this year compared to the same period a year earlier, according to customs data. This would put it on target for imports of more than 47 million tonnes for the full year, but this is likely to be a conservative estimate, given LNG buying tend to ramp up in the months ahead of the peak winter demand period. But it’s not just China that is sucking up more LNG, with South Korea making a bid to reclaim its former place as the world’s second-biggest importer. In the first four months of the year South Korea brought in 16.2 million tonnes of LNG, up 18.2 percent from the same period last year, according customs data. Even top importer Japan is buying modestly more LNG, with imports in the first quarter up 1.1 percent from the same period in 2017, a faster pace of growth than the 0.4 percent for the whole of 2017.

In the first five months of 2018, a total of 125.1 million tonnes of LNG has been discharged, a figure that may rise to closer to 133 million by the end of this month as more vessels are unloaded. This would be some 14 million tonnes, or almost 12 percent, more than the 118.9 million tonnes discharged in the first five months of last year.

2018-05-28,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Many Britons will have their daily milk delivered by German vans after Deutsche Post won a contract to deliver 200 electric trucks to doorstep delivery service Milk & More. Electric milk floats, as they are known in Britain, have been a part of daily life for generations, with milkmen delivering glass bottles to people’s homes every morning. The service has recently regained popularity as public concerns over pollution caused by plastic containers has risen. Milk & More said the Deutsche Post StreetScooter order aimed to keep milk deliveries quiet and environmentally friendly. But it could face political noise as since Britain’s vote to leave the European Union there has been increased scrutiny of such deals amid concerns that British firms are losing out. Some politicians were critical when Franco-Dutch firm Gemalto rather than Britain’s De La Rue recently won the contract to make UK passports. Milk & More, which is owned by German dairy group Theo Mueller, makes more than 1.5 million deliveries a day to over 500,000 British households, Deutsche Post said on Monday. “We wanted to make this unique tradition relevant again to the requirements of today’s customers,” Patrick Mueller, managing director of Milk & More, said in a joint statement. Deutsche Post developed the StreetScooter for its own deliveries after growth in online shopping resulted in increased parcel deliveries.

2018-05-28,"(Repeats story published Sunday with no changes) By Julie Gordon and Rod Nickel VANCOUVER/WINNIPEG, Manitoba, May 28 (Reuters) - As a hard deadline set by Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd for scrapping a key pipeline expansion looms, there is growing doubt among investors, contractors and government officials about reaching a deal to save the C$7.4 billion ($5.7 billion) project. The company, a unit of Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc , set a May 31 deadline to decide if it will proceed with the expanded line from Edmonton, Alberta to a port in the Vancouver area, which would give landlocked Canadian crude greater access to foreign markets. The project’s fate will create political ripples in Ottawa, where Justin Trudeau’s Liberals have promised the pipeline will be built one way or another, and sway investor confidence in Canada’s oil sands, which already produce far more oil than can move on pipelines. Building more pipelines was a cornerstone of Trudeau’s energy policy. But the federal government is increasingly convinced that any assurances Ottawa gives Kinder Morgan will be rejected, said two sources with direct knowledge of the matter. They are not authorized to speak publicly. Investors and project contractors are also increasingly pessimistic. “I can’t walk out of my office or have a beer with someone where a conversation around this doesn’t occur,” said Rafi Tahmazian, senior portfolio manager at Canoe Financial, which manages shares of several Canadian oil producers. “I’m worried - very worried - that (Kinder) will walk away.” Kinder Morgan Canada declined to comment. If Trans Mountain fails, it would be the third major Canadian export pipeline project to stall in two years, putting greater pressure on Canadian heavy crude prices that already trade at a discount to global prices due to limited transport. Kinder Morgan set the deadline in part due to frustrations with delays caused by British Columbia government, which is concerned about possible oil spills. Trudeau has publicly vowed to build the pipeline with or without Kinder, and offered to indemnify the company against losses related to B.C.’s delays. KML’s share price has fallen 9.7 percent since early April, when the company halted all non-essential work, underperfoming a 5 percent rise in the benchmark Canada share index. “We think the stock itself is pricing in a less than 25-percent chance of the project going ahead,” said Matthew Murphy, an analyst with investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Co. Danny Mott, owner of Mott Electric, the electrical contractor on Trans Mountain, said he does not think the federal government has done enough to enforce its jurisdiction, nor to crack down on protesters who block access to Kinder Morgan work sites on a near-daily basis. “If we don’t have strong laws and the intent to follow through with them, I wouldn’t invest in that. I think I would walk away,” he said.

Upon being asked whether Stuttgart prosecutors were working with prosecutors in France as part of the Daimler probe, the spokesman said: “We are in an exchange with foreign authorities.” Some Mercedes-Benz models, including the Vito, use diesel engines supplied by Renault.

2018-05-28,"BERLIN/FRANKFURT, May 28 (Reuters) - Germany’s Transport Ministry grilled Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche on Monday over how many Mercedes-Benz vans and cars need to be fixed to meet emissions rules. The luxury carmaker was summoned to a closed-door meeting to discuss a regulatory probe of software devices found by Germany’s KBA motor vehicle authority. Daimler was last week ordered to recall Vito vans fitted with 1.6 litre engines because they breached emissions regulations. The inquiry follows the high-profile Volkswagen emissions test cheating scandal. “We will have an in depth exchange about highly complex technical questions with the aim of examining how many models are impacted,” German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer said, adding that Daimler has been given until June 15 to come up with a solution to resolve the emissions issues on the Vito. “At a further meeting in 14 days, concrete results will be on the table,” Scheuer added in a statement. Asked how the meeting went, Zetsche told Reuters: “It was a good discussion. We will see each other again in 14 days.” Germany’s transport ministry said the Vito had been equipped with a software device which manipulated the SCR emissions filtering function, leading to higher nitrogen oxide emissions. Bild am Sonntag, without citing sources, said regulators are probing around 40,000 Mercedes-Benz Vito vans and 80,000 C-Class models for possible illicit software that allowed the vehicles to emit excess pollution without detection. Daimler has said it will appeal against KBA’s decision to classify the software as illegal, and contest KBA’s findings in court if necessary, although it said it was cooperating fully. European carmakers have invested heavily in diesel engines, which produce less carbon dioxide but more of other pollutants blamed for causing respiratory disease than petrol engines. German cities are entitled to ban older diesel vehicles from streets with immediate effect to bring air pollution levels in line with European Union rules.

2018-05-28,"LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks gave up early gains and bond yields recovered from lows as early elections loomed in Italy after the anti-establishment 5-Star and League parties abandoned plans to form a government. European stocks were a mixed bag, after Asian shares mostly gained on signs the United States and North Korea were still working towards holding a summit.  Early in the European session, the euro, Italy’s government debt and its FTSE MIB stock index all rose in opening trades. But those gains quickly dissipated. European stocks were trading flat on the day and Italian bond yields were up 3 basis points on concern new elections would turn into a debate on euro membership. “We doubt this rally in markets has legs as what this means is that the next election in Italy becomes a referendum vote on euro membership,” said Frederik Ducrozet, senior European economist at Pictet Wealth Management. Italian President Sergio Mattarella is expected to ask former International Monetary Fund official Carlo Cottarelli on Monday to head a stopgap government. He will meet Cottarelli at 1130 am (0930 GMT) on Monday, an official said. His refusal to accept as economy minister Paolo Savona, who had threatened to pull Italy out of the euro, forced the 5-Star and the League to abandon efforts to form a government.     The euro initially rallied 0.6 percent to $1.1728, pulling itself above 6 1/2-month lows, but headed back towards the day’s lows to trade only 0.1 percent higher at $1.1655. The single currency strengthened by 0.8 percent against the Swiss franc, rebounding from near three-month lows to trade at 1.1629, but also gave up much of those gains. Italian 10-year bond yields had dropped 10 basis points to 2.35 percent in early trade, coming off one-year highs, but investors quickly booked profits, pushing yields up 3 basis points on the day. Italy’s FTSE MIB index turned negative on the day after climbing 1.4 percent earlier as financials and utilities stocks surged. “If there are new elections in autumn, then the populists are likely to get a stronger share and a more extreme mandate,” said Peter Chatwell, head of European rates strategy at Mizuho International. Europe’s STOXX 600, and Germany’s DAX were flat on the day. MSCI’s main European index was down 0.1 percent while its Asian counterpart rose 0.4 percent as a retreat in oil prices from record highs helped sentiment. Oil prices extended their decline from last week on growing expectations that major oil producers may ease their 17-month-old production cuts. A return to the oil production levels that were in place in October 2016, the baseline for the current deal to cut output, is one of the options for easing curbs, Russia’s energy minister said on Saturday. Brent crude futures dropped as much as 2.6 percent to $74.49 per barrel, their lowest in about three weeks. They last stood at $75.00, down 1.8 percent. U.S. crude futures dropped to six-week low of $65.80 per barrel, shedding 3.1 percent, and is on course to post its fifth day of decline. U.S. S&P500 mini futures rose 0.3 percent, but market holidays in the world’s two biggest financial centres — London and New York — could make trading slow and illiquid for the day.

The European Commission, in charge of ensuring a level playing field in the 28-country European Union, said the exemption increased the financial burden on other power users who had to pay a special levy introduced in 2012. The EU competition enforcer said the exemption, which Germany scrapped in 2014, was given to companies which used more than 10 gigawatt hours between 2011 and 2013.

2018-05-28,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Record crude oil volumes exported from the United States will be heading to Asia in the next couple of months to take another piece of the market away from Russia and producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).  The United States is set to export 2.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in June, of which 1.3 million bpd will head to Asia, estimated a senior executive with a key U.S. oil exporters.  Data from the Energy Information Administration shows U.S. oil exports peaked at 2.6 million bpd two weeks ago. [EIA/S]  The record outbound volumes come as U.S. crude production hit all-time highs, depressing U.S. prices to discounts of more than $9 a barrel below Brent crude futures on Monday, the widest in more than three years and opening an arbitrage for excess supplies to other markets. WTCLc1-LCOc1  The difference in the key benchmarks was a chance for Asian refiners to reduce light crude imports from the Middle East and Russia after Brent and Gulf prices touched multi-year highs, traders in Asia said.  “We’re diversifying a lot to other regions. If Saudi Aramco still doesn’t reduce prices next month and ADNOC (Abu Dhabi National Oil Company) follows, we will increase our U.S. crude purchases,” a Southeast Asian oil buyer said.  In Asia, China - led by Sinopec (600028.SS), the region’s largest refiner - is the biggest lifter of U.S. crude. The company, after cutting Saudi imports, has bought a record 16 million barrels (533,000 bpd) of U.S. crude, to load in June, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.  India and South Korea are the next biggest buyers in Asia, each lifting 6 million to 7 million barrels in June, sources tracking U.S. crude sales to Asia said. Indian Oil Corp (IOC.NS) bought 3 million barrels earlier this month via a tender, while Reliance Industries (RELI.NS) purchased up to 8 million barrels, the sources said, although it wasn’t clear if Reliance’s cargoes would all load in June.  The sources declined to be named due to company policies.  South Korea’s purchases are driven by its top refiners SK Energy [SKENGG.UL] and GS Caltex [GSCAL.UL]. Taiwanese state refiner CPC Corp [CHIP.UL] has also snapped up 7 million barrels to be lifted in June and July.  U.S. exports to Thailand will increase to at least 2 million barrels. State oil company PTT PCL (PTT.BK) is 1 million barrels of WTI Midland, while Thai Oil (TOP.BK) and Esso Thailand (ESSO.BK) bought at least 500,000 barrels of Bakken crude each, said traders with knowledge of the country’s crude deals.  Reliance declined to comment. PTT, Thai Oil and Esso Thailand all did not respond to requests for comment.  But even if Asia and Europe are keen to take more U.S. crude, the record volumes are straining export infrastructure in the United States, limiting its ability to pump and ship more oil.  “Tight (shale) oil’s been eating OPEC’s lunch for the last few years. The lack of infrastructure will temporarily cede market share back to OPEC,” R.T. Dukes, head of U.S. Lower 48 oil supply at Wood Mackenzie said in a note last week.

2018-05-28,"* Due to make landfall at Panama City - meteorologist * Alberto is first named Atlantic storm of 2018 * Threat to oil production areas in Gulf of Mexico lessened By John Herskovitz and Rich McKay May 28 (Reuters) - Subtropical Storm Alberto is expected to slam into the Florida Panhandle about mid-afternoon Monday, and wallop parts of the southeastern United States with drenching rains, blasting winds and possible tornadoes, officials said. Forecasters said it could bring life-threatening inundation to Southern coastal states. “It’s maintained its strength and wind speeds overnight, and it looks like it’s headed for landfall at Panama City, (Florida),” said David Roth, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. “It’ll probably hit land either mid or late afternoon,” he said. “It has maximum sustained winds of 65 mph, which is about 10 miles shy of being a hurricane. This is definitely a dangerous storm.” Thousands of Florida residents evacuated homes on Sunday as the storm headed north through the Gulf of Mexico. The storm was about 115 miles (185 km) southwest of Panama City, on the Gulf of Mexico coast as of 2 a.m. EDT, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Alberto, the first named Atlantic storm of 2018, which spun up days before the formal June 1 start of the hurricane season. There were a number of deadly hurricanes in the United States and Caribbean last year that walloped places including Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, causing hundreds of billions of dollars in damage, massive power outages and devastation to hundreds of thousands of structures. Alberto was expected to drop as much as 12 inches (30 cm) of rain, slamming an area from Mississippi to western Georgia, the Miami-based hurricane center said. After that, it will bring powerful winds and heavy rains as it moves into the Tennessee Valley on Tuesday and Wednesday, the hurricane center said. The storm comes during the Memorial Day weekend and was expected to scramble transportation on Monday as many people return from holiday travel. Alberto was also forecast to bring storm swells of about 2 to 4 feet (60-120 cm) to low-lying areas that were “likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions”. A water spout, a dangerous vortex of wind and water, was spotted late Sunday about 7 miles off shore of Alligator Point, Florida, said Roth. Franklin County, in the Florida Panhandle, has issued a mandatory evacuation for its barrier islands in the Gulf of Mexico affecting some 4,200 housing units, while Taylor County, to the east, has a voluntary evacuation order in place for its coastal areas. Florida Governor Rick Scott, who issued a state of emergency on Saturday in all of the state’s 67 counties, said on Sunday that the Florida National Guard had 5,500 guard members ready to be deployed if needed. “If evacuations have been ordered in your community, do not ignore them,” Scott said on Twitter. Governors in Alabama and Mississippi also declared states of emergency on Saturday. The National Weather Service has issued a flash flood watch for an area stretching from Mississippi to North Carolina that is home to millions of people. Alberto’s projected storm track has shifted eastward since Friday, lessening its threat to the active oil production areas in the Gulf of Mexico. Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp have evacuated some personnel from offshore Gulf oil facilities. A separate storm system on Sunday caused flash flooding in the Baltimore suburb of Ellicott City, Maryland, turning its historic Main Street into a raging river with water reaching past the first floor of buildings and sweeping cars down the road, local news video showed. Governor Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency for the area rebuilding from a devastating flood about two years ago that killed two people and damaged dozens of buildings.

2018-05-28,"OSLO, May 28 (Reuters) - Norwegian oil and gas exploration will continue to rebound amid higher crude prices, a survey by the national statistics agency (SSB) showed on Monday, although the overall pace of investment by the industry was slower than most analysts had expected. While exploration for new resources and in field development plans is expected to rise significantly this year and next, the investments at fields that are already in operation will decline, according to the closely watched quarterly report. Investment in exploration and concept studies, a key indicator of spending on anything from drilling rigs to seismic data, was forecast to rise to 33.3 billion crowns in 2019 from 25 billion in 2018. Overall 2018 investment plans were cut by some 2.1 percent since February, and are now seen amounting to 156.5 billion Norwegian crowns ($19.23 billion), an increase of 1.4 percent over 2017. While initial forecasts for 2019 also point to near-flat spending, oil firms are expected to present more plans ahead, which will likely lift spending. “If the schedules for these plans are realised, the accumulated investment costs in 2019 from these projects will increase the investments in field development even more, compared to the present estimate,” SSB wrote. Economists said the decline in 2018 forecasts was a surprise, but maintained forecasts for a central bank rate hike to come later this year. “It’s a bit weaker than expected,” said SEB economist Erica Blomgren, while adding that one-of factors were partly to blame and that upward revisions were likely to follow. Nordea Markets also said the main numbers were on the weak side of expectations. “Our interpretation is that the underlying pace remains good however. We expect strong oil prices and a further rise in investments,” said Chief Economist Kjetil Olsen. It was SSB’s first release of companies’ forecasts for 2019 and the fifth prediction for 2018. $1 = 8.1391 Norwegian crowns

The euro bounced back from a 6-1/2-month low after the Italian president rejected a eurosceptic as a key economy minister. But his move was seen as triggering a possible constitutional crisis and opening the prospect of fresh elections, keeping the single currency fragile. Oil prices extended their decline from last week on growing expectations that major oil producers may ease their 17-month-old production cuts. A return to the oil production levels that were in place in October 2016, the baseline for the current deal to cut output, is one of the options for easing curbs, Russia’s energy minister said on Saturday. His comments came after the energy ministers of Russia and Saudi Arabia met to review the terms of global oil supply, ahead of a key OPEC meeting in Vienna next month.

German and French stock futures  were up 0.4 percent. South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.8 percent, buoyed by stocks which are seen as benefitting from a further thawing in tensions with Pyongyang. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5 percent. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.1 percent. President Donald Trump said on Sunday a U.S. team had arrived in North Korea to prepare for a proposed summit between him and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which Trump pulled out of last week before reconsidering. “While we can’t say for sure how much they can agree, both sides seem to want to make progress,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. Mizuho sees a 10 percent chance that the summit, so far planned on June 12, will not take place, a 20 percent chance of a deal leading to a peace treaty struck at the meeting and a 70 percent likelihood of the summit leading to more talks without producing immediate deals on denuclearisation, he said. In the currency market, the euro bounced back 0.6 percent to $1.1720 after having a touched a 6-1/2-month low of $1.1646 on Friday. Italian president Sergio Mattarella rejected a eurosceptic pick for the key economy ministry by the two anti-establishment parties aiming to form a coalition government, the 5-Star Movement and the League. While his decision allayed immediate concerns of having a eurosceptic minister in the euro zone’s third-largest economy, his move created bigger uncertainties as 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio, whose party won the most seats at an inconclusive March 4 vote, demanded that parliament impeach Mattarella. The 10-year Italian bond yield has risen 67 basis points, or 0.67 percentage point, so far this month, on course to make its biggest monthly rise since late 2011. Its yield spread over benchmark German Bunds rose above 200 basis points for the first time in over a year. “If the Italian debt prices fall further, people will have to do more hedging, say by selling the euro and so on. The issue will be the biggest focus for markets this week,” While no one thinks the country will default, people need to make hedging when they face sharp price moves,” said Takafumi Yamawaki, head of currency and fixed income research at J.P. Morgan Securities in Tokyo. Investors are also increasingly wary of Spain, where Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is facing growing pressure to resign over a graft case involving his party. The spread of the Spanish-German debt yields rose to about 105 basis points, the highest since January. “The euro is being bought back in the near term but it looks capped at around $1.17. But we haven’t seen the kind of panic we saw before the French presidential election last year. I’d bet the euro will slip gradually than fall sharply,” said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale.

Oil prices extended their decline from last week on growing expectations that major oil producers may ease their 17-month-old production cuts. A return to the oil production levels that were in place in October 2016, the baseline for the current deal to cut output, is one of the options for easing curbs, Russia’s energy minister said on Saturday. His comments came after the energy ministers of Russia and Saudi Arabia met to review the terms of global oil supply, ahead of a key OPEC meeting in Vienna next month. Brent crude futures dropped as much as 2.6 percent to $74.49 per barrel, their lowest level in about three weeks. They last stood at $75.00, down 1.8 percent. U.S. crude futures dropped to six-week low of $65.80 per barrel, shedding 3.1 percent and is on course to post its fifth day of decline. U.S. S&P500 mini futures rose 0.4 percent in Asian trade, but market holidays in the world’s two biggest financial centres — London and New York — could make trading slow and illiquid for the day. South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.7 percent, buoyed by stocks which are seen as benefitting from a further thawing in tensions with Pyongyang. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei lost steam to trade flat and the broader Topix dipped 0.2 percent. President Donald Trump said on Sunday a U.S. team had arrived in North Korea to prepare for a proposed summit between him and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which Trump pulled out of last week before reconsidering. “While we can’t say for sure how much they can agree, both sides seem to want to make progress,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. Mizuho sees a 10 percent chance that the summit, so far planned on June 12, will not take place, a 20 percent chance of a truce deal struck at the meeting and a 70 percent likelihood of the summit leading to more talks without producing immediate deals on denuclearisation, he said. In the currency market, the euro bounced back 0.5 percent to $1.1705 after having a touched a 6-1/2-month low of $1.1646 on Friday. Italian president Sergio Mattarella rejected a eurosceptic pick for the key economy ministry by the two anti-establishment parties aiming to form a coalition government, the 5-Star Movement and the League. While his decision allayed immediate concerns of having a eurosceptic minister in the euro zone’s third-largest economy, his move created bigger uncertainties as 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio, whose party won the most seats at an inconclusive March 4 vote, demanded that parliament impeach Mattarella. The 10-year Italian bond yield has risen 67 basis points, or 0.67 percentage point, so far this month, on course to make its biggest monthly rise since late 2011. Its yield spread over benchmark German Bunds rose above 200 basis points for the first time in over a year. “If the Italian debt prices fall further, people will have to do more hedging, say by selling the euro and so on. The issue will be the biggest focus for markets this week,” While no one thinks the country will default, people need to make hedging when they face sharp price moves,” said Takafumi Yamawaki, head of currency and fixed income research at J.P. Morgan Securities in Tokyo. Investors are also increasingly wary of Spain, where Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is facing growing pressure to resign over a graft case involving his party. The spread of the Spanish-German debt yields rose to about 105 basis points, the highest since January. “The euro is being bought back in the near term but it looks capped at around $1.17. But we haven’t seen the kind of panic we saw before the French presidential election last year. I’d bet the euro will slip gradually than fall sharply,” said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale.

2018-05-28,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China LNG imports vs. spot price: * reut.rs/2Jam75C By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, May 28 (Reuters) - The slack period for liquefied natural gas (LNG) in top consumer Asia is usually the shoulder season between winter and summer, or March to May, but this pattern hasn’t really repeated this year. The spot price of the super-chilled fuel in Asia LNG-AS has been on a rising trend since the beginning of April, and hit $9.20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at the end of last week. It touched its low for 2018 of $7 per mmBtu in the week ended March 29, remained unchanged the next week and then posted gains in six of the seven weeks since. Last year, the shoulder season low of $5.40 per mmBtu was first reached in late March, and the price drifted in a narrow band until early July, when it started climbing from $5.45 in the week to July 7, 2017. In 2016, the low was hit in early April before a mild rally for the northern summer, and then another dip in the autumn shoulder season before strong gains in the winter period. What appears to be different so far this year is that while seasonal price fluctuations are still evident, the dip was shallower than in previous years and the rally from the low looks sharper so far. Spot LNG fell 39 percent from its peak of $11.50 per mmBtu for the winter of 2018 to the low in late March, while in 2017 the slump from winter peak to shoulder season low was 45 percent, and it was 49 percent the prior year. So far LNG has rallied 31 percent from the low, in the space of eight weeks. In 2017, eight weeks after reaching the low, LNG had gained just 12 percent, while the increase was 26 percent in 2016. What the numbers show is that while seasonality is still in place, the price lows aren’t as deep as in previous years and the rally from that low appears to be on track to be steeper and higher. The easy explanation for this dynamic is China, which has continued to buy LNG at a frantic pace this year, after the 46.4 percent jump in imports in 2017 to a total of 38.1 million tonnes, making it the world’s second-biggest buyer behind Japan. China’s LNG imports rose 58 percent to 15.8 million tonnes in the first four months of this year compared to the same period a year earlier, according to customs data. This would put it on target for imports of more than 47 million tonnes for the full year, but this is likely to be a conservative estimate, given LNG buying tend to ramp up in the months ahead of the peak winter demand period. But it’s not just China that is sucking up more LNG, with South Korea making a bid to reclaim its former place as the world’s second-biggest importer. In the first four months of the year South Korea brought in 16.2 million tonnes of LNG, up 18.2 percent from the same period last year, according customs data. Even top importer Japan is buying modestly more LNG, with imports in the first quarter up 1.1 percent from the same period in 2017, a faster pace of growth than the 0.4 percent for the whole of 2017. It’s not only the top three importers that are showing growth, with total global seaborne LNG flows rising, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts. In the first five months of 2018, a total of 125.1 million tonnes of LNG has been discharged, a figure that may rise to closer to 133 million by the end of this month as more vessels are unloaded. This would be some 14 million tonnes, or almost 12 percent, more than the 118.9 million tonnes discharged in the first five months of last year. The data shows that while China is the standout when it comes to driving LNG demand and prices, it’s not the only show in town.

2018-05-28,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil’s President Michel Temer announced late on Sunday new measures to reduce operating costs for truckers in a bid to end a week-long protest that has severely hampered the flow of food, fuel and key exports in Latin America’s largest economy. In a televised speech, Temer said he was signing three decrees with immediate effect to address the main demands of truck drivers, who mounted hundreds of blockades on roads across the country to protest high diesel prices.  “We gave everything they have asked for,” said Temer of the measures, expected to cost Brazilian taxpayers some 10 billion reais ($2.7 billion). It was not immediately clear if protesting truckers would demobilize on Monday.   After seven days of protests, shortages of basic goods around the country had become increasingly critical. Hospitals reported a lack of medical supplies, while many farm animals are dying or being culled because of a lack of feed. Brazil is a global leader in commodities exports and industry groups said they expected delays in shipments from everything from soybeans to meats and sugar.   Major cities such as Rio de Janeiro have sharply reduced public transportation, while many schools and universities said they would not open on Monday. With gas stations low on fuel across most of the country, police and military forces have been escorting fuel convoys to supply ambulances, police vehicles and buses for public transportation in most large cities in Brazil. One of the presidential decrees signed by Temer cuts diesel prices by 46 centavos per litre, or about 12 percent of its retail price, for a period of 60 days. The government will compensate state-led oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA for the price cut.  Another decree ordered toll operators across the country not to charge for rear axles that are not in use, as is the case when trucks pass by the tolls unloaded. A third decree mandates the minimum fare for freight to be paid to truckers.  The measures were announced after several meetings between government officials and representatives for some trucker groups. The fractured leadership of the trucking movement has made it hard to gauge the acceptance of previous compromises reached by the government and negotiators from the industry.  Earlier on Sunday, Sao Paulo Governor Marcio França, who has been acting as a negotiator, had said the federal government would not accept the demand to reduce diesel prices for 60 days. Some highway blockades were cleared early on Sunday, as police started to fine drivers who left trucks at road sides. The military was ordered to remove unattended vehicles. The military said that the entrances to some ports, such as Santos, Latin America’s largest export hub, were cleared, but there were still no trucks arriving by late Sunday to the area to replenish silos and allow for ship-loading operations.

2018-05-28,"CAPE TOWN, May 28 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Bulelwa Makalima-Ngewana knows how much cash going green can save. Four years ago, after signing up for “My Green Home” – an effort by the Green Building Council of South Africa to make buildings more energy efficient – her family saw their house in the middle-class suburb of Pinelands retrofitted with energy saving LED lights, low-flow showerheads and roof-top solar panels, as well as winter insulation. As part of the green makeover, the family also learned to cut their energy use by hanging laundry out to dry rather than using a tumble dryer, switching off appliances that aren’t being used, and switching to washing laundry with cold water. “My children were very excited as we got to do this as a family,” Makalima-Ngewana, a consultant at the University of Cape Town’s Graduate School of Business, told the Thompson Reuters Foundation. Better yet, since joining the programme, her family’s energy costs have fallen by nearly 90 percent, she said. As South African cities aim to battle the effects of climate change, from drought in Cape Town to the threat of rising seas and flooding in Durban, four cities have banded together to try to create zero-carbon buildings, which produce no contribution to climate change in their use of energy. Working in conjunction with the C40 Cities initiative – a group of major world cities trying to cut climate-changing emissions - the plan is to require new buildings in Johannesburg, Cape Town, eThekwini (formerly Durban) and Tshwane (formerly Pretoria) to become much more energy efficient, to cut electricity bills and greenhouse gas emissions. Tim Pryce, who runs C40 energy and buildings programmes worldwide, said the effort seeks to help South African cities rapidly scale up low-carbon building efforts and share what they learn with other cities. Buildings make up the largest single source of emissions in C40 cities globally, with over half of the total emissions, he said. “If we are to avoid hugely damaging impacts from climate change - impacts that will make the current water shortage in Cape Town look minor - we need to drive these emissions down as rapidly as possible, towards net zero carbon all around the world by 2050 at the latest,” Pryce told Thompson Reuters Foundation. ‘NET-ZERO’ FUTURE Cities that achieve “net zero carbon” would produce very few climate-changing emissions, with those still produced offset by means such as planting carbon-absorbing trees. Ensuring new buildings are highly efficient and run largely on renewable energy is crucial to try to limit global warming to relatively safe levels, Pryce said. “Our target is to work with the four cities to bring policies, such as better building codes or more ambitious planning requirements, into effect by the end of 2020,” he said. Building experts from Sustainable Energy Africa, an organisation that promotes equitable and low carbon clean energy development, will work with teams in the target South African cities to make that happen, he said. “It is indeed a good thing,” said Thulani Kuzwayo, a marketer with the Green Building Council South Africa (GBCSA), which has certified over 300 “Green Star” buildings since 2009. To achieve the certification buildings must be energy efficient, comfortable, handle waste responsibly and contain spaces that contribute to the health and well-being of their users. The effort “can shift paradigms in planning, design, construction and building operation,” said Kuzwayo, who is also chair of World Green Building Council’s African regional network. Because many buildings are made to last up to 50-100 years, building them for efficiency can result in a huge savings in climate-changing emissions over time, Kuzwayo said. However, South Africa is still at the early stages of adopting green building standards, he said. “The problems encountered include the common perception that green buildings are expensive. They can be but they don’t have to be,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Perceived elitism associated with green buildings also can be an issue, as people tend to view them as expensive, he said. He said changes in how buildings are created must be led by governments “for the desired scale and impact”. “If government leads in constructing and operating energy-efficient buildings, it will propel the adoption drastically,” Kuzwayo said. Sometimes, the worries each city faces can help drive action. In Cape Town, the “My Green Home” effort launched “right after the power utility, Eskom, had problems to provide adequate electricity in the country,” remembers Makalima-Ngewana, whose household was chosen as one of the programme’s pioneers. “People were challenged to come up with alternative ways to save and use power,” she said. Now Cape Town has a new worry: water supplies, in the face of longer droughts linked to climate change. Makalima-Ngewana’s family is now adapting to that as well, through things like reusing household wastewater as part of the city’s home greening efforts. “Though the initial focus was strongly focused on energy saving – we still do it up to now – due to water problems we also now utilise our grey water at home,” she said.

2018-05-28,"* Saudi Arabia, Russia set to raise supplies by 1 million bpd * U.S. output has surged by over 27 pct in two years * But climbing supply from top producers comes amid record demand (Releads with lower prices, adds Shanghai crude futures, comment) By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, May 28 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Monday, extending a steep decline in the previous session, as the market eyed an increase in output from the world’s three top crude producers, Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia. Brent crude futures were at $75.34 per barrel at 0124 GMT, down $1.10, or 1.4 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $66.31 a barrel, down $1.57, or 2.3 percent. Brent and WTI have fallen by 6.4 percent and nearly 9 percent respectively from peaks reached earlier in May. In China, Shanghai crude oil futures tumbled by 4.5 percent to 459 yuan ($71.83) per barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), as well as top producer but non-OPEC member Russia, started withholding supplies in 2017 to tighten the market and prop up prices, which in 2016 fell to a more than a decade low of under $30 per barrel. But prices have soared since the start of the cuts, with Brent breaking through $80 per barrel earlier in May, triggering consumer concerns that high prices would crimp economic growth and stoke inflation. “The pace of the recent rise in oil prices has sparked a debate among investors on whether this poses downside risks to global growth,” Chetan Ahya, Chief Economist at U.S. bank Morgan Stanley wrote over the weekend in a note. To address potential supply shortfalls, Saudi Arabia, de-facto leader of producer cartel OPEC, as well as top producer Russia said on Friday they were discussing raising oil production by some 1 million bpd. “Crude oil prices collapsed ... after reports emerged that Saudi Arabia and Russia had agreed to increase crude oil production in the second-half of the year to make up for losses elsewhere under the production cut agreement,” ANZ bank said on Monday. Meanwhile, surging U.S. crude production also showed no sign of abating as drillers continue to expand their search for new oil fields to exploit. U.S. energy companies added 15 rigs looking for new oil in the week ending May 25, bringing the rig-count to 859, the highest level since 2015, in a strong indicator that American crude production will continue to rise. U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA has already surged by more than 27 percent in the last two years, to 10.73 million barrels per day (bpd), bringing its output ever closer to that of Russia, which pumps around 11 million bpd.

2018-05-28,"(Adds latest movements of storm, Maryland flooding) By Jon Herskovitz May 27 (Reuters) - Thousands of Florida residents evacuated homes on Sunday as Subtropical Storm Alberto picked up strength as it headed north through the Gulf of Mexico, with forecasters saying it could bring life-threatening inundation to Southern coastal states. The storm was about 105 miles (165 km) south of Apalachicola, Florida, on the Gulf of Mexico coast as of 8 p.m. EDT (0000 GMT) and was expected to make landfall along the Florida Panhandle on Monday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Alberto, the first named Atlantic storm of 2018, which spun up days before the formal June 1 start of the hurricane season, was packing maximum sustained winds near 65 miles per hour (105 kph) and was expected to drop as much as 12 inches (30 cm) of rain, slamming an area from Mississippi to western Georgia, the Miami-based hurricane center said. After that, it will bring powerful winds and heavy rains as it moves into the Tennessee Valley on Tuesday and Wednesday, the hurricane center said. The storm comes during the Memorial Day weekend and was expected to scramble transportation on Monday as many people return from holiday travel. Isolated tornadoes were possible across the central and northern Florida peninsula on Sunday night, according to the hurricane center, while Alberto was also forecast to bring storm swells of about 2 to 4 feet (60-120 cm) to low-lying areas that were “likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.” There were a number of deadly hurricanes in the United States and Caribbean last year that walloped places including Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, causing hundreds of billions of dollars in damage, massive power outages and devastation to hundreds of thousands of structures. Franklin County, in the Florida Panhandle, has issued a mandatory evacuation for its barrier islands in the Gulf of Mexico affecting some 4,200 housing units, while Taylor County, to the east, has a voluntary evacuation order in place for its coastal areas. Florida Governor Rick Scott, who issued a state of emergency on Saturday in all of the state’s 67 counties, said on Sunday that the Florida National Guard had 5,500 guard members ready to be deployed if needed. “If evacuations have been ordered in your community, do not ignore them,” Scott said on his Twitter feed. The National Weather Service has issued a flash flood watch for an area stretching from Mississippi to North Carolina that is home to millions of people. Alberto’s projected storm track has shifted eastward since Friday, lessening its threat to the active oil production areas in the Gulf of Mexico. Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp have evacuated some personnel from offshore Gulf oil facilities. A separate storm system on Sunday caused flash flooding in the Baltimore suburb of Ellicott City, Maryland, turning its historic Main Street into a raging river with water reaching past the first floor of buildings and sweeping cars down the road, local news video showed. Governor Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency for the area rebuilding from a devastating flood about two years ago that killed two people and damaged dozens of buildings.

The euro edged up from a 6-1/2-month low but is seen vulnerable after efforts to form a coalition government in Italy, the currency bloc’s third-biggest economy, collapsed over the weekend.
