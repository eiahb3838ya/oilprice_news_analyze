2018-04-02,"(Reuters) - Baker Hughes (BHGE.N), the oilfield services company controlled by General Electric Co (GE.N), is exploring a sale of its gas detection and metering business that could be worth around $900 million (640.8 million pounds), people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Oilfield services firms are seeking to tighten their focus to their core operations, as oil prices continue their recovery from their January 2016 lows.  Baker Hughes’ unit for sale, which makes sensors and monitors for industrial clients such as petrochemical makers and power generators, is expected to attract interest from other manufacturers of such devices, according to one of the sources. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Baker Hughes declined to comment.  Oilfield service firms are still rebounding from the 2014-2016 crude price crash, which prompted mass layoffs and cost cutting across the sector. Although oil prices have now climbed to above $60 a barrel, many firms remain under pressure as exploration and production companies continue to slash service costs. In December, Baker Hughes rival Weatherford International Plc (WFT.N) sold its stake in a North American pressure pumping and well operations joint venture to partner Schlumberger (SLB.N) for $430 million in a bid to raise cash and pay down debt. General Electric merged its oilfield services business with Baker Hughes last July, giving it a controlling stake in the combined company and creating the world’s second largest oilfield service provider by revenue. Baker Hughes Chief Executive Lorenzo Simonelli said last week the new company was on track to achieve some $700 million in savings this year on account of the deal.

2018-04-02,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Monday rejected an Obama-era plan to make automobiles more fuel efficient, opening up a long process to weaken current standards and putting California and the federal government on a collision course over vehicle emissions. Scott Pruitt, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said in a statement that the standards on model year 2022 to 2025 vehicles were not appropriate and should be revised.  The Obama administration set the average fleet-wide fuel efficiency standards “too high” and “made assumptions about the standards that didn’t comport with reality,” Pruitt said. He did not offer specifics on revising them.     The standards called for roughly doubling by 2025 the average fuel efficiency of new vehicles sold in the United States to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon. Proponents said they could help spur innovation in clean technologies. California has long been allowed by an EPA waiver to impose stricter standards than Washington does on vehicle emissions of some pollutants. And 12 other states, including New York, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, follow California’s lead on cleaner cars.     That has set up a battle on vehicle efficiency between California, the most populous U.S. state and a massive car market, and the administration of President Donald Trump.  Pruitt is a big proponent of states’ rights to regulate themselves, but opposes California’s push for greener cars. California’s waiver to impose its own efficiency standards is being re-examined, the EPA said.  It is in “America’s best interest to have a national standard,” Pruitt said in the release. California Governor Jerry Brown blasted the EPA’s action. “This cynical and meretricious abuse of power will poison our air and jeopardize the health of all Americans,” Brown said.    Mary Nichols, the head of the California Air Resources Board, said her state “will vigorously defend the existing clean vehicle standards.”  Auto industry executives have not publicly sought specific reductions in the requirements negotiated with the Obama administration in 2011 as part of a bailout deal. But they have urged Pruitt and Trump to revise the Obama standards so it becomes easier and less costly to meet complex targets, which vary depending on the size of vehicles and whether they are classified as cars or trucks. Automakers also want to avoid a patchwork of rules that would add costs to engine manufacturing. “The best way to achieve our collective goals is under a single national program that provides an aggressive but achievable pathway, a variety of compliance tools, and factors in the role of customers,” said John Bozzella, president and chief executive officer of the Association of Global Automakers. Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said Pruitt made the right decision and that the administration was working on a way to both increase fuel economy and “keep new vehicles affordable to more Americans.” Changes to the standards could affect car manufacturers, including Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co and Tesla Inc Auto suppliers were cautiously optimistic about the creation of a national fuel efficiency plan. Steve Handschuh, head of the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, said while his group supports adjustments and flexibilities “we do not support significant changes to the standards.”  Environmentalists decried Pruitt’s decision, saying stricter standards would slash emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Proponents of the corporate average fuel economy standards, or CAFE, say they have led to big gains in auto technology and that relaxing them could eventually hurt sales of U.S. cars in European and Asian countries that are moving toward mandates for electric cars.  It would “take America backward by jeopardizing successful safeguards that are working to clean our air, save drivers money at the pump, and drive technological innovation that creates jobs,” said Luke Tonachel, a clean vehicles advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

2018-04-02,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar slid on Monday as China raised tariffs on U.S. goods in an escalating spat between the world’s two biggest economies while stocks on Wall Street tumbled, led by a rout in technology shares, after President Donald Trump again attacked Amazon.com. China bumped up tariffs by as much as 25 percent on 128 U.S. products, from frozen pork and wine to fruits and nuts, in response to U.S. duties on imports of aluminum and steel. Gold snapped a three-session losing streak and the dollar fell after the tariffs, which are due to take effect on Monday, were announced late Sunday by China’s finance ministry. The three major U.S. stock indexes fell more than 2 percent each as the rout wiped out the tech-heavy Nasdaq index’s gains for the year and sent the benchmark S&P 500 crashing through its 200-day moving average, a closely watched technical indicator. It was the first time the index closed below its 200-day moving average since June 2016 in the wake of Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, known as Brexit. Trading was light as major European markets closed for Easter Monday. Markets in Australia and Hong Kong also were shut. Shares of Amazon, Microsoft, Intel and Facebook were the biggest drag on MSCI’s all-country world stock index, which fell 1.23 percent.  The four companies also were the biggest weights on the benchmark S&P 500 index as it broke through its 200-day moving average after threatening to do so the past five sessions. “It’s a technical breakdown. A house catches on fire, it burns rather quickly and that is what is happening now,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. “Until we get to the earnings season, this market is going to shed more pain,” he said, referring to first-quarter corporate results that will begin in earnest in two weeks.  Nicholas Colas, co-founder of Datatrek Research in New York, said there was a “reset” on how much exposure to technology shares investors are willing to bear. “This is still primarily a tech-led sell-off and what we’ve learned over the past two weeks is just how overweight investors were in technology,” Colas said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 458.92 points, or 1.9 percent, to 23,644.19. The S&P 500 lost 58.99 points, or 2.23 percent, to 2,581.88 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 193.33 points, or 2.74 percent, to 6,870.12. The Dow is now down 4.4 percent for the year, the S&P 500 is off 3.4 percent and the Nasdaq 0.48 percent. The tariff announcement from China was not new and was not bearish but is an ongoing uncertainty, said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta. “What you’re seeing in the market is a change in leadership,” he said. Trump’s comments on Amazon weighed on equities but further news on U.S.-China trade expected this week has drawn investor interest, said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Co Inc in Boston. “Everybody is bracing for that,” Kleintop said of expected U.S. tariffs on $50 billion to $60 billion a year of imports from China that will likely intensify U.S.-China tensions. The Trump administration will unveil by Friday a list of advanced technology Chinese imports targeted for U.S. tariffs to punish Beijing over technology transfer policies. Amazon’s stock fell 5.2 percent after Trump attacked the online retailer over the pricing of its deliveries through the U.S. postal system and promised unspecified changes. “Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money-losing Post Office makes money with Amazon,” Trump tweeted. Intel shares closed down 6.1 percent after Bloomberg reported Apple is planning to use its own chips in Mac computers beginning in 2020. The dollar fell for a second straight session. The dollar index fell 0.13 percent, with the euro down 0.16 percent to $1.2301. The Japanese yen firmed 0.31 percent versus the greenback at 105.94 per dollar. Oil fell more than 2 percent, pressured by a rise in Russian production, expectations that Saudi Arabia will cut prices of the crude it sends to Asia, and a deepening trade spat between China and the United States. Brent crude fell $1.70 to settle $67.64 a barrel. U.S. crude settled down $1.93 at $63.01.  U.S. drillers cut seven oil rigs in the week to March 29, bringing the total down to 797, the first decline in three weeks. The rig count is closely watched as an indicator of future U.S. oil output. U.S. Treasury prices rose, with benchmark 10-year notes up 1/32 in price, pushing yields down to 2.7407 percent. Gold, which is often seen as a store of value during times of financial or political uncertainty, rose. U.S. gold futures for June delivery settled up $19.60 at $1,346.90 per ounce.

2018-04-02,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil fell by more than 2 percent on Monday, pressured by a rise in Russian production, expectations that Saudi Arabia will cut prices of the crude it sends to Asia and a deepening trade spat between China and the United States.   Brent crude LCOc1 fell $1.70, or 2.5 percent, to settle at $67.64 a barrel. That was the lowest level since March 21. U.S. crude CLc1 lost $1.93, or 3 percent, to settle at $63.01, its lowest since March 20.  Trade sources told Reuters on Monday that Saudi Arabia was expected to cut prices for all crude grades it sells to Asia in May to reflect weaker prices for its Middle East benchmark Dubai crude.  “There is speculation that the Saudis are going to lower prices for their Asian customers,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York. “That is not really the kind of thing you do when you want to keep production cuts in place.”  Production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia have lifted oil prices in the past year.  Despite the supply cut agreement, Russian output rose in March to 10.97 million bpd from 10.95 million bpd in February, official data showed.     Also, in an escalation of the dispute between the world’s biggest economies, China increased tariffs by up to 25 percent on 128 U.S. products. “Increasing trade friction between China and the U.S. is likely to rock global markets and tarnish bullish sentiment in crude oil markets,” said Wang Xiao of Guotai Junan Futures.     Brent crude reached a 2018 high of $71.28 in January but has since struggled to pass that level. Two rallies last week ran out of steam just beyond $71, a chart pattern known as a double top, which is usually bearish. Another bearish factor is Bahrain’s discovery of its largest oilfield in decades, analyst John Macaluso of Tyche Capital Advisors said. Rising U.S. crude production has also limited price gains. Official data released on Friday showed output rose by 6,000 bpd in January to 9.964 million bpd. U.S. crude stocks in Cushing, Oklahoma, are now close to their minimums, which means that inventory data this week will likely show a build, Yawger said. That would be bearish for prices, he said.  U.S.-Iranian tensions lent some support to crude.  “The Iranian factor is going to be a very significant input for the next four weeks,” said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix.  U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to pull out of a 2015 international nuclear deal with Tehran under which Iranian oil exports have risen. He gave European signatories a May 12 deadline to fix the deal.

2018-04-02,"NEW YORK, April 2 (Reuters) - Prices of renewable fuel credits slumped 35.7 percent in the first three months of 2018, their biggest quarterly loss in a year, on uncertainty over the future of U.S. biofuels policy. This has been the second straight year of uncertainty for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a 2005 law requiring fuel producers to blend increasing volumes of renewable fuels like ethanol with petroleum-based counterparts. Those who cannot blend these fuels are required to purchase credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs). Those credits once cost just a few cents, but the price has risen with more ambitious requirements for biofuels use to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The RFS program, also aimed at reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil and boosting rural economies, has expanded the market for corn-based fuels. But independent refiners have complained as the price of the credits at times has exceeded $1 each. Philadelphia Energy Solutions declared bankruptcy this year citing the costs, though Reuters also reported on other factors. President Donald Trump held several meetings at the White House, trying to bridge a gap between big oil and big corn. Sources now say, however, that he has decided to leave reform to Congress. “Since last summer, it’s been one big raging political battle in D.C. about changing the implementation of the Renewable Fuel Standard,” said Scott Irwin, agricultural economist at the University of Illinois. Uncertainty surrounding the program, along with the PES bankruptcy, pressured prices of the renewable fuel credits. They fell to a one-year low of 35 cents apiece in mid-March, according to data from the Oil price Information Service (OPIS), from a Jan. 2 high of 72 cents. The credits closed the quarter at 44.5 cents. Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, has suggested a 10-cent cap on such credits, while biofuel advocates say the price will naturally fall as consumption increases. Any change will be difficult to push through as the 2018 midterm elections approach. Lawmakers in farm states and those from states with large energy sectors will face election-year pressure from their powerful constituencies. Irwin said prices for renewable fuel credits may rebound in the short term, then drift downward in one to three years. Refiners are not convinced the law is working. “In no other market that I know of do you see such wild swings, such volatility,” said Brendan Williams, vice president of PBF Energy, which has pushed for reform or repeal of the program. “We’re hopeful that right now, we have more substantive dialogue at a higher level than any time I can remember.” (Reporting by Ayenat Mersie; Editing by David Gregorio)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-biofuels-credits/renewable-fuel-credits-post-biggest-quarterly-loss-in-a-year-idUKL1N1RB2G8,02 Apr 2018,"Prices of renewable fuel

2018-04-02,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey’s TAEK atomic energy authority on Monday granted Russian builder Rosatom a construction licence to start work on the first unit of the Akkuyu nuclear power plant, the state-run Anadolu news agency said. The grant comes a day before a visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin to Ankara, where Putin and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan will also attend a ceremony to officially launch Akkuyu’s first unit. “As a result of the construction licence process, an important step in the project started nearly three years ago, being completed ... it has been decided by TAEK to grant a construction licence for the construction of the first unit of the Akkuyu Nuclear Plant,” Anadolu quoted a TAEK statement. The $20 billion, 4,800 megawatt (MW) plant, is part of Erdogan’s “2023 vision” marking 100 years since the founding of modern Turkey and is intended to reduce Turkey’s dependence on energy imports. However, since Russia was awarded the contract in 2010, the project has been beset by delays. Last month, sources familiar with the matter said Akkuyu was likely to miss its 2023 target start-up date, but Rosatom, which is looking for local partners to take a 49 percent stake in the project, said it is committed to the timetable. The Interfax news agency later cited the head of Rosatom saying that the sale of the 49 percent stake was likely to be postponed from this year until 2019. Turkish companies have been put off by the size of the financing required as well as by concerns they will not receive a sufficient share of the lucrative construction side of the deal, two industry sources have said. Putin will make a two-day visit to Turkey from Tuesday where he will meet Erdogan and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani for a summit on Syria.

2018-04-02,"(Updates with U.S. trader quote, price reaction in paragraph 14-15) BEIJING, April 2 (Reuters) - Chinese buyers of U.S. ethanol will have to cut imports because of higher tariffs, but eventually will have to return to the overseas market to meet government targets for using the fuel, industry participants and analysts said on Monday. China said late on Sunday it will slap an extra 15 percent tariff on ethanol imports from the United States, part of its response to U.S. duties on aluminium and steel imports. The previous duty was 30 percent. The tariffs, effective Monday, will neutralize cost savings from importing cheaper U.S. ethanol versus domestic supply, said three sources that participate in the market. Ethanol, an alcohol typically produced from corn or sugar, is often mixed with gasoline to reduce air pollution from vehicle emissions. “The price difference is gone. We will suspend imports for now,” said a manager at a private oil refinery, adding that he was considering turning to domestic suppliers for ethanol to blend into gasoline. That is good news for domestic producers, who are already ramping up output on cheaper corn and government subsidies. “We have so much corn. We will do absolutely fine if we don’t import ethanol,” said a manager at a major ethanol producer in China. But analysts said China will probably need to resume imports to meet the government target of 10 percent ethanol content in all gasoline nationwide by 2020. “Demand for fuel ethanol will potentially explode in 2019 and 2020 and we won’t have enough domestic supplies by then. We might have to turn to overseas,” said Michael Mao, an analyst with Zhuochuang, a commodities consultancy based in the Chinese province of Shandong. China said last year the new ethanol mandate would boost industrial demand for corn and help clean up its choking smog. It would mean consumption of around 15 million tonnes of ethanol annually, made from 45 million tonnes of corn, according to Reuters calculations. China’s current ethanol production is around 2.5 million tonnes a year. It is not clear where future imports will come from. A 30 percent duty on ethanol imports previously levied since January 2017 had already slowed a once-booming trade to a trickle. U.S. imports had recently picked up after prices fell enough to be attractive even with the high duties. But the new tariffs will close the arbitrage again, boosting the price of U.S. ethanol to around 6,300 yuan ($1,003.58) per tonne after taxes, on par with domestic prices, market sources said. “There’s not a lot booked past May now and there’s a fear they are not going to book anything forward,” a U.S. ethanol trader said of China. Chicago Board of Trade May ethanol futures fell 2.5 percent or about 4 cents to $1.44 per gallon, the lowest since Feb. 9, as trade resumed after the tariff announcement. The refinery manager said prices in Brazil, the world’s top ethanol producer, are currently too high for exports to China, but could be an option in future.

The four companies were also the biggest drag on the benchmark S&P 500 index. Trump’s comments on Amazon weighed on the equity market but further news on U.S.-China trade later this week is drawing investor interest, said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Co Inc in Boston. “Everybody is bracing for that,” Kleintop said of expected U.S. tariffs on $50 billion to $60 billion worth of annual imports from China that will likely intensify U.S.-China tensions. The Trump administration will unveil by Friday a list of advanced technology Chinese imports targeted for U.S. tariffs to punish Beijing over technology transfer policies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 544.13 points, or 2.26 percent, to 23,558.98, the S&P 500 lost 64.75 points, or 2.45 percent, to 2,576.12 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 192.21 points, or 2.72 percent, to 6,871.24. Shares of Amazon.com Inc fell 4.8 percent after Trump attacked the online retailer over the pricing of its deliveries through the U.S. postal system and promised unspecified changes. “Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money-losing Post Office makes money with Amazon,” Trump tweeted. Emerging market stocks were down 0.17 percent. The dollar fell for a second straight session. The dollar index fell 0.04 percent, with the euro down 0.3 percent to $1.2284. The Japanese yen firmed 0.23 percent at 106.05 per dollar. Oil fell below $68 a barrel, reversing an earlier rally, as a rise in Russian production and concern about a U.S.-China trade spat offset a drop in U.S. drilling activity. U.S. drillers cut seven oil rigs in the week to March 29, bringing the total down to 797, the first decline in three weeks. The rig count is closely watched as an indicator of future U.S. oil output. U.S. crude fell $1.81 to $63.13 per barrel and Brent was last at $67.88, down $1.46 on the day. U.S. Treasury yields rose, with benchmark 10-year notes down 1/32 in price to yield 2.7461 percent. Spot gold added 1.1 percent to $1,338.04 an ounce.

2018-04-02,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - ReNew Power, backed by Goldman Sachs and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), said on Monday it has acquired Ostro Energy Private Ltd, backed by London-based Actis LLP, in one of India’s biggest renewable energy deals. ReNew did not disclose financial details, but two sources familiar with the matter said Ostro was acquired for an enterprise value of about 100 billion rupees ($1.54 billion), which includes debt and equity.  The equity component of about 40 billion Indian rupees  ($614.34 million), was partly funded by CPPIB, and the rest of it was funded by ReNew’s cash, one of the sources said. A total debt of about 60 billion rupees will be taken over by ReNew from Ostro, the source said.   CPPIB said on Monday it has invested an additional $247 million in ReNew Power to support the Sumant Sinha-led company’s acquisition of Ostro, adding to its initial investment of $144 million earlier this year. ReNew - which counts Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Global Environment Fund and JERA Co Inc, a consortium of two of the biggest Japanese utilities - as other investors, is valued at $2 billion, with Goldman holding an over 50 percent stake in the company, according to another source familiar with the matter.  With the acquisition of Ostro, ReNew Power’s total clean energy capacity is over 5.6 gigawatts, 65 percent of which is already operational, the company said in a statement. ReNew has an almost equal number of wind and solar energy assets in terms of installed capacity, while Ostro’s business is mainly wind power.

2018-04-02,"(Adds details) DHAKA, April 2 (Reuters) - Bangladesh Petroleum Corp (BPC) issued an international tender on Monday to import up to 1.52 million tonnes of refined oil products in the second half of 2018, officials said. The state-owned company is seeking 1.1 million tonnes to 1.28 million tonnes of 500ppm sulphur gasoil, 100,000 tonnes of jet fuel and 120,000 to 140,000 tonnes of 180-cst high sulphur fuel oil. The tender closes on April 11 and is valid for 75 days to June 24, 2018. Delivery will be carried out in phases over the second half of 2018, a senior BPC official said. Some volumes will also be imported through separate term deals, he told Reuters, without giving details. BPC resumed issuing tenders for long-term contracts in February 2016 after a 15-year hiatus, during which it negotiated directly with suppliers of fuel products. It wants to move away from direct deals as part of efforts to buy at cheaper rates through international tenders. A shortfall in supplies of natural gas has forced the South Asian country to burn oil, a costlier option, to generate electricity. Bangladesh typically imports around 3.2 million tonnes of diesel and 2.5 million tonnes of fuel oil annually, making it one of the top 10 such importers in the region. Currently, BPC has term contracts with 10 companies for refined oil product imports. Suppliers for Bangladesh’s middle distillates contracts include Kuwait Petroleum Corp, Malaysia’s Petronas, Emirates National Oil Company, Thailand’s PTT, Indonesia’s Bumi Siak Pusako, PetroChina and Unipec. Bangladesh has also signed a 15-year deal with India’s Numaligarh refinery to supply diesel, its first long-term contract with any Indian supplier. BPC also buys 700,000 tonnes of Murban crude from Abu Dhabi National Oil Co annually and another 600,000 tonnes of Arab Light from Saudi Aramco for its only refinery. Bangladesh, with more than 160 million people, also plans to tap currently cheap and plentiful global liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies to fill a domestic supply shortfall.

2018-04-02,"(Adds details, context) BAGHDAD, April 2 (Reuters) - Baker Hughes and General Electric signed a contract with Iraq’s government on Monday to process natural gas extracted alongside crude oil at two fields in southern Iraq, the oil ministry said. The plan was first announced by GE last July and is part of Iraq’s efforts to stop flaring gas associated with oil by 2021. Iraq continues to flare some of this gas because it lacks the facilities to process it into fuel for local consumption or exports. Gas flaring costs nearly $2.5 billion in lost revenue for the government and would be sufficient to meet most of needs for gas‐based power generation, according to the World Bank. The contract with Baker Hughes and GE provides for processing the gas at the Nassiriya, Al Gharraf oilfields. It is the second contract signed by Iraq to process gas associated with oil, after one with U.S. energy firm Orion in January. Iraq’s production of associated gas is expected to grow as the country increases its oil output capacity. The Iraqi cabinet on Sunday approved a plan to raise the nation’s crude oil output capacity to 6.5 million barrels per day by 2022, from about 5 million bpd now. The country is currently producing about 4.4 million bpd, below its capacity, in line with an agreement between the 14-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporters including Russia to cut supply to boost oil prices. OPEC’s second-largest producer, after Saudi Arabia, Iraq plans to award oil and gas exploration and development contracts in 11 new blocks on April 15. The Iraqi government depends on oil and gas sales for about 95 percent of its income.

2018-04-02,"(Adds comments by company officials) By Chen Aizhu and Meng Meng BEIJING, April 2 (Reuters) - China’s Sinopec group, parent of Sinopec Corp, aims to more than double its receiving capacity of liquefied natural gas over the next six years and lift domestic shale gas production by two thirds by 2020. The plans are part of the state energy firm’s efforts for clean fuel production to account for half of its total energy supply by 2023. Sinopec will have 60 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas supply capacity, which includes both imports and domestic production, by 2023, the group said on Monday. It produced 27 bcm of gas in 2017. The group plans to add new receiving facilities for imported LNG along China’s east coast to a total of 26 million tonnes annually by 2023, up from the current 9 million tonnes including the recently launched terminal in Tianjin. “We are going to expand (Qingdao) Dongjiakou terminal to 8 million tonnes and then 10 to 12 million tonnes by phases, same with Tianjin,” Dai Zhaoming, the group’s head of development and planning, told reporters, adding that expansion projects will only need local authorities’ approval. Sinopec will soon formally approve a plan to build a new terminal in eastern Zhejiang province, Dai said. The company has also made new advances in its shale gas business, with a new discovery in the Weirong block in southwestern Sichuan province, said Sun Huanquan, general manager of the group’s oilfield development division. Sun didn’t elaborate on the new find but said it should contribute to the group’s target of 10 billion cubic metres (bcm) of shale gas production by 2020. Sinopec operates China’s largest commercial shale gas field, Fuling in Chongqing in the southwest, and produced just above 6 bcm last year. A top company executive said in February that Sinopec’s shale gas business was almost in the red without government subsidies, illustrating the complex geology despite improving technology and cost-cutting measures. The company also said on Monday that it plans to build 1,000 natural gas filling stations by 2023.

2018-04-02,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - For decades, many Latin America’s oil-producing nations have often shunned investment from foreign firms, instead keeping their vast reserves under the tight control of governments and state-run oil companies. They aimed to protect profits to feed public budgets, but in practice have seen some major breakdowns, as with the corruption scandals and heavy debts at Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA [PDVSA.UL], or the inability of Mexico’s Pemex[PEMX.UL] to conjure the cash and expertise to tap its vast deepwater reserves. Now, an unprecedented wave of free-market energy reforms is gaining traction across the region, setting up a fierce competition to attract billions of dollars in investment from the likes of Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), BP (BP.L) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L). Seven governments this year will combine to hold at least 15 oil and gas auctions, offering a record 1,100 blocks of onshore or offshore acreage, according to interviews with officials and a tally of announced auctions. On Thursday, Brazil’s latest auction collected $2.4 billion in pledges, awarding 22 of 68 regions on offer. “In 2018, countries in the region will host the most licensing rounds in history,” said Pablo Medina, vice president of energy consultancy Welligence.  (For a graphic on Latin American oil auctions, see: tmsnrt.rs/2pw8i6y ) The race for private investment reflects an acknowledgment by many countries that they have neither the cash nor the technology to fully explore and develop their reserves. The embrace of foreign capital in Argentina, Brazil and Ecuador also follows the rise of centrist or right-leaning governments. It also signals a willingness by governments to settle for a smaller cut of the profits - which could be slimmed further by the competition to attract investment as governments offer tax incentives, reduced royalties and other inducements. The glaring exception is Venezuela, where state-run PDVSA remains under the firm control of a leftist government in the throes of an economic and political meltdown. Elsewhere, emerging reforms are giving oil majors and independent producers their pick of some of the region’s richest resources - after being shut out of these markets or waiting years for the right moment to invest. But they also face a risk that governments could shift back to resource nationalization or lose the political will to fully establish market reforms. An oil price drop could also undermine profits from such long-term, expensive projects. “We love this continent. We know it well and now need to make sure we will spend the money wisely,” said Michel Hourcard, senior vice president of development, exploration and production at France’s Total (TOTF.PA), during an industry conference in Houston last month. The ground-breaking regulatory changes in Latin America include tax breaks, reduced royalties, longer contracts, relaxed qualification terms and flexible exploration mandates that allow companies to back out of investments more easily than in the past. Brazil and Colombia also plan to set up permanent offers of areas for exploration and production - similar to those offered by the United States - rather than making them available only in occasional auctions. Ecuador is offering shared-profit agreements that are potentially more lucrative for oil firms than fee-for-service contracts that prevented companies from benefiting from oil price gains. Countries have to present terms attractive enough to draw bidders back to the region, said Julie Wilson, research director of global exploration at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Strong participation by oil majors in recent auctions of exploration and production rights in Mexico and Brazil have heralded a new era by attracting about $110 billion in investment pledges.  Brazil started its effort to lure outside capital two decades ago, but it fell flat after initially enticing more than 100 companies, said Decio Oddone, head of Brazil’s oil regulator. The effort was stymied by too few areas offered for auction, the low quality of some projects and the dominant role of state-run Petrobras.  “Many of those companies did not have the expected success,” Oddone said. Now, Brazil is relaxing bidding rules to encourage local firms and medium-size foreign explorers to participate, joining majors already established in its vast pre-salt region. In Mexico, political risks hampered its most recent auction in March, where bidding was dominated by state-run Pemex. The front-runner in a presidential election set for July has promised to scrutinize the nation’s energy reforms. But some industry leaders believe the country will stay on the path of opening everything from exploration to refining and gasoline retailing. “There is a very clear long-term strategy,” said Jeremy Weir, chief executive of Trading firm Trafigura [TRAFGF.UL]. Broad participation by European, U.S. and Asian firms in several auctions is another a sign a “Mexican revival” is underway, added Fatih Birol, president of the International Energy Agency, a 29-nation group representing most of the world’s top oil consuming nations. Some of Mexico’s and Brazil’s efforts are being copied. Argentina is allowing oil companies to recommend specific areas for they would like to see auctioned, as Mexico did in past rounds; Colombia will open a permanent offer of areas, as Brazil plans to do; and Mexico plans to replicate Brazil’s three-year auction calendar, giving firms more time to plan capital spending before bidding rounds. Some countries are keenly aware of the need to adjust its policies to compete with other nations, according to Juan Carlos Zepeda, head of the nation’s energy regulator National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH). “We are flexible enough to accommodate any of our neighbors’ creativity,” he said.    HIGHER RISK, HIGHER REWARD Compared with Brazil and Mexico, Argentina and Uruguay this year hope to catch investors with offers that hold greater exploration risk - but potentially higher rewards. Argentina officials believe Brazil’s oil-rich pre-salt formation could extend to areas off its Atlantic coast, and in July will release terms of its first offshore auction. That is a big change in a nation that just six year ago expropriated Spanish oil firm Repsol’s stake in state-owned YPF YPFB.BA.  Unlike the rounds for Argentina’s vast Vaca Muerta shale formation - which were led locally by provincial governments - the nation’s central government will run this year’s auctions, standardizing rules and offering better terms.  Uruguay, which holds a third offshore auction in April, is putting up 17 blocks for exploration and production after relaxing the qualification terms and reducing the scope of its mandatory exploration programs. Smaller Latin American countries including Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are in talks with oil companies to offer rights to oilfields or to find partners for their state-run oil firms. Similar energy market openings have blossomed in the past only to fade as governments reverted to resource nationalization or imposed limits to foreign investment. Latin America has see-sawed in prior decades between opening to private investment and returning to oil nationalism.  “It’s part of the cycle: The countries tend to ask (oil companies) for as much as they can,” said Horacio Cuenca, Wood Mackenzie’s director of upstream research for Latin America. They only lower costs and royalties “when available capital starts drying up.” Reporting by Marianna Parraga; Additional reporting by Ernest Scheyder Editing by Gary McWilliams and Brian Thevenot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/latam-oil-reform/analysis-latin-american-nations-compete-for-capital-in-surge-of-oil-auctions-idUKL2N1QR1VX,02 Apr 2018,"For decades, many Latin

2018-04-02,"HOUSTON, April 2(Reuters) - Latin America this year will host the most licensing rounds in its history, opening about 1,100 oil and gas blocks for foreign capital. Mexico started the calendar in January with a round that attracted $93 billion in investment pledges and followed with another securing over $8 billion. In March, Brazil drew $2.4 billion in pledges for offshore areas on top of about $30 billion from an October bidding round. The following is a list of expected bidding rounds in each country this year: A July onshore round will allocate up to 37 areas, followed by nine unconventional blocks, with results due in September. Mexico also hopes to schedule an auction of heavy oil areas in the Gulf’s shallow waters late this year. Brazil will host another large offshore auction this year and the government is preparing the transfer of rights from state-run Petrobras. The country plans a permanent offer of up to 850 onshore and offshore blocks starting in May, a number that could climb to 1,700 areas in 2019. The South American country, which is reducing royalties for bordering and mature fields, has worked hard in recent years to relax its local content rules, an issue seen in the past as a major obstacle on investment. In May, Colombia expects to begin offering up to 25 onshore and offshore blocks in a permanent auction similar to what Brazil is planning, a process that will follow its Sinu-San Jacinto round including 15 areas to be awarded in early April. The country’s regulator also is in talks with holders of nine permits for seismic studies in the Caribbean Sea to convert them into exploration and production contracts. Results of third offshore round could be disclosed in late April, including 17 blocks for exploration and production at its Exclusive Economic Zone. The nation is offering less demanding qualification conditions and mandatory exploration terms, according to the government. State-run Petroleos Paraguayos plans to relaunch in the second quarter an auction to find partners for two exploration and production areas after a failed attempt last year. The blocks - Petropar III and Palo Santo - are part of five areas received by Petropar to be developed in Paraguay’s western zone near the border with Bolivia and Argentina. Argentina will appear late in Latin America’s 2018 auction wave with terms of its first offshore round due in July and results expected in December. The auction, of a mostly unexplored area covering 225,000 kilometers off the Atlantic coast, does not include bidding bonuses, according to the government. Interested firms can propose blocks to be added to the offer.

2018-04-02,"BEIJING, April 2 (Reuters) - Chinese buyers of U.S. ethanol will have to cut their imports because of new higher tariffs but they will have to return to the overseas market to meet the government’s targets for using the fuel, industry participants and analysts said on Monday. China said late on Sunday it will slap an extra 15 percent tariff on ethanol imports from the United States, as part of its response to U.S. duties on aluminium and steel imports. The previous duty was 30 percent. The tariffs, effective Monday, will neutralize the cost savings from importing cheaper U.S. ethanol versus domestic supply, said three sources that participate in the market. Ethanol is an alcohol that is typically produced from corn or sugar and often mixed with gasoline to reduce air pollution from vehicle emissions. “The price difference is gone. We will suspend imports for now,” said a manager at a private oil refinery, adding that he was considering turning to domestic suppliers for ethanol to blend into gasoline. That is good news for domestic producers, who are already ramping up output on cheaper corn and government subsidies. “We have so much corn. We will do absolutely fine if we don’t import ethanol,” said a manager at a major ethanol producer in China. But analysts said China will likely have to resume imports soon, with domestic production unlikely to meet the demand for ethanol needed to meet the government target of having all gasoline nationwide blended with 10 percent ethanol by 2020. “Demand for fuel ethanol will potentially explode in 2019 and 2020 and we won’t have enough domestic supplies by then. We might have to turn to overseas,” said Michael Mao, an analyst with Zhuochuang, a commodities consultancy based in the Chinese province of Shandong. China said last year the new ethanol mandate would boost industrial demand for corn and help clean up its choking smog. It would mean consumption of around 15 million tonnes of ethanol annually, made from 45 million tonnes of corn, according to Reuters calculations. China’s current ethanol production is around 2.5 million tonnes a year. It is not clear where future imports will come from. A 30 percent duty on ethanol imports previously levied since January 2017 had already slowed a once-booming trade to a trickle. U.S. imports had recently picked up after prices fell enough to be attractive even with the high duties. But the new tariffs will close the arbitrage again, pushing up the price of U.S. ethanol to around 6,300 yuan  ($1,003.58) per tonne after taxes, on par with domestic prices, the market sources said. Prices in Brazil, the world’s top ethanol producer, are currently too high for exports to China, said the refinery manager, but they could be an option in future.

2018-04-02,"TOKYO, April 2 (Reuters) - Japan’s Showa Shell Sekiyu KK said on Monday its group refineries would refine 1 percent less crude for the local market in April-June compared with a year ago, in line with their outlook for domestic demand. Showa Shell said its four group refineries would refine 4.73 million kilolitres (327,000 barrels per day) of crude in the second quarter of the year. They have a total capacity of 588,000 bpd. Refining volumes for export markets were not released. The four group refineries are: Showa Shell’s 255,000-bpd Yokkaichi plant, unit Toa Oil’s 70,000-bpd Keihin plant, affiliate Seibu Oil’s 120,000-bpd Yamaguchi refinery and a 143,000-bpd Sodegaura refinery operated by Fuji Oil in which Showa Shell has a 6.6 percent stake. There will be no group refinery maintenance during the three months, a Showa Shell spokeswoman said. Idemitsu Kosan Co has completed the purchase of just under a third of Showa Shell, but its goals for full integration have been delayed indefinitely after opposition from Idemitsu’s founding family.

2018-04-02,"* Spot premiums return to Dec levels; naphtha crack gains * But bull run may not last beyond May * Asia’s supply deficit to shrink sharply in June By Seng Li Peng SINGAPORE, April 2 (Reuters) - Tighter Asian supplies of naphtha have driven price premiums for the petroleum product to more than 12-week highs as cargoes from the West dry up, offsetting a drop in demand caused by a rise in the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as an alternative. But with many Asia facilities that process naphtha - a feedstock for producing petrochemicals used to make plastics - going into maintenance in the next couple of months, the market tightness may be short-lived. Naphtha premiums in South Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia have been rising since early March, with levels last week reaching over $10 a tonne, the highest since December. Asia’s naphtha crack, which describes the profitability of producing the fuel, also trended higher to $91.20 a tonne at the end of March, the highest since Jan. 19 and 17 percent higher from a year earlier. NAF-SIN-CRK Traders said these developments were largely due to fewer eastbound cargoes of naphtha despite strong demand. “Demand is still doing well. Asian steam crackers not undergoing turnarounds are running flat out and there is only so much naphtha that can be substituted with LPG before co-product margins react,” said Michael Dei-Michei, head of research at consulting firm JBC Energy. As for east-bound cargoes, about 1 million tonnes were estimated to have arrived in March from Western suppliers, including in Europe and the Mediterranean, with April arrivals expected at 1.3 million tonnes, traders said. That is down from nearly 2 million tonnes in January and 1.5 million tonnes in February. But the trend may not last beyond May. “Constraints on naphtha supply should ease as we move past maintenance season,” said Dei-Michei. As a result, Asia’s supply deficit is expected to shrink. Japan’s Keiyo, Mitsubishi Chemical, Mitsui Chemicals and Asia’s top naphtha importer, Formosa Petrochemical Corp in Taiwan, are due to start maintenance at their crackers in May or June. In total, seven crackers in Japan were scheduled to undergo maintenance this year versus three units in 2017 while South Korea has turnarounds planned for four crackers compared to two last year. “Asia will need about 1.4 million tonnes of naphtha from the West in May but this will drop to 800,000 tonnes in June,” said a trader who tracks naphtha and LPG. “The naphtha market is at its peak now. The second half of this year will be tough,” he said. Reporting by Seng Li Peng

2018-04-02,"SINGAPORE, April 2 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Monday, lifted by a drop in U.S. drilling activity as well as by expectations that the United States could re-introduce sanctions against Iran. U.S. WTI crude futures were at $65.18 a barrel at 0025 GMT, up 24 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their previous settlement. Brent crude futures were fetching $69.67 per barrel, up 33 cents, or 0.5 percent. Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore, said oil markets remained nervous about “whether or not the U.S. administration will scrap or maintain the fragile nuclear deal with Iran.” Innes said prices were also supported by a weekly report that there was a drop in activity of drilling for new oil production in the United States. U.S. drillers cut seven oil rigs in the week to March 29, bringing the total count down to 797 RIG-OL-USA-BHI, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report last Thursday. It was the first time in three weeks that the rig-count fell. Baker Hughes published its North American rig count report on Thursday, one day earlier than usual, due to the Good Friday holiday on March 30. Oil prices have generally been supported by supply restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia, which started in 2017 in order to rein in oversupply and prop up prices.

2018-04-02,"(Repeats story from March 30 for wider readership with no change to text) * Plans to restart splitter, aromatics plant in June-July * To buy condensate, fuel oil and mixed xylenes * State investors take 90 pct share in complex By Florence Tan and Chen Aizhu SINGAPORE/BEIJING, March 30 (Reuters) - China’s Fuhaichuang, formerly known as Dragon Aromatics, plans to restart its refining-petrochemical complex in eastern Fujian as early as June after halting operations for three years, four sources with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. The re-opening of one of China’s biggest petrochemical plants will add to demand for raw materials like condensate, fuel oil and mixed xylenes and will come amid increasing global use of the mainly polyester fibres it will produce. The complex, an important addition to the synthetic textiles supply chain if started, has been shut since April 2015 after a fire, the second in less than two years, raised safety concerns and the need for fresh funds for repairs. The cost of the complex was previously tagged at $3 billion, before the fires. reut.rs/2pOolM1 The sources did not have an amount for the cost of repairs. Before the extended shutdown, the plant in Zhangzhou, on the east coast of China, included a 90,000-barrels-per-day (bpd) condensate splitter, a 3.2-million-tonnes-per-year (tpy) hydrocracker and two 800,000-tpy paraxylene plants. The company wants to start operations by June or July, the sources said, adding that government approval of the revamp is still required. Multiple calls to the offices of Fujian Petrochemical Group, the main new shareholder in the project, went unanswered. Fuhaichuang is now 90 percent owned by Fuhua Gulei Petrochemical Co Ltd, while Dragon Aromatics, owned by Taiwan’s Xianglu Group, retained a 10 percent share, one of the sources said. Fuhua Gulei is, in turn, owned by the provincial government-backed Fujian Petrochemical Group and a local firm in Zhangzhou.  In October 2017 Fuhua Gulei registered a joint venture with the Taiwanese company to manage and operate the complex, according to Fujian Petrochemical Group’s website. Repairs to the fire damage are almost complete and the splitter has been expanded to 110,000 bpd, the source said. The splitter processes condensate into naphtha, which is then used to produce paraxylene, a chemical used in making polyester fibre and plastics. Fuhaichuang is seeking to buy condensate, fuel oil and mixed xylenes for the plant’s restart, the sources said. “Dragon was out in the market seeking condensate and fuel oil, but it’s not clear if the new management has got that much expertise running the plant,” said one of the sources. Dragon Aromatics’ splitter used to run mostly on Iranian South Pars condensate but Iran has reduced exports since late last year after selling excess supplies in storage and as it started up its own new splitters.
