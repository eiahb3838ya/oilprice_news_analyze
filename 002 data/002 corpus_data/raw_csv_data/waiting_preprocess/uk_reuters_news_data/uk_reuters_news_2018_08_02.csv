2018-08-02,"DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - California and 18 other U.S. states promised on Thursday to fight a Trump administration proposal to weaken fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks and force states into line, arguing the United States has an obligation to protect the environment for future generations. The administration billed the proposed rollback from Obama-era fuel efficiency standards as a way to help car companies and lower vehicle prices for consumers, but critics said the plan would accelerate climate change and increase fuel prices. By seeking to strip California of its authority to set its own strict vehicle emissions standards, the proposal also opens new questions about the limits of federal powers over states. The 19 states, and Washington D.C, announced they would sue to halt the proposed rollback, touching off what will likely be a heated legal showdown, possibly making it to the Supreme Court. It could also become a polarizing issue in elections in November. “The Trump Administration has launched a brazen attack, no matter how it is cloaked, on our nation’s Clean Car Standards,” said California’s attorney general, Xavier Becerra. California “will use every legal tool at its disposal” to defend strict standards, he said in a statement. Many U.S. states have adopted California’s emission rules, and together they make up about one third of the U.S. auto market - making the stakes for the autos industry enormous.   The administration said the proposed rollback would mean billions of dollars in regulatory savings for car manufacturers. But the industry is pushing for a negotiated settlement between states and the administration to lift uncertainty over the kinds of cars and trucks it will need to produce for the American market in the coming years.  The proposal to roll back anti-pollution efforts is in line with President Donald Trump’s decision last year to abandon the 2015 Paris Agreement, under which countries agreed to take steps to mitigate global warming. It also dovetails with the Republican president’s broader effort to unwind green regulation, much of it enacted by Democratic former President Barack Obama’s administration. The proposal from the U.S. Transportation Department and Environmental Protection Agency would freeze fuel efficiency standards at 2020 levels through 2026, and require dramatically fewer electric vehicles as more people continue to drive gasoline-powered vehicles. The administration said the freeze would boost U.S. oil consumption by about 500,000 barrels of oil a day by the 2030s, and argued it would prevent up to 1,000 traffic fatalities per year by reducing the price of new vehicles and so prompting people to buy newer, safer vehicles more quickly. “Unless the Obama administration’s punishing standards are changed, consumer choice will be limited and the cost of vehicles will skyrocket, said Republican Senator John Barrasso.  “Americans shouldn’t be denied the ability to purchase a car or truck that meets their needs.”  Environmental groups criticized the assertion about reducing crash deaths, and said the proposal would drive up gasoline prices, increase asthma-inducing smog, and reverse one of the most significant steps Washington has taken to curb climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions.  “The clean car standards are already saving our families billions at the pump, supporting nearly 300,000 American jobs, and cleaning up dangerous tailpipe pollution,” said Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “We need to speed up that progress, not slide backward.” The administration must gather feedback on the proposal before it is finalized, a process that could take months and that could be further delayed by lawsuits. The Transportation Department says the proposal would shrink regulatory costs for automakers by $319 billion through 2029, reducing by more than $60 billion what General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) each would have been expected to spend to comply with the Obama-era rules. Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) would save $34 billion and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) $20 billion.  General Motors said in a statement that it wants to work “with all parties to achieve one national 50-state program,” adding it was committed to “continually improving fuel economy and our commitment to an all-electric future.” The administration also contends that hiking U.S. oil consumption by 2 to 3 percent over forecast levels would have a minimal impact on the environment, boosting global average temperature by just “3/1000th of a degree Celsius by 2100.”     Trump’s decision to challenge California’s authority to regulate vehicle emissions upends decades of federal policy that allowed the most populous and richest U.S. state to combat air pollution that particularly afflicts Los Angeles. The Trump administration proposal said California’s zero emission vehicle rules, adopted by nine other states, are “technologically infeasible.”  “California will fight this stupidity in every conceivable way possible,” Governor Edmund “Jerry” Brown, a Democrat, said in a statement.          Democrats hope to make any rollback of the emissions rules a key part of November’s midterm elections, when they will try to regain control of one or both chambers of Congress.     Republicans in states with links to the auto industry may counter that the administration is working to ensure automakers can make more profitable, larger vehicles, including fuel-thirsty pickups and SUVs. Some middle ground might be possible. Acting EPA chief Andrew Wheeler said on Wednesday he would welcome a deal between the industry and states.    Bill Wehrum, an assistant EPA administrator, told reporters on Thursday that many things had changed, including a drop in fuel prices, since the efficiency rules were last set six years ago. He said gas prices are “at historically low levels and that changes driving habits, that changes the kind of cars and trucks that people want to buy.” Federal and California officials would soon meet about the proposal, Wehrum said, adding, “All of us want one national program. We are going to try to work it out.” Becerra said California is “ready and willing” to talk with Trump administration regulators, but that previous talks have not been fruitful.

2018-08-02,"(Kate Gordon is a non-resident Fellow at the Columbia Center on Global Energy Policy, Senior Advisor to the Paulson Institute, and the author of “Risky Business: The Economic Risks of Climate Change in the United States.” The opinions expressed here are her own) By Kate Gordon Aug 2 (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday took a giant step backward on transportation innovation by issuing a proposal to freeze federal rules requiring automakers to design more efficient, cleaner-running cars. In April, then-Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt called the current standards “too high” and said they did not “comport with reality.” But globally, these standards have helped American automakers to remain competitive as other countries – particularly China – embrace the transition to a low-carbon economy. By reversing course on fuel-efficiency regulations, the United States is encouraging automakers to build outdated vehicles in a globally-evolving market – ceding market leadership to China in the process. Current federal vehicle standards require automakers to produce passenger vehicles that meet specific mileage-per-gallon and carbon-emissions standards. The administration’s proposal lays out eight possible scenarios for scaling back the standards, with the preferred option being to freeze them at 2020 levels through 2026. Whether from a market, safety, or environmental perspective, this is misguided. Historically, federal regulation of the U.S. auto industry has led to better vehicles – just look at seat belts, safety brakes, and glass standards for windshields, all of which led to the development of safer cars that have become the global standard over the past half century. Looking forward, it’s clear that low- or no-carbon vehicles will dominate our global transportation future. The vehicle emission rules provide incentives for U.S. automakers to produce and sell low-carbon vehicles, and electric vehicles in particular, as these are both cleaner and more efficient than gas-powered cars and trucks. Companies can manufacture these vehicles, but can also meet the standards by purchasing credits from other auto companies that have more mature EV or alternative-fuel vehicle lines. The rules are flexible, but they’re also critical to maintaining U.S. leadership on EV manufacturing. According to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI), “policy support is playing a major role in developing and deploying EVs” in both the United States and China, which is why the two countries lead the world in EV registrations today. Rolling back federal rules will relieve short-term pressure for manufacturers to invest in electric vehicles, and could have significant long-term impacts for the United States. Last year, global EV sales surpassed the one million mark for the first time. Battery pack prices dropped 65 percent from 2013 through 2017, a trend that will only accelerate as global demand for EVs rises. China recently joined the UK, France, Norway and India in pledging to phase out the use of gas-powered vehicles in the coming decades. Even Exxon, BP and OPEC project surging demand for electric vehicles out to 2040, and the most aggressive market outlook shows EVs making up over 30 percent of the entire global vehicle fleet by 2040. Automakers are reading the tea leaves. Globally, they’ve announced $150 billion in investments to get 13 million more electric vehicles on the world’s roads by around 2025. The United States is making a strong showing on EVs, but China leads the pack. In 2017, half of global EV production took place in China, where demand for electric vehicles is expected to triple by 2022. The government is offering generous incentives to scale up EV production and sales. More important, China has offered generous terms to international automakers looking to establish themselves in the country. It’s working: American companies like Ford and General Motors have announced hefty investments in China’s EV market, and Ford’s chairman is on the record as saying that “China will lead the world in EV development.” The United States accounted for 17 percent of global production of electric vehicles in 2017, putting it in second place behind China. While domestic policies are spurring significant growth in the EV market, there is also increasing consumer demand. Recent data from AAA shows that one in five U.S. drivers will likely go electric when buying their next car, and drivers are becoming less concerned about running out of battery charge while driving EVs. Ford, GM and Toyota are all adapting their production accordingly, indicative of the larger global shift toward EVs. But of the top 20 electric vehicle manufacturers, nine have headquarters in China, while only three are based in the United States. China accounts for 40 percent of global investment in EVs and projections show that the country will lead the market through 2040. China’s potential dominance in the changing auto sector matters. Auto manufacturing constitutes about three percent of U.S. GDP, and accounts for the most jobs of any manufacturing sector. Losing these jobs, and this market share, to another country is no laughing matter, especially in the auto-heavy Midwest and Southeast states: in Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee, auto industry jobs make up 10 percent or more of the entire state labor force. Freezing fuel efficiency standards at this critical juncture, when momentum is picking up and billions of dollars in investments are following suit, would cede the growing EV market to China and create unnecessary regulatory uncertainty for automakers in the United States. The Trump administration should preserve the current standards or risk encouraging American automakers to build the cars of the past in an increasingly electric future.

2018-08-02,"(Adds details from earnings release) By Liz Hampton HOUSTON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Oil and gas producer EOG Resources Inc on Thursday reported sharply higher second-quarter profit, but missed Wall Street per-share estimates, earning $1.20 compared with analysts’ expectations for $1.23. EOG grew its total crude production by 15 percent from a year ago to a company record of 384,600 barrels per day, pushing profit for the quarter to $696.7 million from $23.1 million a year earlier. The company said it was targeting 18 percent growth in its crude production for the year. U.S. producers are benefiting from a bump in oil activity, as benchmark U.S. crude futures have climbed almost 40 percent in the past year to around $70 a barrel. EOG said it increased crude derivative contracts during the second quarter, and received an average crude and condensate price of $67.91, up from $47.51 a year ago. Results at rivals including Devon Energy Corp and Anadarko Petroleum Corp took a hit during the quarter because of the settlement of commodity derivatives. Companies hedged production at about $55 a barrel, losing out on revenue gains from market prices that rose above $70 a barrel last quarter. EOG also said it increased its estimated resource potential in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin oil field to 2.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. That basin is now its third largest asset, the company said. EOG said it would operate a two-rig program in the Powder River Basin during 2018 and would expand its drilling activity next year. It is targeting well costs between $4.5 million and $6.1 million per well. The company reported net operating revenues of $4.24 billion, up from $2.61 billion a year ago. Anadarko said this week it had grown its footprint in the Powder River Basin to 300,000 acres (121,400 hectares) and had begun an appraisal effort for the development of oil production there.

2018-08-02,"(Adds comment by fire marshal, byline, NEW YORK dateline) By Gary McWilliams and Scott DiSavino HOUSTON/NEW YORK, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Authorities on Thursday were investigating what caused a fire and a series of natural gas pipeline explosions in Midland County, Texas, that sent seven people to hospital and shut down five lines before being extinguished. Workers from two companies with adjacent pipelines were sent to the area Wednesday morning because of an underground gas leak when one pipeline caught fire and exploded, said Midland County Fire Marshal Dale Little, who is conducting an investigation. The blast affected lines that furnish gas processing plants in the area but outages were not significantly impacting pricing or supplies, analysts said. Pipelines operated by Kinder Morgan Inc and Navitas Midstream Partners LLC both suffered damage, said Little. No cause for the blast has yet been determined. Navitas Chief Operating Officer Bryan Neskora said in a statement that company employees were among the injured. Five workers with critical injuries were treated at the burns unit of the University Medical Center in Lubbock, Texas. One man remained in critical condition and three others were upgraded to serious condition, all with burn injuries, medical center spokesman Eric Finley said on Thursday. A fifth worker was released after treatment. Two firefighters who were at the site when the explosions occurred also were taken to hospital on Wednesday for treatment of burns, said Elana Ladd, public information officer for the city of Midland. Ladd said the explosions occurred just outside Midland on a rural road. Oil and gas pipelines crisscross Midland County, which is located in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield. The explosions affected five pipelines that share a transit channel and which were all shut in by operators, a Midland city official said on Wednesday. Marty Baeza, a Fort Stockton, Texas, oilfield worker who was at a site about a half mile (0.8 km) from the explosion, said the blast shook the water-treatment unit where he was working. “It felt like someone had bumped us,” said Baeza. A large fireball lit up the sky for about five minutes, and firefighters arrived quickly, he said. Kinder Morgan’s El Paso Natural Gas (EPNG) line was damaged but service impacts were expected to be minimal, spokeswoman Sara Hughes said in an email. The company believes the problem started with a nearby pipeline. “There was a third-party pipeline involved that also experienced a failure, and preliminary indications are that the third-party line failure occurred before the EPNG line failure,” Hughes said. The outage on the EPNG line will affect less than 10 million cubic feet per day of flows, estimated Joseph Bernardi, research analyst, natural gas at energy data provider Genscape. Gas prices at the Waha NG-WAH-WTX-SN hub, in the Permian Basin, increased by 31 cents, or about 14 percent, at midday on Thursday to $2.54 per million British thermal units. Tyler Jubert, an energy analyst at S&P Global Platts, said the relatively small volumes affected should have little influence on hub prices. Some of Thursday’s gain could be attributed to strong demand in the West where temperatures are hotter than normal.

2018-08-02,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - An intensifying trade dispute between the United States and China weighed on global stocks and bond yields on Thursday, but a rise in Apple shares took its valuation above a record $1 trillion and helped major U.S. indexes close in positive territory. In midday trading, Apple Inc became the first publicly traded company with a market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion. That led a rebound in technology stocks that helped key U.S. indexes pare earlier losses to turn positive.  “They get the blue ribbon,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. “If you look at a trillion dollars, that’s about 5 percent of the U.S. economy. On the other hand, if you look at the stock relative to the market its (price-to-earnings ratio) is less, it still has a decent growth rate.” The tech company’s stock jumped more than 3.3 percent to as high as $208.38, bringing its gain to about 9 percent since Tuesday when it reported quarterly results that beat expectations and said it bought back $20 billion of its own shares. The Nasdaq, Dow and benchmark S&P indexes had opened lower, but began to turn positive as the advance in Apple shares helped take the focus away from the trade dispute. The Dow, which was the worst performer of the three indexes, was the only one to end lower.  On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 7.66 points, or 0.03 percent, to 25,326.16, the S&P 500 gained 13.86 points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,827.22 and the Nasdaq Composite added 95.40 points, or 1.24 percent, to 7,802.69. Despite the day’s reprieve for Wall Street, concerns remained over the U.S.-China trade spat, which intensified on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump raised pressure on China by proposing a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.  China on Thursday urged the United States to “calm down,” but market participants remained unnerved.  MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.75 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.85 percent. Germany’s blue-chip index DAX, which is seen as a trade war proxy, fell 1.5 percent while the broader pan-European STOXX 600 was down about 0.8 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed down 1.6 percent, dragged lower by a 1.8 percent fall in Chinese H-shares.   Benchmark U.S. government bond yields dipped as the market sought safe-haven debt in Treasuries amid the trade dispute. [US/] U.S. yields, however, moved in narrow ranges ahead of Friday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for July. “The market was pretty much back and forth. We’re just waiting for tomorrow’s payrolls,” said Tom Simons, money market economist at Jefferies in New York. Euro zone government bond yields dipped, and borrowing costs in Germany and France pulled back from seven-week highs. Gold prices inched downward after Fed’s upbeat assessment of the economy on Wednesday to the lowest price in more than a year as the dollar, which typically has an inverse relationship with gold, rose.  Spot gold dropped 0.6 percent to $1,208.72 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.87 percent to $1,216.90 an ounce. The dollar index rose 0.56 percent, with the euro down 0.61 percent to $1.1587. Oil prices strengthened after an industry report suggested U.S. crude stockpiles would soon begin to decline again after a surprise rise in the latest week. Traders said prices rallied when industry information provider Genscape reported crude inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude, dropped 1.1 million barrels since Friday, July 27.

2018-08-02,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States believes Iran has started carrying out naval exercises in the Gulf, apparently moving up the timing of annual drills amid heightened tensions with Washington, U.S. officials told Reuters on Thursday. One U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said possibly more than 100 vessels were involved in the drills, including small boats. A second official expected the drill could be wrapped up this week. Iran has been furious over U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of an international nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions on Tehran. Senior Iranian officials have  warned the country would not easily yield to a renewed U.S. campaign to strangle Iran’s vital oil exports. The U.S. military’s Central Command on Wednesday confirmed it has seen an increase in Iranian naval activity, including in the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic waterway for oil shipments that Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have threatened to block. “We are monitoring it closely, and will continue to work with our partners to ensure freedom of navigation and free flow of commerce in international waterways,” said Navy Captain Bill Urban, the chief spokesman at Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East. Central Command did not update its guidance on Thursday. A third official said the Iranian naval operations did not appear to be affecting commercial maritime activity.  U.S. officials, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said the drills appeared designed to send a message to Washington, which is intensifying its economic and diplomatic pressure on Tehran but so far stopping short of using the U.S. military to more aggressively counter Iran and its proxies. But Iran did not appear interested in drawing attention to them. Iranian authorities have yet to comment on them and several officials contacted by Reuters declined to comment. Trump’s policies are already putting significant pressure on the Iranian economy, although U.S. intelligence suggests they may ultimately rally Iranians against the United States and strengthen Iran’s hardline rulers, officials say. Iran’s currency plumbed new depths this week ahead of Aug. 7, when Washington is due to reimpose a first lot of sanctions following Trump’s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal. Protests have broken out in Iran since the beginning of the year over high prices, water shortage, power cuts and alleged corruption. On Tuesday, hundreds of people rallied in cities including Isfahan, Karaj, Shiraz and Ahvaz to protest high inflation caused in part by the weak rial.

2018-08-02,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices strengthened Thursday, with U.S. crude gaining nearly 2 percent after traders saw an industry report suggesting domestic crude stockpiles would soon decline again after a surprise rise in the latest week. Traders said prices rallied early when industry information provider Genscape reported that crude inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude, dropped 1.1 million barrels since Friday, July 27.  On Wednesday, prices sank when the U.S. government reported that in the prior week, total U.S. inventories rose 3.8 million barrels, while supplies at Cushing fell 1.3 million barrels. [EIA/S] “There’s an expectation that the build from this week will be gone next week,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. He also noted U.S. monthly production figures fell in May. Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled up $1.06, or 1.5 percent at $73.45 a barrel. U.S. crude CLc1 rose $1.30, or 1.9 percent, to $68.96 a barrel. Before the Genscape report sparked a rally, futures fell early on concerns about oversupply.  Saudi Arabia, Russia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have increased production to help to compensate for an anticipated shortfall in Iranian crude supplies once U.S. sanctions take effect.   The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and partners including Russia had cut output to rebalance supply and demand.  “Oil is holding up reasonably well ... A lot of this is the risk premium priced in for Iran and when do we start seeing an impact on supply there,” ING commodities strategist Warren Patterson said. “At the moment, there is a mismatch in timing, where there is increasing OPEC supply and yet we’re not seeing a significant reduction in Iranian supply,” Patterson said. U.S. officials told Reuters on Wednesday that they believe Iran is preparing to carry out a major exercise in the Gulf, apparently moving up the timing due to heightened tensions. U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of an international nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions on Iran has angered Tehran. “There are a lot of escalation points that could occur very quickly and that worries me,” Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Ayers Alliance in Sydney, said. Worries about the possible loss of Iranian supply are being somewhat offset by concerns that global trade tensions could slow economic growth and crimp energy demand. Trump has turned up pressure on China for trade concessions by proposing a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese imports. China has said it will retaliate.  “It is almost certain that China will impose additional duties on oil and refined products imported from the U.S. if the Trump administration implements additional tariffs on the next tranche of Chinese goods. This could severely dent the competitiveness of U.S. oil and derivatives in the Chinese market,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy.

2018-08-02,"ROME (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Thursday met the mayor at the centre of a dispute threatening to delay work on the 4.5 billion euro (4.01 billion pounds)Trans Adriatic Pipeline but made no commitment about changing the project. Conte said he met Marco Poti, mayor of Melendugno, a seaside resort on Italy’s heel where the TAP pipeline will land, together with a team of legal and technical experts to discuss what he called “critical aspects” of the pipeline. “I assured them the government will conduct an in-depth assessment of the whole dossier,” Conte said after the meeting, adding however that legal commitments had already been made by the previous centre-left administration. Conte also clarified to Poti that diversifying Italy’s energy supplies remains a “strategic” goal, a government source said. Grassroots opposition to the project has revolved mainly around alleged environment risks and the fear the pipeline could discourage tourism. The mayor, who has argued that the tourism-oriented area he represents is totally unsuitable as the landing point of the pipeline, said Conte had told him the project could be scrapped if the government finds any procedural irregularities. He said he was pleased to note a “different political climate, compared with the previous government”. TAP, the last leg of the $40 billion Southern Gas Corridor that will bring Azeri gas to Italy, is due to start pumping gas in 2020 but the local opposition has raised concern that work at the Italian end may not be completed in time. The pipeline is viewed as strategic by the European Union as it moves to wean itself off its dependency on Russian gas. In July, Italian President Sergio Mattarella confirmed Italy was committed to TAP. At a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday, Conte said he was aware of the strategic nature of the pipeline and would visit the local community and mayor to seek a solution. The Trump administration is keen to see the pipeline completed on time. TAP shareholders are BP, Socar, Snam, Fluxys, Enagas and Axpo.

BR Distribuidora, as the company is known, posted net income of 263 million reais  ($70.02 million), nearly quadruple the year-ago figure but below a consensus estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters of 365.87 million reais. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) - a common gauge of operational profitability - totaled 508 million reais in the period, below a consensus estimate of 689.62 million reais but up 5.6 percent above its EBITDA in the same period last year. “The effect of the strike can be summarized as an adjustment in diesel inventories, generating a loss of about 200 million reais,” the company said. In an earnings call on Thursday, an executive at the company said it was in the final phase of contracting a financial advisor for adopting a new model for its convenience stores, called “BR Mania,” which could include seeking a partner. Petrobras raked in north of 5 billion reais late last year when it floated a 30 percent stake in the unit as part of a bid to reduce the heftiest debt load among oil majors worldwide.

In midday trading, Apple Inc became the first publicly traded company with a market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion. That led a rebound in technology stocks that helped key U.S. indexes pare earlier losses to turn positive. “It’s certainly a tremendous achievement to create a company with a $1 trillion market cap,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. Still, he said, “it’s just a number.” The tech company’s stock jumped 2.8 percent to as high as $207.05, bringing its gain to about 9 percent since Tuesday when it reported quarterly results that beat expectations and said it bought back $20 billion of its own shares. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 36.87 points, or 0.15 percent, to 25,296.95, the S&P 500 gained 9.06 points, or 0.32 percent, to 2,822.42 and the Nasdaq Composite added 69.55 points, or 0.9 percent, to 7,776.84. The Nasdaq and benchmark S&P indexes had opened lower, but began to turn positive as the advance in Apple shares took the focus away from the trade dispute. Still, concerns remained over the U.S.-China trade spat, which intensified on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump raised pressure on China by proposing a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. China on Thursday urged the United States to “calm down,” but market participants remained unnerved. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.75 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.85 percent. Germany’s blue-chip index DAX, which is seen as a trade war proxy, fell 1.5 percent while the broader pan-European STOXX 600 was down about 0.8 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.6 percent down, dragged down by a 1.8 percent fall in Chinese H-shares. Benchmark U.S. government bond yields edged lower as the market sought safe-haven debt in Treasuries amid the trade dispute. “We’re in risk-off mode after the back and forth between China and the U.S. on tariffs,” said Priya Misra, head of global rates strategy at TD Securities in New York. “You’re already seeing (trade tension) affect investment decisions globally, so it is a growth concern.” Euro zone government bond yields dipped, and borrowing costs in Germany and France pulled back from seven-week highs. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged as expected, characterizing the U.S. economy as strong and staying on track to increase borrowing costs in September and likely again in December. Gold prices held steady on the news after falling 11 percent since April to its lowest in a year. Spot gold dropped 0.1 percent to $1,214.60 an ounce.

2018-08-02," (The Aug. 1 story was corrected to place Yemen on the eastern side of Bab al-Mandeb strait, not to its south) JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel would deploy its military if Iran were to try to block the Bab al-Mandeb strait that links the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday. Last week, Saudi Arabia said it was suspending oil shipments through the strait, on the main sea route from the Middle East to Europe, after Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthis attacked two ships in the waterway. Saudi Arabia and Iran are in a three-year-old proxy war in Yemen, which lies on the eastern side of Bab al-Mandeb. Yemen’s Houthis, who have previously threatened to block the strait, said last week they had the naval capability to hit Saudi ports and other Red Sea targets.  Iran has not threatened to block Bab al-Mandeb but has said it would block the Strait of Hormuz, at the mouth of the Gulf, if it were prevented from exporting its own oil. “If Iran will try to block the straits of Bab al-Mandeb, I am certain that it will find itself confronting an international coalition that will be determined to prevent this, and this coalition will also include all of Israel’s military branches,” Netanyahu said at a passing out parade for new naval officers in Haifa. Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said in a separate speech at the event that Israel had “recently heard of threats to harm Israeli ships in the Red Sea.” He gave no further details.  Ships bound for Israel, mainly from Asia, pass through the waterway to Eilat, or continue through the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean Sea. Ships bound for Jordan’s Aqaba port and for some Saudi destinations must also pass through the strait. Bab al-Mandeb is 29 km (18 miles) wide, making hundreds of ships potentially an easy target. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said an estimated 4.8 million barrels per day of crude oil and products flowed through it in 2016. Israel has attacked Iranian forces in Syria and has insisted that they leave Syria completely. They have withdrawn to a distance of 85 km (53 miles) from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, Russia’s special envoy to Syria said on Wednesday.

2018-08-02,"BARCELONA, Aug 2 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The Green Climate Fund, set up to channel billions of dollars to help developing nations tackle climate change, must operate more efficiently, with greater political attention needed to make that happen, the United Nations’ climate chief said on Thursday. The fund’s July board meeting at its South Korean base - which ended in disarray after its executive director resigned and the board failed to reach key decisions - was “a cause of concern”, Patricia Espinosa said in an interview. “We need to overcome... the obstacles that did not allow the board to deliver on the very important work it had to conclude,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The fund is independent, although it was established by the U.N. climate talks as a key vehicle for climate finance. Espinosa said she did not have a specific formula or suggestions for its reform. “What I think is indispensable is to get a higher level of attention, a political level of attention, to make this institution work,” she said, urging finance ministries to get involved in the discussions. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) has been beset by arguments between rich and poor nations about how and where to invest the $10.3 billion it was promised by wealthy governments in 2014. Tensions have also risen since U.S. President Donald Trump - who plans to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord - indicated he would not deliver a remaining $2 billion of $3 billion promised to the GCF by his predecessor. The fund’s deputy executive director, Javier Manzanares, said on Wednesday the last board meeting had been “somewhat of a setback”. “But GCF still has a huge role to play, and we are already delivering,” he told Pacific government officials in Micronesia. So far, the GCF has committed $3.7 billion to 76 projects - from boosting energy efficiency in Brazilian cities to helping Maldives islanders manage water shortages in a warmer world. Observers have suggested reducing the number of GCF board members - now 24 - and devolving to its secretariat decisions on which projects should be funded. Ben Bartle, a senior climate finance expert with consultancy E Co., said the fund was at a “critical juncture” where it needed to streamline its processes, become more transparent, and disburse money for projects faster. Espinosa, who heads the U.N. climate change secretariat, said the fund - which began making investment decisions only in 2015 - was still very young. It is also grappling with an innovative decision-making model that gives developed and developing countries an equal say, she added. But she expressed high hopes it would “get back to work as soon as possible” at its next meeting in October. The board should review the pipeline of projects it did not consider in July, she added, and define a process to start replenishing its coffers - another area of controversy. Should the fund not advance on those issues before the next annual U.N. climate conference in December, where countries are due to agree guidelines to implement the Paris Agreement, “it will impact on the general atmosphere”, she said. Assuring developing states they will get the climate change funding they need to reduce emissions and adapt to more extreme weather and rising seas in line with their national plans “is a very central element” of the Paris pact, said Espinosa. Rich governments have promised to mobilise $100 billion per year in climate finance for vulnerable countries by 2020, but have not set out a clear pathway to reach that goal. Climate financing from the world’s six largest multilateral development banks - a major source of funding - rose to $35.2 billion in 2017, up 28 percent on 2016, they said in June. The same projects attracted an additional $51.7 billion from other sources of financing last year, they noted. Espinosa said the negative messages from the Trump administration on the U.N. climate change process, and its unwillingness to contribute money, were an element “that is not sending the signals to build up the trust that we need”. But other countries had stayed committed to the global accord because it was in their own interests, she said. ""It's a question of how valuable is this agreement for the future of humanity,"" she said. (Reporting by Megan Rowling @meganrowling. Editing by Robert Carmichael.

2018-08-02,"Aug 2 (Reuters) - FMC Corp, which is spinning off its lithium division as a publicly traded company later this year, said on Thursday that prices for the light metal continue to rise on strong demand from electric vehicle battery makers. There are growing worries about oversupply in the lithium sector, with several new production facilities under construction around the globe. Philadelphia-based FMC on Wednesday posted a better-than-expected second-quarter profit, helped in part by a 20 percent increase in sales of lithium hydroxide and carbonate, the two most common derivations of lithium used by battery suppliers for Tesla Inc and others. “We are seeing sequential pricing as well as very strong year-on-year pricing,” FMC Chief Executive Pierre Brondeau said on a conference call with investors. Spot market prices in China for lithium have plunged this year due in part to the oversupply concerns, though the Chinese spot market is relatively small. FMC, like competitor Albemarle Corp, has annual contracts with customers that it renegotiates annually. The company is able to charge more under those contracts as demand rises for the metal, a critical battery component, Brondeau said. FMC, which also produces agricultural chemicals, plans to spin off its lithium division in an initial public offering in October under the “Livent Corp” name. For 2018, FMC expects lithium sales of $430 million to $460 million, in what would be at least a 20 percent increase from last year, though executives noted that not all of that is spread out equally among all quarters. FMC’s main lithium production facility is in Argentina, where the country’s peso currency has been dropping in value to the U.S. dollar this year due in part to weakness in emerging markets and uncertainty about the local economy. That devaluation actually boosted exports from the lithium division in the second quarter, Brondeau said. Shares of FMC fell 2.6 percent to $85.99 on Thursday as U.S. markets were mixed.

2018-08-02,"LONDON, Aug 2 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Rising temperatures in a warming world will cost poor countries tens of billions of dollars annually as they are less able to keep their workers cool, analysts said on Thursday. Over the next 30 years, manual labourers in the agriculture, mining, oil and gas, and manufacturing sectors - which are the most prevalent in emerging economies - will be hardest hit by higher temperatures, said risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft. By examining energy infrastructure with temperature data and projected urban population growth, researchers said workers in Africa and Asia would be most affected by rising heat. “That means workers are missing days because they suffer from heat stress, or their physical capacity to undertake physical activity is diminished because of those high temperatures,” said Richard Hewston, head of the environment and climate change programme at Verisk Maplecroft. “With lower labour capacity, productivity dips off and subsequently you have ripple effects through the sectors with the highest amount of manual labour,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. This drop in productivity equates to an annual loss of $78 billion a year in South East Asia, and nearly $10 billion in West Africa, the consultancy’s report said. Rapid urbanisation in these emerging economies will also strain energy needs, and the demand for cooling - such as air-conditioning - will soar as temperatures rise resulting in frequent power outages, it said. About 1.1 billion people in Asia, Africa and Latin America are at risk from a lack of air conditioning and refrigeration to keep them cool and to preserve food and medicines as temperatures rise, says global group Sustainable Energy for All. “Even modest amounts of climate change will be impactful so that forces us to do something about it,” Sam Fankhauser, director of the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics, said of the Verisk Maplecroft study. “We need to start thinking about how we build our buildings, shading, airflows, air-conditioning, green roofs, how we might adjust our behaviour, and how we design our cities,” said Fankhauser, who was not involved in the report. Two-thirds of the world’s population will live in cities by 2050, with that boom concentrated in three countries - India, China and Nigeria - according to United Nations estimates released in May. The World Health Organization has said heat stress, linked to climate change, is likely to cause 38,000 extra deaths a year worldwide between 2030 and 2050. In 2015, countries signing the Paris Agreement set a goal of limiting a rise in average world surface temperatures to ""well below"" 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times, while ""pursuing efforts"" to limit rising temperatures to 1.5C (2.7F).

2018-08-02,"(Adds detail, analyst comment, updates prices) MOSCOW, Aug 2 (Reuters) - The Russian rouble slumped towards two-week lows on Thursday after U.S. senators proposed sanctions on Russia’s new sovereign debt. In an attempt to raise pressure on Russia, particularly in response to Moscow’s alleged meddling in U.S. elections, the new bill called for “sanctions with respect to transactions relating to new sovereign debt of the Russian Federation”. Mosow has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing or interferring in the U.S. elections. The rouble fell to 63.55 versus the dollar shortly after the news of the proposed sanctions, its weakest since June 20, sliding from the levels of around 62.21 it hovered at before the new bill announcement. Concerns about sanctions on Russian debt have been dominating markets for months but Washington has so far has fallen short of penalties against government debt. Russian treasury bonds, known as OFZs, are popular among investors around the globe thanks to their lucrative yields. Foreigners now own around 30 percent of Russia’s government bonds. The announcement of new possible sanctions sparked a sell-off in OFZs, sending their prices lower and lifting their yields. Yields in 10-year OFZ bonds jumped to 7.85 percent, their highest since June 20. “This is a very harsh bill,” said Vladimir Miklashevsky, an economist at Danske Bank in Helsinki. “The risk of sanctions on sovereign debt was the main reason why we were rather moderate when assessing the future of the Russian economy and its financial markets,” said Liza Ermolenko, an economist at Barclays in London. Russia’s Finance Ministry declined to comment on the new sanctions bill. If new U.S. sanctions target only new OFZ issues, their yields may rise by 2 percent and the rouble may weaken by 5 percent, Citi bank analysts said in a note. The new bill, announced days before U.S. senator Rand Paul is expected to visit Moscow, also envisages sanctions against Russian political figures and oligarchs as well as restrictions on energy investment. The rouble was also under pressure from market expectations that the Finance Ministry would further increase state purchases of foreign currency for its reserves. Russian stock indexes were down. The dollar-denominated RTS index was down 2.2 percent to 1,135 points, while the rouble-based MOEX Russian index shed 1.1 percent to 2,289 points.

The trade spat between the world’s top two economies intensified on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump raised pressure on China by proposing a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.

2018-08-02,"JOHANNESBURG, Aug 2 (Reuters) - South Africa’s Solidarity trade union said on Thursday it had accepted the latest three-year wage offer from struggling state-run power firm Eskom, but the other two bigger unions demanding pay hikes were yet to respond. Eskom is on a cost-cutting drive as it tries to emerge from a financial crisis and has been grappling with labour unrest for weeks after it initially refused to raise salaries. It caved in to union demands for higher pay after protesting workers forced some of its generating units to be switched off, leading to power outages in Africa’s most industrialised economy. Solidarity accepted a salary increase of 7.5 percent this year and 7 percent next year and the year after, plus an inflation-linked increase in housing allowances and a one-off cash payment of 5,000 rand ($370), the union, which represents mostly skilled workers, said in a statement. “For all our members across South Africa the right thing to do now would be to help prevent the economy from being hampered by an unreliable power supply,” Solidarity Chief Executive Dirk Hermann said. The National Union of Mineworkers and National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa, two larger unions at Eskom, are still discussing Eskom’s latest offer with their members. Eskom met union leaders on Thursday and said it hoped to find a solution to the wage impasse. Repairing Eskom’s depleted balance sheet is a major challenge for South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. Sources in the ruling African National Congress have said Eskom assets may be sold but this would likely face union opposition. $1 = 13.3714 rand

2018-08-02,"ARAÇATUBA, Brazil, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Brazil’s center-south is likely to produce an even smaller amount of sugar next year after a sharp drop reported in the current crop, as a harsh drought and reduced crop care will lead to a poor cane harvest, according to industry representatives. The world’s largest sugar producing region is expected by most analysts to cut output in the current crop, which runs from April 2018 to March 2019, to around 28 million tonnes from 36 million tonnes in the previous crop as cane volumes fall and mills prioritize ethanol production at the expense of sugar due to better returns for the biofuel. “It is hard to believe, but we see an even smaller cane crop next year,” said Dib Nunes Jr, a director at consulting firm Dr. Cana. Analysts project the ongoing center-south cane crop to fall to 560-570 million tonnes from 596 million tonnes last year, as most fields have not had widespread rains for more than two months. If next year’s crop shrinks, it would be the fourth consecutive reduction since the record 617 million tonnes of cane in 2015/16. With less cane and the focus on ethanol, sugar output would decrease again. “Most mills are short of money, they are cutting investment in plants and cane fields to pay bills,” Nunes said. He expects around 11 percent of fields to be renovated this year, lower than an ideal level of 17 to 18 percent, which will lead to older cane fields that tend to produce less. Marcos Tulio Bullio, a cane industry consultant at MTB Consultoria Empresarial, agrees that crop care is going to be weak this year. “They will be happy if they at least manage to apply herbicides, forget about other things,” he said. Weed killers are key for cane plantations, to avoid weeds that ‘steal’ nutrients from cane. The consultants talked to Reuters on the sidelines of the National Bioenergy Congress, a two-day event organized by industry group UDOP in Araçatuba, Sao Paulo state. Even with poor crop care, there is a possibility for a larger cane crop next season if it rains a lot in the Brazilian summer from December to March, sugar and ethanol broker and analyst Tarcilo Rodrigues said. Celso Jungueira Franco, owner of the Santa Adélia mill, disagrees. “We haven’t seen a drop in the Araçatuba region for almost 90 days. Mills aborted planting plans due to poor soil moisture. Even if it rains a lot, that will not compensate,” he said.

2018-08-02,"HOUSTON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Authorities on Thursday morning were investigating what caused a fire and a series of natural gas pipeline explosions on Wednesday in Midland County, Texas, which sent seven people to the hospital and shut down five lines before being extinguished late in the evening. Workers and firefighters were responding to a leak when the blast occurred, Midland County Fire Marshal Dale Little said on Thursday. Five workers with critical injuries were airlifted to University Medical Center in Lubbock, Texas, and were being treated at the center’s burn unit, medical center spokesman Eric Finley said on Wednesday. Also on Wednesday, two firefighters were also taken to hospital for treatment of burn injuries, said Elana Ladd, public information officer for the city of Midland. Ladd said the pipeline explosions occurred just outside the city of Midland on a rural road, FM 1379, about 5 miles south of Highway 158. The cause was under investigation, authorities said on Thursday. Kinder Morgan Inc’s El Paso Natural Gas (EPNG) line was damaged by the blaze. It looked as if the problem started with a nearby third-party pipeline, and Kinder Morgan is evaluating damage to its pipeline, company spokeswoman Sara Hughes said in an email. “There was a third-party pipeline involved that also experienced a failure, and preliminary indications are that the third-party line failure occurred before the EPNG line failure,” Hughes said. Oil and gas pipelines crisscross Midland County, which is located in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield. The explosions affected five pipelines which share a transit channel and which were all shut in by operators, a Midland city official said on Wednesday. Gas prices at the Waha NG-WAH-WTX-SN hub, in the Permian basin, increased by 13 cents, or about 6 percent, on Wednesday to $2.23 per million British thermal units, although much of the trade that day would have occurred before the fire, which started at around 11:14 a.m. CDT (1614 GMT). Thomson Reuters data showed that as of Thursday, the explosions had not yet affected overall flows of natural gas in Midland County, including on Kinder Morgan’s EPNG pipeline.

The Tulsa, Oklahoma, pipeline operator’s second-quarter net income was $214.4 million, up 2 percent from the same period a year ago. It posted earnings per share of $1.05 excluding special items. Analysts on average had expected earnings per share of $1.01 in the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue came in at $644.1 million, up from $619.4 million in the same period last year. Sales were boosted by “increased demand for our refined products and crude oil infrastructure,” Magellan Chief Executive Michael Mears said in a statement. The company’s crude oil operating margin rose by $46.2 million to a quarterly record of $152 million. Magellan said it plans to spend $900 million in 2018 and 2019 and $200 million in 2020 on projects including expanding its West Texas refined products pipeline system. It plans to spend $50 million building an eight-mile refined products pipeline between its facilities in Galena Park and east Houston in southeast Texas. Construction of a new dock will significantly increase crude oil export capabilities at its Seabrook Logistics joint venture with LBC Tank Terminals LLC in Houston, Magellan said. Magellan said it has received material for a refined products pipeline that will run from east Houston to Hearne, Texas, and expects to begin construction in September. It expects to receive steel for its crude oil pipeline in the Delaware Basin in West Texas in the fourth quarter. Both pipelines are expected to come online in mid-2019. The company is weighing some $500 million in other potential expansion projects and acquisitions. It also raised its annual guidance for 2018 distributable cash flow to $1.1 billion from its previous guidance of $1.05 billion.

2018-08-02,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global energy trader Gunvor Group is opening its first London office while also closing its trading desk in the Bahamas to increase efficiency in North America, sources familiar with the matter said. Gunvor had recently recruited a natural gas trading team for London, the sources told Reuters, adding that the Switzerland-based firm briefly had one trader in London a few years ago but this latest push was on a larger scale. Natural gas accounted for 23 percent of Gunvor’s traded volumes last year while crude oil accounted for 30 percent. Traded volumes rose 22 percent last year to 184 million tonnes. Some of the company’s Nassau staff, which included five traders, will be reallocated to other offices, including Houston, the sources said.   The firm grew its North American presence last year and now has two U.S. offices in Houston and Stamford, Connecticut as well as a representative office in Calgary, Canada.  “It was part of the re-alignment there and to make operations more efficient. It was redundant to have a trading office there on top of the new Houston one,” one source said.  Earlier this year, Gunvor said that in 2018 it would focus on the U.S. domestic market as well as liquefied natural gas.   The cost of the expansion was among the mains factors that weighed heavily on the firm’s net profit in 2017, which fell nearly 50 percent.

2018-08-02,"MILAN, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is due on Thursday to meet the mayor at the centre of a dispute threatening to delay work on the 4.5 billion euro Trans Adriatic Pipeline, the mayor said. Marco Poti, mayor of Melendugno, a seaside resort in Italy’s heel where the TAP pipeline will land, told Reuters the meeting was planned for 1800 local time (1600 GMT) in Rome. He said he would reiterate the total incompatibility of the project with the area which is heavily dependent on tourist revenues. Grassroot opposition to the project has revolved mainly around alleged environment risks and the fear the pipeline could hurt tourism. TAP, the last leg of the $40 billion Southern Gas Corridor that will bring Azeri gas to Italy, is due to start pumping gas in 2020 but the local opposition has raised concern that work at the Italian end may not be completed in time. The pipeline is viewed as strategic by the European Union as it moves to wean itself off its dependency on Russian gas. In July, Italian President Sergio Mattarella confirmed Italy was committed to TAP. At a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday, Conte said he was aware of the strategic nature of the pipeline, adding he would visit the local community and mayor to seek a solution. The U.S. administration is keen to see the pipeline completed on time. The prime minister’s office was not immediately available for a comment.

The high-interest loans are being refinanced through a mix of both rupee- and dollar-bond issuances, said the sources, who declined to be named as the discussions are private. Nayara did not respond to a Reuters’ email seeking comment. Rosneft and its partners - including global trader Trafigura and Russian fund UCP - in August 2017 closed the deal to buy Essar Oil, now known as Nayara Energy, for $12.9 billion. As part of the deal, Nayara inherited $5 billion in high-interest loans. Within months of the deal, Nayara refinanced the legacy high-cost loans with 20-year loans at more favourable terms, helping it to save $60 million annually, one of the sources said. The source also said Nayara was now looking to cut interest costs further by converting some of these refinanced loans to long-term bonds. The company on Wednesday raised 26 billion rupees ($380.16 million) via a three year domestic bond at an average coupon rate of 9.5 percent, said the three sources, who also said this would be followed by a $450 million dollar bond issue in a September. “Though the bond market is currently unattractive, with the backing of Rosneft, any fund raise will be at interest costs way better than earlier,” one of the sources said. Nayara has appointed JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank as advisers to the overseas bond issue. JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank did not respond to Reuters emails seeking comments. The refinancing will help Nayara to tackle legacy issues that it inherited from Essar Oil, which went into a corporate debt restructuring scheme after it defaulted on making loan payments. $1 = 68.3925 Indian rupees

2018-08-02,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China is considering measures to curb pollution in its smog prone Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and nearby areas during the upcoming winter season as the government ramps up its push to improve air quality, a draft plan showed on Thursday. That would be the second year Beijing has enforced emission cuts in winter. The cuts to heavy industry are aimed at reducing the concentration of breathable particles, known as PM2.5, by around 5 percent year on year from Oct. 1 until March 31, 2019 in the region. The steps are largely similar to those imposed last winter, which forced steel mills, coke producers, non-ferrous smelters and construction materials makers to shut part of their output capacity, although the government is giving the local authorities more leeway to choose appropriate measures for their region. Steel mills in six key cities, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Handan, Xingtai and Anyang, will be asked to cut 50 percent of their capacity during the heating season, which typically begins in mid-November. Firms in the rest of the cities in the region will need to shut no less than 30 percent. It also plans to switch 3.92 million households in the region to gas from coal heating by the end of October, and to urge local authorities to speed up infrastructure for gas storage and transportation while oil giants such as CNPC, Sinopec and CNOOC ensure gas supplies.

2018-08-02,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2O3VJZS By John Kemp LONDON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - The United States has adopted an “escalate to negotiate” strategy towards China, threatening a dramatic hike in tariffs to try to force a resumption of trade talks while the U.S. economy remains strong and as elections approach in November. U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly rejected a plan to levy tariffs of 10 percent on an additional $200 billion of imports from China and ordered aides to prepare a proposal for tariffs at the higher rate of 25 percent. The levies are in addition to the tariffs on $34 billion of imports that have already gone into effect and the $16 billion of tariffs announced but not yet implemented. The administration’s approach to China is the same one it has employed in dealing with North Korea, Iran, the European Union and NAFTA partners. The basic strategy, including the risks and opportunities, will be familiar to anyone who has studied the Cold War confrontation with the Soviet Union (“On escalation: metaphors and scenarios”, Kahn, 1965). The administration’s decision to escalate the confrontation dramatically at this point, threatening significant tariffs on a wide range of imports, including consumer items, is likely to stem from a combination of strength and fear. So far, the trade war appears to have hit China’s economy and financial markets harder than the United States, which has given the administration confidence that it is escalating from a position of strength. The U.S. S&P500 equity index is up by more than 5 percent since the start of 2018, and 25 percent since the start of 2017, while China’s Shanghai composite index has fallen by 13 percent and 7 percent respectively. The U.S. dollar has strengthened by 5 percent against China’s yuan since the beginning of the year and has risen by around 3 percent on a trade-weighted basis against the currencies of other major U.S. trading partners. China’s economy has shown signs of slowing, with the central government resorting to fiscal and monetary stimulus to offset the slowdown in external demand and boost confidence. In contrast, the U.S. economy expanded at an annualised rate of 4.1 percent in the second quarter, the fastest for almost four years, according to advance estimates (tmsnrt.rs/2O3VJZS). U.S. manufacturers have reported a broad-based upturn in business activity in recent months, while consumer confidence is close to multi-decade highs. The asymmetric economic and financial performance of the United States and China has convinced the White House it has “escalation dominance” and should press home its advantage. The White House strategy has been to escalate pre-emptively, secure in the belief China has more to lose than the United States on each of the next few rungs up the escalation ladder. Until now, China has matched U.S. tariff moves but not sought to escalate them, which has also probably also emboldened the White House to think it holds a stronger position on the escalation ladder. But if the White House thinks it is escalating from a position of strength, it probably also fears strength may not last forever and could diminish the longer the conflict lasts. Rapid U.S. GDP growth in the second quarter was mostly the result of tax cuts, which stimulated consumer spending, as well as a race to export soybeans and beat the tariffs. Growth in the third and fourth quarters is likely to be slower as these temporary effects unwind and the baseline for quarter-on-quarter comparisons becomes more challenging. Economic expansions tend to be cyclical, and even within each expansion there are spurts of rapid growth followed by more sluggish intervals, so the administration cannot count on the recent spurt to be sustained. Businesses are already starting to report widespread increases in input costs, in part as a result of steel and aluminium tariffs. Consumer price inflation is also rising and starting to erode the real value of wage rises. So far, the administration has tried to avoid imposing tariffs on consumer items in order to avoid politically controversial price rises at retail level. But if the United States is forced to carry out its threat and actually imposes 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of additional items from China, hitting consumer goods will become inevitable. Until now, senior administration officials have made great efforts to reassure investors and businesses that (a) tariffs are unlikely to be imposed; (b) even if imposed, the economic impact will be small; (c) the economy is strong enough to weather any hit; and (d) the short-term pain is worth the long-term gains from resetting relations with China. If the White House is forced to carry out its threat to extend 25 percent tariffs to a much wider range of items, however, the fallout will be greater and pose a more serious test of resolve for investors and businesses. Part of the strategy seems to be to intensify the pressure on China quickly through rapid escalation in the hope it will force an early restart of negotiations on advantageous terms and permit de-escalation quickly, before the economic damage becomes too great. If the White House can secure an early resumption of negotiations, or an early settlement, even a partial one, it will feature heavily in the political campaign ahead of congressional elections as a successful example of the president’s tough negotiating style. The administration therefore has a strong incentive to escalate quickly in the hope of forcing a favourable outcome well before the country goes to the polls in November. For the White House, the economic and political cycles favour rapid escalation in the hope of being able to claim an equally quick victory before the costs start to rise. By bringing the conflict to a crisis (in the Greek sense of “a moment of decision”) the administration hopes to end the dispute or at least de-escalate before the damage grows. China’s reaction remains uncertain, however, which introduces a dangerous element into the escalation strategy and means it could backfire. China’s economy is under greater pressure in the short term but its policymakers may conclude that it is better to absorb the short-term costs and wait for the pressure to start to mount on the United States. In the end, tariffs are a tax on consumers, and if high tariffs go into effect on consumer items, and are sustained for any length of time, the economic and political fallout could be considerable. There are already some preliminary signs that the global economic expansion has started to slow under pressure from higher oil prices and the costs and uncertainty created by the trade conflict. If the United States chooses to escalate rapidly while China elects to ride out the attack and wait for the costs to rebound on the U.S. and global economies, the damage to both as well as third countries could be extensive.

Germany’s blue-chip index DAX, which is seen as a trade war proxy, fell 1.5 percent in midday trading while the broader pan-European STOXX 600 was down about 0.8 percent. A number of poor trading updates, notably by German industrial conglomerate Siemens, also help drag down European bourses. U.S. stocks futures for the S&P, Dow Jones and Nasdaq were also trading in negative territory with losses between 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent. Euro zone government bond yields edged down. Borrowing costs in Germany and France pulled back from seven-week highs as demand for safe-haven debt grew after the U.S. administration increased pressure on China by proposing a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.6 percent down, dragged down by a 1.8 percent fall in Chinese H-shares. Analysts blame the current retreat in world stock markets on uncertainty around the trade policy of the Trump administration, while recent corporate results and economic data are seen overall as encouraging. “One needs to have a strong gut feeling to invest in this environment and in August, I doubt many people will have one,” said Herve Goulletquer, deputy head of research at France’s La Banque Postale Asset Management in Paris. He added that investors badly needed a “framework of interpretation” to read through the trade statements of the Trump administration and the poor visibility on that front was holding markets back. Sterling briefly and only modestly rose after the Bank of England hiked interest rates above their financial crisis lows and signalled it was in no hurry to tighten policy further with an uncertain Brexit on the horizon. The pound rose from $1.3081 to $1.3129 after the decision but quickly gave up its gains and was trading at 1.3050 by 1150 GMT. “Although today’s hike was priced in already for the most part, it should help to stabilise the pound, which in turn will keep a lid on imported inflation that can be exacerbated by a weakened currency,” said Hinesh Patel, a portfolio manager at Quilter Investors. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged as expected, characterizing the U.S. economy as strong and staying on track to increase borrowing costs in September and likely again in December. Oil prices fell for a third day, following a surprise increase in U.S. crude inventories that added to existing concern about the rapid rise in global crude supply.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China's PMIs drop: tmsnrt.rs/2LJn5ry By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Aug 2 (Reuters) - The Phoney War stage of U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade dispute with China may be ending, with economic indicators and commodity flows and prices starting to show real world effects. The latest signal that China’s economy may be feeling some pain associated with Trump’s tariffs on about $34 billion in Chinese goods was the softening of the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) in July. While the overall drop to 50.8 in July from June’s 51.0 was small, of bigger concern was the slump in the subindex for new export orders, which dropped to 48.4, a fourth consecutive monthly decline. The drop in the PMI, a key indicator of manufacturing health in the world’s second-largest economy, came as Trump’s administration proposed a 25 percent tariff on another $200 billion in Chinese goods, up from an earlier 10 percent plan. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement on Wednesday that Trump directed the increase from the previously proposed duty because China has refused to meet U.S. demands and imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. While a poor PMI for one month doesn’t necessarily signal a new trend, it does highlight the risk that the trade dispute is starting to hit economic growth. The so called Phoney War was an eight-month period of limited engagements and conflict at the start of World War II, lasting from Britain declaring war on Germany over its invasion of Poland to the Nazis invading France and the Low Countries. While a trade dispute is obviously not comparable to a shooting war, the current U.S.-China imbroglio may follow a similar pattern of months of mainly rhetoric and skirmishes before an eruption into a serious economic event. As early indicators of global economic health and trade flows, movements in commodity prices and volumes can be instructive. The temptation is always to look first at copper, given its correlation with both manufacturing and construction. London Metal Exchange copper futures have been trending lower since reaching their peak for this year so far in early June, closing at $6,172 a tonne on Wednesday. This is down almost 16 percent from the June peak, a period that coincides with the ramping up of tariffs by the United States, coupled with increasingly bellicose rhetoric. China’s appetite for imported copper has yet to falter, however, with first-half imports of unwrought copper up 16.3 percent from a year ago, according to Chinese customs data. In fact, the rate of growth in the first half well exceeded the 3.6 percent increase in imports of copper in the first half of 2017, showing that not only is China importing more of the industrial metal, it’s doing so at a faster pace. The strong copper imports may seem contradictory to the weak prices, although it’s likely that the market has been dropping mainly on sentiment, rather than on supply and demand. Other commodities also paint a mixed picture, with China’s iron ore imports dropping 1.6 percent in the first six months of 2018 from the same period last year. Iron ore prices have also been dropping, with benchmark 62 percent fines MT-IO-QIN62=ARG, as assessed by Argus Media, ending at $66.50 a tonne on Wednesday, down almost 17 percent from their peak this year of $79.90 in late February. The steel sector appears robust, though, with prices rising and solid gains in China’s steel PMI, to a seven-month high of 54.8 in July, well above the 50 level that demarcates expansion from contraction. Fundamental reasons can be found for both the weakness in iron ore, which is well supplied, and the strength in steel, which is still seeing strong demand and pollution-related output restrictions. Coal is another commodity that appears to have been unaffected by trade war concerns, with both Chinese import demand and prices rising strongly. China imported almost 10 percent more of the polluting fuel in the first half of 2018, while the benchmark thermal coal price at Australia’s Newcastle port rose to $121.75 a tonne on Wednesday, the highest in 6-1/2 years. China’s coal demand for power generation has been rising and domestic output gains haven’t been able to keep pace, meaning a draw on the seaborne market, which is already supply constrained, with major exporters Australia and Indonesia unable to boost output. There are commodities that have been affected by the trade dispute, but not to the extent of influencing global pricing, at least so far. China appears to have stripped back its imports of U.S. crude oil to near zero for September, having taken about 333,000 barrels per day in the first six months of the year, according to vessel-tracking data. It’s the same story for liquefied natural gas (LNG), with only one U.S. cargo booked for arrival in August, and it departed the Gulf of Mexico on July 1, before much of the current escalation in the trade dispute. The odd thing is that crude oil and LNG aren’t subject to any formal trade tariffs, and they appear most affected, while steel, which is the target of U.S. tariffs, is performing strongly. Logic suggests that if the trade dispute does continue to drag on China’s economic performance, eventually steel will join copper in trending lower. Thus, keeping an eye on China’s imports of major commodities in coming months will be key to working out just how quickly the trade dispute is filtering through to the real economy, and determining if the phoney trade war has become a real one.

2018-08-02,"DHAKA, Aug 2 (Reuters) - A vessel that arrived in Bangladesh in April to offload its maiden cargo of liquefied natural gas and moor permanently as an import terminal should begin operations “within a week” after bad weather hampered its start-up, an official said on Thursday. The floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) will allow Bangladesh to import LNG for the first time as its domestic gas production falls and will boost several power projects in a nation where 30 percent go without electricity. Since its arrival at Moheshkhali, near Cox’s Bazar in southeast Bangladesh, bad weather has hampered the FSRU’s efforts to dock properly, connect to the import infrastructure and offload its first cargo of Qatari LNG, officials have said. “The delay was basically the rough sea. It (the project) will succeed very soon ... hopefully within a week,” a director at state-run energy firm Petrobangla’s LNG division said. The Excellence FSRU is operated by privately owned U.S. company Excelerate, which launched the first FSRU in the world in 2005 and still dominates the industry alongside Golar LNG , Hoegh and BW Group’s LNG arm. Two senior Petrobangla officials said the state-run firm would contest Excelerate’s declaration of force majeure on the project due to the weather-related delays. Declaring force majeure absolves a company from responsibility for delays to fulfilling contracts due to circumstances beyond its control. “They have claimed force majeure for bad weather but we haven’t accepted it,” one of the officials said. “Petrobangla doesn’t have any obligation to pay any money before the gas flow starts. Excelerate will pay demurrage as per contract.” That official said technical experts from International Finance Corp, an arm of the World Bank which lent to the $180 million project, were on site monitoring progress. The country of 165 million people relies on its gas resources for 70 percent of its energy production but as demand has risen its falling supply has struggled to keep up, prompting it to consider a host of LNG projects. Aside from the Moheshkhali project, several others are being considered, usually combining LNG imports with onshore power plants that would use the regasified fuel as feedstock or with fertiliser complexes that are heavily gas-reliant. Most recently, two projects costing a combined $5.8 billion were announced involving U.S. firm General Electric. Energy trading houses Gunvor, Vitol and Trafigura have also chased projects in Bangladesh.. Bangladesh is seen as an ideal LNG importer because it has the legacy of using gas and therefore much of the onshore infrastructure already, unlike some other countries that have struggled to get LNG projects off the ground. Nasrul Hamid, state minister for power, energy and mineral resources, said the Moheshkhali project would help Bangladesh import 81 million cubic metres of gas a day by 2025. “We have a robust internal gas supply system, which has historically transmitted our local gas. This grid will carry the LNG internally. This is an advantage for us,” he said.

2018-08-02,"RICHMOND, Texas (Reuters) - Few U.S. energy policies can bring together coal miners, oil drillers, environmentalists, Republicans and Democrats.  But tax credits for capturing and storing carbon dioxide emissions have appeased all these camps, and Congress this year tripled the subsidy’s value with broad bipartisan support. If only they could convince utilities - the biggest industrial polluters - to get on board. A Reuters survey of the top 10 U.S. power companies showed eight have no plans to purchase and install carbon capture and storage (CCS) equipment, citing high costs and uncertain demand, while the other two declined to comment. Another three utilities that are well-placed to adopt the technology - because of their proximity to existing carbon pipelines and coal reserves - also said they have no plans to tap the newly enriched subsidy. The technology employs sophisticated equipment to pull carbon dioxide from industrial plants and then inject it underground so it never pollutes the atmosphere.  That could help fight climate change while giving coal and natural gas plants a new commodity they can sell to oil drillers. When carbon dioxide is injected into ageing oil fields, it helps drillers increase pressure and push more oil to the surface. The potential of CCS is on display in Texas, where the utility NRG (NRG.N) and joint venture partner JX Nippon, a Japanese energy firm, built a $1 billion operation called Petra Nova at the state’s largest coal-fired power plant. In the 19 months since NRG installed the shiny steel pipes and towers, the project has kept nearly 1.7 million tons of heat-trapping gas from the atmosphere and multiplied oil output at the nearby West Ranch oil field by 15-fold. Petra Nova had key financial advantages that are difficult for other utilities to duplicate. The Japanese government provided a $250 million (£191 million) loan to the project in hopes of finding better ways to use coal as an alternative to nuclear energy after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011.  The effort also won a $190 million grant in 2010 from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Clean Coal Power Initiative, which supports innovations that produce “clean, reliable, and affordable” electricity from coal. David Knox, an NRG spokesman, said operating Petra Nova is showing the firm ways to cut costs for the next generation of the technology, such as using smaller towers with less steel. “We feel you can build a second one for maybe up to 20 percent cheaper,” Knox said, although his company is focussed on perfecting Petra Nova rather than building a new CCS operation.  Other utilities that do not have access to the same government and private funding worry that big-ticket investments on CCS would not pay off - even with tax credits now worth $35 per tonne of carbon dioxide captured and reused, compared to $10 previously. Any new industrial facility that injects carbon dioxide into an oil field before 2024 is eligible for the expanded tax credit, but the programme’s success relies heavily on power plants, which produce nearly 30 percent of U.S. carbon emissions. “Although increased credits for CCS are positive, the amount still does not address the significant capital and operating costs,” said Melissa McHenry, a spokeswoman for American Electric Power (AEP.N), in a comment typical of responses from other utilities. Duke Energy, Southern, Dominion, Exelon, Xcel, PG&E, and Edison International also said they had no such plans, while NextEra Energy Inc and PSEG did not comment. Three small utilities that industry watchers say are among the best-suited to adopt CCS technology - Rocky Mountain Power, Black Hills and OG&E - also told Reuters they had no plans to do so. “Carbon capture is definitely interesting, it just hasn’t made economic sense just yet,” said Spencer Hall, a spokesman for Rocky Mountain Power. Utilities say that it is unclear when or if revenues from CCS would cover the required investment. Another concern is that President Donald Trump’s successor could reverse efforts to support the coal industry, accelerating plant closures and making long-term CCS investments pointless. The hesitancy of utilities represents a setback for the coal industry which had hoped carbon capture would help extend the lives of coal-fired power plants. It also means that oil companies that want access to greater supplies of carbon dioxide may need to look beyond coal and gas plants.  Texas drillers have been revitalising ageing fields for 40 years using carbon dioxide from naturally occurring deposits and from natural gas processing. But those supplies are not enough to sustain the industry’s ambitions. Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), the top user of the technique in the Permian Basin, wants to expand its use of carbon injection from traditional oil fields to shale wells, said Jody Elliott, the president of Occidental’s American operations. The company believes the technique could boost oil output in the largest U.S. oil field by 180,000 barrels per day from 3.2 million now. The Permian “has a large inventory of future CO2 projects which could be developed over the next 20 years,” Elliott said. But that would require carbon captured from power stations, and plants that make ethanol, fertiliser and cement, along with billions of dollars in new pipelines to take carbon to the fields.  Julio Friedmann, who worked in the Energy Department under President Barack Obama and earlier as a scientist for Exxon Mobil, said he sees interest from ethanol plants and other industrial facilities to add carbon capture to plants, but urged utilities to join them. “I don’t know what they imagine they are looking for,” he said. “But if they are just waiting for better policy treatment, they may be disappointed.” Reporting by Timothy Gardner; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Brian Thevenot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-carbon-storage/analysis-u-s-utilities-balk-at-expanded-carbon-capture-subsidy-idUKL1N1TM18H,02 Aug 2018,"Few U.S. energy policies

2018-08-02,"TEPIC, Mexico, Aug 2 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Mexico’s president-elect, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, will have a better chance of slashing poverty and inequality if he weaves a strong green thread through his policies, analysts say. But despite high hopes the environment will be a top priority for his government, some fear plans to boost energy security by revitalising Mexico’s petroleum industry sit uncomfortably with pledges on climate change and biodiversity. “If they achieve everything they say, in six years Mexico will be in a very strong position regarding environmental protection,” Gustavo Ampugnani, Mexico director for conservation group Greenpeace, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “It’s the chance to see environment and climate themes intersecting with other policies, not divided off as happened in the previous governments.” Lopez Obrador - a former mayor of Mexico City, known by his initials, AMLO - swept to victory on July 1, vowing to tackle corruption, violence and inequality in a bid to “transform” the Latin American country where over 40 percent live in poverty. Outlining its environmental strategy before the poll, his party said it would prioritise communities as it seeks to improve water quality and access, while strengthening climate change action and promoting sustainable cities and biodiversity. However, experts say steps to slash planet-warming carbon emissions, reduce deadly air pollution and push greener public transport are at odds with the new president’s intention to reinvigorate the petroleum industry. Seeking to curb massive fossil fuel imports from the United States, Lopez Obrador wants to prioritise domestic crude oil production - which has fallen since 2004 - while building one or two refineries during his term, which begins on Dec. 1. Andres Flores Montalvo, climate change director for the World Resources Institute Mexico, a think tank, said Mexico had high potential for cleaner energy sources. “That can help a lot in achieving the main goal which is energy self-supply - with many other benefits,” he said. Mexico has a target of producing 35 percent of electricity from clean sources by 2024, compared to just over a fifth today. Fighting poverty and climate change are closely linked, Flores added. “The more developed you are as a society, the more you are resilient to climate impacts,” he said. Incoming environment minister, Josefa Gonzalez-Blanco Ortiz-Mena drew up the green strategy for AMLO’s party, the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA). The ardent environmentalist runs an eco-park in the south of Mexico that integrates animals back into the wild. Her office said she was not available for interview. Mexico’s Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources has seen its budget cut by a third since the current president, Enrique Pena Nieto, came to power. MORENA wants to rewrite a law it says prioritises water concessions for industry over households. In Mexico, where water access is deemed a human right, more than 30 percent of homes lack a regular water supply, and 70 percent of surface water is contaminated. Environmentalists said more money was needed to enforce laws to stop industrial pollution and protect watersheds. Restoring damaged ecosystems like forests, which are largely owned by rural and indigenous communities, could also improve water access and quality, while creating local jobs, they added. The new government’s plan for a national climate change policy that promotes renewable energy sources, including solar, wind and mini hydro-power plants, could turn on the lights and bring opportunities for poor communities, experts said. Large investors are increasingly looking to “de-carbonise” holdings and are less interested in petroleum, said Alba Aguilar Priego, head of new markets at the Mexican Stock Exchange. They are eyeing long-term assets involving renewable energy, clean transport, and water and waste management, said Aguilar, whose exchange expects to start carbon trading next year. She urged the new government to make environmental disclosure mandatory for businesses, to help investors choose well and ensure pension funds put a minimum into green assets. Rolling out Mexico’s national biodiversity strategy will be essential to strengthen its ecosystems by 2024, said the National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (CONABIO), which published the plan in 2016. “We are running out of time,” said Andrea Cruz Angon, CONABIO’s biodiversity strategies coordinator. Aware of the new government’s funding constraints, CONABIO is working with other organisations on ways to cover the costs of implementing the strategy, which focuses on conservation, landscape restoration and sustainable resource management. Meanwhile, with nearly 80 percent of Mexicans living in cities, MORENA wants to make urban areas more sustainable and generate finance to upgrade public transport. Also on its to-do list are reducing marine and coastal damage exacerbated by poorly planned development, while stopping illegal felling in Mexico’s forests. The party says 70 percent of wood on the market comes from unauthorised sources. Lopez Obrador has said he will not undertake projects without first considering their environmental and community impacts - and green groups will be watching closely. “We believe this new administration has a great opportunity to reconcile society with nature,” said Greenpeace’s Ampugnani.

2018-08-02,"Aug 2 (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday will move to revoke California’s authority to set its own strict tailpipe emissions rules and mandate the sale of electric vehicles, as it proposes weakening Obama-era federal fuel efficiency standards. The proposal to roll back anti-pollution efforts, to be released early on Thursday according to one administration official, is in line with President Donald Trump’s decision last year to abandon the 2015 Paris deal aimed at slowing climate change. It will escalate the administration’s legal battle with California and about a dozen other states that have adopted California’s emission rules, and account for about a third of the U.S. auto market. Seventeen states, including California, and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit in May challenging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s decision a month earlier to declare U.S. vehicle emission rules in place through 2025 “not appropriate.” In March, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said he would use “every legal tool” to protect the current standards. Trump promised Midwestern auto workers last year that he would tear up vehicle rules touted by the administration of former President Barack Obama as among its biggest climate actions. Democrats hope to make any rollback a key part of the 2018 congressional elections. Republicans in states with links to the auto industry may contend the administration is working to ensure automakers can make more profitable larger vehicles, including fuel-thirsty pickups and SUVs, without excess regulation and state interference. Some middle ground on the issue might be possible, with acting EPA chief Andrew Wheeler saying Wednesday he would welcome a deal between the industry and states like California on vehicle fuel economy, once they consider the Trump administration’s proposal. The rollback in emissions standards is problematic for automakers. The administration has said it will deliver regulatory relief potentially worth billions, by reducing the need for costly technologies required to achieve greater fuel efficiency. But it does so in a way that could create more uncertainty for an industry already struggling with rising tariff risks and a murky sales outlook. Automakers have long pressed for one set of rules for emissions and greenhouse gases, saying a national regulatory framework to improve fuel economy reduces complexity and costs for the industry. The “preferred option” in the administration’s proposal, to be issued by the EPA and the U.S. Department of Transportation, would freeze the Obama fuel efficiency targets at 2020 levels, requiring no further improvement. That means the fleets of cars and light trucks sold by automakers in the United States could average about 37 miles (59.5 km) per gallon, instead of the 46.8 mpg projected for 2026 under the Obama rules. U.S. fuel consumption would increase by about 500,000 barrels daily as a result, a person briefed on the matter said, adding that such an increase would have only a “negligible impact” on the global climate. The administration has characterized its proposal to freeze fuel efficiency and emissions targets as a step that would save up to 1,000 lives per year, by reducing the cost of new vehicles and encouraging people to buy safer new cars sooner. Environmental groups have criticized that analysis and said the proposal would drive up gasoline prices and reverse one of the most significant steps Washington has taken to curb climate changing greenhouse gas emissions. It would also put more lives at risk due to asthma-inducing emissions, environmental advocates say. Trump’s decision to challenge California’s authority to regulate vehicle emissions upends decades of federal policy undertaken to allow the largest U.S. state to combat air pollution that particularly afflicts Los Angeles. Eliminating California’s electric vehicle mandate could hurt automakers like Tesla Inc and General Motors Co, which are already investing billions in EVs. Relying on the state’s regulatory authority, California Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat, set a target in January of putting 5 million zero-emission vehicles on the roads in California by 2030, up from a prior goal of 1.5 million by 2025.

In a phone call, he said he departed the company a few days ago. He did not give a reason for his exit. Trafigura declined to comment. His exit follows the appointments of Ben Luckock and Robert Gillon as co-heads of oil for Trafigura last month. In April, the company named Hadi Hallouche as head of oil for Asia while keeping his role as global head of natural gas. Li Yuting, another senior China-based oil marketer at Trafigura, left the firm last year, said a Beijing-based trading executive briefed on the matter. Global oil suppliers are facing a more competitive business environment in China this year as demand has slowed from independent refineries due to tighter government tax rules and as oil prices have risen to four-year highs. In the first half of the year, Trafigura’s profits sank 53 percent due in part to the market shift from a contango, where forward prices of a commodity are higher than prompt prices, to backwardation, which discourages storing oil for sale later.

2018-08-02,"* Investors, brokers flag worries about forward month liquidity * September expiry seen as big test for Shanghai crude contracts (Reledes, changes sourcing, cites INE response in paragraphs 2, 5 and 6) By Meng Meng and Josephine Mason BEIJING, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE) is considering appointing market makers to boost trading volumes in its nascent crude oil futures amid growing concerns about liquidity as the first contract heads for expiry later this month. Responding to a report by Reuters earlier on Thursday, the INE, part of the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE), said in an email that it was studying introducing a market-maker scheme following requests from some investors. The exchange has approached at least two major brokers in recent weeks about finding investors to help drum up business in the less-active forward months, two sources familiar with the matter said. Those investors would be similar to market makers, who are often deployed by international exchanges such as CME Group Inc and Intercontinental Exchange to fuel activity in new contracts. “In recent days, some market investors have asked the exchange to follow practices from other international exchanges and introduce the market making scheme to further provide liquidity for forward month contracts,” the INE said. “We are seriously considering the request and demands from investors and are currently studying and seeking advice from investors for a plan,” the exchange said. The potential candidates for the role would be institutional investors, such as wealth managers and hedge funds, the sources said. The sources declined to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media. The move comes amid worries among investors and brokers that liquidity in the market is concentrated in the September contract, which expires at the end of this month. September’s expiry is seen as a big test of China’s first yuan-denominated oil contract, which was launched four months ago aimed at gaining greater clout in global crude pricing. “More investors will roll their September contracts into December in the coming weeks. Right now, liquidity in December is not high enough to attract big investors,” said Wang Xiao, head of crude oil research with Guotai Junan Futures. State-controlled oil majors have helped provide liquidity, but getting a commitment from other investors to do so would enhance efforts to increase interest in the market. Monthly exchange data shows that turnover in the contract has surged since its launch. In July, it accounted for 7 percent of global turnover in oil futures, taking third place behind London’s Brent and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI), with Arab oil heavyweight Dubai in fourth. But most of the daily turnover and open interest, a measure of liquidity, is concentrated in the September contract, which expires at the end of this month. The December contract has a cluster of activity, but the drop-off is steep. Chinese commodity futures investors do not typically trade steadily over the months, but instead pick specific months in which they deal. That complicates efforts to trade spreads between Brent, WTI and Shanghai. “The monthly gap between Shanghai contracts and global oil futures created difficulties for arbitrage,” said Wang. Having more liquidity spread out across forward months is considered important for luring international hedge funds and other financial players, who like to trade month by month. Open interest across the first five months of the Brent and WTI contracts and is relatively evenly spread out. INE slashed fees for the October and November contracts last month and on Tuesday cut them for the January and February months, which was seen as an effort to make liquidity spread out more evenly across forward months and to engage in industrial traders such as refiners who tend to trade month by month, the INE said. Combined open interest in those four contracts was just 445 lots on Thursday, equivalent to just under 500,000 barrels of oil and tiny in comparison to September which has almost 14,000 lots of open interest.

2018-08-02,"* Germany’s DAX falls 1.1 pct * STOXX 600 dips 0.5 percent * Euro zone bond yields edged down * Oil prices steady By Julien Ponthus LONDON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Fears of an escalating trade dispute between the United States and China spread from Asian markets to Europe on Thursday, triggering a fall in bonds yields and stocks, particularly among exporters. Germany’s blue-chip index DAX, which is seen by as trade war proxy, fell 1.1 percent about an hour after the open while the broader pan-European STOXX 600 was down about 0.5 percent. Euro zone government bond yields edged down with borrowing costs in Germany and France pulling back from seven-week highs as demand for safe-haven debt grew after the U.S. administration increased pressure on China by proposing a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.6 percent down, dragged down by a 1.8 percent fall in Chinese H-shares. Analysts blame the current retreat in world stock markets on the uncertainty around the trade policy of the Trump administration, while recent corporate results are seen encouraging. “One needs to have a strong gut feeling to invest in this environment and in August, I doubt many people will have one” said Herve Goulletquer, deputy head of research at France’s La Banque Postale Asset Management in Paris. He added that investors badly needed a “framework of interpretation” to read through the trade statements of the Trump administration and the poor visibility on that front was holding markets back. The British pound was slightly down at $1.3086 ahead of an expected rate hike by the Bank of England later in the day. While a rate hike is widely expected and mostly priced in, analysts warned clients not to be complacent as the market reaction would probably be tough to read. “While a failure to act would in all likelihood trigger a sharp selloff in the pound, given the rate rise is already priced in,” said Michael Hewson of CMC Markets, “we could well see some sterling weakness in any case if the bank is overly dovish in its guidance.” The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, as expected, characterizing the U.S. economy as strong and staying on track to increase borrowing costs in September and likely again in December. Oil prices steadied after losses over the past two days from a surprise increase in U.S. crude inventories and renewed concerns over trade friction between the U.S. and China. Brent crude futures LCOc1 were up flat at $72.39 a barrel by 0854 GMT, after dropping 2.5 percent on Wednesday.

Spot thermal coal cargo prices from Australia’s Newcastle terminal GCLNWCPFBMc1 last settled at $121.75 per tonne, their highest since February 2012 and up by a third from their 2018 low, set in April.

Temperatures in key coal-consuming regions of North Asia and Europe hit records in July and the heat that has continued into August is set to persist, meteorological services said. GRAPHIC: Heatwave    reut.rs/2Klf1aG Weather analyst Ed Whalen said “widespread warmth between 1-4 degrees Celsius above normal was observed across much of South Central, East, and Northeast China over the past seven days”. Hot weather would this week “dominate most of China once again,” he added. In Japan, the unusual heatwave last week pushed temperatures in Tokyo above 41 degrees Celsius. Beyond maximising coal-burning, Japanese utilities have cranked up old oil-fired power stations to cope with the spike in power demand, which has also sent the country’s wholesale electricity prices to record highs. Extreme heat has also gripped large parts of Europe, with temperatures in Spain and Portugal exceeding 40 degrees Celsius and even Scandinavia seeing temperatures of more than 30 degrees. The hot weather has also pushed up river temperatures across the region, forcing several nuclear power stations that use the waters for reactor cooling to reduce output.

GRAPHIC: Coal prices outperform oil and gas in 2018    reut.rs/2O3ym2m With the coal price boom virtually uninterrupted since April, some in the industry are asking how long the rally can continue.

2018-08-02,"* Says one-way fares to rise by S$5-S$30 * Scoot also looking to cut costs * Singapore Airlines, SilkAir fares to remain tied to supply/demand (Adds Singapore Airlines comment on fares) SINGAPORE, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines Ltd’s budget arm Scoot said on Thursday it would raise fares across its network by an average of about 5 percent in response to a surge in oil prices that had pushed up costs. The fare hike, effective Sept. 1, will add $5 to S$30 ($3.66 to $21.98) to the cost of each one-way journey depending on the flight duration, the airline said in a statement. Carriers around the world are attempting to raise fares to help recoup the rising cost of fuel, with the oil price up 40 percent to $73 a barrel over the last year. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) in June forecast average passenger yields, a proxy for air fares, would rise by 3.2 percent this year, in the first annual gain since 2011 but lowered its annual profit estimate due to the rising cost of fuel and labour. Air New Zealand Ltd in May announced a 5 percent increase in domestic fares due to rising costs, while regulators in Japan and Taiwan have allowed airlines to put in place fuel surcharges to help compensate for the higher oil price. Singapore Airlines last week reported a 3.2 percent decline in passenger yields for the quarter ended June 30, including a 1.8 percent fall at Scoot, disappointing investors who had hoped for fare increases. Scoot on Thursday said it would look to cut costs in addition to raising fares, with initiatives being considered including exploring ways to reduce fuel burn, reviewing supplier contracts and using measures to increase productivity. The airline said fuel comprised an average of 32 percent of its operating costs and its fuel costs had risen by 31 percent compared to a year earlier. Scoot reported a S$1 million profit in the June quarter, down from S$3 million a year earlier. Singapore Airlines said there were no plans for the parent airline and its regional arm SilkAir to follow Scoot’s lead and announce specific fare rises in response to higher oil prices. “Our airfare pricing is dynamic based on supply and demand,” a Singapore Airlines representative said.

2018-08-02,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - The Phoney War stage of U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade dispute with China may be ending, with economic indicators and commodity flows and prices starting to show real world effects. The latest signal that China’s economy may be feeling some pain associated with Trump’s tariffs on about $34 billion in Chinese goods was the softening of the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) in July. While the overall drop to 50.8 in July from June’s 51.0 was small, of bigger concern was the slump in the subindex for new export orders, which dropped to 48.4, a fourth consecutive monthly decline. The drop in the PMI, a key indicator of manufacturing health in the world’s second-largest economy, came as Trump’s administration proposed a 25 percent tariff on another $200 billion in Chinese goods, up from an earlier 10 percent plan. (GRAPHIC: China's PMIs drop: tmsnrt.rs/2LJn5ry) U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement on Wednesday that Trump directed the increase from the previously proposed duty because China has refused to meet U.S. demands and imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. While a poor PMI for one month doesn’t necessarily signal a new trend, it does highlight the risk that the trade dispute is starting to hit economic growth. The so called Phoney War was an eight-month period of limited engagements and conflict at the start of World War II, lasting from Britain declaring war on Germany over its invasion of Poland to the Nazis invading France and the Low Countries. While a trade dispute is obviously not comparable to a shooting war, the current U.S.-China imbroglio may follow a similar pattern of months of mainly rhetoric and skirmishes before an eruption into a serious economic event. As early indicators of global economic health and trade flows, movements in commodity prices and volumes can be instructive. The temptation is always to look first at copper, given its correlation with both manufacturing and construction. London Metal Exchange copper futures have been trending lower since reaching their peak for this year so far in early June, closing at $6,172 a tonne on Wednesday. This is down almost 16 percent from the June peak, a period that coincides with the ramping up of tariffs by the United States, coupled with increasingly bellicose rhetoric. China’s appetite for imported copper has yet to falter, however, with first-half imports of unwrought copper up 16.3 percent from a year ago, according to Chinese customs data. In fact, the rate of growth in the first half well exceeded the 3.6 percent increase in imports of copper in the first half of 2017, showing that not only is China importing more of the industrial metal, it’s doing so at a faster pace. The strong copper imports may seem contradictory to the weak prices, although it’s likely that the market has been dropping mainly on sentiment, rather than on supply and demand. Other commodities also paint a mixed picture, with China’s iron ore imports dropping 1.6 percent in the first six months of 2018 from the same period last year. Iron ore prices have also been dropping, with benchmark 62 percent fines, as assessed by Argus Media, ending at $66.50 a tonne on Wednesday, down almost 17 percent from their peak this year of $79.90 in late February. The steel sector appears robust, though, with prices rising and solid gains in China’s steel PMI, to a seven-month high of 54.8 in July, well above the 50 level that demarcates expansion from contraction. Fundamental reasons can be found for both the weakness in iron ore, which is well supplied, and the strength in steel, which is still seeing strong demand and pollution-related output restrictions. Coal is another commodity that appears to have been unaffected by trade war concerns, with both Chinese import demand and prices rising strongly. China imported almost 10 percent more of the polluting fuel in the first half of 2018, while the benchmark thermal coal price at Australia’s Newcastle port rose to $121.75 a tonne on Wednesday, the highest in 6-1/2 years. China’s coal demand for power generation has been rising and domestic output gains haven’t been able to keep pace, meaning a draw on the seaborne market, which is already supply constrained, with major exporters Australia and Indonesia unable to boost output. There are commodities that have been affected by the trade dispute, but not to the extent of influencing global pricing, at least so far. China appears to have stripped back its imports of U.S. crude oil to near zero for September, having taken about 333,000 barrels per day in the first six months of the year, according to vessel-tracking data. It’s the same story for liquefied natural gas (LNG), with only one U.S. cargo booked for arrival in August, and it departed the Gulf of Mexico on July 1, before much of the current escalation in the trade dispute. The odd thing is that crude oil and LNG aren’t subject to any formal trade tariffs, and they appear most affected, while steel, which is the target of U.S. tariffs, is performing strongly. Logic suggests that if the trade dispute does continue to drag on China’s economic performance, eventually steel will join copper in trending lower. Thus, keeping an eye on China’s imports of major commodities in coming months will be key to working out just how quickly the trade dispute is filtering through to the real economy, and determining if the phoney trade war has become a real one.

2018-08-02,"* Ex-Japan Asia down 1.5 pct, China shares hit again * Trade worries keep companies, investors cautious * Global bond yields up on higher U.S. borrowing, BOJ * European shares seen down 0.4 pct By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Asian stocks tumbled on Thursday as the latest escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade war hit Chinese shares, while global bond markets were rattled by increased borrowing by Washington and Japan’s new tolerance for higher yields. European shares are expected to fall, with financial spread-betters see Britain’s FTSE, France’s CAC, Germany’s DAX opening 0.4 percent lower. Japan’s Nikkei declined 1.1 percent while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 1.5 percent, dragged down by a 2.2 percent fall in Chinese H-shares. The CSI 300 index of China’s A-shares dropped 3.0 percent to 2,741, near its 1 1/2-year low of 2,691 set on July 6. Shares of export-dependent electronics firms fell 4.1 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 2.5 percent to 10-month lows while an index of Chinese start-up firms sank 3.5 percent to its lowest level since January 2015. “Market sentiment was dampened by renewed trade war fears,” said Zhang Quan, an analyst at Huaan Securities. “But investors need not be overly pessimistic as China is taking steps to hedge the risks from trade frictions with the United States, including monetary and fiscal policy easing.” The U.S. administration on Wednesday increased pressure on China for trade concessions by proposing a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. “If it had not been for the sideswipe on trade, markets would have been in much better shape this week. Apple’s earnings were super, helping to quell concerns about high-tech companies,” said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities. “The BOJ’s policy tweaks weren’t much of a tightening, and did little damage,” he added. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe is down 0.45 percent so far this week, reversing gains from the previous four weeks, with Chinese shares accounting for the bulk of that. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 lost 0.10 percent on Wednesday, but the Nasdaq Composite added 0.46 percent to extend its recovery from Monday’s three-week low. While industrial stocks fell 1.3 percent on trade worries, technology shares were boosted by strong earnings from Apple. The world’s largest company by market capitalisation rose 5.9 percent, boosting its value to close to $1 trillion. The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, as expected, characterising the U.S. economy as strong and staying on track to increase borrowing costs in September and likely again in December. While that surprised nobody, U.S. bond yields rose, with the benchmark 10-year yields breaking above 3 percent to 2-1/2-month highs, after the U.S. Treasury said it would boost borrowing in the bond market in the coming quarter. Global bond markets were also rattled by sharp rises in Japanese bond yields since the Bank of Japan loosened its grip on long-term yields on Tuesday. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield rose to a 1-1/2-year high of 0.145 percent. It last stood at 0.120 percent. The BOJ conducted an unplanned buying in 10-year JGBs in the afternoon, curbing rise in the yields. Worries that higher yields in Japan may prompt Japanese investors to repatriate funds hit European bonds, boosting German and French yields to seven-week highs on Wednesday. In the foreign exchange market, major currencies were little moved. The euro changed hands at $1.1650, while the yen stood at 111.56 yen to the dollar. The British pound was steady at $1.3101 ahead of an expected rate hike by the Bank of England later in the day. The Chinese yuan held relatively stable at 6.8308, almost flat on the day. Oil prices climbed a tad after two days of heavy losses on a surprise increase in U.S. crude stockpiles. Brent crude futures rose 0.3 percent to $72.63 per barrel after a 2.5 percent fall the previous day. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged up 0.2 percent to $67.78 a barrel after Wednesday’s 1.6 percent fall. Additional reporting by Andrew Glabraith in Shanghai,

2018-08-02,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian energy group OMV’s (OMVV.VI) adjusted net profit fell short of expectations in the second quarter despite higher oil prices and output, as the company said on Thursday it took a hit on hedging and its tax rate jumped. Clean current cost of supplies (CCS) net income attributable to stockholders, which excludes special items and inventory gains or losses, fell 4 percent from a year earlier to 272 million euros (£242 million), below an average forecast of 311 million euros in a Reuters poll of analysts. A larger poll posted on OMV’s website had an even higher average forecast of 350 million euros.  “Positive net market effects were driven by higher oil prices and partly offset by negative hedging effects as well as the negative FX impact following the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro,” OMV said. The group’s clean tax rate also jumped to 49 percent from 35 percent a year earlier, which OMV said was partly because more of its production came from highly taxed countries in the Middle East and Africa region. The hedging effects also increased its tax rate, it said. Its clean CCS operating result, however, rose 10 percent to 726 million euros, between the Reuters and OMV polls’ average forecasts of 680 and 765 million euros.

This may be many years away, but it is the future envisioned by the European Union, which wants to make the electricity system more efficient as the continent switches from predictable fossil-fuel power generation to intermittent renewables.  Most utilities have long offered cheaper night-time tariffs, but new EU rules expected in 2020 will require them to provide more flexible options that encourage customers to use power during sunny or windy periods, at varied times of day or when businesses are shut at weekends. These kind of flexible “dynamic pricing” contracts are already widely offered in Spain and Scandinavia. But utilities in some of the biggest European markets like Britain and France are now beginning to follow suit in a shift that analysts say could disrupt the continent’s electricity retailing industry. The nascent drive is enabled by the mass rollout of smart meters, which can precisely record energy usage patterns. “From now on, consumers in Europe will be able to seize more spot market opportunities as the rise of renewable power and the availability of smart meters and internet-connected appliances boost dynamic pricing,” said Jean-Marc Ollagnier, group CEO of consultancy Accenture Resources. Newer, smaller players are offering the most experimental tariffs, selling power in hourly or even half-hourly slots tied to wholesale spot prices. The big, traditional utilities like EDF (EDF.PA) and Centrica (CNA.L) are responding more gradually by offering variable time-pricing options. Klaus-Dieter Borchardt, director Internal Energy Market at the European Commission, the EU’s executive, says variable pricing could cut power bills for a household by up to 400 euros ($470) a year.  It is early days in Europe, and in other developed power markets such as the United States and Australia. Utilities largely sell at fixed prices, regardless of wholesale swings or time of usage, and dynamic pricing accounts for a fraction of the market - but it is growing.  The number of customers on dynamic pricing rates globally is expected to rise from 4.5 million in 2018 to 75 million by 2025, of which 15 million will be in Europe, according to Navigant Research analyst Brett Feldman.  Experts say automation will be crucial for take-up. The proportion of households with smart appliances is expected to rise to about 10.6 percent globally by 2022 from 3.5 percent now, according to market data provider Statista. “Convenience is key,” Ollagnier said. “Users want to be able to ‘set and forget’ smart rules for their appliances.” The Commission agrees. “To enable consumers to benefit financially from those new opportunities, they must have access to fit-for-purpose smart systems as well as electricity supply contracts with dynamic prices,” it said in a policy document. An anticipated surge in electric vehicle usage will also bolster uptake of flexible pricing tariffs, analysts say.  British startup Octopus Energy in March launched an “Agile” tariff which sells power in 30-minute slots tied to wholesale spot prices. It also sends SMS alerts when prices turn negative and customers get paid for taking excess power off the grid, which happens a few times a year on sunny and windy days.      The two-year-old company, whose UK market share is about 1 percent, has limited the experimental tariff to 500 of its more than 200,000 residential customers. “We hit that limit quickly and are now assessing the impact before expanding further, which we expect to do next year,” CEO Greg Jackson said. Octopus told Reuters it was working with electronics companies including Samsung (005930.KS) to allow its software to communicate with smart household appliances so that they can switch on automatically at the cheapest time.  The company said a family on its Agile tariff could have saved 210 pounds ($275) over the last 12 months compared with average British fixed-rate prices.  Green Energy UK, another small player, is offering contracts with varying “time-of-day” rates for residential customers, ranging on weekdays from 5 pence per kilowatt hour to 20 pence.  In France, Engie (ENGIE.PA), which has 4 million customers, has also started offering flexible pricing deals including 30 percent weekend discounts and, for electric vehicle owners, a 50 percent discount for nighttime charging.  Engie’s retail chief Augustin Honorat declined to detail how many customers have flexible tariffs. “It is a success, as the offers are among our best-sellers,” he said.  The flexible contracts offered by new players are prompting traditional utilities to offer their own options, analysts say.  French market leader EDF, for example, has launched offers with 30 to 40 percent tariff discounts for weekend use and a tariff that offers varying rates for each eight-hour period of the day. EDF marketing director Gregory Trannoy said the new offers were “growing quickly” but declined to give numbers.  Oliver Wyman consultant Keric Morris said dynamic pricing was a big operational challenge for traditional utilities. “It is much more difficult for an incumbent with all its legacy systems, than for a nimble start-up,” he said. The European Commission’s Nov. 2016 Clean Energy Package aims to force all utilities to offer customers smart meters and a dynamic price contract linked to spot market prices. The rules are being negotiated with the EU Parliament and member states this year, with a target for implementation from 2020. That may be overly ambitious; several EU states do not yet have the smart meters required for flexible pricing, notably major power market Germany. The case of Spain gives an idea of the potential of dynamic pricing - as well as the possible obstacles.  Spain decreed in 2014 that utilities had to offer dynamic pricing contracts as the default regulated offer. All Spanish utilities now offer contracts linked to hourly spot prices on the OMIE exchange and with utilities’ margins set by regulation.  The European Commission estimates that in Spain - where 28 million smart meters were installed end 2017 - about 40 percent of power users have some form dynamic pricing.  However, Pedro Gonzalez, head of regulation at Spanish utilities association Unesa, told Reuters that this is down from about 60 percent four year ago.  Despite the fact that power is slightly cheaper on dynamic contracts, their number has fallen as customers switch to fixed-price contracts because they want the peace of mind of not being exposed to fluctuating wholesale prices. “Surprisingly, despite the fact that average dynamic prices should be lower, many people want to avoid risk and prefer to pay a fixed amount per month,” Gonzalez said. He said the number of people on dynamic pricing contracts has been stable over the past year, and that in recent months utilities have started offering intermediate options such as varying rates for different blocks of the day.   In the Nordics, many utilities offer dynamic pricing, though uptake ranges from about 30 percent in the tiny but highly digital Baltic country Estonia to 10 percent in Finland and a few percent in Sweden and Norway, according to EU data.  Industry specialists say much will depend on to what extent the European Commission’s proposal on dynamic pricing is accepted, but all agree the higher the share of renewables in total generation, the bigger the pressure will become to make demand more flexible.  Octopus Energy’s Jackson said mass rollout of smart meters could ultimately lead to a sophisticated form of congestion pricing, with supply and demand increasingly driving prices. “On trains and airlines, the first seats are very cheap, the last ones very expensive,” he said. “The electricity market will end up like that too.”  Additional reporting by Susanna Twidale in London, Lefteris Karagiannopoulos in Oslo and Jose Elias Rodriguez in Madrid; Writing by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Pravin Char",https://uk.reuters.com/article/europe-electricity-prices/insight-run-your-dishwasher-when-the-sun-shines-dynamic-power-pricing-grows-idUKL8N1UD5AH,02 Aug 2018,"One day, the weather could drive

2018-08-02,"* Scoot cites higher oil prices * One-way fares to rise by S$5-S$30 * Scoot also looking to cut costs SINGAPORE, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines Ltd’s budget arm Scoot said on Thursday it would raise fares across its network by an average of about 5 percent in response to a surge in oil prices that had pushed up costs. The fare hike, effective Sept. 1, will add $5 to S$30 ($3.66 to $21.98) to the cost of each one-way journey depending on the flight duration, the airline said in a statement. Carriers around the world are attempting to raise fares to help recoup the rising cost of fuel, with the oil price up 40 percent to $73 a barrel over the last year. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) in June forecast average passenger yields, a proxy for air fares, would rise by 3.2 percent this year, in the first annual gain since 2011 but lowered its annual profit estimate due to the rising cost of fuel and labour. Air New Zealand Ltd in May announced a 5 percent increase in domestic fares due to rising costs, while regulators in Japan and Taiwan have allowed airlines to put in place fuel surcharges to help compensate for the higher oil price. Singapore Airlines last week reported a 3.2 percent decline in passenger yields for the quarter ended June 30, including a 1.8 percent fall at Scoot, disappointing investors who had hoped for fare increases. Scoot on Thursday said it would look to cut costs in addition to raising fares, with initiatives being considered including exploring ways to reduce fuel burn, reviewing supplier contracts and using measures to increase productivity. The airline said fuel comprised an average of 32 percent of its operating costs and its fuel costs had risen by 31 percent compared to a year earlier. Scoot reported a S$1 million profit in the June quarter, down from S$3 million a year earlier. Singapore Airlines did not respond immediately to a request for comment on whether the parent airline and regional arm SilkAir were also planning a fare hike.

2018-08-02,"* June trade surplus widens to A$1.87 bln vs forecast of A$900 mln * Exports to China up strongly; iron ore, coal, LNG all rise * Net exports likely a small plus for GDP growth in Q2, not a drag By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Australia’s trade surplus blew past expectations in June as exports to China boomed to their second highest on record, a sign the commodity-leveraged country was weathering the early stages of Sino-U.S. tariff hostilities. A report on Thursday from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed Australia’s trade surplus swelled by 158 percent to A$1.87 billion ($1.38 billion), double the market forecast and the largest since May last year. Exports climbed 2.6 percent on a pick-up in a broad range of goods from iron ore and gold to farm and manufactured items, the data showed. Imports fell 0.7 percent as a pullback in petrol outweighed strength in transport and telecoms equipment. The windfall owed much to China, which has been hoovering up Australia’s iron ore and coal output even as trade tensions with the United States have escalated. Analysts noted that much of Australia’s exports to China are primary products used in the Asian nation’s domestic economy rather than for re-export. There has also been no sign of a slowdown in the rapid growth of Chinese tourism or the flow of students from the country. Indeed, exports of goods to China hit the second strongest on record in June at A$10.34 billion, an increase of almost 40 percent from the same month last year. “U.S. President Donald Trump would have few concerns with the U.S.-Australia trade imbalance - it is in the U.S. favour by A$18 billion over 2017/18,” noted Craig James, chief economist at fund manager CommSec. “By contrast Australia’s trade surplus with China stands at almost A$38 billion.” Liquefied natural gas sales to China and Japan have been a major growth area, with export earnings up 14 percent in June alone at just over A$4 billion. Shipments are set to ramp up further as the giant Ichthys field off northern Australia has finally started producing after a long wave of delays. The $40 billion project run by Inpex Corp is Japan’s biggest overseas investment. One risk to exports is a drought currently ravaging large parts of the farm belt in Australia, which is likely to cut agricultural shipments later in the year. For the whole of the June quarter, Australia’s trade surplus came in at a seasonally adjusted A$2.9 billion, down modestly from the first quarter when a rebound in resource shipments flattered the accounts. Much of that pullback looked to be due to changes in prices rather than volumes and thus not a drag on gross domestic growth (GDP), said Westpac senior economist Andrew Hanlan. “Net exports are likely to be slightly positive in Q2, adding in the order of 0.1 percentage points to activity,” he estimated. Analysts had thought trade - exports minus imports - would subtract from GDP in the second quarter given it had added a sizable 0.4 percentage points the quarter before. $1 = 1.3515 Australian dollars

2018-08-02,"* Ex-Japan Asia down 0.8 pct, China shares hit again * Trade worries keep companies, investors cautious * Global bond yields up on higher U.S. borrowing, BOJ By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Asian stocks dropped on Thursday as the latest escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade war hit Chinese shares, while global bond markets were rattled by increased borrowing by Washington and Japan’s new tolerance for higher yields. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.8 percent, dragged down by a 1.2 percent fall in Chinese H-shares. Japan’s Nikkei declined 0.4 percent. The CSI 300 index of China’s A-shares dropped 1.4 percent to three-week lows, extending falls from a July 24 high to 5.5 percent. The U.S. administration on Wednesday increased pressure on China for trade concessions by proposing a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. “If it had not been for the sideswipe on trade, markets would have been in much better shape this week. Apple’s earnings were super, helping to quell concerns about high-tech companies,” said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities. “The BOJ’s policy tweaks weren’t much of a tightening, and did little damage,” he added. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe is down 0.45 percent so far this week, reversing gains from the previous four weeks, with Chinese shares accounting for the bulk of that. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 lost 0.10 percent on Wednesday, but the Nasdaq Composite added 0.46 percent to extend its recovery from Monday’s three-week low. While industrial stocks fell 1.3 percent on trade worries, technology shares were boosted by strong earnings from Apple. The world’s largest company by market capitalisation rose 5.9 percent, boosting its value to close to $1 trillion. The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, as expected, characterising the U.S. economy as strong and staying on track to increase borrowing costs in September and likely again in December. While that surprised nobody, U.S. bond yields rose, with the benchmark 10-year yields breaking above 3 percent to 2-1/2-month highs, after the U.S. Treasury said it would boost borrowing in the bond market in the coming quarter. Global bond markets were also rattled by sharp rises in Japanese bond yields since the Bank of Japan loosened its grip on long-term yields on Tuesday. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield rose to a 1-1/2-year high of 0.145 percent on Thursday. Worries that higher yields in Japan may prompt Japanese investors to repatriate funds hit European bonds, boosting German and French yields to seven-week highs on Wednesday. In the foreign exchange market, major currencies were little moved. The euro changed hands at $1.1661, while the yen stood at 111.67 yen to the dollar. The British pound was steady at $1.3119 ahead of an expected rate hike by the Bank of England later in the day. Oil prices climbed a tad after two days of heavy losses on a surprise increase in U.S. crude stockpiles. Brent crude futures rose 0.5 percent to $72.78 per barrel after a 2.5 percent fall the previous day.

2018-08-02,"TOKYO, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday, recouping a portion of the losses of the last two days that were driven by reports showing surprise gains in U.S. inventories of crude, along with mounting concern over trade friction between the U.S. and China. Brent crude futures were up 25 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $72.64 a barrel by 0055 GMT, after dropping 2.5 percent on Wednesday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures increased by 26 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $67.92 a barrel. They fell $1.6 percent in the previous session. U.S. crude inventories rose 3.8 million barrels last week as imports jumped, the government’s Energy Information Administration said. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a decline of 2.8 million barrels. There were some bullish elements in the report, notably gasoline stocks declining by 2.5 million barrels. Also, crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for WTI futures were down, dropping by 1.3 million barrels, EIA data showed. On Tuesday, the EIA reported that U.S. crude production fell 30,000 barrels per day to 10.44 million bpd in May. Nonetheless, the tough talk from Washington on trade with China has put pressure on oil prices. U.S. President Donald Trump sought to ratchet up pressure on China for trade concessions by proposing a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, his administration said on Wednesday. China said it would hit back if the United States takes further steps on trade. Brent prices fell more than 6 percent and U.S. crude slumped about 7 percent, the biggest monthly declines for both benchmarks since July 2016. Brazilian oil exports hit a record in July, nearly three times its shipments in June and 50 percent higher than a year earlier, government data showed on Wednesday. Iraq exported 3.543 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude from its southern ports in July, slightly above the June average, the oil ministry said on Wednesday. Russian oil production last month was on average above the level Moscow promised following the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC meeting in June, energy minister Alexander Novak indicated on Wednesday. Novak said that higher production was needed to maintain the market’s stability.

2018-08-02,"(Repeats Aug. 1 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2M8FqdG By John Kemp LONDON, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Middle distillates, including road diesel and marine gasoil, are the critical link between global growth and the oil market. Distillates will be at the heart of three developments in the next two years that determine the direction of oil prices as well as the longevity of the current economic expansion: * If sustained, global economic expansion and the associated growth in trade volumes will boost consumption of mid-distillates significantly, and lead to a further drawdown in available stocks. * Pollution regulations scheduled to go into effect from January 2020 will further boost distillate consumption as a cleaner substitute for residual fuel oil in ocean shipping. * Tightening distillate supplies will push up crude oil prices, resulting in a widespread increase in inflation, upward pressure on business costs, and tending to curb the cyclical expansion. It seems unlikely the global economy will still be growing strongly while oil prices remain at comfortable levels for consumers at the same time as the shipping regulations go into effect at the start of 2020. Cyclical tightening of distillate markets plus new fuel regulations are inconsistent with moderate crude oil prices. Something will have to give. Either global economic growth will slow of its own accord, easing the pressure on distillate supplies, or crude oil prices will rise enough to force an economic slowdown. Mid-distillates accounted for 35 million barrels per day of global oil consumption in 2017, around one-third of the total, according to BP (“Statistical Review of World Energy”, 2018). Freight transportation, including cargo moved by road, rail, pipelines, barges, shipping and aviation, is the biggest end-user of fuels derived from the middle part of the crude barrel. Substantial quantities are also used by manufacturing firms, as well as miners and within the oil and gas industry itself, with much smaller volumes used for heating and cooking. Distillate consumption is more closely geared to the level of business activity and the macroeconomic cycle than any other section of the oil market. Distillate stocks are in turn closely correlated with changes in benchmark crude prices and the shape of the futures curve. Since mid-distillates are one of the most important refinery outputs, the link is not surprising. As the distillate market alternates between over- and under-supply, Brent cycles between contango and backwardation (tmsnrt.rs/2M8FqdG). Periods when distillate stocks were abnormally high (1998/99, 2001/02, 2006, 2009/10 and 2015/16), all linked to slower growth in economic activity, have been associated with a large contango in Brent. Likewise, periods when distillate stocks became unusually tight (1999/2000, 2003/04, 2007/08 and 2012-2014), mostly linked with stronger economic growth, have all been associated with Brent backwardations. Stock draws in distillates have been much more closely associated with the shift in Brent spreads than changes in gasoline stocks. The same pattern has been evident during the most recent oil market slump and recovery, with distillate stocks surging in 2015 and 2016, before drawing equally strongly in 2017 and so far in 2018. Strong growth in distillate consumption in 2017 and early 2018 coincided with a period of strong and synchronised growth in the major global economies and a marked acceleration in freight movements. Distillate consumption is outstripping production in the United States, and in much of the rest of the world, resulting in a broad reduction in inventories. U.S. distillate stocks, which were 36 million barrels above the five-year average in early 2017, have now fallen to 18 million barrels below in July 2018. U.S. distillate consumption rose 5 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2018 but production was up by only 1 percent (“U.S. distillate inventories are low for this time of year”, EIA, July 27). The same phenomenon is evident globally. OECD distillate stocks have fallen from 618 million barrels in May 2016 and 605 million in May 2017 to just 521 million in May 2018 (“Oil Market Report”, IEA, July 2018). The drawdown in distillate stocks has corresponded closely with the shift in Brent calendar spreads from contango to backwardation and the rise in Brent spot prices. Distillate markets are tightly coupled with the global economy - and the relationship likely runs in both directions. Changes in the level of manufacturing activity and freight movements have a direct impact on the consumption and availability of transport fuels. But changes in fuel prices also have a significant impact on input costs for a wide range of businesses as well as inflation. The outlook for distillate prices (and by extension oil prices) therefore depends critically on what happens to the global economy over the next 18 months. If the global economic expansion continues at its current rapid pace, distillate availability will become stretched, and oil prices will rise strongly. The scheduled implementation of new International Maritime Organization fuel regulations at the start of 2020 will only exacerbate this tightness and could intensify upward pressure on oil prices even before they go into effect. Eventually, the rise in fuel costs will act as a drag on global economic growth, and bring the cyclical expansion to an end. Conversely, if the global expansion slackens on its own, perhaps as a result of trade tensions, distillate supplies will be more comfortable. Plentiful distillates would curb or even reverse the upward trend in oil prices, and extend the current cyclical upswing for an additional period.
