2018-03-30,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council blacklisted dozens of ships and shipping companies on Friday over oil and coal smuggling by North Korea, boosting pressure on Pyongyang as leader Kim Jong Un plans to meet with his South Korean and U.S. counterparts. The council’s North Korea sanctions committee acted on a request by the United States, designating 21 shipping companies — including five based in China — 15 North Korean ships, 12 non-North Korean ships and a Taiwanese man. The move comes days after Kim met Chinese President Xi Jinping and an announcement that the North Korean leader would meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in on April 27. He is also  scheduled to meet U.S. President Donald Trump some time in May. While Trump has agreed to meet Kim, he tweeted on Wednesday that “maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained.” Tension over North Korea’s tests of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles surged last year and raised fears of U.S. military action in response to the North’s threat to develop a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. But the situation has eased significantly since North Korea sent athletes to the Winter Olympics in South Korea in February. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said the U.N. sanctions designations — the largest agreed by the council’s committee — were aimed at shutting down North Korea’s illegal smuggling activities to obtain oil and sell coal. “The approval of this historic sanctions package is a clear sign that the international community is united in our efforts to keep up maximum pressure on the North Korean regime,” she said in a statement.  The list was part of a request by Washington late last month for 33 ships, 27 shipping companies and the Taiwanese man to be sanctioned. China delayed that bid on March 2, but did not give a reason. The 15-member committee works by consensus.  Washington then proposed a shortened list on Thursday, which was unanimously agreed by the committee on Friday. The 12 non-North Korea ships are now subjected to a global port ban and must be deregistered, while the 15 North Korean ships are subjected to an asset freeze and 13 of those a global port ban. The Taiwanese man, Tsang Yung Yuan, is accused of coordinating “North Korean coal exports with a North Korean broker operating in a third country, and he has a history of other sanctions evasion activities,” according to the U.N. listing. He is subjected to an asset freeze and travel ban.  The assets of the 21 shipping companies, which include businesses based in the Marshall Islands, Singapore, Panama and Samoa, must now be frozen.  The U.N. Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, banning exports including coal, iron, lead, textiles and seafood, and capping imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products.

2018-03-30,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - A recent drought in oil company mergers and acquisitions could be coming to an end over a new Texas range war: U.S. shale producers are building miles-long horizontal wells that are running into their rivals’ land holdings.  This week, U.S. shale producer Concho Resources Inc (CXO.N) said longer horizontal wells are among the factors spurring its $8 billion deal for rival RSP Permian Inc RSPP.N, with well spacing and sharing infrastructure needs also playing roles. RSP Permian controlled the land adjacent to its own in many cases.  The average length of U.S. shale wells has grown by roughly 1,500 feet, or 25 percent, in the past three years to 7,213 feet, according to RS Energy Group, an energy investment data provider. Producers are drilling longer shale wells - some exceed three miles - to extract more crude from each well.  Oil company M&A fell in the wake of the 2014 oil price crash and more producers refocused on their best holdings. The value of U.S. oil producer deals last year was less than half the $137.7 billion in 2013, according to data provider PLS Inc. That could be changing in West Texas’s Permian, the largest U.S. oilfield, where checkerboard-like leases dating to land grants made to railroads in the 19th century are hemming in producers.  “Consolidating acreage is going to be extremely meaningful,” said Brook Papau, managing director of RS Energy. “We’ll see more deals.” Smaller companies with prime acreage, especially on the Permian’s western edge, could be buyout candidates, including Abraxas Petroleum (AXAS.O), Lilis Energy LLEX.A and Jagged Peak Energy (JAG.N), industry analysts have told Reuters. Shared transport systems, such as oil and gas gathering and water disposal, also are driving the need for scale and property acquisitions in addition to horizontal wells, called laterals, Concho Chief Executive Tim Leach said this week.  “Long laterals and (avoiding) the parent-child relationship” where close well spacing reduces output, drove the deal, said Leach. “Large, contiguous blocks of acreage are strategic,” he told investors.  After dropping 8.7 percent on the steep purchase price, Concho shares on Thursday retraced much of the fall, rising 5 percent to $150.33.  “The investment community has consistently espoused the merits of consolidation within a highly fragmented business,” said Simmons & Co analyst David Kistler in a note to clients praising the Concho-RSP deal. Still, M&A is not the only way to get more adjacent land. Chevron Corp (CVX.N) last year swapped or sold more than 60,000 acres in the Permian Basin.  The deals, Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said in a February earnings call, “create value by consolidating land positions, allowing longer laterals and other infrastructure efficiencies.”  Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Andrea Ricci",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-oil-permian/as-shale-wells-grow-longer-buyouts-attract-hemmed-in-oil-producers-idUKL1N1RB24S,30 Mar 2018,"A recent drought in oil

2018-03-30,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea President Moon Jae-in said on Friday cooperation with China is needed not only to end tension over North Korea’s weapons but also to tackle the problem of air pollution. Moon raised South Korea’s concern about pollution arriving from China in talks with Chinese special enjoy Yang Jiechi, in Seoul to brief South Korea on this week’s meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “President Moon Jae-in stressed the seriousness of South Korea’s fine dust problem,” said South Korea’s presidential spokesman, Kim Eui-kyeom. “Korea’s fine dust is caused by factors at home but as a Chinese factor also lies behind the problem, voices are growing  among South Koreans asking for close cooperation between South Korea and China,” the spokesman cited Moon as saying. Worsening air pollution has been a chronic problem in South Korea especially during the spring. Authorities have suspended operations at five old, coal-fired plants from March to June to cut pollution. Yang suggested the two sides work to cut pollution by setting up a joint environmental center, the spokesman said.

2018-03-30,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling party is struggling to change a “perception” that it is against minority Muslims and lower-caste people, a political ally said, which could cost it votes in a general election due next year. Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)  trounced the opposition at the last election in 2014, but it has lost a handful of recent by-elections after opposition groups banded together. Veteran politician Ram Vilas Paswan, a federal minister and the chief of the Lok Jan Shakti (People’s Power) Party, which is allied with the BJP and says it represents India’s socially backward classes, predicted another term for Modi. But he said the BJP would have to work towards changing its image as a group that caters mainly to upper-caste Hindus. “Whatever the government is doing it is doing for everyone; even for the minority community it has done a lot,” Paswan said in an interview in his bungalow, seated on a couch under a huge oil painting of himself. “But despite everything, the perception is not changing among the minorities and the scheduled castes (socially backward classes) irrespective of the work being done.” India’s 1.3 billion people are about 80 percent Hindu and 14 percent Muslim, according to the latest census data. Backward classes make up about three-quarters of the Hindu population. Critics say the BJP’s Hindu nationalist agenda has polarised the population.  Since Modi came to power in 2014, hardline Hindu groups and cow protection vigilantes have carried out numerous attacks on Muslims accused of eating beef or killing cows.  Many Hindus believe cows are sacred and killing them is banned in most states.     ‘WELL-MEANING’ A crackdown on abattoirs, tanneries and leather factories, mostly run by Muslims, has also hit a large number of lower-caste Hindus who transport cattle and work in tanneries.  Paswan said the opposition could take advantage of the BJP’s pro-upper class Hindu image and it needed to be countered aggressively. The BJP said Paswan’s comment was a “well-meaning observation from an ally” but that the party has “foiled repeated attempts of the opposition Congress party to create an impression that the BJP is losing the perception battle”. “We need to be cognizant of the fact that opposition parties have been raising a bogey of non-issues, but so far they’ve failed,” said BJP spokesman G.V.L. Narasimha Rao. When Modi won office in 2014, his party or its partners ruled only seven of India’s 29 states. Today, it is in power in 21 of them and has replaced Congress as the party with strongest nationwide presence. But in by-elections for 10 parliamentary seats since last year, the BJP has lost all of them and two small regional parties have walked out of the ruling coalition. Paswan, whose party enjoys considerable support from the Muslim community in his home state of Bihar in the east, said ending ties with the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was “unthinkable”. “This is essentially a government of the BJP, they have an absolute majority. Still Modi has given space to allies like us,” said Paswan, a 10-time member of parliament who began his political career in 1969.  “Can’t even think of leaving the NDA. No one has approached me and I am happy where I am.” Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan, Robert Birsel",https://uk.reuters.com/article/india-politics/modi-ally-says-indias-ruling-party-suffers-from-perception-it-is-anti-muslim-idUKL3N1RB54F,30 Mar 2018,"* Prime Minister Modi to face general elections due by May

2018-03-30,"ULAANBAATAR/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Mongolia, supplier of about 40 percent of the world’s raw cashmere, hopes to boost profit trading in the wool used in some of the world’s priciest luxury fashions by opening up a new online platform for global buying via China’s Bohai exchange. In a statement on Friday, the Mongolian Commodity Exchange (MCE) said the platform should begin trading in mid-April. Until now, traders or their representatives have had to be physically present to buy cashmere from the MCE, Mongolia’s only permitted cashmere trader.  The exchange said trading in agricultural products and also coal and copper could follow at a later date. But cashmere currently accounts for around 90 percent of the exchange’s total trade: In 2017, 7,000 tonnes of washed cashmere were sold on the MCE with a total value of 521 billion tugrik ($217.99 million). “Cooperation with the Bohai Commodity Exchange is opening up a market for Mongolian commodities not only in China but to other countries as well,” Chuluunbaatar Bayar, general manager of the MCE, told Reuters. “Italian buyers would be able to buy Mongolian cashmere via the Bohai exchange, for example,” Chuluunbaatar said. “The online platform allows factories to purchase Mongolian cashmere through the Bohai commodity exchange directly, without sending their representatives to Mongolia.”  The cashmere launch follows the signing of a strategic cooperation agreement with the Bohai Commodity Exchange (BOCE) in January. BOCE already trades a variety of textile products including cotton, cashmere, goose feathers and eiderdown. BOCE did not immediately respond to requests for comment when contacted by Reuters on Friday.      Mongolia has struggled to maximize profit from its cashmere industry, with most of the processing done more cheaply across the border in China. The Mongolian government launched a four-year program to boost the industry in February, with the aim of boosting exports more than fivefold, providing financial support to help domestic firms improve technology and boosting the country’s processing capacity.  The Development Bank of Mongolia and the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Light Industry have also established an 500 billion tugrik “Cashmere Development Fund”.  Mongolia has an estimated total of 27 million goats, and an annual cashmere production capacity of 9,400 tonnes.

2018-03-30,"HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China is taking its first steps towards paying for imported crude oil in yuan instead of the U.S. dollar, three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, a key development in Beijing’s efforts to establish its currency internationally.  Shifting just part of global oil trade into the yuan is potentially huge. Oil is the world’s most traded commodity, with an annual trade value of around $14 trillion, roughly equivalent to China’s gross domestic product last year.  A pilot programme for yuan payment could be launched as early as the second half of this year, two of the people said.  Regulators have informally asked a handful of financial institutions to prepare for pricing China’s crude imports in the yuan, said the three sources at some of the financial firms.  “Being the biggest buyer of oil, it’s only natural for China to push for the usage of yuan for payment settlement. This will also improve the yuan liquidity in the global market,” said one of the people briefed on the matter by Chinese authorities.  China is the world’s second-largest oil consumer and in 2017 overtook the United States as the biggest importer of crude oil. Its demand is a key determinant of global oil prices.  Under the plan being discussed, Beijing could possibly start with purchases from Russia and Angola, one of the people said, although the source had no details of anything in the works.  Both Russia and Angola, like China, are keen to break the dollar’s global dominance. They are also two of the top suppliers of crude oil to China, along with Saudi Arabia. [O/CHINA1]  The move would mark a major step in reviving usage of the currency of the world’s second-largest economy for offshore payments after several years of on-again, off-again measures. If successful, it could also trigger shifting other product payments to the yuan, including metals and mining raw materials.  All three sources, who spoke to Reuters on the condition that they not be named, said the plans were at early stages. Officials at some of China’s state oil companies said they had not heard of such plans.  (GRAPHIC - Global crude futures volumes by contract: reut.rs/2GkLih8) The plans coincide with this week’s launch of the first Chinese crude oil futures in Shanghai <0#ISC:>, which many expect to become a third global price benchmark alongside Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude.  Shanghai’s new crude contract is traded in yuan.  Besides the potential of giving China more power over global oil prices, “this will help the Chinese government in its efforts to internationalise renminbi (yuan),” said Sushant Gupta, research director at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.  Unipec, trading arm of Asia’s largest refiner Sinopec (600028.SS), has already inked a first deal to import Middle East crude priced against the newly-launched Shanghai crude futures contract.      U.S. bank Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients this week that the success of Shanghai’s crude futures was “indirectly promoting the use of the Chinese currency.”  People’s Bank of China (PBOC), the country’s central bank, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the plan. The Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) also declined to comment.  China’s plan to use yuan to pay for oil comes amid a more than year-long gradual strengthening of the currency, which looks set to post a fifth straight quarterly gain, its longest winning streak since 2013.  The yuan retained its No.5 ranking as a domestic and global payment currency in January this year, unmoved from a year ago, but its share among other currencies fell to 1.7 percent from 2.5 percent, according to industry tracker SWIFT.  A slew of measures put in place in the last 1-1/2 years to rein in capital flowing out of the country amid a slide in yuan value has taken off some its shine as a global payment currency. But the yuan has now appreciated 3.4 percent against the dollar so far this year, with solid gains in recent sessions.      “For PBOC and other regulators, internationalization of the yuan is clearly one of the priorities now, and if this plan goes off smoothly then they can start thinking about replicating this model for other commodities purchases,” said the person briefed on the matter.  It would not be easy, however, for China to shift the bulk of its commodity purchases to the yuan because of the currency’s illiquidity in forex markets.  Nearly 90 percent of all transactions in the $5 trillion-a-day currency markets involve the dollar on one side of a trade, while only 4 percent use the yuan, as per a triennial forex survey by the Bank for International Settlements.

The front-month contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was at 418.9 yuan  ($66.85) at the end of the morning session at 11:30 a.m. (0330 GMT), taking its cue from Thursday gains of about 1 percent for both benchmark Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI). “China’s tax rebate plan will help support oil demand. Reports that China will pay for oil in yuan will also benefit the crude futures market,” Wang Xiao, head of research with Guotai Junan Futures, said in a note on Friday. Shanghai crude rebounded from a low of 401.6 yuan notched on Thursday as investors started covering short positions after the rebound in the foreign oil benchmarks. “Domestic crude market played catch-up with foreign markets,” said Yan Guangwen, crude analyst with Luzheng Futures, adding that a bearish crude outlook from independent refiners could again put prices under pressure in the near term. Friday was the first day Shanghai contracts traded with other major financial markets in the United States and Europe shut for a holiday. Sunday is Easter, and many exchanges are closed for Good Friday.

2018-03-30,"(Repeats March 29 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - China’s new crude oil futures contract, which began trading this week, has a good chance of confounding the doubters and becoming a regional benchmark where other contracts have failed. The history of futures and options trading is littered with new contracts launched amid great fanfare but which subsequently failed to develop sufficient liquidity and have been discontinued or faded into irrelevance. But the new crude futures contract launched on the Shanghai International Energy Exchange comes after years of meticulous preparation and has many of the ingredients needed to be successful. Three elements determine the success or failure of a new futures contract, according to an extensive literature review prepared for the Shanghai Futures Exchange three years ago. The contract must fulfil a commercial need for hedging. It must succeed in attracting a pool of speculators. And public policy must not be too adverse (“Why some futures contracts succeed and others fail”, Till, 2014). China’s new oil futures contract clearly meets the first two criteria and has a fair chance of succeeding on the third as well. China has already overtaken the United States to become the world’s largest crude importer, so there is a clear need to hedge the resulting price risks. The need for a new contract and its basic features were showcased two years ago in a presentation by China’s leading crude importer (“Review of current and potential Asian oil benchmarks”, Unipec, 2016). China’s refiners import mostly medium and heavy sour crudes, which trade at a substantial discount to lighter and sweeter oils. The two main existing benchmarks, Brent and U.S. light sweet crude, also known as WTI, are based on light low-sulphur crude oils. In contrast, the new Shanghai futures contract is based on a basket of medium and heavy crudes from the Middle East and China itself with a significantly higher sulphur content. The new futures contract approximates the sort of crudes that China is importing much more closely than Brent or WTI. Foreign crudes deliverable against the contract include oils from the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Iraq, which all trade freely. But they also closely resemble other grades China imports in significant volumes, including crude from Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia. The new contract is denominated in yuan rather than U.S. dollars, allowing refiners to manage their price risks more effectively. The contract should have no difficulty in attracting a pool of speculators to provide liquidity since China has a large number of domestic traders and brokers familiar with commodity markets. China has already launched several highly successful contracts, including steel, iron ore and copper, all of which have become liquid benchmarks. There is a large community of domestic speculators and a network of brokerages, which should help the new contract succeed. China has many of the network characteristics that have made Chicago, New York, London and Singapore successful futures trading hubs. The biggest source of uncertainty surrounds the attitude of the government towards price volatility and its willingness to allow fairly unrestricted futures trading. China’s government has not always been comfortable with extreme price swings and high levels of speculative activity, and has periodically intervened in the markets. But the same impulses have been seen in other futures trading centres, at least historically, and China’s regulatory interventions have not prevented the successful development of contracts for other commodities. Given China’s increasing dependence on crude imports and ambition to be a global financial centre, the government has a strong strategic interest in ensuring the new contract becomes a successful benchmark. The new crude contract has some distinctive characteristics and restrictions that have drawn adverse comment (“China aims to challenge Brent, WTI oil with crude futures launch”, Reuters, March 23). There are strict limits on the number of cancelled orders to curb spoofing but which may deter computer-driven high-frequency traders. Trading is restricted to three distinct periods each day, rather than being nearly continuous, and there will be lengthy non-trading periods during national holidays. But most of these restrictions have a sound rationale, including concentrating liquidity, and they are likely to be relaxed as the contract becomes more established. None of them appears likely to deter liquidity. China’s new crude futures are unlikely to displace the Brent and WTI light sweet benchmarks in the United States and Europe. But they have a fair chance of successfully becoming a regional benchmark for the medium and heavy sour crudes favoured by refiners in Asia (“Shanghai crude futures complete globalisation of oil markets”, Reuters, March 28).

The shallow quake struck close to the coast, around 100 miles (162 km) southwest of Rabaul, a much more remote region than the country’s mountainous mainland highlands where a magnitude 7.5 tremor struck on Feb. 26, killing 100 people. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre (PTWC) issued a threat warning for the country’s coastline located within 300 km of the quake’s epicenter, but later advised that the threat had passed. Dellie Minding, a receptionist at the Rabaul Hotel in the east of New Britain, around 20 minutes from the coast, told Reuters that the earthquake was felt, with many guests running outside, but there was no damage. At the Rapopo Plantation Resort on the coast, receptionist May Dovon said she had not heard of any casualties or damage. “We felt the earthquake, everything was moving so we went out of the building,” Dovon told Reuters. “Nothing was damaged.” Australian authorities said there was no threat to the Australian coastline from the quake, which was initially reported as a magnitude 7.2. Quakes are common in Papua New Guinea, which sits on the Pacific’s “Ring of Fire”, a hotspot for seismic activity due to friction between tectonic plates. Rabaul lies in the shadow of Mount Tavurvur, an active volcano that destroyed the town in 1994 during a severe eruption.  The latest quake came as Papua New Guinea struggles to get aid to survivors of the Feb. 26 quake, which flattened whole villages and spoiled water supplies on the country’s main island. The impoverished country is also missing its largest revenue earner since the quake forced a shutdown of Exxon Mobil Corp’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, which has annual sales of $3 billion at current LNG prices. The company is still assessing quake damage at its facilities.   Reporting by Jane Wardell and Alison Bevege in SYDNEY.

2018-03-30,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday dismissed Exxon Mobil Corp’s (XOM.N) lawsuit seeking to stop New York and Massachusetts from probing whether the oil and gas company covered up its knowledge about climate change and lied to investors and the public about it. U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni in Manhattan rejected as “implausible” Exxon’s argument that the states’ Democratic attorneys general, Eric Schneiderman and Maura Healey, were pursuing politically motivated, bad faith fraud investigations  in order to violate its constitutional rights. Caproni dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, meaning the Irving, Texas-based company cannot bring it again. Exxon is evaluating its legal options, spokesman Scott Silvestri said in an email. “We believe the risk of climate change is real and we want to be part of the solution,” he added. “We’ve invested about $8 billion on energy efficiency and low-emission technologies such as carbon capture and next generation biofuels.” The case is one of several, including shareholder and employee lawsuits, centered on whether Exxon has for decades lied about climate change, including its impact on energy prices and the environment and its ability to develop reserves, and taken public positions inconsistent with what it knew. Schneiderman, in a statement, welcomed the end of what he called Exxon’s “frivolous, nonsensical lawsuit that wrongfully attempted to thwart a serious state law enforcement investigation.” Healey called Caproni’s decision “a turning point in our investigation and a victory for the people.” Exxon sued in June 2016, after receiving subpoenas seeking documents about its historical understanding of climate change, and communications with interest groups and shareholders. The company accused Schneiderman and Healey of conspiring to “silence and intimidate one side of the public policy debate,” violating its rights to free speech and due process and against unreasonable searches. Much of Exxon’s case was based on a March 2016 news conference with the attorneys general and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, which it called a bid to coerce its adoption of policies that they and climate change activists preferred. Caproni, however, said “nothing that was said can fairly be read to constitute declaration of a political vendetta against Exxon.” She said the belief by Schneiderman and Healey, “apparently” shared by Exxon, that climate change is real does not mean they had no reason to believe Exxon may have fraudulently “sowed confusion” to bolster its bottom line. Nowhere, she said, did Exxon suggest that the attorneys general believed the company “was itself confused about the causes or risks of climate change.” The case is Exxon Mobil Corp et al v Schneiderman et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-02301.
