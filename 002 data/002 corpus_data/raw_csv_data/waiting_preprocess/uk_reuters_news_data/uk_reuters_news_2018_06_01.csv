2018-06-01,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices retreated on Friday after the dollar rose on better-than-expected U.S. employment data, which pressured greenback-denominated commodities, including crude. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell $1.23 a barrel to settle at $65.81 a barrel. For the week, WTI was on track to drop about 3 percent, adding to last week’s near 5 percent decline. Global benchmark Brent LCOc1 fell 77 cents to $76.79 a barrel. It was set for a 0.4 percent gain for the week. WTI’s discount to Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1 widened, settling at $11.02 a barrel after ballooning to as much $11.57 during the session, largest since 2015. Domestic job growth accelerated in May and the unemployment rate dropped to an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. The U.S. Labor Department’s report also showed solid wage gains, which boosted expectations that the Federal Reserve would hike interest rates in June and later this year as well. [FRX/] The strengthening dollar .DXY sparked selling in dollar-denominated commodities, said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management.  Concerns about growing U.S. crude production and a glut trapped inland due to a lack of pipeline capacity have pressured prices of WTI, doubling its discount to Brent over the course of a month. U.S. crude production rose in March by to 10.47 million barrels per day (bpd), a monthly record, the Energy Information Administration said on Thursday. On a weekly basis, it rose to 10.8 million bpd last week, close to top producer Russia, the EIA said. [EIA/S] “The weekly number suggests U.S. production is really strong and continuing to rip higher,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. But without adequate transportation to get crude to the coasts, “we’re going to continue to see some weakness in WTI,” he said.  U.S. drillers added two oil rigs in the week to June 1, bringing the total to 861, the most since March 2015, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. That was the eighth time drillers added rigs in the past nine weeks. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their bullish wagers on U.S. crude futures and options in the week to May 29, as prices dropped by about 7 percent, according to data released by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday. The speculator group cut its combined futures and options position in New York and London by 50,937 contracts to 370,980 during the week.  Speculators in Brent crude LCOc1 cut their net long positions in the week by 49,638 contracts to 451,966.

2018-06-01,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stocks and the U.S. dollar rose while Treasury debt prices fell on Friday as investors welcomed a stronger-than-expected American jobs report and an apparent end to a political crisis in Italy, although prospects for a full-blown global trade war limited the gains. The MSCI All-Country World index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.81 percent. Still, it was set for a third week of losses, brought on by earlier risks of a snap election in Italy. The robust U.S. jobs report locked in expectations of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve this month and sent U.S. stocks higher.  Nonfarm payrolls increased by 223,000 jobs in May, while average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in April. The unemployment rate dropped to an 18-year low of 3.8 percent.     “The takeaway is the economy is doing nicely,” said Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors Inc. “Inflation is exactly where they want it to be,” he said of the Fed. The good news helped names like Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), and Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) resume their role leading indexes higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 219.37 points, or 0.9 percent, to 24,635.21, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 29.35 points, or 1.08 percent, to 2,734.62 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 112.22 points, or 1.51 percent, to 7,554.33. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR fell 21/32 in price to yield 2.8985 percent, from 2.822 percent late on Thursday. Leaders of Italy’s anti-establishment parties revived coalition plans late on Thursday, apparently ending three months of political turmoil. The new government was being installed on Friday. That sent stocks broadly higher as government borrowing costs moved lower in Europe. [.EU] Of potentially greater concern to investors was the renewed prospect of a global trade war after the United States imposed steel and aluminium tariffs on Canada, Mexico and the European Union. Canada and Mexico retaliated with levies on billions of dollars of U.S. goods from orange juice to pork. The European Union was set to tax bourbon and Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N) motorcycles. The biggest hurdle for U.S. exports may be the climbing dollar. An index of the greenback against its trading partners .DXY rose 0.22 percent. The Canadian dollar fell 0.01 percent and the Mexican peso lost 0.09 percent versus the U.S. dollar. Both currencies fell on Thursday after the U.S. decision to impose tariffs. [FRX/] The strong dollar weighed on oil prices, which are quoted in the currency. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell $1.23 a barrel to settle at $65.81 a barrel. Global benchmark Brent LCOc1 fell 77 cents to $76.79 a barrel. Brent crude oil futures contracts and U.S. WTI hit its widest for three years before narrowing. [O/R] But Brent is still nearly 30 percent above its lows for this year, heaping pressure on emerging markets already taxed by the rising dollar and, now, accelerating withdrawals by foreign investors. Investors globally pulled $2 billion from emerging market stock funds in the most recent week ended Wednesday, the most since the last week of 2016, according to research service EPFR Global. Brazilian financial markets dropped on Friday after the chief executive officer of Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA) resigned, driving down shares in the state-controlled oil company as much as 21 percent. The Brazilian real BRL= weakened 1.01 percent against the greenback.

2018-06-01,"ABUJA, June 1 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s central bank said on Friday it had injected $331.41 million into the interbank foreign exchange market, continuing its efforts to boost liquidity and alleviate dollar shortages. The bank said the funds were allocated to companies in the agricultural, airline, petroleum and machinery sectors. The central bank is “buoyant enough to meet the foreign exchange requests of various customers cut across the different segments of the market”, said its spokesman Isaac Okorafor. Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil producer, fell into recession in 2016 largely due to low crude prices. Lower oil revenues led to foreign currency shortages because crude sales are the country’s main source of foreign exchange. It emerged from recession last year as crude prices recovered, but it has maintained a system of multiple exchange rates in an attempt to reduce pressure on the local naira currency.

2018-06-01,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to take emergency steps to keep coal and nuclear power plants running, the White House said Friday, in what would amount to an unprecedented intervention in U.S. power markets.  The White House billed the effort as a way to shore up national energy security, but the announcement triggered swift backlash from an unusual alliance of drillers, renewable energy producers and environmentalists who called it an unfair attempt to prop up non-competitive industries. “Unfortunately, impending retirements of fuel-secure power facilities are leading to a rapid depletion of a critical part of our nation’s energy mix, and impacting the resilience of our power grid,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement about the measure.      Since campaigning for the White House, Trump has vowed to revive the ailing U.S. coal industry. Both the U.S. coal and nuclear power industries have been shrinking for years, under pressure from cheaper natural gas along with advances in solar and wind energy. As part of the plan, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) could exercise emergency authority under national security laws to direct the operators to buy electricity from coal and nuclear facilities, according to a memo reviewed by Reuters. (bit.ly/2LPCTp3) Details of the memo, dated May 29 and circulated ahead of a National Security Council meeting on the subject on Friday, were first reported by Bloomberg News late on Thursday. Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a major coal-mining state, on Friday praised Trump for carrying out what he said was his idea: “I am glad President Trump and his Administration are considering my idea to use the Defense Production Act to save coal-fired power plants with emissions controls and protect our national security,” Manchin said.  The Defense Production Act, adopted in 1950 at the start of the Korean War, allows the federal government to intervene in business to promote national security. A coalition of oil, gas, solar, wind and energy efficiency trade groups, however, on Friday released joint statements on the move, calling the proposed action “misguided.”   “We strongly urge the administration to reject this ill-conceived draft plan and adopt a policy approach that promotes market forces and competition in our nation’s power system,” Todd Snitchler, director of market development at the American Petroleum Institute, said. The administration has said it is concerned the retirement of old coal and nuclear plants could put U.S. power supplies at risk because - unlike solar, wind, and natural gas power facilities - coal and nuclear generators can store fuel on site. But federal energy regulators have rejected that argument and turned down a proposal late last year from Perry to subsidize nuclear and coal plants for providing “resilience” to the grid. That did not stop the coal industry from making new requests for help from the administration. In late March, FirstEnergy’s (FE.N) FirstEnergy Solutions [FE.UL] unit - which runs coal and nuclear power units - called on the U.S. energy secretary to use the emergency powers to lift the sectors. Coal company CEO Robert Murray of Murray Energy [MUYEY.UL], also called for Perry to use emergency powers to save at-risk coal plants. Analysts said the new plan would face numerous legal and political challenges before it could get implemented. “While we believe DOE has broad privileges to identify threats to national security, we are skeptical that (the order) entitles DOE to direct power market operators (...) to pay generators more based upon that threat,” said Katie Bays, energy analyst at Height Capital Markets in Washington. “Litigation would begin almost immediately,” she said. Earlier this year, east coast grid operator PJM, which serves 65 million customers, published an analysis of recently announced planned deactivations of certain nuclear plants and determined that there was no immediate threat to system reliability. “There is no need for any such drastic action,” said a PJM spokesperson about the new idea.

2018-06-01,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro went out on a limb to support a truckers strike that paralysed Brazil and forced the government to reinstate costly fuel subsidies, and the strategy may have helped his chances of beating one of several pro-business reform candidates in October’s election. The scale of the truckers’ stoppage overwhelmed President Michel Temer’s unpopular government, which was pressured into granting truckers’ demands as airports ran out of fuel, grocery shelves emptied and drivers waited hours to fill their tanks. Despite these disruptions, truckers won support from many Brazilians angry at a surge in diesel prices since state oil company Petrobras scrapped subsidies under Temer. An opinion poll on Wednesday found that 87 percent of Brazilians supported the strike. Centrist candidates such as former Sao Paulo governor Geraldo Alckmin and ruling party candidate Henrique Meirelles did not come out in support of the truckers when they blocked Brazil’s main highways. There has been no poll on voter intentions yet to show whether lack of support for the strike hurt these politicians, who back further fiscal belt-tightening that many voters oppose but investors would like to see. Bolsonaro, 63, a former army captain turned congressman running on an anti-graft platform, praised the truckers in social media messages for fighting “extortionist” taxes levied by Temer’s “corrupt” government. Ahead of the Oct. 7 election, Bolsonaro had just under 20 percent support, giving him the lead in polls that exclude jailed leftist ex-president Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, who received 32 percent support in one poll even though he cannot run due to a graft conviction.  Bolsonaro’s strong support in a crowded field has alarmed moderate politicians and unnerved some investors. But with Brazil slow to recover from its most painful recession in decades, many voters believe Temer’s government has ignored the hardships of ordinary people. This has led analysts and politicians to say this year’s election may come down to a choice between the far left and the far right. During the strike, many truckers displayed placards expressing support for Bolsonaro.    “The government handled this strike so badly,” said Lorivan Carvalho, a federal employee who spent two hours waiting in a line of cars at a gas station in Brasilia. “Bolsonaro gained points by backing the truckers.” The protest, which wound down this week after Temer reintroduced subsidies, demonstrated the unpopularity of Temer’s efforts to liberalize Latin America’s largest economy. Many Brazilians, tired of violent crime and corruption among mainstream parties, have been drawn to Bolsonaro’s hardline pledges. For instance, the candidate said he would appoint five generals to his cabinet and would give police “carte blanche” to kill delinquents who shoot at them. Brazil has some 60,000 gun-related deaths a year.    Congressman Major Olimpio, one of Bolsonaro’s campaign managers, told Reuters the strike was a vote winner for his candidate who had emerged as “the only credible politician”, whereas Temer’s free-market policies were blamed for the crisis. If no candidate wins a majority in the first round, a runoff between the two leaders will be held on Oct. 28. Even political rivals conceded that Bolsonaro’s odds are improving.  “If he continues with this level of support and the centre remains divided, Bolsonaro could reach the runoff,” said Congressman Fabio Sousa of the centrist Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB). Bolsonaro holds nationalist views of economic development of the kind implemented by Brazil’s 1964-1985 military dictatorship and has opposed the privatisation of state companies. He also has been indicted by federal prosecutors on hate speech charges. Yet in an overture to the business community, he picked investment banker Paulo Guedes as his economic advisor, a free-marketeer who would sell off everything from Petrobras to state banks and the post office. Some business leaders in the world’s eighth largest economy may view him as the lesser evil if he is in a runoff with the leading leftist candidate, fiery former state governor Ciro Gomes. “The market likes Guedes but doubts he can apply his ideas in a Bolsonaro government,” said the manager of a Brazilian investment fund, speaking on the condition he was not identified. “The market does not prefer Bolsonaro but might have to accept him.” Frustration with how the Temer government handled the strike added to popular anger at a political establishment discredited by graft investigations. More than 120 powerful politicians and businessmen are now behind bars.     The truckers protest weakened Temer more than anything else since he took power more than two years ago following the impeachment of leftist Dilma Rousseff. Temer, 77, is the first sitting Brazilian president to be charged with corruption.  His approval ratings have sunk to around 4 percent, even lower than that of President Nicolas Maduro of neighbouring Venezuela, hit by hyperinflation and food shortages. This has dashed hopes that Temer’s lame duck government can push through Congress business friendly measures such as the privatisation of Brazil’s largest utility, Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, known as Eletrobras.    “That was a already a tough sell. Now it becomes almost impossible,” said Lucas de Aragão, partner at the political consultancy Arko Advice. Former Ceará state governor Ciro Gomes has emerged as the most likely standard bearer for Brazil’s left, with just under 10 percent. Aragão believes many voters view Gomes as part of the establishment, while Bolsonaro will gain ground from the truck crisis because he is perceived as an outsider. “The truckers’ strike knocked down the last pillar of hope Temer’s government had of electing a successor that will continue its policies,” said Rafael Cortez, chief analyst at Tendencias consultancy, who sees little chance of a moderate like Meirelles winning.    “This climate of radicalisation benefits the extremes,” Cortez said.

2018-06-01,"June 1 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies added oil rigs for a second week in a row even though crude prices have declined about 7 percent over the past two weeks and analysts do not expect any big changes in the rig count for the rest of the year. Drillers added two oil rigs in the week to June 1, bringing the total count to 861, the highest level since March 2015, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI That was the eighth time drillers added rigs in the past nine weeks. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is much higher than a year ago when 733 rigs were active as energy companies have been ramping up production in tandem with OPEC’s efforts to cut global output in a bid to take advantage of rising prices. U.S. crude futures fell below $66 a barrel this week, their lowest level since April 17, as U.S. output comes close to matching that of top dog Russia. Just last week, U.S. futures traded over $72 a barrel, their highest since November 2014. U.S. crude oil production hit a record 10.8 million barrels per day (bpd) last week, while on a monthly basis, it peaked at 10.47 million bpd in March, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in separate reports on Thursday. Production in Texas rose by 4 percent to almost 4.2 million bpd, a record high based on the data going back to 2005. The Permian basin, which stretches across West Texas and eastern New Mexico, is the largest U.S. oilfield. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast average total oil and natural gas rig count would rise to 1,025 in 2018 and 1,125 in 2019. Last week, Simmons forecast the count would rise to 1,020 in 2018 and 1,125 in 2019. With the boost in rigs so far this year, analysts were not as bullish on further increases. Since 1,060 oil and gas rigs were currently in service, drillers would not have to add any more rigs for the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. So far this year, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 993, up sharply from 2017’s average of 876. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading below $66 for the balance of 2018 and nearly $63 for calendar 2019 . In anticipation of higher prices, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies they track have provided guidance indicating a 13 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said those E&Ps expect to spend a total of $81.2 billion in 2018, up from an estimated $72.1 billion in 2017. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-06-01,"* Nigeria set to see IPOs again * IPOs virtually dried up after a 2008 crash * Exception was oil company Seplat which listed in 2014 * Aviation firm, resinsurer, oil company and MTN set to list By Chijioke Ohuocha LAGOS, June 1 (Reuters) - More companies are lining up to list on the Lagos stock exchange, kick starting Nigeria’s IPO market after a long drought. Sources familiar with matter said two companies - Skyway Aviation Handling Company (SAHCOL) and Nigerian Reinsurance Corporation - were preparing for initial public offerings this year, while Singapore-owned Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals Ltd planned a public float in Lagos next year. They follow on the heels of South Africa’s MTN which has said it plans to list its Nigerian unit this year but has not set a date. IPOs dried up in Nigeria after a 2008 crash, aggravated by the global financial crisis, wiped more than 60 percent off the stock market’s capitalization. The benchmark share index has since recovered, gaining 42 percent last year but IPOs have yet to resume, apart from oil company Seplat’s dual listing in Lagos and London in 2014. SAHCOL is going through the regulatory process ahead of a planned IPO in August when core investors will sell a stake, while Nigerian Reinsurance aims for an IPO in November in which the government will sell part of its stake, the sources said. “I’m expecting more transactions out of Africa in the equity markets, both in Nigeria and across Africa,” Miguel Azevedo, Citibank’s managing director and head of investment banking, Middle East and Africa, said. “I think at the end of the year we will see that 2018 was the biggest year for African IPOs since the financial crisis.” Alex Okoh, director general of the Bureau of Public Enterprises, said the government has 11 assets it plans to either concession or sell to strategic investors this year, ranging from power assets to sports stadiums. Nigeria’s stock market rose 16 percent in the first quarter, helped by rising oil prices, but has recently seen a sell off and is down 0.4 percent year to date as rising U.S. interest rates hit emerging markets and due to political risk ahead of a presidential election next February.

2018-06-01,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican will host executives of the world’s top oil companies for a conference next week on climate change and the transition away from fossil fuels, a Vatican source said on Friday. Pope Francis, who wrote a major document on protection of the environment from global warming in 2015, is expected to address the group on the last day of the June 8-9 conference. The conference, organised by the University of Notre Dame in the United States, is expected to be attended by the heads or senior executives of companies including Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Eni (ENI.MI), BP (BP.L), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Pemex, the source said. The chief executive officers of Exxon, BP (BP.L) and Norway’s Equinor (EQNR.OL) will attend the event, the companies confirmed. Shell declined to comment. The oil and gas industry has come under increasing pressure from investors and activists to play a bigger role in reducing the emission of greenhouse gases in order to meet goals set out in a 2015 climate agreement signed in Paris. Companies are betting on increased demand for gas, the least polluting fossil fuel, and to a lesser extent on renewable power such as wind and solar, to meet global targets of net zero emissions by the end of the century. “We’re hopeful that this kind of dialogue can help develop solutions to the dual challenge of managing the risks of climate change while meeting growing demand for energy, which is critical to alleviating poverty and raising living standards in the developing world,” Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri said. The conference, titled “Energy Transition and Care for Our Common Home,” will be held in the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, a 16th century villa in the Vatican gardens known as the Casina Pio IV. In the 2015 encyclical, called “Laudato Si (Praise Be), On the Care of Our Common Home,” Francis, the first pope from a developing nation, advocated a change of lifestyle in rich countries steeped in a “throwaway” consumer culture and an end to an “obstructionist attitudes” that sometimes put profit before the common good. In several passages in the six-chapter encyclical, Francis confronted head-on both climate change doubters and those who say it is not man-made. He said there was a “very solid scientific consensus” that the planet was warming and that people had to “combat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it” because greenhouse gases were “released mainly as a result of human activity.” Francis called for policies to drastically reduce polluting gases, saying technology based on fossil fuels “needs to be progressively replaced without delay” and sources of renewable energy developed. One of the key architects of the pope’s encyclical, Cardinal Peter Turkson, head of the Vatican’s department on promoting  human development and a firm backer of the need to stem global warming, will address the group, the source said. Last year, Francis, who strongly supported the Paris agreement on climate change, implicitly criticised the United States for pulling out of the accord. The chancellor of the academy where the conference will be held, Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, called the U.S. withdrawal a “huge slap in the face” for the Vatican. News of the conference was first reported by the Axios news service.

2018-06-01,"PARIS (Reuters) - French oil major Total (TOTF.PA) is continuing talks with farmers opposed to its planned La Mede biodiesel refinery and plans to use 50,000 tonnes of French rapeseed to supply the facility, Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said on Friday. Pouyanne said the launch of the plant, expected in early September, was on schedule despite a call by a farm union to block oil refineries in France over a decision to allow Total to use imported palm oil as a feedstock at La Mede. FNSEA, France’s largest farmers’ union, on Thursday called for the nationwide blockade from June 10. Total has said feedstock for the 500,000 tonnes per year refinery will be made up of around 60 to 70 percent vegetable oil, and around 30 to 40 percent from animal fat, used cooking oil and residue from used palm oil. The 60 to 70 percent of vegetable oil will include palm oil, rapeseed oil, sunflower oil and soy oil. Pouyanne told journalists on the sidelines of a Total shareholder meeting in Paris that the company had identified around 100,000 tonnes of animal fat to be used in place of palm oil, cutting palm oil usage to below 300,000 tonnes. “I think we have a solid business case for the biorefinery,” Pouyanne said, adding Total would continue talks with farmers and had decided to buy 50,000 tonnes of French rapeseed per year for the plant. “Sincerely, the 50,000 tonnes is not most profitable in the feedstock that will go into the refinery,” he said. France consumes around 3 million tonnes of biodiesel per year and produces about 50 percent of that in France, importing the rest including 750,000 tonnes from southeast Asia and Argentina. “Our project represents around 500,000 tonnes ... the La Mede refinery project will make France a lot more independent,” Pouyanne said.

2018-06-01,"PRINCETON, West Virginia (Reuters) - As a young man, Barry Shrewsbury dug coal in the West Virginia mines and spent his time off hunting and fishing in the rolling hills. Now, at 62, he struggles to breathe and accomplish basic tasks such as shopping and showering, and relies on a federal fund for ex-miners with black lung disease to pay for an oxygen tank and doctor visits. “The benefits are a lifeline,” Shrewsbury said between laboured breaths after a treatment at the Bluestone Health Center, an industrial-style building set against a leafy landscape in Princeton, West Virginia. That lifeline is threatened. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund is at risk of insolvency due to soaring debt and a slashing of coal-company contributions through a tax cut scheduled for the end of the year, according to a report the U.S. Government Accountability Office plans to publish soon, two sources briefed on the study told Reuters. That shortfall - which comes as black lung rates hit highs not seen in decades - could force the fund to restrict benefits or shift some of the financial burden to taxpayers, the sources said on condition of anonymity. The fund currently provides medical coverage and monthly payments for living expenses to more than 15,000 people, according to a Congressional report published this year.  (For a graphic on rising black-lung rates, see: tmsnrt.rs/2IHoOIf . For a WIDER IMAGE photo essay, see: reut.rs/2Lbj4HI .) The coal industry, meanwhile, is lobbying Congress to ensure the scheduled tax reduction goes forward, arguing the payments have already been too high at a difficult time for mining companies and that the fund has been abused by undeserving applicants. “More often than not, we are being called upon to provide compensation for previous or current smokers,” said Bruce Watzman, head of regulatory affairs for the National Mining Association.  He said that view was based on “discussions with those administering this program for companies” and initially said he had no research on black-lung benefits paying for smoking-related diseases.  Watzman later cited a study from 1989 by the University of Louisville School of Medicine. The researchers examined 1,000 black-lung benefit applications and found that coal miners judged ""potentially eligible"" for benefits smoked at higher rates that those who did not qualify. (here) Medical experts dispute the association’s argument, saying the disease - an incurable illness caused by inhaling coal dust - is easy to distinguish with x-rays. “It is not caused by smoking,” said Dr. David Blackley, head of Respiratory Disease Studies at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The Labor Department, which manages the fund, considers all potential causes of an applicant’s lung problems before awarding benefits, said Amy Louviere, a spokeswoman for the department’s Mine Safety and Health Administration. The approval rate for applications was about 20 percent last year, according to department data. Coal companies are currently required to pay a $1.10 per ton excise tax on underground coal production to finance the fund. That amount will revert to the 1977 level of 50 cents at the end of the year if Congress does not extend the current rate. The fund has already been forced to borrow more than $6 billion from the U.S. Treasury to finance benefits during the life of the program, according to the Treasury Department. About half of the fund’s revenue now goes to servicing that debt.  A bipartisan effort by lawmakers to extend the current coal tax failed this year after the mining association lobbied Republican House leadership not to take it up. Watzman said he was “not at liberty” to identify members of Congress who oppose extending the tax. Matt Sparks, a spokesman for House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s office, did not respond to requests for comment. Lawmakers expect discussion of the tax to resume after the GAO report is released. “We need to take care of the miners,” said Virginia Republican Congressman Morgan Griffith, who represents a district that has seen one of the biggest surges in the disease. “We first need to have all facts on the table.” The mining association and large miners such as Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, and Consol Energy are already pressing their case, according to Congressional lobbying records that show the black lung fund among the subjects discussed in their recent meetings with lawmakers. Peabody spokeswoman Michelle Constantine declined to comment. Arch spokesman Logan Bonacorsi and Consol spokesman Zachary Smith did not respond to requests for comment. The upcoming GAO report was requested in 2016 by Democratic Congressmen Bobby Scott of Virginia and Sander Levin of Michigan and has undergone review by the administration of President Donald Trump, who has focused on slashing regulation to help the coal industry. White House spokeswoman Kelly Love did not respond to a request for comment on the administration’s position on the excise tax. The fund pays benefits to miners severely disabled by black lung in cases where no coal company can be found to directly provide support. That typically occurs when a company has gone belly-up – an increasingly common scenario as the nation’s utilities shift to cheaper natural gas and cleaner solar and wind power. Some 2,600 medical claims were transferred from companies to the fund in 2017 due to bankruptcies, according to a Congressional report this year. Government research shows the incidence of black lung rebounding, despite improved safety measures adopted decades ago - such as dust screens and ventilation – that had nearly eradicated the disease in the 1990s. In February, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health confirmed 416 cases of advanced black lung disease in three medical clinics in rural Virginia from 2013 to 2017 - the highest concentration of cases ever seen. It also confirmed a 2016-2017 investigation by National Public Radio that found many hundreds more cases in southwestern Virginia, southern West Virginia and eastern Kentucky.  “This is history moving in the wrong direction,” said Kirsten Almberg, an assistant professor of environmental and occupational health at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Almberg authored an analysis of Labor Department data showing that nearly half the 4,679 benefits claims from miners with the worst form of black lung disease were made since 2000. Ex-miners and regional health experts blame the resurgence on longer hours spent in deeper parts of old, played-out mines, along with lax safety measures and the use of heavy machines to blast through layers of rock.  “We didn’t use curtains. We rarely used ventilators. We thought we were invincible,” said Greg Jones, who left mining in March and now coordinates benefits applications at the Tug River Black Lung Clinic in Gary, West Virginia. Brandon Crum, a radiologist at the United Medical Group in Pikeville, Kentucky, said he has personally diagnosed more than 150 cases of advanced black lung disease since 2016, many in younger miners.  Crum, whose own family worked the mines for a century, said many of these people face a lifetime unable to work, inundated with medical bills.  “Any kind of asset or financial stability you would take away from these miners and their families would be devastating,” he said. To qualify for benefits, a miner must apply to the Department of Labor, which screens the applications based on medical and employment documentation and then tries to find a responsible coal company to pay the costs.  Jim Werth, the black lung clinic director at Stone Mountain Health Services in St. Charles, Virginia, said his clinic has three people on staff helping patients file for benefits. He rejected the idea that the fund was covering undeserving applicants, saying the process already makes it hard to qualify, with coal companies often hiring doctors to dispute medical test results. William McCool, 64, said it took him years to win benefits. “I worked 40 years in the mines, and the benefits don’t come automatic,” said McCool, who wore a gray baseball cap emblazoned with a crossing pick-axe and shovel during an interview at the Mountain Health Center in Whitesburg, Kentucky, where he receives oxygen and physical therapy. Kennith Adams - a 62-year-old former miner who survived stage-four colon cancer and is now suffering advanced black lung - had his first application rejected two years ago, he said. Consol argued he did not work for the firm when he became ill. Adams had worked at the Bishop Coal Company, which later got taken over by Consol. Consol did not respond to a request for comment. Adams and his wife Tammie are now hoping his latest application - sent last month - will be approved to help them pay medical bills of more than $12,000 a month.  “If he doesn’t get his medicine,” his wife said, “he doesn’t stand a chance.” Reporting by Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Brian Thevenot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-coal-blacklung/insight-us-coal-lobby-fights-black-lung-tax-as-disease-rates-surge-idUKL2N1T313Z,01 Jun 2018,"As a young man,

2018-06-01,"(Corrects name of director in par 12) By Sophie Hares GRAND ANSE, Grenada, June 1 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - C aribbean countries should dive into the “blue economy” to exploit marine resources, giving their economies a much needed boost, while protecting coastal eco-systems, economists said. The island nations - which have 80 times more sea than land - been hampered by low growth and high debt, and they will need to attract financing to develop sectors like ocean renewable energy and marine biotechnology, they said. “We very much see the blue economy as fundamentally central for the Caribbean region’s economic growth,” said Tahseen Sayed, the World Bank director for Caribbean countries, in a speech. The value of global oceans is estimated to be $24 trillion, the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) said in its “Financing the Blue Economy” report, released Thursday at its annual board of governors meeting in Grenada. That estimate was based on activities such as fishing, tourism, transport and carbon sequestration, which refers to the storage of carbon dioxide and other forms of carbon as a strategy to mitigate the effects of climate change. Capitalising on newer areas of the so-called blue economy, such as using the oceans to generate energy, could help drive economic growth in the region where one person in five lives in poverty, said the report. “We’ve been unable to fully harness the potential of these resources,” Roger McLeod, CDB economist and report co-author, told the conference. Private investors would be willing to put money into well-structured deals, but the region needs to create a unified policy to drive the sector and make it easier for people to invest, said speakers. The Nature Conservancy, a U.S.-based group, proposed that Caribbean nations negotiate debt-for-nature deals, as it has done with the Seychelles. The East African island nation designated a third of its marine area as “protected” in return for The Nature Conservancy agreeing to buy up nearly $22 million of its outstanding $406 million sovereign debt. Grenada, which has 26,000 sq kms (10,000 sq miles) of ocean within its territory, is one country now negotiating a debt-for-nature swap as part of its Blue Growth Coastal Master Plan. Related projects could also involve funding to improve fisheries, and develop sustainable energy, said Rob Weary, a senior director at NatureVest, which funds deals for The Nature Conservancy. “The private sector capital is interested in the debt restructuring work because of the cash-flow it creates for conservation,” Weary told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. He said renewable energy projects would be likely to attract investors. ""It's a true impact,"" said Weary. ""They get their money back with a return and you generate all this cash for the environment."" (Reporting by Sophie Hares; editing by Jared Ferrie.

2018-06-01,"* Stocks ,and dollar rise, bonds fall on U.S. jobs data * Easing Italy worries help risk markets in Europe * Trade war fears resurface after fresh U.S. tariffs (Updates to U.S. market open; changes dateline, previous LONDON) By Trevor Hunnicutt NEW YORK, June 1 (Reuters) - World stocks rose and bond prices fell on Friday as investors welcomed a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report and an apparent end to a political crisis in Italy, although prospects for a full-blown global trade war limited the gains. The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.74 percent. Still, it was set for a third week of losses, brought on by earlier risks of a snap election in Italy. The robust U.S. jobs report locked in expectations of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve this month and sent U.S. stocks higher. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 223,000 jobs in May, while the average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in April. The unemployment rate dropped to an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. “The job numbers are very strong, widespread, or broad based, that was an indication of strength from the report,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “The really good news for markets is the average hourly earnings continues to be very steady and does not signal a buildup in inflationary pressures, so overall a very solid report.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 203.69 points, or 0.83 percent, to 24,619.53, the S&P 500 gained 25.8 points, or 0.95 percent, to 2,731.07 and the Nasdaq Composite added 92.60 points, or 1.24 percent, to 7,534.72. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell 19/32 in price to yield 2.8894 percent, from 2.822 percent late Thursday. Leaders of Italy’s anti-establishment parties revived coalition plans late on Thursday, apparently ending three months of political turmoil. The new government was being installed on Friday. Italian stocks rallied 1.63 percent, the standout performers in Europe. The political crisis knocked more than 9 percent off the Italian benchmark in May, its worst month since June 2016. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 1.18 percent. Italian two-year yields, which soared to five-year highs above 2.7 percent on Tuesday, rose in price on Friday to yield 1.038 percent. Of potentially greater concern to investors was the renewed prospect of a global trade war after the United States imposed steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada, Mexico and the European Union. Canada and Mexico retaliated with levies on billions of dollars of U.S. goods from orange juice to pork. The European Union was set to tax bourbon whiskey and Harley Davidson motorcycles. The U.S. dollar climbed against the yen. The Canadian dollar rose 0.04 percent and the Mexican peso gained 0.26 percent versus the U.S. dollar. Both currencies fell on Thursday after the U.S. decision to impose tariffs. U.S. crude fell 0.81 percent to $66.50 per barrel and Brent was last at $76.80, down 0.98 percent. The spread between Brent crude oil futures contracts and U.S. WTI stood at its widest for three years. Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt

2018-06-01,"* Iranian oil attractive due to discount * Indian delegation to visit Europe from Monday * India, Europe to explore ways to protect trade with Iran By Nidhi Verma NEW DELHI, June 1 (Reuters) - Indian state refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp has requested an extra one million barrels of oil from the National Iranian Oil Co. (NIOC) for June, two industry sources said, amid a looming threat of stringent U.S. sanctions. The move by BPCL indicates that refiners will try to frontload their purchases from Iran ahead of a November U.S. deadline for re-imposing sanctions on the country’s petroleum sector. Uncertainties cloud Iran’s oil exports after U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned a 2015 nuclear agreement this month and ordered the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions on Tehran. Some sanctions take effect after a 90-day “wind-down” period ending on Aug. 6, and the rest, notably on the petroleum sector, after a 180-day “wind-down period” ending on Nov. 4. “At this point of time Iranian crude is attractive ... it is faring better than spot cargoes and other crudes,” said one of the sources. Iran has agreed to provide almost free shipping to Indian refiners in 2018/19, an incentive that significantly reduces the landed cost of Iranian oil compared to rival regional grades. “When the going is good, BPCL thought it should take it,” this source said. BPCL did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment. India is Iran’s top oil client after China and was one of the few nations that continued to trade with Tehran during the previous round of Western sanctions as New Delhi follows only the restrictions imposed by United Nations. So far India’s oil imports and payment mechanism have not been hit by the threat of U.S. sanctions. India’s Reliance Industries Ltd, owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, plans to halt oil imports from Iran, two sources familiar with the matter said this week, in a sign that new U.S. sanctions are forcing buyers to shun oil purchases from Tehran. Reliance’s move is expected to take effect in October or November. An Indian delegation with officials from the finance, petroleum and foreign ministries will visit European nations for a week from Monday to explore ways to continue to trade with Iran despite U.S. sanctions, a government official said. European states have been scrambling to save the 2015 nuclear deal and planning a package of economic relief to persuade Iran to stay in the deal. “Europe has taken a position, which is different this time. This time we are in the same boat,” this official said. The Indian delegation would visit France, Germany, Britain and Brussels to meet governments and bankers. Currently India settles oil payments in euros through Germany’s EIH Bank. “(It’s) not only oil imports, we (European nations and India) are also impacted by concomitant things like banking. We will discuss all these and the way forward,” the official added. The Indian delegation’s trip to Europe follows the visit of Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif to India this week. India and Iran want to continue their bilateral trade. Reporting by Nidhi Verma; Additional reporting by Promit

2018-06-01,"(Reuters) - Lululemon Athletica Inc’s (LULU.O) shares hit a record high on Friday after the athletic apparel maker raised its full-year profit forecast as customers flocked to its revamped stores. Shares of the Canadian company, which popularized “athleisure wear” by turning pricey women’s yoga wear into mainstream fashion, were up nearly 15.5 percent at $121.26 in morning trading. Lululemon’s shares rose as much as 15.3 percent to $121.15, boosting the company’s market cap by about $3 billion to $17.26 billion. The company’s recent push to renovate stores paid off in the latest reported quarter, with traffic rising in the mid-single digit range. Morgan Stanley analysts said the company was able to pull off positive sales both at its stores and online. A push by retailers to better compete online has sometimes cannibalized their brick-and-mortar sales. “We are particularly impressed with Lululemon’s store performance given many retailers still cite negative traffic trend,” Cowen & Co analyst Oliver Chen said. The Vancouver-based company raised its full-year profit forecast to be between $3.10 and $3.18 per share, up from its previous forecast of $3 to $3.08.     Direct-to-consumer revenue, which includes online sales,  rose 62 percent in the first quarter, helping the company record a profit of 55 cents per share. Analysts were expecting a profit of 46 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At least 14 brokerages raised their price target on Lululemon’s stock, with Barclays being the most bullish. The brokerage raised its price target by $50 to $150, saying they were “hard-pressed to find anything negative” in first-quarter numbers. Morningstar analysts said strong performance at Lululemon’s men’s and accessories lines, showed its products continue to “resonate” with evolving consumer tastes. In targeting men, Lululemon has jumped into an arena dominated by the likes of Nike Inc (NKE.N) and Under Armour Inc (UAA.N) and expects the division to reach a billion dollars in sales by 2020. Lululemon was on track for $4 billion in revenue in 2020, COO Stuart Heselden said on a conference call on Thursday. The company had announced the abrupt departure of CEO Laurent Potdevin in February on undisclosed charges of misconduct.

2018-06-01,"LONDON, June 1 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The world must limit global warming to 1.5 degrees to give vulnerable populations even a 50 percent chance of surviving the impact of climate change, the former United Nations climate chief said on Friday. The 2015 Paris Agreement set a goal of limiting a rise in average world surface temperatures to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, while “pursuing efforts” for 1.5C (2.7F). But a key architect of that agreement, Christiana Figueres, told a London conference a failure to cap warming at 1.5C would be disastrous. “The reason why 1.5 degrees as a maximum temperature rise is absolutely crucial is because it is the only temperature that gives a 50 percent chance for the most vulnerable populations to survive the effects of climate change,” she said. “From where we stand today, I hear everyone think that’s impossible. Well, you know what? We’re just going to have to make it possible.” Figueres said a 2-degree rise would leave most of the low-lying Pacific islands, parts of Bangladesh, and all of New York city under water. A 1.5-degree change would give vulnerable populations a chance of surviving climate shocks like flooding, cyclones, droughts and rising sea levels, she said. “What do we do about 95 percent of the Pacific Islands going under water? That means those people have no home - talk about forced migration,” she said at the conference on women and climate change hosted by Invisible Dust, an arts and science organisation. Worldwide, seas have risen 26 cm (10 inches) since the late 19th century, driven by melting ice and the expansion of water warmed by climate change, U.N. data shows, and scientists predict a rise of another metre or more by 2100. A 2-degree temperature hike would lead to more frequent weather-related disasters and displace large numbers of people, according to the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a coalition of the countries most affected by climate change. Pacific island nations are most at risk from rising sea levels, with low-lying islands facing an existential threat as most - or all - of their land could disappear. Last year, 18.8 million people around the world were forced from their homes by storms, floods, wildfires or other natural disasters, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. Given the devastating effects of climate change, Figueres said she was disappointed when U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to pull the United States out of the Paris deal a year ago. Trump’s announcement that he was ditching the deal agreed upon by nearly 200 countries came over opposition by U.S. businesses. “To derive a conclusion that is completely contradictory to the path of history and to the interest of the US economy is actually quite sad,” Figueres said. The withdrawal would leave the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage as global competitors shifted away from polluting fossil fuels, she added. In December, countries will meet in Poland to set rules for the Paris accord's implementation, including how to monitor emissions. (Reporting by Lin Taylor @linnytayls, Editing by Claire Cozens.

2018-06-01,"LONDON (Reuters) - May was a manic month for markets but brace yourself for June.      The fate of a historic summit between North Korea and the United States is unclear but there are other events on the radar to potentially convulse world markets — from Turkish elections to a Swiss referendum on so-called sovereign money. Here are six events, listed chronologically, that investors will be watching in June:  POSSIBLE SWISS SHOCK - JUNE 10 Switzerland holds a referendum on June 10 on whether to introduce a sovereign money system that would shake up how its banks operate. The measure, if passed, would bar commercial banks from creating money every time they make a loan. Graphic: Another Swissie shock in store? - reut.rs/2L8fpu2 Supporters want the Swiss National Bank to be the only authority producing new money in the country. But the SNB argues the plan will damage its ability to conduct monetary policy. If the referendum passes, investors could lose faith in the Swiss franc CHF=EBS since money-printing will not be backed by assets. It could also hurt the profits of Swiss banks such as UBS (UBSG.S) and Credit Suisse (CSGN.S).  Opinion polls show just 35 percent support for the change,  but as Brexit and the 2016 U.S. election showed, electoral upsets can happen.  FED UP - JUNE 12-13  On June 12-13, the U.S. Federal Reserve should deliver what will be the second of three interest rate hikes expected for this year. Rates should rise to 1.75-2.0 percent. Graphic: Fed's second 2018 hike? - reut.rs/2L9Q4Qo The question now is whether the Fed might squeeze in a fourth rate rise in 2018. That likelihood lifted the dollar in May to its best month since November 2016. U.S. interest rates and Treasury yields are the main reference rate for global borrowing costs so Fed chair Jerome Powell’s post-meeting statement will be closely watched to gauge the central bank’s intentions. The U.S. economy is enjoying its second-longest expansion since World War Two, with unemployment at a 17-year low. On the other hand, trade tensions with China pose risks to growth. A hawkish note from Powell could well fuel a fresh surge in the dollar and U.S. yields.  TRUMP AND KIM - TO MEET OR NOT TO MEET The fate of a historic U.S.-North Korea summit scheduled for June 12 is unclear. But U.S. President Donald Trump said this week he hopes the meeting - and a push for Pyongyang’s de-nuclearisation — will happen. North Korea re-engagement timeline: tmsnrt.rs/2KSGocU Hopes the talks would avert the North Korean nuclear threat had lifted world equities. A North Korean delegation will visit the White House on June 1 to give Trump a letter from their leader Kim Jong-un.  With Brent crude recently soaring to $80 per barrel, a June 22 oil producers’ meeting in Vienna will be monitored by global policymakers and market players. Since early 2017, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and some other non-OPEC producers have curbed oil output. The pact runs until the end of 2018 and the Vienna meeting will discuss whether to extend it. Graphic: Oil on the boil - reut.rs/2JkIyVD But oil’s 30 percent rise since end-2016 has fanned inflation fears — the U.S. 10-year bond yield recently surged to seven-year highs.   Oil has slipped somewhat after Russia and de facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia discussed partly restoring output halted under the 2017 accord. But some other producers oppose raising production, so consensus could be hard to achieve.  Analysts reckon Brent will remain comfortably above $70 a barrel this year. Turkey, once counted among the most promising emerging markets, has suffered a massive currency and bond sell-off this year. It holds an election on June 24, with Tayyip Erdogan expected to be re-elected to a newly empowered executive presidency.  Erdogan has overseen strong economic growth in his 15 years in power but his plans to take greater control of the economy and monetary policy and a deepening crackdown on opponents criticised by rights groups and Western allies have unnerved many investors.  Graphic: Turkey interest rates - reut.rs/2Jm3Emz Polls show support for Erdogan’s AK Party and its nationalist partner at only around 50 percent, however, so a loss of parliamentary control may offset some of his sweeping powers. Turkey is struggling to stabilise the lira which has plunged as much as 20 percent this year versus the dollar TRY=. A recent 3 percentage point emergency increase in interest rates was almost immediately undermined by Erdogan, a self-confessed ""enemy of interest rates"". The central bank meets formally on June 7 and could take further steps to stabilise the currency   With time running out for Britain to secure a deal before exiting the European Union next March, diplomats are hoping an EU summit on June 28-29 could break the deadlock. Graphic: British pound: between a rock and a hard place - reut.rs/2JlvcbN British Prime Minister Theresa May remains stuck between a rock and a hard place, with Brexit supporters pushing to sever EU ties and others advocating keeping customs cooperation with the bloc. A government white paper due before the talks will outline plans for various sectors, including financial services and agriculture. Uncertainty over Britain's future EU ties continue to weigh on the economy and the pound, which is on course for a sixth weekly loss out of the last seven GBP=. The EU says London is yet to come up with a viable solution for the Irish border — the fear is that reinstating a physical border, including for customs, between EU-member Ireland and Britain’s Northern Ireland province could revive violence there.

2018-06-01,"* Pope wrote encyclical on protecting environment * Catholic leader sought end to “throwaway” culture * Oil industry under pressure to help cut emissions By Philip Pullella VATICAN CITY, June 1 (Reuters) - The Vatican will host executives of the world’s top oil companies for a conference next week on climate change and the transition away from fossil fuels, a Vatican source said on Friday. Pope Francis, who wrote a major document on protection of the environment from global warming in 2015, is expected to address the group on the last day of the June 8-9 conference. The conference, organised by Notre Dame University in the United States, is expected to be attended by the heads or senior executives of companies including ExxonMobil, Eni , BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Pemex, the source said. The oil and gas industry has come under increasing pressure from investors and activists to play a bigger role in reducing the emissions of greenhouse gasses in order to meet goals set out in a 2015 climate agreement signed in Paris. Companies are betting on increased demand for gas, the least polluting fossil fuel and to a lesser extent on renewable power such as wind and solar to meet global targets of net zero emissions by the end of the century. The conference, titled “Energy Transition and Care for Our Common Home”, will be held in the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, a 16th century villa in the Vatican gardens known as the Casina Pio IV. In the 2015 encyclical, called “Laudato Si (Praise Be), On the Care of Our Common Home”, Francis, the first pope from a developing nation, advocated a change of lifestyle in rich countries steeped in a “throwaway” consumer culture and an end to an “obstructionist attitudes” that sometimes put profit before the common good. In several passages in the six-chapter encyclical, Francis confronted head on both climate change doubters and those who say it is not man-made. He said there was a “very solid scientific consensus” that the planet was warming and that people had to “combat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it” because greenhouse gases were “released mainly as a result of human activity.” Francis called for policies to drastically reduce polluting gases, saying technology based on fossil fuels “needs to be progressively replaced without delay” and sources of renewable energy developed. One of the key architects of the pope’s encyclical, Cardinal Peter Turkson, head of the Vatican’s department on promoting human development and a firm backer of the need to stem global warming, will address the group, the source said. Last year Francis, who strongly supported the Paris agreement on climate change, implicitly criticized the United States for pulling out of the accord. The chancellor of the academy where the conference will be held, Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, called the U.S. withdrawal a “huge slap in the face” for the Vatican.

2018-06-01,"DAKAR (Reuters) - Clashes between insurgents fighting for a breakaway republic in Cameroon’s English-speaking region and security forces have killed scores of people and displaced tens of thousands more since the conflict intensified late last year. In the bloodiest incident to date, Cameroonian forces surrounded and killed more than two dozen suspected separatists in the town of Menka, in Cameroon’s Northwest Region, last weekend. Insurgents have abducted and killed soldiers and policemen in hit-and-run guerrilla raids.  (GRAPHIC: Cameroon's separatist region - tmsnrt.rs/2yVlmVV) Cameroonian forces have responded with scorched earth tactics such as burning down villages then opening fire on fleeing residents, witnesses told Reuters in February. The army denies such accusations. The unrest threatens the stability of one of Africa’s larger economies ahead of October elections widely expected to extend 85-year-old President Paul Biya’s three and a half decades in power. It has hurt cocoa output and risks spilling into Nigeria. At the end of World War One, the League of Nations carved up Germany’s imperial possessions in Africa between allied victors, mostly Britain and France. Most of the German colony of Kamerun - a swathe of central Africa housing peoples speaking 250 languages - went to France. A small part went to Britain. At independence in 1960, English speakers were given the choice of remaining part of Cameroon or joining bigger neighbour Nigeria, a former British territory. They voted to stay with Cameroon, but have since felt increasingly marginalized by the French-speaking government in Yaounde hundreds of miles away. They say the best government jobs go to French speakers, and that education, roads and health in their western region are neglected, despite Cameroon having produced tens of thousands of barrels of oil a day since the 1970s, mostly in the south-west, an English-speaking region. Initially most Anglophones in Cameroon wanted their grievances addressed. A minority wanted an independent state, which they call “Ambazonia”. However, since late 2016 a heavy-handed response to protests — including the jailing of some English-speaking activists and sympathisers — has convinced many that only severance from Cameroon will satisfy their yearning for a better life. The Ambazonians have printed passports, designed a currency and a flag, composed a national anthem and set up a satellite TV station. Many of their most influential figures are in exile in Europe and the United States, however. They also have a vocal presence on social media, reflecting the Anglophone region’s reputation as an unlikely but successful tech hub, dubbed “Silicon Mountain”. In October 2016 lawyers and teachers in English-speaking cities went on strike in protest at having to use French in schools and courtrooms. In the ensuing clashes, six protesters were killed and hundreds arrested, some of whom were put on trial for charges carrying long sentences or the death penalty. Authorities cut Internet access for three months. Support for secession grew, and on Oct. 1, 2017 — the anniversary of the region’s independence from Britain — thousands took to the streets to demand a breakaway state. The military stepped in. Witnesses said troops opened fire from attack helicopters; the military denied this. Thousands of Anglophones fled the ensuing crackdown, which Cameroon authorities said was necessary to restore peace and curb banditry. They described it as an anti-terrorist operation. A month later, separatists launched the first guerrilla attacks on security forces, killing four over a few days. Cameroon’s 180,000 barrels per day of oil output is mostly offshore and its main economic hubs — the port of Douala and the capital Yaounde — have been unaffected.  But cocoa fields in the world’s fourth biggest producer have been left fallow and Cameroon’s nascent tech sector has withered. Most of the displaced are in Cameroon but more than 20,000 refugees have fled to Nigeria, which Cameroonian authorities have long feared could become a rear base for a guerrilla campaign.  In theory, a destabilised west Cameroon might suit Nigeria. Abuja accepted a 2002 International Court of Justice ruling that the disputed and oil-rich Bakassi peninsula, part of the Anglophone south-west, belonged to Cameroon, despite having come close to war over it several times. But Nigeria periodically grumbles about it. So far, Nigeria has cooperated, deporting separatists including Julius Ayuk Tabe, a key leader. Diplomats say it needs Cameroon’s help in fighting Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which plagues the neighbours’ common border up north. Britain and France have kept their distance, conscious of post-colonial rivalry pitting them against each other in African civil conflicts - as in Rwanda in the early 1990s when English-speaking Tutsi rebels battled Francophone Hutus. France has condemned separatist violence and urged dialogue. Britain has “encouraged the parties to reject violence.” Biya, who has ruled virtually by decree since replacing a retired predecessor in 1982, is almost certain to win an October election. In 2011, he won by 78 percent.  His leadership style coupled with long absences overseas — usually to Switzerland with his wife — makes a goodwill gesture to smooth things over unlikely. The poll will be difficult to organise in the hostile Anglophone region. Anywhere where voting fails to happen could ignite in fresh bouts of unrest. There is also an outside chance that the low-level insurgency could escalate into a broader civil conflict, if enough people join the rebellion and if they get enough arms. Nigeria’s next door delta region is awash with cheap weapons and criminal gangs who would be willing to sell, although cooperation by its authorities has denied the rebels a convenient base.

2018-06-01,"GOMA, Congo (Reuters) - The population of mountain gorillas, one of the world’s most endangered species, which survives on the forest-cloaked volcanoes of central Africa, has increased by a quarter to over 1,000 individuals since 2010, wildlife authorities said. That is despite the threat posed by poachers and armed groups in the Virunga Massif, a spine of volcanic mountains in the western Rift Valley straddling eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda and Rwanda, where most of them reside. The latest census put them at 1,004 individuals: 604 in Virunga, and 400 in Uganda’s nearby Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Joel Wenga Malembe, spokesman for the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature, told Reuters. The last survey, in 2010, found just 786 of this critically endangered eastern gorilla sub-species, of which 480 were in Virunga. “These numbers are truly remarkable, far exceeding our expectations, and are the result of a collaborative, three-country effort with governments and partners all playing an important role,” Mike Cranfield, of charity Gorilla Doctors, said in a statement. Partly because they are so rare, the mountain gorillas are a major source of tourist revenue for the three nations, and their habitat supports other rare species found nowhere else such as golden monkeys. But they are under constant threat of encroachment by farmers in one of Africa’s most densely populated rural regions, and hunting for bush meat or bizarre trophies sold abroad. Congo has also invited oil companies to start drilling in Virunga, Africa’s largest tropical rainforest reserve, which conservationists worry will put the environment in greater danger. Adding to Virunga’s woes, rangers banned tourists this month from entering the park during investigations into the kidnapping of two Britons by an armed militia.

2018-06-01,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * MSCI All Country World Index up 0.3 percent * Italian stocks, bonds rebound on coalition deal * New Spanish PM takes over, Spanish bond yields sink * Trade war fears resurface after fresh U.S. tariffs By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, June 1 (Reuters) - World stocks rose and bond yields fell on Friday as investors welcomed the apparent end to a political crisis in Italy and shrugged off a change in Spain’s leadership, although prospects of a full-blown trade war curbed the gains. The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, rose 0.3 percent. It was set for a third week of losses, however, brought on by the risks of a snap election in Italy. Late on Thursday, leaders of Italy’s anti-establishment parties revived coalition plans, apparently ending three months of political turmoil. The new government was being installed on Friday. Italian stocks rallied 2.6 percent, the standout performers in Europe. The political crisis knocked more than 9 percent off the Italian benchmark in May, its worst month since June 2016. The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 1.1 percent. Borrowing costs in Italy also fell. Italian two-year yields, which soared to five-year highs above 2.7 percent on Tuesday, retreated to Monday’s levels. Investors seemed to ignore a change in leadership in Spain, where Pedro Sanchez replaced Mariano Rajoy as prime minister after Rajoy lost a no-confidence vote in parliament on Friday . Sanchez and most Spanish parties are pro-European, so investors see less political risk there than in Italy. Spain’s 10-year government bond yield dropped 13 basis points to a two-week low of 1.36 percent. “The parties leading in the polls in Spain are centrists, so we’re not getting the proposals for fiscal extremes as we have in Italy,” said Michael Metcalfe, head of global macro strategy at State Street Global Markets Futures showed U.S. stocks were set to open higher. Traders will be keeping an eye on the monthly U.S. jobs report due at 1230 GMT. Economists polled by Reuters forecast 188,000 jobs were added in the month of May. Of potentially greater concern to investors was the renewed prospect of a global trade war after the United States imposed steel and aluminium tariffs on Canada, Mexico and the European Union. Canada and Mexico retaliated with levies on billions of dollars of U.S. goods from orange juice to pork. The European Union was set to tax bourbon whiskey and Harley Davidson motorcycles. The U.S. announcement pushed stocks lower, although a weaker yen supported Japanese stocks and firm exports boosted South Korean markets. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.1 percent but remained down roughly 0.6 percent for the week. “In the short term, the immediate economic impact (of tariffs) may well be limited as we’ve known these have been coming for some time, which may have given companies time to build up some inventory,” wrote Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in a note to clients. “However, the decision to retaliate by the EU, Canada and Mexico on a range of other U.S. goods, could well lead to a further escalation in the days ahead.” The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.5 percent and the blue-chip CSI300 index dropped 0.75 percent. Traders said Chinese stocks were volatile as the long-awaited inclusion of large-cap shares from the country in MSCI’s emerging markets index had failed to buoy the market or attract immediate flows of foreign money. On Friday, about 230 yuan-denominated mainland A-shares were included in MSCI index for the first time. Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimates China’s A-shares could account for some 30 percent of MSCI’s emerging market index once they are fully included. In currencies, the Canadian dollar was flat and the Mexican peso was down by 0.3 percent. Both currencies fell on Thursday after the U.S. decision to impose tariffs. The euro was set to snap a six-week losing streak, supported by falling bond yields. The dollar index, which measures it against a basket of currencies was up 0.1 percent. The dollar also posted its biggest daily rise in two weeks against the yen. Brent crude rose 0.1 percent to $77.68 a barrel. U.S. crude fell 0.7 percent to $66.55 a barrel. The spread between Brent crude oil futures contracts and U.S. WTI stood at its widest for three years.

2018-06-01,"June 1 (Reuters) - Lululemon Athletica Inc’s shares were set to open at a record high on Friday as customers continued to flock to the athletic apparel maker’s stores in spite of intense online competition. Shares of the Canadian company, which popularized “athleisure wear” by turning pricey women’s yoga wear into mainstream fashion, were up 7.75 percent at $113.19 in premarket trading. Lululemon’s recent push to renovate stores paid off in the latest reported quarter, with traffic rising in the mid-single digit range. “We are particularly impressed with Lululemon’s store performance given many retailers still cite negative traffic trend,” Cowen & Co analyst Oliver Chen said. Direct-to-consumer revenue, which includes online sales, rose 62 percent in the first quarter, helping the company record a profit of 55 cents per share. Analysts were expecting a profit of 46 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At least nine brokerages raised their price target on Lululemon’s stock, with Barclays being the most bullish. The brokerage raised its price target by $50 to $150, saying they were “hard-pressed to find anything negative” in first-quarter numbers. Morningstar analysts said strong performance at Lululemon’s men’s and accessories lines, showed its products continue to “resonate” with evolving consumer tastes. In targeting men, Lululemon has jumped into an arena dominated by the likes of Nike Inc and Under Armour Inc and expects the division to reach a billion dollars in sales by 2020. Lululemon was on track for $4 billion in revenue in 2020, COO Stuart Heselden said on a conference call on Thursday. The company had announced the abrupt departure of CEO Laurent Potdevin in February on undisclosed charges of misconduct.

2018-06-01,"LONDON (Reuters) - Russian energy major Rosneft (ROSN.MM) is increasingly  challenging domestic rival Gazprom (GAZP.MM) in international gas markets, from West Africa to Turkey and even Europe, according to five industry sources with knowledge of the matter. Last week, Rosneft won a multi-billion dollar contract in Ghana that had been targeted by Gazprom, the sources said. It also signed a gas fields and pipeline deal in Iraqi Kurdistan aimed at supplying gas to Turkey and Europe - Gazprom’s core markets. Oil-focused Rosneft’s international expansion in gas will put the two Russian state-owned giants in direct competition, particularly in the lucrative European market, which is worth over $150 billion a year. Rosneft has also hired a handful of ex-Gazprom employees in recent months who advised on the Ghana deal and has poached one of Gazprom’s senior European risk officers, according to the sources and information on LinkedIn.  Rosneft and Gazprom declined to comment. While Rosneft could potentially take some gas market share from Gazprom, it is unlikely to be able to make a major dent in its rival’s dominance. Gazprom, which has monopoly rights on gas pipeline exports from Russia, is the world’s biggest gas producer and the main supplier to Europe, where it shares has steadily grown to reach nearly 40 percent last year. The Rosneft drive, aimed at boosting earnings as the world moves towards cleaner fuels such as gas, points to an attempt by Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin, a powerful ally of President Vladimir Putin, to further expand his influence.  Sechin has repeatedly lobbied the Kremlin to curb Gazprom’s export rights, including in a letter to Putin in 2016. “Rosneft has been long trying to persuade the Kremlin to dismantle Gazprom’s monopoly. Having failed to do it from within Russia, they are now trying to do this externally,” said one of the sources, who works with Rosneft on gas projects.  Rosneft announced the Ghana deal last Friday, a contract worth almost $10 billion at today’s prices to ship 1.7 million tonnes of LNG to the country over 12 years. However three sources said the project was initially supposed to go to Gazprom, which signed a preliminary deal with the Ghanaian government last September. The agreement fell apart because Gazprom was slow to finalize it due to a restructuring of its export division abroad, added the sources, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.  “Due to a corporate restructuring, Gazprom’s supply obligations under the agreement have been assumed by Rosneft,” said Ghana’s National Petroleum Corporation, which signed the deal. The Kurdistan project had also been offered to Gazprom - although much earlier, at the end of last decade - but it was never finalised, allowing Rosneft to expand its dominance in the semi-autonomous region beyond oil, according to two sources close to the contract. The deal, to develop gas reserves in the semi-autonomous region and build an export pipeline, was also announced last Friday but neither Rosneft nor the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) have disclosed potential export volumes or destinations.  The two sources said Rosneft would build a pipeline which would have a capacity of up to 30 billion cubic meters (bcm) a year when it begins operation early in the next decade. The pipeline could supply up to 10 bcm of gas to Turkey and up to 10 bcm to Europe, putting Gazprom’s Russian gas in competition with Iraqi resources, said the sources. A spokesman for the KRG’s national resources ministry said the government did not comment on the corporate activities of international energy companies in the region. Rosneft could also supply Europe with new volumes from the giant Zohr gas field in Egypt, where it is a partner in a joint venture with Eni and BP. The projects’ partners have said gas would initially go to Egypt but could be also liquefied for exports at a later stage.  Oil-focused Rosneft is Russia’s most valuable energy company with a market capitalization of $65 billion, but its gas operations are relatively small - with an annual output of 68 bcm - though it is expanding them rapidly.  It is dwarfed in gas by Gazprom, which has an annual output of 471 bcm. Gazprom supplies 200 bcm of gas a year to Europe and Turkey, and volumes have grown steadily in recent years.  The gas giant, worth $54 billion, is the biggest supplier to Turkey with volumes of over 25 bcm a year, representing more than 60 percent of the country’s gas demand.  Gazprom’s biggest rivals in Europe are Algeria’s Sonatrach and Norway’s Statoil while globally it faces competition from liquefied gas from Qatar Petroleum and the United States.  One of Rosneft’s recent hires was Gazprom’s head of risk in Germany, Dzhamil Bulgakov, according to two sources and Bulgakov’s LinkedIn profile. He has been working for Rosneft’s gas export offices in Germany since last year.  Bulgakov could not be reached for comment. Gazprom is currently restructuring its export division and plans to cut hundreds of jobs at its overseas trading and export offices, including Britain, and move them to St Petersburg, sources told Reuters in March. Some former employees from Gazprom’s trading offices have been working as advisers to Rosneft on the Ghana deal in recent months, according to two industry sources. It was not clear if the staff had been poached from Gazprom, or had already left in the restructuring.

2018-06-01,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Commodities traders have been waiting more than a week for China to release overdue monthly import-export data, frustrating many market watchers and fuelling speculation about reasons for the delay.  The prolonged wait for final April commodities trade statistics from the world’s top buyer of oil, metals and grains comes as negotiators from Washington gather in Beijing for a round of talks aimed at avoiding an all-out trade war. The April data, initially due on May 23, will show the scale of market disruptions since Washington and Beijing embarked on escalating tit-for-tat tariff threats, roiling flows of commodities such as soybeans, sorghum and corn. Traders were hoping to glean from the final April data signs that China had stopped buying American agricultural goods, or started to switch to buying more from other countries, such as Brazil, Russia and Australia. The company which collates and sells the data, China Cuslink Co Ltd, which is operated by customs, was ordered to delay publication indefinitely due to technical reasons, three officials at the company told Reuters.  One said the instructions came from customs, while another said it was from another government agency. The officials, who declined to be identified, gave no further details. A spokesman for General Administration of Customs confirmed the suspension, but gave no reason. While the timing of the delay may be coincidence, some traders speculated Beijing may want to conceal statistics that could somehow undermine its negotiating stance. But Michael Mao, senior energy analyst in Shandong province at China Sublime Information Group, doubted there was a link.  “If Beijing wants to adjust the April data to sweeten trade talks, it won’t work for obvious reasons,” Mao said. “If the official data and shipping data don’t match, analysts are smart enough to tell that authorities massaged official data.” Companies like Thomson Reuters and other media companies and consultancies pay to receive the final statistics, which give a breakdown by import origin and export destination for everything from sorghum to natural gas and steel.  Mao said speculation had circulated in the market that Beijing was considering stopping the sale of the data to some companies. Reuters was not able to verify this. Traders and analysts seeking to use the data to devise trading strategies expressed frustration at the delay and lack of information. “It is such nonsense to delay the data for political reasons,” said one veteran Beijing-based oil trader, who declined to be identified as he is not authorised to speak to the media. It’s not unusual for statistical releases to be postponed by a day or two, and many analysts and trade experts have anyway long questioned the accuracy of official Chinese economic data. The delay also comes as China’s customs department undergoes a major overhaul, taking on extra functions, including import safety, which was previously handled by a separate agency, as part of a broader effort to make policymaking more efficient. Still, an indefinite delay without a clear explanation is extremely rare, experts say. Preliminary numbers showing total imports and exports earlier in the month revealed upheaval in flows of grains, such as sorghum, which were temporarily hit with anti-dumping sanctions by China. The wait for the data comes as U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross heads to Beijing for talks aimed at narrowing China’s $375 billion (282 billion pounds) trade surplus, an effort Washington hopes results in China significantly ramping up purchases of American farm products and energy. Ross is due in Beijing on June 2 to 4. On Wednesday, a delegation of more than 50 U.S. officials arrived in the Chinese capital for talks, according to China’s commerce ministry. Michael Lion, a China metals industry veteran who is president of Lion Consulting Asia in Hong Kong, said the delay may be a strategic decision while trade talks continue. “It would be consistent from my experience for (the Chinese authorities) to withhold information that they might believe could be used by counterparties in negotiations,” Lion told Reuters by email. Some market participants are resigned to a long wait, as the veteran oil trader noted: “Customs will probably delay the data until China solves the trade dispute with the U.S.”  Reporting by Chen Aizhu, Tom Daly, Meng Meng, Hallie Gu and Dominique Patton; Writing by Josephine Mason; Editing by Tony Munroe and David Holmes",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-china-data/wheres-the-data-angst-for-commods-traders-as-china-trade-figures-held-in-limbo-idUKL2N1T208W,01 Jun 2018,"Commodities traders have been

2018-06-01,"PARIS (Reuters) - Total (TOTF.PA) is determined to push ahead with its plans to drill for oil in the Amazon basin, it said on Friday as Greenpeace activists interrupted its annual general meeting in protest at the project. The French oil major wants to explore Brazil’s Foz do Amazonas basin, but Brazil’s environmental agency rejected its licence application on Tuesday for a fourth time. As the company’s annual general meeting opened in Paris on Friday, four activists from Greenpeace descended by rope from the ceiling above the stage, unfurling banners reading “Let’s save the Amazon’s coral reef”. At least a dozen others managed to enter the hall, with some chaining themselves to fixtures in the room. Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne told the meeting he would not cede to any kind of blackmail over the project, as the activists dangled on ropes above him.  “Our position on the Amazon project has not been abandoned. We have our rights and we have obviously to respect Brazilian laws,” Pouyanne told shareholders. “It is also clear that Brazil’s environmental regulators are under immense pressure from other organisations. We are exchanging information with them.” Brazil’s Foz do Amazonas basin could contain up to 14 billion barrels of oil, geologists estimate, or more than the entire proven reserves in the Gulf of Mexico. A Greenpeace expedition in April documented coral in the area where Total plans to drill, after an earlier discovery of a massive coral reef nearby. “Total refuses to listen to reason and persists in wanting to drill near this unique reef, at the risk of destroying it,” Francois Chartier, head of Greenpeace’s Oceans campaign, said in a statement. Brazil’s environmental agency requested more information from the company when it rejected its bid for an environmental licence on Tuesday. The Greenpeace activists were also protesting at Total’s investment in offshore oil production blocks in French Guyana, which will boost its presence in the potentially lucrative Guyana basin. Total faces more protests this month, after France’s largest farmers’ union called for a blockade of French oil refineries in protest at the company’s decision to use imported palm oil at a new biofuel production site.

2018-06-01," (This version of the May 31 story refiles with full task force name.) By Nina Chestney LONDON (Reuters) - The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has published guidance for companies reporting on the physical impact of climate change in their financial results. Concerns in the financial community that assets are being mispriced because climate risk is not being factored into financial reporting has prompted demand for more meaningful and transparent climate-related financial information. A global task force set up by the G20, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), has developed a voluntary framework for companies to disclose the financial impact of climate-related risks and opportunities. Around two thirds of G20 member states have engaged with the framework since its launch last year, a study by the UK-based Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership shows.  However, the TCFD framework does not provide much concrete detail on the metrics for reporting climate risks and opportunities in financial disclosures. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Netherlands-based Global Centre for Excellence on Climate Adaptation (GCECA) therefore conducted an analysis with working groups in the financial and corporate sectors to identify a standard set of metrics. The working groups included representatives from organisations and firms such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Allianz, the Bank of England, Barclays, Maersk, Lloyds, Shell, BlackRock and Zurich Asset Management. They came up with 18 recommendations for firms when disclosing climate impacts, which include projecting physical climate effects, such as droughts, heat stress and extreme rainfall, on their assets or financial instruments’ lifetime, over a five to 20-year time frame. Risks beyond 20 years should also be assessed using scenarios to account for uncertainty in climate policy and impacts of climate change, the guidance said. Another recommendation is for firms to assess the potential changes in their value chains as a result of physical climate impacts and potential market shifts as customer needs change. Companies should also describe their processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate risks, such as risk management processes, insurance coverage, planned facility moves or retrofits, and corporate climate resilience strategy. Last week, a survey by a UK committee of lawmakers showed that seven out of Britain’s 25 largest pension funds have committed to report on climate risks in line with the TCFD framework. Eight are considering to do so, while 10 have no plans to do so.

2018-06-01,"* Russia plans to produce up to 120 mln T LNG per year by 2035 * To compete with Australia, U.S. on global LNG market By Oksana Kobzeva and Olesya Astakhova ST PETERSBURG, June 1 (Reuters) - Russia plans to raise its annual production of seaborne liquefied natural gas (LNG) to as much as 120 million tonnes by 2035 and take market share from Australia and the United States by capitalising on low costs, a deputy energy minister said. In December, Russia’s No.2 gas producer Novatek and its partners including France’s Total launched the Yamal LNG plant in the Arctic, with capacity of 17.4 million tonnes per year seen reachable by the end of 2019. The project highlights Russia’s ability to produce LNG in harsh climates and further strengthens its foothold in the global energy market. “Russia may set a goal of producing 100-120 million tonnes (of LNG) per year by 2035,” Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Sorokin said in an interview. “We understand this from our discussions with the companies about their potential, which they can add to their previously announced projects.” Yamal LNG aims to help Russia double the country’s share of the global LNG market by 2020 from about 4 percent now. Qatar, aided by production costs that are among the world’s lowest, is the biggest LNG exporter with a 30 percent market share. Novatek also plans to launch LNG production at the neighbouring Gydan peninsula. Russia’s Gazprom, jointly with partners including Shell, launched the country’s first LNG plant in 2009 on the Pacific island of Sakhalin with a capacity of more than 10 million tonnes per year. Yamal LNG has produced around 2 million tonnes since its launch in December. So far, Russia has been the dominant player in pipeline gas supplies to Europe, with Gazprom supplying around a third of the continent’s needs. Demand for seaborne LNG has taken off in recent years as it is cleaner than oil or coal, and can reach markets worldwide because it does not depend on pipeline networks. LNG is typically more expensive than pipeline gas, however. Sorokin said he expects global LNG demand almost to double in the next 20 years to exceed 500 million tonnes per year. U.S. export capacity has shot up from less than 2 million tonnes per year in 2015 to 18 million tonnes in 2017, and is projected to top 77 million by 2022. That would see the United States leapfrog Australia to become the world’s No. 2 exporter. “What will trigger the rivalry are the additional volumes that the U.S. or Australia could supply,” Sorokin said, adding that Russian companies are highly competitive due to their low costs for production and transportation. According to the Moscow-based Skolkovo think tank, average production and transportation costs at Yamal LNG for exports to Shanghai are seen at just above $8 per million British thermal units (mBtu) by 2025. That is roughly the same as the cost for LNG projects in Western Australia and less than the approximately $9 for LNG exports from the southeastern United States. The same figure for Sakhalin-2 stands at below $4, the lowest among current global projects.

2018-06-01,"* Plan to transfer scattered gas storage assets to E&P unit * Suppliers urged to own storage able to cover 10 pct of sales * Consolidation does not cover LNG storage facilities By Chen Aizhu BEIJING, June 1 (Reuters) - China’s CNPC plans to consolidate billion-dollar underground gas storage assets into one business to expedite an infrastructure upgrade it needs to avert a long-term supply crunch during peak winter heating season, company officials told Reuters. Underground facilities scattered across different businesses, like natural gas marketing and pipeline units, are expected to be transferred to CNPC’s exploration and production (E&P) department, senior company officials briefed on the plan said. CNPC is the parent of top Asian oil and gas producer PetroChina. China, the world’s third-largest gas consumer, is facing a shortage of underground storage amid Beijing’s drive to boost use of natural gas in order to cut pollution from coal. Currently its underground storages can only meet 5 percent of total gas used versus 20 percent in the United States, leaving China vulnerable to the kind of supply crunch it suffered early this year. Freezing weather and a sweeping government campaign to switch millions of homes and businesses from coal to gas led to supply cuts at some industrial users as authorities prioritised households. CNPC produces some 70 percent of China’s domestic gas, and owns and operates most of the country’s underground gas storage units (UGS). A CNPC spokesman did not respond to request for comment. “The purpose of letting E&P take care of UGS business is to speed up building the storage, as the upstream division has the technical know-how and also operates the gas fields that are main sites to build the storage (units),” said one company official. A second official said the plan could be announced as soon as in the coming weeks. The officials declined to be identified because the plan was not yet public. China now operates 25 facilities with total designed working capacity of 18.9 billion cubic metres (bcm) and working volume of 11.7 bcm. PetroChina built 23 of them, with the remaining two build by Sinopec. Led by CNPC, China has embarked on a building boom of UGS over the next five-eight years, spending more than $10 billion to nearly double gas storages. Most will be built from tapped or producing wells. Some storage facilities, such as in the gas-rich southwest Sichuan basin, are already run by the E&P division, said a third CNPC official based in Chongqing, China’s shale gas hub. Beijing has urged China’s gas suppliers - mainly CNPC, Sinopec and CNOOC - to have storage facilities able to meet at least 10 percent of their contracted sales by 2020. The government is also expected to roll out market-based pricing to stimulate investment. The officials briefed on the plan said the assets to be transferred will not include storages at CNPC’s receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas. These will continue to be operated by a separate unit, PetroChina Kunlun Energy.

2018-06-01,"* AGL in discussion with short-listed LNG suppliers * LNG imports could start by 2020-2021 By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, June 1 (Reuters) - AGL Energy Ltd, Australia’s biggest power producer, expects to make a final investment decision on the country’s first liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal in the financial year of 2019, a company official said on Friday. The A$250 million ($189 million) project will consist of a leased floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) and jetty at Crib Point in the southeastern state of Victoria. The terminal will handle up to 130 to 140 petajoules a year, or 2.6 million tonnes of LNG, by 2020 or 2021. “We are working to progress the project to a final investment decision in the financial year 2019 and are on track to do that,” said Phaedra Deckart, general manager of AGL’s energy supply and origination team. “We are in discussion with short-listed LNG suppliers and FSRU providers on the other components to the project.” AGL’s financial year runs from July to June. Australia is set to become the world’s top exporter of LNG, but that is paradoxically creating a shortage at home as gas is pulled away from local markets in the southeast. AGL is looking to fill a looming gas supply shortfall in southeast Australia and break the grip of the market’s major gas suppliers, led by ExxonMobil Corp and BHP Billiton . The company needs gas for its retail customers as well as its own power plants. It depends heavily on supply from the Gippsland Basin joint venture, owned by Exxon and BHP, and from Royal Dutch Shell, which has been selling gas from Queensland. LNG imports into Australia could provide competition to the gas market in southern Australia and in turn cap prices, Deckart said. “Australian consumers are paying at times more and higher prices than the LNG netback prices, so we see the LNG imports effectively putting a cap,” she said at a conference organised by S&P Global Platts in Singapore. “It doesn’t mean other Australian supply won’t be coming to the market in Australia, but it will mean it can’t come to the market at a price higher than LNG import pricing.” The company could also import additional cargoes if there are any unplanned outages, capacity constraint or if there is a security of supply issue, she added.

2018-06-01,"* NordLink cable to transport power to and from Germany * Cable is one of three linking Norway to rest of Europe By Lefteris Karagiannopoulos VOLLESFJORD, Norway, June 1 (Reuters) - A power cable being laid between Germany and Norway may lower Norwegian energy prices in its first years as wind power in northern Germany at times cannot be exported further south due to grid bottlenecks, Norway’s Statnett said. NordLink, a 1.4-gigawatt interconnector that will begin operations in 2020, will export power produced by hydro-electric dams from Norway to Germany. It could also import power. The project and other planned cables have been under fire in Norway over concerns the Nordic country would lose its cheap power supply by exporting electricity to Germany. Cheap power has been a draw for energy-hungry industries in Norway. Statnett spokesman Christer Gilje said the new cable could initially lower prices for Norwegian customers until Germany’s grid is upgraded to distribute the extra supplies from Nordlink, although he said prices would rise after 2025. “Power prices in Norway may sometimes be lower in the beginning,” he said on a visit to the site where a bright yellow subsea cable was being connected to Norway’s grid on land. He said this was because Germany now sometimes had surplus power from wind generation in the north, pushing down prices as the German grid could not yet transmit the extra power south. “When you have a big surplus that drives prices down to zero and sometimes actually below zero in Germany ... it will affect Norwegian prices,” he said, without saying by how much. After 2025, the 1.5 billion-2 billion euro ($1.8 billion-$2.3 billion) cable would increase Norwegian power prices by an estimated one euro per megawatt hour, he said. This week, Statnett began laying the second of two 0.7 gigawatt subsea wires that together make up the interconnector, in a fjord in the southwest of the country. “The Norwegian subsea part will be completed this year,” project director Stein Haavard Auno told Reuters. NordLink is being developed by Statnett, Dutch-German grid firm TenneT and Germany’s KfW investment bank. French cable maker Nexans is installing the cable in Norway. NordLink is due to start commercial trials by the end of 2020, with upgrades on the Norwegian grid completed by 2022, Statnett said. $1 = 0.8553 euros

2018-06-01,"(No changes, repeats story from morning of June 1) * IATA to lower industry profit estimate, CEO says * Fuel, labour, infrastructure costs rising * Safety in focus as fatalities rise in 2018 By Jamie Freed SYDNEY, June 1 (Reuters) - Airline executives are gathering in Sydney’s winter chill under the shadow of higher oil prices and a string of accidents after enjoying a near-spotless 2017 in terms of profits and safety. The annual meeting of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), with 130 CEOs and 1,000 delegates, will kick off on Sunday, and worries that a three-year run of unusually high returns might end are in the spotlight. Meeting host Qantas Airways Ltd, led by outspoken Irish-born CEO Alan Joyce, has to many embodied the industry’s turnaround. The Australian airline, nicknamed the “Flying Kangaroo,” swung from a record loss in 2014 to forecast a record profit in the financial year ending June 30 as it cut costs, boosted revenue and benefited from lower oil prices. Shares have risen six-fold since late 2013. But now, like other carriers, it is grappling with the return of $80 a barrel oil, rising airport charges and a global pilot shortage that has led it to cancel flights and invest A$20 million ($15.13 million) in a new training school. IATA, which represents about 280 airlines comprising 83 percent of global air traffic, in December predicted a record $38.4 billion of net profit for the airline industry in 2018, with $27.9 billion coming from U.S. and European airlines. That estimate, however, assumed an average oil price of $60 a barrel in 2018. An updated profit forecast to be issued on Monday will be lower, as the cost of oil, infrastructure and labour rises, IATA CEO Alexandre de Juniac told reporters in Sydney on Thursday. “We have seen a rise in the fuel cost now for almost 15 months,” he said. “Usually you see an impact on fares 10 to 12 months after, but for the moment I have to say the fuel increase has not been passed on in fares.” Major U.S. airlines, the biggest of which have not hedged fuel costs, reported a 24 percent, or $600 million, decline in pre-tax profits in the quarter that ended March 31 compared with a year earlier as rising costs crimped margins, according to data from trade group Airlines for America. Several major airline CEOs, notably in Europe, have warned that rising oil prices could put pressure on carriers in the northern hemisphere summer. That might lead to further consolidation or bankruptcies after the collapse of Air Berlin and Monarch Airlines last year. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see a few of these weaker carriers slip further into difficulties and potentially see some exits from the market in the latter part of this year,” Willie Walsh, CEO of British Airways and Iberian parent IAG, said in early May. Lower oil prices have allowed airlines to expand rapidly, with lower costs helping spur 7.6 percent growth in passenger demand last year, well above the 10-year average annual growth rate of 5.5 percent. “If they are forced to start raising prices, that traffic growth could very quickly disappear at the same time that profits disappear,” said Peter Harbison, Executive Chairman of CAPA Centre for Aviation. Trans-Atlantic flying remains uncertain because of the need to pursue post-Brexit deals. But a long-running dispute between U.S. and Gulf carriers that had led to vigorous debate over subsidies at previous IATA gatherings has finally been put to rest. That could leave more time for industry leaders to focus on improving safety after a poor start to the year following a 2017 performance so positive that U.S. President Donald Trump in January took credit for “the best and safest year on record” in a tweet. Five serious aviation accidents have killed 301 people in the first five months of 2018, according to Reuters calculations, which compares with just 19 on-board fatalities in all of 2017. $1 = 1.3215 Australian dollars

2018-06-01,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * MSCI ACWI up 0.2 percent * Italian bonds rebound on coalition deal * Italian stocks lead gains in Europe * Spotlight shifts to PM’s no-confidence vote in Spain * Trade war fears resurface after fresh U.S. tariffs By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, June 1 (Reuters) - World stocks rose and bond yields fell on Friday as investors welcomed an apparent end to a political crisis in Italy, although prospects of a full-blown trade war put a dampener on gains. The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, rose 0.2 percent. It was set for a third week of losses however, dented earlier in the week by risks of a snap election in Italy. Late on Thursday, leaders of Italy’s anti-establishment parties revived coalition plans, apparently ending three months of political turmoil. Italian stocks rallied 2.6 percent, the standout performers in Europe. The political crisis knocked more than 9 percent off the Italian benchmark in May, its worst months since June 2016. The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.7 percent. Borrowing costs in Italy also fell sharply. Italian two-year yields, which soared to five-year highs above 2.7 percent on Tuesday in a throwback to the euro debt crisis, retreated back to Monday’s levels. Events in Italy pushed peripheral euro zone bond yields down for a third straight day, as investors also kept an eye on a second southern European state, Spain, where Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy set to be forced out of office by a no-confidence vote. “We’ve had a rude awakening of European political risks this week, so the potential fall of the Spanish government would cause volatility but the situation in Spain is very different from Italy,” said Michael Metcalfe, head of global macro strategy, State Street Global Markets. “The parties leading in the polls in Spain are centrists so we’re not getting the proposals for fiscal extremes as we have in Italy.” Of potentially greater concerns to investors was the renewed prospect of a global trade war after the United States imposed steel and aluminium tariffs on Canada, Mexico and the European Union. The news pushed Wall Street lower overnight and set the initial tone in Asian stocks, though a weaker yen supported Japanese stocks and firm exports boosted South Korean markets. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.1 percent but the index was still down roughly 0.6 percent for the week, reflecting earlier concerns about Italy’s struggle to form a government that drove it to a six-week low. Equity markets are likely to feel pressure, said Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo, “as the United States has opened up a new point of contention on the trade front by getting involved with the European Union. “President (Donald) Trump has not accomplished very much in terms of trade issues and is likely to remain vocal with the U.S. mid-term elections coming up”. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.5 percent and the blue-chip CSI300 index dropped 0.75 percent. Traders said Chinese stocks were volatile as the long-awaited inclusion of large-cap shares from the country in MSCI’s emerging markets index had failed to buoy the market or attract immediate flows of foreign money. On Friday, about 230 yuan-denominated mainland A-shares were included in MSCI index for the first time. Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimates China’s A-shares could account for some 30 percent of MSCI’s emerging market index once they are fully included. In currencies, the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso were flat, recovering from Thursday’s falls after the U.S. decision to impose tariffs. The euro was flat, while the dollar climbed 0.3 percent to 109.140 yen, supported by U.S. yields reversing overnight declines. The dollar index, which measures it against a basket of currencies was up 0.1 percent. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.871 percent after brushing a 1-1/2-month low of 2.759 percent on Tuesday. Brent crude rose 0.2 percent to $77.70 a barrel. U.S. crude rose 0.2 percent to $67.19 a barrel. Brent’s premium over U.S. crude reached its widest since March 2015 this week.

Developing manufacturing for electric car battery materials is of strategic importance for the European automotive industry, as it plans to speed up the shift to zero-emissions motoring in the face of stricter European Union regulation. Most battery cells are produced in Asia and last October the EU hosted auto, chemical and engineering executives to discuss developing battery manufacturing in the bloc.. Umicore Chief Executive Marc Grynberg said the plant would “significantly contribute to the European Union’s initiative to promulgate a leading rechargeable battery industry based on innovative technologies and a sustainable supply chain.” Umicore’s factory will be based in Nysa in southern Poland and is due to start deliveries in late 2020, Umicore said. The investment will create up to 400 jobs in the first phase. Umicore’s choice of Poland follows that of South Korea’s LG Chem, which in October said it would open Europe’s largest lithium-ion battery factory in the country.

Still, rekindled concerns about U.S. trade policies limited regional gains. Spreadbetters expect European stocks to follow Asia’s firmer tone and have marked in a modest rise of 0.15 percent for Britain’s FTSE and gains of 0.5 percent for Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.1 percent but the index was still down roughly 0.6 percent for the week, during which it hit a six-week low on concerns about Italy’s struggle to form a government. A fall on Wall Street on Thursday after the United States said it would impose tariffs on aluminium and steel imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union, set the initial tone in Asia. Fears of a global trade conflict, which had partially receded in past weeks, were reignited as Washington’s allies retaliated against the U.S. measures. However, regional sentiment recovered somewhat with South Korea’s KOSPI rising 0.7 percent on upbeat export data and Japan’s Nikkei advancing 0.2 percent off the back of yen weakness against the dollar.

2018-06-01,"YAOUNDE, June 1 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Cameroon has cut thousands of hectares of forest to build stadiums, hotels, roads and housing to host the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations - a move that could lead to worsening urban flooding and droughts, the country’s environmental groups warn. “Cameroon’s ability to host the 2019 Africa football Cup of Nations depends on the availability of adapted modern infrastructure,” said Oumarou Tado, secretary general of Cameroon’s Ministry of Sports and Physical Education. “It is regrettable that many of these new projects have led to vast deforestation - but we had to meet the strict (guidelines) of the African football confederation,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. In Yaounde, the capital, about 34 hectares of trees were cut to build the new Olembe stadium, about 13 km from the centre of the city. In Limbe, 30 hectares of forests were removed to create space for a stadium and a sport training facility. Much more land has been cleared to build other facilities related to the 2019 competition, including roads, hotels and large new tracts of housing, environmentalists say. Part of what has driven tree cutting, Tado said, is that specifications for Cup of Nations infrastructure improvements require the new facilities to be built in areas that are easily accessible but without traffic problems. “These specifications were found in forested areas on the outskirts of major cities,” he said. Cameroon’s legendary World Cup soccer player Roger Milla, a sports ambassador for the country, said forested areas had to give way to improve the country’s sporting facilities, noting that “to make omelets one has to break eggs”. “Cameroon is a lead football nation in Africa but paradoxically without modern sports infrastructure. We have been waiting for this for a long time,” said Milla, whose foundation Coeur d’Afrique has taken part in tree planting efforts in Yaounde since 2016. Environment experts, however, have criticised the decision to build on forested areas, saying urban trees must be protected if the country is to avoid worsening impacts of climate change, including flooding and droughts. “Forests are very important in regulating city climate, thus their loss or degradation is a major source of emissions of carbon dioxide, which contributes to climate change and is a big threat to the livelihood of the population,” said Samuel Nguifo, executive director of the Centre for Environment and Development, a Yaounde environmental non-profit. He said forests act as “air conditioners” for cities, cooling residents suffering increasingly hot weather. Cameroon has in recent years seen large areas of forest cut for mining projects, new ports, hydroelectric dams and other projects under the country’s Vision 2035 project. That economic development plan aims to slash widespread unemployment and cut Cameroon’s poverty rate from 40 percent in 2007 to less than 20 percent by 2035. Between 2001 and 2016, Cameroon lost nearly 900,000 hectares of trees - a 2.8 percent reduction in the country’s forests, according to 2017 data from Global Forest Watch, a forest monitoring initiative. More than half of all the tree losses were in the Centre, South, East and Littoral regions where most new investment projects are concentrated, the data showed. Adding football infrastructure has now made the pressure on Cameroon’s existing “deforestation hotspots” worse, forest experts said. “These new sports infrastructure projects will only increase the susceptibility of these cities to the effects of climate change,” said Julius Chuezi Tieguhong, a forest researcher with the African Forest Forum. The cities of Douala, Yaounde and Limbe have in recent years faced worsening water shortages, floods and rising temperatures - all problems likely to become worse as forest is cut, Tieguhong said. In 2017, some roads and buildings in Cameroon’s economic hub, Douala, were submerged following days of heavy rains, while in Yaounde the sight of women and children trekking across the city to fetch scarce drinking water has become increasingly common. Cameroon’s government, however, is hopeful that teaming up with city authorities to plant more urban trees can offset some of the damage. Jules Doret Ndongo, the country’s Ministry of Forestry and Wildlife, this month signed a deal with 15 city councils in 10 regions of the country to plant more city trees and create new parks. The effort “is a combined forest, floods, drought and water shortage protection effort,” he said. The government says city councils will receive over 600 million FCFA ($1 million) annually to help curb deforestation. According to Bruno Mfou’ou Mfou’ou, director of forestry in the Ministry of Forestry and Wildlife, tree planting efforts will target areas particularly suffering flooding or drought. “Targeting vulnerable areas is critical in the fight against climate disasters,” he said. The city tree project comes on top of a 2017 government project that aims to restore 12 million hectares  of deforested land in the country, Mfou’ou Mfou’ou noted.

2018-06-01,"HONOLULU (Reuters) - The Hawaii community hardest hit by the Kilauea Volcano was ordered sealed off under a strict new mandatory evacuation on Thursday as the eruption marked its fourth week with no end in sight.  The Big Island’s mayor, Harry Kim, declared a roughly 17-block swath of the lava-stricken Leilani Estates subdivision off-limits indefinitely and gave any residents remaining there 24 hours to leave or face possible arrest. The mandatory evacuation zone lies within a slightly larger area that was already under a voluntary evacuation and curfew. The latest order was announced a day after police arrested a 62-year-old Leilani Estates resident who fired a handgun over the head of a younger man from the same community, apparently believing his neighbor was an intruder or looter. The confrontation on Tuesday was recorded on cell phone video that later went viral. But the mandatory evacuation was “decided prior to that incident,” said David Mace, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency currently assigned to the Hawaii County Civil Defense authority. Civil defense officials have previously said about 2,000 residents in and around Leilani Estates were displaced at the outset of the current eruption, which began on May 3.  But the total number of evacuees was estimated to have risen to about 2,500 after authorities ushered residents from the nearby Kapoho area as a precaution on Wednesday, as a lava flow threatened to cut off a key access road. At least 75 homes — most of them in Leilani Estates — have been devoured by streams of red-hot molten rock creeping from about two dozen large volcanic vents, or fissures, that have opened in the ground since Kilauea rumbled back to life four weeks ago. Lava flows also have knocked out power and telephone lines in the region, disrupting communications. Besides spouting fountains of lava around the clock, the fissures have released high levels of toxic sulfur dioxide gas on a near constant basis, posing an ongoing health hazard. Meanwhile, the main summit crater has periodically erupted in clouds of volcanic ash that create breathing difficulties and other problems for residents living downwind. The heightened volcanic activity has been accompanied by frequent earthquakes, as magma — the term for lava before it reaches the surface — pushes its way up from deep inside the earth and exerts tremendous force underground. After a month of continual eruptions at Kilauea’s summit and along its eastern flank, geologists say they have no idea how much longer it will last. “There’s no sign we’re getting that anything is going to slow down at the moment,” Wendy STOVL, a vulcanologist for the U.S. Geological Survey, told reporters on a conference call on Thursday. “We don’t see any changes occurring.” The island’s mayor on Wednesday renewed an emergency proclamation for 60 more days, allowing construction of temporary shelters and other relief projects to proceed on an expedited basis, without reviews and permits normally required. The month-old eruption of Kilauea, one of the world’s most active volcanoes, followed an eruption cycle that had continued almost nonstop for 35 years. Stovall said geologists now believe the latest upheaval should be classified as a separate volcanic event, though an official determination has yet to be made.

Japan’s Nikkei shed 0.1 percent. “The downward correction in equity markets is likely to continue, as the United States has opened up a new point of contention on the trade front by getting involved with the European Union,” said Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo. “President (Donald) Trump has not accomplished very much in terms of trade issues and is likely to remain vocal with the U.S. midterm elections coming up.” Investor focus on Friday is also on Chinese markets with the country’s mainland shares scheduled to join index publisher MSCI’s emerging market index. The inclusion was seen as potentially increasing investment from global investors into China’s capital markets. In currencies, the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso were on the defensive, weighed by the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on aluminium and steel imports from these countries. The euro was little changed at $1.1687 holding to modest gains made on relief overnight as Italy’s anti-establishment parties reached a deal to resurrect their proposed coalition government. The deal by the Italian parties averted the prospect of a new snap election, which had rattled global markets earlier this week and sent the euro to a 10-month low of $1.1510 on Tuesday. The dollar was steady at 108.830 yen, having lost about 0.5 percent against this week as the earlier global market tumult had enhanced demand for the Japanese currency, which is a perceived safe-haven. Brent crude rose 0.2 percent to $77.73 a barrel. Prices swerved between $$74.49, a three-week low, to $78.75 this week on speculation towards output by major oil-producing nations. U.S. crude was down 0.1 percent at $66.97 a barrel. Brent’s premium over U.S. crude reached its widest since March 2015 this week as a lack of pipeline capacity in the United States has trapped a lot of output inland.

2018-06-01,"WELLINGTON/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - New Zealand has set out to burnish its clean, green image by becoming Asia Pacific’s first developed economy to stop using fossil fuels to generate power, although the pitfalls encountered by a Maori iwi, or tribe, may signal trouble ahead.  The 3,000-member Ngaati Kea Ngaati Tuara iwi in Rotorua, when switching to renewables, found local geothermal sources were not hot enough to generate electricity.  So, the tribe set up small hydro units for its meeting ground and dairy farm,  but the units struggle to operate during floods and to produce enough power at peak demand, said project manager Eugene Berryman-Kamp. A battery could store energy for periods of high use, but there is currently “no appetite” to invest the more than $10,000 needed, he said.  New Zealand, in its push to be free of power fired by coal and natural gas, would likely face similar problems scaled to national size and potentially billions of dollars in costs.  “If we move too quickly, the risk is to the New Zealand consumer having to pay more for their energy and (this) could make New Zealand less competitive as a market,” said Marc England, chief executive of New Zealand’s biggest energy retailer and fourth-biggest generator, Genesis Energy (GNE.NZ).  Other countries that have turned fully to renewables for power - such as Norway and Denmark - are connected to regional grids that can help back up shortages. New Zealand, in the remote South Pacific, would not have that option.  For graphic on New Zealand power prices are low click reut.rs/2rzuBcn New Zealand would need large batteries, extra wind and solar power, and might still need to use gas or coal to prevent blackouts. Such investments would send costs soaring and could alienate voters who elected Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern last year, in part due to her pledge to counter climate change.  Ardern said in April the government was also halting new offshore oil and gas exploration permits as part of efforts to convert the nation to renewable energy by 2035.  Critics say Ardern’s goals would require huge investments in renewable energy sources, grid expansion, and an overhaul of New Zealand’s biggest export industry, dairy, which relies heavily on coal, driving up power prices.  Sapere Research Group advised Wellington its goals would require wholesale electricity prices to rise by up to 60 percent to around NZ$100 ($70) per megawatt-hour (MWh), making them some of the highest in the world.  That would destroy a key advantage for agriculture and industry in New Zealand, where baseload power futures are currently running about 25 percent less than in Australian states New South Wales and Victoria, where soaring electricity costs have forced some manufacturers to shut.  A backlash from industry and politicians has deepened partisan fault lines that Ardern’s center-left government, installed in October, is trying so smooth over. But the criticism has not stopped her from looking to establish a legacy by combating climate change.  Ardern’s government has set a goal for the country to be carbon neutral by 2050 - emitting no more carbon dioxide than its biosphere can absorb - an effort she compares to an earlier generation standing against nuclear warfare and declaring New Zealand a “nuclear free” zone.  Climate Change Minister James Shaw has set up a panel to develop a carbon neutrality plan by mid-2019, and a public and business consultation is scheduled for June.      “We need to be looking at ... more renewable generation and potentially storage to replace our aging fossil fuel generators, as well as energy efficiency initiatives to better manage demand,” Shaw told Reuters.  New Zealand gets more than 80 percent of its energy from renewables, mostly hydropower. Another 14 percent comes from natural gas and 3 percent from coal.  Fonterra Co-operative Group (FCG.NZ), however, the world’s top dairy exporter and one of New Zealand’s biggest energy users, gets around two-thirds of its energy from fossil fuels.  Fonterra is trying to ditch coal, but a change is going to “require significant investment”, said Chief Operating Officer Robert Spurway.  “It’s very important to us that we find ways to do this in an economically sustainable way so that we remain competitive globally,” Spurway told Reuters.  Part of the problem is that while most of the population and industry is on the North Island, most of the hydro stations are on the South Island. That increases the outage risk because of the possibility of damage to the cables connecting the two islands. “The inconvenient truth in New Zealand is for decades we’ve used coal to back up hydroelectricity,” Genesis CEO England told Reuters. New Zealand’s biggest power plant, Huntly, owned by Genesis, was due to shut its coal units in 2018, but rival generator Meridian Energy (MEL.NZ) agreed to pay Genesis to keep them open as back-up at least until 2022.           Genesis said batteries are not yet an economic option to fall back on through extended droughts. New Zealand lakes have only up to eight weeks of water storage, while hydropower-dependent Norway has about two years’ worth.  Many analysts still say New Zealand’s plan to go green is viable and will benefit the country, although England said switching to electric vehicles (EV) to wean transport off petrol would be better than 100 percent renewable power generation.  “(EV) could be a better economic choice for the market as a whole,” he said.  Berryman-Kamp said power independence has become a point of pride for the Ngaati Kea Ngaati Tuara iwi, and that he gets requests each month from other tribes interested in making similar changes.  “They like the idea that we’re self-sufficient ... They like the idea that we’re minimizing environmental impact.”  Reporting by Charlotte Greenfield in WELLINGTON and Sonali Paul in MELBOURNE; Editing by Tom Hogue",https://uk.reuters.com/article/newzealand-energy/analysis-new-zealand-push-on-clean-power-comes-with-high-political-economic-risks-idUKL3N1SG09I,01 Jun 2018,"* Government has banned new offshore oil, gas exploration

2018-06-01,"SINGAPORE, June 1 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil steadied on Friday after deep losses in the previous session on pressure from all-time high U.S. production and expectations of higher OPEC output. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 2 cents to $67.06 a barrel by 0805 GMT after dropping almost 2 percent on Thursday. Brent crude, which was little changed in the previous session, added 17 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $77.73 per barrel. U.S. crude production has been rising to record high levels since late last year. In March it jumped 215,000 bpd to 10.47 million bpd, a new monthly record, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Thursday. Still, U.S. crude stockpiles fell 3.6 million barrels last week, the EIA said, exceeding expectations for a decline of 525,000 barrels. “A drop in inventories in the U.S. was overshadowed by U.S. output which jumped to a record high level,” ANZ said in a note. “With the markets still concerned about supply-side issues in OPEC, this has pushed the Brent-WTI spread out to nearly $11/bbl, the highest level for three years.” Brent hit a three-week low below $75 a barrel on Monday after OPEC and its allies, including Russia, indicated they could adjust their deal to curb supplies and increase production, but recovered later in the week. OPEC and non-OPEC producers have committed to cut output by 1.8 million bpd until the end of 2018 but are ready to make gradual supply adjustments to deal with shortages, a Gulf source familiar with Saudi thinking told Reuters late on Wednesday. Sources told Reuters last week that Saudi Arabia, the effective leader of OPEC, and Russia were discussing boosting output by about 1 million bpd to compensate for losses in supply from Venezuela and to address concerns about the impact of U.S. sanctions on Iranian output. Russia would be able to raise its oil output back to pre-cut levels within months if there is a decision to unwind the price-protection deal with OPEC and other producers, a Russian energy ministry official said. Concerns about U.S. bottlenecks are contributing to the decline in U.S. futures as well. Prices for physical barrels of U.S. light sweet crude delivered at Midland are at their largest discount to the benchmark U.S. futures price in almost four years.

2018-06-01,"(Corrects in sixth paragraph Venezuela’s production figures to 17.3 million barrels in March and 13.2 million barrels in February from 13.2 million bpd in March.     ) By Scott DiSavino and Jessica Resnick-Ault May 31 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil production jumped 215,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 10.47 million bpd in March, the highest on record, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in a monthly report on Thursday. Production in Texas rose by 4 percent to almost 4.2 million bpd, a record high based on the data going back to 2005. The Permian basin, which stretches across West Texas and eastern New Mexico, is the largest U.S. oilfield. Output from North Dakota held around 1.2 million bpd, while output in the federal Gulf of Mexico declined 1.1 percent to 1.7 million bpd. The agency also revised February oil production down by 5,000 bpd to 10.26 million bpd. U.S. crude oil output C-OUT-T-EIA rose above 10 million bpd late last year for the first time since the 1970s, overtaking top oil exporter Saudi Arabia PRODN-SA, but it still lags behind top producer Russia, which pumps just below 11 million bpd C-RU-OUT. U.S. oil imports from Venezuela increased to 17.3 million barrels in March from 13.21 barrels in February. Last month’s level was close to the all-time low of 13.20 million barrels, reported in January 2003. OPEC-member Venezuela’s oil output has declined amid political unrest. Gasoline demand in March was 9.4 million bpd, up 1 percent, or 94,000 bpd, from a year earlier, according to the report. At the same time, gasoline exports rose to 951,000 bpd, up 361,000 bpd from a year earlier. Demand for distillate fuels, including diesel and heating oil was 4.2 million bpd, up 0.4 percent, or 15,000 bpd, from a year earlier. Distillate fuel exports were 1.15 million bpd in the month, down about 12,000 bpd from a year earlier. U.S. natural gas production in the lower 48 states rose to an all-time high of 88.8 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in March, up from the prior record of 87.7 bcfd in February, according to EIA’s 914 production report. Output in Texas, the nation’s largest gas producer, increased 1.3 percent in March to 22.7 bcfd, the most since April 2016. In Pennsylvania, the second biggest gas producing state, production dipped to 16.4 bcfd in March, down 0.6 percent from February’s record high of 16.5 bcfd. That compares with output of 14.8 bcfd in March 2017. The United States has been the world’s biggest producer of gas since 2009, ahead of Russia.

2018-06-01,"May 31 (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp said on Thursday it was scrapping a plan to build two nuclear reactors at a U.S. power plant after long delays in which it failed to find investors because of sharply lower electricity rates and increased global regulation. Toshiba America Nuclear Energy Corp, the Japanese company’s wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, reached an agreement in March 2008 to build the third and fourth reactors for utility NRG Energy Inc’s South Texas Project. The plant has two 1,280-megawatt reactors. NRG in 2011 abandoned and wrote off its investment in the project, citing U.S. regulatory uncertainty in the wake of Japan’s 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident. The project is part of the Nuclear Innovation North America, or NINA, which is 90 percent owned by New Jersey-based NRG and 10 percent owned by Toshiba. “No investors have expressed an interest in participation,” Toshiba said in a statement, noting that the project had “ceased to be financially viable.” The Fukushima nuclear disaster, the worst since Chernobyl in 1986, forced a reassessment of atomic power, and cheap shale gas and coal has led to the closure of several older plants in the United States.

2018-06-01,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Airline executives are gathering in Sydney’s winter chill under the shadow of higher oil prices and a string of accidents after enjoying a near-spotless 2017 in terms of profits and safety. The annual meeting of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), with 130 CEOs and 1,000 delegates, will kick off on Sunday, and worries that a three-year run of unusually high returns might end are in the spotlight. Meeting host Qantas Airways Ltd (QAN.AX), led by outspoken Irish-born CEO Alan Joyce, has to many embodied the industry’s turnaround.  The Australian airline, nicknamed the “Flying Kangaroo,” swung from a record loss in 2014 to forecast a record profit in the financial year ending June 30 as it cut costs, boosted revenue and benefited from lower oil prices. Shares have risen six-fold since late 2013. But now, like other carriers, it is grappling with the return of $80 a barrel oil, rising airport charges and a global pilot shortage that has led it to cancel flights and invest A$20 million (£11.4 million) in a new training school. IATA, which represents about 280 airlines comprising 83 percent of global air traffic, in December predicted a record $38.4 billion of net profit for the airline industry in 2018, with $27.9 billion coming from U.S. and European airlines. That estimate, however, assumed an average oil price of $60 a barrel in 2018. An updated profit forecast to be issued on Monday will be lower, as the cost of oil, infrastructure and labour rises, IATA CEO Alexandre de Juniac told reporters in Sydney on Thursday. “We have seen a rise in the fuel cost now for almost 15 months,” he said. “Usually you see an impact on fares 10 to 12 months after, but for the moment I have to say the fuel increase has not been passed on in fares.” Major U.S. airlines, the biggest of which have not hedged fuel costs, reported a 24 percent, or $600 million, decline in pre-tax profits in the quarter that ended March 31 compared with a year earlier as rising costs crimped margins, according to data from trade group Airlines for America. Several major airline CEOs, notably in Europe, have warned that rising oil prices could put pressure on carriers in the northern hemisphere summer. That might lead to further consolidation or bankruptcies after the collapse of Air Berlin and Monarch Airlines last year. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see a few of these weaker carriers slip further into difficulties and potentially see some exits from the market in the latter part of this year,” Willie Walsh, CEO of British Airways and Iberian parent IAG (ICAG.L), said in early May. Lower oil prices have allowed airlines to expand rapidly, with lower costs helping spur 7.6 percent growth in passenger demand last year, well above the 10-year average annual growth rate of 5.5 percent. “If they are forced to start raising prices, that traffic growth could very quickly disappear at the same time that profits disappear,” said Peter Harbison, Executive Chairman of CAPA Centre for Aviation.  Trans-Atlantic flying remains uncertain because of the need to pursue post-Brexit deals. But a long-running dispute between U.S. and Gulf carriers that had led to vigorous debate over subsidies at previous IATA gatherings has finally been put to rest. That could leave more time for industry leaders to focus on improving safety after a poor start to the year following a 2017 performance so positive that U.S. President Donald Trump in January took credit for “the best and safest year on record” in a tweet. Five serious aviation accidents have killed 301 people in the first five months of 2018, according to Reuters calculations, which compares with just 19 on-board fatalities in all of 2017.
