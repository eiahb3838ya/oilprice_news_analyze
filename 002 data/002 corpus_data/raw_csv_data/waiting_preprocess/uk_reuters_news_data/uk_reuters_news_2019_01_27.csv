2019-01-27,"UNITED NATIONS/CARACAS (Reuters) - The United States on Saturday called on the world to “pick a side” on Venezuela and urged countries to financially disconnect from Nicolas Maduro’s government, while European powers signalled they were set to follow Washington in recognising Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country’s rightful leader. In heated back-and-forth exchanges at a United Nations Security Council meeting, the opposing camp led by Venezuela and Russia, which has invested heavily in Venezuela’s oil industry, accused Washington of attempting a coup, and lambasted Europeans’ demand that elections be called within eight days. Guaido, who took the helm of the National Assembly on Jan. 5, proclaimed himself interim president on Wednesday. The United States, Canada and a string of Latin American countries recognised the young leader in quick succession. Maduro, who has led the oil-rich nation since 2013 and has the support of the armed forces, has refused to stand down. But on Saturday Guaido, 35, gained support from a key military official. Venezuela’s defence attache to Washington, Colonel Jose Luis Silva, told Reuters that he has broken with the Maduro government and recognised Guaido as interim president.    Speaking at the U.N. meeting, called by the United States, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Maduro’s “socialist experiment” had caused the economy to collapse and reduced ordinary Venezuelans to rooting through dumpsters for food. “Now it is time for every other nation to pick a side. ... Either you stand with the forces of freedom, or you’re in league with Maduro and his mayhem,” Pompeo told the council. “We call on all members of the Security Council to support Venezuela’s democratic transition and interim President Guaido’s role.” Pompeo also called on the international community to disconnect their financial systems from Maduro’s government. Washington has signalled it was ready to step up economic measures to try to drive Maduro from power, but on Saturday Pompeo declined to elaborate on any such plans. By overcoming opposition to holding the U.N. meeting on Saturday, Washington successfully put the global spotlight on Venezuela as a Security Council problem. However, any council action to address the crisis would be blocked by veto-powers Russia and China, diplomats said. Britain, Germany, France and Spain all said on Saturday they would recognise Guaido if Maduro failed to call fresh elections within eight days, an ultimatum Russia said was “absurd” and the Venezuelan foreign minister called “childlike.” “Europe is giving us eight days? Where do you get that you have the power to establish a deadline or an ultimatum to a sovereign people?” Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told the Security Council.  Russia also said military intervention in Venezuela should be avoided at any cost, while Caracas reiterated that its offer of dialogue with President Donald Trump’s government was still on the table despite his administration’s two-year campaign against Maduro. “If President Trump, like other presidents of the United States, is in search of war to show he can govern and to stimulate the economy, he won’t get that war in Venezuela,” Arreaza told reporters later. Venezuela has sunk into turmoil under Maduro with food shortages and protests amid an economic and political crisis that has sparked mass emigration and inflation that is seen rising to 10 million percent this year. Maduro cruised to re-election last May. The opposition largely boycotted the vote after its senior leaders were blocked from taking part. Critics accused the government of vote buying. The domestic opposition, the United States and right-leaning Latin American governments declined to recognise the result of the ballot. Venezuelan opposition sympathizers had been urging Guaido to assume the presidency since Maduro was inaugurated for a second term on Jan. 10. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets in Caracas earlier this week, calling on Maduro to step down. Guaido’s declaration of himself as the interim president takes Venezuela into uncharted territory, with the possibility of the opposition now running a parallel government recognised abroad as legitimate but without control over state functions. After the Security Council debate, Guaido sent a letter to Secretary General Antonio Guterres asking the United Nations for help addressing hunger, violence and the lack of medicines in his country.  The United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. Guaido celebrated the support of European countries and also asked them to send humanitarian aid to help relieve the economic crisis. “We woke up today with nothing less than the full support of the European community,” Guaido said at a small political event in a square in the capital Caracas. “Several European countries have been in touch with us and are going to support the entry of humanitarian aid. ... We continue adding countries to this great effort,” he said. The Maduro government has previously rejected such aid, denying there is a humanitarian crisis in the country and blaming economic problems on sanctions. After Washington’s declaration of support for Guaido, Maduro cut off diplomatic relations with the United States on Wednesday and gave U.S. diplomats 72 hours to leave the country.  Some U.S. embassy staff left Caracas on Friday, and Venezuela was withdrawing staff from Washington on Saturday, Venezuela’s foreign ministry said in a statement However, Maduro softened his demand that all U.S. embassy staff withdraw by Saturday. Instead, the two countries will seek an agreement to replace the embassies with “Interest Offices” in their respective capitals within 30 days, the statement said. If that fails, the missions would close.

2019-01-27,"BERLIN, Jan 27 (Reuters) - German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said exiting coal as an energy source would send a positive signal internationally, and need not necessarily drive German energy prices higher. Schulze told the Funke Mediengruppe newspaper chain she was satisfied with the work of a government-appointed commission, which on Saturday proposed shutting down the last of Germany’s coal-fired power plants by 2038 at the latest. A member of the Social Democrats, junior partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling coalition, Schulze said she had not studied the commission’s recommendations in detail, but studies conducted by her ministry had shown than exiting coal would “by no means lead to higher electricity prices.” “I am convinced that a strong industrial country like Germany can master the energy revolution and become stronger and more modern in the process,” she added. She said regions that now produced coal would remain important players in the German energy market through investment in new technologies, renewables, and climate protection. A government-appointed commission on Saturday proposed providing at least 40 billion euros ($45.7 billion) in aid to regions affected by the phase-out. The proposals must now be implemented by the German government and 16 regional states. They embody Germany’s strategy to shift to renewable energy, which made up more than 40 percent of the energy mix last year — beating coal for the first time — and follow a 2011 decision to halt nuclear power.

2019-01-27,"DOHUK, Iraq (Reuters) - One protester was killed and at least 10 others wounded when they stormed a Turkish military camp near Dohuk in Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region on Saturday, burning two tanks and other vehicles, residents and Kurdish officials said. Najib Saeed, the chief health official in the area, said it was not yet clear what caused the death. He said Turkish soldiers had shot at protesters and that the burning of vehicles and equipment had caused several explosions. Baghdad’s foreign ministry criticised the Turkish troops for opening fire and said it would summon Turkey’s ambassador over the incident. Turkey said the attack was carried out by members of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) who disguised themselves among civilians to fuel conflict between Turkish forces and local residents. “We are committed to maintaining our close partnership with the people of Dohuk and doing everything in our power to prevent civilian casualties in the area,” Fahrettin Altun, communications director for the Turkish Presidency, told Reuters. Turkey carries out regular air raids near the border against the PKK insurgent group which has bases in northern Iraq and has fought a decades-long insurgency in Turkey. The Kurdish government in Erbil in northern Iraq condemned the storming of the camp, accusing “saboteurs” of instigating the incident, a veiled reference to the PKK, a rival of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) that dominates the Erbil government and has a working relationship with Turkey. Erbil said it had sent its forces to the area to calm the situation. A Kurdish official in the region of Dohuk said the crowd was demonstrating over a recent Turkish air raid that killed four civilians. The official did not want to be named. A second Kurdish official, who also did not give his name, said Turkish troops at the camp in Shiladze, east of Dohuk, had initially shot at the protesters and then left the camp. Kurdish security forces are trying to control the situation, he said. The surprise announcement last month that U.S. forces would withdraw from neighbouring Syria, where they have been directing the fight against Islamic State, raised fears that Turkey would move against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces which it views as terrorists.  Turkey says the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia is an extension of the PKK. Trump has threatened economic ruin for Turkey should it attack the YPG, however.

2019-01-27,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - In an unprecedented move, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Saturday said he had fired his ambassador to China, who prompted a political furor with comments about Huawei’s high-profile extradition case. John McCallum had embarrassed Trudeau’s Liberal government by saying Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou could make a strong argument against being sent to the United States. Opposition legislators and former ambassadors accused McCallum of unacceptable political interference in an affair which has badly damaged relations between Canada and China. Meng, the daughter of Huawei’s founder, was arrested in Vancouver last month over alleged violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran.  China subsequently detained two Canadian citizens on national security grounds. A Chinese court later retried a Canadian man who had been jailed for drugs smuggling and sentenced him to death. “Last night I asked for and accepted John McCallum’s resignation as Canada’s ambassador to China,” Trudeau said in a statement that did not explain his reasons. Veteran diplomats and experts told Reuters it was the first time a Canadian ambassador had ever been officially fired. Trudeau said as recently as Thursday that he had no plans to replace McCallum, who apologized the same day for his remarks earlier in the week. But the Toronto Star newspaper on Friday quoted the envoy as saying that if Washington dropped the extradition request “that would be great for Canada”. McCallum, 68, a long-time former Liberal cabinet minister, is not a trained diplomat. Brock University professor Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat who had served two postings in China, said McCallum’s comments on Meng possibly avoiding extradition had signaled to Beijing that its hard line tactics were working. “He really made it untenable for the prime minister to sustain him (in his post) for any length of time and he had to go,” Burton said by telephone, suggesting Trudeau should quickly appoint a special envoy to handle the dispute. Spokespeople for Trudeau and Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland declined to comment when asked about the dismissal. Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, said in a tweet that Trudeau “should have fired his ambassador the moment he interfered in this case” and accused the prime minister of weakness and indecision. Polls show the Liberals have a slender lead over the Conservatives ahead of a federal election this October.

2019-01-27,"MANILA (Reuters) - Twin bombings during a church service in the southern Philippines killed at least 21 people and wounded 71, security officials said, days after a referendum on autonomy for the mainly Muslim region returned an overwhelming “yes” vote. The first explosion went off inside the cathedral in Jolo, on the island province of Sulu, and was followed by a second blast in the car park outside, killing military and civilians, officials said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. It followed Friday’s announcement that the region, a mainly Muslim part of the predominantly Catholic Philippines, had approved a plan to govern itself by 2022, boosting hopes for peace in one of Asia’s poorest and most conflict-torn regions.  Monday’s referendum saw 85 percent of voters back the creation of an autonomous area called Bangsamoro. Although Sulu was among only a few areas that rejected autonomy, it will still be part of the new entity. Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana called the attack a “dastardly act” and urged the local population to be vigilant and work with the authorities to “deny terrorism any victory”. “We will use the full force of the law to bring to justice the perpetrators behind this incident,” he said in a statement. Civilians bore the brunt of the attack, which also killed at least seven soldiers.  Colonel Gerry Besana, spokesman of the military’s Western Mindanao Command, said an examination of the bomb materials should reveal who was behind it.  National police chief Oscar Albayalde said it was possible the militant Abu Sayyaf group could be involved. “They want to disturb the peace and order, they want to show force and sow chaos,” Albayalde said on radio. Jolo is a stronghold of the Abu Sayyaf, which has a reputation for bombings and brutality, and for having pledged allegiance to Islamic State. The militant group is also heavily involved in piracy and kidnapping. Last week’s referendum came at a critical time for the Philippines, which hopes to end decades of separatist conflict in Mindanao that experts say has given rise to extremism.  That has stoked fears that foreign radicals will gravitate to Mindanao to capitalize on porous borders, jungles and mountains, and an abundance of arms.

2019-01-27,"PARIS (Reuters) - Thousands of “yellow vest” demonstrators marched through Paris and other cities on Saturday on the 11th weekend of action against the government, suggesting President Emmanuel Macron has yet to defuse public opposition to some of his policies. The protests were mostly peaceful but there were sporadic clashes at the end of the Paris march at Bastille square, and incidents elsewhere around France, with a combined 22,000 people attending as of the early afternoon, the interior ministry said. The protests - named after the fluorescent jackets French motorists are required to carry in their cars - began in mid-November over plans to raise fuel taxes before developing into a broader revolt against the government that mobilised tens of thousands each weekend. Turnout so far was lower than last Saturday, particularly in Paris. However, in a change of approach, some protesters have also called for an evening gathering, dubbed “Yellow Night”, at Republic square, a common venue for demonstrations in Paris. In one of several processions in the capital, a few hundred demonstrators walked down the Champs-Elysees, the famous avenue that has been the scene of protests every weekend, and across town to Bastille square. As in previous weeks, protesters carried French flags and held signs attacking “King Macron” as out of touch or calling for referendums tabled by ordinary citizens. As the march converged on Bastille, small groups of protesters formed makeshift barriers, lit fires and threw projectiles at police, who responded with tear gas and water canon, television footage showed. Police made 42 arrests in Paris, prefectural authorities said. But as on the last two Saturdays in the capital, the incidents were minor compared with the violence seen in December - the worst trouble of its kind in decades in Paris. Elsewhere in France, protesters marched through the eastern city of Strasbourg to the European Parliament.  In the southwest, marches took place in Bordeaux and Toulouse, which have been focal points of the movement, while there were some confrontations during protests in Marseille and Lyon. To help quell discontent, Macron this month launched a series of public debates that he promised will lead to measures. In a sign of divisions within the movement, some “yellow vests” have proposed a list of candidates to run in May’s election for the European Parliament, a move attacked as a betrayal by other activists. Those opposed to the movement, meanwhile, are planning a counter-demonstration in Paris on Sunday, mainly to condemn the violence seen during the protests.

2019-01-27,"FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Operators of Germany’s coal-fired power plans will have to negotiate compensation with the authorities for accelerating moves to phase out use of the fuel, a report said on Saturday, with the prospect that payouts could run into billions of euros. A commission has set out proposals for ending the use of coal as a power source by 2038 in Europe’s biggest economy, affecting operators RWE, Uniper, EnBW, Vattenfall, Steag and LEAG.  The fuel now generates 38 percent of Germany’s electricity. The government-appointed body’s proposals will serve as the basis for turning the phase-out into law and means several coal-fired power stations will close earlier than expected. “The commission recommends a mutual agreement with the operators on a contractual basis with regard to the shutdown,” the commission’s final report seen by Reuters said, adding this would include agreeing on the size of any compensation. Shareholders and utility investors have been waiting for months for details about what payments would be offered. The report said ways to determine compensation could include capacity tenders or keeping plants on standby, similar to existing reserve payments for operators that have totalled as much as 150 million euros (129 million pounds) per gigawatt per year in the past. Of Germany’s total installed power generation capacity, which stood at 218 GW at the end of 2017, hard-coal and lignite plants accounted for 46 GW, or more than a fifth, suggesting billions of euros in overall compensation payments. RWE, Germany’s biggest power producer and the largest operator of coal-fired plants at 13.3 GW of capacity, said 2038 was too soon, urging lawmakers to consider extending this during a review in 2032. “We are obliged to protect the interests of our employees as well as our shareholders,” RWE Chief Executive Rolf Martin Schmitz said in a statement. The 336-page report by the commission said: “If there are auctions, avoiding forced layoffs as well as unfair social and economic disadvantages for the affected employees is a necessary precondition.” Compensation should apply to plants in operation and those that have not yet entered service or were still being built, which includes Uniper’s Datteln 4 plant, the report said. The older the plants, the lower the compensation, it added. Eckhardt Ruemmler, chief operating officer of Uniper, which operates 3.8 GW of coal-fired capacity in Germany, said the report suggested the Datteln 4, a 1.05 GW coal plant that has so far cost 1.2 billion euros, would never enter service. “In light of the enormous investment and contractual obligations related to the project this requires substantial talks - including with our clients of the plant,” Ruemmler said. “The plant is central to our corporate planning.”  Swedish state-owned utility Vattenfall and EnBW, which is almost entirely in the hands of one of Germany’s federal states and local municipalities, welcomed the decision to phase-out coal plants by 2038. Vattenfall has sold most of its coal-fired power stations, but still runs a plant in Hamburg.

2019-01-27,"WASHINGTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - The United States on Friday signalled it was ready to step up economic measures to try to drive Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from power as some U.S. diplomats left the embassy in Caracas and Russia vowed to back its socialist South American ally. The U.S. Treasury Department stopped short of announcing a freeze on Venezuela’s U.S. assets and accounts, but said it would take steps to ensure commercial transactions were “consistent” with its recognition this week of opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate head of state. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday will urge members of the United Nations Security Council to recognise Guaido. Washington requested the meeting of the 15-member council after a string of countries threw their weight behind Guaido, who heads Venezuela’s congress, and urged Maduro to step down. Pompeo will be accompanied by former U.S. diplomat Elliott Abrams, who he named on Friday to lead U.S. efforts on Venezuela. Abrams is a neoconservative who has long advocated an activist U.S. role in the world. Russia opposes the U.S. efforts and has accused Washington of backing a coup attempt, placing Venezuela at the heart of a growing geopolitical duel. Private military contractors who carry out secret missions for Russia have flown into Venezuela in the past few days to beef up security for Maduro, sources said.   Maduro said he welcomed the U.N. debate. “Thanks, Mike,” he said, tongue in cheek, during a Friday news conference. “We’re going to tell the truth about the articles of the constitution, about the coup.” Maduro on Wednesday ordered U.S. diplomats out of the country within 72 hours. On Friday, some American diplomats left the U.S. embassy in Caracas in a convoy of vehicles with a police escort en route to the airport, according to a Reuters witness.  U.N. human rights boss Michelle Bachelet called on Friday for an investigation into alleged excessive use of force by Venezuelan security forces against anti-Maduro protesters in recent days, adding that she was “extremely concerned” that the situation could rapidly spiral out of control. Guaido, who has galvanized Venezuela’s opposition, proclaimed himself interim president on Wednesday during a march of hundreds of thousands in Caracas. He is considering making a request for funds from international institutions including the International Monetary Fund, sources said on Friday. However, he still has no control over the Venezuelan state and the military, which has so far remained loyal to Maduro despite a deep economic and political crisis that has sparked mass emigration, with inflation forecast to rise to 10 million percent this year. Guaido has promised future amnesties to military members if they disavow Maduro, asking soldiers on Friday to “put themselves on the side of the constitution.” Most Latin American nations have joined the United States in supporting Guaido’s claim on the presidency, although Mexico’s new leftist government has said it would not take sides. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday his administration would be willing to mediate. Guaido said he would reject any negotiations that did not include Maduro’s exit, the setting up of a transition government, and free elections to pick a new president. “No one wants fake dialogue ... the only thing we want to negotiate is the end of the usurpation,” he told a crowd clustered in a plaza in Caracas’ Chacao district, an opposition stronghold. To ratchet up pressure on Maduro, who began a second term on Jan. 10 following an election last year widely considered to be a fraud, the United States is seeking to cut off funds for his government and is considering introducing fresh sanctions, including on its vital oil sector. Maduro warned off any attempt to take control of U.S. refiner Citgo [PDVSAC.UL], the country’s primary offshore asset. “It is the property of the Venezuelan people, and we will defend it,” he said. The Maduro-appointed board of Citgo is preparing a legal strategy to defend itself against any attempts to divert its funds or change its board, sources said. Oil prices edged higher on Friday as the political turmoil in the OPEC member threatened to tighten the global supply of crude. The U.S. has until now resisted significant oil sanctions because of the impact it would have on Venezuelan citizens already struggling with shortages. “The oil situation has been an ethical moral dilemma for us,” said U.S. Senator Richard Durbin, the no.2 Democrat in the Senate, in an interview. “Cutting off all trade in oil would be the last step. It would make it even worse for the average person.” The Trump administration is trying to make sure that any measures to restrict oil revenues to Maduro do not cause spikes in prices that would be felt by U.S. consumers, said Scott Modell, managing director of Rapidan Energy Group, who advises energy clients on geopolitical risks. “How do they allow Venezuelan oil to continue to flow, while cutting off the flow of money back to Maduro and the government? That’s the general playbook they have been using for Iran, and the one they are trying to adapt to Venezuela now,” Modell said.

2019-01-27,"WASHINGTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - The United States is seeking to ensure that Venezuelan oil revenue goes to opposition leader and self-declared interim president Juan Guaido, and to cut off money from isolated President Nicolas Maduro, a top U.S. official said on Thursday. Although short on details, the announcement signals that Washington is willing to go beyond traditional diplomatic measures and will seek to drain cash from Maduro’s government, which is already struggling under an unprecedented economic meltdown. Such a move would significantly strengthen the hand of Guaido, who swore himself in as interim head of state on Wednesday with the support of Washington and nations around the region. “What we’re focusing on today is disconnecting the illegitimate Maduro regime from the sources of his revenues,”  national security advisor John Bolton told reporters at the White House.  “We think consistent with our recognition of Juan Guaido as the constitutional interim president of Venezuela that those revenues should go to the legitimate government.” Bolton added that the process was “very complicated” and that officials were still studying how this would function. Venezuela’s information ministry did not reply to a request for comment. Guaido, in an interview with broadcaster Univision, said he believed this was “the beginning of the end” for Maduro and he would work to guarantee humanitarian aid and implement new economic measures to rachet up pressure. “Our challenge is to secure free elections, and we want them as soon as possible. But we are living in a dictatorship,” he said, from an undisclosed location. Washington’s support for Guaido prompted Maduro, Venezuela’s leader since 2013, to break relations with the United States. On Thursday, he said he was closing Venezuela’s embassy in Washington and its consulates in the United States. Guaido’s swearing-in was the opposition’s boldest challenge yet to the long-ruling Socialist Party and has given Maduro’s adversaries an unprecedented diplomatic platform to press for change in a nation dogged by hyperinflation, rising malnutrition and political conflict.                     But Guaido now leads what amounts to a shadow government disavowed by the armed forces and with no influence over day-to-day administration such as importing and distributing food and medicine. The 35-year-old industrial engineer said he had spoken on Thursday by telephone with supportive heads of state from around the world.  In the Univision interview, Guaido repeated his proposal of future amnesties to officials and military members who disavowed Maduro, even saying the offer could be extended to government ministers and to Maduro himself if they willingly left power. Guaido’s ascent was greeted with excitement by investors holding Venezuela and state oil company PDVSA bonds, which hit their highest level since 2017 despite being almost entirely in default. Concerns about potential disruption of Venezuelan crude supplies gave support to global oil prices. Oil revenues are crucial to the already crumbling Venezuelan economy and routing that money away from Maduro as the United State seeks to do would be a serious blow. The U.S. State Department on Thursday ordered some U.S. government workers to leave Venezuela and said U.S. citizens should consider leaving the country.  Guaido took the helm of the National Assembly on Jan. 5 with a call for the armed forces to recognise Maduro as a “usurper” after his May 2018 re-election, widely viewed as fraudulent.     Backing for him has come principally from the Western hemisphere. Venezuelan allies including Russia and Turkey - both important commercial partners - criticized Guaido’s rise as a sign of U.S. interference. The European Union, which has imposed sanctions on Maduro’s government, noted that Venezuelans had “massively called for democracy and the possibility to freely determine their own destiny,” but stopped short of recognising Guaido. Maduro, in a rambling speech, dismissed Guaido’s inauguration and said he himself remained the country’s legitimate leader.  He has relied extensively on the military to maintain power amid annual inflation of nearly 2 million percent and an exodus of Venezuelan refugees into neighbouring countries. Guaido has said Maduro’s Jan. 10 inauguration to a second six-year term amounted to a usurpation of power. The vote was boycotted by Venezuela’s main opposition parties, with Maduro’s two most popular rivals banned from running and Socialist Party aggressive campaigning opponents called vote-buying. Guaido and allies argue that the presidency is vacant as a result and that the constitution calls for the head of congress to assume the interim presidency in such a situation. That still leaves Guaido struggling against a state unwilling to recognise him and security forces that could jail him, as they did his mentor Leopoldo Lopez - who is under house arrest for leading anti-Maduro protests in 2014. “Can he name ministers? Ministers of air? Phantom ministers?,” asked Maduro during a speech before the Supreme Court. “Is he going to name commanders of military units? Will the armed forces obey his command? Never.”  Protesters clashed with security forces on Wednesday night around the country and in both affluent and working class areas of Caracas, with some demonstrations spilling over into looting. A total of 14 people have been killed in violence linked to this week’s protests, according to local rights groups.

2019-01-27,"(Reuters) - Venezuela’s opposition has raised the stakes against President Nicolas Maduro after congress head Juan Guaido swore himself in as interim head of state with the support of the United States and some major Latin American nations.   Below is a summary of support for the rival leaders. * The top brass of Venezuela’s military has shown no sign of leaving Maduro’s side. Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino reaffirmed his support in a Tweet on Wednesday, saying Venezuela’s armed forces disavowed any self-proclaimed president. * The Supreme Court, stacked with Maduro loyalists, has remained solidly behind the socialist leader, ruling earlier this week that all actions taken by the congress - led by Guaido - are null and void. * Russia called Maduro the country’s legitimate president and accused the United States of trying to usurp power in Venezuela, warning Washington against military intervention. * President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey stood by Maduro, urging him to “stand tall”, Erdogan’s spokesman said. * China voiced support for Maduro, saying it opposed outside interference in Venezuela and backed efforts to protect its independence and stability. * State oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL], which accounts for most of Venezuela’s export earnings, stood by Maduro. “We have no other president” besides Maduro, said PDVSA President and Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo, a career military officer. * A few left-leaning governments in the region, including Cuba and Bolivia, continue to back Maduro. Mexico, where leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office last year, has dropped the previous government’s opposition to Maduro and said it will follow a policy of non-intervention.  * A diehard core of “Chavistas” in Venezuela, including armed gangs in poor urban areas, remain core to late leader Hugo Chavez’s exhortation to support Maduro come what may. * The United States recognised Guaido shortly after he proclaimed himself president, saying it would use its “economic and diplomatic power” to restore democracy in Venezuela. * Numerous right-leaning Latin American governments, including Brazil, Colombia and Argentina, also recognised Guaido. * The European Union’s executive called for new elections but declined to explicitly recognise Guaido as president. An EU statement urged authorities to respect his “civil rights, freedom and safety” and allow Venezuelans to freely determine their future.  * French President Emmanuel Macron saluted the courage of Venezuelans marching for freedom and called Maduro’s 2018 election victory illegal.  * A spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May said Maduro’s election was neither free nor fair, and expressed support for Guaido as national assembly head.  *  The German government said Venezuela’s parliament had “a special role” to play in securing Venezuela’s “free future”. * There are some signs that support for the opposition is expanding beyond its traditional middle- and upper-class areas. Several protests against Maduro have broken out in working-class neighbourhoods and slums this week.  * Some low-ranking military officers have expressed discontent with the government. The government on Monday said it suppressed a military revolt after a group of officers stole weapons, kidnapped officers, and demanded Maduro’s removal.

2019-01-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - European shares on Friday hit their highest level in nearly two months as positive earnings, hopes of accommodative U.S. monetary policies and higher oil and metal prices help fuel a global rally.  The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended the day up 0.6 percent near two-month highs, scored a fourth straight week of gain and was on course for its best month since October 2015. Frankfurt’s DAX was the top performer with a 1.4 percent rise while Britain’s exporter-heavy FTSE 100 underperformed as a stronger sterling weighed. Traders cited a Wall Street Journal report which said Federal Reserve officials were considering maintaining a larger portfolio of Treasury securities than earlier expected as a reason for better risk sentiment.  “Economic sentiment has been deteriorating for a while now but the difference between now and December is that central banks are reacting to it”, said Mizuho rates strategist Antoine Bouvet.  “That’s what is leading to this improving risk tone”, he argued, adding that “the risk of unwarranted tightening of conditions is lower.”   Investors also shrugged off a key German business morale indicator highlighting the deteriorating health of the euro zone.  The European tech sector hit its highest level since Nov. 12 after an overnight chipmakers’ rally on Wall Street led by higher than expected results in the sector.  The sector has been hit hard by fears about stagnating smartphone demand and a cooling Chinese economy after sales warnings from Apple, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor earlier this month. [.N] Car makers and parts suppliers, which are sensitive to trade frictions and the health of the Chinese economy, were also strong performers, up 2.3 percent.  Telecoms were among the few sectors in the red after disappointing results from Vodafone and Nordic telecom group Telia. Vodafone was down 4.9 percent, hitting its lowest in nearly nine years after the world’s second-largest mobile operator said revenue growth slowed in the third quarter due to ongoing price competition in Spain and Italy and a slowdown in South Africa.      The stock was knocked hard on Thursday after its South African unit issued disappointing results. Telia was down 4.6 percent, at the bottom of the STOXX 600 after its weaker-than-expected results.

2019-01-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May is aiming to break the parliamentary deadlock over Brexit by proposing to seek further concessions from the European Union on a plan to prevent customs checks on the Irish border. On Jan. 29, parliament will debate May’s proposed next steps as well as alternative plans put forward by MPs, including some that seek to delay Britain’s March 29 exit by requesting an extension to the two-year Article 50 negotiation period. Others seek to shift control of the process away from government and give parliament itself the chance to define Brexit. If successful, this could have a profound effect, giving MPs who want to block, delay or renegotiate Brexit a possible legal route to do so. The Jan. 29 proceedings are not a rerun of a debate earlier this month, after which parliament hugely rejected May’s deal. Instead, they are designed to discover what sort of changes would be required to win the support of parliament. If an option were approved by a majority of MPs, May could go back to the EU and seek changes to her Brexit deal. Parliament would ultimately need to vote on any revised deal. Below is what is due to happen next:             JAN. 21-29: MPS PROPOSE ALTERNATIVES MPs are proposing alternatives to May’s next steps through a parliamentary device known as an amendment. Amendments will be selected on Jan. 29 by speaker John Bercow and can then be put to a vote.  Below are the amendments that have been put forward so far: AMENDMENT A - Signed by 52 MPs Proposed by opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, it calls for parliament to consider alternative options to prevent Britain leaving without a deal, including seeking a permanent customs union with the EU and holding a second referendum. This is unlikely to be approved as pro-EU MPs in  May’s Conservative Party have indicated they will not rebel against their leader by supporting it. Several Labour MPs and the pro-EU Liberal Democrats have proposed changes to this amendment so that it would call only for parliament to vote on holding a second referendum and that remaining in the EU should be an option in that referendum. AMENDMENT B - Signed by 103 MPs Put forward by Labour lawmaker Yvette Cooper, this one has a strong chance of succeeding as Labour’s finance policy chief has said it is “highly likely” the party will back it. It is also supported by several of May’s Conservatives. It seeks to shift control of Brexit from May’s government to parliament by demanding that on Feb. 5, the rule that government business takes precedence in parliament is overturned. Providing it has the support of 10 MPs from at least four political parties, it then makes time for a piece of legislation Cooper has proposed, which gives May until Feb. 26 to get a deal approved by parliament.  If the government fails to get a deal through by that date, parliament would be given a vote on asking the EU for a postponement of the Article 50 deadline to prevent Britain leaving without a deal on March 29. It proposes a nine-month extension, to Dec. 31. AMENDMENT C - Signed by 11 MPs Proposed by Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable and his MPs, it calls on the government to rule out a no-deal exit and prepare for a second referendum in which the option to remain in the EU would be on the ballot paper. AMENDMENT D - Signed by 11 MPs Proposed by Liberal Democrat lawmaker Tom Brake, it demands that a committee of no more than 17 MPs from across political parties be created and given control of the parliamentary Brexit process. AMENDMENT E - Signed by 33 MPs Proposed by Conservative lawmaker Andrew Murrison and supported by many Conservatives, it calls for Britain’s exit deal with Brussels to be changed to add an expiry date to the Northern Irish backstop of Dec. 31, 2021. AMENDMENT F - Signed by 17 MPs This has been put forward by Labour lawmaker Hilary Benn, who chairs parliament’s Brexit select committee. It calls on the government to hold indicative votes on the following options: 1) Holding another vote in parliament on May’s deal 2) Leaving with no deal on March 29 3) Calling on the government to renegotiate May’s deal 4) Holding a second referendum AMENDMENT G - Signed by 74 MPs This has been proposed by Conservative lawmaker Dominic Grieve and has a chance of succeeding as it is supported by MPs from several parties. It demands that, one day a week in February and March, the rule that government business takes precedence in parliament is overturned, giving MPs the opportunity to propose their own debates on Brexit. Any proposals approved by parliament on those days would not be binding on the government but would be politically difficult to ignore. AMENDMENT H - Signed by 37 MPs Put forward by a group of Labour MPs, this calls on the government to request an extension to the Article 50 deadline so that a ‘Citizen’s Assembly’ of 250 people can be created to consider the way forward and make recommendations to parliament within 10 weeks of being set up. AMENDMENT I - Signed by 129 MPs Put forward by Conservative lawmaker Caroline Spelman and supported by MPs from most political parties, it seeks to rule out a no-deal Brexit. AMENDMENT J - Signed by 78 MPs Proposed by MPs from Labour, May’s Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats, this calls on the government to request an extension to the Article 50 deadline if a deal has not been approved by Feb. 26. AMENDMENT K - Signed by 17 MPs This amendment, put forward by Conservative lawmaker John Baron, calls on parliament to reject any Brexit deal which includes a Northern Ireland backstop. AMENDMENT L - Signed by 17 MPs Also proposed by Baron, it states that parliament will not approve a Brexit deal which includes a Northern Ireland backstop lasting any longer than six months. AMENDMENT M - Signed by 18 MPs Also put forward by Baron, it calls for parliament to reject any Brexit deal that does not give Britain a unilateral right to terminate the Northern Ireland backstop.     AMENDMENT N - Signed by 8 MPs Supported by Graham Brady, the chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of Conservative MPs, it calls for the  backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border and says parliament would support May’s Brexit deal if this change were made. Parliament will hold a day of debate on May’s proposed next steps and the amendments.  A vote in favour of changing the parliamentary rules would change the long-held principle of the British parliament that the government has control of what has the chance to become law.  Votes on alternative types of deal proposed by MPs should give an indication of whether there is any way forward supported by a majority in parliament.

2019-01-27,"YANGON (Reuters) - A Myanmar court on Friday rejected the appeal of two Reuters reporters sentenced to seven years in jail on charges of breaking the Official Secrets Act, saying the defence had not provided sufficient evidence to show they were innocent. Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were convicted by a lower court in September in a landmark case that has raised questions about Myanmar’s progress towards democracy and sparked an outcry from diplomats and human rights advocates. “It was a suitable punishment,” said High Court Judge Aung Naing, referring to the seven-year prison term meted out by the lower court. The defence has the option of making a further appeal to the country’s supreme court, based in the capital Naypyitaw. “Today’s ruling is yet another injustice among many inflicted upon Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo. They remain behind bars for one reason: those in power sought to silence the truth,”  Reuters Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler said in a statement. “Reporting is not a crime, and until Myanmar rights this terrible wrong, the press in Myanmar is not free, and Myanmar’s commitment to rule of law and democracy remains in doubt.” U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said in a message on Twitter that the decision was deeply troubling and showed Myanmar’s courts “failing a basic test in democracy.” “In the name of free & independent press, the gov’t of Burma should release these journalists immediately. The world is watching,” Pence added. In their appeal arguments last month, defence lawyers had cited evidence of a police set-up and lack of proof of a crime. They asserted the lower court that tried the case had wrongly placed the burden of proof on the defendants.     The defence also said prosecutors had failed to prove the reporters gathered and collected secret information, sent information to an enemy of Myanmar or that they had an intention to harm national security. Explaining his verdict, Judge Aung Naing said the reporters had behaved in a way that showed they intended to harm the country. The judge cited meetings between reporter Wa Lone and members of the security forces as well as a notebook found at the journalist’s house that contained the phone number of a member of the Arakan Army, an armed ethnic rebel group he had reported on while covering peace negotiations several years ago. Wa Lone had testified during the trial that the phone number did not work and he did not have contact with the rebel group. “Action can be taken against them if, judging by their behaviour and characteristics, it appears they will harm the national security and interests of the country,” said Aung Naing. He said the defence had failed to prove the arrests were a set-up by authorities. “I lost all my hope,” a weeping Chit Su Win, the wife of reporter Kyaw Soe Oo, said after the verdict. Britain called on Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi to look at whether due process was followed.  Asked about the case by BBC radio, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt urged Suu Kyi, a Nobel laureate, to “recognise that, as someone who fought for democracy in Burma, she should be taking a personal interest in the future of these two brave journalists.” Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay was not available for comment.   Standing outside the court building in Yangon where the judgement was pronounced, Kristian Schmidt, the European Union ambassador to Myanmar, said the ruling was a “miscarriage of justice and it gives us great concern for the independence of the justice system of Myanmar”. Defence lawyer Than Zaw Aung, speaking after the ruling, said his team would discuss the option of a supreme court appeal with the two reporters. “We are very disappointed with the judgement,” he said. Before their arrest, the reporters had been working on a Reuters investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys by security forces and Buddhist civilians in western Myanmar’s Rakhine State during an army crackdown that began in August 2017.      The operation sent more than 730,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh, according to United Nations’ estimates.

2019-01-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - Queen Elizabeth II urged Britain to seek out the common ground and grasp the big picture, a coded plea to the political class to resolve the Brexit crisis that has shocked investors and allies alike. With the clock ticking down to March 29, the date set in law for Brexit, the United Kingdom is in the deepest political crisis in half a century as it grapples with how, or even whether, to exit the European project it joined in 1973. While Elizabeth, 92, did not mention Brexit explicitly in a speech to her local Women’s Institute in Norfolk, the monarch said every generation faced “fresh challenges and opportunities.” “As we look for new answers in the modern age, I for one prefer the tried and tested recipes, like speaking well of each other and respecting different points of view; coming together to seek out the common ground; and never losing sight of the bigger picture,” the queen said. The comments were interpreted as a coded signal to Britain’s political class. The Times’ main headline read: “End Brexit feud, Queen tells warring politicians” while the BBC said there was no doubt the monarch was sending a message. As head of state, the queen remains neutral on politics in public and is unable to vote though ahead of the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, she made a delicately crafted plea for Scots to think carefully about their future.

2019-01-27,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland’s central bank warned on Friday that a no-deal Brexit could knock as much as 4 percentage points off the Irish economy’s growth rate in its first full year and by up to 6 percentage points over a decade.  The “worst-case” Brexit scenario, presented alongside the central bank’s official forecasts for 2019, would see British demand for Irish goods collapse while fresh falls in sterling weigh on the competitiveness of Irish exporters. Ireland’s economy has been the best performing in Europe since 2014, but in its latest quarterly bulletin the bank published updated analysis on the consequences for the Irish economy should Britain leave the EU on March 29 without a deal. According to the bank, a “disorderly Brexit” would have “material and immediate economic implications” that its analysis suggests could lower GDP growth in 2019 to around 1.5 percent. The economy would only escape a bigger hit this year because growth is expected to remain strong in the first three months of the year, before Britain’s scheduled departure. Over a 10-year period, the bank’s modeling suggests a no-deal Brexit could reduce the overall level of Irish output by around 6 percentage points, although again employment and growth remain positive overall.  “A disorderly ‘no-deal’ Brexit has the potential to significantly alter the path of the Irish economy in both the short- and medium-term, with a substantial and permanent loss of output,” said Mark Cassidy, the central bank’s Director of Economics and Statistics. The central bank’s official forecasts assume Britain leaves the EU with a deal as scheduled, which would include a transition period to help minimize disruption.  In that case, the central bank’s forecast is for the Irish economy to continue to grow at a relatively strong pace, expanding 4.4 percent this year, then moderating to 3.6 percent in 2020.  Unemployment is forecast to fall to 4.9 percent in 2019 and to 4.7 percent in 2020, down from 16 percent in 2012, when Ireland was midway through a three-year international bailout.

2019-01-27,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government on Thursday called for democratic new elections in Venezuela, joining forces with the United States in saying it stood with the opposition-controlled National Assembly, not Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. “With regard to #Venezuela, we are not neutral,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Twitter. “We support the National Assembly, which is elected by the people. Maduro has no democratic legitimacy as President.” The United States on Thursday requested a public U.N. Security Council meeting on Venezuela, a day after recognising opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s interim president and urging other countries to do the same.  Venezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaido declared himself interim president on Wednesday, winning support from U.S. President Donald Trump and some Latin American countries.    Maduro has responded by cutting diplomatic ties with the United States and ordering the country’s diplomats to leave. Maas told Germany’s Deutsche Welle broadcaster on Thursday: “We are on (Juan) Guaido’s side,” the media group said in a posting on Twitter. Germany, a non-permanent member of the Security Council, earlier said the National Assembly had a special role to play in securing a free future for Venezuela. “The Venezuelan people are courageously committed to a free future for the country,” government spokesman Steffen Seibert tweeted. “This requires a political process that leads to free and credible elections.

2019-01-27,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and China are “miles and miles” from resolving trade issues but there is a fair chance the two countries will get a deal, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday. A 30-member Chinese delegation plans to come to Washington next week for talks, he said, as the world’s two largest economies try to meet a March 1 deadline to resolve their trade disputes, but Ross tried to tamp down expectations for the high-level talks. “There is a very large group coming. There’s been a lot of anticipatory work done but we’re miles and miles from getting a resolution and frankly that shouldn’t be too surprising,” Ross said in an interview with CNBC.  “Trade is very complicated, there’s lots and lots of issues - not just how many soybeans and how much LNG.” More important, he said, were the structural reforms that Washington believes are needed in the Chinese economy, as well as enforcement mechanisms for failure to adhere to whatever is agreed to.    Ross said the two sides were unlikely to resolve all their disputes in next week’s talks, but added, “I think there’s a fair chance we do get to a deal.” Ross’ comments fed lingering stock market anxieties about damaging economic fallout from the U.S.-China trade fight, helping to keep the Dow Jones Industrial Average in negative territory and limit gains in other indexes.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was somewhat more upbeat on Thursday, saying that the United States and China were “making a lot of progress” in the talks, but he did not elaborate on areas where that progress could be seen. High-level talks in Washington scheduled for next week will include discussions about China’s currency practices, Mnuchin said. He has criticized the yuan’s weakness in the past, but in recent days, positive sentiment toward the talks has lifted the yuan’s value against the dollar. If a deal cannot be reached by March 2 to increase China’s protection of U.S. intellectual property, curb industrial subsidies and open Chinese markets to U.S. companies, President Donald Trump has vowed to increase tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. China has repeatedly played down complaints about intellectual property abuses, and has rejected accusations that foreign companies face forced technology transfers as a price of doing business in China. Beijing has offered instead to significantly increases purchases of U.S. soybeans, energy and other products to shrink the $375 billion annual U.S. trade deficit with China. Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and other top Trump administration officials are scheduled to meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu on Jan. 30 and 31 in Washington.  “During the upcoming high-level negotiations, both sides will continue to hold in-depth talks on various economic and trade issues of mutual concern,” Gao Feng, spokesman at the commerce ministry, told reporters. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow also made positive comments about the meetings in Washington. “I think the Liu He talks will be determinative,” Kudlow told Fox News. Kudlow told Reuters on Tuesday that Trump is “not going to back down” on U.S. demands for structural changes to Chinese IP and technology practices.  Two influential business groups this week also urged Trump to push for meaningful reforms in Beijing to address “systemic issues in the Chinese economy that result in unfair competition and non-market outcomes.” The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Chamber of Commerce in China said in a new report: “While reducing the trade deficit and purchases of U.S. exports may be one aspect of the negotiations, we urge the U.S. government to prioritize outcomes that address structural changes posed by China’s economic policies and practices.”  Ross stressed there was no deadline until March 1. “So there’s quite a little bit of time between now and then to judge just where do we stand, is it worth going forward or have we reached an impasse?” Additional Reporting by Muyu Xu and Joseph Campbell in Beijing and David Lawder and Makini Brice in Washington; Editing by Susan Thomas and James Dalgleish",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trade-china/u-s-china-miles-and-miles-from-trade-deal-ross-idUKKCN1PI0OV,2019-01-27,,"U.S., China 'miles and miles' from trade deal - Ross"
2019-01-27,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - British finance minister Philip Hammond hit back at supporters of a no-deal Brexit on Thursday, telling business leaders that leaving without a deal would break promises made in the 2016 referendum and risk fuelling populism. Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29, and last week lawmakers voted by an historic margin to block the transition deal which Prime Minister Theresa May had agreed with Brussels, putting the country on course for exit without a deal. While a no-deal Brexit is seen as tolerable or even desirable by many Brexit supporters within the Conservative Party, Hammond has long supported a softer Brexit, though rarely in such direct terms. “Not leaving would be seen as a betrayal of that referendum decision. But leaving without a deal would undermine our future prosperity, and would equally represent a betrayal of the promises that were made,” he told a Confederation of British Industry (CBI) event at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has refused to meet May to discuss Brexit until she rules out a no-deal option, and lawmakers outside government are seeking to block it. Earlier on Thursday, Airbus (AIR.PA) warned it could shift future wing-building out of Britain in the absence of a smooth exit from the EU, and predicted “potentially very harmful decisions” for its British operations in the event of no deal. Concern about a ‘backstop’ agreement for the border between the British province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland has been a major sticking point for Conservative Brexit supporters, who fear the EU will use it to extract concessions on British sovereignty after Brexit. “Ingenuity and flexibility” from the EU, as well as “a spirit of compromise” from some Conservative lawmakers would be needed on this area to reach a satisfactory agreement, Hammond said. “Failure to do so could lead to instability (and) populism,” he added, according to a text of his remarks provided by his office. British businesses are deeply concerned by the government’s refusal to rule out a no-deal Brexit which would entail lengthy delays for cross-border trade if it cannot get parliamentary support for its preferred withdrawal plan. CBI Director-General Carolyn Fairbairn warned of “another bleak day for British business” on Monday after May announced little substantive change to her Brexit plans in response to their historic defeat in parliament. On Tuesday, James Dyson, a billionaire Brexit supporter who revolutionized vacuum cleaners with his bagless technology, said he was moving his head office to Singapore from Britain to be closer to his company’s fastest-growing markets.

2019-01-27,"(Reuters) - Britain’s FTSE 100 ended lower for the third consecutive session on Thursday as weak sector earnings hurt Vodafone and Rentokil while comments from the U.S. Commerce Secretary cast doubt over the prospects for a resolution of the trade dispute with China. The FTSE 100 closed down 0.4 percent, on track for its worst weekly performance since early December, while the more domestically focused FTSE 250 edged higher by 0.2 percent. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the United States and China were “miles and miles” from resolving their trade issues, but added that there was a fair chance the two countries would strike a deal. Vodafone fell 3.5 percent to its lowest since November after its South African unit reported a slowdown in service revenue growth and was the biggest drag on the blue-chip index.  Pest control company Rentokil was also among big fallers, sliding 3.3 percent after results at U.S. peer Rollins missed Wall Street expectations. Broader sentiment continued to outweigh Brexit uncertainties. The European Parliament’s Brexit group said it would not approve a Brexit deal that did not contain a full “backstop” provision to avoid a hard Irish border. European companies have been stockpiling inventories and setting up units outside the UK ahead of Brexit. The latest jolt came from Airbus, which warned it could shift wing-building out of Britain in the absence of a smooth exit from the European Union. Despite a looming March 29 deadline, there is very little clarity on how Britain’s exit from the EU will pan out. The uncertainty was a major factor behind the European Central Bank downgrading its growth risk assessment, according to ECB President Mario Draghi. Gary Waite, portfolio manager at Walker Crips Investment Management, said that with various permutations of possible Brexit, it is “really impossible to say with any certainty what road we’re going to go down”.  Consumer goods maker Reckitt Benckiser fell 3.3 percent to a more than eight-month low as Jefferies downgraded the stock in the wake of the departure of its longstanding CEO. Outperforming the index was wealth manager St James’s Place, which climbed 2.2 percent after beating forecasts for net inflows of client cash in a tough fourth quarter for global markets. Just after noon, British Airways owner IAG jumped to session highs after it ruled out a bid for Norwegian Air and said it would sell its remaining stake in the budget airline. IAG added 0.3 percent on the day. The mid-caps were buoyed by financial stocks, led by a more than 10 percent bounce in Metro Bank and Sanne Group. Both stocks had slumped in the previous session in news-related moves.    Earnings also impacted mid-cap shares. Frankie & Benny’s owner Restaurant Group was the top faller, down 4 percent after predicting lower full-year like-for-like sales. Just Eat added 2.4 percent after a JP Morgan upgrade while homebuilder Crest Nicholson shed 2.1 percent, with a trader citing a rating downgrade. CMC Markets rose 2.8 percent as the Sino-U.S. trade tensions boosted client activity on its online trade platform in the third quarter. Shares of rivals IG Group and Plus500 also rose.  Among small-caps, NCC Group tanked 31 percent to its lowest since April 2017 after it guided to lower full-year EBIT and said sales in the UK were held back by softer demand.    AIM-listed tonic water maker Fevertree jumped 13.5 percent on its best day in more than 14 months after guiding to an almost 40 percent surge in full-year revenue.

2019-01-27,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaido declared himself interim president on Wednesday, winning backing from Washington and parts of Latin America and prompting socialist Nicolas Maduro, the country’s leader since 2013, to break relations with the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump formally recognised Guaido shortly after his announcement and praised his plan to hold elections. That was followed by similar statements from Canada and a slew of right-leaning Latin American governments, including Venezuela’s neighbours Brazil and Colombia. Lawmakers in Russia, which has invested heavily in Venezuela’s oil industry, provided support to its military, and  become a lender of last resort as the economy implodes,  denounced the declarations. Lower parliamentary house speaker Vyacheslav Volodin called the steps to remove Maduro illegal, Interfax news agency reported on Thursday. A second lawmaker, Franz Klinzevich, said Moscow could wind up its military cooperation with Venezuela if Maduro was ousted. In Ankara, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said recognising a leader other than Maduro might cause “chaos”. In Paris, a presidency official said France was consulting with its European partners about the situation. At a rally on Wednesday in the east of the capital Caracas that drew hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans, Guaido accused Maduro of usurping power. He promised to create a transitional government that would help the oil-rich nation escape its hyperinflationary economic collapse. “I swear to assume all the powers of the presidency to secure an end to the usurpation,” 35-year old Guaido, the head of the opposition-run congress, told an exuberant crowd. Guaido’s declaration takes Venezuela into uncharted territory, with the possibility of the opposition now running a parallel government recognised abroad as legitimate but without control over state functions. In a televised broadcast from the presidential palace, Maduro accused the opposition of seeking to stage a coup with Washington’s support. “We’ve had enough interventionism, here we have dignity, damn it! Here is a people willing to defend this land,” said Maduro, flanked by Socialist Party leaders.  Any change of government will rest on a shift in allegiance within the armed forces. So far, they have stood by Maduro through two waves of street protests and a steady dismantling of democratic institutions.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on the Venezuelan military to protect “the welfare and well-being of all Venezuelan citizens,” and said Washington would take “appropriate actions” against anyone who endangered the safety of U.S. personnel. The United States would conduct its diplomatic relations with Venezuela through “the government of interim President Guaido,” he said. Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said on Wednesday that the armed forces did not recognise a self-proclaimed president “imposed by shadowy interests ... outside the law.” Military top brass indicated their continued support for Maduro in tweets. In a potent symbol of Venezuelan anger, demonstrators in the southern city of Puerto Ordaz on Tuesday toppled a statue of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez. They broke the statue in half and dangled part of it from a bridge. Maduro took power in 2013 after his mentor Chavez died. As the oil price sank and revenues dried up, the social welfare programs designed by Chavez faltered. Venezuela spiralled into its worst-ever economic crisis, with hyperinflation forecast to reach 10 million percent this year. But Maduro nevertheless started a second term on Jan. 10, following a widely-boycotted election last year that many foreign governments described as a sham. In the Chacao district of eastern Caracas, a traditional opposition bastion, a dozen protesters spoke of a renewed confidence in dislodging Maduro and predicted a new wave of demonstrations.  “The struggle will be long,” said Ciro Cirino on Altamira plaza, minutes after police on motorbikes charged a crowd of several thousand protesters, firing tear gas to disperse them. “The police push us back... and we keep going back. We are going to be here until there is a change,” said Cirino, a 35-year-old computer programmer. “We’re hungry. Look how skinny I am: there’s no food in my house,” said another protester holding a petrol bomb, who declined to give his name “We have to get rid of Maduro.” Some 3 million Venezuelans have fled abroad over the past five years to escape widespread shortages of food and medicine. Eight people have so far died across Venezuela in clashes with police this week, according to local officials and rights groups.  Venezuela’s constitution says if the presidency is determined to be vacant, new elections should be called in 30 days and that the head of the congress should assume the presidency in the meantime. However, the pro-government Supreme Court has ruled that all actions taken by the National Assembly congress are null and void and the government has jailed dozens of opposition leaders and activists for seeking to overthrow Maduro through violent street demonstrations in 2014 and 2017. As pressure mounts on Maduro both internally and externally, the Trump administration is considering sanctions on Venezuelan oil as soon as this week, according to sources.  The South American OPEC country has the largest crude reserves in the world and is a major supplier to U.S. refiners, though output is hovering near 70-year lows and reaction in the oil markets was muted on Wednesday. Local bonds rebounded, with Venezuela’s benchmark 2027 bond trading above 31 cents on the dollar for the first time since May 2018.

2019-01-27,"FRANKFURT, (Reuters) - The European Central Bank left its policy stance unchanged as expected on Thursday, keeping a rate hike later this year on the table even as the euro zone economy suffers its biggest slowdown in half a decade. Following are highlights of ECB President Mario Draghi’s comments at a press conference after the bank’s policy meeting. “Significant monetary policy stimulus remains essential to support the further buildup of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term.  “This will be provided by our forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizable stock of acquired assets.” “The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim in a sustained manner.” “We intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary.” “Supportive financing conditions, favourable labour market dynamics and rising wage growth continue to underpin the euro area expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures.”  “This supports our confidence in the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to 2 percent over the medium term.” “The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to the geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility.” “The persistence of uncertainties, in particular relating to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism, is weighing on economic sentiment.” “The incoming information has continued to be weaker than expected on account of softer external demand and some country and sector-specific factors.”  EMEA News Desk",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ecb-policy-highlights/draghi-comments-at-ecb-press-conference-idUKKCN1PI1SV,2019-01-27,,Draghi comments at ECB press conference
2019-01-27,"(Reuters) - Following is the statement from the European Central Bank following its policy meeting. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we intend to continue re-investing, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. The incoming information has continued to be weaker than expected on account of softer external demand and some country- and sector-specific factors. The persistence of uncertainties in particular relating to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism is weighing on economic sentiment. At the same time, supportive financing conditions, favourable labour market dynamics and rising wage growth continue to underpin the euro area expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures. This supports our confidence in the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2 percent  over the medium term. Significant monetary policy stimulus remains essential to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. This will be provided by our forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforced by the re-investments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets. In any event, the Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim in a sustained manner. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.2 percent, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2018, following growth of 0.4 percent in the previous two quarters. Incoming data have continued to be weaker than expected as a result of a slowdown in external demand compounded by some country and sector-specific factors. While the impact of some of these factors is expected to fade, the near-term growth momentum is likely to be weaker than previously anticipated. Looking ahead, the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains and rising wages, lower energy prices, and the ongoing – albeit somewhat slower – expansion in global activity. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility. Euro area annual HICP inflation declined to 1.6 percent in December 2018, from 1.9 percent in November, reflecting mainly lower energy price inflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline further over the coming months. Measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, but labour cost pressures are continuing to strengthen and broaden amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to increase over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth moderated to 3.7 percent in November 2018, after 3.9 percent in October. M3 growth continues to be backed by bank credit creation. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 4.0 percent in November 2018, after 3.9 percent in October, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained broadly unchanged at 3.3 percent. The euro area bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2018 suggests that overall bank lending conditions remained favourable, following an extended period of net easing, and demand for bank credit continued to rise, thereby underpinning loan growth. The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing – in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises – and credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential. Regarding fiscal policies, the Governing Council reiterates the need for rebuilding fiscal buffers. This is particularly important in countries where government debt is high and for which full adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact is critical for safeguarding sound fiscal positions. Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the EU’s fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union.

2019-01-27,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland is prepared for a 12-fold increase in the number of import and export declarations made by local companies after Brexit, the head of the state agency responsible for customs checks said on Tuesday. With close trading links to its nearest neighbour, Ireland’s export-focused economy is considered the most vulnerable among remaining European Union members to the impact of Britain’s departure from the bloc. The number of firms dealing with customs could surge to as many as 100,000 from 17,000 last year, requiring 20 million annual declarations, if Britain is no longer a member of the EU’s customs union, the chairman of Ireland’s Office of the Revenue Commissioners said. “It will present a significant challenge for many of those businesses who do not have any experience of third country trade and what it entails,” Niall Cody told a parliamentary committee, adding the agency will have 400 additional staff in place by the end of March to deal with the workload. It had initially hoped to phase in the 600 new staff that will ultimately be required by the end of 2020, on the assumption that there would be a transition period, but sped up the recruitment as the risk of a no-deal Brexit increased. Cody said the tax authority was not planning for the return of customs posts to the border between EU-member Ireland and Northern Ireland, which will be the United Kingdom’s only land frontier with the bloc after its departure. The question of how to keep the seamless border open after Brexit is proving a major hurdle in ratifying the EU divorce deal in London and the Irish government insists it will not countenance making contingency plans for the return of a hard border if no deal can be agreed. Police on both sides of the border have warned that customs posts could be a target for the small number of militant groups still active in Northern Ireland after a 1998 peace deal ended three decades of violence in the province. “The government has made clear that its overriding objective is to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. Revenue is not planning for customs posts on the land border,” Cody said, adding no preparatory work was being carried out along the 500-km (300-mile) frontier. He said, however, there would have to be some form of declaration process requiring “significant change”, when asked about the impact of a no-deal Brexit in relation to cross border trade. “I couldn’t come in here and rule out something forever,” Cody said, when pressed if he could rule out checks, whatever the outcome of Brexit. “There are certain key principles that flow from being a member of the customs union.”  Editing by Janet Lawrence",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-ireland-customs/ireland-braced-for-12-fold-rise-in-customs-declarations-post-brexit-idUKKCN1PI1GU,2019-01-27,,Ireland braced for 12-fold rise in customs declarations post-Brexit

2019-01-27,"(Reuters) - British pub operator JD Wetherspoon Plc (JDW.L) said it enjoyed strong sales over the Christmas period, helped by Britons’ new-found fondness for gin and solid demand for coffee drinks. The company, which warned in November about weaker sales, said it still expects pretax profit for the first half of its fiscal year to be lower than a year earlier as it struggles with higher costs, but it maintained its full-year outlook. Wetherspoon follows other UK pub operators, including Greene King Plc (GNK.L), Marston’s Plc (MARS.L) and Stonegate Pub Company IPO-SPC.L, owner of the Slug and Lettuce pub chain, that have reported higher sales for the period, even as they face cost pressures and slowing consumer spending in Britain amid uncertainty about Brexit. Wetherspoon said like-for-like sales for the 12 weeks to Jan. 20 rose by 7.2 percent from a year earlier.  Its shares rose as much as 4 percent, but quickly gave up gains to trade down 0.7 percent by 1004 GMT as analysts said Weatherspoon’s trading update was mixed. “Our expectations for the full year are unchanged,” the company said in a statement but gave no details. British pub operators have been battling rising costs from an increase in the minimum wage, higher property rents and a Brexit-spurred slide in sterling. At the same time, younger Britons are increasingly moving away from pub drinking. “It has been a strong trading period with gin sales which are very fashionable at the moment, with pink gin ... there has been a good sales of craft beer as well and very good sales of coffee,” Wetherspoon’s pro-Brexit Chief Executive Office Tim Martin told Reuters. FTSE 250 .FTMC group Wetherspoon, which relies heavily on alcohol sales at its restaurants, also serves items such as low-calorie breakfast options, English muffins, pancakes and Lavazza filter coffee to boost revenue through a diversified portfolio. The company is investing in its food and coffee business, which is more labour intensive than beer. “Costs, as previously indicated, are considerably higher than the previous year, especially labour, which has increased by about 30 million pounds in the period,” Martin said. In November JD Wetherspoon announced a pay increase for its employees, while it is also dealing with a new sugar tax on drinks. “While top line continues to be strong, operating margins also continue to come under pressure and at 7.7 percent are the lowest in the sector,” said Liberum analyst Anna Barnfather, who has a “hold” rating on the stock.  Weatherspoon said it plans to open 5 to 10 pubs in the current financial year, which ends in July, after opening six outlets in its previous fiscal year.

2019-01-27,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would hold an alternative event to the State of the Union address after Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi barred him from speaking in the House of Representatives until the partial government shutdown ends. The clash between two of Washington’s most powerful leaders escalated the standoff that has partly closed the government for 33 days and that threatens the U.S. economy and the livelihoods of about 800,000 federal workers. On Speaker Pelosi’s move to lock him out of the House, Trump said at a White House meeting on border security, “It’s a disgrace.” Pelosi told the president that for now she would not consider a measure authorizing the speech, an annual, televised rite in American politics traditionally delivered in the House chamber. “Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened,” Pelosi said to Trump in a letter. Earlier in the day, Trump essentially dared her to disinvite him from making the speech, which was set for next Tuesday.     Several House Democrats said Pelosi did the right thing.  “He’s an uninvited guest. This chamber doesn’t belong to him. We have a separation of powers here,” said Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland. “We make the laws here, and his job is to make sure the laws are faithfully executed. He hasn’t done that, and he’s not invited.” The State of the Union speech, used by presidents to announce their policy goals for the year, has become a hostage to the showdown between Trump and congressional Democrats over his demand for funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. About a quarter of the government has been shut down since Dec. 22 when some U.S. agencies’ funding expired for reasons unrelated to border security or immigration. Trump at first expressed support for legislation to restore the agencies’ funding. Then he demanded that any shutdown-ending measure must contain $5.7 billion for the border wall, funding that Democrats oppose. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump promised that Mexico would pay for his wall, but Mexico refused and now the Republican president wants U.S. taxpayers to pay for it. House Democrats have approved several measures to fully reopen the government, but none has won approval in the Senate, which is controlled by the Republicans. Test votes on related measures were scheduled for Thursday in the Senate. Pelosi suggested on Jan. 16 that Trump postpone the State of the Union speech because of the closure.  She cited concerns about security for the event. Earlier on Wednesday, Trump tried to brush aside Pelosi’s concerns and said he planned to deliver the address before the U.S. Congress as scheduled next Tuesday. “It would be so very sad for our Country if the State of the Union were not delivered on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location!” Trump wrote to Pelosi. The president is required to give Congress a report on the nation, but is not required to deliver it in a live, televised address before lawmakers. Many past presidents have delivered it in writing.

May’s deal was roundly rejected by parliament last week and Barclay said further talks needed to be held with the EU once there was clarity on what MPs might be willing to support. “If we were to find that we can’t secure a deal, then the House (of Commons) in essence has a question: does it have a no deal or does it revoke,” he told a committee of members of the upper house of parliament, the House of Lords. Asked if the government was running down the clock to the March 29 exit day to pressure MPs into backing May’s deal, Barclay said it was not in the government’s interests to do so as time would be needed to prepare for a no-deal exit.

2019-01-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May is seeking to break the parliamentary deadlock over Brexit by proposing to seek further concessions from the European Union on a plan to prevent customs checks on the Irish border. On Jan. 29, parliament will debate May’s proposed next steps as well as alternative plans put forward by MPs, including some that seek to delay Britain’s March 29 exit by requesting an extension to the two-year Article 50 negotiation period. Some also seek to shift control of the process away from government and give parliament the chance to define Brexit. If successful, this could have a profound effect, giving MPs who want to block, delay or renegotiate Brexit a possible legal route to do so.  Below is what is due to happen next:             JAN. 21-29: MPS PROPOSE ALTERNATIVES MPs have begun proposing alternatives to May’s next steps through a parliamentary device known as an amendment. Amendments will be selected on Jan. 29 by speaker John Bercow and can then be put to a vote.  Below are the amendments that have been put forward so far: Proposed by opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, it calls for parliament to consider alternative options to prevent Britain leaving without a deal, including seeking a permanent customs union with the EU and holding a second referendum. This is unlikely to be approved as pro-EU Conservative lawmakers have indicated they will not support it. The pro-EU Liberal Democrats have proposed a change to this amendment so that it would call only for parliament to vote on holding a second referendum and that remaining in the EU should be an option in that referendum. Put forward by a group of Labour MPs, this calls on the government to request an extension to the Article 50 deadline so that a ‘Citizen’s Assembly’ of 250 people can be created to consider the way forward and make recommendations to parliament within 10 weeks of being set up. This has been put forward by Labour lawmaker Hilary Benn, who chairs parliament’s Brexit select committee. It calls on the government to hold indicative votes on the following options: 1) Holding another vote in parliament on May’s deal 2) Leaving with no deal on March 29 3) Calling on the government to renegotiate May’s deal 4) Holding a second referendum Proposed by MPs from Labour, May’s Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats, this calls on the government to request an extension to the Article 50 deadline. Put forward by Labour lawmaker Yvette Cooper, it has a strong chance of succeeding as Labour’s finance policy chief has said it is “highly likely” the party will back it and it is also supported by several of May’s Conservative MPs. It seeks to shift control of Brexit from May’s government to parliament by demanding that on Feb. 5, the rule that government business takes precedence in parliament is overturned. Providing it has the support of 10 MPs, from at least four political parties, it then makes time for a piece of legislation Cooper has proposed, which gives May until Feb. 26 to get a deal approved by parliament.  If the government fails to get a deal through by that date, parliament would be given a vote on asking the EU for a postponement of the Article 50 deadline to prevent Britain leaving without a deal on March 29. It proposes a nine-month extension, to Dec. 31. This has been proposed by Conservative lawmaker Dominic Grieve and has a chance of succeeding as it is supported by MPs from several parties. It demands that, one day a week in February and March, the rule that government business takes precedence in parliament is overturned, giving MPs the opportunity to propose their own debates on Brexit. Proposed by an independent lawmaker and a member of May’s Conservatives, this amendment calls for parliament to be given votes on a range of Brexit options including leaving without a deal, extending Article 50, leaving with a Canada-style or Norway-style relationship and holding another referendum. Put forward by Labour and Conservative MPs, it seeks to rule out a ‘no deal’ Brexit. Proposed by Conservative lawmaker Andrew Murrison, it calls for Britain’s exit deal with Brussels to be changed to add an expiry date to the Northern Irish backstop of Dec. 31, 2021. Parliament will hold a day of debate on May’s proposed next steps and MPs’ amendments. They will not be asked to vote to approve a revised Brexit deal at this stage. A vote in favour of changing the parliamentary rules would change the long-held principle of the British parliament that the government has control of what has the chance to become law.  Votes on alternative types of deal proposed by MPs should give an indication of whether there is any way forward supported by a majority in parliament. If an option were approved by a majority of MPs, May could go back to the EU and seek changes to her Brexit deal. Parliament would ultimately still need to vote on any revised deal.

2019-01-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - Santander on Wednesday announced plans to shut almost a fifth of its branch network in Britain, expected to result in around 840 job losses. The Madrid-based bank’s UK business said it would close 140 branches across the country, leaving it with 614. The closure program will lead to around 840 redundancies, with the bank expecting to be able to redeploy only a third of the 1,270 staff affected. Santander said it had consulted with trade unions on the proposed changes and would try to find alternative roles for staff where possible. Santander’s action marks the latest round of major branch closures by British high street banks. Britain has lost nearly two-thirds of its bank and building society branches over the past 30 years, according to research by consumer campaign group Which? published in November. The number of branches at that time stood at 7,586, down from 20,583 in 1988. Santander said it was making the changes in response to the rapid uptake of digital banking. It said the number of transactions carried out in branches had fallen by 23 percent over the past three years. It will invest 55 million pounds in refurbishing around 100 of the remaining branches.   Linda Rolph, general secretary of the Advance union, which represents Santander workers, told Reuters: “It is a sad day for the branch staff affected. We will do everything we can to find jobs for people who want them.”  Rolph said the union was not resisting the changes: “Santander was one of the last to move to cut branches. We’re not opposing because the rationale is clear. Staff thought it was a matter of time before some branches closed.” Susan Allen, head of retail and business banking, said:    “The way our customers are choosing to bank with us has changed dramatically in recent years, with more and more customers using online and mobile channels.  “As a result, we have had to take some very difficult decisions over our less visited branches, and those where we have other branches in close proximity.” Reporting by Iain Withers, Editing by Lawrence White and Jane Merriman",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-santander/santander-plans-to-axe-a-fifth-of-its-uk-branch-network-idUKKCN1PH0Z6,2019-01-27,,Santander plans to axe a fifth of its UK branch network
2019-01-27,"(Reuters) - Fulham boss Claudio Ranieri described Cardiff City forward Emiliano Sala as a “fighter” and said he was “devastated” to hear that he was on board a flight that disappeared over the English Channel on Monday. Sala, who had completed a 17 million euros (£14.9 million) transfer from Ligue 1 side Nantes to Cardiff, was flying to the Welsh capital when the aircraft lost radar contact near the island of Guernsey. The 28-year-old Argentine forward played under Ranieri at Nantes last season and finished the campaign as the club’s top scorer with 12 goals. “Emiliano is a wonderful character,” Ranieri told Fulham’s website. “He’s a fantastic footballer who always gave his best when we worked together in France. “Knowing him as a person, he’s a fighter.” AS Monaco manager Thierry Henry posted a message on Twitter, saying: “Devastating news about Emiliano Sala. Wishing and praying for strength, courage and some good news for his family and friends.” West Ham United’s Argentine defender Pablo Zabaleta said on Twitter he was hoping for positive news: “All my thoughts with the player, pilot, their families and @CardiffCityFC.” Reporting by Rohith Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-sala-crash-reaction/ranieri-devastated-by-salas-disappearance-idUKKCN1PH08C,2019-01-27,"Fulham boss Claudio Ranieri described Cardiff City forward Emiliano Sala as a ""fighter"" and said he was ""devastated"" to hear that he was on board a flight that disappeared over the English Channel on Monday.",Ranieri devastated by Sala's disappearance
2019-01-27,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate shifted slightly closer on Tuesday to resolving a month-long partial government shutdown, but there was no sign of relief anytime soon for 800,000 federal workers who are furloughed or working without pay. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell laid the groundwork for a vote on Thursday on a Democratic proposal to fund the government for three weeks, without attaching the $5.7 billion in U.S.-Mexico border wall funding demanded by President Donald Trump. The president has opposed similar legislation in the House of Representatives. McConnell had said previously he would not consider a funding bill that Trump would refuse to sign. The Senate leader said he would also bring up for a Thursday vote a proposal by Trump to end the shutdown that includes border wall funding and relief for “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to the United States as children. The plan was unlikely to pass in the Senate and had even less chance in the Democratic-led House of Representatives. Democrats have said they would not trade a temporary restoration of the immigrants’ protections from deportation in return for a permanent border wall they view as ineffective. In 2017, Trump moved to end the Dreamers’ protections, triggering a court battle.     But the Senate action could set the stage for the type of bipartisan negotiating that will be necessary to end a shutdown that began on Dec. 22. Americans have largely blamed Trump for the shutdown, now the longest in U.S. history. Affected federal workers are struggling to make ends meet. A Trump administration official said on Tuesday the president still intended to deliver his State of the Union speech on Jan. 29, even though House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top U.S. Democrat, had recommended he delay it because of the shutdown. The request seemed likely to set up another clash between Trump and Pelosi, days after Trump abruptly refused to let her use a U.S. military plane to go on an overseas trip hours before she was to depart. Aides to Pelosi did not respond to requests for comment on whether Trump’s invitation to speak would stand. Trump may have lost the Dreamer issue as his main negotiating point on Tuesday when the U.S. Supreme Court was silent, at least for now, on considering an administration appeal of lower-court rulings allowing continued temporary protections for the immigrant youths. Instead, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program established by then-President Barack Obama in 2012 lives on with or without approval by Congress. As the Senate debates Trump’s proposal, House Democrats this week are pushing legislation that would end the partial shutdown of agencies including the departments of Justice, Homeland Security, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor and Interior. While their legislation would contain new border security money, there would be nothing for a wall, ensuring Trump’s opposition. Once the government reopens, Democrats said, they would negotiate with Trump on further border security ideas. “We were optimistic that he might ... open up government so we could have this discussion,” Pelosi told reporters in comments carried by CNN. “But then we heard what the particulars were in it and it was a non-starter, unfortunately.” Representative Jim Clyburn, the No. 3 House Democrat, welcomed any effort by the Republican-led Senate to debate and vote on legislation to reopen the government. “This gets us started,” Clyburn told MSNBC in an interview. The shutdown’s impact was being felt at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with the FBI Agents Association saying probes of possible financial crimes, drugs and terrorism were being hindered by a lack of funds. Many federal employees and contractors were turning to unemployment assistance, food banks and other support as the shutdown entered its second month. Others began seeking new jobs.

2019-01-27,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google disclosed in a quarterly filing on Tuesday that it spent a company-record $21.2 million on lobbying the U.S. government in 2018, topping its previous high of $18.22 million in 2012, as the search engine operator fights wide-ranging scrutiny into its practices. In its filing to Congress on Tuesday, Facebook Inc (FB.O) disclosed that it also spent more on government lobbying in 2018 than it ever had before at $12.62 million. That was up from $11.51 million a year ago, according to tracking by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Google’s spent $18.04 million on lobbying in 2017, according to the centre’s data. Google and Facebook declined to comment beyond their filings. U.S. lawmakers and regulators have weighed new privacy and antitrust rules to rein in the power of large internet service providers such as Google, Facebook and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Regulatory backlash in the United States, as well as Europe and Asia, is near the top of the list of concerns for technology investors, according to financial analysts.  Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) spent $9.52 million on lobbying in 2018, according to its disclosure on Tuesday, up from $8.5 million in 2017 but below its $10.5 million tab in 2013. Apple Inc (AAPL.O) spent $6.62 million last year, compared to its record of $7.15 million in 2017, according to centre data going back to 1998.  Apple and Microsoft did not respond to requests to comment. A filing from Amazon was expected later on Tuesday. Google disclosed that new discussion topics with regulators in the fourth quarter included its search technology, criminal justice reform and international tax reform. The company is perennially among the top spenders on lobbying in Washington along with a few cable operators, defence contractors and healthcare firms. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai, who testified in December before a U.S. House of Representatives panel for the first time, has said the company backs the idea of national privacy legislation. But he has contested accusations of the company having a political bias in its search results and of  stifling competition. Susan Molinari, Google’s top U.S. public policy official, stepped down to take on an advisory role this month.  Facebook said discussing “election integrity” with national security officials was among its new lobbying areas in the fourth quarter. The filing said the company continued to lobby the Federal Trade Commission, which is investigating its data security practices.

2019-01-27,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Parliament expects to start next week its procedure to endorse the Brexit deal negotiated between the bloc and London, lawmakers said on Tuesday, despite the fact that Britain is still struggling to finalise the divorce agreement. Britain’s Labour opposition party on Tuesday edged towards a new Brexit referendum as the deadlocked UK parliament looks for ways forward, keeping the EU waiting for what sort of majority could emerge. They EU has told Britain it awaits its proposals but that the already negotiated - and voted down in the House of Commons - legal withdrawal agreement was the best Britain could get.  It has stressed, however, that it could work further on an accompanying text laying out future ties for Britain and the EU should London opt for a closer relationship.  “Hopefully, at the end of January we will start our procedure,” lawmaker Danuta Hubner said on Tuesday of the parliamentary consent necessary for the deal to take effect. She expected the Brexit deal to be referred to the European Parliament next Wednesday-Thursday so the lawmakers can finalise their ratification by the Brexit date of March 29. The parliament’s Brexit pointman, Guy Verhofstadt, told the same session on Tuesday that starting the process would send an important signal.  “This means there is no renegotiation possible for us of the Withdrawal Agreement. If there is renegotiation possible, it’s only the Political Declaration in which we have nothing against a more deep future relationship between the EU and the UK,” he said.  With time running short, the bloc is stepping up preparations for a no-deal Brexit and the two sides said they expected the parliament to receive corresponding files from the bloc’s executive European Commission in mid-February. “The problem seems to be for the moment in the UK that apparently there are only negative majorities in the House of Commons,” Verhofstadt said. “No positive majorities for alternatives at this stage. Prolonging Article 50 without having a clear plan for a way out to break the deadlock based on a majority in the House of Commons seems to me very difficult to do,” he said of the EU treaty regulating Britain’s departure.  Should Brexit be delayed beyond the end of June, Britain is under legal obligations to hold May elections to pick representatives to the new European Parliament, which is due to form from July.  “Whatever the solution with Brexit, this does not prevent the parliament from regularly constituting itself when the time comes and starting its functioning,” Hubner said. In the ensuing debate, lawmakers called for more strategic thinking on the EU side and flexibility to try every avenue to keep close ties with Britain.  Others, however, said Brexit should not be delayed just because of political infighting in Britain, the country should be out in two months and the EU free to get on with its own agenda.

2019-01-27,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Scots with a taste for traditional meat pies or haggis face “enforced vegetarianism” after Brexit, a Scottish government minister warned on Tuesday, as it may starve abattoirs of a vital European workforce. In Brussels to press Scotland’s case for continued membership of the European single market, Constitutional Relations Minister Michael Russell said the British government’s plan to end free movement for EU workers would sound a “death knell” for the Scottish economy. Noting that over 60 percent of workers in Scottish slaughterhouses and 98 percent of their vets come from other EU countries, he concluded: “Enforced vegetarianism is the outcome there, because there just won’t be legal means of slaughter.” Scots around the world are this week toasting their national poet Robert Burns with carnivorous feasts of steaming haggis: sheep’s stomach stuffed with offal, oats and pepper. Russell told reporters the independence-minded devolved government in Edinburgh was expanding permanent missions in Brussels, Berlin, Paris and other European centres to help keep close to trading partners. From world-leading university research teams to fruit farms, a loss of EU nationals would be damaging and Scotland would struggle to cope with its ageing population, he said. Representing a nation that voted heavily to remain in the EU in the 2016 British referendum, the Scottish government is backing efforts in the London parliament to stop Prime Minister Theresa May taking Britain out of the bloc on March 29 without a deal to smooth the process and keep close free trade ties. Russell said the Scottish National Party, in power in Scotland and the third largest in the British legislature, said May should delay withdrawal and hold a new referendum giving voters a choice between staying in the EU or leaving on terms she negotiated last month but which parliament has rejected. After seeing preparations at the Belgian port of Zeebrugge for new controls on imports from Britain in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Russell said Scottish firms were preparing but such an outcome would be very disruptive. The possibility of Britain simply keeping its ports and borders open after a hard Brexit was “an open invitation to smuggling and to illegality”, he said.  “I ... don’t believe that can last a week.” Reporting by Alastair Macdonald; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-scotland/haggis-out-scots-fear-brexit-means-going-veggie-idUKKCN1PG20Q,2019-01-27,,Haggis out?

2019-01-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - British ferry and shipping freight operator P&O will shift the registration of its UK vessels to Cyprus ahead of Britain’s departure from the European Union, in part to keep its tax arrangements in the bloc, the company said on Tuesday. P&O currently has six UK-registered ships operating on the English Channel route to France, although it announced last month it was moving two of those to the Cyprus registry and one has already been transferred. All commercial ships have to be registered, or flagged, with a country partly to comply with safety and environmental regulations.  The move could complicate any attempts by the UK government to secure extra space on ships to help cope with potential disruption to trade if it fails to secure a negotiated departure from the EU.  “In advance of Britain leaving the European Union on March 29, 2019, we undertook a review of the flag status of our ships on the English Channel,” a P&O spokesman said in a statement. “For operational and accounting reasons, we have concluded that the best course of action is to re-flag all ships to be under the Cyprus flag.” The spokesman said Cyprus was among the world’s leading flag registries, “resulting in fewer inspections and delays”. He added the move “will result in significantly more favourable tonnage tax arrangements as the ships will be flagged in an EU member state”.  “We have no plans to make any other changes, including the terms and conditions of any of our seafarers, as a result of the new arrangements.” Such a taxation system like the EU’s allows shipping companies to pay corporation tax based on the tonnage of their vessels rather than on profit.  Industry sources told Reuters in December that the UK government had made approaches to companies including P&O, to secure back-up vessels in case Britain failed to secure a negotiated withdrawal from the EU.  Since then, Britain has awarded contracts worth more than 100 million pounds in total to three shipping firms to provide extra ferries, comprising French firm Brittany Ferries, Denmark’s DFDS and a new British company Seaborne Freight. The government has faced criticism from opposition politicians over awarding a contract to Seaborne Freight, which they said had no ships and highlighted the rush to secure ships to avoid disruptions at major ports. When asked on Tuesday if P&O could provide space on ships if needed by the government, the company declined to comment.

2019-01-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has opened a second investigation into how accounting firm KPMG audited the books of collapsed UK construction company Carillion, the watchdog said on Tuesday. The FRC said that KPMG, one of the world’s “Big Four” accounting firms, “self reported” additional material related to Carillion’s audit for year-end 2016. The audit for that year was one of 160 company audits in the FRC’s routine annual quality review. KPMG said on Tuesday it was reviewing its response to the FRC’s quality review of Carillion’s 2016 audit after concerns were identified in connection with a small number of documents provided to the FRC. “On discovery of this information, we immediately reported our findings to the FRC,” KPMG said. The accounting firm said it stood by its “conclusions” for Carillion’s audit for that year and it has reached no conclusion regarding individual responsibility. KPMG has engaged outside counsel to investigate the circumstances of the quality review and the conduct of individuals involved. The watchdog said last year that it was investigating KPMG’s audits of Carillion for 2014-2017 and the conduct of two former finance directors, Richard Adam and Zafar Khan. The second investigation was opened in November and made public on Tuesday. “The FRC continues to progress its original investigations in relation to the collapse of Carillion in conjunction with other regulators,” the watchdog said in a statement. “A key area of focus has been the financial performance of Carillion’s major contracts in both the construction and services divisions, and whether Carillion management and its auditors ensured that this was appropriately reported in its financial statements.” “The investigations are also considering conduct relating to pension liabilities, goodwill, cash disclosures and going concern,” the FRC said. A second investigation piles more pressure on KPMG in a sector that is already in the political spotlight. Carillion’s collapse angered lawmakers who called on the Competition and Markets Authority to consider breaking up the “Big Four” accountants to increase competition and audit quality. It also raised questions about the FRC’s ability to police accounting firms quickly and effectively. Last month two government-sponsored reports recommended replacing the FRC with a new watchdog, and forcing large, listed companies in Britain to hire two auditors. The FRC said it was committed to completing its investigations promptly and thoroughly.

2019-01-27,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Justice Minister Katarina Barley said on Tuesday she was disappointed by British Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan to break a deadlock over Brexit and suggested Britain hold a second referendum. May on Monday sought to break the parliamentary impasse over Britain’s exit from the European Union by proposing to seek further concessions from the EU on a plan to prevent customs checks on the Irish border. “Yes, I’m disappointed ... that’s not the way forward,” Barley told Deutschlandfunk radio. She said May had missed an opportunity to drum up support for the Brexit deal agreed with the EU. Barley, who has both German and British citizenship, said the draft deal would not be changed. But she added there could be leeway in terms of time if there was a second referendum. “This could pacify the situation,” she said. Michael Roth, German minister for European affairs, also expressed his disappointment with May’s speech, saying on Twitter: “Where is the plan B? Just asking for a friend...” A German government spokesman said late on Monday that Germany continued to advocate for an orderly exit and that it expected the British government to agree soon on proposals that are backed by a majority of parliament.

2019-01-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England was asked to consider moving the gold bars out of its vaults so that space could be rented to a pub, during its first hearing before a parliament spending watchdog. Members of parliament’s Public Accounts Committee had seized on a report by government auditors, which criticised the BoE for having more than 800 empty desks at its historic Threadneedle Street home in London’s main financial district. “If you’re making it easier for staff to work ... at home, would there be any thought to renting out aspects of Threadneedle? Would we see a Wetherspoon’s?” committee chair Meg Hillier asked, referring to the popular chain of pubs (JDW.L) known for refurbishing abandoned high street premises such as banks. But Bradley Fried, the chair of the BoE’s Court of Directors, pointed out a hitch in Hillier’s plan. “Threadneedle Street is a little bit unique, in that we are sitting on top of what is literally 140 billion pounds worth of physical gold, actual physical gold,” he said. A pub or other commercial tenant would create a security risk, he added. Undeterred, Hillier suggested moving the gold from its high-security vaults to a cheaper location, “to maximise income from Threadneedle Street”. Fried, a former chief executive of Investec Bank, said the BoE was taking the more cost-effective approach of moving some staff at another nearby office to Threadneedle Street, which might allow the other building to be partly leased out instead.

Poland’s Jacek Czaputowicz said earlier on Monday he had proposed limiting the backstop - an insurance policy to avoid the return of a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland - to five years in order to break the Brexit deadlock. The idea was immediately knocked back by Ireland as being out of step with the EU’s stance. “I look forward to exploring in more detail the proposals that have been put forward by the Polish foreign minister on this particular issue of dealing with the backstop,” May told parliament when asked about the comments.

2019-01-27,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Ousted Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn has offered to wear an electronic ankle tag and hire guards to monitor him in an unusual bid to secure his release on bail after two months of detention in Japan for alleged financial crimes. Ghosn is also willing to remain in Tokyo, where he has leased an apartment, and post stock he owns in Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) as collateral, his spokeswoman said. A new bail hearing is set for Monday after an earlier request was denied due partly to concerns he posed a flight risk. The Tokyo District Court will likely decide whether to grant Ghosn release on bail as soon as Tuesday, Japanese public broadcaster NHK said.  His release would allow Ghosn to meet more frequently with his lawyers and defend himself before the board of Renault, which is also moving to replace him as its chairman and CEO. The Renault nominations committee has tentatively backed Michelin (MICP.PA) boss Jean-Dominique Senard to become Renault chairman, as widely expected, while Ghosn’s deputy Thierry Bollore would take the full CEO role, two sources told Reuters. The planned appointments, which have yet to be put to the full Renault board, were reported earlier on Monday by Le Figaro newspaper. A Renault spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. The board of Renault, which dominates the partnership through its 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, is expected to meet within days to consider potential candidates to replace Ghosn. As Ghosn’s Nov. 19 arrest continued to cloud the outlook for Nissan’s (7201.T) three-way alliance with France’s Renault SA (RENA.PA) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (7211.T), Nissan said it was not the time to discuss revising the partners’ capital ties. Ghosn, who spearheaded Nissan’s turnaround two decades ago, had pushed for a deeper tie-up between Nissan and Renault, including possibly a full merger, despite strong reservations at the Japanese firm. “We are not at the stage for such discussions,” Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa told reporters on Monday. Saikawa also said he had not heard directly about a reported French proposal to integrate the Japanese carmaker’s management with Renault, adding that it was not the time to discuss revising the partners’ capital ties. The Nikkei newspaper reported on Sunday that a French government delegation had informed Tokyo that it would seek an integration of Renault and Nissan, most likely under the umbrella of a single holding company. “Since I have not heard this directly, I cannot comment,” Saikawa told reporters. And NHK quoted French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire as saying that an integration proposal was “not on the table now”.  A source familiar with Nissan’s thinking said the reported French proposal did not “make sense” given the two companies’ different cultures, Renault’s lower productivity and Nissan’s bigger contribution of key technology. “It’s a virtual merger, I don’t think it makes sense,” the source said, adding he had not heard directly of such a French proposal. Ghosn denies any wrongdoing as he awaits trial on charges of financial misconduct. “I will attend my trial not only because I am legally obligated to do so, but because I am eager to finally have the opportunity to defend myself,” Ghosn said in a statement. “I am not guilty of the charges against me and I look forward to defending my reputation in the courtroom.”      The co-chair of a committee set up by Nissan to examine the root cause of Ghosn’s alleged financial misconduct and propose corporate governance reforms questioned Ghosn’s standards. “Having read the report on the internal investigation, my initial impression was that the head of the company may have had questionable ethical standards,” committee co-chair Seiichiro Nishioka told a briefing on Sunday after the panel’s first meeting.

2019-01-27,"(Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) Chairman Philip Hampton will step down after more than three and a half years in the role, as Britain’s biggest drugmaker prepares to split its business into two. The announcement comes a month after GSK’s Chief Executive Emma Walmsley announced her boldest plans yet - to split the company into two businesses — one for prescription drugs and vaccines, the other for over-the-counter products. Walmsley, who took the helm in 2017, announced in December that GSK and Pfizer (PFE.N) would combine their consumer health businesses in a joint venture with sales of 9.8 billion pounds ($12.7 billion), 68 percent-owned by the British company, in an all-equity transaction. “Following the announcement of our deal with Pfizer and the intended separation of the new consumer business, I believe this is the right moment to step down and allow a new Chair to oversee this process through to its conclusion over the next few years,” Hampton said in a statement. Hampton, aged 65, was paid a sum of 700,000 pounds  ($900,550), of which he elected to take 25 percent in GSK shares, according to the company’s 2017 annual report. He took the top job at GSK at a testing time - just after a profit warning in 2014 due to weak sales of its core respiratory drugs.  The Briton was tasked with helping steer the drugmaker back to sustainable growth. Shares of GSK have, however, remained flat after peaking about 17 percent during his tenure. They were little changed in early trading on Monday.  GSK, whose consumer products include Sensodyne toothpaste and Panadol painkillers, has lagged rivals in recent years in producing multibillion-dollar blockbusters and it largely sat out a spate of dealmaking by rivals under previous CEO Andrew Witty.  Seeking to reassure investors of its financial strength, GSK extended its guarantee on the dividend by stating it expected to pay unchanged dividends of 80 pence per share for 2019. Before joining GSK, Hampton was chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS.L) and J Sainsbury plc (SBRY.L).  He was parachuted in to help rescue RBS following its 45 billion pounds bailout during the financial crisis and led the bank through a turbulent period of transition. GSK, which has been looking to buy early-stage assets and partner with companies, said it had started the search for a successor.

2019-01-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - Asking prices for British property are rising at the slowest pace since 2012 amid ongoing Brexit worries, property website Rightmove said on Monday. Rightmove’s data suggested a continuation of the weakness in British house prices that intensified in 2018, especially in and around London where fears of economic damage from Brexit made buyers loath to pay more for already-expensive homes. “Given the current market backdrop and ongoing political turmoil, it’s not surprising that the more challenging conditions in London and nearby regions mean they have had a slower start to the year,” Rightmove director Miles Shipside said. Last week the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said its members had the most negative outlook for house sales over the coming three months since its records began in 1999. Asking prices on Rightmove, which advertises property for 90 percent of British estate agents, were 0.4 percent higher in the first two weeks of January than a year earlier.  Prices were also 0.4 percent up on December levels, the weakest December to January increase since 2012. Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29, but Prime Minister Theresa May’s record parliamentary defeat over her plans last week has thrown into doubt the terms, timing and even the certainty of Brexit. Rightmove said potential buyers were tuning out the political noise and the number of people viewing property on its website in the first half of January was up 5 percent from 2018. “Mass-market home-movers have a track-record of ignoring the politics and continuing to satisfy their housing needs, and as long as these fundamentals remain in place through this period of uncertainty, the market will keep moving,” Shipside said.

2019-01-27,"LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (Reuters) - Four men were arrested on Sunday over a car bomb attack in Northern Ireland’s Londonderry and police are looking into whether the New IRA militant group was responsible, officers said. Two men in their twenties were detained hours after the explosion on Saturday evening outside the city’s courthouse. Two other men aged 34 and 42 were arrested in the city later on Sunday. No one was injured by the blast.   “Fortunately it didn’t kill anybody but clearly it was a very significant attempt to kill people here in this community,” Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton told a news conference. Hamilton said the main focus of the investigation was on the New IRA - one of a small number of groups opposed to a 1998 peace deal that largely ended three decades of violence in the British-run province. They have carried out sporadic attacks in recent years. Police in Northern Ireland and European Union member Ireland have warned that a return to a hard border between the two after Brexit, complete with customs and other checks, could be a target for militant groups. Politicians from all sides - including Sinn Fein, the former political wing of the nationalist Irish Republican Army - condemned the explosion. “Shame on you. Shame on you and stop,” said Mary Lou McDonald, leader of Sinn Fein, which signed the peace agreement. She told BBC Northern Ireland the blast was an “outrageous attack”. The Northern Ireland police force said it was given only minutes to evacuate children and hundreds of hotel guests before the explosion of what they described as a highly unstable, crude device that could have detonated at any time. Officers spotted a suspicious vehicle at the scene at about 1955 GMT, then received a warning five minutes later that a device had been left there, the force said. “We moved immediately to begin evacuating people from nearby buildings including hundreds of hotel guests, 150 people from the Masonic Hall and a large number of children from a church youth club,” Hamilton said earlier. The pizza delivery vehicle was destroyed by the blast ten minutes after that. The van had been hijacked nearby by two armed men around two hours earlier, police said. CCTV footage released by police showed the driver running from the vehicle after leaving it outside the courthouse. Hamilton said he thought the attack marked a continuation of militants’ campaigns, rather than an escalation. The last fatal attack involving a car bomb was carried out in 2016 by the New IRA when a prison officer was fatally injured by a device left under his van in Belfast. About 3,600 people were killed in the conflict that was fought between mainly Protestant unionists who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom and predominantly Catholic nationalists. “There is no doubt that in terms of the Brexit element, there will be a section within our communities who will want to exploit that and use that to further their own objectives but I wouldn’t put that as the sole purpose,” Gary Middleton, a local Democratic Unionist Party member of Northern Ireland’s devolved government, told Reuters.

2019-01-27,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Sunday it was unclear how any talks between Britain and Ireland on resolving the question of the Irish backstop could help the European Union’s deal with London on Brexit. British Prime Minister Theresa May is to set out her plans for Brexit on Monday after UK lawmakers rejected her deal with the EU last week, throwing the process into disarray. The United Kingdom is due to leave the bloc on March 29. Asked by ZDF television about media reports on possible plans by May to negotiate a bilateral deal with the Irish government, Maas said it was unclear how it would work. “We have to negotiate and also agree a withdrawal agreement with Britain. It is a bit of a mystery to me what the British government wants to negotiate with Dublin or what sort of an additional agreement it should be,” he told German television.  “It won’t have any effect on what was agreed with the (European) Commission.”  The Sunday Times reported that May was seeking a bilateral treaty with Ireland to remove the contentious backstop arrangement that the EU insists on to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.  Maas also said it would be “very difficult” to renegotiate Britain’s withdrawal agreement with the EU. “All 27 members must agree. In the last few days there have been relatively clear statements that there are many who are not ready to and there are some that are open to it. We have to wait to see what the Britons suggest,” he said. In an interview with Monday’s edition of Die Welt daily, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a pro-European, said it was pointless for the EU to make concessions to Britain. “Even if the EU moves away from the backstop and gives up the position of the Irish government, which I don’t think will happen, even that wouldn’t save the deal,” he said, adding he put the risk of a no-deal Brexit at just 10 percent. Like the EU as a whole, Germany does not want a no-deal Brexit but it has plans in place just in case. The DIHK Chambers of Commerce, a body that represents German businesses, also argued that the EU should not offer Britain concessions. “If we move towards the Britons further, the integrity of the internal market will be at stake and this is not negotiable from the point of view of German industry,” Volker Treier, foreign trade chief of the DIHK, told Tagesspiegel.

2019-01-27,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Women marched in hundreds of U.S. cities and overseas on Saturday to mark the second anniversary of demonstrations that drew millions of protesters to the streets the day after Republican President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January 2017. Women’s March, a national nonprofit organisation that evolved from the initial Washington march, again hosted its main event in Washington, with hundreds of “sister” marches in other cities. March On, a separate grassroots coalition that also grew from the original march, coordinated hundreds of marches in cities such as Boston, Houston, Baltimore and Denver. Leaders of both groups said they would use this year’s marches to push policy related to raising the minimum wage, access to reproductive healthcare and voting rights, among other issues. They are aiming to mobilise women to vote ahead of the 2020 elections, when Trump is expected to be the Republican nominee for president. “There is definitely huge, huge focus on the 2020 elections,” said March On’s Natalie Sanchez, an organizer of the 2017 Boston Women’s March who is also with March Forward Massachusetts, which organised Saturday’s march there. U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who launched her bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination this week, addressed the women’s march in Des Moines, Iowa, the state that holds the first nominating contest and acts as a proving ground for White House hopefuls. She told the crowd that the 2017 march was one of the most influential political moments in her life. “Now is the time to get off the sidelines. Our democracy only works when people like you stand up and demands it,” Gillibrand said. Kimberly Graham, 54, an attorney in Des Moines, said attending the march there two years ago gave her hope after Trump’s election left her feeling dejected. Her excitement from seeing so many women and minorities win midterm election races has inspired her to weigh challenging Republican U.S. Senator Joni Ernst. “It’s given me a lot of hope that things will turn around. That it is darkest before the light,” Graham said.  Activists say the marches were a chance to celebrate the gains made in the 2018 elections, which saw more women elected to the U.S. Congress than ever before. The newly elected women - nearly all Democrats - include the first Muslim women and first Native American women in Congress, as well as the first black women to represent their states in New England. Many cited Trump’s presidency among the reasons they decided to run for office. As the political movement that grew out of hundreds of loosely affiliated marches in 2017 has grown, divisions have emerged. In some cities, like New York and Washington, there was more than one march or demonstration due to criticism that some Women’s March leaders are anti-Semitic - a charge those leaders have sought to dispel in recent interviews and statements. Leaders of Women’s March and March On say there is a role for everyone and that divisions in leadership have not detracted from the overall movement. Julie Wash, 57, a librarian from Saratoga Springs, New York,  said Women’s March leader Tamika Mallory - who has faced blowback for her support of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan - is being held to a different standard than Trump and other white, male leaders. “There’s a level of accountability that we need to hold white establishment men to if we’re going to hold Tamika Mallory to that standard,” Wash said. Wash came to the Washington march with her friend Nan Sullivan, 65, a business owner also from Saratoga Springs. “Give us the whole table. Don’t give us a seat. Just give us the whole table. Get out of the way and we’ll clean up the mess,” Sullivan said. The marches also have been criticized as being unwelcoming to conservative women, who may support Trump’s presidency and oppose abortion rights. The annual March for Life by anti-abortion campaigners was held in Washington on Friday, attended by Vice President Mike Pence.

2019-01-27,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish prosecutors have prepared the charge sheet against a local employee of the U.S. consulate who was arrested over alleged links to the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, Demiroren News Agency (DHA) reported. Gulen is accused by Ankara of orchestrating a coup attempt in 2016, in which he denies all involvement. Consulate worker Metin Topuz’s arrest in October 2017 added to existing tensions between the United States and Turkey, and led to a months-long suspension of bilateral visa services. Relations between the two NATO allies have been strained over U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in northern Syria, Turkey’s plan to buy a Russian missile defence system, and the U.S. jailing of an executive at a Turkish state bank in an Iran sanctions-busting case. Topuz is in jail along with two other local consulate employees, as is a Turkish-U.S. national and former NASA scientist who faces terrorism charges. Washington wants all of them to be released. DHA quoted from Topuz’s 78-page indictment, which stated that he had very close contact with police officers suspected of playing a role in the coup attempt. The news agency said the document listed President Tayyip Erdogan and former Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, amongst others, as complainants. Under Turkish law, a judge would now decide if Topuz’s case should proceed to trial. The prosecutor’s office could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday. Ankara has repeatedly demanded that the United States extradite Gulen to Turkey. The cleric has lived in self-imposed exile since 1999. Turkey has detained 160,000 people and dismissed nearly the same number of civil servants over suspected links to the coup attempt, according to the U.N. human rights office. There was some easing of U.S.-Turkish tensions late last year when an Ankara court freed a U.S. pastor who had been detained for two years over accusations of links to Kurdish militants and supporters of Gulen.

2019-01-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - Former British prime minister John Major urged Theresa May on Saturday to drop her “red lines” on Brexit or allow parliament to find a way forward to avoid a damaging no-deal departure from the European Union in March. Major said he compromised on key decisions on the Northern Irish peace process and the first Gulf War while prime minister between 1990 and 1997, and May should do the same after her Brexit plan was rejected by a huge majority in parliament. “Her deal is dead and I don’t think honestly that tinkering with it is going to make very much difference if any difference at all,” Major, who campaigned to stay in the EU ahead of the 2016 referendum, told BBC Radio. May is due to tell parliament on Monday how she intends to proceed on Brexit. Lawmakers may then propose alternatives to see if any could command majority support. “If we leave in chaos and without a deal, that seems to me to be the worst of all outcomes,” Major said. May should therefore “go around” lawmakers in her party who say they are ready to accept a no-deal Brexit and drop her opposition to key issues in the negotiations, Major - who also faced a revolt inside the Conservative Party over Europe - said. May has ruled out staying in the EU’s single market, an option that is considered less economically damaging, because Britain would not be able to control immigration from the bloc. She has also rejected staying in a customs union with the EU. If May cannot compromise, she should allow parliament to find a way to overcome its splits, Major said. “I think there are signs parliament might be able to reach consensus,” he said. Failing that, Britain should have a fresh referendum on its membership of the EU. In the meantime, delaying Brexit was wise, Major said.  Major’s comments were rejected as “Remainer elite views” by a Conservative lawmaker who said May would break her promises to voters if she considered staying in the EU’s single market or a customs union or holding a second referendum. “Brexit would become meaningless. We wouldn’t be leaving the European Union, we would be staying in the European Union,” Suella Braverman told the BBC.

2019-01-27,"KABUL (Reuters) - A former warlord accused of historic war crimes entered Afghanistan’s presidential race on Saturday in a new challenge to President Ashraf Ghani who allowed him to return from exile two decades he was forced out by the Taliban. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, whose fighters killed thousands in Kabul during the bloody civil war of the 1990s, has remained a divisive figure since his return from exile in 2016.  His decision to contest the presidential polls in July is seen by analysts as the ex-warlord’s attempt legitimise his Hizb-i-Islami party. The faction has been blamed for atrocities committed during Afghanistan’s brutal civil war, which led many Afghans to welcome the emergence of the Taliban in 1996 in the hope the hardline Islamist group would restore law and order. In 2003, the U.S. State Department listed him as a terrorist, accusing him of taking part in and supporting attacks by al Qaeda and the Taliban. But Washington later welcomed Ghani’s decision to sign a peace deal with Hekmatyar. In 2016, President Ghani’s government granted immunity to Hekmatyar but the former warlord has been critical of his administration and the parliamentary election process in 2018. Announcing his candidacy, Hekmatyar pledged to restore peace and security and said the current government had failed to end the war with the Taliban. “Our country’s situation requires a powerful central government lead by an elected president supported by the majority of people,” he told a news conference in Kabul. The July election faces serious security challenges with the Taliban threatening large parts of the country. The polls will be a crucial test for election officials who were criticised for failing to conduct free and fair parliamentary elections last October. The 2014 presidential election won by Ghani was also tainted by accusations of widespread cheating.  Afghanistan’s presidential race is now in full swing, with several former officials, politicians lining up to challenge Ghani who is expected to register his candidacy for a second term on Sunday. On Saturday Interior Minister Amrullah Saleh resigned to run for the vice-presidency as part of Ghani’s team, according to two political sources. In December, Ghani appointed Saleh, a former security official and an uncompromising opponent of the Taliban, to his government in a bid to secure the support of former opponents for a second term.

2019-01-27,"KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan Interior Minister Amrullah Saleh stepped down from his post on Saturday in order to run for the vice-presidency alongside President Ashraf Ghani who plans to bid for a second term in July’s election. The former top security official told Reuters by phone that he had resigned and two political sources said he would join Ghani’s team. “He wants to contest for the post of vice-president,” said a source from the presidential palace in Kabul. Saleh, who commands strong support among Afghanistan’s minority ethnic Tajiks, had been expected to oppose Ghani in the election, which has been pushed back from April to July. Under Afghanistan’s electoral system, all members of government except the president and vice president must step down in order to run for office. In December, Ghani appointed Saleh, a former security official and an uncompromising opponent of the Taliban, to his government in a bid to secure the support of former opponents for a second term. Afghan forces have been dying in record numbers in the face of a resurgent Taliban. U.S. President Donald Trump is considering slashing the number of American troops in the country in half. However the White House says there has been no official order. Afghanistan’s presidential race is now in full swing, with several former officials and politicians lining up to challenge Ghani who is expected to register his candidacy for a second term on Sunday. Former warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, whose fighters killed thousands in Kabul during the bloody civil war of the 1990s, joined the presidential race on Saturday. The political landscape is dominated by ethnic loyalties, personal alliances and often unstable coalitions between powerful regional leaders. “Ghani’s decision to include Saleh in his presidential bid reflects how alliances are being formed quickly and ideological differences are being ignored,” said a Western diplomat in Kabul.

2019-01-27,"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Friday it would cut thousands of jobs to rein in costs as it plans to increase production of lower-priced versions of its crucial Model 3 sedan, sending its shares down as much as 10 percent. The company, which has struggled to achieve long-term profitability and keep a tight lid on expenses, also said it expects fourth-quarter profit to be lower than the preceding quarter. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said the need for lower-priced versions of Model 3 will become even greater from July, when the U.S. tax credit again drops in half, adding $1,875 to the car’s price tag, and again at the end of the year when it goes away entirely.  The phase-out of the electric vehicle tax break confronts Tesla with the choice of raising prices at the risk of losing customers or slashing costs by thousands of dollars per vehicle, a herculean task for an automaker. Musk also faces a narrowing window in which his electric luxury vehicles enjoy a monopoly in the segment that Tesla created and defined. Over the next several years, established automakers plan to spend nearly $300 billion on electric vehicles and batteries.  Legacy luxury brands such as Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) Audi and Porsche, Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz and BMW all plan new luxury electric vehicles.  Chinese startups such as Byton and NIO are pushing ahead with technically advanced electric vehicles, building on China’s aggressive support for cleaner cars. Most analysts expect China will be the world’s largest electric vehicle market.  Musk said on Friday the company would need to deliver at least the mid-range Model 3 version in all markets starting around May, as it needs to reach more customers who can afford the vehicles. Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Autotrader, said she expected the year to be challenging for all automakers as new vehicle sales slow. “It will be especially challenging for Tesla as it desperately tries to rack up more quarterly profits after having one in the third quarter, and it faces an onslaught of competitors in the next couple of years,” she said. The billionaire entrepreneur has been under intense pressure to stabilize production of the Model 3, a car that was unveiled in early 2016 to great fanfare and is seen critical to the company’s long-term viability. But Tesla has scrambled to get the Model 3 into the hands of customers, many of whom have been waiting since early 2016, and Musk said last year that Tesla had moved from “production hell to delivery logistics hell.” This is Tesla’s second job cut in seven months and comes just days after it cut U.S. prices for all vehicles and fell short on quarterly deliveries of its mass-market Model 3 sedan. In a memo to employees on Friday, Musk said 2018 was the “most challenging in Tesla’s history,” adding the company hired 30 percent more employees last year which was more than it could support. “I want to make sure that you know all the facts and figures and understand that the road ahead is very difficult,” Musk said. “There isn’t any other way.” Tesla sales benefited from a $7,500 federal tax credit on electric vehicles throughout 2018, but that full credit expired at the end of 2018, and new buyers will now receive only half that amount. The company reported a profit of $311.5 million, or $1.75 per share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, which Musk called Tesla’s “first meaningful profit” since the company started. For the fourth quarter, analysts on average expect the company’s net income to be $216.92 million on a reported basis. The estimate shrinks further in first quarter to $62.80 million, according to Refinitiv data. “This quarter, as with Q3, shipment of higher priced Model 3 variants (this time to Europe and Asia) will hopefully allow us, with great difficulty, effort and some luck, to target a tiny profit,” Musk said. Musk, who has often set goals and deadlines that Tesla has failed to meet, surprised investors by delivering on his pledge to make the company profitable in the third quarter, for only the third time in its 15-year existence. The electric carmaker said on Friday it would reduce full-time employee headcount by about 7 percent and retain only the most critical temps and contractors. In June, Tesla said it was cutting 9 percent of its workforce. Musk had tweeted in October that the company employed 45,000 people.

2019-01-27,"SANDRINGHAM, England (Reuters) - Queen Elizabeth’s 97-year-old husband Prince Philip has “no injuries of concern” Buckingham Palace said on Friday, after he visited hospital for a precautionary check up following a car crash the day before. Philip was at the wheel of his Land Rover when it collided with another car on a road close to the royals’ Sandringham private residence in Norfolk, eastern England. His car flipped over and landed on its side but he was able to walk away after being helped out of the vehicle by members of the public. Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, returned to Sandringham after the crash but went to a nearby hospital on Friday morning. “On doctor’s advice, The Duke of Edinburgh visited the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn this morning for a precautionary check-up,” the Palace said in a statement. “This confirmed His Royal Highness had no injuries of concern,” it added. “The Duke has returned to Sandringham.” The other driver, a 28-year-old woman, suffered cuts to her knee and a 45-year-old woman passenger in the car, which also had a nine-month-old baby on board, sustained a broken wrist. They were taken to hospital but later released. “It was an astonishing escape for everyone,” said Roy Warne, 75, who pulled the prince from the wreckage on Thursday afternoon.  “People could have been killed. The impact must have been enormous,” Warne, who was driving home with his wife when he saw the collision, told TV reporters. “He’s a very brave man. He didn’t make a big fuss about it and he went to ask everyone else if they were injured.”     Witnesses told media the accident had occurred when Philip was pulling out of a driveway onto a main road. Pictures from the scene showing Philip’s Land Rover overturned on the side of the road.   Police said both drivers involved in the accident had been breath tested but neither was over the alcohol limit.  “As is standard procedure with injury collisions, the incident will be investigated and any appropriate action taken,” Norfolk police said in a statement. “We are aware of the public interest in this case, however, as with any other investigation it would be inappropriate to speculate on the causes of the collision until an investigation is carried out.” Coincidentally, local councillors were meeting on Friday to discuss safety concerns and lower speed limits on the road where the accident took place. Philip retired from public life in 2017, although he still occasionally appears alongside his 92-year-old wife at official engagements. Although he missed the traditional church service on Christmas Day last month, the former naval officer is said to be in good health. He had a successful hip replacement surgery last year. Royal commentators said Philip, who married Elizabeth in 1947 and has been by her side throughout her record-breaking 66-year reign, would be loath to give up driving. There is no legal age in Britain to stop driving, but drivers over 70 must renew their licences every three years. Philip drove Barack Obama and his wife Michelle to lunch at Windsor Castle during their state visit to Britain in 2016, prompting the former U.S. president to remark: “I have to say I have never been driven by a Duke of Edinburgh before, but I can report it was very smooth riding.” The queen, a trained military driver during World War Two, is said to have shocked Saudi Arabia’s late King Abdullah, then crown prince, by climbing into the driver’s seat and taking him for a ride around her estate during a visit to Britain in 1998, when women were barred from driving in his kingdom.

2019-01-27,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - The EU Chemicals Agency ECHA on Friday proposed a ban on deliberately adding microplastics to products such as cosmetics, detergents and agricultural fertilisers in the EU by 2020 to combat pollution.  The tiny bits of plastic pollution in waterways and oceans are causing growing concern among scientists about their effect on marine ecosystems.  The European Commission, which estimates that between 70,000 and 200,000 tonnes of microplastics enter the environment each year, had requested the proposal from the ECHA as part of its plastics strategy.   “The aim is to avoid nearly 30,000 tonnes of microplastics ending up in nature a year,” the ECHA’s spokesman Matti Vainio said at a conference in Helsinki. The Commission’s Vice President Jyrki Katainen, who also spoke at the event, said an EU ban could set a standard for industries around the world. “The European Union is first in the world to have launched a comprehensive plastics strategy which aims at reducing also microplastics,” he said. The ECHA will present its official proposal within a year for the EU member countries to consider and Katainen said the Commission could approve it towards the end of 2020.  Vainio warned the use of microplastics would continue to increase rapidly without the ban. “It emerged as a surprise to us that agriculture is the largest user of microplastics”, Vainio said, referring to a widely-used technology to encapsulate agricultural fertilizers within tiny plastic shells that emit them slowly into the soil but leave behind microplastics. The proposed ban would exclude some products such as medicine and paints.

2019-01-27,"MANILA (Reuters) - Human rights groups expressed alarm at Sri Lanka’s leader on Friday for praising Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and his bloody war on drugs as an “example to the whole world”. Despite international condemnation of a crackdown that has killed thousands of Filipinos, visiting Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena told Duterte during a banquet this week that he wanted to “follow your footsteps to control this hazard”. Carlos Conde, Philippines researcher for the New York-based Human Rights Watch, said Duterte’s campaign was “a human rights calamity that no country in the world should even try to emulate”. “No ‘drug war’ that treated the drug problem purely from a crime perspective has ever succeeded,” he said. “What they have wrought are untold suffering and the further destruction of the rule of law and the diminution of human rights”.  The Philippine government has consistently refuted that and said the crackdown, which started in July 2016, was being administered lawfully. On Friday, presidential spokesman, Salvador Panelo, said any allegations of state-sponsored killings were “pure hogwash”.  Police say they have since killed at least 5,000 suspected drug dealers, although activists say the number could be far higher and they dispute official accounts that the killings were all in self-defence. More than 200 people in Bangladesh have been killed by police in a similar campaign. International drug smugglers have increasingly turned to Sri Lanka as a transit hub in Asia, authorities there have said. Predominantly Buddhist Sri Lanka voted in favour of a U.N. resolution for a moratorium on the death penalty in 2015, but Sirisena said last year he wanted convicted traffickers caught arranging drugs deals from jail to be executed.  Philippines human rights group iDefend said that if Sirisena was serious about following Duterte’s lead, he should be ready to face scrutiny by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague, which has started a preliminary examination into alleged crimes against humanity by Duterte. “We warn Asian leaders not to emulate the Philippine model but adopt a humane, evidence-based public health approach to the drugs issue through a rights-based governance that strengthens, not erodes democratic institutions,” iDefend spokesman Judy Pasimio said. A spokesman for Sirisena did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

2019-01-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s last-minute scramble to shape an EU exit, its biggest policy upheaval in half a century, stalled on Thursday as Prime Minister Theresa May and opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn dug in their heels for competing visions. After May’s two-year attempt to forge an amicable divorce with an independent trade policy was crushed by parliament in the biggest defeat for a British leader in modern history, May asked party leaders to forget self-interest to find a solution. Yet there was little sign on Thursday that either of the two major parties — which hold 88 percent of the 650 seats in parliament — were prepared to compromise on key demands. Corbyn said May had sent Britain hurtling towards the cliff edge of a disorderly exit on March 29 with no transition period, and urged her to ditch “red lines”.  But he repeated his own prerequisite for talks: a pledge to block a no-deal Brexit. May told Corbyn that was “an impossible condition” and urged him to join cross-party discussions. “You have always believed in the importance of dialogue in politics. Do you really believe that, as well as declining to meet for talks yourself, it is right to ask your MPs not to seek a solution with the government?,” she said in a letter.   The further May moves towards softening Brexit, the more she alienates dedicated Brexit supporters in her own Conservative party who think the threat of a no-deal exit is a big bargaining chip and should anyway not be feared. May’s spokeswoman said she held “constructive” talks on Thursday with MPs, including some from Labour. If she fails to forge consensus, the world’s fifth-largest economy will drop out of the European Union on March 29 without a deal or will be forced to delay Brexit, possibly holding a national election or another referendum. Corbyn said that he might look at options including another referendum — a remark that increased market expectations the chaos could ultimately delay or stop Brexit.  But a second referendum would take a year to organise, according to government guidance shown to MPs on Wednesday, a source in May’s office said. Corbyn wants May to call another election, something she has refused, having lost her parliamentary majority in a 2017 snap poll that left her reliant on the support of a small Northern Irish pro-Brexit party. She has also repeatedly said another referendum would corrode faith in democracy among the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the EU in 2016. Her spokesman said Britain had not raised the idea of delaying exit with the EU. As the United Kingdom tumbles towards its biggest political and economic shift since World War Two, other EU members have offered to talk. “We will do everything we can so that Britain exits with, and not without, an agreement,” said German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas.  EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the bloc was open to the possibility of a “more ambitious” deal than May’s, which he said could not be improved on under principles she set out. But they can do little until London decides what it wants. Ever since the UK voted by 52-48 percent to leave the EU, politicians have failed to agree on how or even whether to quit the bloc. If there is a solution to the riddle, it may be for parliament’s back-benchers to find it. May will on Monday put forward a motion on her proposed next steps. Over the following week, MPs will be able to propose alternatives. On Jan. 29, they will debate these plans, and voting on them should indicate whether any could get majority support. If a way forward emerges, May could then go back to the EU and seek changes to her deal. Parliament would still need to vote on any new agreement, and it is not clear when that might happen. Labour says it would back a deal with a permanent customs union with the EU — which would resolve the problem of managing the land border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic — as well as a close relationship with its single market and greater protections for workers and consumers. Most Conservative MPs reject a customs union because it would prevent Britain having an independent trade policy — one of their main demands. Without any deal, trade with the EU would default to basic World Trade Organization rules — a worrying prospect for manufacturers dependent on smooth, uncomplicated supply lines. Company chiefs are aghast at the crisis and say it has already damaged Britain’s reputation as Europe’s pre-eminent destination for foreign investment. From Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel to Scottish whisky distillers, firms want decisive government action. “If anybody believes that you can just go ahead without some sort of an agreement here, I think that that is reckless,” said John Bason, finance chief of Associated British Foods (ABF.L), a food and retail group with annual sales of over $20 billion (15.4 billion pounds).

2019-01-27,"HANOI (Reuters) - Hanoi is preparing to receive North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for a state visit, two sources told Reuters, while officials and diplomats said Vietnam is keen to host a second summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump. A source familiar with the matter said Kim will travel to Vietnam for an official state visit after the Feb. 4-8 lunar new year. A separate source confirmed Kim’s visit but did not give any dates. The United States and North Korea are holding high-level talks in Washington this week to discuss a second meeting between Trump and Kim to seek an “interim” deal to revitalise nuclear talks, U.S. and South Korean media have said. Communist-ruled Vietnam, which has good relations with both the United States and North Korea, has been widely touted as the most likely venue for a second meeting. The Southeast Asian country is keen to host the summit as a demonstration of its normalised ties with the United States, its foe during the Vietnam War, a Vietnamese government official and two diplomatic sources told Reuters. The Vietnamese source did not confirm if a state visit by Kim would be combined with a U.S.-North Korean summit. Media is heavily censored in Vietnam and the ruling Communist Party retains a tight control on information. The officials who spoke to Reuters did so on the strict condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the situation. Vietnam’s foreign ministry did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment.  A U.S. embassy spokeswoman in Hanoi said the embassy did not have anything to announce regarding the summit location, and referred questions to the White House. Trump told reporters in Washington on Jan. 6 that the United States and North Korea are “negotiating a location” for a second summit, and that “it will be announced probably in the not too distant future.” White House officials have declined to comment further. Kim and Trump met for a historic summit in Singapore in June, but have since struggled to make progress towards denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. Top North Korean officials, including former spy chief Kim Yong Chol, were seen at Beijing airport on Thursday, and are believed to be headed to the United States for meetings with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and possibly Trump. Asked about a possible high-level meeting this week, a State Department spokesman said: “We have no meetings to announce.” Both Hanoi and the central Vietnam city of Danang have been viewed by analysts as possible locations for a second summit.  A senior Danang-based official said the city had not been asked to host such an event, but had received instructions to prepare for a possible “A1” visit, referring to a high-profile foreign leader. A senior South Korean official earlier told Reuters that the United States has “various options” on the location, which would be decided after consultations with North Korea, while another official said that Vietnam is only one of the countries keen to host the summit.  Vietnam, which rose from the ashes of a victorious but costly war with the United States and transformed itself into one of Asia’s fastest-growing economies, has developed close strategic ties with Washington. In 2016, Washington ended a decades-old arms embargo on Vietnam, and last year a U.S. aircraft carrier visited Vietnam for the first time since the end of the Vietnam War. Vietnam’s exports to the United States, its largest export market, rose 14.3 percent last year to $47.53 billion, accounting for nearly 20 percent of Vietnam’s total exports. North Korea can learn from Vietnam’s experience in building ties with the United States, said Le Dang Doanh, a Vietnamese economist and former government adviser who has given lectures to North Korean delegations visiting Vietnam. “They asked a lot about how Vietnam can normalise relations with the United States after losing so many Vietnamese lives during the war,” Doanh said. “I told them we never forget the past, but we also look to the future.”  Reporting by James Pearson in HANOI.; Additional reporting by Hyonhee Shin and Josh Smith in SEOUL; Editing by John Chalmers and Raju Gopalakrishnan",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-vietnam-northkorea/vietnam-prepares-for-kim-jong-un-visit-amid-talk-of-second-summit-with-trump-idUKKCN1PB0QB,2019-01-27,"Hanoi is preparing to receive North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for a state visit, two sources told Reuters, while officials and diplomats said Vietnam is keen to host a second summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump.",Vietnam prepares for Kim Jong Un visit amid talk of second summit with Trump
2019-01-27,"LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Hitachi Ltd (6501.T) put a $28 billion (£21.6 billion) nuclear power project in Britain on hold on Thursday, dealing a blow to the country’s plans for the replacement of ageing plants. Hitachi’s UK unit Horizon Nuclear Power failed to find private investors for its plan to build a plant at Wylfa in Anglesey, Wales, which was expected to provide about 6 percent of Britain’s electricity. “We’ve made the decision to freeze the project from the economic standpoint as a private company,” Hitachi said, adding it had booked a write-down of 300 billion yen (£2.1 billion). Chief executive Toshiaki Higashihara said Hitachi could seek to withdraw completely from the project and sell the Horizon unit, depending on discussions with the British government. Hitachi shares have risen 13 percent since Japanese media first reported the possible suspension last week. The Japanese company had urged the UK government to boost financial support for the planned power station. Higashihara, however, denied turmoil over Britain’s impending exit from the European Union had any impact on Hitachi’s decision to freeze the project. People close to the matter had previously said it had limited the government’s capacity to devise plans. The withdrawal of the Japanese conglomerate could leave the nuclear newbuild industry open to Russian and Chinese state-owned companies as Western private firms struggle to compete. China’s General Nuclear Services, an industrial partnership between China General Nuclear Power Corp (CGN) and French utility EDF (EDF.PA), plans to make a number of investments in Britain’s nuclear power sector, most notably the Hinkley Point C project in southwest England. China’s CGN told Reuters it would bring forward plans to build a nuclear plant in Bradwell, eastern England, helping to plug a potential supply gap. British Energy Secretary Greg Clark said the government would explore different options for funding new nuclear plants, as costs for renewable energy had fallen so sharply it was difficult to justify higher subsidies. One option is a regulated asset-based model, under which investors receive some of the funding for projects as they are developed, rather than the contract-for-difference model, which provides funding only when electricity generation has begun. The government will give an update on this assessment during summer. Britain wants new nuclear plants to help replace its ageing fleet of nuclear and coal plants coming offline in the 2020s, but high up-front costs have deterred construction. Another Japanese firm, Toshiba Corp (6502.T), scrapped its British NuGen project last year after its U.S. reactor unit Westinghouse went bankrupt and it failed to find a buyer. In total, the two Japanese projects had aimed to add some 9.6 gigawatts (GW) to UK electricity capacity. Horizon had planned to build in total at least 5.8 GW of new capacity at the Wylfa site and in south Gloucestershire, and Toshiba’s NuGen was expected to add around 3.8 GW with three reactors. Horizon Nuclear Power said it could resume development at Anglesey in the future. The project, which was slated for completion in the late 2020s, had approval for the nuclear reactor design but had not yet started construction.  The firm said it would begin consultations with existing staff. The plant would have employed 850 people once operational, with construction workforces of up to 9,000.   Mycle Schneider, publisher of the World Nuclear Industry Status Report, said the Hitachi decision was a consequence of changing energy economics. The investment would not even be able to compete with unsubsidised offshore wind, the most expensive renewable energy technology, Schneider said.  “Time for the UK government to come up with a plan B,” Schneider added.

2019-01-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - A second referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union would take more than a year to organise, according to official government guidance shown to lawmakers on Wednesday, a source in Prime Minister Theresa May’s office said. Earlier, a spokeswoman for May told reporters that a one-page document had been shown to lawmakers during meetings aimed at finding a way forward on Brexit. “In order to inform the discussions, a very short paper set out in factual detail the number of months that would be required, this was illustrative only and our position of course is that there will be no second referendum,” she said. May has been meeting lawmakers from all parties on Thursday in an attempt to find a way out of an impasse over how Britain should leave the EU, after May’s own plan was resoundingly rejected by parliament on Tuesday.

2019-01-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - The outlook for Britain’s housing market is darkening fast ahead of Brexit, with sales expectations falling to their lowest level in at least 20 years by one measure, surveys showed on Thursday. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said the net balance of -28 in December among surveyors about the short-term outlook for housing sales was the weakest since it began asking the question in 1999. The housing market has slowed since the June 2016 Brexit referendum, with house prices, as measured by mortgage lenders Halifax and Nationwide, growing at the slowest pace in around five years. Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29 and there is still no clarity over the terms of its departure, after MPs rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s proposals by a huge margin on Tuesday. A separate survey from the Bank of England showed lenders in Britain expect demand for mortgages and credit cards will fall by the greatest extent seen for several years. Its gauge of forecast demand for mortgage lending over the next three months fell to -17.5 in the fourth quarter of 2018 from 0.2 in the third quarter, its lowest level since late 2010. The BoE survey also showed lenders expect demand for credit card lending to fall at the fastest pace since records started in 2007. “The (BoE) credit conditions survey added to the evidence that the housing market is currently on the back foot amid heightened uncertainties and challenging conditions. This follows a very weak RICS December report,” said Howard Archer, economist at the EY ITEM Club consultancy. Simon Rubinsohn, RICS’ chief economist, said December’s fall in price expectations was linked to Brexit uncertainty, which has deepened further since parliament rejected May’s deal. GRAPHIC: UK housing sales expectations hit record low - RICS - tmsnrt.rs/2SWjq9e “Looking a little further out, there is some comfort provided by the suggestion that transactions nationally should stabilise as some of the fog lifts, but that moment feels a way off for many respondents to the survey,” Rubinsohn said. In a report in November, the Bank said a “disorderly” exit scenario — involving severe delays at UK borders and financial markets losing confidence in British institutions — could lead to sterling falling to almost the same value as the dollar, 6.5 percent inflation and a 30 percent fall in house prices. BoE Governor Mark Carney said on Wednesday that sterling’s rise after the Brexit vote suggested investors now see less risk of a no-deal Brexit or the prospect of a delay, but added that he would not put much weight on these moves. RICS’ measure of house prices in December was its weakest since August 2012 at -19, below the median forecast of -13 in a Reuters poll of economists. Prices were expected to remain flat over the next 12 months  with the exception of London and south east where they have been falling, RICS said.

2019-01-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - China’s General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) IPO-CGNP.HK will bring forward plans to build a nuclear plant in Britain, it said on Thursday, helping plug a gap left by the failure of two Japanese projects. Japan’s Hitachi Ltd (6501.T) confirmed on Thursday it had frozen plans for a plant in Wales, while Toshiba Corp (6502.T) scrapped its British NuGen project last year. The British government said it offered a package of financial support to Hitachi after it requested more help, but the firm said the economics still did not add up. Hitachi said Britain’s impending departure from the European Union did not play a role in its decision. Britain wants to build a fleet of new nuclear plants to help replace aging coal and nuclear sites set to close in the 2020s. High up-front costs have delayed construction. CGN hopes to build several nuclear plants in Britain, starting with a project in Bradwell, Essex, in which France’s EDF (EDF.PA) is a 33.5 percent development partner. “We plan to advance the date for coming into commercial operation to the early 2030s, a couple of years earlier than previously planned,” Robert Davies, chief operating officer of CGN UK, said of the plans for the Bradwell facility. No decisions have been taken on the capacity of CGN’s Bradwell plant, which will use Chinese reactor technology. The AP1000 reactor is about two years through a four-year generic design approval (GDA) process with Britain’s regulator. Western governments have grown increasingly concerned about possible security threats posed by investments made by Chinese firms in their economies, including telecoms and nuclear power. Davies sought to allay any fears about the Chinese role. “We understand the sensitivities surrounding operating a nuclear plant and are open to another entity operating our plants in the UK, if that is what the government wants,” he said. Hitachi bought New Horizon Nuclear Power, which was developer for the Welsh plant and three others, in 2012. At the time, CGN had also shown an interest in the unit. High upfront costs have been a hurdle to new nuclear plants. EDF’s Hinkley Point C, Britain’s first new plant in 20 years and in which CGN holds 33.5 percent, is estimated to cost about 20 billion pounds. It won approval from EDF’s board after a securing a state subsidy that the National Audit Office said could cost consumers 30 billion pounds. “It has to be affordable for consumers. All developers of new nuclear plants know they must come in at a price well below that of Hinkley Point C,” Davies said. “Once the reactor design has approval, post GDA, we will have a clearer steer on the total cost of the project,” he said, adding that a final investment decision could then be taken. CGN also has a 20 percent development stake in EDF’s Sizewell C nuclear plant, which EDF hopes to start building in 2021.

2019-01-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will explore its options for funding new nuclear plants as the cost of renewables has fallen so sharply it could not justify much higher subsidies for Hitachi’s (6501.T) Horizon nuclear project which the Japanese company halted on Friday, the UK energy secretary said.

2019-01-27,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government is actively considering stricter security requirements and other ways to exclude China’s Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] from a buildout of fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks, the Handelsblatt newspaper reported. Handelsblatt, citing government sources, said government officials were discussing setting security standards that Huawei could not achieve, effectively blocking its participation.  Changes to the German telecommunications law were also under consideration as a last resort, the paper said. The deliberations would mark a shift from the German government’s position in October, when it told lawmakers it saw no legal basis to exclude any vendors from an upcoming 5G auction following warnings from Washington. The government told lawmakers in a more recent response that  the security of 5G networks was “extremely relevant”, and would guide its upcoming decisions, Handelsblatt reported.  U.S. officials have briefed allies that Huawei is ultimately at the beck and call of the Chinese state, while warning that its network equipment may contain “back doors” that could open them up to cyber espionage. Germany’s Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) announced in December that it would review its vendor strategy and France’s Orange (ORAN.PA) said it would not hire the Chinese firm to build its next-generation network in France. The shift by the national market leaders, both partly state owned, followed Huawei’s exclusion on national security grounds by some U.S. allies, led by Australia, from building their fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks. Huawei says the security concerns are unfounded. Tensions have been heightened by the arrest of Huawei’s chief financial officer in Canada for possible extradition to the United States. Handelsblatt quoted Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei as saying his company had never received a request from a government to transmit information in violation of any regulations.  “I love my country, I support the Communist Party, but I would never do anything that would harm another country in the world,” it quoted him as saying.

2019-01-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s leading insurance trade body has warned UK motorists they will be breaking the law if they drive in the European Union without special proof of insurance after March 29, if politicians fail to strike a Brexit withdrawal deal.  The Association of British Insurers (ABI) called on consumers and companies who plan to travel by road in the EU after Brexit day to request a ‘green card’ from their insurer one month in advance, citing the growing possibility of a disorderly British departure from the bloc. The ABI advice, issued a day after Prime Minister Theresa May’s proposed Brexit deal was rejected by UK lawmakers, represents a major call to action to millions of policyholders who drive in the EU for business and pleasure each year. It follows failure by the European Commission to confirm a waiver of the green card scheme agreed by European insurance authorities in May, the ABI said. The same requirements would  apply to EU motorists travelling to the UK, it added. In 2017, 2.4 million heavy good vehicles travelled from Britain to the continent, while a further 370,000 travelled to Northern Ireland, according to official statistics, the ABI said.  “It remains the case that insurers do not want a ‘no deal’ Brexit; it would be bad for the economy and bad for our customers. We continue to hope these arrangements are never needed and urge the Government, UK Parliament and EU27 to agree an orderly way forward,” ABI Director General Huw Evans said. The ABI reassured policyholders that travel insurance would continue to work in a no-deal Brexit scenario, even in the event the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) system - which allows individuals some free healthcare in the EU - is not replaced.

2019-01-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May won a confidence vote in the British parliament on Wednesday and then appealed to MPs from across the political divide to come together to try to break the impasse on a Brexit divorce agreement. MPs voted 325 to 306 that they had confidence in May’s government, just 24 hours after handing her European Union withdrawal deal a crushing defeat that left Britain’s exit from the bloc in disarray. With the clock ticking down to March 29, the date set in law for Brexit, the United Kingdom is now in the deepest political crisis in half a century as it grapples with how, or even whether, to exit the European project it joined in 1973. After the results of the confidence vote were announced to cheers from her Conservative MPs, May said she believed parliament had a duty to find a solution that delivered on the 2016 Brexit referendum result. But with lawmakers (MPs) deadlocked on the way forward, the United Kingdom could face a disorderly “no-deal” Brexit, a delay to Brexit, or even another referendum on membership.  “Now MPs have made clear what they don’t want, we must all work constructively together to set out what parliament does want,” May said in a statement outside her Downing Street office. “That’s why I am inviting MPs from all parties to come together to find a way forward. This is now the time to put self-interest aside.” After the confidence vote, May met several party leaders, but the main opposition leader, Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn, refused to hold talks unless a no-deal Brexit was ruled out.  The votes on Tuesday and Wednesday brought into sharp relief the problem May faces; trying to win over pro-EU supporters in her own and other parties without alienating those who keep her in power - for instance, by giving up the “no-deal Brexit” that they see as a crucial bargaining chip.  Hardline Conservative Brexit-supporters, who last month made an unsuccessful attempt to oust her as leader, and the Northern Irish party that props up her minority government will not countenance a deal that keeps close ties with the EU. “The confidence and supply arrangement (to support May) of course is built upon delivering Brexit on the basis of our shared priorities,” said Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party. However, Corbyn said no positive talks were possible unless a no-deal Brexit was taken off the table. His party wants a permanent customs union with the EU, a close relationship with its single market and greater protections for workers and consumers. May’s spokesman said she was not ruling out a no-deal option and that it was government policy to be outside an EU customs union. Critics said this meant May was not budging from the deal that had alienated all sides in parliament.  Other opposition parties wrote to Corbyn after the confidence vote to demand he now back a second referendum, which Labour has agreed should be considered if it cannot force an election. However, he and other senior political figures fear that stopping Brexit could alienate the 17.4 million people who voted to leave.     Sterling GBP=D3 was trading just off two-month highs against the euro after May won the confidence vote, with many investors believing the prospect of a no-deal exit had receded as parliament hardened its stance against it. [GBP/] Companies warned of catastrophic job losses and chaos at ports if there was no deal. Trade with the EU would then default to basic World Trade Organization rules, which many argue would disrupt innumerable manufacturing supply chains relying on rapid, friction-free trade. Ever since Britain voted by 52-48 percent to leave the EU in June 2016, the political class has been debating how to leave the European project forged by France and Germany after the devastation of World War Two. Tuesday’s crushing defeat appears to have killed off May’s two-year strategy of forging an amicable divorce in which a status-quo transition period would be followed by Britain operating an independent trade policy alongside close ties to the EU, the world’s biggest single market. Other members of the EU, which combined has about six times Britain’s economic might, called for discussion but indicated there was little chance of fundamental change to the deal May had negotiated.  German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that “the time for playing games is now over”. For the EU, already reeling from crises over debt and refugees, Brexit may be the biggest blow in its 60-year history, though its 27 other members have shown remarkable unity on the issue. Brexit supporters anticipate some short-term economic pain but say Britain will then thrive if cut loose from what they cast as a doomed experiment in German-dominated unity.  Opponents of Brexit say it is folly that will weaken the West, make Britain poorer and torpedo what remains of its post-imperial clout.

Those killed in Tuesday’s attack on an upscale hotel and office complex included one policeman who had been wounded, Inspector General Joseph Boinnet said.  Sixteen of the dead, including the policeman, were Kenyan, he said, as well as a British man, an American man, and three people of African origin whose nationality was uncertain.  Two suspects had also been arrested for helping the attackers, he said.

2019-01-27,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - International companies with regional headquarters in Kenya said on Wednesday that a deadly militant attack on an upscale Nairobi hotel complex would not scare them away from a city that has long been East Africa’s business hub. At least 14 people were killed and about 700 evacuated under fire after gunmen stormed the upscale dusitD2 hotel and office complex on Tuesday. Hotel guests and workers from companies like Visa Inc had to hole up for several hours while the attackers were hunted down and killed. The raid echoed a 2013 assault by Islamist militants on an Israel-built shopping centre in the same neighbourhood that killed 67 people: Images beamed across the world during that assault dented Kenya’s image abroad and scared off tourists, damaging a vital sector of the economy.  Among Nairobi’s other potential deterrents are sporadic political violence that erupts during elections. But companies say the latest attack won’t alter their plans to work in the region’s richest city. “We are very committed to Nairobi. GE is very committed to Kenya,” said Brenda Mbathi, executive director for government affairs in East Africa at General Electric.  The American conglomerate set up its regional headquarters for sub-Saharan Africa in Nairobi in 2011, and now provides medical equipment to the Kenyan government and turbines to private power plant developers.  Convenient flights, a skilled English-speaking workforce and advanced information technology infrastructure have persuaded multinationals like GE and Alphabet Inc to set up regional hubs in the city. The influx has helped shore up Kenya’s long-held position as East Africa’s wealthiest economy amid tough competition from other regional countries and Dubai to play a regional hub role. The attack was claimed by Somali group al Shabaab, an al Qaeda affiliate fighting to topple Somalia’s weak U.N.-backed government and impose strict Islamic law.  Neighbouring Kenya has been a periodic target for al Shabaab after sending troops into Somalia to try to create a buffer zone along the porous border. But robust economic expansion, estimated at 6.0 percent last year, has helped boost investor sentiments, although rising government debt levels have stoked concerns.   Snehar Shah, managing director for East Africa at British solar power firm Azuri Technologies, pointed out that Kenya was not the only country that had suffered attacks.  “We still believe that Nairobi is a hub for the region and we are very committed to being here,” Shah told Reuters. “This is also happening in places like London and it didn’t stop business and tourism.” Google Africa, whose offices are near the hotel complex attacked, echoed his sentiments. “We are here in Kenya for the long haul,” said Dorothy Ooko, their head of communications.  Google lost some of its partners in the attack, including American Jason Spindler, the CEO of investment firm I-Dev International, part of Google’s local start-up and developer network. At the East Africa headquarters of U.S. ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies [UBER.UL], staff were co-ordinating free rides to and from selected Nairobi hospitals for blood donors.  “Uber continues to stand in support of the Nairobi community as we recover from this devastating act,” said their spokesman for East Africa. Such stoicism reflects a realisation that East Africa was not really getting more dangerous, said Ed Hobey-Hamsher, senior Africa analyst at global risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft. “One-off attacks will embarrass the Kenyan government but will not jeopardise its stability,” he said. Kenya has a record of resilience. Its economy recovered strongly from the 1998 bombing by al Qaeda’s East Africa cell of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi which killed more than 200 people. In the important tourism sector, which has attracted a wave of foreign investments recently from global chains like Hyatt Hotels and Accor SA, executives also stood firm. “I don’t see any cancellations and no one has cut short their stay,” said Mohamed Hersi, chairman of the Kenya Tourism Federation, an umbrella body of hoteliers, tour operators and airlines. The industry was encouraged by the swift security response that killed the attackers in less than 24 hours, he said. Earnings from tourism, one of the top sources of foreign exchange, surged 31 percent last year to 157.4 billion shillings (1.21 billion pounds), the tourism ministry said on January 7. The Nairobi Securities Exchange, a gateway for foreign investors into the fast-growing economies of East Africa, said trading had carried on normally on Wednesday. “Despite the efforts by the terrorists to instil fear and destabilise our country, Kenya is a strong and resilient country. Today’s market performance was stable,” the bourse said in a statement.

2019-01-27,"CALAIS, France (Reuters) - Mohamed’s first attempt to reach Britain’s southern shores in December foundered because the outboard engine was not powerful enough to propel the boat carrying him and half a dozen other Iranian migrants through the choppy English Channel. Last year saw a sharp increase in the number of migrants trying to cross the narrow waterway separating mainland Europe and Britain by boat. Most of them were Iranians. Now, French police patrol the sandy beaches near the northern port of Calais every night, searching for migrants gathering to take to the sea. “Everyone can succeed. The police only get us if our engine breaks,” Mohamed told Reuters, declining to reveal his full name. The 38-year-old Iranian Kurd left his wife and children in Tehran over two years ago in search of a more prosperous life in Britain, turning his back on his homeland even before renewed U.S. sanctions began squeezing Iran’s economy. He plans to ask to bring his family over once he reaches Britain. “I’ll try again when I am ready,” he said, adding that he was hunting for a new boat. Calais has long served as a launch pad for migrants targeting Britain, which lies just 21 miles (34 km) away at the closest point - but across one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. A sprawling migrant camp razed by the French government in late 2016 housed thousands of mostly African and Afghani migrants who would try to enter Britain hidden in lorries, trains and ferries. Mohamed is part of a new trend: Iranians crossing by small boats, often rigid inflatables bought online, and sometimes stolen fishing boats. In 2018, 276 people reached Britain, of which the overwhelming majority were Iranians, France’s interior ministry said in early January. Charity workers estimate that some 200 Iranians of different social and economic class are waiting to attempt a crossing. “Since September we’ve been seeing Iranians, who we didn’t see before, and they’re crossing by boats. They are the only ones ready to risk it. It’s probably because of the sanctions,” said Maya Konforti, an official at the local Auberge des Migrants charity, referring to economic sanctions re-imposed on Iran by the United States. Their decision to attempt the crossing comes despite Britain remaining on course to leave the European Union, a move fueled in part by anti-immigration sentiment. Many of Mohamed’s comrades have money. Migrants said that a small group could club together and buy a dinghy and outboard engine for about 5,000 euros (£4,423.17) on websites like Le Bon Coin, a local version of EBay. That price, they said, compared with the roughly 10,000 euros per head price tag demanded by traffickers who prefer to send migrants across by truck and who guarantee success - even if it entails numerous attempts. “Maybe the Europeans are scared of dying, but we know we’ll die one day so perhaps it will be here,” Mohamed said.  President Donald Trump’s decision to pull the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Tehran and re-impose sanctions has hurt Iran’s economy, in particular its oil industry. Its rial currency has fluctuated wildly, making it difficult for people to make ends meet. Truck drivers, farmers, workers, merchants and teachers have led sporadic protests in Iran, resulting in violent confrontations with security forces. The Iranian migrants in Calais are a mixed demographic. One young man showed a photo of himself in a sharp suit at his brother’s wedding. Another took out a picture of himself in full army uniform before he fled the country. The number of Iranians in and around Calais began swelling in late 2017, after Serbia scrapped a visa requirement for Iranian citizens in August that year, opening up an easier route to the European Union. Belgrade scrapped the move 14 months later after 1,100 sought asylum in the country. Others moved on. Despite Britain’s decision to leave the EU, the country fulfils the migrants’ criteria of an Anglophone destination deemed more welcoming than mainland Europe, where they consider themselves unwanted and mistreated. “The danger is not at sea, it is here. At sea it’s over in two minutes, but here everyday it’s finished,” said a second Iranian migrant in his late twenties, bemoaning the French police’s heavy-handed tactics. French authorities say they take a tough approach to discourage people from returning to the northern coast. So far, no migrants have perished crossing the Channel by boat. But local residents fear that may change if the flow of clandestine crossings is not stemmed. “I don’t want the Channel to become a second tomb like the Mediterranean because of the poor management of these people, which forces them to take unnecessary risks,” said Damien Careme, mayor of Grande-Synthe, a town some 40 kilometres west of Calais where 200 migrants are housed in a gymnasium.

2019-01-27,"JARABLUS, Syria (Reuters) - Rebel commander Adnan Abu Faisal and his army are encamped near the frontline in northern Syria, waiting to launch an offensive on his home city of Manbij. But they are not the ones who will decide whether to march on the strategically important city, held for more than two years by Kurdish forces supported by the United States.  The decision will depend on Turkey, the main backer of Abu Faisal’s group, and on how contacts evolve between Washington and Ankara over the United States’ plans to withdraw forces from Syria, a move set to reshape a major theatre of the war. The United States and Turkey are allies both in the NATO defence alliance and in the fight against Islamic State, but Ankara sees the Kurdish YPG forces that helped the U.S.-led coalition drive IS out of Manbij in 2016 as a security threat. The YPG fear the U.S. withdrawal will open the way for a  threatened Turkish attack into northern Syria, including Manbij, but U.S. President Donald Trump has warned Turkey of “economic devastation” if it goes ahead with the attack. Abu Faisal’s fighters are awaiting orders near Jarablus, a town held by Turkey and its Syrian rebel allies about 35 km (22 miles) south of Manbij. The frontline in the area runs through open farmland where wheat and corn are usually grown. “We are ready with our forces ... for ‘zero hour’ to begin any military action,” Abu Faisal, whose forces have more than 300 vehicles including pickup trucks and armoured vehicles provided by Turkey, told Reuters. “Preparations are going at full speed,” he said. Abu Faisal, 36, was an army captain before Syria’s civil war began in 2011 but defected from the Syrian army in 2012 to join the fight against President Bashar al-Assad.  Abu Faisal helped wrest control of Manbij from the Syrian army early in the conflict but fled when it was seized by Islamic State in 2014 and has not set foot there since then. The YPG have also left Manbij but retain influence over the Kurdish-allied groups that hold the city 30 km (20 miles) from the border with Turkey. Manbij lies near the junction of three separate blocks of territory that form spheres of Russian, Turkish and, for now, U.S. influence. The U.S. military pullout will not only leave Kurds exposed to possible confrontation with Turkey but will also open the way for the expansion of Russian and Iranian sway into the areas that U.S. forces will be leaving. The U.S. military deployed into Syria as part of the fight against Islamic State but officials later indicated wider objectives included containing Iran, Assad’s main regional ally. Late last month, the YPG called on Assad’s forces to protect Manbij from attack by Turkey. Syrian government forces, which are backed by Russia, answered the YPG appeal by deploying outside Manbij. Abu Faisal’s rebel fighters, backed by Turkish forces, made their own advance towards the city the same day but stopped short of an attack. Since then, Turkey has been engaged in diplomatic contacts with Washington and Assad’s Russian allies. The Kurds who control swaths of northern Syria have turned to Russia and the Syrian government since Trump’s announcement, hoping to secure a deal that keeps Turkey at bay and preserves their autonomy within a reformed Syrian state. Abu Faisal said “political understandings” would determine whether an attack went ahead, reflecting the influence of foreign powers in the Syrian conflict. A political solution that spared blood would be welcome, he added.  For Abu Faisal, the YPG — People’s Protection Units — is no less of an enemy than IS or Assad. Turkey views the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has waged a 34-year insurgency in Turkey for Kurdish political and cultural rights, mostly in southeastern areas near Syria. A top Kurdish politician told Reuters this month the Kurds had presented Moscow with a road map for a deal with Damascus.. Syria’s deputy foreign minister has said he is optimistic about renewed dialogue with the Kurds. A deal between Damascus and the Kurds would piece back together the two largest chunks of Syria and leave one corner of the northwest under the control of anti-Assad insurgents who have been driven out of many of the areas they once held. Abu Faisal — head of the opposition’s Manbij Military Council in exile — says it would be a catastrophe if Assad were allowed to recover Manbij. He warned this would trigger yet more displacement of civilians fleeing a return of Assad’s rule. His priority is to secure the return home of Manbij residents who have been living either as refugees in Turkey or in nearby areas of northern Syria that are controlled by Turkey and its Syrian allies. “There cannot be acceptance of any political solution or military solution except with the return of these displaced people to their city,” Abu Faisal said.  “Our goal is to reassure the people of Manbij that its people will run the affairs of this city,” he said.

2019-01-27,"PARIS (Reuters) - It would be wrong for Britain to think the European Union will blink on Brexit and make concessions that undermine its core principles, such as the integrity of the single market, an official at the French presidency said on Wednesday. “If there’s an idea going round that the European Union has shown a firm front but in fact is weak and febrile when it comes to its fundamental principles, well that would be wrong,” said the official at President Emmanuel Macron’s office. “Nobody believes it, and I don’t think Theresa May believes it,” the official added, a day after the British prime minister’s deal over the terms for divorce from the bloc was resoundingly defeated by the British parliament. The French official added that any request by Britain to extend article 50 would have to come with a plan, a strategy, that would respect EU principles to be approved by the EU side. “An extension is not a solution in itself, a procedure exists and it must be the consequence of a plan. The work must be done in London in coming days, because it is not Brussels which is blocking things,” he said.  “All the options would be looked at with good will and openness, as long as they respect the main principles of the EU, notably the integrity of the single market,” the official added. The French official also said the wide margin by which the vote in the Commons was lost demonstrated that further political assurances from the EU alone would not be enough to swing a new vote. France’s prime minister will hold a meeting with cabinet ministers on Thursday morning to provide an update on ongoing preparations for a no-deal scenario and speed them up if need be, the official added.

2019-01-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May might have to find an alternative to her Brexit plan in order to break a parliamentary impasse on how to leave the European Union, the leader of May’s Conservative Party in parliament said on Wednesday. “What we need to do is to find a way that (May’s) deal or some part of it or an alternative deal that is negotiable can then be put to the European Union so that we will get this Brexit through by March 29,” Andrea Leadsom told BBC radio. May’s Brexit deal suffered a crushing defeat in parliament on Tuesday, raising the prospect of the government seeking a different plan or leaving the EU with no deal at all. Leadsom said she thought May’s government would survive a confidence vote scheduled for later on Wednesday. “The prime minister will then not necessarily be looking for brand new ideas that no one has thought of before, but actually seeking a consensus, actually a fresh initiative to find a solution that is negotiable with the European Union and that would command a majority in the House of Commons,” she said.

2019-01-27,"PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday Britain would be the biggest loser if it left the European Union without a deal, after the British parliament resoundingly rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit divorce agreement. Macron was reaching the end of an almost seven-hour debate with local officials when he was told of the result of the British vote. “First option, they go towards a no deal. They say: ‘there is no deal’. That’s scary for everybody. The first losers in this would be the British,” Macron told mayors during a town hall meeting in Normandy. “Second option, they tell us - in my view, that’s what they’ll do, I know them a bit - ‘we’ll try to improve what we can get from the Europeans and we’ll get back for a vote’,” Macron said. “In that case, we’ll look into it, maybe we’ll make improvements on one or two things, but I don’t really think so because we’ve reached the maximum of what we could do with the deal and we won’t, just to solve Britain’s domestic political issues, stop defending European interests,” he said. After praising the head of the European Council Donald Tusk and the EU’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, Macron said he expected Britain to eventually ask for more time to renegotiate a deal. “There’s a third option, which is to say - and in my view they’ll start with the second option and then we’ll eventually end up with the third - ‘actually, we’re going to take more time to renegotiate something’,” he said. “It creates a great deal of uncertainty and worries.” Reporting by Michel Rose; Editing by Janet Lawrence",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-macron/macron-britain-would-be-biggest-loser-in-case-of-no-deal-brexit-idUKKCN1P92TT,2019-01-27,"French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday Britain would be the biggest loser if it left the European Union without a deal, after the British parliament resoundingly rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit divorce agreement.",Macron - Britain would be biggest loser in case of no-deal Brexit
