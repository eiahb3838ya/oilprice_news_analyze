2019-01-27,"FRANKFURT, Jan 28 (Reuters) - RWE, Germany’s largest electricity generator, will have to make significant job cuts due to the country’s planned phase-out of coal-fired power plants, details of which were published over the weekend, its CEO told a German paper. Rolf Martin Schmitz told Rheinische Post he could not yet give a specific number. “But I expect a significant reduction already until 2023 which will go far beyond what is planned so far and can be done through normal fluctuations,” he said. Germany should shut down all of its coal-fired power plants by 2038 at the latest, a government-appointed commission said on Saturday, proposing at least 40 billion euros ($45.6 billion) in aid to regions affected by the phase-out. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Sunday the ruling coalition would move quickly to begin implementing the commission’s recommendations. RWE is Germany’s largest operator of coal-fired power plants and employs about 10,000 staff in the Rhenish coal mining area, which also includes power plants. Schmitz said plant staff would be directly affected due to planned shutdowns until 2022, while coal mining jobs would be at risk thereafter. “That needs to happen in a socially responsible way,” he said. $1 = 0.8767 euros

2019-01-27,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Islamic State said it killed 30 Nigerian soldiers in an attack on Saturday in the country’s northeastern Borno state, a claim disputed by the Nigerian Army. A Nigerian Army spokesman said an attack on troops by insurgents in the Borno village of Logomani was repelled on Saturday and eight soldiers were hurt, none with life-threatening injuries. In a statement issued through its news agency Amaq, Islamic State on Sunday claimed responsibility for the attack on a village it referred to as Lomani.

2019-01-27,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s ruling coalition will move quickly to begin implementing the recommendations of a government-appointed commission for exiting coal power by 2038, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told German broadcaster ARD on Sunday. Altmaier, a conservative, said he was in close touch with Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat, about the issue, and some money had already been earmarked in the 2019 budget to get started with various measures.  “We need a whole series of laws”, including one that would secure new jobs and set out plans for closing coal-fired power plants, Altmaier said, promising quick action after a review of a hard-won compromise proposal finalised early on Saturday. The plans call for shutting down the last of Germany’s coal-fired power plants by 2038 at the latest, and providing at least 40 billion euros (34.62 billion pounds) in aid to regions affected by the phase-out. Altmaier said details would still need to be worked after the proposals were reviewed in coming days. Environment Minister Svenja Schulze, a Social Democrat, said exiting coal would send a positive signal internationally, and studies completed by her ministry showed the shift would “by no means lead to higher electricity prices”. Eric Schweitzer, president of Germany’s Chambers of Commerce (DIHK), welcomed the proposals, which must now be implemented by the German government and 16 regional states, but said they could drive electricity costs higher. Christian Lindner, leader of the pro-business Free Democrats, said the exit from coal production was already in the offing due to climate change targets, and the commission’s plan would further inflate already high German energy prices. “There was absolutely no need to think about an exit from coal with a fixed end-date. It was coming anyway,” he said.   He said it would be far more efficient and economical to use carbon offsets to regulate emissions from the energy and transportation sectors. The coal commission proposed that an independent panel assess the announced measures in 2023, 2026 and 2029 to see whether they were delivering in the intended results with regard to jobs, security of supply and prices.    Schulze said regions that now produced coal would remain important players in the German energy market through investment in new technologies, renewables, and climate protection. The proposals embody Germany’s strategy of shifting to renewable sources of energy — which made up more than 40 percent of the energy mix last year, beating coal for the first time — and follow a 2011 decision to halt nuclear power.

2019-01-27,"RABAT (Reuters) - The Climate Investment Funds (CIF) plans to raise $500 million this year or next by issuing a green bond to finance renewable energy projects, the organization’s head said on Sunday.  The $8 billion fund gets most of its money from development banks and donor countries and finances more than 300 environmentally-friendly energy projects in some 72 countries. “U.S, European and Japanese investors are interested in green bond offerings,” Mafalda Duarte said in a phone interview,  without giving further details on where the CIF plans to issue the green bond. Green bonds are fixed income securities that raise capital for projects with environmental benefits.  The CIF will use the proceeds to fund projects that could range from promoting the transition to renewable energy and improving resilience to climate change to stabilizing power grids amid the growing use of intermittent sources of power.  The CIF also sees opportunities in electrified transport, Mafalda said.  She also stressed the need to cut the cost of concentrated solar power technology, which uses mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight, and to promote the integration of regional energy markets. Such issues will be examined at a conference on Jan. 28-29 marking the CIF’s tenth anniversary.  The conference will be held in the south-eastern Moroccan city of Ouarzazate, where the CIF contributed $535 million to building a 580 megawatt (MW) solar power plant, the world’s largest.

2019-01-27,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq must wean itself off economic reliance on Iran and become more energy self-sufficient, Britain’s foreign office minister for the Middle East said on Sunday. Alistair Burt visited Iraq after a flurry of high-profile diplomacy in Baghdad this month that followed U.S. President Donald Trump’s surprise announcement he was pulling American troops out of Syria. U.S. allies worry the withdrawal, even if it proceeds more slowly than initially planned, will embolden Iran, whose influence has grown in Iraq and Syria in recent years. Washington hopes to counter Iranian influence through renewed sanctions, and has pressured Iraq to halt imports of Iranian gas. “To expect Iran to have no influence in Iraq is fanciful,” Burt said in an interview with Reuters at the British Embassy in Baghdad. “What is important is that Iraq finds the opportunity to follow its own future in terms of foreign relations and that its economy is strong, and isn’t reliant on Iran.” Burt said Iraq must convert oil resources to become more self-sufficient. “The sooner all its oil wealth can come on stream and can capture all the energy that is sometimes not used as effectively as possible ... the better,” he said. Iraq’s oil export capacity is nearly 5 million barrels per day, although it is pumping below capacity in line with an OPEC agreement to reduce production to stabilise prices. Washington hopes it can reduce its gas flaring to satisfy domestic energy needs and rely less on Iranian power imports. Burt said there were ideas for more power projects in Iraq, without elaborating. U.S.-IRAN TENSIONS MOUNT He doubted that a military escalation between the United States and Iran in Iraq or Syria was imminent, but warned of “confrontation which might occur should there be a miscalculation.” Tension has ramped up between Washington’s chief regional ally Israel, and Iran and its allies in Syria and Iraq in recent weeks. Israel struck what it said were Iranian targets near Damascus on Monday in an increasingly open assault on Iran’s presence there. Burt said Britain remained concerned about the threat from Islamic State in the region especially after the U.S. decision to withdraw troops, and that London would continue to support Baghdad’s efforts against remaining IS militants who have stepped up insurgent-style attacks in Iraq.

2019-01-27,"LAGOS, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The Nigerian government said it would not accept any foreign “meddling” after the European Union, United States and Britain raised concerns over last week’s suspension of Nigeria’s most senior judge before a Feb. 16 presidential election. President Muhammadu Buhari, who is seeking a second term in office, suspended Chief Justice Walter Onnoghen on Friday over allegedly breaching asset-declaration rules, drawing criticism at home and abroad. The opposition called it an act of dictatorship and halted its election campaign for 72 hours in protest. The EU election observation team said Onnoghen’s suspension raised concerns about the “opportunity for electoral justice”. “FG [federal government] determined to ensure free, fair elections. This government will not bend the rules, and will not allow meddling in our affairs,” read a statement issued late on Saturday by Buhari’s spokesman, Garba Shehu. Coming hours after statements expressing concern were issued by the E.U., U.S. and Britain, the statement said the government would “reject any interference or perception management that promotes apprehension” about the outcome of the election. Onnoghen has not responded to the charges and his lawyers say the tribunal does not have the authority to try him. Buhari, who took office in 2015 after winning an election largely on his vow to fight corruption and improve security, is a retired general who was a military ruler in the 1980s.

2019-01-27,"ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Italy’s Eni and Austria’s OMV have agreed to  pay a combined $5.8 billion to take a stake in Abu Dhabi National Oil Company’s (ADNOC) refining business and establish a new trading operation owned by the three partners. The transaction, which expands ADNOC’s access to European markets, furthers Eni’s diversification away from Africa and gives OMV a downstream oil business outside Europe. It was hailed as a “one of a kind” deal by ADNOC’s Chief Executive Sultan al-Jaber. “The whole oil and gas industry hasn’t seen a transaction of this size and sophistication,” he said.   Under the agreement, Eni and OMV will acquire a 20 percent and a 15 percent share in ADNOC Refining respectively, with ADNOC owning the remaining 65 percent, the three companies said in statements on Sunday.   The partners will own the same proportions of the joint trading venture, they added.   OMV said that it would pay around $2.5 billion, while Eni said it would pay around $3.3 billion, giving ADNOC Refining, which has a total refining capacity of 922,000 barrels per day, an enterprise value of $19.3 billion. The agreement includes output from the Ruwais Refinery, the fourth largest single site refinery in the world.  The new trading venture will expand market access for ADNOC Refining’s products with export volumes equivalent to approximately 70 percent of throughput.  “We are already well-positioned in Asia and we want to increase our market share there .... but this will also help us to have access to European markets and beyond,” al-Jaber said.  Eni has signed several deals in the Middle East in recent months as it expands outside Africa where it is the biggest foreign oil and gas producer. The company’s CEO Claudio Descalzi said the partnership would increase its global refining capacity by 35 percent.  “This transaction, which allows us to enter the United Arab Emirates’ downstream sector...(will make) Eni’s overall portfolio more geographically diversified, more balanced along the value chain, more efficient and more resilient to cope with market volatility,” he said.  OMV described the deal, which is set to close in the third quarter of 2019, as a major milestone in relation to its “Strategy 2025” plan. It said it would finance the deal primarily out of its cash flow.  “With (this transaction) OMV has established a strong integrated position in Abu Dhabi...spanning from upstream production to refining & trading and petrochemicals,” CEO Rainer Seele said. Founded in 1971, ADNOC has undergone major change since al-Jaber’s appointment in 2016, part of wider economic reforms led by Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who witnessed the signing of the three-way agreement.  Al-Jaber has embarked on privatizing its services businesses, ventured into oil trading and expanded partnerships with strategic investors.

2019-01-27,"(Reuters) - Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) expects to face challenges this year due to uncertainty over the impact of a global trade war on the United States and  China, its major markets, the company’s chief executive said on Sunday. However, the world’s fourth-biggest petrochemicals company said it has the ability to deal with such challenges and started to see stabilization in prices of some products after a steep decline toward the end of 2018. SABIC reported a 12.4 percent drop in fourth-quarter profit compared to the year earlier period, missing analyst forecasts. The company attributed the fall to lower average selling prices and a decrease in the share of results of associates. “We’ve seen stabilization for some of the prices, still there are some challenges ahead of us,” Chief Executive Yousef al-Benyan told a news conference in the Saudi capital. SABIC will continue to boost its presence in its major markets — the U.S. and China, he added. “We are part of the global economic system, we are always affected by challenges but we are able to adapt with these challenges in the best way.” He said SABIC will continue to raise its presence in Africa, as it is seen a very promising market. SABIC’s biggest shareholder, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), is in talks to sell its majority stake to Saudi national oil giant Aramco. Benyan said he views Aramco’s move to “positively”, but further details are a matter for PIF and Aramco, which aims to become a global leader in chemicals. He added the company will determine later if it needs to increase its 24.99 percent stake in Switzerland’s Clariant after the two companies decided to merge their high-performance materials businesses. SABIC made a net profit of 3.24 billion riyals ($864 million) in the three months to Dec. 31, down from 3.7 billion riyals in the year-earlier period, the company said in a statement to the stock exchange. That was lower than the average forecast of three analysts polled by Refinitiv, who expected SABIC to post a net profit of 4.92 billion riyals. Shares of SABIC were trading 0.3 percent higher in late morning trade, recovering earlier losses.  SABIC results are closely tied to oil prices and global economic growth because its products - plastics, fertilisers and metals - are used extensively in construction, agriculture, industry and the manufacturing of consumer goods. In 2018, U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI)futures slumped nearly 25 percent, while Brent tumbled more than 19.5 percent.

2019-01-27,"UNITED NATIONS/CARACAS (Reuters) - The United States on Saturday called on the world to “pick a side” on Venezuela and urged countries to financially disconnect from Nicolas Maduro’s government, while European powers signalled they were set to follow Washington in recognising Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country’s rightful leader. In heated back-and-forth exchanges at a United Nations Security Council meeting, the opposing camp led by Venezuela and Russia, which has invested heavily in Venezuela’s oil industry, accused Washington of attempting a coup, and lambasted Europeans’ demand that elections be called within eight days. Guaido, who took the helm of the National Assembly on Jan. 5, proclaimed himself interim president on Wednesday. The United States, Canada and a string of Latin American countries recognised the young leader in quick succession. Maduro, who has led the oil-rich nation since 2013 and has the support of the armed forces, has refused to stand down. But on Saturday Guaido, 35, gained support from a key military official. Venezuela’s defence attache to Washington, Colonel Jose Luis Silva, told Reuters that he has broken with the Maduro government and recognised Guaido as interim president.    Speaking at the U.N. meeting, called by the United States, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Maduro’s “socialist experiment” had caused the economy to collapse and reduced ordinary Venezuelans to rooting through dumpsters for food. “Now it is time for every other nation to pick a side. ... Either you stand with the forces of freedom, or you’re in league with Maduro and his mayhem,” Pompeo told the council. “We call on all members of the Security Council to support Venezuela’s democratic transition and interim President Guaido’s role.” Pompeo also called on the international community to disconnect their financial systems from Maduro’s government. Washington has signalled it was ready to step up economic measures to try to drive Maduro from power, but on Saturday Pompeo declined to elaborate on any such plans. By overcoming opposition to holding the U.N. meeting on Saturday, Washington successfully put the global spotlight on Venezuela as a Security Council problem. However, any council action to address the crisis would be blocked by veto-powers Russia and China, diplomats said. Britain, Germany, France and Spain all said on Saturday they would recognise Guaido if Maduro failed to call fresh elections within eight days, an ultimatum Russia said was “absurd” and the Venezuelan foreign minister called “childlike.” “Europe is giving us eight days? Where do you get that you have the power to establish a deadline or an ultimatum to a sovereign people?” Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told the Security Council.  Russia also said military intervention in Venezuela should be avoided at any cost, while Caracas reiterated that its offer of dialogue with President Donald Trump’s government was still on the table despite his administration’s two-year campaign against Maduro. “If President Trump, like other presidents of the United States, is in search of war to show he can govern and to stimulate the economy, he won’t get that war in Venezuela,” Arreaza told reporters later. Venezuela has sunk into turmoil under Maduro with food shortages and protests amid an economic and political crisis that has sparked mass emigration and inflation that is seen rising to 10 million percent this year. Maduro cruised to re-election last May. The opposition largely boycotted the vote after its senior leaders were blocked from taking part. Critics accused the government of vote buying. The domestic opposition, the United States and right-leaning Latin American governments declined to recognise the result of the ballot. Venezuelan opposition sympathizers had been urging Guaido to assume the presidency since Maduro was inaugurated for a second term on Jan. 10. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets in Caracas earlier this week, calling on Maduro to step down. Guaido’s declaration of himself as the interim president takes Venezuela into uncharted territory, with the possibility of the opposition now running a parallel government recognised abroad as legitimate but without control over state functions. After the Security Council debate, Guaido sent a letter to Secretary General Antonio Guterres asking the United Nations for help addressing hunger, violence and the lack of medicines in his country.  The United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. Guaido celebrated the support of European countries and also asked them to send humanitarian aid to help relieve the economic crisis. “We woke up today with nothing less than the full support of the European community,” Guaido said at a small political event in a square in the capital Caracas. “Several European countries have been in touch with us and are going to support the entry of humanitarian aid. ... We continue adding countries to this great effort,” he said. The Maduro government has previously rejected such aid, denying there is a humanitarian crisis in the country and blaming economic problems on sanctions. After Washington’s declaration of support for Guaido, Maduro cut off diplomatic relations with the United States on Wednesday and gave U.S. diplomats 72 hours to leave the country.  Some U.S. embassy staff left Caracas on Friday, and Venezuela was withdrawing staff from Washington on Saturday, Venezuela’s foreign ministry said in a statement However, Maduro softened his demand that all U.S. embassy staff withdraw by Saturday. Instead, the two countries will seek an agreement to replace the embassies with “Interest Offices” in their respective capitals within 30 days, the statement said. If that fails, the missions would close.

2019-01-27,"BERLIN, Jan 27 (Reuters) - German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said exiting coal as an energy source would send a positive signal internationally, and need not necessarily drive German energy prices higher. Schulze told the Funke Mediengruppe newspaper chain she was satisfied with the work of a government-appointed commission, which on Saturday proposed shutting down the last of Germany’s coal-fired power plants by 2038 at the latest. A member of the Social Democrats, junior partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling coalition, Schulze said she had not studied the commission’s recommendations in detail, but studies conducted by her ministry had shown than exiting coal would “by no means lead to higher electricity prices.” “I am convinced that a strong industrial country like Germany can master the energy revolution and become stronger and more modern in the process,” she added. She said regions that now produced coal would remain important players in the German energy market through investment in new technologies, renewables, and climate protection. A government-appointed commission on Saturday proposed providing at least 40 billion euros ($45.7 billion) in aid to regions affected by the phase-out. The proposals must now be implemented by the German government and 16 regional states. They embody Germany’s strategy to shift to renewable energy, which made up more than 40 percent of the energy mix last year — beating coal for the first time — and follow a 2011 decision to halt nuclear power.

2019-01-27,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s ruling coalition will move quickly to begin implementing the recommendations of a government-appointed commission for exiting coal power by 2038, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told German broadcaster ARD on Sunday. Altmaier, a conservative, said he was in close touch with Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat, about the issue, and some money had already been earmarked in the 2019 budget to get started with various measures.  “We need a whole series of laws”, including one that would secure new jobs and set out plans for closing coal-fired power plants, Altmaier said, promising quick action after a review of a hard-won compromise proposal finalised early on Saturday. The plans call for shutting down the last of Germany’s coal-fired power plants by 2038 at the latest, and providing at least 40 billion euros (34.62 billion pounds) in aid to regions affected by the phase-out. Altmaier said details would still need to be worked after the proposals were reviewed in coming days. Environment Minister Svenja Schulze, a Social Democrat, said exiting coal would send a positive signal internationally, and studies completed by her ministry showed the shift would “by no means lead to higher electricity prices”. Eric Schweitzer, president of Germany’s Chambers of Commerce (DIHK), welcomed the proposals, which must now be implemented by the German government and 16 regional states, but said they could drive electricity costs higher. Christian Lindner, leader of the pro-business Free Democrats, said the exit from coal production was already in the offing due to climate change targets, and the commission’s plan would further inflate already high German energy prices. “There was absolutely no need to think about an exit from coal with a fixed end-date. It was coming anyway,” he said.   He said it would be far more efficient and economical to use carbon offsets to regulate emissions from the energy and transportation sectors. The coal commission proposed that an independent panel assess the announced measures in 2023, 2026 and 2029 to see whether they were delivering in the intended results with regard to jobs, security of supply and prices.    Schulze said regions that now produced coal would remain important players in the German energy market through investment in new technologies, renewables, and climate protection. The proposals embody Germany’s strategy of shifting to renewable sources of energy — which made up more than 40 percent of the energy mix last year, beating coal for the first time — and follow a 2011 decision to halt nuclear power.

2019-01-27,"RABAT (Reuters) - The Climate Investment Funds (CIF) plans to raise $500 million this year or next by issuing a green bond to finance renewable energy projects, the organization’s head said on Sunday.  The $8 billion fund gets most of its money from development banks and donor countries and finances more than 300 environmentally-friendly energy projects in some 72 countries. “U.S, European and Japanese investors are interested in green bond offerings,” Mafalda Duarte said in a phone interview,  without giving further details on where the CIF plans to issue the green bond. Green bonds are fixed income securities that raise capital for projects with environmental benefits.  The CIF will use the proceeds to fund projects that could range from promoting the transition to renewable energy and improving resilience to climate change to stabilizing power grids amid the growing use of intermittent sources of power.  The CIF also sees opportunities in electrified transport, Mafalda said.  She also stressed the need to cut the cost of concentrated solar power technology, which uses mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight, and to promote the integration of regional energy markets. Such issues will be examined at a conference on Jan. 28-29 marking the CIF’s tenth anniversary.  The conference will be held in the south-eastern Moroccan city of Ouarzazate, where the CIF contributed $535 million to building a 580 megawatt (MW) solar power plant, the world’s largest.

2019-01-27,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq must wean itself off economic reliance on Iran and become more energy self-sufficient, Britain’s foreign office minister for the Middle East said on Sunday. Alistair Burt visited Iraq after a flurry of high-profile diplomacy in Baghdad this month that followed U.S. President Donald Trump’s surprise announcement he was pulling American troops out of Syria. U.S. allies worry the withdrawal, even if it proceeds more slowly than initially planned, will embolden Iran, whose influence has grown in Iraq and Syria in recent years. Washington hopes to counter Iranian influence through renewed sanctions, and has pressured Iraq to halt imports of Iranian gas. “To expect Iran to have no influence in Iraq is fanciful,” Burt said in an interview with Reuters at the British Embassy in Baghdad. “What is important is that Iraq finds the opportunity to follow its own future in terms of foreign relations and that its economy is strong, and isn’t reliant on Iran.” Burt said Iraq must convert oil resources to become more self-sufficient. “The sooner all its oil wealth can come on stream and can capture all the energy that is sometimes not used as effectively as possible ... the better,” he said. Iraq’s oil export capacity is nearly 5 million barrels per day, although it is pumping below capacity in line with an OPEC agreement to reduce production to stabilise prices. Washington hopes it can reduce its gas flaring to satisfy domestic energy needs and rely less on Iranian power imports. Burt said there were ideas for more power projects in Iraq, without elaborating. U.S.-IRAN TENSIONS MOUNT He doubted that a military escalation between the United States and Iran in Iraq or Syria was imminent, but warned of “confrontation which might occur should there be a miscalculation.” Tension has ramped up between Washington’s chief regional ally Israel, and Iran and its allies in Syria and Iraq in recent weeks. Israel struck what it said were Iranian targets near Damascus on Monday in an increasingly open assault on Iran’s presence there. Burt said Britain remained concerned about the threat from Islamic State in the region especially after the U.S. decision to withdraw troops, and that London would continue to support Baghdad’s efforts against remaining IS militants who have stepped up insurgent-style attacks in Iraq.

2019-01-27,"LAGOS, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The Nigerian government said it would not accept any foreign “meddling” after the European Union, United States and Britain raised concerns over last week’s suspension of Nigeria’s most senior judge before a Feb. 16 presidential election. President Muhammadu Buhari, who is seeking a second term in office, suspended Chief Justice Walter Onnoghen on Friday over allegedly breaching asset-declaration rules, drawing criticism at home and abroad. The opposition called it an act of dictatorship and halted its election campaign for 72 hours in protest. The EU election observation team said Onnoghen’s suspension raised concerns about the “opportunity for electoral justice”. “FG [federal government] determined to ensure free, fair elections. This government will not bend the rules, and will not allow meddling in our affairs,” read a statement issued late on Saturday by Buhari’s spokesman, Garba Shehu. Coming hours after statements expressing concern were issued by the E.U., U.S. and Britain, the statement said the government would “reject any interference or perception management that promotes apprehension” about the outcome of the election. Onnoghen has not responded to the charges and his lawyers say the tribunal does not have the authority to try him. Buhari, who took office in 2015 after winning an election largely on his vow to fight corruption and improve security, is a retired general who was a military ruler in the 1980s.

2019-01-27,"ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Italy’s Eni and Austria’s OMV have agreed to  pay a combined $5.8 billion to take a stake in Abu Dhabi National Oil Company’s (ADNOC) refining business and establish a new trading operation owned by the three partners. The transaction, which expands ADNOC’s access to European markets, furthers Eni’s diversification away from Africa and gives OMV a downstream oil business outside Europe. It was hailed as a “one of a kind” deal by ADNOC’s Chief Executive Sultan al-Jaber. “The whole oil and gas industry hasn’t seen a transaction of this size and sophistication,” he said.   Under the agreement, Eni and OMV will acquire a 20 percent and a 15 percent share in ADNOC Refining respectively, with ADNOC owning the remaining 65 percent, the three companies said in statements on Sunday.   The partners will own the same proportions of the joint trading venture, they added.   OMV said that it would pay around $2.5 billion, while Eni said it would pay around $3.3 billion, giving ADNOC Refining, which has a total refining capacity of 922,000 barrels per day, an enterprise value of $19.3 billion. The agreement includes output from the Ruwais Refinery, the fourth largest single site refinery in the world.  The new trading venture will expand market access for ADNOC Refining’s products with export volumes equivalent to approximately 70 percent of throughput.  “We are already well-positioned in Asia and we want to increase our market share there .... but this will also help us to have access to European markets and beyond,” al-Jaber said.  Eni has signed several deals in the Middle East in recent months as it expands outside Africa where it is the biggest foreign oil and gas producer. The company’s CEO Claudio Descalzi said the partnership would increase its global refining capacity by 35 percent.  “This transaction, which allows us to enter the United Arab Emirates’ downstream sector...(will make) Eni’s overall portfolio more geographically diversified, more balanced along the value chain, more efficient and more resilient to cope with market volatility,” he said.  OMV described the deal, which is set to close in the third quarter of 2019, as a major milestone in relation to its “Strategy 2025” plan. It said it would finance the deal primarily out of its cash flow.  “With (this transaction) OMV has established a strong integrated position in Abu Dhabi...spanning from upstream production to refining & trading and petrochemicals,” CEO Rainer Seele said. Founded in 1971, ADNOC has undergone major change since al-Jaber’s appointment in 2016, part of wider economic reforms led by Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who witnessed the signing of the three-way agreement.  Al-Jaber has embarked on privatizing its services businesses, ventured into oil trading and expanded partnerships with strategic investors.

2019-01-27,"(Reuters) - Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) expects to face challenges this year due to uncertainty over the impact of a global trade war on the United States and  China, its major markets, the company’s chief executive said on Sunday. However, the world’s fourth-biggest petrochemicals company said it has the ability to deal with such challenges and started to see stabilization in prices of some products after a steep decline toward the end of 2018. SABIC reported a 12.4 percent drop in fourth-quarter profit compared to the year earlier period, missing analyst forecasts. The company attributed the fall to lower average selling prices and a decrease in the share of results of associates. “We’ve seen stabilization for some of the prices, still there are some challenges ahead of us,” Chief Executive Yousef al-Benyan told a news conference in the Saudi capital. SABIC will continue to boost its presence in its major markets — the U.S. and China, he added. “We are part of the global economic system, we are always affected by challenges but we are able to adapt with these challenges in the best way.” He said SABIC will continue to raise its presence in Africa, as it is seen a very promising market. SABIC’s biggest shareholder, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), is in talks to sell its majority stake to Saudi national oil giant Aramco. Benyan said he views Aramco’s move to “positively”, but further details are a matter for PIF and Aramco, which aims to become a global leader in chemicals. He added the company will determine later if it needs to increase its 24.99 percent stake in Switzerland’s Clariant after the two companies decided to merge their high-performance materials businesses. SABIC made a net profit of 3.24 billion riyals ($864 million) in the three months to Dec. 31, down from 3.7 billion riyals in the year-earlier period, the company said in a statement to the stock exchange. That was lower than the average forecast of three analysts polled by Refinitiv, who expected SABIC to post a net profit of 4.92 billion riyals. Shares of SABIC were trading 0.3 percent higher in late morning trade, recovering earlier losses.  SABIC results are closely tied to oil prices and global economic growth because its products - plastics, fertilisers and metals - are used extensively in construction, agriculture, industry and the manufacturing of consumer goods. In 2018, U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI)futures slumped nearly 25 percent, while Brent tumbled more than 19.5 percent.

2019-01-27,"UNITED NATIONS/CARACAS (Reuters) - The United States on Saturday called on the world to “pick a side” on Venezuela and urged countries to financially disconnect from Nicolas Maduro’s government, while European powers signalled they were set to follow Washington in recognising Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country’s rightful leader. In heated back-and-forth exchanges at a United Nations Security Council meeting, the opposing camp led by Venezuela and Russia, which has invested heavily in Venezuela’s oil industry, accused Washington of attempting a coup, and lambasted Europeans’ demand that elections be called within eight days. Guaido, who took the helm of the National Assembly on Jan. 5, proclaimed himself interim president on Wednesday. The United States, Canada and a string of Latin American countries recognised the young leader in quick succession. Maduro, who has led the oil-rich nation since 2013 and has the support of the armed forces, has refused to stand down. But on Saturday Guaido, 35, gained support from a key military official. Venezuela’s defence attache to Washington, Colonel Jose Luis Silva, told Reuters that he has broken with the Maduro government and recognised Guaido as interim president.    Speaking at the U.N. meeting, called by the United States, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Maduro’s “socialist experiment” had caused the economy to collapse and reduced ordinary Venezuelans to rooting through dumpsters for food. “Now it is time for every other nation to pick a side. ... Either you stand with the forces of freedom, or you’re in league with Maduro and his mayhem,” Pompeo told the council. “We call on all members of the Security Council to support Venezuela’s democratic transition and interim President Guaido’s role.” Pompeo also called on the international community to disconnect their financial systems from Maduro’s government. Washington has signalled it was ready to step up economic measures to try to drive Maduro from power, but on Saturday Pompeo declined to elaborate on any such plans. By overcoming opposition to holding the U.N. meeting on Saturday, Washington successfully put the global spotlight on Venezuela as a Security Council problem. However, any council action to address the crisis would be blocked by veto-powers Russia and China, diplomats said. Britain, Germany, France and Spain all said on Saturday they would recognise Guaido if Maduro failed to call fresh elections within eight days, an ultimatum Russia said was “absurd” and the Venezuelan foreign minister called “childlike.” “Europe is giving us eight days? Where do you get that you have the power to establish a deadline or an ultimatum to a sovereign people?” Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told the Security Council.  Russia also said military intervention in Venezuela should be avoided at any cost, while Caracas reiterated that its offer of dialogue with President Donald Trump’s government was still on the table despite his administration’s two-year campaign against Maduro. “If President Trump, like other presidents of the United States, is in search of war to show he can govern and to stimulate the economy, he won’t get that war in Venezuela,” Arreaza told reporters later. Venezuela has sunk into turmoil under Maduro with food shortages and protests amid an economic and political crisis that has sparked mass emigration and inflation that is seen rising to 10 million percent this year. Maduro cruised to re-election last May. The opposition largely boycotted the vote after its senior leaders were blocked from taking part. Critics accused the government of vote buying. The domestic opposition, the United States and right-leaning Latin American governments declined to recognise the result of the ballot. Venezuelan opposition sympathizers had been urging Guaido to assume the presidency since Maduro was inaugurated for a second term on Jan. 10. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets in Caracas earlier this week, calling on Maduro to step down. Guaido’s declaration of himself as the interim president takes Venezuela into uncharted territory, with the possibility of the opposition now running a parallel government recognised abroad as legitimate but without control over state functions. After the Security Council debate, Guaido sent a letter to Secretary General Antonio Guterres asking the United Nations for help addressing hunger, violence and the lack of medicines in his country.  The United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. Guaido celebrated the support of European countries and also asked them to send humanitarian aid to help relieve the economic crisis. “We woke up today with nothing less than the full support of the European community,” Guaido said at a small political event in a square in the capital Caracas. “Several European countries have been in touch with us and are going to support the entry of humanitarian aid. ... We continue adding countries to this great effort,” he said. The Maduro government has previously rejected such aid, denying there is a humanitarian crisis in the country and blaming economic problems on sanctions. After Washington’s declaration of support for Guaido, Maduro cut off diplomatic relations with the United States on Wednesday and gave U.S. diplomats 72 hours to leave the country.  Some U.S. embassy staff left Caracas on Friday, and Venezuela was withdrawing staff from Washington on Saturday, Venezuela’s foreign ministry said in a statement However, Maduro softened his demand that all U.S. embassy staff withdraw by Saturday. Instead, the two countries will seek an agreement to replace the embassies with “Interest Offices” in their respective capitals within 30 days, the statement said. If that fails, the missions would close.

2019-01-27,"BERLIN, Jan 27 (Reuters) - German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said exiting coal as an energy source would send a positive signal internationally, and need not necessarily drive German energy prices higher. Schulze told the Funke Mediengruppe newspaper chain she was satisfied with the work of a government-appointed commission, which on Saturday proposed shutting down the last of Germany’s coal-fired power plants by 2038 at the latest. A member of the Social Democrats, junior partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling coalition, Schulze said she had not studied the commission’s recommendations in detail, but studies conducted by her ministry had shown than exiting coal would “by no means lead to higher electricity prices.” “I am convinced that a strong industrial country like Germany can master the energy revolution and become stronger and more modern in the process,” she added. She said regions that now produced coal would remain important players in the German energy market through investment in new technologies, renewables, and climate protection. A government-appointed commission on Saturday proposed providing at least 40 billion euros ($45.7 billion) in aid to regions affected by the phase-out. The proposals must now be implemented by the German government and 16 regional states. They embody Germany’s strategy to shift to renewable energy, which made up more than 40 percent of the energy mix last year — beating coal for the first time — and follow a 2011 decision to halt nuclear power.
