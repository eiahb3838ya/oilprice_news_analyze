2018-04-06,"BRASILIA, April 6 (Reuters) - Brazil has proposed that China introduce a quota for imports of Brazilian sugar that would face a 50 percent levy to solve a trade spat between both countries but China is resisting the plan, a person close to the negotiations told Reuters on Friday. The move is likely to extend a dispute that has curbed exports at the world’s top producer at a time when a mounting global surplus hammers prices. China currently allows 1.94 million tonnes of total sugar imports a year at a tariff of 15 percent as part of its commitment to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Imports beyond that level face a 50 percent levy. Last May, China introduced an additional 45 percent duty on imports from several countries, including top growers such as Brazil and Thailand, to protect its industry from what it identified as a surge in imports. At the time, Brazil’s sugercane industry said the duty, amounting in some cases to 95 percent, was unjustified. Eduardo Leão, the director for industry group Unica, said on May 22 that the so-called safeguards could reduce Brazilian sales to China by 800,000 tonnes in the following 12 months. He said Brazil could ask the WTO to open a panel to evaluate the issue if talks with Beijing are not satisfactory. Brazil has since proposed that a limited amount of Brazilian shipments be exempted from the extra levy, the source said, requesting anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. China has resisted the plan but there has yet been no formal request for action at the WTO level, the source added. Brazil used to be the largest exporter of sugar to China, accounting for roughly 50 percent of a market estimated by Unica at around 6 million tonnes per year. Brazilian sugar exports to China fell from 2.15 million tonnes in the 2016/17 crop year to only 115,000 tonnes in 2017/18, according to figures from Unica, as a result of the safeguard. In a recent statement, Unica said the measure is leading to widespread smuggling of sugar into China, already reaching some 2 million tonnes.

2018-04-06,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt held 25-times more meetings with industry representatives than environmental advocates during his first seven months in office, according to a Reuters analysis of his schedule, reflecting the agency’s pro-business approach under his tenure. The newly released record of Pruitt’s schedule, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by the Environmental Integrity Project watchdog group, come as the White House probes allegations against Pruitt. These include his rental of a room in a Washington, D.C. condo owned by the wife of an energy industry lobbyist. The pressure mounted late on Friday as 64 Democratic members of the 435-member House of Representatives called for President Donald Trump to immediately dismiss him over a host of ethics issues and for acting to counter the mission of his agency. Three fellow Republicans in the House have also called on Pruitt to resign, but the EPA chief has widespread support from conservatives. Pruitt, a vocal doubter of mainstream climate change science, has also faced criticism for frequent first-class air travel, spending on costly items in his office - including a $43,000 soundproof telephone booth - and a trip to Morocco where he promoted U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas, something outside the remit of an environmental regulator. President Donald Trump has praised Pruitt for aggressively pursuing his agenda to roll back regulations he sees as unnecessary to pave the way for more oil, gas, and coal production as well as removing environmental hurdles to a revival in domestic manufacturing.  Trump on Thursday said Pruitt was doing a “fantastic job,” and was well-loved in “coal and energy country.” While Trump appears to support Pruitt, the president can change his mind quickly.  Last autumn, Trump said he had confidence in Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, even after their relationship was strained over Iran and Russia policy. Trump fired Tillerson last month. Trump’s Chief of Staff John Kelly had advocated last week for Trump to fire Pruitt, a White House official said. Trump met with Pruitt early on Friday, said the same official, who declined to say what the meeting concerned.  According to the calendar, Pruitt met with representatives of the industries EPA regulates at least 105 times from Feb. 22 to Aug. 10 of last year, making up about 77 percent of his total meetings during that period.  About half of those industry meetings were with representatives of the oil, gas, coal and mining industries, according to the records, including executives from companies such as oil major BP Plc (BP.L), refiner Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N), coal producer Murray Energy and miner BHP Billiton BLT.L.  Most of the rest of Pruitt’s industry meetings were with representatives of agriculture, including farm groups like the National Cattlemen’s Association, and biofuels producers like Growth Energy and POET, according to the records. But Pruitt met only four times with environmental groups eager to see the EPA limit pollution from those industries, the records show - Trout Unlimited, the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a nonprofit association of state environmental agency leaders called ECOS, and the Alliance to Restore Our Waterways. Past EPA administrators have been criticized by conservatives for spending too much time with environmental lobbying groups and too little with industry. Pruitt, a former attorney general of Oklahoma, said through a spokesman that he does not spend any time with polluters. “I prosecute polluters. What I’m spending time with are stakeholders who care about outcomes,” he said. “It’s Washington, D.C.-think to look at folks across the country - from states to citizens to farmers and ranchers, industry in general - and say they are evil or wrong and we’re not going to partner with them,” Pruitt said. Liz Purchia Gannon, a spokeswoman for former EPA administrator Gina McCarthy, who served under Democratic President Barack Obama, said the ratio of Pruitt’s industry to environmental group meetings was a contrast to the ratio of meetings McCarthy held. McCarthy met frequently with utility groups while the agency worked to form the Clean Power Plan, Obama’s top proposal to curb greenhouse gas emissions, Gannon said.  “As head of EPA she always met with environmental and public health groups and industry and business leaders. She believed strongly in meeting regularly with all sides,” said Gannon, who did not provide data on the meetings.  Pruitt also held a number of meetings with conservative policy think tanks like the Heritage Foundation, and the Family Research Council, a religious group that argues that homosexual conduct is harmful to society, according to the records.  A portion of Pruitt’s schedule covering his first few months in office had already been released by the EPA, but the latest batch covers the broadest period so far.

2018-04-06,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell about 2 percent on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on China, reigniting fears of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies that could hurt global growth. Trump said on Thursday he had ordered U.S. trade officials to consider tariffs on an extra $100 billion of imports from China, escalating tensions with Beijing. China warned on Friday it was fully prepared to respond with a “fierce counter strike” of fresh trade measures if the United States follows through on Trump’s threat. “The heightened possibility of an outright tariff war is conjuring up images of slowed economic growth that could curtail the strong oil demand that has helped to revive a strong pricing environment during the past couple of months,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. Brent crude futures settled down $1.22 at $67.11 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell $1.48 to $62.06 a barrel, a 2.3 percent loss. Brent crude dropped 2.8 percent in the week while U.S. crude fell 4.4 percent, the biggest weekly decline since early February.  U.S. stock indexes also fell on trade war jitters, which weighed on oil prices. Crude futures have recently tracked with equities. OPEC member Libya’s oil output is at around 1.05 million barrels per day despite a continuing outage since February at its 70,000 bpd El Feel oilfield, a Libyan oil source told Reuters on Friday. U.S. drillers added 11 oil rigs in the week to April 6, bringing the total count up to 808, the highest level since March 2015, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. The Permian basin in Texas is leading the way as U.S. oil production has reached an all-time high, but the prolific output is causing bottlenecks as pipelines transporting the crude have filled up more quickly than expected, depressing prices in the region. Some market participants are still optimistic on the oil sector.  “We’re cautiously bullish here,” said Dan Hussey, a market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago. “It’s the fundamentals.” U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly fell last week, data showed on Wednesday.  Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said that an arrangement under which Moscow cooperates with the OPEC oil group could become indefinite once a current deal to curb oil production expires at the end of the year. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other large oil producers led by Russia have agreed to curtail their combined output by around 1.8 million barrels per day until the end of 2018 to smooth out bloated oil inventories. OPEC and its allies should keep the cuts to ensure healthy price levels as a way to boost investment in the industry and avoid a supply and price shock in the long run, Qatar’s energy minister said. Asian oil traders are stumped by how Saudi Arabia derived its official selling prices (OSP) for May after the world’s top oil exporter unexpectedly raised the price for its flagship Arab Light crude sold to Asian refiners.

2018-04-06,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude oil and global equity markets tumbled on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump upped the ante in a trade dispute with China, reviving investor jitters about the impact a tariff war could have on the world economy. MSCI’s gauge of worldwide equity markets fell more than 1 percent and stocks on Wall Street skidded more than 2 percent after Trump threatened late on Thursday to add another $100 billion of tariffs on Chinese goods. China warned it was fully prepared to respond with a “fierce counter strike” of fresh trade measures if the United States follows through on Trump’s latest threat. The U.S. equity rout picked up during a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in Chicago on the U.S. economy. Powell said it was too early to tell if the threatened tariffs would materialise or the effect they might have. “What Powell is signalling to market participants is that the Fed is not swayed or rattled by equity market volatility at this point. That’s the reason for the additional selling pressure,” said Chad Morganlander, a portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors in Florham Park, New Jersey. “The Fed has the intestinal fortitude to wait until it creeps into credit conditions and causes financial stress,” he said. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, which closed before Powell’s speech, fell 0.4 percent but ended the week 1.15 percent higher.  The STOXX Europe index of companies in 17 European countries fell 0.35 percent, with the trade-exposed auto sector the leading sectoral loser, down 1.7 percent. Earlier in Asia, Japan’s Nikkei nudged down slightly  to regain a measure of calm after an initial knee-jerk reaction to Trump’s latest tariff proposal. Defensive stocks such as utilities or telecoms were among a handful of European sectors to end the day in higher. MSCI’s all-country index of stock performance in 47 countries fell 1.2 percent, led lower by Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com and JPMorgan - the same as on the benchmark S&P 500 index. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 572.46 points, or 2.34 percent, to 23,932.76. The S&P 500 lost 58.37 points, or 2.19 percent, to 2,604.47 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 161.44 points, or 2.28 percent, to 6,915.11. The market’s decline is due more to its current vulnerable state than the prospect of a trade war, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. “It’s got higher values; financial liquidity is contracting. You came into the year with a little too much optimism. You got rising rates going on, you got rising inflation fears,” he said. Powell said the U.S. central bank will likely need to keep raising interest rates to keep inflation under control. A weak U.S. unemployment report, which nonetheless highlighted underlying labour market strength, helped push U.S. Treasury prices higher as the economy created the fewest jobs in six months in March. Oil prices tumbled, with U.S. crude falling more than 2 percent.  Brent crude futures fell $1.22 to settle at $67.11 a  barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled down $1.48 at $62.06. U.S. Treasury and euro zone government bond yields dipped as   the trade spat raised the prospect of a full-blown trade war between the world’s two largest economies. The yield on 10-year German government debt, the euro zone benchmark, dipped 2.7 basis points in late trading to 0.494 percent, erasing much of Thursday’s rise.  Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 15/32 in price to push yields down to 2.7753 percent. Mike Terwilliger, portfolio manager of Resource Liquid Alternatives for the Resource Credit Income Fund, said nearly every news event seems to register on the market’s Richter scale, though investors have been dealing with some relatively weighty challenges this year.  “The recent decline in Treasuries is largely ‘Tweet related’ versus some fundamental shift in the view of inflation or economic growth,” he said. The dollar index fell 0.37 percent, with the euro up 0.36 percent to $1.2282. The Japanese yen firmed 0.45 percent at 106.90 per dollar. U.S. gold futures for June delivery settled up 0.6 percent at $1,336.10 an ounce.

2018-04-06,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will review a list of potential changes to the nation’s renewable fuel laws at a meeting with members of his cabinet on Monday, two sources said, as biofuels groups warned against any action that would weaken ethanol demand. Trump in recent months has waded deep into the controversial issue of reforming the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, a 2005 law requiring refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels into their fuel pool each year, or buy credits from those who do. Merchant refiners like Valero and PBF Energy pulled Trump into the debate, arguing that complying with the regulation has grown too costly and will kill off the types of blue-collar jobs Trump had promised to defend.  But Trump’s efforts to reform the law have been met by fierce opposition from corn farmers and ethanol producers who are quick to remind the president that he also vowed to preserve the RFS during corn-belt campaign stops. Monday’s meeting will include Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt and Agricultural Secretary Sonny Perdue. Pruitt heads into the meeting under pressure from lawmakers to resign over allegations he broke ethics rules by renting a room in a Washington condo owned by the wife of an energy industry lobbyist. Pruitt and Perdue have spent the last several weeks compiling a list of options for Trump to consider on the RFS, ranging from more aggressive tactics like capping the prices of blending credits, called RINs, to lifting seasonal restrictions on high-ethanol gasoline sales. “A waiver or cap on RIN prices would fundamentally undermine the Renewable Fuel Standard and deal a massive blow to rural America,” Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said in a statement on Friday.  In recent weeks, advisers have urged Trump to let lawmakers tackle the issue, and only use the threat of executive action to coerce them to make it a priority.  Iowa farmers and biofuel groups sent a letter to Grassley and fellow Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst on Friday, urging them to reach out to Trump to express their anger. “Any Administration action to waive or cap RINs will be viewed as nothing less than a declaration of war on rural America and a complete abdication of his repeated promises to protect the RFS,” said the letter, orchestrated by the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association. Biofuel groups are also frustrated with the administration over reports that the EPA was exempting small refineries from the program, including three owned by one of the nation’s largest refining companies, Andeavor.

2018-04-06,"(Adds data on some of Gazprom’s partners globally) MOSCOW, April 6 (Reuters) - The United States imposed sanctions on Friday against Russian businessmen, companies and government officials. Below are the names of the most prominent businessmen targeted along with their main assets/connections and extracts from the U.S. Treasury statement. OLEG DERIPASKA, main owner of En+, co-owner of Rusal and Norilsk Nickel Deripaska is ranked by Forbes magazine as Russia’s 19th richest businessman with a net worth of $6.7 billion. Deripaska holds regular meetings with Putin, invested heavily in Russia’s 2014 Sochi winter Olympics, and has said his own interests are indivisible from the state’s. En+ has a 48 percent stake in Rusal, one of the world’s largest aluminium producers. Rusal is listed in Hong Kong and counts Glencore among its shareholders. Rusal has assets in Italy, Ireland, Sweden, as well as Nigeria, Guyana, Guinea, and a stake in Australian QAL, the world’s top alumina refinery. Over 10 percent of Rusal’s total sales go to the United States. “Oleg Deripaska is being designated ... for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, a senior official of the Government of the Russian Federation, as well as ... for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy.” VIKTOR VEKSELBERG, key owner of Renova holding group Forbes magazine ranks Vekselberg as Russia’s ninth richest businessman with a net worth of $14.4 billion. He is famous for bringing back a collection of Faberge eggs to Russia. Apart from Russia, Renova has assets in the United States and Europe, of which the most notable are stakes in the Swiss companies Sulzer, Schmolz+Bickenbach and Oerlikon. They are not under sanctions. Vekselberg and his partners also have a stake in Rusal , which supplies aluminium to the United States and other countries. “Viktor Vekselberg is being designated for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Vekselberg is the founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Renova Group.” KIRILL SHAMALOV, minority shareholder with petrochemical company Sibur Shamalov married Putin’s youngest daughter Katerina in February 2013, multiple sources who were at the wedding told Reuters. After the marriage, he swiftly grew his wealth through investments in Russia’s biggest petrochemical company Sibur. Unconfirmed media reports say Shamalov and Putin’s daughter have since split. Forbes magazine says Shamalov is Russia’s 72nd richest businessman with a net worth of $1.4 billion. Shamalov now owns 3.9 pct in Sibur. Gennady Timchenko, a close associate of President Vladimir Putin, holds a stake in the company as well. Sibur is not under sanctions. “Kirill Shamalov is being designated for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Shamalov married Putin’s daughter Katerina Tikhonova in February 2013 and his fortunes drastically improved following the marriage.” ANDREI SKOCH, a deputy in the Russian State Duma, the lower house of parliament Forbes magazine says Skoch is Russia’s 23rd wealthiest businessman with a net worth of $4.9 billion. Skoch’s father, Vladimir, owns a stake in USM holding. Businessman Alisher Usmanov is a key shareholder in USM. Neither Usmanov nor USM are under sanctions. Via USM, Skoch’s father co-owns Metalloinvest, Russia’s largest and the world’s second-largest mining company by the size of iron ore reserves, with units in Ireland, Switzerland and Guinea. USM also has stakes in Megafon, Russia’s second largest mobile operator, in MAIL.RU Group, one of Russia’s largest internet companies, and in Russian social networks VKontakte and Odnoklassniki.

Skoch is a deputy of the Russian Federation’s State Duma.” SULEIMAN KERIMOV, member of the Russian upper house of parliament Kerimov is ranked by Forbes magazine as Russia’s 20th wealthiest businessman, with a net worth of $6.4 billion. Embroiled in a tax fraud investigation in France, the Kremlin has said it will do all it can to help him. Polyus, Russia’s largest gold producer, is controlled by Kerimov’s family.  Polyus is not under sanctions. “Suleiman Kerimov is being designated for being an official of the Government of the Russian Federation. Kerimov is a member of the Russian Federation Council.” VLADIMIR BOGDANOV, chief executive of oil company Surgutneftegaz Forbes magazine puts Bogdanov’s net worth at $1.8 billion, making him Russia’s 53rd wealthiest businessman.

2018-04-06,"April 6 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies added oil rigs for the third time in four weeks as crude prices drifted from a three-year high hit earlier this year amid concerns of a trade war between U.S. and China. Drillers added 11 oil rigs in the week to April 6, bringing the total count up to 808, the highest level since March 2015, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI This was the biggest weekly addition in about two months. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is much higher than a year ago when 672 rigs were active. Energy companies have been steadily increasing spending since mid-2016 when crude prices began recovering from a two-year crash. U.S. crude futures traded around $62.30 a barrel this week, moving away from the three-year high of $66.66 hit in late January, but up from the $50.85 average hit in 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Looking ahead, futures were trading around $61.60 for the balance of 2018 and $58 for calendar 2019. In anticipation of higher prices, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said 58 of the roughly 65 exploration and production (E&P) companies they track have already provided guidance indicating an 11 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said those E&Ps that have reported capital plans for 2018 expected to spend a total of $80.5 billion in 2018, up from an estimated $72.4 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the total oil and natural gas rig count would average 1,013 in 2018 and 1,129 in 2019, against an outlook of 1,015 in 2018 and 1,128 in 2019 last week. So far this year, the total number of oil and natural gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 969, up sharply from an average of 876 rigs in 2017 and 509 in 2016, and not far from the total of 978 in 2015. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. The EIA projected last month that average annual U.S. production will rise to a record high 10.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 and 11.3 million bpd in 2019, up from 9.3 million bpd in 2017. The current all-time U.S. annual output peak was in 1970 at 9.6 million bpd, according to federal energy data.

2018-04-06,"LONDON (Reuters) - Gasoline stored in ships off Europe’s coast has ballooned to more than 400,000 tonnes, putting pressure on the continent’s traders to compete for buyers once summer demand starts. Several vessels have joined the three initially booked to store fuel off Europe’s ports in mid-March, and brokers said even barges have held cargoes of gasoline for three to four weeks as the volumes traded in Europe hit record levels last month.  The tankers Torm Tevere, Ridgebury John B and STI Clapham are now parked off Europe’s Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp hub, where on-land stocks hit a record 1.387 million tonnes last week, according to figures from PJK International.  Fuel in vessels, rather than in tanks on land, is typically the most expensive way to store fuel, so notable volumes of floating storage only build when the market is oversupplied. Volumes off the coast of Europe have risen from just over 250,000 tonnes in mid-March.  For a graphic on ARA Gasoline Stocks, click reut.rs/2GDMosy For a graphic on European Gasoline Margins, click reut.rs/2GCBJ13 Traders said the atypical floating fuel stores will target hungry buyers in the United States and the Middle East as the former restock following maintenance and the latter stock up before Ramadan. Already, some cargoes that had been parked off Europe’s coast, such as the Nan Lin Wan, are sailing for buyers in New York Harbor.  Expectations that prices in the coming months will rise above the current levels also created the market condition, known as contango, that allowed traders to make money storing the fuel in these tankers.  Profits for gasoline have also risen significantly since late last month as the market shifted to summer-quality fuel — and sellers cleared their backlog of winter grades.  Industry monitor Genscape showed a spike in the amount of gasoline booked to sail from Europe to West Africa and the Americas in the week to March 30, rising to more than 700,000 tonnes for the former and more than 400,000 tonnes for the latter.      But analysts said the owners of the fuel - and refineries in Europe - could run into trouble if demand does not come in particularly strong over the summer.  “We’re just dealing with the fact that there is a fair amount (of fuel) out there,” said Robert Campbell, head of oil products research with consultancy Energy Aspects. “ARA stocks are full. There’s not the same sort of pull from the Middle East, and China is still exporting.” Chinese state energy giant CNPC said it had sold its first ever gasoline to the Americas, an indication of the ample supply in Asia that has also seen top trader Vitol store gasoline on tankers. Cargo tracking firm Kpler said that there is Korean gasoline on the Marlin Ammolite heading for Ecuador, and Chinese gasoline aboard the BW Wren en route to Mexico, underscoring the coming fight for buyers.

2018-04-06,"(Adds U.S. market open, byline, dateline; previous LONDON) * Trump threat of more China tariffs hurts stocks * Equity markets in the red but weakness limited * Bond yields fall on weak US jobs report, trade spat By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - Crude prices and global equity markets fell on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump upped the ante in a trade dispute with China that added to investor jitters about the potential impact the heated rhetoric may have on the world economy. MSCI’s gauge of worldwide stock indexes fell 0.65 percent, and all three major U.S. stock indexes slid more than 1 percent, after Trump threatened late Thursday to slap tariffs on an additional $100 billion of Chinese goods. China warned it was fully prepared to respond with a “fierce counter strike” of fresh trade measures if the United States follows through on Trump’s latest threat. A weak U.S. jobs report helped push U.S. Treasury prices higher as the economy created the fewest jobs in six months in March, but the market’s main focus was on mounting U.S.-China tensions. “The jobs report is taking a back seat to the trade discussion and back and forth between the U.S. and China,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. “Think of it as a game of poker and (Trump’s) raising the stakes a little bit,” he said. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed down a preliminary 0.55 percent and MSCI’s gauge of emerging market stocks lost 0.40 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 345.64 points, or 1.41 percent, to 24,159.58. The S&P 500 lost 26.48 points, or 0.99 percent, to 2,636.36 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 60.21 points, or 0.85 percent, to 7,016.34. Oil prices tumbled, with U.S. crude falling about 2 percent. as China is a large importer of U.S. crude oil. “The heightened possibility of an outright tariff war is conjuring up images of slowed economic growth that could curtail the strong oil demand that has helped to revive a strong pricing environment during the past couple of months,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. Brent crude futures fell 98 cents to $67.35 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures slid $1.21 to $62.33 a barrel. U.S. Treasury and euro zone government bond yields dipped as the trade spat raised the prospect of a full-blown trade war between the world’s two largest economies. The yield on 10-year German government debt, the euro zone benchmark, dipped 2.7 basis points in late trading to 0.494 percent, erasing much of Thursday’s rise. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 12/32 in price to push yields down to 2.7881 percent. The dollar index, tracking the unit against other major currencies, fell 0.3 percent, with the euro up 0.25 percent to $1.2268. The Japanese yen firmed 0.32 percent versus the greenback at 107.07 per dollar.

2018-04-06,"WASHINGTON, April 6 (Reuters) - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt held 25-times more meetings with industry representatives than environmental advocates during his first seven months in office, according to a Reuters analysis of his schedule, reflecting the agency’s pro-business approach under his tenure. The newly released records, obtained by the Environmental Integrity Project watchdog group through a Freedom of Information Act request, come as the White House probes ethics allegations against Pruitt. These include his rental of a room in a Washington D.C. condo owned by the wife of an energy industry lobbyist. Pruitt, a vocal doubter of mainstream climate change science, has also faced criticism for frequent first-class air travel, spending on costly items in his office, including a $43,000 soundproof telephone booth, and for a trip to Morocco where he promoted U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas – something outside the remit of an environmental regulator. President Donald Trump has praised Pruitt’s work at the EPA for aggressively pursuing his agenda to roll back regulations he sees as unnecessary to pave the way for more oil, gas, and coal production and remove hurdles for a revival in domestic manufacturing. Trump on Thursday said Pruitt was doing a “fantastic job” and was well-loved in “coal and energy country.” According to the calendar, Pruitt met with representatives of the industries EPA regulates at least 105 times from Feb. 22 to Aug. 10, making up about 77 percent of his total meetings during that period. About half of those industry meetings were with representatives of the oil, gas, coal and mining industries – including executives from companies like oil major BP, refining giant Valero Energy Corp, coal producer Murray Energy, and miner BHP Billiton, according to the records. Most of the rest of the industry meetings were with representatives of agriculture, including farm groups like the National Cattlemen’s Association, and biofuels producers like Growth Energy and POET, according to the records. By contrast, Pruitt met only four times with environmental groups eager to see the EPA limit pollution from those industries - Trout Unlimited, the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a nonprofit association of state environmental agency leaders called ECOS, and the Alliance to Restore Our Waterways – according to the records. Past EPA administrators have been criticized for spending too much time with environmental lobby groups, and too little with industry. An EPA spokesman, Jahan Wilcox, did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the balance of Pruitt’s meetings. Liz Purchia Gannon, a spokeswoman for former EPA administrator Gina McCarthy, who served under President Barack Obama, said the ratio of Pruitt’s industry to environmental group meetings was a contrast to the ratio of meetings McCarthy held. McCarthy met frequently with utility groups while the agency worked to form the Clean Power Plan, Obama’s top proposal to curb greenhouse gas emissions, Gannon said. “As head of EPA she always met with environmental and public health groups and industry and business leaders. She believed strongly in meeting regularly with all sides,” said Gannon, who did not provide data on the meetings. Pruitt also held a number of meetings with conservative policy think-tanks like the Heritage Foundation, and the Family Research Council, a religious group that argues that homosexual conduct is harmful to society, according to the records. A portion of Pruitt’s schedule covering his first few months in office had already been released by the EPA, but the latest batch covers the broadest period so far.

2018-04-06,"LONDON (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase has acknowledged it knew a former Nigerian oil minister convicted of money laundering would benefit when it transferred over $800 million of government funds to a company he controlled, according to a court document seen by Reuters. JP Morgan made the acknowledgement in its legal response to a lawsuit filed by Nigeria over transactions made by the U.S. bank when Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Eni (ENI.MI) bought offshore oilfield OPL 245 from Malabu Oil and Gas in 2011. The $1.3 billion deal has spawned legal cases spanning several countries and involving Nigerian government officials and senior ENI and Shell executives, a number of whom face trial in Italy on corruption charges next month. Malabu is controlled by Dan Etete, who was Nigeria’s oil minister at the time of the deal and was convicted of money laundering in France in 2007. He could not be reached for comment. The lawsuit against JP Morgan accuses the bank of negligence over the transfer of funds from a Nigerian government escrow account into which Shell and Eni had deposited money to secure OPL 245. It claims $875 million from the bank.  In its written defence, filed in a British court last week,   JP Morgan said Britain’s Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), now renamed the National Crime Agency, had approved the transfers to Malabu. It denied negligence. The bank had previously said only that it “considers the allegations made in the claim to be unsubstantiated and without merit”.  JP Morgan did not provide a comment on the filing. Lawyers representing Nigeria did not respond to requests for comment.  It was not immediately clear whether JP Morgan’s acknowledgement that it knew of Etete’s links with Malabu will have any impact on the trial starting in Milan in May. Italian prosecutors were not immediately available for comment.  Eni’s chief executive is among those going on trial in Milan on charges of paying bribes to Etete and others, including sums that went to Malabu. Shell and Eni deny wrongdoing in relation to OPL 245.  Shell said in April last year that it “always knew” the Nigerian government would compensate Malabu and that Etete was involved. It had previously told Reuters only that payments went to the Nigerian government.  The lawsuit against JP Morgan said that although it received a request from Nigeria’s finance ministry to transfer funds to accounts controlled by Malabu, the bank showed gross negligence by not making further checks before allowing the transaction. Denying negligence, JP Morgan said in its response that the transfers were authorised by designated government signatories for the Depository Account — the then finance minister and the African country’s accountant general.  The bank also said it knew Etete was the beneficiary of Malabu by July 2011, one month before it made the transfers, and that by July 14, 2011, it “was aware of Etete’s conviction”. “It is admitted that the order referred to Etete as Malabu’s principal. [...] It is admitted that by 15 July 2011 JPMC (JP Morgan Chase) was aware of Etete and of his association with Malabu,” it said in the court filing. JP Morgan also denied that it had acted in breach of  Nigeria’s constitution or owed the government or state any further due diligence.  “It is denied that ‘the utilisation of the Depository Account’ was contrary to the constitution... It is denied that JPMC ‘should have been aware’ that this was (allegedly) the case,” the filing said.

Ramaphosa, who replaced former president Jacob Zuma in February, has made the fight against corruption a key plank of his administration as he seeks to restore investor confidence after the scandal-plagued Zuma era. The announcement of the probe was published in the government gazette. The SIU, which investigates malpractice in state institutions, state assets and public money, will investigate among other things, “unauthorised, irregular or fruitless and wasteful expenditure” incurred by Eskom and Transnet. Eskom has been embroiled in allegations of corruption relating to a 1.6 billion rand ($130 million) contract that global consultancy McKinsey worked on with Trillian, a local company that was then controlled by Gupta family who are accused of using their access to Zuma to win state contracts. Zuma and the Guptas have denied any wrongdoing Transnet, which is also state-owned, has been investigating irregularities in the awarding of a 54 billion rand ($5 billion) contract to acquire locomotives in 2014.

2018-04-06,"BOGOTA, April 6 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Colombia’s highest court has told the government it must take urgent action to protect its Amazon rainforest and stem rising deforestation, in what campaigners said was an historic moment that should help conserve forests and counter climate change. In their ruling on Thursday, the judges said that Colombia - which is home to a swathe of rainforest roughly the size of Germany and England combined - saw deforestation rates in its Amazon region increase by 44 percent from 2015 to 2016. “It is clear, despite numerous international commitments, regulations ... that the Colombian state has not efficiently addressed the problem of deforestation in the Amazon,” the supreme court said. The ruling comes after a group of 25 young plaintiffs, ranging in age from seven to 26, filed a lawsuit against the government in January demanding it protect their right to a healthy environment. The plaintiffs had said the government’s failure to stop the destruction of the Amazon jeopardised their futures and violated their constitutional rights to a healthy environment, life, food and water. Bogota-based rights group Dejusticia, which supported the plaintiffs’ case, said the verdict meant it was the first time a lawsuit of this kind had been ruled upon favourably in Latin America. “The Supreme Court’s decision marks an historical precedent in terms of climate change litigation,” said Camila Bustos, one of the plaintiffs and a researcher at Dejusticia. In its ruling, the court recognised Colombia’s Amazon as an “entity subject of rights”, which means that the rainforest has been granted the same legal rights as a human being. “The ruling states the importance of protecting the rights of future generations, and even declares the Amazon a subject of rights,” Bustos told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The court ordered the government - both at the local and national level - along with the environment and agriculture ministries and environmental authorities to come up with action plans within four months to combat deforestation in the Amazon. The Amazon’s destruction leads to “imminent and serious” damage to children and adults for both present and future generations, the judges said. The ruling stated that forests were being felled to make way for more grazing and agricultural land, as well as coca crops - the raw ingredient for cocaine - illegal mining and logging. Deforestation is a key source of greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change, which damages ecosystems and water sources and leads to land degradation, the court said. “Without a healthy environment, subjects of law and living beings in general will not be able to survive, let alone safeguard those rights for our children or for future generations,” the ruling said. The lawsuit follows a surge in litigation around the world demanding action or claiming damages over the impact of climate change - from rising sea levels to pollution.

2018-04-06,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) said on Friday it opposes any repeal by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency of the Clean Power Plan, which is a priority of the agency’s Administrator Scott Pruitt and would reverse an Obama-era program to curb greenhouse gases.   Repealing the plan would jeopardize the country’s position in the race for investments in clean energy, particularly its competition with China, Apple said. It was the first public comment by a company on the proposed repeal of the plan, which has never been implemented because of legal challenges. “Repealing the Clean Power Plan will subject consumers like Apple and our large manufacturing partners to increased investment uncertainty,” the California-based company said in a filing to the agency. Apple, which says it runs its U.S. operations fully on renewable energy such as wind and solar power, added that repeal of the plan would also threaten development and investments that have already been made in renewable power. Lisa Jackson, who was the EPA’s chief from 2009 to 2013 under former President Barack Obama, runs Apple’s program to address climate change through renewable energy and energy efficiency. The opposition from one of America’s biggest and best known companies to Pruitt’s planned repeal comes as the EPA head is battling allegations about his ethics, including that he leased a room in a Washington townhouse co-owned by the wife of energy industry lobbyist. Pruitt proposed last October to repeal the Clean Power Plan, a set of standards for U.S. states intended to cut pollution from power plants, the largest emitters of greenhouse gases, by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. In December, the EPA launched a comment period for a possible replacement of the plan. Under Pruitt, the EPA has said the Clean Power Plan was illegal and exceeded the agency’s statutory authority. The plan never went into effect after it was suspended by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. The EPA has not indicated whether or when it would propose a new rule to regulate the emissions.  The proposed repeal is part of Trump’s broader effort to support the coal, oil and natural gas industries and to boost exports of the resources to cut trade deficits.   EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox said in a response to Apple’s filing that the agency appreciates all public feedback and will be considering the comments as part of the rulemaking process.

2018-04-06,"* Algeria plans to reduce energy spending * Govt wants to convert cars to natural gas, boost renewables * OPEC producer suffers from halving of energy revenues since 2014 By Hamid Ould Ahmed ALGIERS, April 6 (Reuters) - Algeria is offering motorists incentives to more than double the number of cars running on natural gas by 2021 in an effort to reduce consumption of costly imported fuel amid strained public finances, officials said. The North African country has been struggling with a halving since 2014 of vital oil and gas revenues, which make up 60 percent of the budget and 95 percent of exports. It has banned imports of 900 items, frozen public hiring and development projects, but now wants to tackle energy spending as the country - a member of the oil producer group OPEC - needs to save more. Officials hope that making the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) more attractive will reduce gasoline and diesel consumption, 2.9 million tonnes of which Algeria needs to import annually. The government is offering to cover partially the cost of car conversions for drivers, tax exemptions and a stable retail price for LPG, of which domestic output is sufficient. In contrast, the pump price of subsidised gasoline and diesel has risen about 50 percent since 2016. Algeria plans to convert 500,000 vehicles by 2021 and 1.1 million by 2030, said Mohamed Bouzeriba, head of the National Agency for the Promotion and Rationalisation of the Use of Energy. So far, only 200,000 cars run on gas out of a total 6 million. Making the switch is appealing for some Algerians who complain about imported food inflation. “As a taxi driver, only LPG can help me rebalance my budget,” Mohamed Tami said as he refilled his car. Algeria, which has spent billions of dollars to provide cheap apartments and other benefits as a means of avoiding protests, is keen to tackle energy spending to maintain social order. Authorities also want to cut electricity consumption. State utility Sonelgaz still needs aid despite a 20 percent power price increase two years ago, the first in more than a decade. Demand for electricity has risen significantly in recent years due to infrastructure projects aimed at diversifying the economy away from oil and gas. Algeria has also been building thousands of subsidised housing units and connecting them to the power grid. To boost power output, the government plans to invite bids for the construction of three photovoltaic solar plants with a capacity of 4,000 megawatts, officials said. In an effort to save power, the state electricity company has started to replace public lighting in some towns and roads under an energy-efficiency programme. Officials say measures may also include higher electricity prices for firms in the next few years. “Everyone must comply with rationalisation, especially in administrative and public buildings, social housing, schools and mosques as well as with public lighting,” Energy Minister Mustapha Guitouni said at a conference. To hammer home the message, state television has launched campaigns urging people to reduce consumption. It is also promoting solar water heaters, energy-saving lamps and thermal insulation in the housing sector. But analysts say making some appliances available may need additional spending as Algeria imports most of its needs.

2018-04-06," (This April 5 story corrects paragraph 18 to show the expansion will add 200,000 barrels of daily capacity, not 200 million barrels.) By Devika  Krishna Kumar NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Permian basin in Texas is leading the way as U.S. oil production has reached an all-time high, but the prolific output is causing bottlenecks as pipelines transporting the crude have filled up more quickly than expected.  That has depressed prices there, posing a threat to future production, while providing a boost to pipeline companies as the lines have filled to near-capacity. With few new pipeline projects scheduled for this year, producers may be forced to slow drilling, or even shut in active production.  The problem illustrates the snags that can arise in transporting crude to the U.S. Gulf Coast as oil prices have rebounded to more than $60 a barrel and companies have reduced costs to make drilling more profitable in the Permian.  Production there is estimated to have hit a record 3.08 million bpd in March, nearly a third of overall U.S. production of 10.4 million bpd, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Permian drillers are branching out into relatively less-profitable areas of the region, said John Zanner, energy analyst for RBN Energy. “As these fringe areas begin to get exploited, we are seeing more and more crude that needs to find a pipeline to Cushing or the Gulf Coast,” he said. Most analysts estimated pipelines out of the Permian would fill completely by mid-2018, but this may already be happening. According to market intelligence firm Genscape, pipeline utilization from the Permian to the Gulf Coast averaged about 89 percent this year and 96 percent in the last four weeks. U.S. crude for delivery in Midland, Texas WTC-WTM traded at $5.50/barrel under the price of benchmark futures on Wednesday, weakest since October 2014. West Texas Sour WTC-WTS, the sour grade delivered into Midland, traded as much as $6.25 a barrel below futures.  Midland light sweet crude currently trades at more than $8 a barrel below West Texas Intermediate at East Houston, a key delivery spot for export markets - the biggest discount on record. (GRAPHIC: Prices of U.S. crude in Permian, Texas, plunge as pipelines fill tmsnrt.rs/2GVmwYj) (GRAPHIC: Texas oil output surge reut.rs/2EmL4nN) “What the spreads are telling you is that these pipelines are full going to the Gulf Coast,” said Kendrick Rhea at energy consultancy East Daley Capital. The wide spreads mean pipeline operators are now seeing a surge in demand and throughput, traders and analysts said. Spreads have even widened enough to cover spot shipping rates, which are typically higher than long-term committed rates offered by pipeline companies.  For midstream companies, this could show up in earnings reports for several quarters. Analysts’ revenue projections for Permian pipeline companies Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD.N), Energy Transfer Partners LP ETP.N and Plains All American Pipeline LP (PAA.N) have been revised higher over the last 90 days, according to Thomson Reuters data.  All three rank in the top 10 percent in terms of upward revisions for North American companies in the Thomson Reuters universe, and the same model projects all three will exceed revenue projections in the first quarter. “They’re going to see record flows coming out, they’re going to see record margins on marketing and on walk-up tariffs for the rest of the year,” Rhea said. As of March 2018, the Permian had a total of 3.175 million bpd of outgoing pipeline, rail and local refining capacity, according to Genscape, of which outgoing pipeline capacity accounts for 2.725 million bpd.   The next boost will be the expansion of Permian Express 3, which will add 200,000 barrels of daily capacity in late 2018. The Enterprise Midland-to-Sealy line could also expand capacity to bring it to 450,000 bpd from 330,000 bpd late last year. By mid-to-late 2019, projects including the Cactus Pipeline 2 and EPIC lines will add more than 1.5 million bpd of additional capacity.

2018-04-06,"STORD, Norway (Reuters) - Rising more than 20 metres above the sea, Statoil’s STL.OL Aasta Hansteen platform towers over the Stord shipyard in western Norway, representing the height of engineering in the offshore oil sector. It will probably be the last platform of its kind to leave here.  Nearby is what the future is more likely to hold for yard owner Kvaerner (KVAER.OL): the rusty Njord A platform, which it built two decades ago, is back for a refit so it can continue production in the North Sea for another 20 years.     Oil companies posted bumper profits in the fourth quarter, benefiting from rising crude prices and cost cuts made during the slump years between 2014 and 2017, but they have made it clear in recent months that they will not let costs rise again.  For Statoil, this has meant calling time on giant oil platforms and instead looking to build more modest installations and, where possible, revamp existing infrastructure.  For hundreds of suppliers, from oil services firms to rig owners or engineering companies, this means coming to terms with the fact that industry spending may not rebound as it has after previous downturns.  As well as cutting their own costs further, they must adapt by finding alternative sources of revenue in the Norwegian sector, one of the world biggest offshore markets and viewed as a global bellwether. For Kvaerner, which like many peers relies on Statoil for much of its revenue, the focus is to expand business areas that are currently small but which it expects to offer the best paths to growth in the new industry reality. These activities include decommissioning and recycling platforms, refitting existing ones and building smaller, unmanned platforms, the company said in its fourth-quarter report last month. “In the traditional oil platform market, we expect that it will level out in the short term, but decline over the longer term,” Kvaerner CFO Idar Eikrem told Reuters. At the Stord yard, set in a fjord surrounded by snow-capped mountains, Kvaerner cut its cost base by 20-25 percent during the oil market slump, but that might not be enough.  “We still need to chase cost cuts, even now. We are competitive now, but we will not be tomorrow if we keep on ‘charging’, as we used to say,” Steinar Roegenes, the yard’s managing director, told Reuters.  For a graphic on Oil services index vs. crude, click reut.rs/2GwIphf The writing is on the wall globally. Last year, 16 out of 24 offshore projects sanctioned by oil companies worldwide were expansions of “brownfield” sites that have already been developed rather than new projects, according to a report published on Thursday by energy consultancy WoodMackenzie. The consultancy did not provide comparative figure for previous years, but said it was seeing “significantly smaller projects, alongside a greater appetite for brownfield and expansion projects”. “Not only are these projects less risky than greenfield developments, they also tend to be less capital-intensive and are quicker to bring onstream, offering a quicker payback and better returns on development dollars,” the consultancy said.  “We should continue to see operators favouring a ‘leaner and meaner’ path in 2018.” Like Kvaerner, other offshore suppliers are also diversifying in Norway.  Oil services firm Aker Solutions (AKSOL.OL) bought a 5 percent stake in California-based Principle Power, which builds foundations for floating offshore windmills, for an undisclosed sum in February, with a view to increase it to 10 percent at the end of the year.  “We see a major opportunity in offshore floating wind where demand is growing in the transition to a low-carbon future,” Aker Solutions CEO Luis Araujo said. Subsea 7 (SUBC.OL), which specialises in building and laying oil and gas installations on the seabed, is expanding into renewables, by installing offshore wind farms.   It is bidding for tenders installing offshore wind mills in Britain, Germany, France, among others, following its work installing the turbines of the Beatrice wind farm, Scotland’s largest offshore wind park. “In the ... medium to long term the renewable business is, without any doubt, a growing business,” Subsea 7 CEO Jean Cahuzac said on a call with analysts on March 1.  Any shifts by Statoil have huge repercussions in Norway, where it dominates an offshore oil sector, which accounts for more than 100,000 jobs and has an annual turnover in the region of $50 billion.  Kvaerner, for example, relied on the oil major for about 60 percent of its 6.5 billion Norwegian crowns ($831 million) revenue last year. Aker Solutions, which drew more than half of its 22.5 billion crowns revenue from Norway, said Statoil was one of its top clients. Statoil said in February said new types of offshore installations could reduce capital spending by 30 percent and operating costs by 50 percent compared to conventional oil platforms - meaning less money for suppliers.  That spells an end to behemoths like Aasta Hansteen, which is the world’s largest spar-type platform and has a 200 metre-long cylindrical hull, most of which is submerged. “The Aasta Hansteen platform was decided in 2012,” Margareth Oevrum, Statoil’s head of technology, projects and drilling, told Reuters during a visit to the platform. “Had we decided it today, we would have built it smaller.” ($1 = 7.8503 Norwegian crowns)    Additional reporting by Liz Hampton in Houston; Editing by Gwladys Fouche and Pravin Char",https://uk.reuters.com/article/norway-oil/analysis-offshore-oil-industry-suppliers-fight-to-be-fit-for-frugal-future-idUKL5N1RG1LX,06 Apr 2018,* Graphic-Oil services index vs crude: https://reut.rs/2GwIphf,ANALYSIS-Offshore oil industry suppliers fight to be fit for frugal future
2018-04-06,"* JP Morgan responds to lawsuit filed by Nigeria * Suit follows oilfield deal involving Shell and Eni * JP Morgan denies negligence over transfer of funds * Funds went to firm controlled by convicted ex-minister * JP Morgan says British agency approved transfer By Julia Payne and Libby George LONDON, April 6 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase has acknowledged it knew a former Nigerian oil minister convicted of money laundering would benefit when it transferred over $800 million of government funds to a company he controlled, according to a court document seen by Reuters. JP Morgan made the acknowledgement in its legal response to a lawsuit filed by Nigeria over transactions made by the U.S. bank when Royal Dutch Shell and Eni bought offshore oilfield OPL 245 from Malabu Oil and Gas in 2011. The $1.3 billion deal has spawned legal cases spanning several countries and involving Nigerian government officials and senior ENI and Shell executives, a number of whom face trial in Italy on corruption charges next month. Malabu is controlled by Dan Etete, who was Nigeria’s oil minister at the time of the deal and was convicted of money laundering in France in 2007. He could not be reached for comment. The lawsuit against JP Morgan accuses the bank of negligence over the transfer of funds from a Nigerian government escrow account into which Shell and Eni had deposited money to secure OPL 245. It claims $875 million from the bank. In its written defence, filed in a British court last week, JP Morgan said Britain’s Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), now renamed the National Crime Agency, had approved the transfers to Malabu. It denied negligence. The bank had previously said only that it “considers the allegations made in the claim to be unsubstantiated and without merit”. JP Morgan did not provide a comment on the filing. Lawyers representing Nigeria did not respond to requests for comment. It was not immediately clear whether JP Morgan’s acknowledgement that it knew of Etete’s links with Malabu will have any impact on the trial starting in Milan in May. Italian prosecutors were not immediately available for comment. Eni’s chief executive is among those going on trial in Milan on charges of paying bribes to Etete and others, including sums that went to Malabu. Shell and Eni deny wrongdoing in relation to OPL 245. Shell said in April last year that it “always knew” the Nigerian government would compensate Malabu and that Etete was involved. It had previously told Reuters only that payments went to the Nigerian government. The lawsuit against JP Morgan said that although it received a request from Nigeria’s finance ministry to transfer funds to accounts controlled by Malabu, the bank showed gross negligence by not making further checks before allowing the transaction. Denying negligence, JP Morgan said in its response that the transfers were authorised by designated government signatories for the Depository Account — the then finance minister and the African country’s accountant general. The bank also said it knew Etete was the beneficiary of Malabu by July 2011, one month before it made the transfers, and that by July 14, 2011, it “was aware of Etete’s conviction”. “It is admitted that the order referred to Etete as Malabu’s principal. It is admitted that by 15 July 2011 JPMC (JP Morgan Chase) was aware of Etete and of his association with Malabu,” it said in the court filing. JP Morgan also denied it should have been aware of Nigeria’s constitutional law or that it owed the government or state any further due diligence.

2018-04-06,"LONDON, April 6 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Amit Bouri is evangelical that members of his network, and many more like them, can right the wrongs of the world using the muscle of their money. And, he said, he knows what needs to change to make that happen: the way the world’s financial markets work. “The system right now is not sufficiently creating an environment where there is equality and sustainability,” he said by phone from New York. Bouri heads the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN), a non-profit he co-founded in 2009 that supports and encourages impact investing - investments that produce positive social and environmental change, as well as generate a profit. “We are positing a very aspirational vision where all investors take into account social and environmental impact, where this becomes part of the new normal of how people invest.” According to Oxfam, a charity, the majority of the world is missing out. Last year the poorest half of the global population saw no increase in their wealth, while 82 percent of the wealth that was generated went to the richest 1 percent. Bouri said impact investing goes beyond avoiding harmful investments like tobacco and weapons, and focuses on investing proactively to drive change. Examples include the $75 million fund that built 10,000 affordable homes for low-income families in rural Brazil, and clean energy systems for those with limited access to power, including schools and hospitals, that investors funded in India. The amount of money going into impact investing is rising by about 18 percent a year, said the GIIN, whose 2017 survey found the impact investing market was worth at least $114 billion. “It is possible to make a profit and do good for the world. That is what has captured the attention of so many people when it comes to impact investing,” Bouri told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. He expects impact investing will keep growing, not least because reports have found millennials are more interested in such issues than their parents’ generation - as are women investors - and will inherit wealth in years to come. “That wealth is now going to be controlled by people that care about sustainability and impact,” he said. Bouri said the GIIN has also fielded more enquiries from institutional investors in the last 18 months - the pension funds and insurance companies that collectively manage trillions of dollars in assets. “These are firms that have fiduciary responsibilities they take very seriously: (an) obligation to pay back pensioners in 20 or 30 years from now,” he said. “The growing effects of inequality and climate change on market sustainability mean major fiduciaries are thinking about how they can incorporate impact into their investment strategy.” Aside from housing and clean energy, impact investing was also effective in areas such as conservation and access to clean water, said Bouri. Yet he feels its greatest contribution might lie in showing how finance can work in a different way. ""The GIIN absolutely believes that impact investing has a tremendous opportunity to grow - not just on its own, but in influencing how all investing is done. In doing so, we have the potential to set the world on a different trajectory,"" he said. (Reporting by Lee Mannion @leemannion, Editing by Robert Carmichael.

2018-04-06,"MADRID (Reuters) - Cox Energy has hired Deutsche Bank for a potential market listing in which the Spanish renewable energy firm aims for a valuation of 500 million euros ($612.2 million), sources familiar with the matter said. Madrid-based Cox, which was founded in 2014 to generate and sell electricity and gas in Europe and Latin America, now aims to raise funds to finance new projects through the potential listing, three sources said. Chairman Enrique Riquelme is seeking to strike a deal which would value the overall company at 500 million euros, one of the sources said. The decision to consider a stock market listing comes amid a revival of interest in green power in Spain after investors shunned the sector when the government cut subsidies in 2013 to balance a tariff deficit.  Across Europe, surging supplies of wind and solar power have forced down wholesale electricity prices prompting utility companies to shift toward renewables.  Cox has hired law firms Uria Menendez and Linklaters as advisers, the sources added. Spokespeople for Cox, Deutsche Bank, Uria Menendez and Linklaters declined to comment.  Cox owns solar plants in Spain and Portugal with potential capacity to supply 1,300 gigawatt hours per year. Last month, it signed a deal to supply fellow Spanish firm Audax Renovables with enough energy to power around 400,000 homes. It has projects with a potential capacity of 5,000 megawatts in the pipeline, according to its website. It aims to start supplying electricity from its solar plants - none of which are yet in operation - during the next two years.  “The group needs to fund its investments. It has a very ambitious pipeline but it still doesn’t generate enough income,” one of the sources said. Smaller renewable energy stocks were outperforming on Friday, while Madrid’s bourse fell slightly. Shares in Audax - which have surged 174 percent in the last month - gained 10 percent.

2018-04-06,"PARIS (Reuters) - When French President Emmanuel Macron flew into Riyadh for hastily arranged talks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in November it was all smiles in public, but in private a tough dialogue over Iran signalled a change between the allies. Whether that was a momentary tiff or a longer-lasting complication may become clear when Prince Mohammed arrives in Paris on Sunday for a two-day visit that will focus on the crises in Yemen, Syria and Qatar and the Iran nuclear deal. After trips to Britain and the United States with major contracts envisaged, the prince, or MBS as he is also known, will attend cultural events, political meetings and an economic forum. While a tourism project between the two countries will be announced, MBS is not expected to clinch any mega-deals. French officials dismiss any notion that the absence of huge contracts reflects any weakening in the relationship, saying they seek a new “method” of working with the world’s largest oil exporter that does not depend on eye-catching new business.   A warm relationship between Riyadh and Macron’s predecessor Francois Hollande did not result in the sharp expansion of business Paris had sought. “Competition is fierce so we had to rethink the models of relationships. Less talk about major contracts and more focus on sectors that are less spectacular such as health, education and tourism,” said a senior French diplomat.  But analysts note the 32-year-old Prince Mohammed has emphasised closer ties with U.S. President Donald Trump just at a time when Macron has in turn sought to improve relations with Iran and vowed to preserve the nuclear deal. Several Western and Arab diplomats describe the November exchange as tense. According to three officials, the meeting was dominated by Prince Mohammed threatening to curb relations with France if Macron did not alter his desire to dialogue with Iran, Riyadh’s regional rival, and push business interests there. Macron, the officials said, reminded Prince Mohammed of France’s position in the world as a nuclear power, permanent member of the Security Council member and that France was free to do what it wanted. In recent years, France had nurtured new links with the Sunni-ruled Gulf Arab states due to its tough stance on Iran in nuclear negotiations, and the broad similarity of their policies on conflicts across the Middle East. However, Prince Mohammed’s uncompromising efforts to counter Iran’s growing influence in the combustible Middle East are sometimes perceived as reckless in Paris. “The relationship could go either way, but it’s clear that Prince Mohammed feels more love from Trump than Macron,” said a second French diplomat. “While Macron recognises the reforming aspirations, he sees that MBS could be a real loose cannon and what he is doing in Yemen and Qatar and the talk on Iran has potential to add fuel to regional fire.” The visit comes amid growing pressure on Macron at home from lawmakers and rights groups over France’s weapons sales to the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. A private letter sent to Macron from 12 international non-governmental organisations urged him to pressure MBS to ease a blockade on Yemeni ports and suspend French arms sales.        “It is a bit of a new method of cooperation with Saudi Arabia that relies less on contracts, admittedly important but intermittent, and which will translate into a common vision. This is the general tone that will be given,” an official in the French presidency said.

2018-04-06,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s banking crisis and a weak economy could spell more trouble for its insurance sector, requiring further state support following the bailout of top insurer Rosgosstrakh last year, the head of the country’s main insurance lobby said. Russia’s financial industry has been hit hard by the fallout from Western sanctions over Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the economic impact of a sharp fall in oil prices. Three major private banks had to be rescued by the central bank last year, alongside Rosgosstrakh.  “The insurance sector is not immune to the diseases of the national economy,” Igor Yurgens, president of All-Russia Insurance Association, told Reuters in an interview. “There are big (insurance) firms highly dependent on the banking sector,” he said. Leading Russian banks such as Sberbank (SBER.MM), VTB (VTBR.MM), Alfabank and Uralsib own insurers, though none has shown any signs of trouble so far. A draft bill under discussion in parliament envisages the creation of a Fund for the Consolidation of the Insurance Sector, similar to the one that was set up for struggling banks.  The fund, to be run by the central bank, will pave the way for ailing insurers to be bailed out in case of an “unsustainable financial position that threatens insurants... other parties or the state, as well as the stability of financial markets,” according to the text of the draft bill.  The central bank can then sell on the insurer once its rescue has been completed, it said.  “The bailout scheme may increase confidence in the insurance market as it will boost the protection for its customers,” Yurgens said. The size of the planned insurance fund has not been disclosed, but central bank deputy head Vladimir Chistukhin indicated last year it would be smaller than its banking twin, which has so far pumped more than 2 trillion roubles ($35 billion) into troubled lenders. Insurance contracts in Russia totaled 1.28 trillion roubles in 2017, official data shows. The central bank has already spent 66 billion roubles to prop up Rosgosstrakh, which was part of the wider financial group that also owned the country’s biggest private bank Otkritie, rescued last year. Russia set up the Russian National Reinsurance Company (RNRC) last year to cater for firms that have been blacklisted by Western reinsurers because of the sanctions.  Yurgens said that Chinese reinsurers, including China Re, were also steering clear of Russian companies targeted by European and U.S. sanctions even though Beijing did not impose sanctions on Moscow and relations between the two countries were warming. “(Those businesses) are not being reinsured abroad, even by the Chinese. For that reason, the RNRC was established and it takes on 100 percent of the risk,” Yurgens said.   He said the central bank would keep printing money to fund the insurance and reinsurance sectors but warned this could end up triggering an inflationary spiral. “We will cover the things which are crucial for the country’s survival, as the Soviet Union did. But it will be expensive and done at the expense of the people.” Writing by Denis Pinchuk, editing by Katya Golubkova and Susan Fenton",https://uk.reuters.com/article/russia-banks-insurance/interview-russian-insurers-may-need-more-state-support-lobby-idUKL8N1RA38S,06 Apr 2018,"Russia's banking crisis and a

The draft bill, led by Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas, adds fuel to a fiery dispute between refiners and corn growers over the future of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) – a law that requires the refining sector to blend increasing amounts of biofuels such as corn-based ethanol into the nation’s fuel supply each year. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) already has the authority to exempt small refineries of under 75,000 barrels per day (bpd) on a case-by-case basis if they can prove “disproportionate economic hardship” from the costs of RFS compliance. Reuters reported this week that EPA had given Andeavor - one of the nation’s largest refining firms - the exemption for three of its refineries that fall under the 75,000-bpd standard. The decision could save the firm more than $50 million in regulatory costs. Andeavor reported $1.5 billion in profit last year. The report outraged representatives of the corn and biofuels industries, who argue giving the “small refiner” exemption to large, profitable companies is an abuse of the program that will undermine ethanol demand. The EPA also recently gave waivers from the RFS to more than two dozen refineries for 2017 - about triple the number granted in previous years. Such exemptions free refiners from the requirement to either blend biofuels into their refined products, or to buy EPA-awarded credits from refiners who do such blending. The cost of the credits can amount to tens of millions of dollars annually. Cornyn’s draft legislation would seek to reduce the burden of compliance to the 2005 law by providing a blanket exemption for all U.S. oil refineries classified as small, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  But it is not yet clear whether small refineries operated by publicly-traded giants such as Andeavor ANDV.N, Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), or Chevron (CVX.N), would be eligible for the blanket exemption, the sources said. Cornyn’s blanket exemption would mainly target small plants operated by private companies, they said.  After the Reuters report on the Andeavor exemption, a handful of biofuels groups called for a moratorium on new exemptions and greater transparency in the waiver program, which the EPA runs largely in secret to protect what it has deemed the companies’ private information. The Renewable Fuels Association filed a formal request with the EPA this week seeking details on who got the exemptions and why. Cornyn’s effort represents the oil industry’s best chance for biofuels reform after efforts by President Donald Trump to broker an executive or administrative-level fix ended in dispute. One of the sources on the draft bill said the blanket exemption was a “big priority” for the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, whose chairman, Wyoming Republican John Barrasso, is helping prepare the bill. Wyoming is home to several small refineries. Cornyn spokeswoman Ryann DuRant said the bill was “still being drafted based on stakeholder and legislative feedback.” She declined to comment directly on the waiver provision. Environmental and Public Works Committee spokesman Mike Danylak declined to speak about the draft legislation, but said: “Chairman Barrasso believes the Renewable Fuel Standard is broken and must be fixed.”  Cornyn’s draft would theoretically cut as much as 10 percent of America’s refining capacity out of the biofuels program - based on the combined production capacity of all U.S. refineries operating under 75,000 bpd. Biofuels advocates worry the provision would translate into a similar reduction in the volume of biofuels that the government requires under the RFS - currently over 19 billion gallons per year, mostly in ethanol. “We support narrow exemptions that allow some small refineries out of the program, but we vehemently oppose a blanket exemption,” said Michael McAdams, president of the Advanced Biofuels Council. Larger refining companies, meanwhile, fear the move would instead just shift a greater burden of the blending off of small players and onto them. The American Petroleum Institute, which represents companies operating the nation’s biggest refineries, said in a February letter to the EPA that U.S. biofuels policy must “maintain a level playing field in the marketplace, and must apply equally across the whole refining sector.” The sources did not say how Cornyn’s proposed blanket waiver would address the overall volumes mandates. The Cornyn draft bill also includes a slew of other measures, previously reported by Reuters, which are intended to help refiners while also helping maintain solid demand for ethanol. Among them is the addition of a new type of compliance credit that oil companies can use to meet their requirements under the RFS; the sunsetting of requirements to blend conventional renewable fuels like ethanol after 2022, combined with an extension for advanced fuels of about three years; and a waiver that would allow a higher ethanol fuel blend to be sold in summertime months.

2018-04-06,"MILAN (Reuters) - Offices of Italian oil major Eni (ENI.MI) were searched and documents seized in an investigation by Milan prosecutors into alleged corruption in Congo Republic, the company said on Friday, confirming what two sources had told Reuters. Prosecutors asked the company on Thursday to hand over documents relating to operations in Congo between 2009 and 2014, an Eni spokesman said by email, adding that Eni had met the request. The state-controlled major, under investigation in a separate case over alleged corruption in Nigeria, said the offices of two employees at the company had been raided, but gave no names. Eni said last year it was being investigated by Milan prosecutors for international corruption in the Congo Republic. The case revolves around agreements signed by Eni’s Congo subsidiary with the country’s Ministry of Hydrocarbons between 2013 and 2015 covering exploration and production permits and the choice of partners in the African country.  The sources said prosecutors were investigating whether certain contracts hid bribes to Congo public officials. “Eni has absolutely nothing to do with alleged wrongdoing regarding operations that are the object of investigation,” the Eni spokesman said. Eni, the biggest foreign oil and gas producer in Africa, has worked in the Congo Republic since 1968. In 2016 it produced 98,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the country.

2018-04-06,"MEXICO CITY, April 5 (Reuters) - Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the leftist leading the race to win Mexico’s presidency in July, will root out corruption at Pemex and also aims to slim down the state-owned oil and gas company, his pick for finance minister said on Thursday. In an interview with Reuters, Carlos Urzua, a respected economist trained at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said Lopez Obrador was not resolved to end oil and gas auctions started under the current government, but Urzua said major financial investors he had met with were worried about the energy reform. Urzua had harsh words for Pemex, saying it was neither competitive nor productive enough and adding that its trade union is “an icon of corruption.” “Pemex has to be cleaned up, because if not, we’re not going to have a top-flight company,” he said. In office, Urzua said Lopez Obrador’s government would aim to run a federal budget that was “more or less” in balance, once interest payments on debt were stripped out. To meet its other goals of upping investment and pensions, the government would seek to shake up wasteful social spending and curb excessive public sector salaries, he said. “We’re also going to slim down the structures of all the decentralized institutions, including Pemex,” he said. Lopez Obrador holds a double-digit lead in most opinion polls, and his criticism of the economic liberalization carried out under President Enrique Pena Nieto has caused concern among influential sections of the business community. The centerpiece of Pena Nieto’s agenda has been opening up oil and gas production and exploration to private firms. Lopez Obrador has strongly criticized the move, threatening to scrap the reform or at least review contracts awarded under it. Urzua sought to downplay fears that the energy overhaul, which was based on a change in the constitution, would be overturned. “The (auctions) wouldn’t necessarily be canceled, but they could be halted. Maybe there would be a slower pace,” he said. Urzua, who served as Mexico City’s finance minister for part of Lopez Obrador’s 2000-2005 mayoralty of the capital, added that he was “sure that the great majority of the contracts awarded” had not been tainted by corruption. Lopez Obrador has also rattled business leaders by threatening to scrap a $13 billion new airport for Mexico City, which the government says is already nearly one-third complete. Urzua said foreign investors were not very worried about the airport, noting that its major investors are Mexican. “But they are worried about the energy sector,” he said. Urzua said he has already held meetings with representatives from over 50 major investors in Mexico, including BlackRock, Pimco, Credit Suisse, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley. To eliminate public sector waste and corruption, Urzua said the Lopez Obrador administration would centralize all purchasing of goods and services in the federal government.

European shares followed their Asian counterparts into the red but the falls were limited, and the broader ups and downs for markets this week suggest investors are not yet convinced the row will escalate into a full-blown trade war that threatens global economic growth. The dollar, which has tended to fall as trade tensions rise, was largely flat on the day but is up half a percent this week, its second consecutive week of gains. European and U.S. government bond yields fell and prices rose as investors sought the safety of government debt, but the moves were moderate. In stock markets, Britain’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.22 percent while the German Dax was down 0.59 percent and France’s CAC 40 0.39 percent. The MSCI World Index slipped 0.1 percent while the S&P 500 E-mini futures shed 0.86 percent, pointing to a lower start for Wall Street when it opens. Trump said late on Thursday that he had instructed U.S. trade officials to consider $100 billion in additional tariffs on China. Beijing warned it would fight back “at any cost” with fresh measures to safeguard its interests. China’s commerce ministry called a media briefing on Friday night (1200 GMT), an unusual move on a public holiday. “Any escalation in the trade war rhetoric would be more negative for China than the U.S. given the former’s relative dependency on trade but, for now, the markets are focused on the payrolls data,” said Richard Falkenhall, a senior currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm. Friday’s U.S. non-farm payrolls report, due at 1230 GMT, could determine the pace of future Federal Reserve interest rate rises and the dollar’s direction. Fed chairman Jerome Powell is also speaking later on Friday and investors will be looking for any signs that rates could rise more than expected. Markets predict two further hikes this year after the Fed raised rates last month. The U.S. March employment report is expected to show non-farm payroll growth of 193,000 jobs versus 313,000 the prior month, according to the latest Thomson Reuters poll of economists. Average hourly earnings are expected to have risen 0.2 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in February. The gain would lift the annual increase in average hourly earnings to 2.7 percent from 2.6 percent in February. The dollar was flat against a basket of major currencies with traders reluctant to take big positions ahead of the payrolls numbers. Against the yen, which as a safe haven currency tends to be among the most sensitive to global economic uncertainty, the dollar fell marginally. So far this week the dollar is up almost 1 percent versus the Japanese currency, and on Thursday it hit its highest since late February, despite the growing U.S.-China trade tensions. Some Asian currencies showed signs of investor nervousness, however. The Chinese yuan fell another 0.4 percent versus the dollar , bringing week-to-date losses to 0.8 percent. The Korean won, heavily exposed to global trade, also fell. “The rising tide of economic nationalism is likely to be a motivating theme in markets for the foreseeable future. There is scope for behind-the-scenes pragmatism while sabres get rattled in public, and that is probably the most likely outcome. But the fact is when sabres get rattled, blood sometimes gets spilled,” said Joseph Amato, CIO of equities at Neuberger Berman. Treasury debt prices gained and yields declined. Euro zone government bond yields also dipped as the trade dispute between the United States and China flared. The 10-year Treasury note yield fell marginally to 2.8229 percent, pulling back from Thursday’s nine-day high of 2.838 percent. Treasury yields had fallen further in Asian trading before recovering in European trading. The yield on 10-year German government debt, the euro zone benchmark, slid 1 basis point in early trade to a shade above 0.51 percent. Crude oil prices fell after Trump’s latest tariff proposal. U.S. crude slipped 0.7 percent to $63.09 a barrel and Brent was down 0.6 percent at $67.92 a barrel. Gold prices were steady.

2018-04-06,"(Adds comment from Chevron, details) By Wilda Asmarini JAKARTA, April 6 (Reuters) - Chevron has submitted a proposal to extend its contract to operate the Rokan oil block in Indonesia beyond 2021, Deputy Energy Minister Arcandra Tahar said on Friday. Chevron’s proposal is now being evaluated by upstream oil and gas regulator SKKMigas, Tahar said. The Rokan block is Indonesia’s single largest source of crude oil. “Chevron has been in discussions with the government of Indonesia about the Rokan PSC extension,” said Yanto Sianipar, senior vice president of government affairs at Chevron Indonesia, referring to the company’s production sharing contract (PSC). Chevron continues to work closely with the government of Indonesia on its efforts to help optimise oil recovery and production from this asset, Sianipar told Reuters by text message. Chevron recently received government approval for plans to drill additional wells in six fields (Sidingin, Hitam, Petapahan, Pematang, Ampuh and Sikladi) within the Rokan PSC this year. Chevron said in 2016 it would not extend a contract for the East Kalimantan block it had held for 50 years, following a string of asset cuts by oil and gas companies in Indonesia. “We have decided we will allow others to invest in East Kalimantan and we will focus our efforts where we believe we make a difference in a place like Rokan block and also in IDD,” Chevron IndoAsia Business Unit Managing Director Chuck Taylor told Indonesia’s parliament this week. Tahar said the government was currently evaluating 23 oil and gas contracts due to expire up to 2026, and will prioritise decisions on those expiring soonest, Tahar said. The contract for the Corridor block operated by a unit of ConocoPhillips is due to expire in 2023. Indonesia recently adopted the gross split mechanism for new and expiring oil and gas production sharing contracts, whereby contractors shoulder the cost of exploration and production, rather than being reimbursed by the government. It was not immediately clear if the new mechanism will be applied for Rokan, but based on a ministerial regulation the government can impose the gross split mechanism on contracts being extended.

2018-04-06,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - An Indonesian plan to curb the commercial use of peatlands, by swapping nearly 1 million hectares of forestry concessions on carbon-rich peat, risks simply displacing environmental destruction to other parts of the archipelago, green groups say. Indonesia was blamed for one of the worst ever peat and forest fire crises that blanketed much of Southeast Asia in thick haze in 2015, and since then has sought to take back and protect vast tracts of peatlands from corporations. But environmentalists say a new ‘land swap’ policy - which will affect an area the size of Lebanon - may undermine those efforts if relatively undamaged land is given to companies that in the past have been criticized for unsustainable practices. An Indonesian environment ministry official said under the deal companies will be evaluated over the course of this year to assess how well they have restored damaged peatland on existing concessions before receiving new land elsewhere. “For this land swap, we will look for empty land that is non-productive,” said Hilman Nugroho, a senior official at the environment ministry.  An alliance of 10 environmental organizations said in a joint statement this week that the government was not being open about what land would be exchanged. “We fear that vast areas of natural forest, especially in Kalimantan, Sumatra (island), and Papua will be designated for land swaps and converted into pulpwood plantations in the name of peatland restoration,” the environmental organizations said. Kalimantan is the Indonesian portion of Borneo island.  “The policy will also threaten the livelihoods and cultures of indigenous peoples,” said the statement, which was issued by groups including the World Wildlife Fund Indonesia and Eyes on the Forest. To estimate where potential land concessions would be given away, the alliance compared satellite imagery of forested area with known government allocations of land suitable for plantations and inactive land.   “With this analysis, we found that 971,900 hectares of potential land swap locations are on natural forest area,” said Syarul Fitra of Auriga, one of the NGOs in the alliance.   The government has not made public the locations of the new concessions that will be given as part of the swap. An environment ministry document seen by Reuters showed companies set to receive new land include several companies linked to Singapore-based Asia Pulp and Paper (APP). One of those companies, PT Bumi Mekar Hijau, was in 2016 found guilty by an Indonesian court of illegally setting fires on its concession land in South Sumatra. bit.ly/2IA9NYr A spokesman for APP declined to comment. Bumi Mekar Hijau could not be reached for comment. Indonesian President Joko Widodo approved last year a two-year extension to a moratorium on issuing new licences to use land designated as primary forest and peatland. The country has suffered one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world - often cleared for palm oil and other plantations or pulp and paper mills. In the last half century more than 74 million hectares of Indonesian rainforest - representing an area twice the size of Germany - have been logged, burned or degraded, according to Greenpeace.

Eni and Shell have the biggest stakes in the Karachaganak project, which they jointly operate. “Negotiations on the Karachaganak project are rather active, we meet almost daily, our last meeting was yesterday,” Magzum Mirzagaliyev told reporters. “Because the talks are rather large scale... we have decided to extend the memorandum (on negotiations) until May or June.” Kazakhstan filed a $1.6 billion claim against foreign firms developing the Karachaganak gas condensate field in 2015, one of the companies has said. The Energy Ministry has said the row was over how each party’s share of the field’s output was calculated. Eni and Shell each own 29.25 percent of the Karachaganak project in northwest Kazakhstan, while Kazakhstan’s KazMunayGaz owns 10 percent, Chevron Corp has 18 percent and Lukoil owns 13.5 percent. Last September, Energy Minister Kanat Bozumbayev told Reuters the former Soviet republic had received an offer from the consortium, but considered it insufficient.

2018-04-06,"MUMBAI/NEW DELHI, April 6 (Reuters) - India plans to set up a natural gas trading exchange as early as October this year to prepare for a surge in supply from India’s east coast and a slew of liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals. Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan in a meeting last week with industry officials set a deadline of Oct. 1 for the country’s primary natural gas distribution regulator to set up the exchange, said three sources familiar with the discussions. The exchange is aimed at standardizing natural gas prices, said a government official, a consultant and a gas company executive, so that domestic prices are not set at such a discount to international market rates. India currently imports LNG at global rates LNG-AS of around $7.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), while the government sets domestic gas prices at $3.06 per mmBtu. “If we have proper pricing and market access, then it is easier for the gas sector to develop,” said Atanu Chakraborty, who heads India’s upstream regulator. The exchange will also help to reduce the risks associated with the pricing differences, he said. Details on how the gas exchange will function and how prices will be set were not immediately available. Phone calls to India’s oil ministry for more information have gone unanswered. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has laid out a plan to increase the share of gas in India’s energy mix to 15 percent by 2030 from below 6.5 percent now, Oil Minister Pradhan said at a conference in Thailand last year. India currently produces close to 90 million standard cubic meters per day (mscmd) of gas and imports another 70 mscmd as LNG, according to government figures for 2016-17. In the next three to five years, as natural gas projects from India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corp and a partnership involving BP and Reliance Industries ramp up, India’s domestic gas output will be in the range of 140 mscmd, said Chakraborty. LNG imports are expected to grow to around 50 million tonnes a year (160 mscmd) over the same period, he said, referring to Pradhan’s speech. Sufficient supplies for the smooth operation of a gas exchange are one of the primary concerns. India’s industrial gas consumers such as power plants and fertiliser makers were disappointed in 2010 after promised gas output from the east coast’s Krishna-Godavari basin fell short of expectations. Many facilities that were built in anticipation of more gas production remain stranded without adequate fuel. The Reliance-BP partnership plans to develop three assets off India’s east coast, and state-owned ONGC is developing another gas field in the same region.

2018-04-06,"NAIROBI, April 6 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - It is dawn along the Waiyaki Way highway on the northwest side of Nairobi, but road into town is already packed with traffic of every stripe. As a 14-seater van skids into a bus stop, a young man in denim jeans and a yellow sweatshirt peels out the door, beckoning to passengers looking for a ride to town. The more energetic ones shove their way through the crowd to the vehicle’s doorway. But only one pair manage to squeeze into the two empty passenger seats. Restlessly, the others pull back to wait for the next passenger vehicle. But nearby, a smiling Mercy Njoroge walks briskly by on her own more efficient transport system: Her feet. Njoroge, a mid-career accountant, is among a growing number of the city’s workers who are opting to walk to work, both to avoid the daily traffic scramble and because they want to cut air pollution caused by vehicle emissions. “I have a car but I only use it during weekends because there are fewer people and traffic going into the city,” Njoroge said in an interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “My choice to walk to and from work was inspired by the need to do something about the environment and pollution that is ailing our city,” she said. She walks an impressive eight kilometers each day between her home and her office, at an organisation that lobbies to protect maids and other household workers. But a growing share of Nairobi residents are similarly taking to their feet, though usually over shorter distances. According to the Nairobi county environment department, the city’s middle class is increasingly showing an interest in protecting the environment – and avoiding traffic – with at least one in 10 middle class commuters now walking to work instead of driving. “This is in solidarity to cutting air pollution,” said Mahmoud Dagane, a county executive committee member who has worked on environment and transport issues, at the January launch of a Nairobi beautification programme. More Kenyans living within five kilometers of their jobs need to walk or ride a bicycle to work to reduce the amount of traffic on Nairobi’s roads, he said. Nairobi’s need to get more people out of vehicles is evident in a place where perpetual traffic snarls are a major source of frustration and pollution. From Waiyaki Way highway, a smoggy blanket is visible hanging over downtown Nairobi’s tall buildings, and pockets of trees along the road are covered with traffic soot. Occasionally a pedestrian lets out a dry cough as fumes waft from slow-moving vehicles. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), 6.5 million people die annually around the world due to poor air quality. A 2016 report on the costs of air pollution in Africa, by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), estimated that premature deaths from outdoor air pollution cost African nations $215 billion in 2013. At a press conference in March in Nairobi, Rob De Jong, the head of UNEP’s mobility unit, said transport contributes over half of outdoor air pollution in African cities. “This is made worse because Africa continues to import old vehicles which are known to be heavy emitters of pollutants,” he said. He said a ban should be put in place on importing vehicles over 15 years old. The number of vehicles on Kenya’s roads is increasing, with more than 7,000 a month added in Nairobi alone, or about 90,000 a year, according to the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA), a government agency. Delegates to an Africa Clean Mobility Week event held in Nairobi last month recommended that African countries, including Kenya, begin using more hybrid vehicles – which combine clean electric power with traditional fuel – to cut pollution. Kenya already has reduced the consumption of fuel with high levels of polluting sulphur by tightening diesel import laws, said Jane Akumu, who works on promoting clean fuels and vehicles for Africa at U.N. Environment. But simpler solutions – such as more walking and cycling – are a more sustainable way to cut traffic pollution, she said. Over half of Kenyans already walk or ride a bicycle as transport, Akumu said, but face tough conditions, including a lack of safe and pleasant pathways that avoid traffic. “Why doesn’t the country have good infrastructure for walking and cycling?” she asked. She suggested Kenya build separate lanes along highways for people walking and riding bicycles, preferably lined with fruit trees to provide shade and even an occasional snack. “This can enable Kenya to save in terms of the fuel import bill and also contribute to reduce forces that cause climate change,” Akumu said. “These are the kind of innovations that countries can introduce.” Reporting by Kagondu Njagi ; editing by Laurie Goering :

2018-04-06,"* Trump proposes additional tariffs on China, stocks fall * Equity markets in the red but falls limited * Dollar flat ahead of U.S. jobs report; up on week * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Tommy Wilkes LONDON, April 6 (Reuters) - Stock markets fell on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to impose an extra $100 billion in tariffs on China exacerbated fears of a more serious trade dispute, while the dollar paused ahead of crucial U.S. payrolls data. European shares followed their Asian counterparts into the red but the falls were limited, and the broader ups and downs for markets this week suggest investors are not yet convinced the row will escalate into a full-blown trade war that threatens global economic growth. Britain’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.3 percent while the German Dax was down 0.56 percent and France’s CAC 40 0.41 percent. The MSCI World Index slipped 0.15 percent while S&P 500 E-mini futures were down 1 percent, pointing to a lower start for Wall Street when it opens. In Trump’s latest salvo, he said late on Thursday that he had instructed U.S. trade officials to consider $100 billion in additional tariffs on China. Beijing warned it would fight back “at any cost” with fresh measures to safeguard its interests. “Any escalation in the trade war rhetoric would be more negative for China than the U.S. given the former’s relative dependency on trade but for now, the markets are focused on the payrolls data,” said Richard Falkenhall, a senior currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm. Friday’s U.S. non-farm payrolls report could determine the pace of future Federal Reserve interest rate rises and the dollar’s direction. Fed chairman Jerome Powell is also speaking later on Friday and investors will be looking for any signs that rates could rise more than the expected three hikes priced in for this year. The U.S. March employment report is expected to show non-farm payroll growth of 193,000 jobs versus 313,000 the prior month, according to the latest Thomson Reuters poll of economists. Average hourly earnings are expected to have risen 0.2 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in February. The gain would lift the annual increase in average hourly earnings to 2.7 percent from 2.6 percent in February. “Away from the political noise, the reality is that the fundamental backdrop for markets hasn’t changed – global economic growth is broadly synchronised and interest rates are slowly normalising,” wrote Kerry Craig, Melbourne-based global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. The dollar, which has tended to fall in recent weeks when trade tensions have risen, rose 0.1 percent against a basket of major currencies in early European trading, bringing week-to-date gains to 0.6 percent. Against the yen, which as a safe haven currency tends to be among the most sensitive to global economic uncertainty, the dollar was flat. So far this week the dollar is up 1 percent versus the Japanese currency, hitting its best level since late February, despite growing U.S.-China trade tensions. Some Asian currencies showed signs of investor nervousness, however. The Chinese yuan fell another 0.4 percent versus the dollar , bringing week-to-date losses to 0.8 percent. The Korean won, heavily exposed to global trade, also fell. Treasury debt prices gained and yields declined as investors sought the safety of government bonds. Euro zone government bond yields also dipped as the trade dispute between the United States and China flared. The 10-year Treasury note yield fell 1.1 basis points to 2.821 percent, pulling back from Thursday’s nine-day high of 2.838 percent. Treasury yields had fallen further in Asian trading but the European open brought some calmness to markets. The yield on 10-year German government debt, the euro zone benchmark, slid 2 basis points in early trade to a shade below 0.51 percent, erasing much of Thursday’s rise. Crude oil prices fell after Trump’s latest tariff proposal. O/R U.S. crude slipped 0.5 percent to $63.22 a barrel and Brent was down 0.45 percent at $68 a barrel.

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open lower, with Britain’s FTSE falling 0.5 percent, Germany’s DAX shedding 0.85 percent and France’s CAC losing 0.75 percent. The S&P 500 E-mini futures were down 1 percent, pointing to a lower start for Wall Street later in the session. Trump said late on Thursday that he had instructed U.S. trade officials to consider $100 billion in additional tariffs on China, fuelling the trade dispute between the world’s two economic superpowers. China’s Ministry of Commerce said it would take new comprehensive measures to safeguard the country’s interests if the United States stuck to its protectionist behaviour. “Trump’s order to consider whether $100 billion of additional tariffs would be appropriate, and recent trade actions and rhetoric in recent weeks, is an example of how battles can turn to wars,” said Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co (PIMCO). “This is another reason investors should be reducing risk.” Asian stocks declined early on Friday in a knee-jerk reaction to Trump’s latest tariff proposal but regained a measure of calm following Wall Street’s strong performance overnight. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.15 percent. “Away from the political noise, the reality is that the fundamental backdrop for markets hasn’t changed – global economic growth is broadly synchronised and interest rates are slowly normalising,” wrote Kerry Craig, Melbourne-based global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “Equities are more attractively priced now than they were at the start of the year and the earnings outlook has improved. The noise may be distracting but a solid second quarter U.S. earnings season could see investors refocus on fundamentals and the corporate outlook.” Australian stocks recovered from an earlier drop to rise 0.1 percent. South Korea’s KOSPI lost 0.6 percent. Japan’s Nikkei nudged down 0.1 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng advanced 0.5 percent. The Dow and the S&P 500 posted gains for a third day in a row on Thursday amid the back-and-forth of the U.S.-China trade dispute, with some investor focus turning to upcoming earnings. Beyond the trade turmoil, financial markets are focused on Friday’s U.S. non-farm payrolls report, which could determine the pace of future Federal Reserve interest rate rises and the dollar’s direction. The U.S. March employment report is expected to show non-farm payroll growth of 193,000 jobs versus 313,000 the prior month, according to the latest Thomson Reuters poll of economists.

The gain would lift the annual increase in average hourly earnings to 2.7 percent from 2.6 percent in February. The dollar was little changed at 107.385 yen after earlier falling to 106.990 on Trump’s latest tariff proposal. The dollar had risen to a one-month peak of 107.490 yen overnight, bolstered by Wall Street’s bounce on Thursday when the United States appeared to signal a willingness to resolve the trade dispute. The euro was steady at $1.2243. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was nearly unchanged at 90.453. The index has risen 0.4 percent this week.

2018-04-06,"SEOUL, April 6 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday along with equities as U.S. President Trump’s threat of new tariffs on China reignited fears of a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. President Trump said on Thursday he had ordered U.S. trade officials to consider an additional $100 billion tariffs on China, escalating tensions with China. Brent crude for June delivery was down 38 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $67.95 per barrel by 0143 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery was down 43 cents, or 0.7 percent, at 63.11 a barrel. Shanghai September crude futures were untraded due to public holidays in China, after falling 0.8 percent on Wednesday. Shanghai trading will resume on Monday. While oil market watchers were wary of the brewing trade war between the United States and China, they did not expect to see steep falls amid signs of tightening supplies. “The most recent rumblings from President Trump have seen oil prices fall convincingly, but given the supporting narrative, it should attract some dip buyers,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a 4.6 million-barrel draw in U.S. crude inventories last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 246,000 barrels. “U.S. oil inventories remain a volatile gauge, but they still provide a good litmus test for the short-term,” Innes said. Meanwhile Saudi Arabia said on Thursday it would raise its official selling price for May crude for Asian customers. “The move...suggests that Saudi Arabia is not looking to remove production curbs anytime soon,” ANZ bank said in a note. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC producers including Russia are committed to cutting output by around 1.8 million barrels per day through the end of 2018 in a bid to clear a global overhang and support prices. Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the oil cartel, has said production cuts could be extended in one form or another. OPEC and its allies should keep the cuts to ensure healthy price levels as a way to boost investment in the industry and avoid a supply and price shock in the long run, Qatar’s Energy Minister Mohammed al-Sada told Reuters.

2018-04-06,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the leftist leading the race to win Mexico’s presidency in July, will root out corruption at Pemex and also aims to slim down the state-owned oil and gas company, his pick for finance minister said on Thursday. In an interview with Reuters, Carlos Urzua, a respected economist trained at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said Lopez Obrador was not resolved to end oil and gas auctions started under the current government, but Urzua said major financial investors he had met with were worried about the energy reform. Urzua had harsh words for Pemex, saying it was neither competitive nor productive enough and adding that its trade union is “an icon of corruption.” “Pemex has to be cleaned up, because if not, we’re not going to have a top-flight company,” he said. In office, Urzua said Lopez Obrador’s government would aim to run a federal budget that was “more or less” in balance, once interest payments on debt were stripped out. To meet its other goals of upping investment and pensions, the government would seek to shake up wasteful social spending and curb excessive public sector salaries, he said.  “We’re also going to slim down the structures of all the decentralized institutions, including Pemex,” he said. Lopez Obrador holds a double-digit lead in most opinion polls, and his criticism of the economic liberalisation carried out under President Enrique Pena Nieto has caused concern among influential sections of the business community. The centrepiece of Pena Nieto’s agenda has been opening up oil and gas production and exploration to private firms. Lopez Obrador has strongly criticized the move, threatening to scrap the reform or at least review contracts awarded under it. Urzua sought to downplay fears that the energy overhaul, which was based on a change in the constitution, would be overturned.  “The (auctions) wouldn’t necessarily be cancelled, but they could be halted. Maybe there would be a slower pace,” he said. Urzua, who served as Mexico City’s finance minister for part of Lopez Obrador’s 2000-2005 mayoralty of the capital, added that he was “sure that the great majority of the contracts awarded” had not been tainted by corruption. Lopez Obrador has also rattled business leaders by threatening to scrap a $13 billion new airport for Mexico City, which the government says is already nearly one-third complete. Urzua said foreign investors were not very worried about the airport, noting that its major investors are Mexican. “But they are worried about the energy sector,” he said. Urzua said he has already held meetings with representatives from over 50 major investors in Mexico, including BlackRock, Pimco, Credit Suisse, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley. To eliminate public sector waste and corruption, Urzua said the Lopez Obrador administration would centralize all purchasing of goods and services in the federal government.

2018-04-06,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is willing to negotiate with China on trade, but only if talks are serious, as previous attempts produced little progress, a senior U.S. official told Reuters late on Thursday as trade tensions between the two nations escalated. No formal negotiating sessions have been set, the official said. “There is ongoing communications with the Chinese on trade,” said the official, who requested anonymity to discuss the Trump administration’s trade strategy.     The official said Republican President Donald Trump, who has already sought $50 billion in new tariffs on China, will insist on “verifiable, enforceable and measurable deliverables” from China in any trade negotiations. The comments came as Trump said late on Thursday he had instructed U.S. trade officials to consider $100 billion in additional tariffs on China “in light of China’s unfair retaliation” against earlier U.S. trade actions. In a statement, Trump said the U.S. Trade Representative had determined that China “has repeatedly engaged in practices to unfairly obtain America’s intellectual property.” The senior official said: “We’ve had a type of negotiation in different forums where China has made lots of different commitments that they haven’t followed through on. “We don’t want to go down that path. But the president has been clear, the administration has been clear, we’re not trying to start a trade war. We’re simply trying to get fair and reciprocal treatments so we’re open to those conversations.” The official said China had committed seven times to stopping forced technology transfers, a practice in which China  allegedly seeks to obtain U.S. intellectual property (IP) through joint venture requirements, something that China denies. “This president is not going to tolerate hollow commitments or refusal to change bad practices. And if the way that we effectuate that is through negotiations, that’s great,” the official said. The Trump administration on Tuesday targeted 25 percent tariffs on some 1,300 industrial technology, transport and medical products to try to force changes in Beijing’s IP, sending world financial markets gyrating. China retaliated the next day with a list of duties on U.S. imports including soybeans, planes, cars, beef and chemicals.

The S&P 500 E-mini futures were down 1.45 percent, pointing to a lower start for Wall Street later in the session. Dow futures were down 1.7 percent. The Dow and the S&P 500 posted gains for a third day in a row on Thursday, the longest streak in about a month, as investor fears of an escalating trade conflict between the United States and China abated, turning the focus to upcoming earnings. Trade tensions, however, returned to the fore after Trump said in a statement late on Thursday that he had instructed U.S. trade officials to consider $100 billion in additional tariffs on China “in light of China’s unfair retaliation” against earlier U.S. tariffs. Futures trading pointed to a lower open for Japan’s Nikkei , which had risen 1.5 percent on Thursday. The dollar, which had risen to a one-month high against the yen on Thursday on an earlier easing of trade fears, slipped against its Japanese peer after Trump’s latest trade offensive. The greenback was down 0.3 percent at 107.060 yen, pulling back from 107.490, its highest since March 1. The dollar had risen to a one-month peak versus the yen, bolstered by Wall Street’s bounce on Thursday when the United States appeared to signal a willingness to resolve the trade dispute. The yen, a perceived safe-haven currency, is often sought in times of market turmoil and political tensions. The dollar dipped 0.1 percent to 0.9624 Swiss franc, another safe-haven currency. The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.2251. Beyond the trade turmoil, financial markets are focused on Friday’s U.S. non-farm payrolls report, which could determine the pace of future Federal Reserve interest rate rises and consequently the dollar outlook.

We’re simply trying to get fair and reciprocal treatments so we’re open to those conversations.” The official said China had committed seven times to stopping forced technology transfers, a practice in which China  allegedly seeks to obtain U.S. intellectual property (IP) through joint venture requirements, something that China denies. “This president is not going to tolerate hollow commitments or refusal to change bad practices. And if the way that we effectuate that is through negotiations, that’s great,” the official said. The Trump administration on Tuesday targeted 25 percent tariffs on some 1,300 industrial technology, transport and medical products to try to force changes in Beijing’s IP, sending world financial markets gyrating. China retaliated the next day with a list of duties on U.S. imports including soybeans, planes, cars, beef and chemicals.
