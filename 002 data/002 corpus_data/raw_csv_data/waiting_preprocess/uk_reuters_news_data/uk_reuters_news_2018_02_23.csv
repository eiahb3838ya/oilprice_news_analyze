2018-02-23,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brookfield Energia Renovável SA, a Brazil-based unit of Canada’s  Brookfield Asset Management (BAMa.TO), abandoned a plan to make a capital injection of 1.4 billion reais in Brazil’s Renova Energia SA (RNEW11.SA), which would give it a controlling stake in the company. According to a Renova securities filing on Friday, Brookfield Energia Renovável SA changed its proposal and now is offering only to buy a large wind power complex and other power generation assets held by the Brazilian firm. Brookfield is offering 650 million reais ($200.78 million) plus an earn-out value of 150 million reais to buy the Alto Sertão III wind power complex. It is also offering to buy other wind projects under development for 187,000 reais per megawatt of installed capacity. Renova said it is evaluating the new proposal. It said eventual resources from the deal, if it is accepted, would be used to pay suppliers in the Alto Sertão III complex. Renova had approved in November the initial proposal from Brookfield for the acquisition of a controlling stake in the Brazilian company, which is trying to cut a large debt load.

2018-02-23,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Senior executives are leaving Swiss commodities trader AOT Energy amid a shrinking credit line and losses in some trading operations, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.  The tighter credit lines have prompted the company to consider looking for a partner or selling its business, one of the sources said, adding that the firm has set up a data room for potential buyers to conduct due diligence.  The upheaval comes after the company, controlled by Frère Group, a Belgian holding company owned by billionaire Albert Frère and his family, backed a buyout in 2016 that transferred a 49-percent stake in parent company, AOT Holdings, to management and some employees. The deal also gave the employees an option to buy the remaining stake in future years.  But with Frère Group reducing its holding to 51 percent, banks that had once extended some $2.5 billion in credit to the trading firm lost interest in fully funding the entity, a source close to the matter said, declining to be named.  Officials from AOT Energy and Frère Group did not respond to requests for comments.  Trading shops such as AOT Energy need lines of credit to fund operations.  Amid the turmoil, at least two executives and some traders have left or are leaving the firm, including Lance Perdue, managing director for AOT Energy Americas and U.S. finance chief Anthony Askalany, several sources said on Friday.  Both Perdue and Askalany were based in Houston.  The firm also will shut a recently opened shared-services office in Poland, which provides back office support to trading offices, a source said.  Two sources added that there would also be departures in Europe, although it was not immediately clear how many people would be affected. Commodity trading firms and banks posted major losses in 2017 due to muted client activity and wild fluctuations across energy markets. Bonuses across the industry were low, and some hedge funds have chosen to exit energy trading.

2018-02-23,"BERLIN, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The German government, which has steadfastly opposed bans on heavily-polluting diesel cars in cities, now plans legal changes that would allow driving bans on certain routes on an emergency basis, the Rheinische Post newspaper reported on Saturday. Transportation State Secretary Norbert Barthle, a conservative, disclosed the change of approach in a reply to a parliamentary query by the pro-environment Greens party, the newspaper said. News of the shift comes days before a German court rules on whether cities can implement driving bans that could lower the resale value of up to 15 million vehicles in Europe’s largest car market, forcing car-makers to pay for modifications. Germany’s federal government is under pressure to help 70 cities whose emissions violate EU standards. “A new legal basis is to be established in the road traffic act that would allow ... driving bans or restrictions on certain limited limited routes to protect human health against particulates or emissions (nitrogen oxide),” Barthle said in the reply. “That would make possible for the first time route-limited, emergency measures to protect against particulates,” he said, adding that the changes would make it possible for cities to implement driving bans outside of air pollution plans. He said the changes could be incorporated in revisions now being prepared to provide parking privileges to vehicles operated by car-sharing services, and the entire package of measures could be finalised by the end of the year. Chancellor Angela Merkel said this month she wanted to avoid driving bans by focusing on switching fleets of taxis and buses to electric propulsion, as well as other measures. But she also underscored the need to find solutions quickly for the affected cities. Greens lawmaker Matthias Gastel said the federal government now appeared to view limited driving bans as unavoidable, but was still leaving the issue up to cities and communities. “It’s good to clear up the legal situation, but there’s a danger of a patchwork of widely differing regulations,” he said. Germany’s highest federal administrative court is due to rule on Tuesday on an appeal brought by German states against bans imposed by local courts in Stuttgart and Duesseldorf over poor air quality. There has been a global backlash against diesel-engine cars since Volkswagen admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. exhaust tests, meant to limit emissions of particulate matter and nitrogen oxide (NOx), known to cause respiratory disease. While other countries are also considering restrictions on diesel cars, bans in Germany would be a new blow for the car industry, and an embarrassment for Merkel’s government, which has long backed the industry. Germany for many years promoted diesel to help cut carbon dioxide emissions and meet climate change goals, but the Volkswagen (VW) scandal has pushed its car-makers to step up spending on electric cars, as well as investments into making diesel engines cleaner. Merkel’s government has previously lobbied against bans, fearing they could anger millions of drivers and disrupt traffic.

2018-02-23,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares rose broadly worldwide on Friday, with strong technology stocks and a retreat in Treasury yields lifting Wall Street, while gold had its biggest weekly loss this year as investors shrugged off concerns about interest rate hikes. The dollar edged higher as investors positioned for a more aggressive Federal Reserve to raise U.S. interest rates three times this year. In its semiannual report to Congress released Friday, the Fed’s Washington-based Board of Governors looked past a recent stock market sell-off and inflation concerns, saying it sees steady growth continuing and no serious risks on the horizon that might pause its planned pace of rate hikes. U.S. Treasury yields fell as uncertainty about the recent stock market volatility helped boost bond demand and investors rebalanced portfolios near the month end. “Certainly bond yields pulling back today is helpful for stocks, at least for the short term; that has been the narrative that is out there - that higher bond yields are weighing on stocks,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. “So moving away from that, for today at least, provides a bid for equities.” Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR were last up 14/32 in price to yield 2.8678 percent, down from 2.917 percent late on Thursday. Gains in the dollar pressured the euro. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.16 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.29 percent to $1.2293. Broader concerns have lingered globally over the last few weeks, including how far and fast U.S. interest rates may rise and what that would mean for global borrowing costs, risk appetite and business confidence. The spotlight will be on new Fed Chair Jerome Powell next week when he faces questions from both houses of the U.S. Congress in semi-annual testimony starting on Tuesday.  His audience will include investors who unceremoniously greeted his early tenure with one of the fastest 10.0 percent falls in Wall Street stocks in history this month. In stocks, tech shares .SPLRCT climbed 2.17 percent led by gains in Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE.N), which rose 10.5 percent and HP Inc (HPQ.N), up 3.5 percent. The two companies, created from the split of Hewlett Packard Co in 2015, reported strong results and HPE announced a plan to return $7 billion to shareholders. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 347.51 points, or 1.39 percent, to 25,309.99, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 43.34 points, or 1.60 percent, to 2,747.3 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 127.30 points, or 1.77 percent, to 7,337.39. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 1.14 percent, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rising 0.23 percent and emerging market stocks .MSCIEF up 1.29 percent. Gold’s spot market price XAU= dropped 0.2 percent to $1,328.97 an ounce. It shed about 1.4 percent this week, its biggest weekly decline since early December. “We remain somewhat cautious on gold over the short term given that we think the dollar rally is still not over, especially in the light of U.S. Treasury yields remaining elevated,” said INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir. Oil prices rose to their highest in more than two weeks, supported by the shutdown of the El Feel oilfield in Libya and upbeat comments from Saudi Arabia that an OPEC-led effort to cut stockpiles is working.

2018-02-23,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG’s (VOWG_p.DE) U.S. unit on Friday resolved a lawsuit brought by a North Carolina man whose diesel emissions case was set to be the first go to trial on Monday. The settlement comes days after Virginia state court Judge Bruce White rejected a request by the German automaker to delay the trial over excess emissions because of what it called “inflammatory” comments made by a lawyer representing car owners that it feared would prejudice a jury. White approved the case’s dismissal on Friday. Virginia Lawyer Mike Melkersen, who represents David Doar, the North Carolina man along with more than 300 other U.S. VW diesel owners, said the case had been dismissed by agreement but he declined to disclose the terms. A Volkswagen spokeswoman declined to comment. The first U.S. trial could have resulted in testimony by current and former VW executives and additional negative publicity stemming from the emissions scandal. Doar had sued VW over fraud and unfair trade practice claims and sought punitive damages as well as compensation for the vehicle. Doar bought a 2014 diesel Jetta for $23,700 and had rejected a settlement offer from a 2016 class-action agreement that would have reimbursed him for the value of the vehicle. He had sought $725,000 plus attorneys fees in legal filings. The next trial is set for June 4 involving another diesel owner. Volkswagen said in early February publicity from a Netflix documentary that disclosed the company had jointly sponsored tests exposing monkeys in 2014 to toxic diesel fumes could prejudice its chances of receiving a fair trial. The German carmaker is being sued by some consumers after it admitted in September 2015 to cheating on diesel emissions tests, sparking the biggest business crisis in its history. Nearly all U.S. owners of affected cars agreed to take part in a $25 billion settlement in 2016 in the United States that addressed claims from them, environmental regulators, U.S. states and dealers and included buyback offers and additional compensation for about 500,000 owners. About 2,000 owners, however, opted out and most are pursuing court claims seeking additional compensation. Volkswagen of America had sought a six-month delay after Melkersen was interviewed in the Netlfix documentary about the company testing diesel fumes on monkeys. Volkswagen lawyers said in legal papers that “pretrial publicity has connected (the company) directly with Hitler and the Holocaust,” which they said was not relevant to a trial about claims of consumer fraud. Judge Bruce White had ruled that a fair jury could be seated. “The jurors don’t know much about these cases,” White said Tuesday of high-profile cases.

2018-02-23,"(Corrects paragraph 35 to read “advance class” instead of “H-Class”) By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Last March, executives at General Electric Co’s power-plant business gave Wall Street a surprisingly bullish forecast for the year. Despite flat demand for new natural gas power plants, they said, GE Power’s revenue and profit would rise. Showing data from financial firm Lazard and other sources, their presentation said natural gas, coal and even some nuclear power plants were the lowest-cost producers of electricity on the planet, cheaper than wind or solar. “Gas is the most economical energy source today,” one slide read. In the days following the conference, GE’s shares rose 2 percent. But GE’s forecast turned out to be a mirage. Rather than rising, GE Power’s profit fell 45 percent last year, forcing GE to slash its overall profit outlook and cut its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression. Its shares have plunged more than 50 percent since the March forecast. Former CEO Jeff Immelt was replaced in August. John Flannery, GE’s new chief executive, blamed the forecast, along with poor management and other factors, for the power business meltdown. In January, he warned the pain would continue this year “and potentially be worse than expected.” What GE has not emphasized is that wind and solar now cost substantially less than gas and other conventional energy sources - and have for years, according to a widely respected energy cost report Lazard has published since 2008. For graphic showing energy costs and other details, click: tmsnrt.rs/2Fge6ra GE said Lazard was one data source for its March forecast, which also weighed the high efficiency of GE’s latest gas power plants and other factors. GE said cost “is not the only predictor” of the power source utilities will choose. They may also value the reliability of fossil fuels over wind and solar. “We have a rigorous financial planning process,” GE said in response to questions from Reuters. But according to more than a dozen former executives, rivals and energy experts interviewed by Reuters, GE’s reading of the market left the company deeply vulnerable to the sudden drop in demand for conventional power plants, as sales of wind and solar surged. “There are just fewer gas turbines being bought,” one former GE executive said. “The market is not flat, it’s down.” Power is not GE’s only problem. Its financing arm, GE Capital, took a massive, unexpected charge that contributed to a nearly $10 billion loss in the fourth quarter and prompted U.S. regulators to broaden an ongoing probe of its accounting practices. Profit also fell sharply at GE’s separate oil and gas and locomotive businesses last year, and Flannery has suggested he may break up the company. But power is one of GE’s oldest and largest businesses, and supplied 60 percent of the conglomerate’s profit as recently as 2016. Now, GE is cutting 12,000 jobs, 18 percent of the unit’s workforce, after announcing 6,500 job cuts in early 2016. On Wednesday, GE Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller warned of “a little bit more noise” at GE Power, calling 2018 “a reset and stabilization year” for the division. She declined to predict when GE Power would regain double-digit profit margins it had in 2016, and said turning it around “will take a good 12 to 18 months.” GE doubled down on fossil fuel in 2015 with the $10.3 billion purchase of French group Alstom’s power business. The deal expanded GE’s exposure to gas, coal and nuclear power just as solar costs fell below those of gas-powered plants, according to Lazard. The Alstom deal added 65,000 employees to GE’s payroll and dozens of factories and service centers around the globe at a time when GE was trying to cut costs. Orders for GE’s newest, large gas-fired turbines have fallen 35 percent in the two years since the deal closed, and industry estimates show demand for conventional plants is unlikely to hit 2017 levels again for at least a decade. The cost gap between renewable and conventional power is still widening, and some utilities already are mothballing older fossil plants, using them only to supplement wind and solar. Other companies also were hit by the decline in sales. But competitors Siemens AG and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems were cautious. Paul Browning, Chief Executive of MHPS North America, said his company watched wind and solar power costs fall 12 percent a year for more than a decade. “We did see a lot of this coming and didn’t make acquisitions or build up a lot of facilities, people or inventory,” Browning said in an interview. While Alstom gave GE more than $14 billion more in annual revenue, Alstom’s profit margins were less than one-third of GE’s. Immelt saw that as an opportunity. “If we thought this was a 6 percent margin business that we couldn’t dramatically improve, we are not going to do it,” Immelt said of the Alstom purchase in May 2014. “We are basically in similar businesses in the same market, and we run our business at a 20 percent margin.” But regulators required GE to sell the power-plant service arm of Alstom, a Florida-based company called Power Systems Manufacturing that had long been a competitor to GE, Mitsubishi and Siemens. GE, which had counted on that business serving a large base of plants around the world to make Alstom more profitable, bid aggressively on service deals to avoid losing them to competitors, according to three people familiar with the bidding. That has raised concerns among investors that it is locked into service contracts that will not be profitable. Rather than improving Alstom’s margins, GE Power’s margin plunged to 7.7 percent last year from 21 percent before the acquisition. In response to questions from Reuters, GE said lucrative income from fixing downed power plants fell by half last year, a major hit to profits. But it defended the Alstom purchase, which instantly gave it 50 percent more plants to service, something that would take half a century to build up from scratch. Since it is a long-term business, GE said, and “we have opportunity to improve the performance in the future.” GE’s power plants generate one-third of the world’s electricity, giving it a large installed base for services revenue. But industry experts point out that GE’s gas power plants are mainly older F-Class units, rather than the new, larger H-Class turbines. Older gas-fired plants often cannot compete with wind and solar, especially when governments provide subsidies, said Stuart Slade, director of consulting at market research firm Forecast International. “There are a lot of single-cycle gas plants being mothballed,” Slade said. Alstom inflicted other blows: New Alstom orders fell off in the 18 months before the deal closed as customers held back on purchases. That gave competitors scope to gain market share, according to people familiar with the sales competitions. GE has sold the largest number F-Class power plants. But it is in third place behind Mitsubishi and Siemens in competition for the newest, largest and most fuel-efficient advance class turbines, according to McCoy Power Reports, an industry research company. Orders for all of GE Power’s plants and services have fallen 13 percent since 2016, a decline that accelerated at the end of last year. GE also wrote off some of the equipment it built up as part of an $850 million charge it took in the fourth quarter. GE did not rule out further write offs, in response to questions from Reuters. Miller and GE Power Chief Executive Russell Stokes have said the problems are fixable, and the company acknowledged in a recent strategy paper that wind and solar are a fast-growing part of the world’s energy supply. Still, GE downplays the threat to its bulked up fossil fuel product line. Despite rapid growth of wind and solar, it says, two-thirds of power generation will come from gas, coal and nuclear plants over the next decade. “The transformation will not happen overnight,” GE said in the strategy paper.

2018-02-23,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Friday to their highest in more than two weeks, supported by the shutdown of the El Feel oilfield in Libya and upbeat comments from Saudi Arabia that an OPEC-led effort to cut stockpiles is working. El Feel produces 70,000 barrels per day of crude. Production in OPEC member Libya has been running at about 1 million bpd, although it remains volatile due to unrest.  “Libya is another outage,” said John Kilduff, partner at investment manager Again Capital in New York. “This market has benefited from a series of them over the past several months now, whether it’s the Keystone, the North Sea (Forties), and now this.” Brent crude futures rose 92 cents to settle at $67.31 a barrel, a 1.4 percent gain. The global benchmark’s session high of $67.37 was its highest since Feb. 7. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 78 cents to settle at $63.55 a barrel, trading between $62.33 and $63.73. Both benchmarks notched their second straight week of gains. Brent was up about 3.7 percent, its largest weekly increase since the end of October. U.S. benchmark WTI posted a weekly rise of about 3 percent. Prices were buoyed by comments from Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Khalid al-Falih, who said he expected oil market inventories to continue declining. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers including Russia have cut output to support prices. They hope to reduce crude inventories held by industrialized nations to their five-year average.     Prices pared gains in the afternoon after General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said the number of oil rigs in the United States rose for the fifth straight week to 799. [RIG/U] Rising U.S. production has hindered OPEC’s efforts to drain supplies.  On Thursday, data from the Energy Information Administration showed that U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly fell 1.6 million barrels last week. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. futures fell 2.7 million barrels last week. Analysts also said prices were following through a more than 1.5 percent rise on Thursday.  “Yesterday’s shock that it was a drawdown, and also a large drawdown at Cushing, really provided that lift that we needed,” said Phillip Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago.  U.S. crude exports are rising with output. Thursday’s EIA data showed exports of U.S. crude jumped to just above 2 million bpd, close to a record 2.1 million hit in October. “Robust oil production in the U.S. will continue to cap price gains,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London. Hedge funds and money managers upped their bullish wagers on U.S. crude oil for the first time in four weeks, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday. The group raised their combined futures and options position in New York and London by 478 contracts to 478,160 in the week to Feb. 20, the CFTC said.

2018-02-23,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Cyprus accused Turkey on Friday of threatening to use force against a drillship chartered by Italy’s Eni, in a standoff over hydrocarbons rights in the eastern Mediterranean. There was no immediate reaction from Turkey, which has vowed to prevent Greek Cypriots from exploring for oil or gas around the ethnically-split island. Turkey says some areas of Cyprus’s offshore maritime zone fall under its jurisdiction. On Feb. 9, the Turkish navy on manoeuvres in the Mediterranean stopped the Saipem 12000 vessel on its way to drill for gas in the waters off Cyprus, triggering a diplomatic standoff that has underscored tensions in the region over competing claims for offshore resources. Deputy government spokesman Victoras Papadopoulos told the Cyprus News Agency on Friday the ship was heading to the same area, when five Turkish vessels interrupted its course. “The drillship was halted by five Turkish warships and after threats of violence launched (by the Turkish side) and the threat of a collision with the drillship ... the drillship was compelled to return back,” he said. Turkey, which does not have diplomatic relations with European Union-member Cyprus, this week extended military exercises in the eastern Mediterranean to March 10.  The Saipem 12000 vessel was on its way to Morocco, an Eni spokesman said. Its chief executive said on Thursday it was very likely the drilling ship would have to be moved to a new location in the coming days. Local media reported earlier on Friday it was heading to Limassol in Cyprus.  Cyprus will officially protest to international forums over the latest incident, Papadopooulos said. Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades addressed his fellow European Union leaders on Friday in Brussels on the issue. He said this week that Cyprus was determined to press ahead with its plans for oil and gas exploration. EU leaders expressed solidarity with Cyprus and European Council President Donald Tusk said the bloc was calling on Turkey to stop activities that have led to recent incidents. Eni and France’s Total discovered this month a promising natural gas field off Cyprus, which they said looked geologically similar to the mammoth Zohr field off Egypt.   Cyprus was split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup. Peace talks collapsed last year. Greek Cypriots, who are exploring for natural gas, run Cyprus’s internationally recognised government. Turkish Cypriots run a breakaway state in north Cyprus recognised only by Ankara.

2018-02-23,"* Shares in U.S., Europe, Asia all higher * U.S. dollar ticks up, denting euro * Gold heading for biggest weekly drop since December (Adds settled oil prices; updates throughout) By Hilary Russ NEW YORK, Feb 23 (Reuters) - World shares rose broadly on Friday, with technology stocks lifting Wall Street, while gold neared its biggest weekly loss this year as investors shrugged off concerns about interest rate hikes and the U.S. dollar rose. Stocks climbed across Asia and Europe, while soaring shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc helped the U.S. technology sector surge. The dollar edged higher against a basket of major currencies as investors positioned for a more aggressive U.S. Federal Reserve. The gains in the dollar pressured the euro, putting it on track for its second biggest weekly loss in nearly four months. The dollar index rose 0.2 percent, with the euro down 0.33 percent to $1.2288. Broader concerns have lingered globally over the last few weeks, including how far and fast U.S. interest rates may rise and what would that mean for global borrowing costs, risk appetite and business confidence. Those factors helped keep yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes near four-year highs this week, although yields started falling on Thursday and continued to slump. The 10-year note last rose 15/32 in price to yield 2.8641 percent, from 2.917 percent late on Thursday. “We think the (Federal Reserve) could well put U.S. rates up four times this year, but even then it only takes U.S. rates to 2.5 (percent) by the end of the year,” said JPMorgan Asset Management global strategist Mike Bell. “So the question is, Would they continue at that pace in 2019?” The spotlight will be on new Fed chair Jerome Powell next week when he faces questions from both houses of the U.S. Congress in semi-annual testimony starting on Tuesday. His audience will include investors who unceremoniously greeted his early tenure with one of the fastest 10.0 percent falls in Wall Street stocks in history earlier this month. The pullback in Treasury yields as the Fed eased concerns about the path of interest rate hikes this year drove Wall Street stocks higher. Tech shares climbed 1.69 percent, led by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which rose 10.2 percent, and HP, up 3.2 percent. The two companies, created from the split of Hewlett Packard Co in 2015, reported strong results and HPE announced a plan to return $7 billion to shareholders. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 159 points, or 0.64 percent, to 25,121.48, the S&P 500 gained 25.03 points, or 0.93 percent, to 2,728.99, and the Nasdaq Composite added 78.88 points, or 1.09 percent, to 7,288.96. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.77 percent, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rising 0.23 percent and emerging market stocks up 1.28 percent. In Asian trading, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.28 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.72 percent.. Gold’s spot market price dropped 0.2 percent to $1,329.11 an ounce. It has so far shed about 1.4 percent this week, its biggest weekly decline since early December. “We remain somewhat cautious on gold over the short term given that we think the dollar rally is still not over, especially in the light of U.S. Treasury yields remaining elevated,” said INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir. Oil edged further upwards, supported by a dip in Libyan production and upbeat comments from Saudi Arabia that an OPEC-led effort to curb output is working. U.S. crude oil futures settled at $63.55 per barrel, up 78 cents, or 1.24 percent. Brent was last at $67.35, up 1.45 percent on the day. Additional reporting by Marc Jones and Jan Harvey in London,

2018-02-23,"Feb 23 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies added one oil rig this week, the fifth weekly increase in a row, as oil prices hovered at two-week highs. Drillers added one oil rig in the week to Feb. 23, bringing the total count up to 799, the highest level since April 2015, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI That was the first time since June that drillers added rigs for five consecutive weeks. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is much higher than a year ago when 602 rigs were active as energy companies have continued to boost spending since mid-2016 when crude prices began recovering from a two-year crash. U.S. crude futures traded near $63 a barrel on Friday, moving close to the peaks from late January when prices rose to their highest since December 2014. That compares with averages of $50.85 in 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Looking ahead, futures were trading at near $62 for the balance of 2018 and $57 for calendar 2019. In anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than 2017, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said 53 of the roughly 65 exploration and production (E&P) companies they track, including Apache Corp, have already provided capital expenditure guidance indicating a 9 percent increase in planned spending over 2017. U.S. shale oil producer Apache this week said it would spend 70 percent of its $3 billion capital budget for this year on drilling wells in the Permian, which is at the heart of the U.S. shale boom. About $500 million of that will be spend on pipelines through Alpine High. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks planned to spend about $66.1 billion on drilling and completions in the lower 48 U.S. states in 2017, about 53 percent over what they planned to spend in 2016. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week kept their forecast for the total oil and natural gas rig count nearly unchanged to an average of 1,015 in 2018 and 1,128 in 2019. Last week, they forecast 1,014 in 2018 and 1,128 in 2019. There were 978 oil and natural gas rigs active on Feb. 23. On average, there were 876 rigs available for service in 2017, 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. Most rigs produce both oil and gas.

2018-02-23,"BOGOTA, Feb 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Whether grappling with rising sea levels, drought or floods, mayors of cities worldwide are increasingly on the frontline of efforts to help communities prepare better for the impacts of climate change as it hikes the risk of disasters. With cities home to over half the world’s population and producing more than 80 percent of global economic output, mayors are also driving climate action by adopting renewable energy and cleaner methods of transport. Jenny Durkan, mayor of the U.S. city of Seattle, said U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to walk away from the Paris Agreement, a global pact to curb climate change, and his support for fossil fuels have prompted city leaders to step up. “Mayors have been galvanised in America, and now will be taking more unified steps than perhaps they would have been when they had to rely on federal partners,” Durkan, a former U.S. attorney, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone. “Our federal government unfortunately has completely backed away from all their commitments (on climate change) ... so the leadership on this front has to come from state and local government,” she added. Seattle, a port city with low-lying areas, already faces worsening flood risk due to higher seas and more frequent torrential rains, exacerbated by global warming, Durkan said. “Climate change is huge for us. We’ve had extreme weather conditions shifting,” she said. “Cities are not going to wait.” To help curb climate change, Seattle is focused on cutting carbon emissions by promoting clean energy and a green economy, a key source of jobs, Durkan said. This means a move away from burning fossil fuels - which scientists say is one of the lead causes of climate change - towards renewable sources of power. Durkan highlighted her city’s drive to get more electric cars on the road, with the recent launch of new electric vehicle charging stations and parking areas. Taxis are next on the list. Initiatives to curb climate change and make cities more resilient to disaster threats will be on the agenda at a meeting of mayors and business leaders in Mexico City next week. Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski, one of a group of female mayors attending the second Women4Climate conference organised by the C40 urban climate change alliance, said a shift in snowfall patterns is one way the U.S. city is experiencing climate change, which could lead to drought. “We’re already talking about what we need to do on making sure that we have enough water for the year,” including cutting down water usage over the spring time, said Biskupski, a former Utah Democratic state lawmaker. Salt Lake City is gradually switching from coal as a source of power to renewables like solar, and is on track to meet its goal of using 100 percent renewable energy by 2032, she said. As part of that process, it will be necessary to replace jobs in communities that have relied on the coal industry for employment, she added. In Latin America, making cities more resilient is a priority as they are home to about 80 percent of the population in the world’s most urbanised region, according to the United Nations. Common challenges facing Latin American mayors are how to contain urban sprawl, combat traffic gridlock and cut high pollution levels. But with the world’s most violent cities and highest murder rates, building resilience in the region goes beyond heading off disasters like floods to coping with social stresses. “The focus on crime in Latin America is still very high,” said Isabel Beltran, associate director for Latin America and the Caribbean with 100 Resilient Cities, a project backed by The Rockefeller Foundation to help cities face up to modern-day pressures. “Crime erodes resilience and the social fabric of the city.” Mayors, she said, have the power to “implement change” and strengthen their cities, but more investment is needed. “One of the challenges is to have a line of budget dedicated to resilience,” Beltran said. For Maurice Armitage, mayor of Cali, Colombia’s third-largest city, wider access to education is key to fighting crime, and in turn making the city safer. That involves getting young men off the streets, away from gangs, and into schools and job training schemes. Armitage’s administration is investing heavily in building 150 new schools with earthquake-resistant features. In addition, the city is working on social problems. ""Our jails are full, our cemeteries are full - we have to stop that,"" he said.

2018-02-23,"SOFIA (Reuters) - Czech power utility CEZ (CEZP.PR) signed a contract on Friday to sell its Bulgarian assets to Bulgarian company Inercom, hours after the Bulgarian energy minister resigned over her links to Inercom.  Under the deal, Inercom Bulgaria will take over an energy distributor that provides electricity to over 3 million people in the north west of the country, an energy trader and several renewable energy assets. The sale, estimated at about 320 million euros ($394 million), raised concerns among lawmakers across political parties in Bulgaria about the ability of the little-known company to finance and operate strategic power assets.     Electricity costs are politically sensitive in the Balkan country of 7.1 million people, which also ranks as the most corrupt European Union member state, according to Transparency International. Energy Minister Temenuzhka Petkova resigned after confirming she had known the owners of Inercom for over 20 years, but she denied any wrongdoing.  Speaking to reporters in Brussels, Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said he would accept Petkova’s resignation to assuage any doubts that his government had any say in the deal. “I want to confirm ... (the government) had not influenced that deal in any way,” he said. Borisov said the country’s energy, financial and anti-trust regulators, as well as the intelligence services, would look closely into the deal, including the origin of the funds for the transaction. Inercom, part of a group that has activities in construction and solar energy, said it was aware of the social importance of the business it will acquire and pledged to work transparently and responsibly.  “We have proved that we have the experience and capacity to acquire and manage companies in Bulgaria,” it said.  Inercom also said it planned to make a tender offer to the minority shareholders in CEZ Electro 1CZ.BB and CEZ Razpredelenie 3CZ.BB, once it gets a green light from the Bulgarian anti-trust regulator.  The head of the parliament energy commission Delyan Dobrev however questioned the ability of Inercom to manage an energy business with an annual revenue of about 1.8 billion levs ($1.13 billion). “Initially it sounded like fake news to me,” Dobrev told NOVA television. “How a company that I have not heard of until yesterday will take over one third of the power distribution network in Bulgaria?” he said. The opposition Socialists criticized the deal, urging the government and the president to take a stand. Volen Siderov, one of the leaders of the government’s junior coalition partner, urged the prosecutors and anti-corruption authorities to scrutinize the deal.

2018-02-23,"* Shares in U.S., Europe, Asia all higher * U.S. dollar ticks up, denting euro * Gold heading for biggest weekly drop since December * Russia waits on S&P investment grade rating decision (Adds Wall Street open; changes dateline to New York; updates throughout) By Hilary Russ NEW YORK, Feb 23 (Reuters) - World shares rose broadly on Friday, with technology stocks lifting Wall Street, and gold neared its biggest weekly loss this year as investors shrugged off concerns about interest rate hikes and the U.S. dollar dipped. Stocks climbed across Asia and Europe, while soaring shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc helped the U.S. technology sector surge. MSCI’s key index of stock markets across the globe gained 0.61 percent, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rising 0.19 percent and emerging market stocks up 1.12 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 164.91 points, or 0.66 percent, to 25,127.39, the S&P 500 gained 20.65 points, or 0.76 percent, to 2,724.61 and the Nasdaq Composite added 54.12 points, or 0.75 percent, to 7,264.20. Modest gains for the U.S. dollar meant the euro was set to post its second biggest weekly loss in nearly four months . The dollar index rose 0.22 percent, with the euro down 0.36 percent to $1.2284. Caution over the Italian election also gave the country’s bonds a tough week. Polls point to a hung parliament in Italy, where no single party or coalition has an outright majority to form a government, and analysts expect short-term volatility that could weigh on traditionally sensitive euro zone markets. “Some long-forgotten patterns return to euro bond markets with Bunds rallying while Italy sells off,” said Commerzbank rates strategist Christoph Rieger. Broader concerns have lingered globally over the last choppy few weeks, including how far and fast U.S. interest rates may rise and what would that mean for global borrowing costs, risk appetite and business confidence. Those factors helped keep yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes near four-year highs this week, although yields dropped slightly on Friday. The 10-year notes last rose 11/32 in price to yield 2.8787 percent, from 2.917 percent late on Thursday. “We think the (Federal Reserve) could well put U.S. rates up four times this year but even then it only takes U.S. rates to 2.5 by the end of the year,” said JPMorgan Asset Management global strategist Mike Bell. “So the question is would they continue at that pace in 2019?” In Asian trading, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.21 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.72 percent. Gold’s spot market price dropped 0.3 percent to $1,327.92 an ounce. It has so far shed about 1.5 percent this week, its biggest weekly decline since early December. “We remain somewhat cautious on gold over the short term given that we think the dollar rally is still not over, especially in the light of U.S. Treasury yields remaining elevated,” said INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir. Oil edged further upwards, supported by a dip in Libyan production and upbeat comments from Saudi Arabia that an OPEC-led effort to curb output is working. U.S. crude rose 1.21 percent to $63.53 per barrel and Brent was last at $67.07, up 1.02 percent on the day. Additional reporting by Marc Jones and Jan Harvey in London,

2018-02-23,"* Gupta brothers are friends of ousted president Zuma * Under investigation over alleged corrupt links to Zuma * Workers at their coal mines worried over salaries (Recasts with Gupta companies filing for creditor protection) By James Macharia JOHANNESBURG, Feb 23 (Reuters) - At least eight companies owned by the wealthy Gupta family accused of corrupt ties to former president Jacob Zuma, have filed for protection from creditors, documents showed on Friday. The Indian-born billionaire business associates of Zuma, were accused of using their political connections to win state contracts and influence cabinet appointments, in a report by an anti-graft watchdog in 2016. Zuma and the Gupta brothers deny any wrongdoing. The Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC), South Africa’s companies registry office, shows on its website that eight firms owned by the Gupta’s sought protection from creditors on Feb. 20, including Optimum Coal mine, which has faced a strike by its workers this week over unpaid salaries. Another mining operation, Koornfontein Mine, is also listed, along with Optimum Coal Terminal and Tegeta Exploration and Resources in the coal sector. “It was inevitable that the empire would implode,” Ben Theron, chief operating officer of the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse whistleblower group said in a statement. The other firms are Shiva Uranium, VR Laser, Islandsite Investments One Hundred and Eighty, Confident Cocepts. Last week, South Africa’s elite police unit, the Hawks, raided Gupta properties as part of investigations into their alleged corrupt dealings. Ajay Gupta was declared “a fugitive from justice” by South Africa’s chief prosecutor last week after he failed to report to police investigating corruption allegations. South Africa’s National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said its members had not been paid on time at the Gupta’s Optimum coal mine and would not return to work. It also said more than 500 workers will strike on Monday at Koornfontein Mine over pay. NUM spokesman Livhuwani Mammburu said the union’s members were concerned the non-payment of salaries was linked to India’s Bank of Baroda cutting ties with the Gupta family’s operations. Baroda was the last bank to service Gupta companies. South Africa’s main commercial banks have all cut ties with the Guptas, citing reputational risk. “The guys were not paid and they want a meeting with the CEO because they are concerned about the business rescue proceedings which they were not informed about,” Mammburu said, referring to workers at Optimum Coal. The Optimum Coal mine supplies the fossil fuel to the Hendrina power station, while Koornfontein feeds coal to Eskom’s Komati power station. Both are part of the network of state-run utility Eskom which provides virtually all of the electricity for Africa’s most industrialised economy.

2018-02-23,"OSLO (Reuters) - The world will need sweeping changes over the next 20 years ranging from energy use to food production to achieve climate goals set by almost 200 nations, the new heads of a top environmental think-tank said on Friday. Both said “revolutions” were needed to tackle climate change, such as capturing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants that burn fossil fuels or by reforming agriculture, where meat production and fertilisers are big sources of greenhouse gases. Developed nations should set an example, such as Germany where Chancellor Angela Merkel is under pressure to end the use of coal in power generation. “When Germany is not in a position to phase out coal can we expect that Poland or Indonesia or Vietnam or Turkey ... can phase out coal?” Ottmar Edenhofer, new co-director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, told Reuters. Edenhofer, formerly the institute’s chief economist, and new co-director Johan Rockstrom, a Swedish scientist, said governments were far from achieving the core goal in the 2015 Paris Agreement of limiting a rise in global average temperatures to “well below” two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. “We have just literally 20 years to either succeed or fail” in the goals of getting the planet on a more sustainable path, Rockstrom said in a joint telephone interview. The University of Pennsylvania rated the Potsdam Institute as the world’s top environment policy think-tank this month. The institute plans to exploit more data to try to grasp under-appreciated long-term harm from natural disasters linked to climate change such as floods, droughts or storms. Poor families in developing nations often focus, for instance, on rebuilding their homes after a natural disaster but sometimes stopped sending their children to school even after reconstruction, Edenhofer said. The institute could use more satellite data, for instance the amount of light emitted at night by villages in developing nations, as a gauge of local poverty and vulnerability, he said. The poorest have the least access to electricity. Rockstrom and Edenhofer were named by the institute on Friday to succeed Hans Joachim Schellnhuber in October.

2018-02-23,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romanian chemicals producer Chimcomplex ROCHOB.BX plans to build on its acquisition of rival Oltchim to boost turnover to roughly 300 million euros ($369 million) by 2020, its board chairman Virgiliu Bancila said on Friday. Oltchim ROOLT.BX was forced into insolvency in 2013 after suffering from the closure of a petrochemical refinery, outdated infrastructure and poor management. Its court-appointed manager put its assets up for sale last year. Chimcomplex, which has a market capitalization of 376 million lei ($100 million) and is among the largest privately-owned Romanian chemical plants, won the auction for six assets for 127 million euros before value added tax. Bancila estimated the acquisition would be finalised by early July at the latest. “From that very moment we will start to use the assets and integrate them into Chimcomplex,” Bancila said. “We have an investment plan estimated at 70 million euros for the first three years.” The goal is to create an integrated chemicals maker modeled after regional firms such as Poland’s Grupa Azoty, and revive Romania’s chemical industry. Oltchim’s total turnover - including its other assets - was 969.9 million lei in 2017, while Chimcomplex, which has yet to release full-year results, posted turnover of 115.37 million lei for the first half of 2017.  The firms’ flagship products are chlorosodics, which are used to make soaps, pesticides and plastics, and polyether. Chimcomplex currently exports around 60-65 percent of its output to Moldova, Ukraine, Turkey, Israel and other states, said Bancila, who predicts domestic consumption will rise. “We are at a stage where Romania imports large quantities of chemical products,” he said. “There is more than enough market for our products ... and there is enough room to raise production.” Bancila said the company would embark on an ambitious development and expansion program from 2020, with the goal of boosting turnover to more than 650 million euros within five years.  The expansion would be driven by relaunching Oltchim’s production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which will require investment of up to 300 million euros. Chimcomplex was also analyzing the possibility of merging with or acquiring chemical fertilizer plants currently in insolvency. Bancila said the company could consider raising capital on the bourse after 2020 to help finance its investments. “After the IT sector, Romania’s chemical industry has the second-largest growth potential,” Bancila said. “It has the all resources, energy, gas, minerals, industrial platforms, labor force and plenty of market, what more could it need?” Reporting by Luiza Ilie; Editing by Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/romania-chemicals-chimcomplex/interview-romanias-chimcomplex-plans-expansion-drive-after-acquisition-idUKL8N1QD4OU,23 Feb 2018,"Romanian chemicals producer

2018-02-23,"TEPIC, Mexico, Feb 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - I ndustry’s dependence on polluting fossil fuels is at odds with a “revolution” in transport and renewable energy, and could stop the world doing a crucial U-turn on rising emissions of climate-changing gases by 2020, a former U.N. climate chief warned. Christiana Figueres, who oversaw work on the 2015 Paris Agreement to tackle global warming, now leads “Mission 2020”, an international initiative that seeks to put greenhouse gas emissions on a downward path by 2020. “We’re definitely not on track with everything to do with heavy industry that continues to depend on intense, high-carbon electricity, and we’re not on track with land use,” said Figueres, former executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. “So what happens if we don’t get there is we increase our risk and increase the exposure to extreme weather events,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview. The transport and energy sectors are expected to meet the 2020 deadline as a result of more efficient, cleaner transportation and a plunge in the cost of generating renewable power, Figueres said. Putting a price on carbon and working out ways to pay for environmental services could also yield benefits, alongside incentives to improve land use by restoring degraded soils or boosting reforestation, she said. The Paris Agreement set a goal of keeping the rise in average global temperatures to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times, and ideally to 1.5 degrees. “Science has warned us that if we do not get to that point and begin to bend (the emissions curve), we will have accelerated, negative impacts of climate change,” Figueres said. Despite the challenges to the Mission 2020 goal, Figueres cautioned against relying on controversial “geoengineering” techniques to try to cool the planet’s temperature. So-called “negative emissions” technologies - to suck carbon back out of the atmosphere - could involve capturing gases and storing them underground or fertilising oceans to make them absorb more carbon dioxide. Other techniques being discussed include mimicking the planet-cooling activity of volcanoes by spraying chemicals into the Earth’s upper atmosphere. Many scientists fear those methods could be risky, have limited success and distract from urgent efforts to cut emissions. “Our biosphere, our forests, our whole plant kingdom is the best (carbon) absorption mechanism we have on this planet - it’s the safest, it doesn’t have any negative impacts and we just have not yet extracted all the benefits,” said Figueres. “Before we go to industrial or chemical engineering – the side (effects) of which we have no idea, the cost of which we have no idea, I would prefer to first exhaust the possibility of all the technologies we do know.” Figueres, from Costa Rica, will join female mayors in Mexico City on Monday for the second Women4Climate conference organised by the C40 urban climate change alliance. The meeting will bring together mayors and business leaders to discuss the role women can play in curbing climate change and making communities more resilient to its impacts. A push by cities in the United States to join states and corporations in moving forward with action to tackle climate change is a counterbalance to President Donald Trump’s decision to pull his country out of the Paris deal, said Figueres. “The United States is in a whopping collection of one country, the only country in the world, that has said it would like to leave the Paris Agreement,” she said. “It has had a minimal impact internationally as no other country has decided to follow suit,” she added. At the individual level, more people could be spurred to take climate action by highlighting the benefits clean technology can bring, which are poised to be even more significant than with the communications boom, she said. ""People tend to think it's complex, it's unfixable, somebody else should do it,"" said Figueres. ""(But) this is the most exciting thing that has happened to us in a long time.""

2018-02-23,"* Dollar on pace for a weekly gain of 0.9 pct * Euro weaker as political risks loom (Updates throughout to U.S. market open, changes dateline; previous LONDON) By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed NEW YORK, Feb 23 (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher against a basket of major currencies on Friday, extending its recovery from a three-year low last week, as the potential for a more aggressive U.S. Federal Reserve prompted investors to pare bearish bets against the greenback. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.19 percent at 89.904. The index hit a three-year low of 88.253 on Feb 16. Rising Treasury yields, a view that the dollar’s sell-off had been overdone, and minutes from the Fed’s January rate-setting meeting that offered a relatively upbeat tone helped the index notch a gain of 0.9 percent this week. “You have seen sentiment around the dollar shift,” said Charles Tomes, senior investment analyst and trader at Manulife Asset Management, in Boston. “A lot of market participants are taking some risk off the table if they did have longs in other strategies,” he said. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s first semi-annual testimony to Congress on Tuesday will be watched for any update on the central bank’s economic forecasts. “If investors were short the U.S. dollar, they don’t want to take on that risk in case he is more hawkish,” Tomes said. On Friday, commentary from a host of Fed speakers, including New York Fed President William Dudley, and the Cleveland Fed’s Loretta Mester and their San Francisco counterpart, John Williams, all members of the rate-setting committee this year, could offer insights into the Fed’s thinking on monetary policy. The euro edged lower against the dollar, pressured by the greenback’s stronger tone and by investor caution ahead of the outcome of the Italian general election on March 4. A German Social Democrats’ poll of its members on joining another coalition government with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives is also due that day, two big political risk events for markets. “For people that are bullish on the euro, there is nothing new to get people to increase positions,” he said. The Australian and New Zealand dollars slipped as investors bet interest rates in the two countries will remain at record lows while the United States continues to tighten policy. The Canadian dollar edged higher against its broadly firmer U.S. counterpart after data showed Canada’s inflation cooled less than economists had expected.

2018-02-23,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has called a meeting early next week with key senators and Cabinet officials to discuss potential changes to biofuels policy, which is coming under increasing pressure after a Pennsylvania refiner blamed the regulation for its bankruptcy, according to four sources familiar with the matter. The meeting comes as the oil industry and corn lobby – powerful forces in Washington – clash over the future of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a decade-old regulation that requires refiners to cover the cost of mixing biofuels such as corn-based ethanol into their fuel. Trump’s engagement reflects the high political stakes of protecting jobs in a key electoral state. Oil refiner Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES), which employs more than a thousand people in Philadelphia, declared bankruptcy last month and blamed the regulation for its demise. The meeting, scheduled for Tuesday, will include Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa, along with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, and potentially Energy Secretary Rick Perry, according to the four sources, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. One source said the meeting would focus on short-term solutions to help PES continue operating. PES is asking a bankruptcy judge to shed roughly $350 million of its current RFS compliance costs, owed to the EPA which administers the program, as part of its restructuring package. The other sources said the meeting will consider whether to cap prices for biofuel credits called RINs, let higher-ethanol blends be sold all year, and efforts to get speculators out of the market. Prices for ethanol RIN credits were trading at 62 cents each on Friday morning, down from 66 cents each on Thursday, according to traders. Officials at the EPA, Agriculture Department, and Energy Department declined to comment. A White House official, Kelly Love, said she had no announcement on the matter at this time. The offices of Cruz, Ernst and Grassley did not immediately return requests for comment.  The sources said the options moving forward would be constrained by political and legal realities that have derailed previous efforts at reform. The Trump administration has already considered changes to the RFS sought by refiners this year - including reducing the amount of biofuels required to be blended annually under the regulation, or shifting the responsibility for blending to supply terminals - only to retreat in the face of opposition from corn-state lawmakers. The EPA is expected to weigh in officially in the coming weeks on PES’s request to the bankruptcy judge to be released from its compliance obligations. But any such move would likely draw a backlash from other U.S. refiners, who have no hope of receiving a waiver. Under the RFS, refiners must earn or purchase blending credits to prove they are complying with the regulation. As biofuels volumes quotas have increased, so have prices for the credits - meaning refiners that invested in blending facilities have benefited while those that have not, such as PES, have had to pay up. PES said its RFS compliance costs exceeded its payroll last year, and ranked only behind the cost of purchasing crude oil. Other issues may have contributed to PES’s financial difficulties. Reuters reported that PES’s investor backers withdrew from the company more than $594 million in a series of dividend-style distributions since 2012, even as regional refining economics slumped. Regulators and lawmakers have been considering how to cut the cost of the RFS to the oil industry. In recent months, for example, the EPA has contemplated expanding its use of an exemption available to small refineries - a move that would likely push down RIN prices, but which both the oil and corn industries have said would be unfair.  Cruz last year proposed limiting the price of RINs to 10 cents, a fraction of their current value – an idea that was roundly rejected by the ethanol industry as a disincentive for new ethanol blending infrastructure investment.     Senator John Cornyn, also a Texas Republican, is preparing draft legislation to overhaul the RFS in Congress that would include the creation of a new specialized RIN credit intended to push down prices - but it too faces resistance from both the corn and oil lobbies.

2018-02-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prices in Europe’s biggest gas markets surged 50 percent this week ahead of a cold snap that will test the region’s reduced supply options and make price spikes more likely as stocks run low.  A late winter blast of cold in north-west Europe has left traders scrambling for gas in British, Dutch, Belgian and French markets after several setbacks to quick sources of supply in the region. These include new limits on output at Europe’s biggest gas field in Groningen, the Netherlands, and utility Centrica’s (CNA.L) decision to close Britain’s biggest gas storage site.  Gas stockpiles held in underground sites in Britain, Belgium and France are at their lowest since at least 2015 and liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments are scant following increased demand from Asia.  In Britain, day-ahead TRGBNBPD1 gas prices rose near 50 percent this week as plummeting temperatures boosted demand for gas which is used to heat up to 80 percent of the country’s homes.  Traders said demand next week could reach the highest since 2010, when Britain saw near record demand as temperatures in some parts of the country fell below minus 20 degrees Celsius. France, Belgium and the Netherlands face similar challenges.  “A cold easterly flow will bring increasingly colder air from north-eastern Europe,” meteorologist Georg Muller said.  Britain’s gas market in particular is bracing. “The UK is much more at risk to spiking prices given the limited levels of seasonal storage that has been caused by the closure of Rough,” said Energy Aspects analyst Trevor Sikorski. Centrica decided last year to close the more than 30 year old Rough site, which at its operational peak could hold around 10 percent of the country’s gas demand. “With storage quite low and domestic supplies, including the lack of Rough, lower (Dutch gas output from Groningen) and low liquefied natural gas imports, there is a lack of flexibility across the whole of Western Europe,” a gas trader said. British gas imports from the Netherlands have plummeted as production at the Groningen field has been cut to try to reduce earthquakes in the region. Dutch imports fell more than 50 percent last year, data from Britain’s department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, published this week showed. “Only a sharp increase in LNG imports could provide some bearish pressure (on prices) as Groningen production is likely to be further reduced in coming months,” a second gas trader said.

2018-02-23,"WASHINGTON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Two Democratic U.S. senators on Friday urged Attorney General Jeff Sessions to thoroughly investigate Daimler AG after a media report alleged the automaker used potentially illegal software to pass diesel emissions tests, according to a letter seen by Reuters. German newspaper Bild am Sonntag had reported on Sunday that U.S. investigators probing the Mercedes-Benz parent found that its cars were equipped with software which may have helped them to pass diesel emissions tests, citing confidential documents. The report cited emails from Daimler engineers questioning whether these software functions were legal. Senators Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal said recent reports “raise serious questions as to whether Daimler AG deceived federal regulators and U.S. consumers and endangered public health.” They added prosecutors should take “appropriate action against the company, including criminal charges against company executives if warranted.” A Daimler spokesman declined to comment Friday but the company said earlier this week it was cooperating fully with U.S. authorities. Diesel vehicles have been under heightened scrutiny since Daimler rival Volkswagen was forced to pay billions of dollars in fines after admitting in 2015 to using software to evade exhaust tests by manipulating emissions to disguise excess pollution. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in February 2016 requested information from Mercedes-Benz to explain diesel emissions levels. Daimler said in April 2016 the Justice Department had asked it to investigate its emissions certification process. A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately comment. Daimler has said in financial filings it faced ongoing investigations by U.S. and German authorities into excess diesel emissions that could lead to significant penalties and recalls. Software-based engine management systems are illegal if they are not declared to U.S. regulators and if designed to evade anti-pollution tests. In Europe, carmakers have legally made use of a “thermal window,” a temperature threshold allowing carmakers to throttle back emissions management systems to protect the engine from damage. The Justice Department sued Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV in May accusing it of illegally using software that led to excess emissions in 104,000 U.S. diesel vehicles sold since 2014. The government is seeking “substantial” civil penalties to settle the suit. German prosecutors searched Daimler premises in May 2017 as part of an ongoing fraud probe related to false advertising and possible manipulation of exhaust-gas after-treatment in diesel cars. Stuttgart prosecutors said on Monday two Daimler employees were being investigated as part of the probe. In May, Daimler said it had dropped plans to seek U.S. approval to sell 2017 Mercedes-Benz U.S. diesel vehicles. The company faces ongoing U.S. lawsuits from investors.

2018-02-23,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, will generally shun investments in energy sources such as coal that are unlikely to be needed in a future low-carbon society, it said on Friday. In 2016, the Norwegian parliament mandated the fund, which invests Norway’s revenues from oil and gas production in stocks, bonds and real estate abroad, to sell out of firms that derive more than 30 percent of their activities or revenues from coal.  “This divestment from coal means that the fund does not generally invest in an energy source that will probably not survive the transition to a low-carbon society,” the fund said in a letter to the Norwegian Ministry of Finance dated Feb. 21. The letter, signed by fund CEO Yngve Slyngstad and Chief Corporate Governance Officer Carine Smith Ihenacho, was published on the fund’s website on Friday. “The fund’s exposure to climate risk therefore differs from that of a general, market-weighted portfolio,” it added. The fund proposed in November that it should remove oil and gas stocks from its equity benchmark index, which would mean cutting investments in those companies over time. At the time, the news sent the value of oil and gas firm worldwide lower.   The proposal is under review at the finance ministry and will be voted on by the Norwegian parliament at a later stage.

2018-02-23,"(Adds details, quotes, market reaction, byline) By Leah Schnurr OTTAWA, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Canada’s annual inflation rate cooled in January from a year earlier as consumers paid less for gasoline and vehicles, but firmer underlying prices were seen keeping the central bank on track to raise interest rates again later this year. The annual inflation rate was 1.7 percent last month, Statistics Canada said on Friday, down from 1.9 percent in December but above economists’ forecasts for 1.4 percent. The Canadian dollar rallied against the greenback following the better-than-expected figures. The Bank of Canada’s three measures of core inflation were also less muted, with CPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy’s underperformance, rising to 1.8 percent, the highest since April 2012. Taken together, the core measures averaged 1.8 percent. Economists said that should keep the Bank of Canada on a tightening path, though it has room to wait amid several uncertainties, including North American trade negotiations. “There’s still not a lot of evidence that inflation pressures are really getting out of hand in a way that would force the bank to hike more quickly than they’ve been planning to,” said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada. “At the same time, you are seeing the firming that’s been expected, so that means the economy is probably still strong enough, in their view, to withstand further gradual rate hikes.” The bank has raised rates three times since July amid a strengthening economy and labor market, and has said it will be data-dependent in its approach from here. Markets expect the bank to make no change at its next policymaking meeting in March but another rate hike is fully priced in by July. Transportation costs rose 3.2 percent from a year ago, moderating from the previous month’s pace as price gains for gasoline and autos decelerated. But food prices were up 2.3 percent, the largest gain since April 2016, as Canadians paid more for food at restaurants as well as fresh fruits and vegetables. Rounding out the three measures of core inflation, CPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, held at 1.9 percent, while CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, was unchanged at 1.8 percent. Prices in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, rose 1.8 percent, as consumers paid more at restaurants and for childcare and housekeeping services after the province raised its minimum wage at the start of 2018.

2018-02-23,"ATHENS, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Cyprus accused Turkey on Friday of threatening to use force against a drillship chartered by Italy’s Eni, in a standoff over hydrocarbons rights in the eastern Mediterranean. There was no immediate reaction from Turkey, which has vowed to prevent Greek Cypriots from exploring for oil or gas around the ethnically-split island and says some areas of Cyprus’s offshore maritime zone fall under its jurisdiction. On Feb. 9, the Turkish navy on manoeuvres in the Mediterranean stopped the Saipem 12000 vessel on its way to drill for gas in the waters off Cyprus, triggering a diplomatic standoff which has underscored tensions in the region over competing claims for offshore resources. Deputy government spokesman Victoras Papadopoulos told the Cyprus News Agency on Friday the ship was heading to the same area, when five Turkish vessels interrupted its course. “The drillship was halted by five Turkish warships and after threats of violence launched (by the Turkish side) and the threat of a collision with the drillship ... the drillship was compelled to return back,” he said. Turkey, which does not have diplomatic relations with Cyprus, this week extended military exercises in the eastern Mediterranean to March 10. The Saipem 12000 vessel is currently on its way to Limassol where it is expected to stay for a few days, the agency said. Eni said on Thursday it was likely the ship would have to be moved in the coming days, probably to Morocco. Cyprus will officially protest to international forums over the latest incident, Papadopooulos said. Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades was expected to discuss the issue with European Union leaders who are meeting in Brussels on Friday. He said this week that Cyprus was determined to press ahead with its plans for oil and gas exploration. Eni and France’s Total discovered this month a promising natural gas field off Cyprus, which they said looked geologically similar to the mammoth Zohr field off Egypt. Cyprus was split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup. Peace talks collapsed last year. Greek Cypriots, who are exploring for natural gas, run Cyprus’s internationally recognised government. Turkish Cypriots run a breakaway state in north Cyprus recognised only by Ankara.

2018-02-23,"(Adds quotes, news conference details) By Nidhi Verma NEW DELHI, Feb 23 (Reuters) - India is seeking a reasonable price for crude oil from Saudi Arabia, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Friday, in a move that could help Riyadh regain top spot in supplying the world’s third largest oil consumer. “Some instrument can be developed so that the pricing is suitable for both of us,” Pradhan said after a meeting with Saudi Arabian counterpart Khalid al-Falih. “We must get a reasonable price for crude oil and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas),” he said. Iraq surpassed Saudi Arabia in 2017 as the top supplier to India. Asia has become the biggest and most important buyer of crude oil from Saudi Aramco and the oil company wants to secure Asian markets for the long term as it faces competition from suppliers such as Russia and the United States. In a bid to woo Saudi Arabian investment, India has offered Saudi Arabia a stake in the second phase of the country’s strategic oil reserves storage facility, Pradhan said. India is building a six million tonne strategic oil reserve. It already has a 5 million tonne strategic reserved stored at three locations. “The way we have done an arrangement with ADNOC (Abu Dhabi National Oil Company) for storage facility, the same way we are discussing with Aramco (Saudi Aramco),” Pradhan said. India and Saudi Arabia also discussed investment opportunities in a proposed oil refinery on the west coast of India with a capacity of 1.2 million barrels per day and a petrochemicals project in the southern city of Kakinada, Pradhan said. “They are more than interested, we are discussing the nitty gritty of the projects “ he said. Saudi Aramco, world’s biggest oil producer, is investing in refineries abroad to help lock in demand for its crude and expand its market share ahead of its planned initial public offering. Last year Saudi Arabia pledged billions of dollars of investment in projects in Indonesia and Malaysia as part of long-term oil supply deals.

2018-02-23,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Ernest Scheyder HOUSTON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - U.S. oil production has topped 10 million barrels per day, approaching a record set in 1970, but many investors in the companies driving the shale oil revolution are still waiting for their payday. Shale producers have raised and spent billions of dollars to produce more oil and gas, ending decades of declining output and redrawing the global energy trade map. But most U.S. shale producers have failed for years to turn a profit with the increased output, frustrating their financial backers. Wall Street’s patience ran out late last year as investors called for producers to shift more cash to dividends and share buybacks. “‘Give me some cash, please.’ That’s what investors have said,” said Anoop Poddar, a partner at private equity firm Energy Ventures. And yet such calls for payouts remain a debate in the industry as oil prices have recently creeped up to four-year highs. Investors demanding immediate returns could risk forcing firms to curb expansion that could have a higher long-term payoff if oil prices continue to rise. (For an interactive graphic charting the global impacts of the U.S. shale oil boom, see: tmsnrt.rs/2EtJgen ) For now, share prices of shale producers have yet to fully recover from the 2014 oil price collapse, when many investors took losses as hundreds of firms went bankrupt and those that survived struggled. The energy sector has lagged the rally that took the broader stock market to record highs. The S&P 500 Energy Index remains nearly a third off its peak in mid-2014, when oil prices topped $100 a barrel. The broader S&P 500 index is up 39 percent during the same period. A Reuters analysis of corporate dividend disclosures shows a split in how shale firms are reacting to increased pressure from investors - and the impact on their market value. This year, five of the 15 largest U.S. independent shale firms have started paying or raised quarterly dividends, the documents show. But six of the firms have never offered a dividend or have not restored cuts implemented since the 2014 oil price collapse. Anadarko Petroleum Corp earlier this month added $500 million to an existing buyback program and raised its dividend by 20 percent, sending its shares up 4.5 percent the next trading day. Buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding, boosting the value of stock that remains. Shares in Pioneer Natural Resources Co also rose 4 percent immediately after raising its dividend four-fold and posting better-than-forecast fourth quarter results earlier this month. Tim Dove, Pioneer’s chief executive, called the increase “a step toward our goal of returning cash to shareholders.” Companies that have resisted boosting dividends, by contrast, have seen their valuations fall. Of the six, shares in four - Cimarex Energy Co, Devon Energy Corp, Parsley Energy Inc and Noble Energy Inc - have lost at least 19 percent in the last 12 months. Only one, Continental Resources Inc, is higher than a year ago. Four producers, including Hess Corp, kept dividends steady through the downturn. A PASS FOR SMALL, HIGH-GROWTH FIRMS Recent oil price gains have eased the pressure from shareholders. In January, U.S. oil futures jumped to $66.14 a barrel, up 56 percent from last year’s low and at a level not seen in four years. Since then, prices have cooled to about $63 a barrel, but remain 17 percent above a year ago, boosting cash flow for firms that have expanded output. “A lot of these smaller companies have gotten a pass for outspending cash flow due to their very high growth rates,” said Todd Heltman of asset manager Neuberger Berman, which invests in shale producers. Shale output growth continues to outpace forecasts. The U.S. Energy Information Administration this month said United States production could top 11 million barrels per day by the end of 2018, a year earlier than it had expected just a month ago. Heltman has pressed shale firms to show restraint even amid rising prices. And despite higher revenues, spending increases have so far been restrained. Producers have pushed up spending plans for all of 2018 by 10 percent over last year, according to a tally of 41 of the 65 producers tracked by financial services firm Cowen & Co. Some companies have maintained conservative assumptions for the average oil price for 2018, budgeting for prices between $50 and $55 a barrel. A higher price will mean they can cover new drilling investments and still pay dividends. Investors are searching for firms that can find the optimal balance between the conflicting goals of controlling costs, paying dividends and increasing production. “We’re looking to invest in those companies who have been able to improve their production and win the battle as far as cost of extraction,” said Derek Rollingson, portfolio manager of the ICON Energy Fund, which holds shares of more than a dozen U.S. shale producers. A further rise in oil prices, however, could lead investors to take on more risk and penalize more conservative companies, said Mike Breard, an energy analyst at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas. “If oil is $65 by Easter,” he said, “investors are going to go to the companies and say, ‘Why don’t you borrow more money and drill more wells?’” Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Additional reporting by Liz

2018-02-23,"(Repeats Thursday story with no changes to text) By David Alire Garcia MEXICO CITY, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Mexico’s presidential frontrunner is not opposed to foreign investment in the country’s oil, his top energy adviser said, but his government would make dramatic changes to energy strategy, including a new focus on refining rather than crude exports. In perhaps the most significant change envisioned by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the favorite to win the July 1 election, Mexico would seek to end decades of exporting crude in three years, a lawmaker who Lopez Obrador has tapped to be his future energy minister said in an interview. Instead, Mexico should turn its focus to value-added fuels, processing crude domestically to produce more gasoline and diesel at refineries owned by state oil company Pemex, Rocio Nahle told Reuters late on Wednesday. “In a three-year period, at the latest, we need to try to consume our own fuels and not depend on foreign gasoline,” said Nahle at her congressional office in Mexico City. That could spell bad news for U.S. refiners. Mexico is their biggest foreign market currently, with purchases of gasoline and diesel growing rapidly in recent years to an average of 808,000 barrels per day (bpd) last year, or about two-thirds of total domestic demand, according to Pemex data. Pemex’s total crude exports, mostly to U.S. Gulf Coast refiners as well as Asian and European buyers, averaged 1.17 million bpd in 2017, down from a peak of 1.87 million bpd in 2004. But Latin American countries are increasingly seeking to add value to their exports of raw commodities. Nahle gave details of what that might mean for Mexico - modernizing Pemex’s six existing refineries, and building one or two new ones that would add crude processing capacities of between 300,000 and 600,000 bpd. Possible sites in the oil-producing states of Tabasco and Campeche had been identified and the new facilities would be financed by either public funds or some kind of public-private partnership, she said. “We are doing the technical, economic analysis to see if it (would be) one big refinery, or two medium-sized ones,” said Nahle, a petrochemical engineer who represents the Gulf coast state of Veracruz, also a major oil producer, in Congress. A Lopez Obrador government would aim to improve the existing refineries’ productivity in about eight months solely using public funds, Nahle said. Pemex refineries currently have the capacity to process about 1.6 million bpd, though last year they only refined about 770,000 bpd. The company produces about 1.9 million bpd of crude, down from a 2004 peak of 3.4 million bpd. Leftist Lopez Obrador holds a double-digit lead over his nearest rival in many opinion polls, although a young center-right contender has been gaining ground. Nahle, who leads Lopez Obrador’s Morena party in the lower house of Congress, said, if elected, their government would closely examine all the deals made under President Enrique Pena Nieto’s 2013-2014 oil opening, but welcomed private investment. “We in Morena are open to investment, we are open to the world,” Nahle said. Lopez Obrador initially opposed the oil reform, which ended Pemex’s decades-old monopoly, but seems to have softened his stance since the changes have begun to be implemented. To date, some 90 exploration and production contracts have been awarded to a wide range of oil companies over eight auctions, including nine deepwater blocks won by Royal Dutch Shell at a tender last month. The government forecasts that the companies would invest around $150 billion if the projects are commercially successfully over the lifetime of the contracts. In recent months, Lopez Obrador has said that he would review the contracts to make sure there was no corruption involved. Nahle said his team had already looked at publicly available contracts without finding problems, but would study files that are not in the public sphere in detail if they win the election. If a Lopez Obrador government were to determine that already-signed contracts were flawed or tainted by corruption, it would likely not authorize future oil auctions, Nahle said. “It would be very rash for me to tell you now that we are going to hand over more blocks, no? Or to say we are never going to do more blocks,” said Nahle. “We will see at every moment what is best for Mexico,” she said, adding that the current government had been “irresponsible” by auctioning off too many oil and gas blocks. “Nowhere in the world have we seen handed over (to private oil companies) such a stream of blocks ... it seems like an excessive rush,” she said. Other Lopez Obrador advisers have said in recent days that the team was happy with the contracts signed under the outgoing government. While she said Lopez Obrador was open to authorizing more equity joint ventures with Pemex, also allowed by the energy opening, Nahle stressed the need for Pemex to seek partnerships outside Mexico. “Pemex needs to go to Asia, Pemex needs to go to Texas, Pemex needs to go to South America to find partners ... it’s a priority for us that Pemex is truly globalized,” she said.

2018-02-23,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has called a meeting early next week with key senators and Cabinet officials to discuss potential changes to biofuels policy, which is coming under increasing pressure after a Pennsylvania refiner blamed the regulation for its bankruptcy, according to four sources familiar with the matter. The meeting comes as the oil industry and corn lobby – powerful forces in Washington – clash over the future of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a decade-old regulation that requires refiners to cover the cost of mixing biofuels such as corn-based ethanol into their fuel. Trump’s engagement reflects the high political stakes of protecting jobs in a key electoral state. Oil refiner Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES), which employs more than a thousand people in Philadelphia, declared bankruptcy last month and blamed the regulation for its demise. The meeting, scheduled for Tuesday, will include Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa, along with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, and potentially Energy Secretary Rick Perry, according to the four sources, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. One source said the meeting would focus on short-term solutions to help PES continue operating. PES is asking a bankruptcy judge to shed roughly $350 million of its current RFS compliance costs, owed to the EPA which administers the program, as part of its restructuring package. The other sources said the meeting will consider whether to cap prices for biofuel credits, let higher-ethanol blends be sold all year, and efforts to get speculators out of the market. Officials at the EPA, Agriculture Department, and Energy Department declined to comment. A White House official, Kelly Love, said she had no announcement on the matter at this time. The offices of Cruz, Ernst and Grassley did not immediately return requests for comment.  The sources said the options moving forward would be constrained by political and legal realities that have derailed previous efforts at reform. The Trump administration has already considered changes to the RFS sought by refiners this year - including reducing the amount of biofuels required to be blended annually under the regulation, or shifting the responsibility for blending to supply terminals - only to retreat in the face of opposition from corn-state lawmakers. The EPA is expected to weigh in officially in the coming weeks on PES’s request to the bankruptcy judge to be released from its compliance obligations. But any such move would likely draw a backlash from other U.S. refiners, who have no hope of receiving a waiver. Under the RFS, refiners must earn or purchase blending credits called RINs to prove they are complying with the regulation. As biofuels volumes quotas have increased, so have prices for the credits - meaning refiners that invested in blending facilities have benefited while those that have not, such as PES, have had to pay up. PES said its RFS compliance costs exceeded its payroll last year, and ranked only behind the cost of purchasing crude oil. Other issues may have contributed to PES’s financial difficulties. Reuters reported that PES’s investor backers withdrew from the company more than $594 million in a series of dividend-style distributions since 2012, even as regional refining economics slumped. Regulators and lawmakers have been considering how to cut the cost of the RFS to the oil industry. In recent months, for example, the EPA has contemplated expanding its use of an exemption available to small refineries - a move that would likely push down RIN prices, but which both the oil and corn industries have said would be unfair.  Cruz last year proposed limiting the price of RINs to 10 cents, a fraction of their current value – an idea that was roundly rejected by the ethanol industry as a disincentive for new ethanol blending infrastructure investment.     Senator John Cornyn, also a Texas Republican, is preparing draft legislation to overhaul the RFS in Congress that would include the creation of a new specialized RIN credit intended to push down prices - but it too faces resistance from both the corn and oil lobbies.

2018-02-23,"* Euro stocks flat, MSCI world sees 3rd weekly fall in last 4 * Dollar higher vs majors, DXY up 1 percent for the week * Seventh weekly rise in U.S. yields in last eight * Gold heading for biggest weekly drop since December * Russia waits on S&P investment grade rating decision By Marc Jones LONDON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - A stronger dollar and slightly higher global borrowing costs kept world shares subdued on Friday and left gold limping toward its worst week since December. Europe’s main London, Frankfurt and Paris markets barely budged in early moves, keeping MSCI’s 47- country world index just in the black on the day but facing its third red week of the last four. Wall Street futures were pointing slightly higher, but the there too the S&P 500 and Dow Jones are both down around 1 percent for the week. Modest gains for the dollar meant the euro was set to post its second biggest weekly loss in nearly four months . Caution over the Italian election also gave bonds there their toughest week of 2018. Polls point to a hung parliament in Italy, where no one party or coalition has an outright majority to form a government, and analysts expect short-term volatility that could weigh on traditionally sensitive euro zone markets. Italy’s 10-year bond yield was up 1 bps at 2.09 percent . It has risen about 10 basis points this week. “Some long-forgotten patterns return to euro bond markets with Bunds rallying while Italy sells off,” said Commerzbank rates strategist Christoph Rieger. He noted comments from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker this week, who was reported to have warned about Italian election risks. Broader global cross-asset issues remained much the same as they have during a choppy few weeks. How far and fast U.S. interest rates can rise and what would it mean for global borrowing costs, risk appetite and business confidence. That caution is reverberating in the bond markets with U.S. yields rising by more than 50 basis points since early December, more than the 38 basis points for German government debt. Benchmark Treasury 10-year note yields rose to a four-year high of 2.957 percent on Wednesday though they were a shade below 2.90 percent on Friday. The backsliding also trimmed the dollar’s overnight gains in Asia. It was treading water against most major currencies ahead of U.S. trading, buying 106.8 yen and at $1.2306 and $1.3965 against the euro and pound. It was still up more than 1 percent for the week though and headed for its third gain in the last four weeks. “We think the Fed could well put U.S. (interest) rates up four times this year but even then it only takes U.S. rates to 2.5 by the end of the year,” said JPMorgan Asset Management global strategist Mike Bell. “So the question is would they continue at that pace in 2019?” One of the Fed’s chief doves, St Louis Fed President James Bullard, tried to tamp down those expectations of four rate hikes this year on Thursday, saying policymakers needed to be careful not to slow the economy. Russian markets were readying for a big day with S&P Global due to review Moscow’s credit rating. It is just one step away from returning Russia to the investment grade bracket that it ejected it from after the 2014-2015 slump in oil prices and the Ukraine crisis. Its resurrection would also see Russian foreign currency bonds return to some widely-tracked bond indices. In Asian trading overnight, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.9 percent on Friday to add to the previous week’s 3.9 percent gain. It is still down more than 4 percent in February so far, however, after global equity markets were mauled at the start of the month by worries that inflation was picking up. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.7 percent, though China’s SSE Composite index and the blue-chip CSI300 both pared early gains after the government seized control of acquisitive financial conglomerate Anbang Insurance. It was seen as a dramatic move that underscores Beijing’s intent to crackdown on financial risk. There were equally significant signs emerging from China’s central bank. Liu He, a Harvard-trained economist who is a trusted confidant of Chinese President Xi Jinping, has emerged as frontrunner to be the next governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), sources told Reuters. Liu would replace current PBOC chief, 70-year-old Zhou Xiaochuan, who is China’s longest-running head of the central bank, having taken the job in 2002. Zhou is expected to retire around the time of the annual session of parliament in March. Chinese currency, the yuan, notched marginal losses in the what has been a holiday-shortened week. The dollar’s strength meant it remained a tough environment for commodities which are priced in the U.S. currency. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $62.74 a barrel, down 3 cents from their last settlement, while Brent crude futures were down 2 cents at $66.37 a barrel. There were concerns about high U.S. crude export levels which outweighed an unexpected drop in oil inventories in the country which is also the world’s biggest fuel consumer. Industrial metals such as copper eased as they headed for a small weekly drop and as trading slowly picked up again after Chinese markets had been shut following the Lunar New Year holiday. Gold remained the stand-out mover though and looking increasingly less precious. Its spot market price was down 0.2 percent at $1,328, heading for a fifth session of falls in six. It has shed 1.6 percent this week, its biggest drop since early December. “We remain somewhat cautious on gold over the short term given that we think the dollar rally is still not over, especially in the light of U.S. Treasury yields remaining elevated,” said INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir.

2018-02-23,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A South African minister inadvertently misled parliament when she said a local consultancy firm linked to business friends of former President Jacob Zuma had no contracts with state power utility Eskom, an anti-graft watchdog said on Thursday. This is the latest criticism of a senior government official and comes as new President Cyril Ramaphosa is considering a cabinet reshuffle after replacing Zuma, whose rule was marred by a series of scandals. Busisiwe Mkhwebane, head of the Public Protectors office, said in her report that Ramaphosa should take action within 14 days against the Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown, whose department oversees enterprises including Eskom.  “Minister Brown inadvertently misled Parliament in her assertion that there were no other contracts of engagement concluded between Eskom and Trillian,” said Mkhwebane in her report, adding that she breached a ministerial code of ethics. In response, Brown blamed the utility for giving her misleading information she read out in parliament in December 2016. She said the information was signed off by Anoj Singh, former Eskom chief financial officer on behalf of the utility’s CEO. Brown said Singh had told her that no payments were made to Trillian, a consultancy linked to the Gupta family. Brown said when she became aware that she had been misled, she ordered Eskom’s board to take disciplinary action against “those who conspired to mislead me, Parliament and the country.” Khulu Phasiwe, Eskom’s spokesman, said Singh and others were suspended by the board after Brown’s instruction. Singh was suspended by Eskom in July 2017 and formally resigned his post in January. Singh did not answer a call made to his cell phone. Tyrone Seale, Ramaphosa’s acting spokesman, said the presidency was still studying the Public Protector’s report. Zuma’s business associates include three brothers from the Gupta family who have been accused of using their political connections to win contracts at state firms, including Eskom, and influence cabinet appointments.  Zuma and the Gupta brothers deny wrongdoing. Earlier this week, South Africa’s parliament said it would launch an investigation into allegations of influence-peddling against mines minister Mosebenzi Zwane. Zwane has denied any wrongdoing. Separately, a South African court found Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba violated the constitution over a decision he made while home affairs minister. Gigaba has said he would challenge the ruling.

2018-02-23,"PARIS (Reuters) - French nuclear regulator ASN said it has told EDF to improve the running of the construction of the Flamanville nuclear reactor, which is years behind schedule and billions over budget. The ASN has repeatedly said a schedule to load nuclear fuel at the EPR reactor in Flamanville, which is the same type as EDF is building in Britain’s Hinkley Point, by year-end is tight. ASN said EDF (EDF.PA) must improve the follow-up of pre-startup test as well as the treatment of any flaws, and to improve the information flow to the regulator. “EDF has promised to put in place an action plan to remedy these dysfunctions,” ASN said in a statement on Friday. The ASN also said it had questioned EDF and Framatome, the company formerly called Areva, about flaws in the welding of the Flamanville reactor’s steam pipes. EDF said on Thursday some weldings on the reactor did not meet specifications but said this would not affect safety or the schedule to load fuel. ASN said it had asked EDF to send it a complete study about the discovery and impact of the weldings problem and that it would consult experts about it in the second half of 2018.  In June, the ASN ruled that the reactor vessel’s cover was fit for service despite weak spots in its steel, but would have to be replaced by 2024.  Any further delay to Flamanville would be another blow to the image of the EPR reactor. Three others have been under construction for years in Finland and China and are all over budget and schedule.  It could also force EDF to increase its cost estimate for the reactor, which it last updated to 10.5 billion euros in September 2015, from an original estimate of 3 billion euros.

2018-02-23,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese engineering researchers say they have created a tiny electronic light the size of a firefly which rides waves of ultrasound, and could eventually figure in applications ranging from moving displays to projection mapping.  Named Luciola for its resemblance to the firefly, the featherweight levitating particle weighs 16.2 mg, has a diameter of 3.5 mm (0.14 inch), and emits a red glimmer that can just about illuminate text.  But its minuscule size belies the power of the 285 microspeakers emitting ultrasonic waves that hold up the light, and have a frequency inaudible to the human ear, allowing  Luciola to operate in apparent total silence.  It took two years for Luciola to get this far, said circuit design specialist Makoto Takamiya, a member of the Kawahara Universal Information Network Project that developed the device.  “Ultimately, my hope is that such tiny objects will have smartphone capabilities and be built to float about helping us in our everyday lives in smarter ways,” said the University of Tokyo professor, who hopes it will be commercially viable in five to 10 years. The developers expect Luciola to find applications in the so-called Internet of Things, in which regular objects, such as cars, or domestic appliances such as air-conditioners, are connected to networks to send and receive data. Equipped with movement or temperature sensors, Luciola could fly to such objects to deliver a message or help to make moving displays with multiple lights that can detect the presence of humans, or participate in futuristic projection mapping events. The Kawahara Universal Information Network Project is a government-funded program that is part of the Japan Science and Technology Agency and explores advances in information and communication technology.

The industrial conglomerate, which has been conducting a strategic review of its businesses, said it had begun the process for an initial public offering (IPO) of the Indian unit, Sembcorp Energy India Ltd. It expected the divestments of peripheral utilities assets to provide cash proceeds of up to S$500 million ($380 million) over the next two years, not including the potential proceeds from the proposed India listing on BSE Ltd and the National Stock Exchange of India. “I think they are making the right move. They will definitely be able to unlock cash from their divestment of assets and the IPO,” said Joel Ng, an analyst with KGI Securities. A draft prospectus showed the IPO comprises of a fresh issue of shares worth up to 40.95 billion rupees ($631 million) by Sembcorp Energy India, and up to 146.8 million shares will be offered for sale by existing shareholders. The company, the biggest shareholder in rig-builder Sembcorp Marine, reported a net profit of S$22.8 million for the fourth quarter, a drop of 85 percent from the same period a year ago. Shares of Sembcorp Marine fell as much as 6.9 percent on Friday, extending Thursday’s 11 percent slump - their biggest two-day percentage fall in a decade. The company had turned in poorer-than-expected results earlier this week. Sembcorp Industries’ review, which began last year, had prompted market talk of a potential privatisation or divestment of Sembcorp Marine, according to analysts. The market was likely disappointed that its parent’s review did not include any action related to Sembcorp Marine, KGI’s Ng said. Neil McGregor, Sembcorp Industries’ CEO, said the company was confident that Sembcorp Marine was well-positioned to benefit from offshore and marine industry’s recovery, said. “We will continue to support the business through the cycle,” he said. The company said its utilities business will now focus on four key markets, Singapore and Southeast Asia, China, India and the UK. Sembcorp Industries, which set a target of doubling its renewables portfolio to about 4,000 megawatts by 2022, also said it had entered into a conditional agreement to divest its municipal water operations in South Africa. Its CEO said the company hopes to increase its return on equity to double-digit levels in five years, from 3.2 percent currently. Singapore state investor Temasek is the biggest shareholder in Sembcorp Industries. Axis Capital, Credit Suisse, CLSA and SBI Capital Markets are the global coordinators for the India IPO.

Ex-Soviet Turkmenistan holds the world’s fourth-largest natural gas reserves but has been heavily dependent on gas exports to China after Russia cut back gas imports in the past few years. The project is expected to transport 33 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas a year along an 1,800 kilometre (1,125 miles) route from Galkynysh, the world’s second-biggest gas field, to Fazilka near the border with Pakistan in northern India. “South Asia is being connected with Central Asia through Afghanistan after more than a century of division,” Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said. He was speaking at a ceremony attended by Turkmen President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and India’s Minister of State for External Affairs M.J. Akbar. While the pipeline will allow Turkmenistan to find new consumers in Asia and cut its dependence on Beijing, which buys about 35 billion cubic metres of gas annually. It is also being seen as a central plank in ambitious regional development goals. “TAPI will lead from a gas pipeline into an energy and communication corridor,” Abbasi said, adding that as well as providing energy, the pipeline would underpin development of road, rail and communications networks. The TAPI project, supported by the United States and the Asian Development Bank, has been touted by Turkmenistan since the 1990s. But the start of work was delayed because of the problem of crossing Afghanistan. The pipeline will run for hundreds of kilometres (miles) through areas of southern Afghanistan largely controlled by Taliban insurgents fighting the Western-backed government in Kabul but the movement has signalled that it will not hinder the project. The Taliban issued a statement on Friday, pledging its cooperation with TAPI, which it said would be an important element in building up Afghanistan’s economic infrastructure. “There will be no delay in this important national project,” it said in a statement, which blamed the government in Kabul for delays in starting construction. Ghani, striving to build up Afghanistan’s war-shattered economy, has pushed the development of regional transport and energy networks to underpin long-term development and turn Afghanistan into a regional hub instead of a source of instability. Afghanistan, which suffers from chronic energy shortages, is expected to take 5 billion cubic metres of gas itself, with the rest divided equally between Pakistan and India. In addition, Kabul will earn hundreds of millions of dollars in transit fees.

2018-02-23,"ULAANBAATAR (Reuters) - Smog in the Mongolia’s capital, Ulaanbaatar, is causing a public health crisis, especially among children, with treatment costs likely to put the cash-strapped country under increasing strain, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said.    The government needed to take urgent action to limit smog-induced health problems, UNICEF and Mongolia’s National Center for Public Health said in a study, adding that a failure to act could push treatment costs up by a third by 2025, amounting to a further 4.8 billion tugrik ($2 million) a year in the capital. “Air pollution has become a child health crisis in Ulaanbaatar, putting every child and pregnancy at risk,” UNICEF Mongolia Representative Alex Heikens said in a release. “The risks include stillbirth, preterm birth, lower birth weight, pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma, inhibited brain development and death,” he said. Pollution levels in Ulaanbaatar had become worse than that in cities such as Beijing and New Delhi, UNICEF and the public health agency said in their report, released on Thursday. Concentrations of breathable airborne particles known as PM2.5 were as high as 3,320 micrograms per cubic meter at one monitoring station on Jan. 30, they said. Average PM2.5 readings for January stood at about 206 micrograms in Ulaanbaatar, according to Reuters calculations based on incomplete government data.     The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends annual average PM2.5 concentrations of no more than 10 micrograms. PM2.5 in Beijing stood at 34 micrograms in January, down 70.7 percent from a year earlier. Mongolia has struggled with pollution in its capital, where an influx of out-of-work herders migrating from the countryside has seen the population double in less than two decades. The government has offered subsidies for more-efficient wood- and coal-burning stoves and it is also providing free electricity at night in some districts. But smog levels spike in the bitterly cold winters, especially in poor “ger” neighborhoods, named after the felt tents in which many migrants live. Many ger households burn coal or even trash to keep warm and the smog they produce has led to a surge in respiratory and heart disease and stoked anger and protests. “Reducing air pollution levels is the only long-term sustainable solution to protecting children’s health,” Heikens said. “In the meantime, thousands of children will continue to suffer unless urgent action is taken.” Reporting by Terrence Edwards; Editing by David Stanway, Robert Birsel",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mongolia-pollution/mongolian-air-pollution-causing-health-crisis-unicef-idUKL4N1QD2YL,23 Feb 2018,"Smog in the Mongolia's

2018-02-23,"LOKICHAR, Kenya (Reuters) - In the decades before oil was discovered in the northern Kenyan region of Turkana South, 100,000 poor villagers living in arid scrubland relied on a lone church-run health centre in Lokichar town for medical help. Since Tullow Oil found crude there six years ago, the London-listed company has funded a 40-bed referral hospital, school classrooms and dormitories, provided village water points graded roads, and paid for scholarships to generate goodwill. Seeing the potential benefits of oil, residents of the poorest of Kenya’s 47 counties now want the central government to make up for decades of neglect by ploughing nearly a third of expected oil revenues back into Turkana. The central government has other ideas. Parliament passed a draft bill in 2016 allocating 20 percent of any state oil revenue to local government and 10 percent to communities living where the crude was discovered, leaving 70 percent for the central government in Nairobi. But President Uhuru Kenyatta never signed the bill. A revised version due to be debated in parliament this month cuts the regional government share to 15 percent, with only 5 percent for local communities. The legislation must be passed before large-scale oil production can begin. Kenyatta’s Jubilee Party, which controls 213 of parliament’s 349 seats, is likely to back the revised law, but some of its lawmakers may break ranks and side with the opposition pushing for more money for local communities. “Now that they have suffered for so long, the revenue from oil must actually feed them, treat them and take their children to school,” said Jubilee Party member James Lomenen, member of parliament for Turkana South. Lomenen plans to table an amendment to the Petroleum Exploration, Development and Production Bill to restore the 10 percent share to local communities. Residents see the new terms as another slap in the face for Turkana, a vast scrubland the size of Sri Lanka where most residents live in villages without power or running water. Joseph Nachar, a village elder in Loktorio, which is close to one of Tullow’s wells, said locals will oppose oil companies if they don’t get their 10 percent. He vowed to vote against any representative who doesn’t fight for their cut. In 2013, demonstrators backed by local politicians marched on drilling sites demanding jobs and other benefits, forcing Tullow to halt work for two weeks. “We are the owners of the land where they are getting oil,” said Nachar. Local leaders say the money will help make up for years of neglect in areas such as health and education. Turkana’s literacy rate is just 20 percent, while the national average is more than 70 percent. The maternal mortality rate in Kenya was 382 for every 100,000 live births in 2014, but in Turkana it was above 1,000, the U.N. children’s fund (UNICEF) said. “We are starting from scratch,” said Jane Ajele, Turkana county’s executive committee member for health. Nairobi officials argue that Turkana’s economy, which largely depends on livestock, cannot absorb a wave of cash. “We want them to prosper but if we see a pitfall somewhere, we have to advise people,” said Andrew Kamau, principal secretary in the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum. Most of Kenya’s oil blocks have not been explored. Those owned by Tullow and its partners, Africa Oil Corp and Total SA, hold an estimated 750 million barrels. While that’s less than African frontier oil countries such as Uganda and Ghana, exports scheduled to start in 2021 would earn the government $1.2 billion a year at peak production at current prices, government officials say. That’s about 10 percent of annual revenue, comparable to the country’s biggest export, tea. The petroleum bill would also create a sovereign wealth fund, financed with oil revenues, which the government says it would manage to guard against currency fluctuations and theft.  But Turkana residents have little faith the government, tainted by a series of corruption scandals, will manage their money well. Kenya loses a third of its state budget - the equivalent of about $6 billion - to corruption every year, former anti-graft chief Philip Kinisu told Reuters in 2016. The government denied the figure and Kinisu was fired five months after giving the interview. His successor did not respond to requests for comment.  Auditor General Edward Ouko has also accused the national government of corruption and mismanagement in a series of scathing reports.  He has been equally critical of county authorities, set up in 2013 to help counter complaints about central government theft. About 20 percent of Turkana’s 12 billion shilling ($119 million) budget in 2016 was unaccounted for, Ouko’s office said.  “With the corruption that we have in Kenya, you can only trust what goes to the community directly,” said MP Lomenen. Tullow has already spent 1.5 billion shillings ($15 million) on community projects. But the row over revenue sharing has eaten into the oil companies’ tight timelines. “The clock is ticking,” said Tullow Oil Kenya country manager Martin Mbogo. Technical studies of 40 wells in the Lokichar basin were due to start last year but have been delayed.  So has early oil production, due to start last June. About 2,000 barrels of crude were to be trucked out daily until an 800 km (500 mile) pipeline is built to Indian Ocean ports. Petroleum ministry official Kamau said delegations including community representatives would visit established producers such as Nigeria, Canada and Oman to seek advice on revenue sharing. In Nigeria, 13 percent of oil revenue goes to local communities, though that has not stopped attacks on oil installations by those wanting more. The rest is shared out among the three tiers of the Nigerian government; the federal branch gets 52 percent. Expectations among the Turkana people are similarly high. “They should think about us because we are not getting any help at all,” said Joshua Losepito, standing with his wife and daughter outside their hut made of sticks and branches near Lokichar town.

2018-02-23,"(Updates levels throughout) * MSCI ex-Japan up climbs 0.9 pct, Nikkei up 0.8 pct * Mixed signals elsewhere— E-Mini futures up, FTSE futures down * Market seen in ‘holding pattern’ ahead of key data next week * Yen holds on gains amid heightened market volatility By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Asian shares rebounded on Friday as comments from a Federal Reserve official eased worries about faster rate rises in the United States, while the dollar ticked higher as investors dipped their toes back into riskier assets. Indications were mixed for other global equity markets, with E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 up 0.3 percent but London’s FTSE futures slipping 0.2 percent. Financial markets have fluctuated wildly this month as investors fretted about how fast the Fed might raise rates in the wake of data showing a pick up in U.S. inflation. Even though broader U.S. price pressures still appear modest for now, markets are fully pricing in three rate hikes this year, one more than was seen just a few months ago. Some analysts even expect four. That in turn has stoked anxiety that many central banks will start to tighten policy and raise borrowing costs, hurting corporate earnings and clouding the outlook for what had been expected to be another solid year of global economic gowth. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.9 percent on Friday to add on to the previous week’s 3.9 percent gain. It is still down more than 4 percent in February so far, however, after global equity markets were mauled at the start of the month by worries that inflation is picking up. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.7 percent. China’s SSE Composite index and the blue-chip CSI300 both pared early gains after the government seized control of acquisitive financial conglomerate Anbang Insurance, in a dramatic move that underscores Beijing’s intent to crackdown on financial risk. The gains in Asia followed a sell-off Thursday after minutes of the Fed’s last meeting showed policy makers were confident about the economic outlook. That prompted some investors to boost the chance of faster rate hikes. St Louis Fed President James Bullard tried to tamp down expectations of four rate hikes in 2018, instead of the widely anticipated three, saying on Thursday policymakers need to be careful not to increase rates too quickly because that could slow the economy. The Fed had caused a so called “taper tantrum” in May 2013 when it signalled it was time to stop pumping cash into the U.S. economy, a move that created havoc in financial markets particularly Asia. But analysts are more upbeat about the outlook for the region despite prospects of rising U.S. inflation and rates. “Financial market volatility has not dented our constructive view on Asia’s growth outlook for this year,” said Khoon Goh Singapore-based Head of Research for ANZ. “Higher inflation and a larger fiscal deficit in the United States will likely see U.S. bond yields move higher, but improved fundamentals in Asia mean the region is better placed to weather this than in 2013.” Analysts expect the market to be in a “holding pattern” ahead of a slew of important U.S. January activity data on Tuesday, followed by global surveys on manufacturing activity on Thursday. The dollar was up 0.1 percent at 106.91 yen amid rapidly shifting views in U.S. monetary policy. The yen, which tends to benefit during times of heightened volatility or uncertainty, rose almost 1 percent overnight. The euro dipped to $1.2303 after gaining 0.4 percent the previous day. The common currency has lost more than 0.75 percent so far this week, following its ascent to a three-year top of $1.2556 on Feb. 16. Oil prices eased from two-week highs, as high U.S. crude exports outweighted lower crude inventories in the world’s biggest consumer of the fuel. U.S. crude was off 3 cents at $62.74 per barrel and Brent eased 7 cent to $66.32. Spot gold slipped 0.3 percent to $1328.05 an ounce. Reporting by Swati Pandey; Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Kim

2018-02-23,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil production has topped 10 million barrels per day, approaching a record set in 1970, but many investors in the companies driving the shale oil revolution are still waiting for their payday. Shale producers have raised and spent billions of dollars to produce more oil and gas, ending decades of declining output and redrawing the global energy trade map. But most U.S. shale producers have failed for years to turn a profit with the increased output, frustrating their financial backers. Wall Street’s patience ran out late last year as investors called for producers to shift more cash to dividends and share buybacks. “‘Give me some cash, please.’ That’s what investors have said,” said Anoop Poddar, a partner at private equity firm Energy Ventures. And yet such calls for payouts remain a debate in the industry as oil prices have recently creeped up to four-year highs. Investors demanding immediate returns could risk forcing firms to curb expansion that could have a higher long-term payoff if oil prices continue to rise. (For an interactive graphic charting the global impacts of the U.S. shale oil boom, see: tmsnrt.rs/2EtJgen ) For now, share prices of shale producers have yet to fully recover from the 2014 oil price CLc1 collapse, when many investors took losses as hundreds of firms went bankrupt and those that survived struggled. The energy sector has lagged the rally that took the broader stock market to record highs. The S&P 500 Energy Index .SPNY remains nearly a third off its peak in mid-2014, when oil prices CLc1LCOc1 topped $100 a barrel. The broader S&P 500 index .INX is up 39 percent during the same period. A Reuters analysis of corporate dividend disclosures shows a split in how shale firms are reacting to increased pressure from investors - and the impact on their market value. This year, five of the 15 largest U.S. independent shale firms have started paying or raised quarterly dividends, the documents show. But six of the firms have never offered a dividend or have not restored cuts implemented since the 2014 oil price collapse. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) earlier this month added $500 million to an existing buyback program and raised its dividend by 20 percent, sending its shares up 4.5 percent the next trading day. Buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding, boosting the value of stock that remains.  Shares in Pioneer Natural Resources Co (PXD.N) also rose 4 percent immediately after raising its dividend four-fold and posting better-than-forecast fourth quarter results earlier this month. Tim Dove, Pioneer’s chief executive, called the increase “a step toward our goal of returning cash to shareholders.” Companies that have resisted boosting dividends, by contrast, have seen their valuations fall. Of the six, shares in four - Cimarex Energy Co (XEC.N), Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N), Parsley Energy Inc (PE.N) and Noble Energy Inc (NBL.N) - have lost at least 19 percent in the last 12 months. Only one, Continental Resources Inc (CLR.N), is higher than a year ago.  Four producers, including Hess Corp (HES.N), kept dividends steady through the downturn. A PASS FOR SMALL, HIGH-GROWTH FIRMS Recent oil price gains have eased the pressure from shareholders. In January, U.S. oil futures CLc1 jumped to $66.14 a barrel, up 56 percent from last year’s low and at a level not seen in four years. Since then, prices have cooled to about $63 a barrel, but remain 17 percent above a year ago, boosting cash flow for firms that have expanded output. “A lot of these smaller companies have gotten a pass for outspending cash flow due to their very high growth rates,” said Todd Heltman of asset manager Neuberger Berman, which invests in shale producers. Shale output growth continues to outpace forecasts. The U.S. Energy Information Administration this month said United States production could top 11 million barrels per day by the end of 2018, a year earlier than it had expected just a month ago.   Heltman has pressed shale firms to show restraint even amid rising prices. And despite higher revenues, spending increases have so far been restrained. Producers have pushed up spending plans for all of 2018 by 10 percent over last year, according to a tally of 41 of the 65 producers tracked by financial services firm Cowen & Co. Some companies have maintained conservative assumptions for the average oil price for 2018, budgeting for prices between $50 and $55 a barrel. A higher price will mean they can cover new drilling investments and still pay dividends.  Investors are searching for firms that can find the optimal balance between the conflicting goals of controlling costs, paying dividends and increasing production. “We’re looking to invest in those companies who have been able to improve their production and win the battle as far as cost of extraction,” said Derek Rollingson, portfolio manager of the ICON Energy Fund (ICENX.O), which holds shares of more than a dozen U.S. shale producers. A further rise in oil prices, however, could lead investors to take on more risk and penalize more conservative companies, said Mike Breard, an energy analyst at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas. “If oil is $65 by Easter,” he said, “investors are going to go to the companies and say, ‘Why don’t you borrow more money and drill more wells?’” Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Additional reporting by Liz Hampton; Editing by Simon Webb and Brian Thevenot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-oil-record-strategy/analysis-u-s-shale-investors-still-waiting-on-payoff-from-oil-boom-idUKL1N1P01QI,23 Feb 2018,"U.S. oil production has topped

2018-02-23,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - The ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) of Hun Sen is poised to sweep a Senate election at the weekend, helping to consolidate the prime minister’s rule of more than 30 years amid a crackdown on the opposition. Sunday’s election for 58 members of the 62-strong Senate will see 123 members of parliament and 11,572 commune councillors vote at 33 polling stations across Cambodia. Two Senate members each are appointed by the king and the National Assembly. But rights groups and opposition politicians say the Senate vote is a farce that shows Hun Sen, who faces a national election in July, is not committed to multi-party democracy.  Almost half of the commune councillors have been stripped of their right to vote in Sunday’s election after their opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) was dissolved by a court last November at the request of Hun Sen’s government. “It’s the first time the Senate election will be held without the main opposition, without competition,” said Koul Panha of the Committee for Free and Fair Elections in Cambodia, an election watchdog.      About 5,007 CNRP commune councillors, or 44 percent of the 11,572 eligible to vote, had been stripped of their voting rights, he added. “It’s neither democratic nor free and fair.”  Only three small political parties are contesting the vote, apart from the CPP. “I expect that we will win by a lot,” said Sok Eysan, a CPP spokesman in the running for Sunday’s election. “It is 100 percent sure that I will be elected.”      The ruling CPP was the only party to hold rallies during the 14-day campaign period leading up to Sunday’s vote, the National Election Committee said.  The Senate, whose members have six-year terms, is seen as a rubber stamp institution, but the president has constitutional power as the head of state to sign bills into law when the king is abroad. Dissolution of the CNRP was followed by the arrest of its leader Kem Sokha last year for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government with U.S. help, an accusation both the United States and Kem Sokha have rejected. The CNRP ban effectively removes any major obstacles to Hun Sen’s re-election in July. Mu Sochua, the deputy president of the CNRP, called Sunday’s vote a “sham”, saying it would further widen Cambodia’s political divide. “It is a sham election for the sole interest of the CPP to maintain and control absolute power,” Mu Sochua, who lives abroad in self-imposed exile, told Reuters.

2018-02-23,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s January trade with North Korea fell to the lowest level since at least June 2014, the latest sign that China has kept up pressure on its isolated neighbor in line with United Nations trade sanctions.  China remains North Korea’s largest trading partner and sole major ally, though overall trade has fallen in recent months as the sanctions take effect. Trade between China and North Korea totaled $215.97 million in January, down 52 percent from the year-earlier period and 31 percent month-on-month, final trade numbers from the General Administration of Customs showed on Friday. The United States has led an international campaign to tighten sanctions on North Korea to force it to give up development of nuclear weapons and missiles capable of hitting the United States. China has backed successive rounds of sanctions but has been wary of U.S. efforts to toughen these further and has been accused by U.S. officials of not fully implementing existing U.N. steps. The Trump administration plans to announce on Friday what is being billed as the largest package of sanctions yet against North Korea to increase pressure on Pyongyang for its nuclear and ballistic missile tests, a senior administration official said. China’s exports to North Korea totaled $168.88 million in January compared with $257.73 million in December, while imports from North Korea were $47.09 million versus $54.68 million in December.  Data set to be released by China on Saturday will provide more detail on imports and exports of specific products to and from North Korea, shedding more light on which shipments were affected.

LNG imports totalled 5.18 million tonnes, compared with the previous record of 5.03 million tonnes set in December and up 51.2 percent from January, 2017, according to data on Friday from China’s General Administration of Customs. Purchases spiked to cover a surge in demand under Beijing’s push to replace coal with gas for households and factories, prompting companies to pull in cargoes from suppliers as diverse as Nigeria, Angola and Norway. Imports were affected by the timing of the Lunar New Year, which fell in February this year, rather than January as in 2017. Meanwhile, China’s January gasoline exports soared by two thirds to 1 million tonnes from a year earlier and were just shy of December’s all-time high of 1.23 million tonnes. Diesel exports rose a third to 1.28 million tonnes from January last year and were down from 1.99 million tonnes in December. November was a record of 2.026 million. Kerosene exports were 890,000 tonnes, up 8.4 percent year-on-year.

2018-02-23,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Oil that reached islands in southern Japan earlier this month is highly likely to have come from the sunken Iranian tanker Sanchi, the Japan Coast Guard said on Thursday.  Samples of oily matter that washed up on Feb. 8 on the shores of the Okinoerabu and Yoron islands in the Amami chain were found to be linked to the Sanchi’s sinking, the Coast Guard said. The Sanchi sank on Jan. 14 after colliding with a freighter on Jan. 6 in the world’s worst oil tanker disaster in decades. “Oily matter that arrived at the shores of the two islands is extremely likely to be linked to the Sanchi tanker incident, considering the similarity of the oil and the fact that there has not been any marine disaster involving oil spill in the nearby sea area,” a Coast Guard official told Reuters by phone on Thursday. Black clumps of oily matter first washed up on the shores of Takarajima island on Jan. 28 and other matter has since arrived at 21 other islands in southwestern Japan that are part of a chain of islands that includes Amami-Oshima and Okinawa, areas famous for pristine beaches and reef systems. (For a graphic on 'Iranian tanker oil' click tmsnrt.rs/2F0gLYE) The Sanchi, which the Coast Guard said was carrying 111,000 tonnes, or about 810,000 barrels, of condensate -  an ultra-light, highly flammable crude oil - sank after several explosions weakened the hull following the collision. Most of the fuel evaporated after the ship caught fire. The bodies of two sailors were recovered from the ship while a third body was pulled from the sea near the vessel. The remaining 29 crew of the ship are presumed dead. On Jan. 17, the Chinese government said the sunken tanker had created two oil slicks.  Japan’s environment ministry said in January it saw little chance that the spill would reach Japanese shores. Seawater samples taken from Jan. 29 to Feb. 2 at 14 different locations offshore southern Japan detected no oil pollution from the sunken tanker, the Coast Guard said in a  statement on Wednesday. An oil slick continues to be seen near where the Sanchi sank. The slick is located about 315 km (197 miles) west of Amami-Oshima island and is about 700 metres long and 20 metres wide, though oil has been evaporating from the fringes, the Coast Guard said in a statement on Thursday. Japanese and Chinese patrol boats have been searching for the missing crew in the area and sailing over the slick to try to dissipate the oil, it added.

2018-02-23,"* U.S. crude inventories fall - EIA * But exports surge while net imports drop to record low * U.S. crude output above 10 million bpd * The U.S. shale revolution: tmsnrt.rs/2EtJgen By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up on Friday, supported by lower U.S. crude inventories, but gains were capped by a surge in U.S. exports that dragged net imports in the world’s biggest fuel consumer to a record low. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $62.89 a barrel at 0206 GMT, up 12 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last settlement. Brent crude futures were up 5 cents, at $66.44 a barrel. U.S. crude oil stockpiles C-STK-T-EIA fell by 1.6 million barrels in the week to Feb. 16, to 420.48 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Thursday. “Part of that (inventory fall) is the shape of the oil curve which makes it uneconomic to store product,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader. The forward price curves for Brent and WTI are in a shape known as backwardation in which prices for immediate delivery are more expensive than those for later sale, making it uneconomical for traders to buy and store oil. The fall in inventories initially sparked price rises in late Thursday trading, but momentum faded in Asia on Friday as the focus turned on high U.S. exports. U.S. crude exports jumped to just above 2 million barrels per day (bpd) last week, the EIA data showed, close to a record high of 2.1 million hit in October. That helped pull down net imports to the lowest level on record of below 5 million bpd. The trade swings in the world’s biggest oil consuming country put prices under pressure on Friday, traders said. U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA was virtually unchanged at 10.27 million barrels per day (bpd), close to levels of top producer Russia and more than OPEC-kingpin Saudi Arabia pumps. Overall, however, oil markets remain well supported due to demand-growth coinciding with production restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia.

2018-02-23,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has called a meeting early next week with key senators and Cabinet officials to discuss potential changes to biofuels policy, which is coming under increasing pressure after a Pennsylvania refiner blamed the regulation for its bankruptcy, according to four sources familiar with the matter. The meeting comes as the oil industry and corn lobby – powerful forces in Washington – clash over the future of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a decade-old regulation that requires refiners to cover the cost of mixing biofuels such as corn-based ethanol into their fuel. Trump’s engagement reflects the high political stakes of protecting jobs in a key electoral state. Oil refiner Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES), which employs more than a thousand people in Philadelphia, declared bankruptcy last month and blamed the regulation for its demise. The meeting, scheduled for Tuesday, will include Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa, along with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, and potentially Energy Secretary Rick Perry, according to the four sources, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. One source said the meeting would focus on short-term solutions to help PES continue operating. PES is asking a bankruptcy judge to shed roughly $350 million of its current RFS compliance costs, owed to the EPA which administers the program, as part of its restructuring package. The other sources said the meeting will consider whether to cap prices for biofuel credits, let higher-ethanol blends be sold all year, and efforts to get speculators out of the market. Officials at the EPA, Agriculture Department, and Energy Department declined to comment. A White House official, Kelly Love, said she had no announcement on the matter at this time. The offices of Cruz, Ernst and Grassley did not immediately return requests for comment.  The sources said the options moving forward would be constrained by political and legal realities that have derailed previous efforts at reform. The Trump administration has already considered changes to the RFS sought by refiners this year - including reducing the amount of biofuels required to be blended annually under the regulation, or shifting the responsibility for blending to supply terminals - only to retreat in the face of opposition from corn-state lawmakers. The EPA is expected to weigh in officially in the coming weeks on PES’s request to the bankruptcy judge to be released from its compliance obligations. But any such move would likely draw a backlash from other U.S. refiners, who have no hope of receiving a waiver. Under the RFS, refiners must earn or purchase blending credits called RINs to prove they are complying with the regulation. As biofuels volumes quotas have increased, so have prices for the credits - meaning refiners that invested in blending facilities have benefited while those that have not, such as PES, have had to pay up. PES said its RFS compliance costs exceeded its payroll last year, and ranked only behind the cost of purchasing crude oil. Other issues may have contributed to PES’s financial difficulties. Reuters reported that PES’s investor backers withdrew from the company more than $594 million in a series of dividend-style distributions since 2012, even as regional refining economics slumped. Regulators and lawmakers have been considering how to cut the cost of the RFS to the oil industry. In recent months, for example, the EPA has contemplated expanding its use of an exemption available to small refineries - a move that would likely push down RIN prices, but which both the oil and corn industries have said would be unfair.  Cruz last year proposed limiting the price of RINs to 10 cents, a fraction of their current value – an idea that was roundly rejected by the ethanol industry as a disincentive for new ethanol blending infrastructure investment.     Senator John Cornyn, also a Texas Republican, is preparing draft legislation to overhaul the RFS in Congress that would include the creation of a new specialized RIN credit intended to push down prices - but it too faces resistance from both the corn and oil lobbies.

2018-02-23,"* MSCI ex-Japan up climbs 0.4 pct, Nikkei up 0.3 pct * In Wall Street, Dow, S&P gained while Nasdaq ticked lower * Market seen in ‘holding pattern’ ahead of key data next week * Yen holds on gains amid heightened market volatility By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Asian shares rebounded on Friday as comments from a Federal Reserve official eased worries that the central bank might raise rates more aggressively this year, while the safe-haven yen held on to its gains amid heightened volatility across markets. Financial markets have fluctuated wildly this month as investors fretted about how fast the Fed might raise rates in the wake of data showing a pick up in U.S. inflation. That in turn has stoked anxiety that many central banks will start to tighten policy in a hit to earnings, which have boomed thanks to a synchronized uptick in global growth. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.4 percent, but was still on track to end the week barely changed. Australian and New Zealand shares  were each up 0.5 percent while Japan’s Nikkei edged 0.3 percent higher and South Korea’s KOSPI index rose 1 percent. Asian shares took a knock on Thursday after minutes of the Fed’s last meeting showed policy makers were confident about the economic outlook, prompting some investors to boost the odds of faster rate hikes. The Fed started tightening its ultra-loose policy at the end of 2015 after keeping rates on hold for almost a decade. It raised interest rates three times in 2017 and is likely to tighten again in March. St Louis Fed President James Bullard tried to tamp down of expectations of four rate hikes in 2018, instead of the widely anticipated three increases, saying on Thursday policymakers need to be careful not to increase rates too quickly because that could slow the economy. That was enough to send U.S. shares rallying, despite the negative lead from Asia and Europe. On Wall Street, the Dow added 0.7 percent, the S&P 500 ended a tad firmer while the Nasdaq lost 0.11 percent. Analysts expect the market to be in a “holding pattern” ahead of a slew of important U.S. January activity data on Tuesday, followed by global surveys on manufacturing activity on Thursday. “We think inflation and yield fears are overblown near term,” JPMorgan analyst Marko Kolanovic wrote in a note. “However, speculators have amassed the largest short position in the history of bond futures trading. With such a large short position, there is always risk of profit taking, or worse a proper short-squeeze.” Bond prices gained, sending benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year yields <US10YT=RR > down from a four-year high of 2.9570 percent. In the foreign exchange market, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was flat at 89.736, with the euro a touch softer at $1.2324 after rising 0.4 percent on Wednesday. “Movements in EUR/USD seem to be mirroring movements in US equities, rising when equities sell off and weakening when they rally,” ANZ analysts wrote in a note to clients. The yen, which tends to benefit during times of heightened volatility or uncertainty, rose almost 1 percent overnight to last fetch  around 106.8 per dollar. In Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, data showed business confidence fell more than expected in February. Though Germany is set for solid growth in the first quarter, diverging monetary policy expectations with the United States sent the “trans-Atlantic spread” between German and U.S. 10-year borrowing costs to 222 bps, the highest in more than a year. Oil prices eased from two-week highs. U.S. crude was down 13 cents at $62.64 per barrel and Brent was last at $66.39. Spot gold ticked lower to $1330.26 an ounce. Reporting by Swati Pandey

2018-02-23,"(Repeats with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Highly intelligent people may be more rather than less likely to succumb to motivated reasoning, cherry-picking evidence to reinforce their existing beliefs and ignoring contradictory data. Even with people with high numerally skills were unable to reason analytically when the correct answer collided with their political beliefs, according to a forthcoming journal article in “Trends in Cognitive Sciences”. In fact, people with high information-processing skills were the most likely to express beliefs consistent with their political standpoint (“The partisan brain: an identity-based model of political belief” Van Bavel and Pereira, 2018). The authors focus on the role of ideology and political partisanship in the United States, but many of the same arguments about motivated reasoning apply to the energy sector. Many of the most important issues in the energy world, including the impact of OPEC on oil prices, climate change, the transition to clean energy, the future of fossil fuels and electric cars, renewable energy and peak oil, have become intensely emotional. In some cases, the intensity of energy debates has been heightened because it has become conflated with political partisanship. In others, the ferocity of disputes stem from origins that lie outside politics. Views about peaking oil demand, electric cars and OPEC have become an important marker of social identity, and people will cling to them even when presented with contradictory evidence. The problem with motivated reasoning is that it strongly distorts not just policy preferences but the way people process information and even the way they perceive and interpret the same piece of data. The authors blame much of this motivated reasoning on the “tribal nature” of the human mind, which leads people to value dogma over truth. Belief in a particular ideology, whether about politics or an issue in the energy sector, provides an important and satisfying sense of group belonging as well as access to resources and patronage. But when the demands of ideology and group membership clash with the evidence, many individuals will disregard contradictory data rather than modify their thinking or risk losing group approval. “Social identities have been shown to shape the way people interpret information. In turn, interpretations of the world shape political attitudes, judgements and behaviours,” Van Bavel and Pereira write. “Because people believe that they see the world around them objectively, members of other parties who disagree with them are seen as uninformed, irrational or biased.” “Partisan identities bias a broad range of judgements, even when presented with facts that contradict them,” according to the authors. What the authors describe as “our ancient capacity for tribalism”, recognising similar characteristics in others, may originally have served a useful evolutionary purpose. But it can be fatal to a calm and constructive analysis of problems whether they are about high politics or energy issues. Many of the fierce disagreements around future peaks in oil demand and the uptake of electric vehicles, for example, or the impact of OPEC on oil prices, are not really disagreements about technical issues but disputes about values and ideology. Tribalism is what turns so many discussions about energy into an emotive shouting match between opponents who accuse each other of being at best uninformed and incompetent or at worst mendacious. In most cases, energy professionals would be better served by dialling back on the heated rhetoric and exploring the issues more calmly and with an open mind. Unfortunately, much of the analysis in the energy sector comes from individuals and institutions promoting a distinctive viewpoint rather than taking a more data-driven empirical approach. Dispassionate analysis has often become inextricably mixed up with highly motivated lobbying and advocacy, to the severe detriment to the quality of the analysis. In general, individuals and institutions can be good analysts, or good lobbyist/advocates, but not both. Mixing the two is almost always a mistake.

2018-02-23,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s presidential frontrunner is not opposed to foreign investment in the country’s oil, his top energy adviser said, but his government would make dramatic changes to energy strategy, including a new focus on refining rather than crude exports.   In perhaps the most significant change envisioned by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the favorite to win the July 1 election, Mexico would seek to end decades of exporting crude in three years, a lawmaker who Lopez Obrador has tapped to be his future energy minister said in an interview.  Instead, Mexico should turn its focus to value-added fuels, processing crude domestically to produce more gasoline and diesel at refineries owned by state oil company Pemex, Rocio Nahle told Reuters late on Wednesday. “In a three-year period, at the latest, we need to try to consume our own fuels and not depend on foreign gasoline,” said Nahle at her congressional office in Mexico City. That could spell bad news for U.S. refiners. Mexico is their biggest foreign market currently, with purchases of gasoline and diesel growing rapidly in recent years to an average of 808,000 barrels per day (bpd) last year, or about two-thirds of total domestic demand, according to Pemex data.       Pemex’s total crude exports, mostly to U.S. Gulf Coast refiners as well as Asian and European buyers, averaged 1.17 million bpd in 2017, down from a peak of 1.87 million bpd in 2004.  But Latin American countries are increasingly seeking to add value to their exports of raw commodities. Nahle gave details of what that might mean for Mexico - modernizing Pemex’s six existing refineries, and building one or two new ones that would add crude processing capacities of between 300,000 and 600,000 bpd. Possible sites in the oil-producing states of Tabasco and Campeche had been identified and the new facilities would be financed by either public funds or some kind of public-private partnership, she said. “We are doing the technical, economic analysis to see if it (would be) one big refinery, or two medium-sized ones,” said Nahle, a petrochemical engineer who represents the Gulf coast state of Veracruz, also a major oil producer, in Congress. A Lopez Obrador government would aim to improve the existing refineries’ productivity in about eight months solely using public funds, Nahle said. Pemex refineries currently have the capacity to process about 1.6 million bpd, though last year they only refined about 770,000 bpd. The company produces about 1.9 million bpd of crude, down from a 2004 peak of 3.4 million bpd. Leftist Lopez Obrador holds a double-digit lead over his nearest rival in many opinion polls, although a young center-right contender has been gaining ground. Nahle, who leads Lopez Obrador’s Morena party in the lower house of Congress, said, if elected, their government would closely examine all the deals made under President Enrique Pena Nieto’s 2013-2014 oil opening, but welcomed private investment. “We in Morena are open to investment, we are open to the world,” Nahle said.  Lopez Obrador initially opposed the oil reform, which ended Pemex’s decades-old monopoly, but seems to have softened his stance since the changes have begun to be implemented. To date, some 90 exploration and production contracts have been awarded to a wide range of oil companies over eight auctions, including nine deepwater blocks won by Royal Dutch Shell at a tender last month. The government forecasts that the companies would invest around $150 billion if the projects are commercially successfully over the lifetime of the contracts.  In recent months, Lopez Obrador has said that he would review the contracts to make sure there was no corruption involved.  Nahle said his team had already looked at publicly available contracts without finding problems, but would study files that are not in the public sphere in detail if they win the election. If a Lopez Obrador government were to determine that already-signed contracts were flawed or tainted by corruption, it would likely not authorize future oil auctions, Nahle said. “It would be very rash for me to tell you now that we are going to hand over more blocks, no? Or to say we are never going to do more blocks,” said Nahle.   “We will see at every moment what is best for Mexico,” she said, adding that the current government had been “irresponsible” by auctioning off too many oil and gas blocks. “Nowhere in the world have we seen handed over (to private oil companies) such a stream of blocks ... it seems like an excessive rush,” she said. Other Lopez Obrador advisers have said in recent days that the team was happy with the contracts signed under the outgoing government. While she said Lopez Obrador was open to authorizing more equity joint ventures with Pemex, also allowed by the energy opening, Nahle stressed the need for Pemex to seek partnerships outside Mexico. “Pemex needs to go to Asia, Pemex needs to go to Texas, Pemex needs to go to South America to find partners ... it’s a priority for us that Pemex is truly globalized,” she said.
