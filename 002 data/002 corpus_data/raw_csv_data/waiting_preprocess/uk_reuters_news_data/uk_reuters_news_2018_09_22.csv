2018-09-22,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - OPEC and its allies reduced oil output in August as a drop in Iranian supply due to U.S. sanctions derailed their attempts to raise production to agreed levels, delegates said on Saturday as the energy producers prepared to hold talks in Algiers. The development further raises pressure on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to boost supply amid calls from U.S. President Donald Trump to lower oil prices. On Friday, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters OPEC and its allies led by Russia were considering the possibility of raising crude supplies by a further 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) as U.S. sanctions on OPEC’s third-largest producer, Iran, bite into Tehran’s exports. “If an increase in production is proposed there will be plenty of market counter-argument that it reduces even further the available spare capacity,” Olivier Jakob from consultancy Petromatrix said. “Saudi Arabia has made the mistake of trying to compensate for the loss of Iranian supplies with just-in-time replacement; but the oil market is looking for greater supply security than that. As a result, the strength of oil prices is now putting oil demand growth at risk,” he added. An OPEC and non-OPEC monitoring committee gathering in the Algerian capital this weekend found that oil producers’ compliance with a supply-reduction agreement reached 129 percent in August, two committee delegates said.  This compares with a compliance level of 109 percent for July, indicating that the group went beyond its agreed cut.  Oman’s oil minister Mohammed bin Hamad Al-Rumhy told reporters on Saturday that OPEC and non-OPEC producers overachieved on pledged output cuts by 600,000 bpd in August, putting the reduction at around 2.4 million bpd. OFF-TARGET Seeking to reverse a downturn in oil prices that began in 2014, OPEC, Russia and other allies decided in late 2016 to reduce supply by some 1.8 million bpd.  In June this year, however, after months of cutting by more than their pact had called for amid involuntary reductions from Venezuela and other producers, they agreed to boost output by returning to 100 percent compliance.  That equates to an increase of about 1 million bpd, but the latest figures show they are some way from achieving that target. Oil LCOc1 reached $80 a barrel this month, prompting Trump to demand again that OPEC bring down prices. “We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!” he wrote on Twitter. Higher gasoline prices for U.S. consumers could create a political headache for Trump before November mid-term congressional elections. OPEC sources said any official action to raise output would require OPEC to hold what it calls an extraordinary meeting - a proposal that is not on the table yet. But the joint OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial committee known as the JMMC, which meets on Sunday, can still recommend a further increase in output if needed, the sources said.

2018-09-22,"BERLIN, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The German Environment Agency (UBA) is doubtful about the environmental benefits of introducing incentives for drivers of older diesel vehicles to trade them in for newer models, a German newspaper reported on Saturday. Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to hold a high-level meeting on Sunday to discuss whether to require the car industry to carry out costly hardware upgrades for older diesel vehicles to reduce inner-city pollution, government sources said on Friday. Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer, a member of Merkel’s Bavarian CSU allies, favours incentives to exchange older vehicles for newer ones to reduce overall pollution caused by the fleet of cars on the road and to avoid driving bans. But Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper cited an internal paper from UBA as saying this would not help much: “In the best case scenario, an exchange premium would only reduce nitric oxide pollution by 0.7 micrograms per cubic meter.” That would be a very small amount compared with the overall pollution, which is at between 73 and 78 micrograms in cities like Stuttgart or Munich, the newspaper cited UBA as saying. UBA, which is Germany’s main environmental protection agency, was not immediately available for comment. Older diesel vehicles such as those of the Euro-4 standard sometimes have lower emissions than the more modern Euro-6 standard diesel vehicles. Scheuer has not ruled out the possibility of a retrofit with catalysts, which is favoured by the Environment Ministry - run by the Social Democrats - but he considers that solution to be more complicated technically and more expensive. Merkel has tasked Scheuer with finding a solution to make older diesel cars cleaner and to avoid large-scale bans on diesel cars. The car industry has lobbied against equipping old diesel models with extra emissions control technology because that could cost billions of euros. $1 = 0.8511 euros

2018-09-22,"TRIPOLI, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Saturday its subsidiary the Arabian Gulf Oil Company (AGOCO) had restored production at 3,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd) at an abandoned well in the eastern Messla field. After 16 years of inactivity, production resumed at the well (HH86-65) using the latest drilling techniques developed by U.S. oilfield services company Schlumberger, the NOC said in a statement. The oil-rich North African country was producing more than 1.6 million bpd before a 2011 NATO-backed uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi and led to political fragmentation and armed conflict. Messla’s output was around 70,000 bpd. Since 2014, Libya has been divided between rival governments and military factions based in the east and west of the country, causing political deadlock and an economic crisis. However, the NOC has continued to function relatively normally across Libya, which relies on oil exports for most of its income. Output has been hit by attacks on oil facilities and blockades, though last year it partially recovered to around one million barrels per day. Earlier this month, the NOC suffered a shooting attack on its Tripoli headquarters, claimed by Islamic State militants, that killed two people and wounded 25. But it continued to manage its operations as normal, it said. Along with the Tripoli-based central bank, the NOC is one of the only state enterprises still functioning well despite the conflict.

2018-09-22,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Saturday that Washington would not wait to impose sanctions on any shippers helping to get fuel to North Korea, in an apparent warning to Russia days after the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations accused Moscow of cheating on the measures. North Korea continues to employ tactics to evade U.N. sanctions, Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement, adding that U.N. member states are required to prohibit ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum fuel to the hermit country. “The United States will not hesitate to impose sanctions on any individual, entity, or vessel supporting North Korea’s illicit activities, regardless of nationality,” Nauert said. The 15-member U.N. Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  But the United States and Russia have recently shown cracks in the unity of the council over the sanctions. Washington has “evidence of consistent and wide-ranging Russian violations” of the sanctions, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley said on Monday. Russia was helping North Korea illegally obtain fuel through transfers at sea, had refused to expel a North Korean whom the Security Council blacklisted last year, and had pushed for changes to an independent U.N. report on sanctions violations to cover up breaches by Russians, she said. Russia said after Haley’s comments that Moscow had not pressured the authors of the U.N. report and blamed Haley for heightening tensions. With the warning on fuel shipments, the Trump administration signalled it was keeping pressure on Pyongyang even after saying there has been progress. President Donald Trump this week hailed a summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, and said there had been “tremendous progress” with North Korea on several fronts including Pyongyang’s denuclearisation.   Washington has tracked some 148 cases this year of tankers delivering fuel to North Korea in breach of a U.N. cap of 500,000 barrels a year. Haley has not said how many of those transfers may have involved Russia.  Both Russia and China have suggested the Security Council discuss easing sanctions after Trump and Kim met in June and Kim pledged to work toward denuclearisation. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday the United States is working to set up another summit between Trump and Kim after their unprecedented meeting in Singapore, but there is still work to do.

2018-09-22,"RALEIGH, N.C., CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Communities in North and South Carolina along waterways to the Atlantic coast faced rising floods on Saturday more than a week after the arrival of Hurricane Florence, which has killed at least 40 people. Officials in towns and cities in both states were filling sandbags and finalizing evacuation plans, eyeing some rivers that are swollen by heavy rainfall but not expected to crest until Sunday. In Conway, South Carolina, where President Donald Trump visited this week, images posted by the city on Saturday showed water lapping at homes in an area where residents were being evacuated. In Lee’s Landing in Horry County, some residents used boats to get to safety as the Waccamaw River spilled into neighborhoods, a local CBS affiliate reported.  “If you can get out, get out,” Joseph Tanner, the county’s fire rescue chief, said in an interview with WBTW News 13. More than two dozen flood gauges in North and South Carolina showed flooding on Saturday, the National Weather Service said.  At least 40 deaths have been attributed to the storm, with most of those in North Carolina. About 5,000 people across North Carolina have been rescued by boat or helicopter since the storm made landfall, twice as many as in Hurricane Matthew two years ago, according to state officials. Thousands of people remained in shelters. Nearly 550 roads remained closed, the state’s department of transportation said, warning motorists not to travel in 17 southeastern counties worst-hit by Florence. Duke Energy Corp (DUK.N) said on Friday that breaches in a cooling lake dam forced it to shut down its natural gas-fired  L.V. Sutton plant in North Carolina. The utility said it could not rule out the possibility that coal ash from a dump adjacent to the plant, which formerly burned coal, might be flowing into the nearby Cape Fear River. Coal ash can contaminate water and harm fish and wildlife. The flooding from Florence has also caused 21 hog “lagoons,” which store manure from pig farms, to overflow in North Carolina, possibly contaminating standing water, according to state officials. North Carolina is one of the leading hog-producing states in the country. Several sewer systems in the region also have released  untreated or partly treated sewage and storm water into waterways over the last week, local media reported.

Nigeria, an OPEC member, is Africa’s largest oil producer and crude sales make up around two-thirds of government revenues in West Africa’s largest economy. The dilapidated state of its refineries means the country imports most of its refined fuel. The Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) and Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) accused U.S. oil major Chevron of attempting to sack thousands of Nigerian workers in violation of their contracts. “NUPENG and PENGASSAN will not hesitate to embark on nationwide industrial action on this matter and we have already placed our members on red alert should the management of Chevron remain recalcitrant or adamant to rescind its anti-labour decision,” the unions said in a joint statement. NUPENG President William Akporeha told Reuters the industrial action referred to would be a nationwide strike by members of the unions, who cover a broad range of jobs across the country’s oil industry. Chevron did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Towns and cities across the state were filling thousands of sandbags, finalizing evacuation plans and organizing rescue crews as they nervously watched swollen rivers rise near or beyond their flood stages, a week after Florence dumped some three feet of rain on the region. In Lee’s Landing, a community in Horry County, a county of 290,000 people on the Atlantic Coast that includes Myrtle Beach, residents have started to evacuate by boat as the Waccamaw River continues to flood over its banks and spill into neighborhoods, a local CBS affiliate reported. “If you can get out, get out,” said Joseph Tanner, the county’s fire rescue chief, during an interview with WBTW News 13. The county has assembled several rescue crews to save people from floods and filled thousands of sandbags over the last couple of days, officials said on social media. Thirty-one deaths have been attributed to the storm in North Carolina, eight in South Carolina and one in Virginia. To the north in Georgetown County, water continued to drain into the five rivers and several reservoirs that run through the county of 60,000 people as officials prepared to hand out thousands of sandbags on Saturday. Dangerous flooding and evacuations may begin early next week, officials said. “We know it’s coming and we hope that it won’t be near as bad as the models have predicted,” Georgetown County Emergency Management Director Sam Hodge during a Facebook Live event on Friday. “Today is the day that you need to start preparation for those evacuations.” Thirty flood gauges in North and South Carolina showed flooding on Saturday, according to the National Weather Service. A week after Florence made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, North Carolina is still feeling its effects, Governor Roy Cooper said. “Some locations won’t see rivers crest until this weekend and flooding won’t subside until next week,” he said in a Twitter post. In Bladen County, North Carolina, about 100 people and 33 animals were rescued “in a dangerous operation in the middle of the night” after a dam burst, Cooper said in another post. Some 4,700 people across North Carolina have been rescued by boat or helicopter since the storm made landfall, twice as many as in Hurricane Matthew two years ago, according to state officials. About 10,000 people remained in shelters. The coastal city of Wilmington, North Carolina, was still mostly cut off by floodwaters on Friday. Some 650 roads remained closed, the state’s department of transportation said, warning motorists not to travel in 17 southeastern counties worst-hit by Florence. More than 33,000 homes and businesses were without power in the Carolinas on Saturday morning. Duke Energy Corp said on Friday that breaches in a cooling lake dam forced it to shut down its natural gas-fired L.V. Sutton plant in North Carolina. The utility said it could not rule out the possibility that coal ash from a dump adjacent to the plant, which formerly burned coal, might be flowing into the nearby Cape Fear River. Coal ash can contaminate water and harm fish and wildlife. The flooding from Florence has also caused 21 hog “lagoons,” which store manure from pig farms, to overflow in North Carolina, possibly contaminating standing water, according to the state’s Department of Environmental Quality. North Carolina is one of the leading hog-producing states in the country. Several sewer systems in the region also have released untreated or partly treated sewage and storm water into waterways over the last week, local media reported.

2018-09-22,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will provide more support for its nuclear firms to go overseas and strengthen their position on the international market, according to new draft legislation submitted to the industry for consultation on Friday. “The state will encourage and support the positive and orderly participation of its enterprises in the international market” and promote the export of nuclear equipment, fuel and services, the draft Atomic Energy Law says. China aims to bring its total installed nuclear capacity to 58 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2020, up from 37 GW at the end of June this year, but it also has ambitions to dominate the global market and has created a unified third-generation reactor brand known as the “Hualong One” to sell overseas.  China has already signed a series of preliminary agreements with countries like Brazil, Argentina, Uganda and Cambodia and it is also undergoing a technical approval process for the Hualong One in Britain.  The government also published new guidelines last month aimed at promoting its own technical standards in foreign markets and play a “leading role” in the global nuclear technology standardization process.    However, its only overseas nuclear project so far is the Chashma nuclear complex in Pakistan.  China’s new draft atomic energy law sets out the government’s responsibilities when it comes to disclosing information about the safety and environmental impact of nuclear power. It also includes clauses calling for the “convergence” of military and civilian research into nuclear energy. It calls for the establishment of a uranium reserve and a system for storing, transporting and treating spent fuel. Members of the public are invited to submit their opinions about the legislation to the Ministry of Justice before Oct. 19.      China was once regarded as one of the bright spots for the global nuclear sector, but its ambitious domestic reactor building program has slowed considerably, with no new projects approved since 2016. In a bid to guarantee safety in the wake of Japan’s Fukushima disaster in 2011, China promised to deploy only new and safer reactor technology, including Westinghouse’s AP1000 and the EPR designed by France’s Areva. But the untested models have been repeatedly delayed amid design flaws and huge cost overruns, and Beijing is now expected to struggle to meet its 58 GW target.

2018-09-22,"RALEIGH (Reuters) - Residents of Georgetown County, South Carolina, where five rivers flow into the ocean, were preparing on Friday for a deluge of water in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence, which has killed at least 40 people. The county of 60,000 people, on the Atlantic coast between Myrtle Beach and Charleston, is one of several areas in the Carolinas waiting anxiously as rivers start to crest, a week after Florence dumped some three feet of rain on the region.  Flooding could begin early next week, officials said during a community meeting on Thursday, as water continues to drain into rivers and reservoirs across North and South Carolina. The city of Georgetown on Friday was handing out 15,000 sandbags as the county developed plans to evacuate residents.  “Please heed the warnings,” Sheriff Lane Cribb said. “Protecting lives and property will be our goal ...

2018-09-22,"(Adds information about plant status, updates Duke share price) Sept 21 (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp said it shut down a North Carolina natural gas plant due to flooding as the deluge of water continued in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence, which has killed more than 40 people. Duke also said it cannot rule out the possibility that coal ash from another plant is flowing into nearby waters. Water breached the cooling lake dam at Duke’s 625-megawatt natural gas L.V. Sutton plant, causing the company to shut the plant. Water is now exiting the cooling lake through breaches, one large and several smaller, the company said in a statement on Friday. However, the company later in the day issued a statement saying the situation remains stable at the plant. The company did not provide any further information on the status of the incident. Hurricane Florence brought several feet of rain to parts of North Carolina over a period of days, and the historic level of storm flooding is not expected to subside until next week. Duke reported two coal ash leaks from a retired plant in Wilmington, North Carolina, following storm Florence. One came from its shuttered Sutton Power Plant on Saturday and a second on Sunday, according to federal officials. Officials had worried the water would overwhelm several pits where coal ash had been stored, potentially contaminating rivers. “We have not been able to get our feet on the ground to get the water quality sampling” due to flooding in the area, Michael Regan, Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, said during North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper’s Hurricane Florence briefing on Friday. “We plan to conduct flyovers and partner with the Department of Transportation to see if we can ascertain ... whether any coal ash has filtered into the Cape Fear River,” Regan said. Separately, company spokeswoman Paige Sheehan told Reuters they cannot rule out the possibility that coal ash might have entered the Cape Fear River. Coal ash collects at the bottom of basins, making it difficult to determine when ash escapes from a site. Coal ash can contaminate water and harm fish and wildlife. Ash pits and other embankments have ruptured under heavy rain in the past, and Duke Energy had agreed to secure the sites in North Carolina’s lowland areas - but that work is ongoing. The company’s shares closed down almost 1 percent at $79.82 on Friday. Reporting by Ankur Banerjee and Swati Verma in Bengaluru and
