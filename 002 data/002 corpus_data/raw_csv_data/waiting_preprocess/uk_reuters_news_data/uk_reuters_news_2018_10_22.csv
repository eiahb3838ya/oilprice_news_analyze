2018-10-22,"PARIS (Reuters) - Total’s (TOTF.PA) chief executive said on Monday he would attend an investment conference in Saudi Arabia this week, despite rising pressure on business leaders to drop out after Riyadh admitted a journalist was killed at its Istanbul consulate. Saudi Arabia has drawn strong international criticism after saying that Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent critic of Saudi rulers, was killed inside the consulate - after two weeks of denials that it had anything to do with his disappearance. “I am convinced that an ‘empty chairs at the table’ strategy serves no useful purpose, especially when it comes to respect for human rights,” Total’s CEO Patrick Pouyanné said in a statement. The French oil major’s decision comes despite President Emmanuel Macron’s decision last week to pull his finance minister out of the Future Investment Initiative conference. It contrasts with the decision of Siemens’ CEO not to attend the conference. Another French energy company, state-owned EDF (EDF.PA), said late on Monday its CEO would not attend the conference, citing a conflicting meeting in Paris. Total and Saudi Aramco co-own one of the largest refining facilities in the world, the SATORP complex in the eastern Saudi city of Jubail. EDF hopes to sell a nuclear plant in Saudi Arabia and has submitted a bid in a Saudi tender for the project, along with several other nuclear vendors. Paris and Riyadh enjoy close diplomatic and commercial relations spanning energy, finance and weapons. But France, which considers Riyadh a bulwark against Iranian influence in the Middle East, now faces a delicate balancing act in its response to the incident. Macron has sought to downplay the importance of trade relations with Riyadh, saying that Saudi Arabia was not a major client of France, although from 2008-17 it was the second biggest purchaser of French arms.

2018-10-22,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Biosev SA (BSEV3.SA), the Brazilian sugar and ethanol producer controlled by global commodities trader Louis Dreyfus [AKIRAU.UL], is in talks to sell more assets in the country as it seeks to cut debt, two sources with knowledge of the plans told Reuters on Monday. Biosev, which announced the sale of a sugar and ethanol mill a month ago, hired Datagro Financial, the financial services division of Sao Paulo-based consultancy Datagro, and the investment banking unit of Banco Santander Brasil SA (SANB11.SA) to assist in the process to sell other mills, the sources said. Shares of Biosev (BSEV3.SA) surged 37.2 percent to close at 4.54 reais on Monday, their highest price in seven months. Traded volume was more than 20 times larger than the daily average during last week’s sessions at Sao Paulo exchange B3.  Biosev and Datagro declined to comment. Santander did not immediately respond to a request to comment. The possible asset sale comes seven months after Louis Dreyfus bailed out the money-losing unit with a capital injection of $1.05 billion and follows the departure of former Biosev Chief Executive Rui Chammas, who was replaced by Juan José Blanchard in July.   “Yes, there is an asset sale process ongoing,” said the first source, who asked for anonymity because negotiations are private. The two sources said Biosev wants to sell some mills.     A month ago, Biosev announced the sale of its Estivas unit in the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte for 203.6 million reais ($55.3 million) to local group Pipa Agroindustrial. At the time, Chief Financial Officer Gustavo Lopes Theodozio told Reuters the company planned to use proceeds from the sale to pay down a debt that was not included in a recent debt restructuring. The source said that the logic behind the process was to raise the use of installed capacity in remaining mills after an eventual sale of units and reduce debt, which hovered around 6 billion reais.  The second source, who is also familiar with the restructuring process at Biosev, told Reuters the company is trying to sell a mill in Brazil’s centre-west, a relatively new frontier for sugar companies, and another in Sao Paulo state, Brazil’s top cane belt. Biosev has a large plant idled in centre-west’s Mato Grosso do Sul state, the Maracaju mill, whose operations were interrupted late last year. In total, considering the Maracaju mill, Biosev has nine plants in Brazil, the world’s largest sugar producer. It also operates a sugar exporting terminal in the coastal city of Guarujá (Sao Paulo state). The sources did not want to specify the stage of the talks or address whether a possible leak could have led to the share surge on Monday.

2018-10-22,"YAOUNDE (Reuters) - Cameroonian President Paul Biya has won re-election by a landslide, official results showed on Monday, extending his 36-year rule despite claims from two leading opposition candidates that the vote was fraudulent.  At 85, Biya is the oldest leader in sub-Saharan Africa and the victory cements his place as one of Africa’s longest-serving rulers. Most Cameroonians have known only him as president. But looming over his victory are allegations of ballot stuffing and intimidation, while turnout was low because of a secessionist uprising in the Anglophone Northwest and Southwest regions in which hundreds, including unarmed civilians, have died over the past year.   Biya won 71 percent of the vote on a turnout of 54 percent, according to figures announced by the Constitutional Council. He won strongly in nine of 10 regions, including the South and East where he took more than 90 percent of the vote. His closest rival, Maurice Kamto, won 14 percent overall.  “Thank you for your renewed and large confidence,” Biya said on Twitter. “Let us now join in taking up, together, the challenges that confront us.” The announcement follows two weeks of tension in the coffee- and oil-producing country where, despite economic growth above 4 percent a year since the last election, most people live in poverty.  Kamto claimed victory for himself on Oct. 8 based on his campaign’s figures, and in recent days police silenced opposition marches in the port city of Douala where he is popular.  “We solemnly and categorically reject these manufactured results and refuse to recognise the legitimacy of the Head of State,” Kamto said in a statement. “We will use all means of law to restore the truth of the ballot box.” Third-placed candidate Cabral Libii also rejected the results, saying they did not “reflect reality” in Cameroon.  Authorities have defended the voting process. “The election was free, fair and credible in spite of the security challenges in the English-speaking regions,” the President of Constitutional Council, Clement Atangana, said on Monday. The secessionist movement began in reaction to a government clampdown on peaceful protests calling for an end to the marginalisation of Cameroon’s English-speaking minority. Police killed civilians, sparking further protests.  The army burned villages and killed unarmed civilians, residents told Reuters, forcing thousands to flee to French-speaking regions or neighbouring Nigeria. Ghost towns are all that remain of once vibrant cities in those regions. Turnout was 5 percent in the Northwest and 16 percent in the Southwest. In an area of 5 million English speakers, less than 100,000 voted.  Despite the unrest, and a desire among the young for change, the opposition appeared unable to mount a credible challenge to Biya who, despite long absences in Switzerland, has kept core support. He has also benefited from apathy from many who saw no point in voting. “I voted for the opposition even though I did not trust them. I wanted anything but Paul Biya,” said Jerome, an unemployed 32-year-old. “My three children will have no future as long as he is there.” The only current African president to have ruled longer than Biya is Equatorial Guinea’s Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.

2018-10-22,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed lower after choppy trade on Monday, as some investors showed signs of earnings season nerves, while political worries in Europe led the dollar to strengthen against the euro and sterling. The euro continued its slide on uncertainty over Italy’s budget and the British pound fell on news that Brexit negotiations with the European Union over Northern Ireland remained in deadlock. The U.S. Treasury yield curve was the flattest in more than two weeks, while two-year note yields hit their highest level in a decade. Gains in longer-dated notes were limited due to worries about rising inflation pressures and further U.S. Federal Reserve rate hikes. Fixed income trading appeared to weigh on U.S financial companies, making the sector the biggest drag on the S&P 500. A flat yield curve tends to hurt bank profits.   The third-quarter earnings season and U.S. midterm elections were also dampening equity investor enthusiasm, along with the rising dollar, according to money managers. “We’ve seen decent results but not universally and there are some negative issues companies have talked about,” said Tim Ghriskey, Chief Investment Strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.  Investors should expect more volatility at least until U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6, Ghriskey said.  “People are looking at the negatives and saying that it’s a situation where there are more headwinds. At least until the midterms, it’s going to be difficult to make any significant progress on the upside. The drift will be lower,” said Alan Lancz, president, Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc., an investment advisory firm in Toledo, Ohio. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 126.93 points, or 0.5 percent, to 25,317.41, the S&P 500 lost 11.9 points, or 0.43 percent, to 2,755.88 and the Nasdaq Composite added 19.60 points, or 0.26 percent, to 7,468.63. Investors looked ahead to the peak week for the U.S. earnings season, with Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Caterpillar among the companies reporting. Helped by a strong economy and deep corporate tax cuts, S&P 500 earnings per share are expected to grow 22 percent in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv estimates.

2018-10-22,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil futures were little changed on Monday after paring earlier losses despite Saudi Arabia’s pledge to raise crude production to a record high, two weeks before U.S. sanctions potentially choke off Iranian supplies.       Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told Russia’s TASS news agency that his country had no intention of unleashing a 1973-style oil embargo on Western consumers, but rather was focused on raising output to compensate for supply losses elsewhere, such as Iran. Falih said Saudi Arabia would soon raise output to 11 million barrels per day (bpd) from the current 10.7 million. He added that Riyadh had capacity to increase production to 12 million bpd.     “Oil prices are finely balanced in today’s trading session despite the Saudi pledge to boost production. It is still not a foregone conclusion that the kingdom’s production increase will be enough to compensate for the potential output loss from Iran and Venezuela,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy in London. Brent LCOc1 crude futures for December delivery rose 5 cents to settle at $79.83 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) CLc1 for November delivery also rose 5 cents to settle at $69.17 on its last day as the U.S. front-month. In intraday trade, WTI fell as low as $68.27, its lowest since Sept. 14. Several U.S. lawmakers, meanwhile, have suggested imposing sanctions on Saudi Arabia over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The kingdom, the world’s largest oil exporter, pledged to retaliate against any sanctions with “bigger measures.” “The White House’s dithering highlights the unwillingness of the Trump Administration to take any meaningful action against Riyadh, just a few weeks prior to the U.S. Iran sanctions coming into play,” said Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index by online trading services firm Gain Capital, in a note. “A veiled threat of using oil as a weapon is essentially tying U.S. hands. Investors are watching and waiting for the next chapter before positioning themselves accordingly,” Cincotta said. U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil sector start on Nov. 4 and analysts believe up to 1.5 million bpd in supply could be at risk. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed in June to boost supply to make up for the expected disruption to Iranian exports. An internal document reviewed by Reuters suggested OPEC is struggling to add barrels as an increase in Saudi supply was offset by declines elsewhere, including Iran and Venezuela. The outlook for demand next year, meanwhile, is deteriorating.  OPEC estimates demand for its crude will fall to an average of 31.8 million bpd next year, from an average 32.8 million bpd this year.

2018-10-22,"(Repeats to add PIX, TV) YAOUNDE, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Cameroonian President Paul Biya won an emphatic election victory with 71 percent of the vote, the Constitutional Council announced on Monday, extending his 36-year rule and cementing his place as one of Africa’s longest-standing rulers. The widely-expected win gives the 85-year-old a seventh term in office and could see him in power until at least the age of 92. The only current African president to have ruled longer is Equatorial Guinea’s Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. Most Cameroonians have known just one president. Victory in the Oct. 7 poll came amid claims from opposition candidates that the election was marred by fraud, including ballot stuffing and voter intimidation. The Constitutional Council rejected all 18 petitions claiming fraud last week. In addition, violence connected to a separatist movement in the western Anglophone regions forced tens of thousands to flee in the lead up to the vote, and kept the vast majority there from casting their ballot. The announcement follows two weeks of political tension in the coffee and oil-producing country, during which Biya’s leading rival Maurice Kamto claimed victory based on his campaign’s figures, and as police tried to silence opposition marches in the port city of Douala. Monday’s official results showed Kamto won 14 percent of the vote. Biya won with a big margin in nine of the 10 regions. In the South and East regions he won over 90 percent of the vote. Authorities have defended the process. “The election was free, fair and credible in spite of the security challenges in the English-speaking regions,” said the President of Constitutional Council, Clement Atangana, on Monday.

2018-10-22,"(Reuters) - Shares of oilfield services provider Halliburton Co fell on Monday after the company warned that fourth-quarter earnings would come in below analysts forecasts amid ongoing weakness in the North American hydraulic fracturing market.  Halliburton, the largest provider of hydraulic fracturing services, has seen demand for its services soften as U.S. producers cut down on spending and transportation bottlenecks in the Permian Basin of west Texas and New Mexico pushed the price of regional crude lower.  The company had previously warned that slowing growth in the largest U.S. shale basin would impact its results.  Halliburton said it expects the U.S. onshore sector to find a “bottom” in the fourth quarter, as producers reset 2019 budgets and next year begin working through a record backlog of drilled-but-uncompleted wells.  The company on Monday said it anticipates a fourth quarter profit of 37 to 40 cents per share. Analysts were forecasting a profit of 49 cents per share, according to Refinitiv.  While demand for its North American completions services has weakened, the firm’s international business is showing signs of recovery, the company said on Monday, as global oil prices have climbed to around $80 a barrel. Halliburton’s international revenue rose 5 percent from the second quarter to $2.4 billion, while in North America, revenues decreased 2 percent sequentially to $3.74 billion. North American revenues are up 18.2 percent year-over-year. “Our international business continues to show signs of a steady recovery,” Chief Executive Officer Jeff Miller said in a statement. Shares of Halliburton were down about 2 percent at $36.93 in early trade. In September, they fell to a roughly two and a half year low after the company warned of slowing U.S. activity.  “We’re not exactly doing cartwheels given near-term pricing and utilization headwinds in the domestic hydraulic fracturing market,” analysts for Tudor Pickering Holt & Co wrote in a note on Monday. Rival Schlumberger NV also managed a slight third quarter profit beat last week but cautioned that North American growth would slow due to the bottlenecks and hurt results next quarter.

2018-10-22,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2OD02A9 By John Kemp LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers accelerated their profit-taking in crude oil and refined fuels last week, as confidence in the previous price rally faltered and the market fell. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by 133 million barrels in the week to Oct. 16. Fund managers have cut their combined position by a total of 187 million barrels in the last three weeks after earlier raising it by 196 million barrels in the previous five weeks. Funds now hold a net position equivalent to 912 million barrels, the lowest since Aug. 21 and before that September 2017, and far below previous peaks of 1.4 billion in April and almost 1.5 billion in January. Liquidation of old long positions again led the change last week (-119 million barrels) while the number of new short positions increased only slightly (+14 million barrels). Portfolio managers reduced their net long positions in Brent (-66 million barrels), NYMEX and ICE WTI (-37 million), U.S. gasoline (-15 million), U.S. heating oil (-6 million) and European gasoil (-9 million). The combined reduction in net long positions was the largest in any one week since the middle of July and before that the middle of February (tmsnrt.rs/2OD02A9). As a result, the ratio of bullish long positions to bearish short ones slipped below 8:1, down from a recent high of more than 12:1 at the end of September. While most of the adjustments came from the long side of the market, fund managers boosted short positions in NYMEX WTI by 16 million barrels. The one-week increase in NYMEX WTI short positions was the largest for 52 weeks and took the total number of short positions to its highest level since November 2017. Fund managers’ NYMEX WTI short positions have jumped by 35 million barrels over the last seven weeks, in what is starting to look like the start of the first new short-selling cycle for over a year. Lingering concern about the impact of U.S. sanctions on Iran’s exports and the availability of crude oil has helped to keep many fund managers long. But doubts about the state of the global economy and the outlook for oil consumption in 2019 are weighing on oil prices as well as equities. Saudi Arabia’s international position has weakened after journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed inside its consulate in Istanbul, leaving it reliant on goodwill of the United States. The prospect of diplomatic isolation makes it more likely Saudi Arabia will pump extra oil and try to keep prices lower than before to protect relations with the United States. Even before the Khashoggi crisis, the White House had made clear that it expects Saudi Arabia to pump more oil to compensate for the loss of exports from Iran and keep prices below $80 per barrel. Finally, with spot prices and calendar spreads coming under pressure, the incentive for fund managers to realise some profits after the previous rally has sharpened, and the liquidation has become self-fulfilling. From a positioning perspective, the hedge fund community’s stance now appears less lopsided than at the end of September. Some of the liquidation risk that was hanging over the market has been removed because it has already been realised. But fund managers are still fairly long of crude and refined products and the fundamental outlook appears more uncertain than before.

2018-10-22,"TOKYO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Japan’s trade ministry on Monday spelt out ways that buyers and sellers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) can rework supply contracts to remove restrictions on resale of cargoes which Japan last year said were anti-competitive. Japan’s anti-monopoly watchdog ruled in June last year that all new LNG contracts should not restrict resale of the fuel, marking a step towards liberalising the LNG market in Asia. But global LNG suppliers have been slow to revise their contracts for Japanese buyers. The trade ministry presented the so-called “model diversion clause” for supply contracts at an annual conference in Nagoya. The suggested language follows the lack of action on renegotiating contracts following the last year’ ruling. Buyers in Japan, the world’s biggest LNG importer, have long complained about the so-called destination clauses restricting resale. They want more leeway to resell spare cargoes but have been prevented by the clauses. The Japan Fair Trade Commission’s ruling last year found that the destination clauses, long-time features of LNG sales contracts that restrict buyers from selling cargoes to third parties, were anti-competitive. At the time it was thought that ruling would force the renegotiation of billions of dollars of existing LNG contracts. “No-one has struck out a destination clause on the basis of the ruling, as far as I’m aware,” one lawyer who has spent decades involved in LNG contract negotiations told Reuters at the conference. In new contracts, the clauses are rarely included, the LNG lawyer said. The trade ministry’s “model diversion clause” for LNG sale and purchases contracts spells out contractual arrangements for cargo diversions, including delivery specifications and profit sharing or compensation arrangements.

2018-10-22,"(Repeats item published earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Oct 22 (Reuters) - With China’s anti-pollution restrictions starting to take effect, one of the conventional market wisdoms is that this will boost demand for high-grade iron ore. The logic is sound: If steel mills are restricted as to how much they can pollute, they will use the best possible quality iron ore in order to maximise the amount of steel produced relative to the energy consumed. This means that ore with an iron content of 62 percent or higher should command a greater period during the winter restriction period than those poorer quality grades, such as 58 percent ore. It’s still not absolutely certain how much iron ore capacity will be idled, or forced to run at lower production rates, over the winter period as part of efforts to limit air pollution from burning coal. This time around Beijing has allowed local authorities to set their own anti-smog measures, changing from last winter’s policy of imposing blanket cuts on certain steel-producing regions. This had made it more difficult to work out precisely how much steel capacity may be cut and how many tonnes of production may be lost. Some steel-making areas, such as top producer Tangshan, appeared to have imposed less stringent measures, but have made them last for longer, this time to the end of March 2019 as opposed to the middle of March in this year’s curbs. Analysts at Barclays Bank said in a research note on Oct. 19 that the longer period will outweigh the more lenient capacity reductions, resulting in the loss of 19 million tonnes this winter from Tangshan compared to 11 million tonnes the previous winter. The output restrictions will also apply to more steel-making regions than last year, raising the possibility that steel output will decline over the winter period. This didn’t happen last winter, as mills in areas not subject to restrictions were able to increase output by more than the volume lost by plants subject to pollution controls. Whatever ends up being the case, the likelihood is that steel mills will seek to use higher-grade iron ore in order to produce the most amount of steel from whatever capacity they are allowed to use. This should boost demand for higher-quality iron ore, although this dynamic has yet to show up in pricing. Iron ore for China delivery with a 65-percent iron content MT-IO-QIN65=ARG, as assessed by Argus Media, ended last week at $97.15 a tonne, while 62-percent ore MT-IO-QIN62=ARG was $73.60 and low-grade 58-percent MT-IO-QIN58=ARG was $60.28. This put the 65-percent ore at a premium of 32 percent to 62-percent, and at a premium of 61 percent to the 58-percent grade. That may seem like quite substantial, but it’s not far off the 33.5 percent commanded by the 65-percent ire over the 62-percent at the end of October last year, and the 76.8 percent premium over 58-percent. Interestingly, last winter the premium didn’t actually widen over the season - it narrowed, with 65-percent ore ending February just 21.4 percent above 62-percent grade ore and 50 percent higher than 58-percent ore. That would seem to fly in the face of the market view that winter should lead to stronger demand for higher-grade ore, given that the last year the poorer quality grades actually closed the gap on the top-quality ore. However, the explanation is likely that steel mills outside the pollution control areas took advantage of the wide discount for low-grade ore at the start of winter and bought cargoes of the cheaper supplies. This winter the dynamics may end being slightly different, given the likely wider application of anti-pollution measures. Certainly, there is some evidence to suggest that higher-grades ores, such as those supplied by Brazil’s Vale , are seeing increasing demand. Vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Refinitiv suggests that China may import as much as 26.2 million tonnes from Brazil this month. That would be the strongest monthly result since the data series began in 2015. While this data is subject to revision, due to the timing of vessels arriving and discharging their cargoes, it still points to strong Chinese demand for higher-grade iron ore.

Siemens Gamesa, which is battling Denmark’s Vestas for dominance of the global wind turbine market, said it had been chosen as the preferred supplier for the project. This is usually the first step towards a firm contract. The assembly plant would be built near Taichung Harbor and be ready by 2021. The contract would involve 112 units of Siemens Gamesa’s direct drive 8 MW turbines. “Greater Changhua represents an extremely significant leap forward for (Siemens Gamesa) in Taiwan,” Andreas Nauen, who heads the group’s offshore unit, said in a statement. “It will enable us to establish a nacelle assembly facility in Taichung Harbor by 2021 upon Orsted’s request, and ahead of local content requirements as set by the Taiwanese government.” Boosted by a plan to phase out nuclear power by 2025, Taiwan has emerged as the most promising offshore wind turbine market outside of Europe, attracting project developers such as Orsted and Germany’s wpd as well as equipment makers. MHI Vestas, a joint venture of Vestas and Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and the world’s second-largest maker of offshore wind turbines, has been chosen as the preferred supplier for three Taiwanese projects with a combined capacity of 900 MW.

2018-10-22,"N’DJAMENA (Reuters) - Two of six critically endangered black rhinos relocated to Chad in May have died, Zakouma National Park’s management said, undermining efforts to restore their population in Chad after a nearly 50-year absence.  Before the transfer of the six rhinos from South Africa in May, the species had not been seen in Chad since 1972, mostly as a result of rampant poaching. Across their habitat in southern, eastern and central Africa, poaching drove the black rhinos to near extinction. Their numbers fell by 98 percent between 1960 and 1998, but have doubled since then to about 5,400 due to conservation efforts.  In a statement over the weekend, African Parks, a non-profit organisation that runs Zakouma, said the carcasses of one male and one female rhino were discovered in separate locations in the park on Oct. 15.  It said the rhinos were not poached but that the exact cause of death was not yet known. Gilles Desesquelles, an African Parks representative, said a virus could be to blame.   The relocation of the rhinos from South Africa was intended to safeguard the species by expanding its geographic distribution, restore Zakouma’s ecosystem and boost tourism to the 3,049 square-kilometre park.  Zakouma says it has mostly eliminated poaching since the end of a series of rebellions in Chad in 2009 and its famed elephant population — 95 percent of which was poached between 2002-2010 — is on the rise again.

2018-10-22,"(Repeats story with no change to headline or text) By Chris Prentice and Frank Jack Daniel NEW YORK/MEXICO CITY, Oct 22(Reuters) - The new North American trade agreement ends key legal protections for many U.S. businesses operating in Mexico, leaving their operations exposed to a risk they had avoided under the old trade deal: Mexico’s court system. For thousands of U.S. firms, the change could add complications and uncertainty to doing business south of the border. Mexico is the third-largest U.S. trading partner. The previous trade agreement, NAFTA, included provisions that gave U.S. firms operating in Mexico and Canada the option to challenge government decisions at an international tribunal. A change in Mexican or Canadian regulations, for example, that had a material impact on a U.S. firm’s operations, could be challenged through an international panel instead of local courts. The removal of the investment protection means firms would now be at the mercy of Mexico’s courts, which are notorious for corruption, an energy industry source said. The provision has been part of numerous trade pacts to lessen risks for firms operating overseas. Its removal makes the new agreement an outlier, trade experts and industry sources in Washington said. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump took a negative view on the provision. U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer sees it as a subsidy for U.S. companies to invest in Mexico. A spokeswoman for USTR declined to comment for this story, referring to Lighthizer’s previous statements, which essentially said the old provision encouraged companies to move operations overseas at the cost of American jobs. Trump blamed NAFTA for the loss of thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs to Mexico, where labor is cheaper. He threatened to end the free trade deal until Mexico and Canada agreed to more favorable terms. A revised pact was signed last month. A PHASE-OUT OF PROTECTIONS The new deal, officially called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), will phase out much of the old investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) protections over coming years. Lighthizer had initially wanted to remove all such protections, but agreed to some carve outs after pressure from Mexico and U.S. industry groups, Mexican sources said. “He took a more moderate position because Mexico wanted to preserve ISDS, because it is very important for investment,” said Jesus Seade, lead trade negotiator for Mexico President-elect Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador. Republican lawmakers in the United States, including Senator Orrin Hatch from Utah, also opposed Lighthizer’s attempts to cut ISDS from the deal. He led other lawmakers to press Lighthizer to keep NAFTA’s “robust investor protections” in a March letter. A spokeswoman for Hatch said he is still reviewing the deal and working to ensure it “will build on NAFTA’s proven success”. Under the new deal, the ISDS tribunal would only be an option for firms disputing a small number of issues, such as state expropriation of assets or discrimination against foreign entities. A handful of industries retain broader protections under USMCA. They are oil and gas, telecommunications, power generation and infrastructure sectors that have contracts with the Mexican government. But even those sectors face some uncertainty, industry sources said, because it is unclear if contracts with state-owned enterprises, such as oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) and state power utility Comision Federal Electricidad, would be covered. “This is a major degradation of investor protections,” a business industry source in Washington said. Large U.S. firms have typically won these kinds of disputes, sources said. In 2009, agribusiness Cargill Inc won $77 million from the arbitration tribunal over trade barriers the company said Mexico erected against high-fructose corn syrup from 2002 to 2007. In 2015, Ottawa was forced to pay ExxonMobil Corp and Murphy Oil Corp $17 million in damages after the companies won a victory against a requirement to spend money on research and development. “The change to ISDS is certainly deliberate and signals what USTR will pursue in the future,” said Inu Manak, a trade specialist at the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington. USTR last week said it plans to open trade talks with the European Union, the United Kingdom and Japan. “We’ll have to see how far they push it in the coming year as more negotiations begin,” Manak said.

2018-10-22,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian oil output cannot be replaced by other oil producing countries if Tehran is hit by U.S. sanctions in November, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh told the Ministry’s website SHANA on Monday . “As I have repeatedly said there is no replacement for Iranian oil in the market. Saudi Arabia and Russia’s output is near their highest level ever and they have no spare capacity to pump more to replace Iran’s oil,” he told SHANA.  In May, U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Iran and announced sanctions against OPEC’s third-largest producer Iran.  Washington is pushing allies to cut imports of Iranian oil to zero and will reimpose sanctions on Iranian oil and financial sectors in November.  It is also encouraging other oil producers such as Saudi Arabia, other OPEC members and Russia, to pump more to meet any shortfall. Iran’s regional rival, U.S.-ally Saudi Arabia says Riyadh has capacity to increase output to 12 million barrels per day (bpd) from the current 10.7 million bpd. OPEC agreed in June to boost supply to make up for the expected disruption to Iranian exports. But Iran has repeatedly said that its oil exports cannot be reduced to zero because of high demand levels in the market. Under sanctions, Iran’s oil exports could fall by as much as two-thirds, straining oil markets.  “The market’s knowledge of this inability has raised the prices as the average price (of crude) ... Rising oil prices have slowed down the economic growth of most of the consumer countries, which is affecting the global economy,” he said. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, in an interview with Reuters on Sunday, dismissed concerns that oil prices could rise, saying the market had already factored in the losses. Zanganeh advised Trump “to forgo imposition of sanctions on Iran’s oil exports”, saying that the non-OPEC producers of oil were also unable “to offset disruptions in the market”.  Iran has warned that if it cannot sell its oil due to U.S. pressure, then no other regional country will be allowed to do so either, threatening to block the Strait of Hormuz. Under the 2015 nuclear deal, most international sanctions against Tehran were lifted in 2016 in exchange for Iran curbing its nuclear programme.

2018-10-22,"* Italy relief lifts European stocks * China stocks enjoy best day in three years * Market awaiting rush of U.S. earnings reports * Sterling slips before British PM May’s speech (Updates prices throughout; adds economist comment) By Karin Strohecker and Tom Wilson LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - European shares crept higher on Monday on relief over Italy’s budget, tracking rallies in Asia markets after China promised to provide stimulus to stabilise its economy and offset the impact of U.S. tariffs. Promises of tax cuts and coordinated official statements of support for stock markets in the world’s second-largest economy saw Chinese shares stage their biggest one-day surge in three years. Shanghai blue chips jumped around 4.3 percent, adding to Friday’s bounce on Beijing’s pledge of support for the economy and companies. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.4 percent. Markets elsewhere in Asia also enjoyed healthy gains. . European stocks climbed 0.2 percent after Moody’s kept Italy’s sovereign rating stable on Friday instead of cutting it to negative. The decision fuelled a rally in Italian government bonds and boosted shares in the country’s banks. The Moody’s report and China’s verbal support for its economy helped markets look beyond worries over the impact on global growth from policy tightening by the Federal reserve and the U.S.-China trade war, market participants said. “It looks like the Chinese authorities will do what they can to stem the negative effects of those factors,” said Investec economist Victoria Clarke. The mood was set to travel to U.S. markets, where E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were 0.1 percent higher. Nasdaq’s added 0.4 percent. This week is the peak period of the U.S. earnings season, with Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Caterpillar among the companies reporting. Helped by a strong economy and deep corporate tax cuts, S&P 500 earnings per share are expected to grow 22 percent in the third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. “The season on an absolute basis will likely wind up being ‘strong’ and the vast majority of companies will exceed consensus expectations,” said analysts at JPMorgan in a note. “However, headwinds are building at the margin in the form of U.S. dollar strength, supply chain disruptions owing to all the trade uncertainty, and rising costs. Even the mere hint of a turn in profit fundamentals would have severe ramifications.” The outlook for global growth in 2019 has dimmed for the first time, according to Reuters polls of economists, who cautioned that the U.S.-China trade war and tightening financial conditions would trigger the next downturn. On currency markets, the euro rallied after the Moody’s report before pairing gains. By late morning it was down 0.1 percent at $1.15. The single currency has benefited from comments by Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, who reiterated the country does not intend to leave the euro. Bond yields dropped across the curve, with 10-year yields enjoying their biggest one-day drop since the June. But later in the day, Italy must explain to the European Commission its breach of rules. It faces the rejection of its budget, a move that could lead to sanctions. The government expects the commission to decide on Tuesday to ask a member state to revise its draft budget, for the first time ever, a government source said on Sunday. Italy is also expected to be on the agenda when the European Central Bank meets on Thursday. The bank is considered certain to keep policy on hold and is likely to put off discussion about its reinvestment policy until December. The dollar was up 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies at 95.796 Sterling, meanwhile, slipped 0.4 percent to $1.3022 as Brexit worries rose ahead of a speech to Britain’s parliament by Prime Minister Theresa May. Though May will tell parliament that 95 percent of Britain’s divorce deal has been agreed, she will repeat her opposition to the European Union’s proposal for the land border with Northern Ireland.. The border issue scuppered efforts to reach a Brexit deal at last week’s EU summit, and many see the risk of a challenge to her leadership being mounted. Saudi Arabia also remained in the spotlight after Riyadh called the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi a “huge and grave mistake” but sought to shield its powerful crown prince from the crisis. U.S. President Donald Trump and European leaders are pushing Saudi Arabia for more answers.

Several U.S. lawmakers have suggested imposing sanctions on Saudi Arabia in recent days while the kingdom, the world’s largest oil exporter, has pledged to retaliate against any sanctions with “bigger measures”. “This incident will pass. But Saudi Arabia is a very responsible country, for decades we used our oil policy as a responsible economic tool and isolated it from politics,” Falih said. “My role as the energy minister is to implement my government’s constructive and responsible role and stabilizing the world’s energy markets accordingly, contributing to global economic development,” Falih said. He said that if oil prices went up, it would slow the global economy and trigger a recession.  In a column published last week, Saudi-owned Al Arabiya channel’s General Manager Turki Aldakhil warned that imposing sanctions on Riyadh could spark global economic disaster as oil could jump to $200 per barrel. The 1973 oil crisis began when Arab producers led by Saudi Arabia slapped an oil embargo on Western supporters of Israel in its war with Egypt, targeting Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, Britain and the United States. Oil prices spiked on the move, as they did later in 1979 because of the Iranian revolution.  The efficiency of the embargo was far from obvious as higher prices led to the development of new oil provinces outside the Middle East and encouraged alternative energy. Riyadh has refrained from using oil as a direct weapon since then. “If oil prices will go too high, it will slow down the world economy and would trigger a global recession. And Saudi Arabia has been consistent in its policy. We work to stabilize global markets and facilitate global economic growth. That policy has been consistent for many years,” Falih said. More: tass.com/economy/1026924 Falih said that with sanctions on Iran coming into full force next month, there was no guarantee oil prices would refrain from going higher. “I cannot give you a guarantee, because I cannot predict what will happen to other suppliers,” Falih said, when asked whether the world can avoid oil hitting $100 per barrel again. “We have sanctions on Iran, and nobody has a clue what Iranians’ exports will be. Secondly, there are potential declines in different countries like Libya, Nigeria, Mexico and Venezuela,” he said. “If 3 million barrels per day disappears, we cannot cover this volume. So we have to use oil reserves,” he said. Falih said Saudi Arabia would soon raise output to 11 million barrels per day (bpd) from the current 10.7 million. He added that Riyadh had capacity to increase output to 12 million bpd and its Gulf OPEC ally, the United Arab Emirates, could add another 0.2 million bpd. “We have relatively limited spare capacities and we are using a significant part of them,” he said. Global supply next year could be helped by Brazil, Kazakhstan and the United States, he added. “But if you have other countries to decline in addition to the full application of Iran sanctions, then we will be pulling all spare capacities,” Falih said.

2018-10-22,"(Removes superfluous letter from headline.) * China stocks enjoying best day in three years * Italy relief lifts European stocks, euro * Market awaiting rush of U.S. earnings reports * Saudi Arabia, Italy, Brexit keep geopolitics in focus By Karin Strohecker LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - European shares gained on Monday amid relief over Italy’s budget, following rallies in Asia after China promised to provide stimulus to stabilise its economy and offset the impact of U.S. tariffs. Promises of tax cuts and coordinated official statements of support for stock markets in the world’s second-largest economy saw Chinese shares stage their biggest one-day surge in three years. Shanghai blue chips jumped around 4.5 percent, adding to Friday’s bounce on Beijing’s pledge of support for the economy and companies. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.4 percent. Markets elsewhere in Asia also enjoyed healthy gains. . European stocks opened higher after Moody’s kept Italy’s sovereign rating stable on Friday instead of cutting it to negative. The decision fuelled a rally in Italian government bonds and boosted shares in the country’s banks. “Moody’s opens the door for a euro bounce, while Chinese verbal support for the economy and markets has given us a risk-friendly mood to start the week,” Societe Generale said in a note to clients. The mood looked to spill over into U.S. markets, where E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were 0.4 percent higher while Nasdaq’s added 0.7 percent. This week is the peak period of the U.S. earnings season, with Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Caterpillar among the companies reporting. Helped by a strong economy and deep corporate tax cuts, S&P 500 earnings per share are expected to grow 22 percent in the third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. “The season on an absolute basis will likely wind up being ‘strong’ and the vast majority of companies will exceed consensus expectations,” said analysts at JPMorgan in a note. “However, headwinds are building at the margin in the form of U.S. dollar strength, supply chain disruptions owing to all the trade uncertainty, and rising costs. Even the mere hint of a turn in profit fundamentals would have severe ramifications.” The outlook for global growth in 2019 has dimmed for the first time, according to Reuters polls of economists, who cautioned that the U.S.-China trade war and tightening financial conditions would trigger the next downturn. On currency markets, the euro sailed higher against the dollar after the Moody’s report. It also benefited from comments by Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, who reiterated the country does not intend to leave the single currency. Bond yields dropped across the curve, with 10-year yields enjoying their biggest one-day drop since the June. But later in the day, Italy must explain to the European Commission its breach of rules. It faces the rejection of its budget, possibly leading to sanctions. The government expects the commission to decide on Tuesday to ask a member state to revise its draft budget, for the first time ever, a government source said on Sunday. Italy is also expected to be on the agenda when the European Central Bank meets on Thursday. The bank is considered certain to keep policy on hold and is likely to put off discussion about its reinvestment policy until December. The dollar weakened 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies at 95.578 while sterling idled at $1.3081 as the market waited for more developments on Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May will tell parliament that 95 percent of Britain’s divorce deal has now been settled. But she will repeat her opposition to the EU’s proposal for the land border with Northern Ireland and many see the risk of a leadership challenge being mounted. Saudi Arabia also remained in the spotlight after Riyadh called the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi a “huge and grave mistake” but sought to shield its powerful crown prince from the crisis  . U.S. President Donald Trump and European leaders are pushing Saudi Arabia for more answers. In commodity markets, Brent crude futures climbed past op $80 per barrel, with U.S. sanctions against Iran’s crude exports due to be implemented next month.

2018-10-22,"NAGOYA, Japan, Oct 22 (Reuters) - LNG Canada challenged competing U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG)  projects on Monday, saying many could end up “dead in the water” as long as China keeps its tariff on U.S. imports of the fuel as part of the trade war between the countries. China in September announced a 10 percent tariff on U.S. LNG imports as part of an escalating trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. This month, Royal Dutch Shell said it received a final investment decision (FID) for its $31 billion LNG Canada project, which is expected to start exporting in 2025. Speaking at an industry event in Nagoya on Monday, LNG Canada Chief Executive Andy Calitz said the FID “was irrespective” of Chinese tariffs on U.S. LNG, but added such measures would make U.S. LNG less competitive. “The world has become so competitive that if we are to face a 10 percent surcharge tariff on LNG, then as far as I’m concerned, you’re dead in the water. So I’m very happy to be in Canada,” he told Reuters. Current U.S. LNG exports remain competitive despite the 10 percent surcharge into China, as U.S. natural gas is cheap thanks to booming shale output, allowing exporters to offer LNG at competitive rates. Once operational, LNG Canada will have the advantage of being closer to Asia’s North Asian consumer hubs than U.S. facilities, saving freight costs, while also avoiding fees for using the Panama Canal that current U.S. LNG exporters must pay since they are located on the Gulf of Mexico. Several U.S. projects are still vying for financing and they must compete with rising output elsewhere, including from top producers Australia and Qatar. Being competitive in China is key as it is the world’s fastest growing LNG import market. Calitz said China would overtake Japan as the world’s biggest LNG importer “within the next 24 months.” China’s natural gas consumption in 2017 rose 14.8 percent from the previous year to 238.6 billion cubic meters, and is expected to reach 270 billion cubic meters in 2018 and 320 billion cubic meters in 2020, Guo Zhi, general economist at China’s National Energy Administration, said at the event.

2018-10-22,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgium’s energy production is plunging as its nuclear reactors are taken offline for repairs, with the power shortfall this winter seen as a test of the country’s ability to cope when the reactors are phased out from 2022. Four nuclear reactors at Doel near Antwerp and three at Tihange in Liege, all operated by Electrabel, part of France’s Engie (ENGIE.PA), produce about half of Belgium’s electricity when they are fully operational.  Six of the seven — all built between 1975 and 1985 with an original lifespan of 40 years — are currently closed for repairs and maintenance, reducing their combined 6 gigawatts (GW) capacity by nearly two-thirds. They are expected to come back online between late November and June. Grid operator Elia (ELI.BR) has warned it may have to ration electricity during the high-demand winter months, while fears of a supply shortage that could see lights go out and trains stand still have pushed power prices to record highs.  The Doel 1 and 2 reactors were shut down in the spring for repairs to their water-cooling systems, while Tihange 1 went offline on Oct. 13 for refuelling and regular maintenance. Tihange 2 and 3 and Doel 4 are closed while concrete degradation in bunkers close to the reactor buildings is investigated and repaired. Similar concerns led to a shutdown last year at Doel 3, the only reactor scheduled to remain online through November. Engie built a new roof for the bunker at Doel 3 and will do the same at the other reactors with concrete degradation, deputy director general Pierre Mongin told a briefing on Thursday. Belgium’s nuclear regulator FANC has said problems in the concrete structures surrounding the four reactors are classed as the lowest level of severity, with no impact on the population or the environment.     This year, Belgium extended the area within which it distributes free iodine tablets for use in a nuclear emergency to all its territory and parts of Germany and the Netherlands, although it said there was no specific risk from the reactors. John Large, an independent nuclear engineer and analyst, said fixing the concrete degradations could take months longer than Electrabel has projected. Based on the problems at the other reactors, he said the year-end finish targeted for the repairs at Doel was optimistic, adding: “I would expect them to go into, very certainly into the mid of next year before they can come back online.” Electrabel spokeswoman Anne-Sophie Huge told Reuters the dates given for restarting the reactors — which will need permission from FANC — were its best estimate given the information it has.  Elia estimates it will need about 1,700 megawatts (MW) of additional capacity for the winter because of the outages, of which 700-900 MW has yet to be found.  To help make up the loss, Engie has fired up old gas plants and brought in diesel generators, as well as paying heavy industrial consumers to curb their use, Mongin said.     Grilled by lawmakers this month, Engie Electrabel’s chief nuclear officer Thierry Saegeman said it would work with Elia to find power but that its first priority was safety. If shortfalls persist, an eight-stage load-shedding plan devised by Elia could see daily power cuts in rural areas, Danielle Devogelaer of the Federal Planning Bureau told the hearing. Trains could not operate beyond the first stage of load-shedding, Thomas Baeken, spokesman for rail operator Infrabel, told Reuters — halting passengers and freight within Belgium, a major transport hub for goods coming from Asia to Europe. Energy minister Marie Christine Marghem said imported power would help avoid blackouts. “The month of November, which was critical, is now a lot more secure. For the rest of winter we will continue working,” she told Reuters. A deal to free up capacity on Belgian interconnectors, through which much renewable electricity produced in northern Germany reaches southern Germany, will allow more imports. Elia CEO Chris Peeters told lawmakers that France would supply 1,000 MW in November and December. Belgium’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from overseas are at high levels, with six tankers due to arrive within days. [LNG/TKUK] But Peeters was “less positive” about January and February, especially if a cold winter limits the energy neighbouring countries can export.   France, for example, has issues with energy availability in winter due to safety concerns at its own nuclear reactors. Many European reactors are reaching the end of their lives and showing defects that ultimately cannot be fixed.  The struggle to meet energy demand this winter has raised questions about how Belgium will cope after its nuclear reactors are decommissioned.  A law passed in 2003 extended the lifetime of the oldest reactors to 2025, with phasing out due to start in 2022. Energy expert Devogelaer told Reuters Belgium is likely to rely on natural gas, while an Elia spokeswoman said it expects to make up the loss from nuclear with gas and renewables such as solar and wind, plus higher imports.  The grid operator said in 2017 that at least 3.6 GW of new build adjustable (thermal) capacity would be needed to “cope with the shock of the nuclear exit”. Belgium has an LNG terminal and by 2020 will have interconnectors with France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Britain and Germany. But it has yet to begin building new gas-fired power plants. “It would require the construction of between six to eight gas-fired generators in Belgium to replace the nuclear capacity,” said Pierre Georges, lead EMEA utilities analyst at S&P Global.  “The problem is that as of today, no one is willing to build a gas power plant without a market design that would make them profitable.” A Belgian government plan to subsidise investment in gas plants is being reviewed to ensure it meets European Union competition rules, Marghem said. But the clock is ticking. “Time is up now, so if we have learned anything from this situation, it is that we should not linger on, we should really go ahead with the construction,” Devogelaer told Reuters.

2018-10-22,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. refiners are expected to post strong earnings for the third quarter, with Midwest producers leading the way thanks to cheaper prices for Canadian crude that pushed down input costs. Independent refiners benefited from a steep discount for U.S. crude oil below the price of global benchmark Brent. WTCLc1-LCOc1 A further discount on oil out of Midland, Texas, may have also helped, though that discount declined in the most recent quarter. Because of transportation constraints, Canada’s oil has a steeper discount than U.S. crude, and analysts believe this should benefit refiners situated in the Midwest that process a higher volume of that country’s crude than those on the Gulf Coast.  “Until you see adequate relief up in west Canada, we think the number one region for refining economics in the U.S. will continue to be the U.S. midcontinent,” said Zachary Rogers, a refining and oil markets research analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Canadian crude is currently priced at almost $50 less than U.S. crude, an all-time record. During the third quarter it was as low as $43.50 per barrel less than WTI, according to Shorcan Energy brokers SHRWCSMc2.  Canadian producers have been forced to sell crude at a discount as production has outpaced pipeline capacity. (Graphic: Canadian crude prices fall to lowest on record - tmsnrt.rs/2J6n1gV) Top importers of Canadian crude to Midwest refineries include Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N), Flint Hills Resources and BP Plc (BP.L), EIA data showed. Marathon currently ranks in the 98th percentile in Refinitiv Eikon’s analyst revisions model for North American stocks, due to strong trends in forward earnings estimates and recommendations. Canadian crude oil imports to the Midwest totaled almost 74.6 million barrels in July, the most on record for that month, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data.  (For a graphic on top Canadian crude importers in the Midwest, see: tmsnrt.rs/2P2TiLl) Refiners on the East Coast and Gulf Coast are also expected to post strong results, Rogers said. Most refiners benefited from sharp declines in the Midland grade, which in August hit its widest discount to U.S. crude in six years. WTC-WTM. Since then, however, that Midland differential has narrowed, and margins for gasoline, known as the crack spread, RBc1-CLc1 have since declined. That tempered some analysts’ projections for third-quarter earnings.  “I don’t think our outlook for refiners is as strong as it would have been 30 days ago,” said Nick Holmes, an investment analyst at Tortoise Capital. Refiners with exposure to the differential, such as Delek US Holdings Inc (DK.N), may see less of a benefit, Holmes said. Since Oct. 8, nine analysts have lowered expectations for Delek’s third-quarter earnings per share, while just two have raised estimates, according to Eikon.  Heading into the fourth quarter, markets for diesel and heating oil will carry the industry at a time when supply for the products are at seasonal four-year lows, EIA data showed. During the current quarter, the 3:2:1 crack spread CL321-1=R, an indicator of refiner profits, has been trading around its highest seasonal level since 2012, although it was even higher last year. Heating oil prices this winter are projected to be at their strongest since 2014, said Greg Gmoser, associate director in the refining and marketing group at IHS Markit. “Our analysis points to the system teetering on the edge of some substantial price spikes,” said Rogers of Wood Mackenzie.

2018-10-22,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - With China’s anti-pollution restrictions starting to take effect, one of the conventional market wisdoms is that this will boost demand for high-grade iron ore. The logic is sound: If steel mills are restricted as to how much they can pollute, they will use the best possible quality iron ore in order to maximise the amount of steel produced relative to the energy consumed. This means that ore with an iron content of 62 percent or higher should command a greater period during the winter restriction period than those poorer quality grades, such as 58 percent ore. It’s still not absolutely certain how much iron ore capacity will be idled, or forced to run at lower production rates, over the winter period as part of efforts to limit air pollution from burning coal. This time around Beijing has allowed local authorities to set their own anti-smog measures, changing from last winter’s policy of imposing blanket cuts on certain steel-producing regions. This had made it more difficult to work out precisely how much steel capacity may be cut and how many tonnes of production may be lost. Some steel-making areas, such as top producer Tangshan, appeared to have imposed less stringent measures, but have made them last for longer, this time to the end of March 2019 as opposed to the middle of March in this year’s curbs. Analysts at Barclays Bank said in a research note on Oct. 19 that the longer period will outweigh the more lenient capacity reductions, resulting in the loss of 19 million tonnes this winter from Tangshan compared to 11 million tonnes the previous winter. The output restrictions will also apply to more steel-making regions than last year, raising the possibility that steel output will decline over the winter period. This didn’t happen last winter, as mills in areas not subject to restrictions were able to increase output by more than the volume lost by plants subject to pollution controls. Whatever ends up being the case, the likelihood is that steel mills will seek to use higher-grade iron ore in order to produce the most amount of steel from whatever capacity they are allowed to use. This should boost demand for higher-quality iron ore, although this dynamic has yet to show up in pricing. Iron ore for China delivery with a 65-percent iron content, as assessed by Argus Media, ended last week at $97.15 a tonne, while 62-percent ore was $73.60 and low-grade 58-percent was $60.28. This put the 65-percent ore at a premium of 32 percent to 62-percent, and at a premium of 61 percent to the 58-percent grade. That may seem like quite substantial, but it’s not far off the 33.5 percent commanded by the 65-percent ire over the 62-percent at the end of October last year, and the 76.8 percent premium over 58-percent. Interestingly, last winter the premium didn’t actually widen over the season - it narrowed, with 65-percent ore ending February just 21.4 percent above 62-percent grade ore and 50 percent higher than 58-percent ore. That would seem to fly in the face of the market view that winter should lead to stronger demand for higher-grade ore, given that the last year the poorer quality grades actually closed the gap on the top-quality ore. However, the explanation is likely that steel mills outside the pollution control areas took advantage of the wide discount for low-grade ore at the start of winter and bought cargoes of the cheaper supplies. This winter the dynamics may end being slightly different, given the likely wider application of anti-pollution measures. Certainly, there is some evidence to suggest that higher-grades ores, such as those supplied by Brazil’s Vale, are seeing increasing demand. Vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Refinitiv suggests that China may import as much as 26.2 million tonnes from Brazil this month. That would be the strongest monthly result since the data series began in 2015. While this data is subject to revision, due to the timing of vessels arriving and discharging their cargoes, it still points to strong Chinese demand for higher-grade iron ore.

2018-10-22,"NEW YORK/MEXICO CITY(Reuters) - The new North American trade agreement ends key legal protections for many U.S. businesses operating in Mexico, leaving their operations exposed to a risk they had avoided under the old trade deal: Mexico’s court system. For thousands of U.S. firms, the change could add complications and uncertainty to doing business south of the border. Mexico is the third-largest U.S. trading partner. The previous trade agreement, NAFTA, included provisions that gave U.S. firms operating in Mexico and Canada the option to challenge government decisions at an international tribunal. A change in Mexican or Canadian regulations, for example, that had a material impact on a U.S. firm’s operations, could be challenged through an international panel instead of local courts. The removal of the investment protection means firms would now be at the mercy of Mexico’s courts, which are notorious for corruption, an energy industry source said. The provision has been part of numerous trade pacts to lessen risks for firms operating overseas. Its removal makes the new agreement an outlier, trade experts and industry sources in Washington said. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump took a negative view on the provision. U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer sees it as a subsidy for U.S. companies to invest in Mexico. A spokeswoman for USTR declined to comment for this story, referring to Lighthizer’s previous statements, which essentially said the old provision encouraged companies to move operations overseas at the cost of American jobs. Trump blamed NAFTA for the loss of thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs to Mexico, where labor is cheaper. He threatened to end the free trade deal until Mexico and Canada agreed to more favorable terms. A revised pact was signed last month. A PHASE-OUT OF PROTECTIONS The new deal, officially called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), will phase out much of the old investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) protections over coming years.  Lighthizer had initially wanted to remove all such protections, but agreed to some carve outs after pressure from Mexico and U.S. industry groups, Mexican sources said. “He took a more moderate position because Mexico wanted to preserve ISDS, because it is very important for investment,” said Jesus Seade, lead trade negotiator for Mexico President-elect Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador. Republican lawmakers in the United States, including Senator Orrin Hatch from Utah, also opposed Lighthizer’s attempts to cut ISDS from the deal. He led other lawmakers to press Lighthizer to keep NAFTA’s “robust investor protections” in a March letter.  A spokeswoman for Hatch said he is still reviewing the deal and working to ensure it “will build on NAFTA’s proven success”. Under the new deal, the ISDS tribunal would only be an option for firms disputing a small number of issues, such as state expropriation of assets or discrimination against foreign entities. A handful of industries retain broader protections under USMCA. They are oil and gas, telecommunications, power generation and infrastructure sectors that have contracts with the Mexican government. But even those sectors face some uncertainty, industry sources said, because it is unclear if contracts with state-owned enterprises, such as oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) and state power utility Comision Federal Electricidad, would be covered. “This is a major degradation of investor protections,” a business industry source in Washington said. Large U.S. firms have typically won these kinds of disputes, sources said. In 2009, agribusiness Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] won $77 million from the arbitration tribunal over trade barriers the company said Mexico erected against high-fructose corn syrup from 2002 to 2007. In 2015, Ottawa was forced to pay ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N) and Murphy Oil Corp (MUR.N) $17 million in damages after the companies won a victory against a requirement to spend money on research and development. “The change to ISDS is certainly deliberate and signals what USTR will pursue in the future,” said Inu Manak, a trade specialist at the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington.  USTR last week said it plans to open trade talks with the European Union, the United Kingdom and Japan. “We’ll have to see how far they push it in the coming year as more negotiations begin,” Manak said.

2018-10-22,"* Appeal to all producers, consumers for “common sense” -Birol * Doesn’t expect Saudi cuts, but sees significant market worries (Adds comment, detail) By Osamu Tsukimori and Aaron Sheldrick NAGOYA, Japan, Oct 22 (Reuters) - International Energy Agency (IEA) chief Fatih Birol said on Monday he is not worried Saudi Arabia will cut oil supply in response to any potential sanctions over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but urged common sense as political developments may impact energy markets. “There are many geopolitical, non-energy related issues, which could also have further impact on the oil markets,” Birol told Reuters, when asked about concerns in oil markets over whether Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest crude oil exporter, might retaliate against any punitive measures by global powers over Khashoggi’s death in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. “There’s a strong challenge for the key producers to increase production and comfort the markets. I appeal to all the producers and consumers to have common sense in the very difficult months we are entering,” Birol said, speaking on the sidelines of an LNG conference in Nagoya, Japan. He said he did not think that Saudi Arabia would cut production, but he has “significant worries” about the market because of falling supply from Venezuela and Iran amid strong demand growth. Amid that supply-demand equation, Birol said, “There is potential we will see even higher prices than current ones and it comes, as it always does, at a bad time for the global economy.” Saudi Arabia on Sunday called the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at its Istanbul consulate a “huge and grave mistake,” but sought to shield its powerful crown prince from the widening crisis, saying Mohammed bin Salman had not been aware. The comments from Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir were some of the most direct yet from Riyadh, which has given multiple and conflicting accounts about Khashoggi’s killing on Oct. 2, first denying his death and later admitting it amid an international outcry.

Blue chips in Shanghai climbed 3.5 percent in early trade there, extending Friday’s bounce on Beijing’s pledge of support for the economy and companies. That helped E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 halve their initial loss to be down 0.25 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan turned around to edge up 0.2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei was off 0.2 percent, after being down over 1 percent earlier, as were South Korean stocks. This week is the peak period of the U.S. earnings season and companies reporting include Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Caterpillar. Helped by a strong economy and deep corporate tax cuts, S&P 500 earnings per share are expected to grow 22 percent in the third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. “The season on an absolute basis will likely wind up being ‘strong’ and the vast majority of companies will exceed consensus expectations,” said analysts at JPMorgan in a note. “However, headwinds are building at the margin in the form of U.S. dollar strength, supply chain disruptions owing to all the trade uncertainty, and rising costs. Even the mere hint of a turn in profit fundamentals would have severe ramifications.” The outlook for global growth in 2019 has dimmed for the first time, according to Reuters polls of economists who cautioned that the U.S.-China trade war and tightening financial conditions would trigger the next downturn. Saudi Arabia remained in the spotlight as Riyadh on Sunday called the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi a “huge and grave mistake,” but sought to shield its powerful crown prince from the widening crisis. On Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump joined European leaders in pushing Saudi Arabia for more answers after Riyadh acknowledged that the journalist died at the consulate following weeks of denial. In Europe, Italy has until Monday to explain to the Commission its breach of rules and faces the rejection of its budget, which may eventually lead to sanctions. The Italian government expects the European Commission to decide for the first time ever on Tuesday to ask a member state to revise its draft budget, a government source said on Sunday. Italian bond yields hit their highest level since early 2014 on Friday and the premium investors demand in comparison to German debt is at a five and a half year high. Italy is expected to be on the agenda when the European Central Bank meets on Thursday. The bank is considered certain to keep policy on hold and likely put off discussion about its reinvestment policy until December. The euro started the week steady at $1.1511 having bounced from support at $1.1431 on Friday. The dollar recovered form an early dip on the yen to stand at 112.55 and it was little changed against a basket of currencies at 95.704 . Sterling idled at $1.3063 as the market waited for more developments on Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May will tell parliament on Monday that 95 percent of Britain’s divorce deal has now been settled but will repeat her opposition to the European Union’s proposal for the land border with Northern Ireland. In commodity markets, gold held steady at $1,227.33 an ounce . Oil prices were stable on Monday, supported by supply concerns ahead of the start of U.S. sanctions against Iran’s crude exports, but held back by rising drilling activity in the United States. Brent crude added 10 cents to $79.88 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose 12 cents to $69.24.

2018-10-22,"* Foreign Minister says prince was not aware * Calls killing a ‘grave mistake’ * European governments demand Riyadh provide facts about killing * Riyadh has given conflicting accounts of Khashoggi’s death (Adds Trump call with Macron, paragraph 15) By Doina Chiacu and Kylie MacLellan WASHINGTON/LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia on Sunday called the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at its Istanbul consulate a “huge and grave mistake,” but sought to shield its powerful crown prince from the widening crisis, saying Mohammed bin Salman had not been aware. The comments from Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir were some of the most direct yet from Riyadh, which has given multiple and conflicting accounts about Khashoggi’s killing on Oct. 2, first denying his death and later admitting it amid an international outcry. “This was an operation that was a rogue operation. This was an operation where individuals ended up exceeding the authorities and responsibilities they had,” Jubeir said on the U.S. broadcaster Fox. “They made the mistake when they killed Jamal Khashoggi in the consulate and they tried to cover up for it,” he said. The weeks of denial and lack of credible evidence in the face of allegations from Turkish officials that Khashoggi had been killed have shaken global confidence in ties with the world’s top oil exporter. U.S. Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin said Saudi Arabia’s admission that the Washington Post columnist was killed in a fistfight was a “good first step but not enough,” though he added it was premature to discuss sanctions against Riyadh. Three European powers - Germany, Britain and France - pressed Riyadh to provide facts, and Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany would not export arms to Saudi Arabia while uncertainty over Khashoggi’s fate persisted. Late on Sunday, the Saudi Press Agency said both Saudi King Salman and Prince Mohammed had called Khashoggi’s son, Salah, to express condolences. Jubeir had extended condolences to Khashoggi’s family earlier on Sunday. “Unfortunately, a huge and grave mistake was made and I assure them that those responsible will be held accountable for this,” he told Fox. Jubeir said the Saudis did not know how Khashoggi, a Saudi national and U.S. resident, had been killed or where his body was. He also said Prince Mohammed was not responsible. Khashoggi vanished after entering the consulate to obtain documents for his upcoming marriage. After two weeks denying any involvement in the 59-year-old’s disappearance, Saudi Arabia on Saturday said Khashoggi, a critic of the crown prince, died during a fight in the building. An hour later, another Saudi official attributed the death to a chokehold. “Nothing can justify this killing and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms,” Germany, Britain and France said in their joint statement. “There remains an urgent need for clarification of exactly what happened ... beyond the hypotheses that have been raised so far in the Saudi investigation, which need to be backed by facts to be considered credible.” The White House said late on Sunday that U.S. President Donald Trump had spoken to French President Emmanuel Macron and the two had discussed a range of issues including circumstances surrounding Khashoggi’s death. Reflecting international scepticism over its account, a senior Saudi government official laid out a new version that contradicts previous explanations. The latest account includes details on how 15 Saudis sent to confront Khashoggi had threatened him with being drugged and kidnapped and killed him in a chokehold when he resisted. A member of the team dressed in Khashoggi’s clothes to make it appear as if he had left the consulate. Turkish officials suspect Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate by the Saudi agents and his body cut up. Turkish sources say authorities have an audio recording purportedly documenting Khashoggi’s murder. In a speech on Sunday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan appeared to suggest he was getting ready to release some information about the Turkish investigation, and would do so at his weekly speech on Tuesday to members of his ruling AK Party. Erdogan has remained largely silent on the case, although Turkey’s pro-government newspapers have released information about events at the consulate. Turkey’s Anadolu agency said early on Monday that Erdogan and Trump had spoken on the telephone and agreed that “all aspects” of the case needed to be cleared up. For Saudi Arabia’s allies - particularly in the West - the question will be whether they believe that the prince, who has painted himself as a reformer, has any culpability. King Salman, 82, has handed the day-to-day running of Saudi Arabia to him. “I am not satisfied until we find the answer. But it was a big first step, it was a good first step. But I want to get to the answer,” Trump told reporters this weekend, when asked about the Saudi investigation and Riyadh’s firing of officials. In an interview with the Washington Post, Trump said that “obviously there’s been deception, and there’s been lies.” He had suggested last week that “rogue killers” might have been responsible for Khashoggi’s death, a comment critics called an effort to play down the crisis. A leading Republican U.S. senator said he believed the crown prince was behind the killing, adding that the Saudis had lost credibility in their explanations of his death. “Yes, I think he did it,” Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN, referring to the crown prince. King Salman ordered the dismissal of five officials, including Saud al-Qahtani, a royal court adviser seen as the right-hand man to Prince Mohammed, and deputy intelligence chief Ahmed Asiri, Saudi state media reported on Saturday. The king also ordered a restructuring of the intelligence service, to be led by Prince Mohammed, suggesting the prince still retained wide-ranging authority. Some governments and prominent executives have said they would pull out of a forthcoming investment conference in Saudi Arabia. According to the senior Saudi official, the Saudi team rolled up Khashoggi’s body in a rug, took it out in a consular vehicle and handed it to a “local cooperator” for disposal.

2018-10-22,"* Sanctions against Iran oil exports to start Nov. 4 * U.S. rig count at highest since 2015: tmsnrt.rs/2PfF6i3 * U.S.-China trade war clouds 2019 outlook By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Oil prices were stable on Monday, supported by supply concerns ahead of the start of U.S. sanctions against Iran’s crude exports, but held back by rising drilling activity in the United States. Front-month Brent crude oil futures were trading at $79.74 a barrel at 0042 GMT, 4 cents below their last close at the end of last week. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $69.07 a barrel, 5 cents below their last settlement. U.S. sanctions against Iran’s oil exports will start on November 4. While the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed in June to boost supply to make up for expected Iran disruptions, an internal document reviewed by Reuters suggested that OPEC is struggling to add barrels to the market as an increase in Saudi Arabian supply was offset by declines in Iran, Venezuela and Angola. Traders said major oil consumers were stockpiling in anticipation of more disruptions. “In China, higher seasonal demand and suspected stockpiling are occurring, while similarly the U.S. and the OECD continue building stockpiles ahead of potential supply disruptions this winter,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore. Despite this, Innes said overall global oil supply was currently enough to meet demand. “While the supply-demand equilibrium remains fragile ... Brent remains in good short-term supply despite growing uncertainty about supply disruptions,” he said. There were also some signs of rising output, especially in North America. U.S. drillers added four oil rigs in the week to Oct. 19, bringing the total count to 873, Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday, raising the rig count to the highest level since March 2015. RIG-OL-USA-BHI The U.S. rig count is an early indicator of future output. With activity rising again after months of stagnation, U.S. crude production is also expected to continue to rise. Looking further out, concern that the trade dispute between the United States and China would crimp economic growth may weigh on the outlook for oil prices. “The full impact of the U.S.-China trade war will hit markets in 2019 and could act as a considerable drag on oil demand next year, raising the possibility of the market returning to surplus,” said Emirates NBD bank in a note.

2018-10-22,"NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Intercontinental Exchange Inc said its new Permian West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures contract deliverable in Houston, Texas, will begin trading on Monday. The trade month will be December and the contract will be deliverable at Magellan Midstream Partners LP’s East Houston terminal, ICE said in a statement. On Monday, ICE will list 36 months of flat-price Permian WTI contracts and calendar spreads, as well as inter-commodity spreads for the Houston contract versus Brent and the Houston contract versus WTI. The primary U.S. futures contract is delivered at the storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, as has been the case since the contract was started in the early 1980s. However, U.S. crude exports have surged after Washington lifted a decades-long ban, making Gulf Coast markets liquid and the sought-after destination for producers to send their barrels. “Houston has become the pricing center for U.S. crude oil production and exports, and the new Permian WTI futures contract is designed to serve hedging and trading opportunities in this growing market,” ICE said in a statement. The company first announced the contract in July, following which rival CME Group Inc said in September it would offer a new WTI Houston crude futures contract with three physical delivery locations on the Enterprise Products Partners LP’s Houston system, beginning in the fourth quarter.
