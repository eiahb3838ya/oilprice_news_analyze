2018-09-16,"(Adds Columbia Gas comment) Sept 16 (Reuters) - Residents of three Massachusetts communities were allowed to return to their homes on Sunday for the first time since a series of gas explosions killed one man and set dozens of buildings on fire. Natural gas leaks, believed to have been caused by over-pressurized lines, on Thursday triggered a series of explosions and fires in Andover, North Andover and Lawrence, communities northwest of Boston. Local officials ordered residents of some 8,000 homes and businesses to evacuate and shut off electricity to prevent further fires. It was the largest natural gas pipeline accident, in terms of the number of buildings involved, in the United States since 2010, when an interstate line operated by Pacific Gas and Electric Co ruptured in San Bruno, California, destroying 38 buildings, damaging 70 more, and killing eight people. Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, which provides service in the affected communities, declined to comment on Sunday on what caused the leaks, saying federal investigators would decide. The company had said before the releases that it would be upgrading gas lines in neighborhoods across the state, including the affected suburbs. Columbia Gas’ parent, NiSource Inc, has set up a phone center and an office in Lawrence to accept residents’ claims for property damage and costs related to the fires and evacuation, NiSource spokesman Ken Stammen said in an email. The National Transportation Safety Board, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, Massachusetts Fire Marshal’s office, and Federal Bureau of Investigation are investigating the gas leaks and explosions. “There is no sign that anyone did anything intentional,” Jennifer Mieth, a spokeswoman for the state Fire Marshal said on Friday. She said the FBI would stay involved until the NTSB, which is leading the probe, determined what caused the leaks. Utility crews worked through the weekend to complete checks and shut gas meters on homes and buildings in the affected areas, Eversource Energy, the utility overseeing the review, said on Sunday. State officials asked Eversource to oversee the initial response to the gas release. Electric power is being restored and will be available to all customers by noon on Sunday, Eversource said on its website. Utility workers are evaluating the area’s gas lines for safety and later will evaluate residents’ gas appliances before natural gas service can be restored, Eversource said.

2018-09-16,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German utility RWE, its works council and trade unions say they oppose plans to end coal-fired power generation in Germany around 2035, raising questions over a possible compromise between a government commission and environmentalists. RWE said the date was unacceptable and more investments in grids and renewable energy were needed to secure energy supply in the future. Climate protection goals need to be balanced with the interests of customers and employees, it said in a statement.  Its remarks were echoed by trade unions and RWE’s works council.  Der Spiegel news weekly earlier reported that Ronald Pofalla, one of four heads of a government body tasked with planning Germany’s exit from coal and setting an exit date by the end of the year, had proposed to abandon coal between 2035 and 2038.  The German economy ministry declined to comment. Germany aims to raise wind and solar power’s energy share from a third now to 65 percent by 2030 to help to cut carbon dioxide emissions and achieve its climate commitments. Coal-to-power production both from brown coal and imported hard coal accounts for 40 percent of Germany’s total power production, making the exit from coal difficult while maintaining reliable supply to industries and households. Germany is also abandoning nuclear power production by the end of 2022. Utility companies such as RWE and Uniper have said they are prepared, having absorbed declining coal plant revenues due to competition from renewable power and developed their own phase-out plans stretching into the 2040s. Environmental groups want to hasten the exit. The commission will try to broker compromises and help allocate federal funds to bring new industries into regions that are now dependent on coal mining.

2018-09-16,"WILSON, N.C., Sept 16 (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Florence was likely to weaken on Sunday as it swept through the Carolinas but dozens of communities are devastated and “epic” amounts of rain could still fall, officials said. The storm is expected to become a Tropical Depression as it trudged inland early Sunday, knocking out power and causing at least eight deaths as flood waters kept rising. North Carolina officials have reported at least seven storm-related fatalities with unconfirmed reports of a further three deaths. South Carolina authorities reported one death. “This is still a catastrophic, life threatening storm,” said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist with the National Weather Center’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. Winds have dropped to about 40 miles per hour (65 kph) since it roared ashore along the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast on Friday as a hurricane and it is crawling west over two states at 6 mph (9 kph), the National Hurricane Center in Miami said early Sunday. Taylor said the storm already dumped 30 inches of rain on some parts of the N.C. “This storm is still deadly and dangerous and it’s expected to turn northward later today into Virginia and the mid-Atlantic,” he said. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said: “This system is unloading epic amounts of rainfall, in some places measured in feet and not inches.” Rivers will continue to rise days after the rain has stopped, he said. Around 50 stranded people were airlifted by helicopter in North Carolina, said Petty Officer Michael Himes of the U.S. Coast Guard. More than 26,000 hunkered down in shelters. Roads were closed and authorities warned of landslides, tornadoes and flash floods, with dams and bridges in peril as rivers and creeks swelled. As of Saturday, about 676,000 homes and businesses were without power in North Carolina, along with 119,000 in South Carolina. The White House said President Donald Trump approved making federal funding available in some affected counties. Trump, who plans to visit the region next week and he tweeted his “deepest sympathies and warmth” to the families and friends of those who had lost their lives. Florence was drifting westward over South Carolina, reaching about 25 miles southeast of Columbia S.C. at 2 a.m. Sunday, the NHC said. Up to 40 inches (102 cm) of rain are expected along coastal areas of the Carolinas and up to 10 inches in southwestern Virginia, it said. In Fayetteville, a North Carolina city of about 210,000 people about 90 miles inland, authorities told thousands of residents near the Cape Fear River and Little River to get out of their homes by Sunday afternoon because of the flood risk. “If you are refusing to leave during this mandatory evacuation, you need to do things like notify your legal next of kin because the loss of life is very, very possible,” Mayor Mitch Colvin said at a news conference. “The worst is yet to come,” he added. The storm made landfall on Friday near Wilmington, a city of about 120,000 squeezed between North Carolina’s Atlantic coastline and the Cape Fear River. Near the Sutton Power Plant in Wilmington, coal ash leaked from a Duke Energy landfill. The site lost enough material to fill around two-thirds of an Olympic-sized pool, the company said in a statement, adding that it did not believe the incident posed a risk to health or the environment. Officials had warned before the storm rains could taint waterways with murky coal ash and toxic hog waste. Florence has already set a North Carolina record for rainfall totals, exceeding that of Hurricane Floyd, which struck in 1999 and caused 56 deaths. Floyd produced 24 inches of rain in some parts of the state, while Florence has already dumped about 30 inches in areas around Swansboro. In New Bern, about 90 miles northeast of Wilmington at the confluence of two rivers, Florence overwhelmed the town of 30,000 and left the downtown area under water. Some area residents described a harrowing retreat as the storm hit. “It was pitch black and I was just scared out of my mind,” said Tracy Singleton, who with her family later drove through torrential rain and high winds from her home near New Bern. South Carolina authorities said law enforcement officers were guarding against looting in evacuated areas, while Wilmington set a curfew on Saturday evening in response to looting in one area. As the United States dealt with Florence, a super typhoon swirled towards Hong Kong and the Chinese coast on Sunday, gaining in strength over the South China Sea after hurtling through the Philippines, where it wreaked havoc that killed at least 25.

2018-09-16,"WILSON, N.C. (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Florence dumped “epic” amounts of rain on North and South Carolina as it trudged inland on Saturday, knocking out power and causing at least eight deaths as flood waters that have devastated many communities kept rising. Florence’s intensity has diminished since it roared ashore along the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast on Friday as a hurricane. But its slow march over the two states, crawling west at only 3 miles per hour (6 km per hour), is expected to leave large parts of the region deluged in the coming days, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said late Saturday. “This system is unloading epic amounts of rainfall, in some places measured in feet and not inches,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news briefing. His state has already endured record rainfall, with much more forecast to come. Rivers will continue to rise days after the rain has stopped, he said.  “This is a hurricane event followed by a flood event,” said South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster. With flood waters advancing rapidly in many communities, around 50 stranded people had been airlifted out by helicopter in North Carolina, said Petty Officer Michael Himes of the U.S. Coast Guard. More than 26,000 hunkered down in shelters. Numerous roads were closed, and authorities warned of the risk of landslides, tornadoes and flash floods, with dams and bridges in peril as rivers and creeks swelled.
