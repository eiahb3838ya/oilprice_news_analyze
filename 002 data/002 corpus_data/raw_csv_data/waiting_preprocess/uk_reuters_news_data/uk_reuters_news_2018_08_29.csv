2018-08-29,"* Nasdaq, S&P 500 at record highs with tech names in the lead * Markets hope for U.S.-Canada trade deal * Turkey’s lira hits a two-week low; oil spikes on Iran news (New throughout, updates prices, market activity and comment to reflect afternoon U.S. trading) By Trevor Hunnicutt NEW YORK, Aug 29 (Reuters) - A major global stock index jumped to 5-1/2-month highs on Wednesday as optimism on the potential for U.S. trade deals cleared the path for technology stocks to resume their leadership mantle. Talks to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) hinge on Canada after Monday’s deal between the other parties to that pact, the United States and Mexico. MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.39 percent as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq U.S. stock indexes hit all-time highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 87.04 points, or 0.33 percent, to 26,151.06, the S&P 500 gained 16.96 points, or 0.59 percent, to 2,914.48 and the Nasdaq Composite added 69.34 points, or 0.86 percent, to 8,099.38. Aberdeen Standard Investments head of global strategy Andrew Milligan said investor optimism was tinged with caution. He noted there it was hard to predict U.S. trade negotiations which could make markets choppy. “It is an erratic rally,” he said. “We need a bit more fuel to the fire.” U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to proceed with Mexico alone and levy tariffs on Canada if it did not come on board with revised trade terms. But a trade deal without Canada might not win approval from the U.S. Congress. “The final decisions are unlikely until 2019 at the earliest,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note to clients. Still, familiar leaders from this long bull market run resumed their leadership role, with Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp among those lifting Wall Street indexes higher. The dollar, which has been a safe haven from trade concerns, turned negative after early gains. An index of the U.S. currency against several trading partners fell 0.12 percent. The Mexican peso gained 0.44 percent versus the greenback, while the Canadian dollar rose 0.05 percent. Elsewhere in the global trade conflict, a deadline for public comment on Trump’s increased tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods was less than a week away on Sept. 5. The White House has said it wants to settle NAFTA before negotiating with China. “There’s a big debate taking place among investors: is Trump hoping to reach agreement with all the big players to demonstrate what a successful negotiator he is, or is he trying to make sure he’s got agreement with NAFTA and the EU and therefore can turn all the firepower on to China?” said Milligan. Emerging market stocks rose 0.10 percent, but remained under pressure from weakening currencies. An index of those countries’ currencies fell 0.29 percent in dollar terms. Turkey’s lira extended losses, down 2.08 percent against the dollar, a two-week low, as concern grew about the effects of the country’s currency crisis, and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak was quoted as saying he did not see a risk to the economy. Dollar-denominated Turkish bank bonds also fell after Moody’s sounded the alarm over the sector. Oil prices rose about 1 percent, supported by a drawdown in U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles and news of falling Iranian crude shipments as U.S. sanctions deterred buyers. U.S. crude rose 1.31 percent to $69.43 per barrel and Brent was last at $77.03, up 1.42 percent on the day. Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Additional reporting by Wayne

2018-08-29,"DAKAR, Aug 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Nigeria is on the verge of a boom in mini power grids that could stimulate rural economies and bring jobs to frustrated youth thinking of leaving, researchers said on Wednesday. Less than half of all Nigerians and only about a third of those living in rural areas have access to electricity, according to the United States Agency for International Development. Minigrids - stand-alone power systems that often use solar power and can generate electricity for 5,000 to 10,000 people - are starting to take off in Nigeria and could change that, the Rocky Mountain Institute said in a report this week. “These minigrids could drive a significant economic change in rural Nigeria,” said Sachi Graber, an associate with the U.S.-based non-profit and co-author of the report. More than 80 percent of Nigerian business owners cite electrification problems as their main challenge, said the study, produced with the Nigerian Economic Summit Group, a think tank. Minigrids give rural businesses a cheaper, more reliable alternative to the diesel generators people use now to power everything from sawmills to barbershops, said James Sherwood, co-author of the report. Change is already evident in parts of Nigeria where they have been installed, he said. “As soon as the minigrid shows up, you see people moving in from other areas and the economy grows,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Poverty has driven thousands of Nigerians to try to migrate to Europe in recent years, and many have died on the journey through the Sahara desert and across the Mediterranean. The fact that electricity access is a big driver of migration within countries means it could influence international migration too, said Leo Roberts, a specialist in renewable energy at the Overseas Development Institute. “People tend to move from places with lower levels of access to electricity, which tend to be rural areas, to urban areas where there is a higher level of access,” he said. “So one of the things you see (with minigrids) is that people are more likely to stay where they are.” After Tanzania, Nigeria is the African country that is farthest along in developing minigrids because the government has taken an active interest, Roberts said. But challenges remain, primarily the lack of financing and nervousness of investors to put money in new markets, he added. Reporting by Nellie Peyton, Editing by Claire Cozens. Please

2018-08-29,"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Bosnia’s central government adopted a long-term energy strategy on Wednesday after years of political wrangling between its two regions, paving the way for major funding from the European Union and other investors.  “With this act, we completed the adoption of a package of four most important strategies for economic reforms,” said Bosnia’s Prime Minister Denis Zvizdic.  “We stopped a negative trend that meant we could not apply for energy projects and lost hundreds of millions of euros of investments and grants,” Zvizdic told a news conference. Bosnia, which aspires to join the EU, has long struggled to adopt strategies for transportation, agriculture, the environment and energy, which are requirements of receiving funding for these sectors from the wealthy bloc. The country’s two autonomous regions, the Serb Republic and the Federation dominated by Muslim Bosniaks and Croats, failed to harmonise their regional sectoral strategies with the one proposed by the central government. “This document opens the prospect of development of the energy sector, competition, and unlocks the EU pre-accession funds and grants from the Western Balkans Investment Fund,” said Foreign Trade Minister Mirko Sarovic. He said the framework strategy for 2018-2035, drafted under EU sponsorship and designed to secure electricity supply and a transition to green energy, anticipated an investment of about 9 billion Bosnian marka (4.19 billion pounds).  But Bosnia still needs to change its regulations to meet terms set by the European Energy Community, Sarovic added. Unlike its Balkan neighbours, which rely on imports to meet much of their energy demand, Bosnia is able to export power thanks partly to its hydro power capacity, which provides 40 percent of its electricity. The rest of its power comes from coal-fired plants. Separately, the Serb Republic and Serbia agreed on Wednesday to jointly build two hydro power plants with a total capacity of 95 megawatts on the Drina river that runs along the border between Bosnia and Serbia, to help diversify their energy mix. The Prime Minister of the Serb Republic Zeljka Cvijanovic said after a joint session of the two governments in the southeastern Bosnian town of Trebinje that the hydro power plants Foca and Paunci were expected to cost about 181.07 million pounds.

2018-08-29,"STAVANGER, Norway (Reuters) - Norway’s Equinor is focusing its green efforts on offshore wind, a goal it is already on its way to achieve, but some investors are concerned about the impact this shift will have on the company’s bottom line. European oil and gas companies are diversifying their portfolio to include less-emitting sources of energy as a result of the Paris 2015 agreement, which outlines a shift from fossil fuels this century.  Equinor, formerly Statoil, is betting on offshore wind, leveraging its expertise in operating offshore platforms and its ability to scale up small projects into industrial ones. Last year Equinor opened the first floating offshore wind farm, off Scotland. And on Tuesday it said it was planning to use floating wind turbines to power offshore oil installations, in a world first. “I think the floating concept is very fascinating. We have a leading position there right now,” Equinor CEO Eldar Saetre told Reuters.   Equinor also plans to build three large, bottom-fixed wind projects off the coasts of the United States, Poland and Britain.  The three projects alone could cost around $11.7 billion to build at current prices, which already fulfils the announced  budget of 100 billion crowns, or $11.8 billion, according to a Reuters estimate.  By comparison, Repsol has gone into operating hydropower plants, Total is developing solar power and owns a battery producer, while BP bought Britain’s largest electric vehicle charging company. “For Equinor, it’s more important (to diversify) because it depends more on upstream, compared to its peers like Shell, Total or BP, which have larger downstream operations which will be less impacted by the energy transition,” Rohan Murphy, an analyst at Allianz Global Investors, told Reuters.      Equinor has said it aims to dedicate up to 20 percent of its capital expenditure by 2030 to renewables. Saetre said the plan could amount to 100 billion Norwegian crowns for the period, roughly $12 billion.  “It could be more than 100 billion crowns, but it could be also less. It’s not a fixed number,” Saetre said.      Annual spending is likely to increase as 2030 approaches and more projects reach maturity, he added. A spokeswoman said the company expected costs associated with offshore wind to fall in the future, allowing more to be built with the same money. Equinor has said it planned to spend between $500 million and $750 million on “new energy solutions” in 2017-2020, and $750 million to $1.5 billion in 2020-2025.  Equinor has also bought Danske Commodities, an electricity and gas trader, but sees offshore wind as its main growth area. Executives told Reuters on Tuesday they planned to make the final investment decision on Britain’s 3.6-gigawatt-capacity Dogger Bank project in the North Sea by May 2019, and intended to take part in an auction to supply offshore wind power to the state of New York later this year. It is also opening an office in Japan to position for potential offshore wind tenders there.  It aims to reduce the production cost of floating wind power to 40-60 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) by 2030, making it competitive with other sources of energy, from around 200 euros per MWh at its Scottish project by scaling up and simplifying the technology.  Equinor’s green shift came soon after Saetre took the helm of Statoil in 2015 following the departure of Helge Lund to lead BG. One of Saetre’s first decisions was to establish a separate business segment to drive investments in renewable and low-carbon technologies. Two years later, he pushed for Statoil to be renamed Equinor to reflect its commitment toward becoming a “broad energy” company. Some in Norway protested, shocked that a national champion established for 46 years would drop its name. “The energy transition in the oil industry is probably the hottest topic now,” WoodMackenzie research director Valentina Kretzschmar told Reuters. But some investors are concerned, particularly those on the sell-side, who demand maximum returns on a quarterly basis, she said. “The jury is still out whether it is the right thing for oil majors to invest in renewables at all,” she said.  “There is no question that renewables and electric cars (fleet) will continue to grow. Whether oil and gas companies are right to invest is an open question.”  There is also caution among buy-side, longer-term investors, keener for oil companies to grapple with the energy transition.  “We don’t want them to go and just greenwash things ... They have to make things work and show that they are worthy of the capital,” said Murphy at Allianz Global Investors. Saetre is convinced this is the way forward.  “Some people say we should stick to producing oil and gas, but I have realized that at some point the energy transition will have an impact on that. You can get to a point where oil and gas starts to shrink,” he said.

Talks to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) hinge on Canada after Monday’s deal between the other parties to that pact, the United States and Mexico. Investors are also nervous ahead of a deadline for the next round of China-U.S. tariffs next week. MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, ticked up 0.2 percent. The index closed higher on Tuesday but off the 5-1/2-month high hit soon after Mexico and the United States struck their deal. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 22.18 points, or 0.09 percent, to 26,086.2, the S&P 500 gained 10.99 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,908.51 and the Nasdaq Composite added 55.61 points, or 0.69 percent, to 8,085.65. “The market is quite right to say after the knee-jerk reaction higher in the Mexican peso and equities, a) there was remarkably little detail, and b) what is the state of Canada?” said Aberdeen Standard Investments head of global strategy Andrew Milligan. U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to proceed with Mexico alone and levy tariffs on Canada if it does not come on board with revised trade terms. But a trade deal might struggle to win approval from Congress unless Canada comes on board. “The final decisions are unlikely until 2019 at the earliest,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note to clients, saying Democrats might gain control of the majority in Congress by then, which could make agreement more difficult.

2018-08-29,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s largest gas processing plant Kollsnes, a key facility for British exports which faced outages last winter, is having additional upgrades this summer to protect it against extreme weather later in the year, operator Gassco told Reuters. In late February, when a cold snap dubbed the ‘Beast from the East’ hit Europe sending energy prices to 10-year highs, Kollsnes had to drastically reduce output as equipment parts froze, stripping Britain of much-needed gas supplies. On March 1, the second day of the plant’s outage, the lack of supplies in Britain, coinciding with high demand, caused prompt gas prices in the country to quadruple, with the within-day price reaching 160 pence per therm, the highest since the liberalisation of the market in the 1990s. “The winterization programme for Kollsnes has also been updated ... Extensive heating measures, to ensure the best possible production availability also during winter and extreme weather conditions, is an example,” said Gassco’s spokeswoman Lisbet Kallevik. Gassco is also working on reinforcing the power grid as a part of this project, added Kallevik. The Kollsnes plant is at the middle of its planned maintenance period at the moment and works are scheduled to continue until Oct. 1. Even though maintenance at Norway’s gas processing plants happens virtually every year, this summer’s works are much more extensive and targeted. A lot of the equipment that was more exposed to the elements is being insulated to withstand cold. The extraordinary weather conditions that Kollsnes faced in February - a combination of very low temperatures that reached as low as minus 8 degrees Celsius and strong wind - created a challenge engineers call a “cold bridge”. In the event of a cold bridge, impulse lines, which are small pipes used to connect larger gas pipes with measuring instruments, freeze. As a result, typical process systems, like pressure transmitters and pressure controllers connected to impulse lines, used to trace heat, are disrupted. Gassco is now insulating the instrumented systems and will boost heat tracing of the equipment exposed to the weather elements to reduce vulnerability and the technical risk exposure on the plant. “Our target is to secure full production availability at the plant at all times, but still it’s impossible to promise that we will not see any outages this winter,” Kallevik said. Gassco declined to disclose the cost of the additional maintenance at Kollsnes. Equinor, Kollsnes’ technical service provider, is also evaluating its short and long-term routines for extremely cold weather to reduce the probability and consequences of equipment failure, said the firm’s spokeswoman Elin Isaksen.

2018-08-29,"CAIRO/TRIPOLI (Reuters) - A bout of fighting in Libya’s capital has laid bare the fragility of a militia cartel that had brought a veneer of stability to the city and encouraged the gradual return of foreign diplomats and plans for elections in December.   Major battles have become rarer in Tripoli since last year as a handful of armed factions aligned with the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) consolidated their control.  But the ascent of four or five “super militias” has created resentment among groups excluded from the capital and from access to the spoils of Libya’s informal economy. That has heightened the risk of conflict and made the challenge of disbanding militias or integrating them into regular security forces more complex, diplomats and analysts say.   Bringing militias to heel is seen as crucial to resolving a conflict that has divided Libya since a NATO-backed uprising forced Muammar Gaddafi from power seven years ago, slashing oil production and giving space to migrant smugglers and militants.  Fighting on Monday and Tuesday pitted the Seventh Brigade, or Kaniyat, from Tarhouna, a town 65 km (45 miles) southeast of Tripoli, against the Tripoli Revolutionaries’ Brigades (TRB) and the Nawasi, two of the capital’s largest armed groups.   The Kaniyat and other groups from outside Tripoli have noticed the success of rivals inside the city with growing unease. Reports about the wealth, power and extravagant lifestyles of some Tripoli militia commanders have fuelled resentment. “The profits from state capture now go to a narrower set of armed groups than ever before,” said Wolfram Lacher, a researcher at the German think-tank SWP. “That’s a very dangerous situation because it excludes powerful forces from access to levers of the state and administration, and this is now causing those forces to build alliances against the big militias in Tripoli.” As they launched their incursion into Tripoli, Kaniyat denounced their rivals as the “Daesh (Islamic State) of public money”, promising to “cleanse” them from the country. Kaniyat made gains as tanks, armoured vehicles and pickup trucks mounted with anti-aircraft guns were deployed in densely populated residential areas of southern Tripoli, with explosions and heavy artillery fire echoing across the city. At least five people were killed and nearly 30 wounded on the first day, officials said.  Tripoli’s big armed groups claim official status through the GNA - which is opposed by a rival government and military faction based in the east of the sprawling North African country - but act with autonomy. They guard strategic buildings, control Tripoli’s airport and have infiltrated ministries and many of the banks, giving them access to coveted dollars at the official exchange rate, about five times cheaper than the parallel rate.   “They place their people throughout the state administration, particularly in positions that offer control of economic resources,” said Lacher.   Since last summer an ex-prime minister, the mayor of Tripoli and the head of the state religious authority have been among a series of senior figures to be abducted then released by militias. A key member of the GNA’s leadership, Fathi al-Majbari, withdrew from his position after an armed group attacked his residence in June. Earlier this month the National Oil Corporation denounced militia threats against the newly appointed head of its fuel distribution unit over efforts to tackle smuggling, and the sovereign wealth fund said that it had been forced by threats and abductions to move premises.  Prominent Libyans based abroad have said they seek the protection of armed militia factions, not the government, when they travel to Tripoli. Diplomatic staff evacuated amid fighting in 2014 and now tentatively returning ultimately depend on armed groups for access and protection. Critics of a French-led plan to hold national elections on Dec. 10 worry that a free vote will be impossible, and that militias will challenge with force any result they don’t like. “I think it’s a race against time and I feel like the (Libyan) state’s disappearing,” said one senior diplomat. “It’s hard now to tell where’s the state and where’s the militia.” Gaddafi’s four-decade-long, one-man dictatorship left Libya with few effective state institutions after his overthrow.

2018-08-29,"STAVANGER, Norway (Reuters) - After years of restraint since crude prices slumped in 2014, oil services companies are now at loggerheads with producers as they battle for what they see as a fair share of the sector recovery. Oil industry suppliers say they have cut costs and prices to the bone and the recent rebound in crude justifies better rewards for anything from rigs to logistics and engineering services. Their overtures have met with stubborn resistance from producers. But there are increasing signs that something has to give, including recent strikes at North Sea platforms. “The cost savings that we have achieved over the past three years are not sustainable,” said Thierry Pilenko, Executive Chairman of TechnipFMC (FTI.N), one of the world’s biggest oil services groups. “A rig that was once at $600,000 day is now at $150,000, which is not even cash breakeven,” he added, referring to rig rental rates. “Cost inflation will come back ... The drilling industry working below breakeven is not sustainable.” The oil market is cyclical by nature — if crude prices fall, so does investment and then output, which in turn drives up prices — and oil services companies ride the rollercoaster by using the upturns to raise their prices to offset the downturns. Global exploration and production spending shot up by a quarter in 2005, fell 8 percent in 2009, jumped by about 12 percent two years later and then tanked by more than a fifth in 2016, according to data from consultancy firm Rystad Energy. GRAPHIC: Oil services sector's boom and bust cycles - tmsnrt.rs/2N4DlU0 Consequently, average rig rates that were about $200,000 for a floating rig in 2005 more than doubled by 2012 and then fell to about $160,000 last year, Rystad said. “It is still a feast or famine cycle,” the CEO of oilfield services group Baker Hughes (BHGE.N), Lorenzo Simonelli, told an industry conference in the Norwegian oil capital of Stavanger. After benchmark oil futures contracts LCOc1 slumped from more than $110 a barrel in 2014 to less than $30 in early 2016, oil producers cut spending drastically and promised shareholders that cost discipline was here to stay. GRAPHIC - Boom and Bust Cycles of Oil Services Sector: tmsnrt.rs/2wppPke Signs of rising rates have begun to emerge in the United States, but oil producers are loath to put the genie back in the bottle. “There might be pressure on costs, but we will never forget what we have learned,” Equinor Chief Executive Eldar Saetre told the Stavanger conference. Indeed, Equinor’s announcement on Tuesday that it plans to drill 3,000 production and exploration wells off Norway during the next two decades came with a caveat. “There is no room for cost inflation in those plans,” said Arne Sigve Nylund, head of Equinor’s Norwegian operations. “We need to deliver at the same level we are now ... I call on suppliers to work with us on how to deliver at the lowest possible cost.” But with oil now trading around $75 a barrel, strikes at several of Total’s (TOTF.PA) North Sea offshore platforms are testimony to an industry wrestling with keeping efficiencies high and costs down.  The way contracts are structured between producers and services will be key to the future level of costs. “There is a big dichotomy now. Some of the contractors are expecting to see price increases.

2018-08-29,"STAVANGER, Norway (Reuters) - After years of restraint since crude prices slumped in 2014, oil services companies are now at loggerheads with producers as they battle for what they see as a fair share of the sector recovery. Oil industry suppliers say they have cut costs and prices to the bone and the recent rebound in crude justifies better rewards for anything from rigs to logistics and engineering services. Their overtures have met with stubborn resistance from producers. But there are increasing signs that something has to give, including recent strikes at North Sea platforms. “The cost savings that we have achieved over the past three years are not sustainable,” said Thierry Pilenko, Executive Chairman of TechnipFMC (FTI.N), one of the world’s biggest oil services groups. “A rig that was once at $600,000 (465,441.01 pounds) day is now at $150,000, which is not even cash breakeven,” he added, referring to rig rental rates. “Cost inflation will come back ... The drilling industry working below breakeven is not sustainable.” The oil market is cyclical by nature — if crude prices fall, so does investment and then output, which in turn drives up prices — and oil services companies ride the rollercoaster by using the upturns to raise their prices to offset the downturns. Global exploration and production spending shot up by a quarter in 2005, fell 8 percent in 2009, jumped by about 12 percent two years later and then tanked by more than a fifth in 2016, according to data from consultancy firm Rystad Energy. Consequently, average rig rates that were about $200,000 for a floating rig in 2005 more than doubled by 2012 and then fell to about $160,000 last year, Rystad said. “It is still a feast or famine cycle,” the CEO of oilfield services group Baker Hughes (BHGE.N), Lorenzo Simonelli, told an industry conference in the Norwegian oil capital of Stavanger. After benchmark oil futures contracts LCOc1 slumped from more than $110 a barrel in 2014 to less than $30 in early 2016, oil producers cut spending drastically and promised shareholders that cost discipline was here to stay. (Graphic: reut.rs/2BZiMnw) Signs of rising rates have begun to emerge in the United States, but oil producers are loath to put the genie back in the bottle. “There might be pressure on costs, but we will never forget what we have learned,” Equinor Chief Executive Eldar Saetre told the Stavanger conference. Indeed, Equinor’s announcement on Tuesday that it plans to drill 3,000 production and exploration wells off Norway during the next two decades came with a caveat. “There is no room for cost inflation in those plans,” said Arne Sigve Nylund, head of Equinor’s Norwegian operations. “We need to deliver at the same level we are now ... I call on suppliers to work with us on how to deliver at the lowest possible cost.” But with oil now trading around $75 a barrel, strikes at several of Total’s (TOTF.PA) North Sea offshore platforms are testimony to an industry wrestling with keeping efficiencies high and costs down. The way contracts are structured between producers and services will be key to the future level of costs. “There is a big dichotomy now. Some of the contractors are expecting to see price increases. They are almost saying ‘it’s my turn now’,” Luis Araujo, CEO of oil services company Aker Solutions (AKSOL.OL), said. “I don’t buy into that. I think we should work together.” Araujo pointed to clients such as Aker BP (AKERBP.OL) offering contracts more akin to “incentive schemes” than ways to squeeze margins. “In the future, maybe suppliers are going to get paid by performance. So instead of getting paid by the daily rates, (you) will be paid by how many metres you can drill.” Equinor’s Saetre put it even more succinctly at the Stavenger conference, with the words of U.S. rock star Bruce Springsteen emblazoned on the big screen: “Nobody wins unless everybody wins.” But given oil producers’ own constraints, the message might not have trickled through quite yet. “We have to be a bit cautious because the guys doing the presentations are the leaders.

2018-08-29,"IN KYIN KONE, Myanmar (Reuters) - More than 50,000 people have evacuated their homes in central Myanmar after part of a dam failed on Wednesday, inundating communities and damaging a bridge on a major highway, officials said. The incident spotlights safety concerns about dams in Southeast Asia following last month’s collapse of a hydroelectric dam in neighbouring Laos that displaced thousands of people and killed at least 27. Myanmar fire authorities sent a team to the dam after the breach at 5:30 a.m. (2300 GMT) unleashed water into the nearby town of Swar and several other settlements. “The (spillway) of the dam was broken and flooded the two villages close to the highway,” the fire department said on its Facebook page.  Authorities had given the dam the all-clear after an inspection just days earlier, despite residents’ concerns about overspill, state-run media said. “If you go to my house, there are no belongings left,” said farmer Aung Aung, whose village of Kone Gyi Lan Sone was inundated without warning, sending him scrambling to tell his neighbours. They all ran to higher ground to escape. “It was only after that we realised the situation,” he told Reuters. “The little shop over there is completely destroyed and washed away,” he added, as floodwaters and broken branches swirled around the wooden homes in the village. Many people, including some not directly hit by flooding, had decided to leave their homes for fear the waters could rise further, said an official of the Natural Disaster Management Department who sought anonymity, in the absence of authorisation to speak to media. As many as 14 clusters of hamlets were battling flooding, the department said.     In all, 12,000 households, or a total of 54,000 people, were displaced, said another official, from the Department of Relief and Resettlement, who also declined to be named.     A surge of water as high as 8 feet (2.4 m) hit the first downstream village of Kyun Taw Su, besides flooding Swar and part of the larger town of Yedashe, said Ko Lwin, a journalist based in Swar.  A Yedashe administrative official said authorities could not rule out that people were still trapped in small villages near the dam, adding that of three people reported missing and feared  swept away by the waters, one was found alive. “The two other people are still missing,” said the official, Aye Myin Kyi. “We don’t assume them dead, we are still looking for them.”  About 7,000 people were staying in 17 camps in the town, she added, while 16 more held 3,500 people in Taungoo, the nearest major town, with still more in monasteries and elsewhere.  Pictures on social media showed soldiers using makeshift bamboo rafts and kayaks to evacuate people from flooded homes and shops, some carrying children and the elderly through knee-deep waters. The waters had begun to subside on Wednesday afternoon but still rushed beneath a damaged bridge along the road linking Myanmar’s major cities of Yangon, Mandalay and the capital Naypyitaw surrounded by acres of flooded fields.  The bridge stayed closed to heavy traffic as the carriageway for vehicles travelling north to south had buckled.   “When the water flooded the bridge we closed it, and by the time we arrived here around 8 a.m., two columns had sunk around two feet,” said Deputy Minister of Construction Kyaw Linn, who joined in repair work by surveyors and workers. Myanmar’s heavy annual monsoon rains have caused widespread flooding that displaced more than 100,000 people and killed at least 11 in July.  Some dams were reported to be overflowing this month, but an irrigation and water management official told the privately-run Myanmar Times newspaper there was no risk of a collapse. The dam built across the Swar creek in 2004 can hold 216,350 acre-feet of water to irrigate more than 20,000 acres (8,100 hectares) of farmland, says a Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation document posted online. Swar residents had expressed concerns that the dam was overflowing, said Ko Lwin, the journalist. On Monday, the state-run Myanmar Alin newspaper said an administrator and an irrigation official had inspected the dam. “There is nothing to be concerned about,” it reported the administrator, Tun Nay Aung, as saying, as the dam had not exceeded its capacity.  Reuters was unable to trace contact details for Tun Nay Aung on Wednesday. Government spokesman Zaw Htay did not answer telephone calls from Reuters to seek comment regarding the prior concerns over the dam. The Myanmar government is assessing some dam projects to help eliminate chronic power shortages, but their potential environmental impact makes the projects controversial.    Large areas were still cut off by the floods, said Aye Aye, 47, one of the relief providers in the Swar area. “I don’t know about all the people,” she added. “But there were quite a lot of dogs. Motorcycles were also underwater. (We saw) dead buffaloes, dead cows.” Additional reporting by Aye Min Thant, Sam Aung Moon, Thu Thu Aung and Simon Lewis; Editing by Michael Perry and Clarence Fernandez",https://uk.reuters.com/article/myanmar-dam/update-3-more-than-50000-evacuated-in-myanmar-as-homes-shops-flooded-after-dam-fails-idUKL3N1VK29D,29 Aug 2018,"* At least two people missing after being swept away

Talks to renew a NAFTA trade agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada - after Monday’s U.S.-Mexico deal - hinge on Canada. Uncertainty over when a final agreement might pass the U.S. Congress also kept trade muted. MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, eased 0.1 percent from the 5-1/2-month high hit after Mexico and the United States struck their deal. “The market is quite right to say after the knee-jerk reaction higher in the Mexican peso and equities, a) there was remarkably little detail, and b) what is the state of Canada?” Aberdeen Standard Investments head of global strategy Andrew Milligan said. “It helps this rebound in risk assets we’re seeing but it is an erratic rally because we need a bit more fuel to the fire,” he said. U.S. stocks were set for a cautious open with eMini futures for the S&P 500 giving back gains to trade flat while Dow Jones futures fell 0.1 percent. European stocks drifted either side of flat, with the index of top 50 companies down 0.02 percent by 1247 GMT. U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to proceed with Mexico alone and levy tariffs on Canada if it does not come on board with revised trade terms. But a trade deal might struggle to win approval from Congress unless Canada comes on board. “The final decisions are unlikely until 2019 at the earliest,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note to clients, saying that control of the majority in Congress might have gone to the Democrats by then, which could make agreement more difficult. Currencies reflected investors’ lingering uncertainty. Against the U.S. dollar, the Canadian dollar fell 0.1 percent while Mexico’s peso declined 0.3 percent. European autos stocks also slid 0.3 percent as details of the agreement on autos emerged. Auto executives and sources told Reuters a side agreement would allow the U.S. to slap punitive tariffs of up to 25 percent on imports of Mexican-made cars, sport utility vehicles and auto parts above certain volumes. On another front of the global trade conflicts, a deadline for public comment on Trump’s increased tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods was less than a week away on Sept. 5. “End-of-month flows could start to take hold into the end of the week, and combined with light news flow and the risk of impending trade war escalation could result in conviction remaining light,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note. The White House has said it wants to settle NAFTA before negotiating with China, suggesting trade disputes will run well into 2019. “There’s a big debate taking place among investors: is Trump hoping to reach agreement with all the big players to demonstrate what a successful negotiator he is, or is he trying to make sure he’s got agreement with NAFTA and the EU and therefore can turn all the firepower on to China?” Milligan said. Major currencies quietened down after a turbulent few days, with the dollar index 0.2 percent firmer at 94.887 after touching a four-week low overnight. The euro eased to $1.1661 after hitting a one-month high at $1.1733 overnight. The currency’s gains are being capped by concerns over Italy’s budget. “We believe that Italy is headed on a collision course with the EU as the two meet to discuss Italy’s budget in September,” Man Group portfolio managers wrote in a note. But peripheral euro zone bond markets recovered slightly. Italy’s 10-year and 2-year bond yields fell on media reports that Italy may ask the European Central Bank for new bond purchasing. Emerging market stocks came under renewed pressure, falling 0.2 percent as the dollar rose. Turkey’s lira extended losses, down 3.2 percent to 6.45 to the dollar, a two-week low, concern grew about the effects of the country’s currency crisis, and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak was quoted as saying he did not see a risk to the economy. Dollar-denominated Turkish bank bonds also fell after Moody’s sounded the alarm over the sector. Overall, emerging markets have clawed back from this month’s sharp sell-off. “On balance people are looking to buy EM assets but it would be foolish to say buy them all because there are still vulnerabilities in a sizeable number,” Aberdeen Standard’s Milligan said. In commodity markets, spot gold rose 0.2 percent to $1,203.34 an ounce. Oil prices extended gains on news of a fall in Iranian crude supplies as U.S. sanctions deter buyers. Brent gained 0.6 percent to $76.38 a barrel. U.S. crude climbed 0.7 percent to $69.00. For Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets: Reporting by Helen Reid

2018-08-29,"LAGOS, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s state oil company plans to conduct a feasibility study for setting up two condensate refineries with a total capacity of 200,000 barrels per day (bpd), it said on Wednesday. The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said in a statement it planned to set up the condensate refineries in partnership with private partners in the southern states of Delta and Imo. Maikanti Baru, NNPC’s managing director, said the commission had received bids from companies willing to conduct the feasibility study for the NNPC. Nigeria currently has a 445,000 bpd refining system which operates well below capacity due to mismanagement and lack of investment, forcing the NNPC to import the bulk of the country’s gasoline. NNPC earlier this month said it was considering plans to establish a 100,000 bpd brownfield refinery at its Port Harcourt and Warri sites in collaboration with private sector investors. Baru said the condensate project was part of strategies aimed at eliminating imports of petroleum products and guaranteeing energy security in Nigeria. Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote, is building a 650,000 bpd refinery near Lagos, which would meet Nigeria’s current demand and also for export. NNPC will seek partners to invest in the project, Baru said, adding the initiative would increase NNPC’s refining capacity to 645,000 bpd. The state oil company could cede control in the project, he said. Legislation aimed at overhauling Nigeria’s oil industry will, when implemented, mean the NNPC will be governed by company law, which will ensure stability and transparency, Baru said. However, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters the presidency had rebuffed the landmark oil industry reform bill in its current form and sent it back to parliament over sections that deal with management of the NNPC.

2018-08-29,"(Adds code) By Kagondu Njagi KIBUMBU, Kenya, Aug 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Four years ago, Njeru Kamuru nearly quit dairy farming. But when he learned that a solar-powered milk-cooling plant was to be built in his Kenyan village, he changed his mind. Before then, Kamuru said, he struggled to sell more than half of the 12 litres of milk his brace of cows gave during their morning and evening milking sessions. Selling those six litres earned him about a dollar; the rest of the milk went to his relatives on credit or was drunk by his wife and four children. Breaking even was hard, he said, with the key problem a lack of refrigerated storage. “I could spend the whole day at the farm waiting to sell milk to my fellow village customers,” Kamuru told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in Kibumbu village in central Kenya. And if the morning’s milk supply was difficult to sell - and it was - he was at least able to pasteurize it to ensure it did not go off. The evening’s milk supply was trickier. “If there were no customers, it all went to waste,” he said. Others in the Kibumbu Dairy Farmers Association had the same problem, so they approached the governor of Tharaka Nithi County and demanded that he honour a 2012 campaign pledge to construct a milk-cooling plant. In 2015, the solar-powered facility opened, using county funds. These days, Kamuru no longer sells milk to the villagers. His family uses two litres a day, while the rest goes to the community-owned plant. “The amount I deliver is recorded every day, and then I am paid at the end of the month,” he said. Kenyans often struggle with the country’s unreliable electricity supply, with the problem particularly acute in rural areas. For the country’s dairy farmers - who, according to the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), have 3.2 million head of dairy cattle - it’s a particular problem. Kibumbu’s solar milk-cooling plant ensures that farmers like Kamuru can store their milk safely, day or night, without it going off. The timing is good: demand for dairy products is rising fast, particularly in rapidly growing urban areas, according to the Kenya Livestock Producers Association (KLPA). “This means that farmers must have access to storage facilities that work around the 24-hour clock without interruption,” said Patrick Kimani, who heads the KLPA. “Solar-powered milk coolers provide such a solution.” Typically, local governments pay for milk-cooling plants, then hand over ownership to dairy associations, Tharaka Nithi County Governor Muthomi Njuki said in a phone interview. It is then the responsibility of the farmers to pay for maintenance, Njuki added. The Tharaka Nithi facility does that by deducting 10 percent of each farmer’s monthly earnings. Apart from being community-owned, the KLPA’s Kimani said, solar milk-cooling plants are cheap to maintain and can deal with the blackouts that continue to trouble Kenya. The dairy industry is an important part of Kenya’s economy, worth about 3.5 percent of GDP, the FAO estimates, with about 2 million people directly or indirectly working in it. Kimani said the country has about one million dairy farmers, but just 15 percent can connect to the national electricity grid to refrigerate their milk. Some of the rest rely on one of 50 solar cooling plants set up in 10 counties since 2014, Kimani said. With the cost of solar technology falling, he added, building more plants will become increasingly affordable in coming years to help Kenya’s 500-plus dairy associations. With demand for dairy products climbing, Kimani said, there are plans for plants in key production areas to boost their capacity to process milk into products such as yoghurt and milk powder. At the office of the Kibumbu Dairy Farmers Association, manager Lucy Muthoni divides her day between monitoring the milk containers that farmers bring in, and checking that the solar system on the plant’s roof is keeping the coolers humming. The plant receives more than 5,000 litres of milk a day, she said, with about one-third consumed by people in nearby Chuka town and the rest sent to the capital, Nairobi, for processing. Solar power and milk make for a good combination, she said. “Milk is most likely to go bad when the day is hot. Yet it is when it is hot that the solar system can absorb and store more energy to keep the coolers operating during the day and at night,” Muthoni told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. And, she added, the fact that milk can be refrigerated means more local people are turning to dairy farming. At Munene Njoka’s three-acre farm in Kanjau village in central Kenya, he is cutting his maize crop even though harvest time is three weeks away. The reason? The five cows in his barn. Njoka chops the maize into pieces then mixes it with dry Napier grass to make silage, a delicacy that he said makes his cows more productive. Njoka, who learned the technique during a farmers’ field day, has no concerns about feeding his entire maize crop to his cows. Doing so, he said, brings in more money. “A single cow used to give me about eight litres of milk in a day before I learned about silage,” the father of two said. “Now I can get as much as 20 litres from a single cow.” That brings in 100,000 Kenyan shillings ($1,000) a month, he said. It beats growing maize to feed his family, he said, because if the rains fail then the crop will wither leaving him nursing a financial loss and stuck in an cycle of hunger. “After investing part of the money back to the farm, buying food, paying school fees and health bills, I still have enough to take my family out during weekends,” said Njoka. That echoes Kamuru’s experience: for him, keeping dairy cows generates more income than growing maize, in part because maize prices are kept low by cheap imports. “But milk prices are always rising due to demand from a growing urban population. This assures me of a steady income all year round,” he said. Reporting by Kagondu Njagi. Editing by Robert Carmichael and

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will hold high-level talks with India’s Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj and Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sept. 6, in what is known as a 2+2 dialogue. “Definitely we are not going to zero” (purchases), said the official, who has direct knowledge of India’s oil purchase policy and did not wish to be identified.  When asked if more clarity on India’s Iranian oil purchases would emerge after the dialogue, the official said “yes, that is the highest level of meeting we will have with the U.S.” The United States is pushing all countries to halt oil imports from Iran after President Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers and ordered a re-imposition of sanctions on Tehran. India, Iran’s top oil buyer after China, has so far not decided on the size of any cut to Iranian imports and continues to seek a waiver from the United States. Trump has threatened that anyone trading with Iran will not do business with America. U.S. sanctions on Iran’s energy sector are set to be re-imposed after a 180-day “wind-down period” ending on Nov. 4. Several countries that were involved in the 2015 nuclear deal had attempted to lessen the blow of fresh sanctions on Iran, and urged their firms not to pull out.  But that has proven difficult: several European companies have cut ties with Iran, arguing they cannot risk losing their U.S. business as the sanctions deadline approaches. India has already asked its refiners to prepare for a drastic reduction in imports of crude from Tehran from November, sources told Reuters in June. New Delhi has so far not committed to complying fully with the new U.S. sanctions, but is prepared to cut Iran oil imports to protect its wider exposure to the U.S. financial system. During the previous round of sanctions, India was one of the few countries that continued to buy Iranian oil, although it had to reduce imports as shipping, insurance and banking channels were choked off due to the European and U.S. sanctions.

2018-08-29,"STAVANGER, Norway (Reuters) - Norway’s Equinor (EQNR.OL) will invest up to $15 billion (11.64 billion pounds) in Brazil over the next 12 years to develop oil, gas and renewable energy sources, the company said on Wednesday. Coinciding with an expected drop in output from many ageing oilfields off the cost of Norway, Brazil is expected to become a core region for Equinor as the firm takes advantage of the country’s opening in recent years to more foreign investment. The company plans to raise its Brazilian output to between 300,000 and 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) by 2030, from 90,000 boepd today by developing new fields, including the giant Carcara discovery. “Brazil is a perfect match for Equinor with our operational, technical competence that we have built over decades on the Norwegian continental shelf,” said Anders Opedal, Equinor’s head of operations in the South American country. The Norwegian oil and gas company has already invested around $10 billion in Brazil since 2001, acquiring stakes in a variety of discoveries and fields.  Carcara, estimated to hold similar volumes of oil as Norway’s 2.2 billion-3.2 billion barrels Johan Sverdrup discovery, is expected to start production in 2023-24, making it the first time a foreign firm operates a so-called pre-salt field. “We call Carcara our new Johan Sverdrup ... Our portfolio in Brazil will have high value, we see very good break-evens,” Opedal said, referring to the oil price levels at which Equinor expects to earn a profit. The Equinor-operated Peregrino II development is on track to start production at the end of 2020, with its break-even price reduced to below $40 a barrel versus the original estimate of $70, he added. Equinor last year took a 25 percent stake in the Roncador field, aiming to boost output by around 500 million barrels over the lifetime of production, equivalent to the size of Equinor’s Johan Castberg field in the Barents Sea. The Norwegian company now plans a multi-year drilling campaign to firm up its Brazilian resources, exploration chief Tim Dodson told Reuters on the sidelines of an energy conference. “You need to go 30-40 years back in Norway to see the same opportunities ... We are talking about giant discoveries with standalone installations. There’s still huge upside remaining,” he said of the outlook for Brazil’s oil production. The company also said it would seek more opportunities to invest in solar power in Brazil after making a first investment in the Apodi project last year, and will seek to supply natural gas to the local market.

2018-08-29,"FALLUJA, Iraq (Reuters) - At least eight people were killed and 12 wounded in a suicide car-bomb attack on a security checkpoint in western Iraq, the local mayor said on Wednesday. The attacker drove a car rigged with explosives into the checkpoint in Qaim district, which was jointly manned by the army and Shi’ite militias, Mayor Ahmed al-Mehlawy told Reuters. Five militiamen and three civilians were killed, Mehlawy said. Some of the wounded were in a critical condition, he said. The Iraqi military put the initial death toll at seven.     “Security forces in the Qaim district noticed a suspect Kia vehicle and shot at it after it turned out to be rigged and driven by a suicidal terrorist, which led to its explosion and the death of seven people, including four from the security forces and three civilians,” the military said in a statement. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack and said it killed 28 people, contradicting the official death tolls. Iraq declared victory over Islamic State in December, dislodging the group from all the territory it held after its self-proclaimed caliphate, which also encompassed part of Syria, collapsed earlier in 2017. Security forces retook Qaim, which lies 300 km (185 miles) west of Baghdad in the Sunni province of Anbar, on the border with Syria, in November. It was one of the last remaining territories in the country held by Islamic State. The group’s fighters have since then waged a campaign of kidnappings and killings.

Talks to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) hinge on Canada after Monday’s deal between the United States and Mexico.  MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.39 percent .MIWD00000PUS while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq U.S. stock indexes hit all-time highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 60.55 points, or 0.23 percent, to 26,124.57, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 16.52 points, or 0.57 percent, to 2,914.04, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 79.65 points, or 0.99 percent, to 8,109.69. [.N] Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said investor optimism was tinged with caution. He noted the difficulty of predicting U.S. trade negotiations, which could make markets choppy. “It is an erratic rally,” he said. “We need a bit more fuel to the fire.” U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to proceed with Mexico alone and levy tariffs on Canada if it did not come on board with revised trade terms for NAFTA. But a trade deal without Canada might not win approval from the U.S. Congress because such a deal would have to pass a higher bar. “The final decisions are unlikely until 2019 at the earliest,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note to clients. But on Wednesday, at least, familiar leaders from the long bull-market run resumed their leadership role. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) all hit record intraday highs and helped lift Wall Street indexes. The dollar, which has been a safe haven from trade concerns, turned negative after early gains. The dollar index .DXY, which measures the U.S. currency against several trading partners, fell 0.18 percent. The Mexican peso MXN= gained 0.59 percent versus the greenback, while the Canadian dollar CAD= rose 0.17 percent. Elsewhere in the global trade conflict, a deadline for public comment on Trump’s increased tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods was less than a week away on Sept. 5. The White House has said it wants to settle NAFTA before negotiating with China. “There’s a big debate taking place among investors: Is Trump hoping to reach agreement with all the big players to demonstrate what a successful negotiator he is, or is he trying to make sure he’s got agreement with NAFTA and the EU and therefore can turn all the firepower on to China?” said Aberdeen Standard’s Milligan. Emerging market stocks .MSCIEF rose 0.07 percent, but remained under pressure from weakening currencies. An index of those countries’ currencies .MIEM00000CUS fell 0.3 percent in dollar terms. Turkey's lira TRY= extended losses, down about 3 percent against the dollar, a two-week low, as concern grew about the effects of the country's currency crisis. Finance Minister Berat Albayrak was quoted as saying he did not see a risk to the economy. Dollar-denominated Turkish bank bonds also fell after Moody’s sounded the alarm over the sector. Argentina's peso ARS= collapsed more than 7 percent to a record low of 33.9 per U.S. dollar on Wednesday, prompting the central bank to sell dollar reserves for a second straight day while the President Mauricio Macri asked the International Monetary Fund for early release of funds under a standby deal. Oil prices shot higher, supported by news of falling Iranian crude shipments as U.S. sanctions deterred buyers.

2018-08-29,"HOUSTON, Aug 29 (Reuters) - U.S. oil producer Magnolia Oil & Gas Corp aims to at least triple in market valuation in coming years as it develops shale acreage across eastern and southern Texas, Chief Executive Steve Chazen said on Wednesday. Magnolia’s shares have rallied about 33 percent this year alongside a rise in crude prices and as the company has focused on shareholder returns amidst rising pressure from Wall Street on the sector. The company, formed earlier this year by private equity firm TPG Capital and Chazen, the former Occidental Petroleum CEO, has been amassing acreage across the oil-rich Eagle Ford shale formation and the Austin Chalk limestone and clay formation. “The oil industry is about money, not about romance,” Chazen said in an interview. “Our model is to live within cash flow.” Magnolia’s market valuation of $3.24 billion likely could grow to between $10 billion to $12 billion in coming years, Chazen said, adding that such a level would be a manageable size to oversee as CEO. Chazen declined to comment on when that level could be reached, but the company expects to double in size without acquisitions within five years. “Our end game is to build our company to a rational size, and if we continue to grow and generate excess cash flow, to return cash to shareholders,” he said. Magnolia, which pumps more than 46,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, invests less than 60 percent of its cash flow into drilling and other operations, saving the rest for growth opportunities and other uses. The Austin Chalk, which lies atop the Eagle Ford in parts of Texas, is undergoing a renaissance of sorts as oil producers, Magnolia included, deploy technology developed in the shale boom. Magnolia, which operates more than 360,000 acres, added to its holdings in the area earlier this month in a $200 million cash-and-stock purchase of acreage from privately held Harvest Oil & Gas. Production from the Austin Chalk jumped to 57,000 barrels per day (bpd) last year from 3,000 bpd five years ago, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie, which expects the production gains to continue. Unlike some rivals, Magnolia has not invested in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield. Chazen’s former company, Occidental, is the Permian’s largest oil producer, but that company bought much of its acreage years ago before land prices spiked. “New entrants in the Permian have a less-privileged position because they have to pay a lot to get there,” Chazen said. “The Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk are less popular, but the acreage costs are more reasonable.” (Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Richard Chang)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/magnolia-oil-growth/u-s-shale-producer-magnolia-eyes-tripling-in-size-idUKL2N1VK19I,29 Aug 2018,"U.S. oil producer Magnolia Oil &

2018-08-29,"(Adds presidency comment) * Bill sent back to lawmakers * Contested part covers state oil company governance * Bill would curb president’s power to award contracts * Reform key to reviving investment By Paul Carsten ABUJA, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s presidency rebuffed a landmark oil industry reform law because of issues with its current form, the executive said on Wednesday, marking a setback for plans to reinvigorate investment in Africa’s largest crude producing nation. The presidency said it had sent the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill (PIGB), dealing in part with the management of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, back to the National Assembly last month. This legislation forms a section of the broader Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB). Part of the presidency’s disagreement with lawmakers is the fact that the bill would reduce the power of the president and oil minister to oversee and award oil licences and contracts, said a person with knowledge of the matter. President Muhammadu Buhari is also the Nigerian oil minister. The PIGB was returned to parliament at the end of July partly because it allowed a regulatory body to take 10 percent of oil revenues, to the detriment of federal, state and local governments, said Ita Enang, a presidency official who liaises with the legislature. Provisions such as the expanded remit of an oil fund and others that created conflicts in interpretation or ambiguity were also partly the reason why the bill was not fit for presidential assent, Enang said in a statement. The head of the upper house of parliament’s committee on upstream petroleum was not immediately available for comment. The governance bill would create four new entities whose powers would include the ability to conduct bid rounds, award exploration licences and make recommendations to the oil minister on upstream licences. Both houses of parliament passed the governance bill in January but it still needed the president’s signature to become law. Senate President Bukola Saraki told Reuters in May that it had been transferred to the presidency, but a person familiar with the matter said it was not sent until July when parliament had intended to have all the PIB sections passed. Parliament has so far passed only the governance section of the bill, after it was broken down into sections to try to accelerate its passage. When Buhari came to power in 2015, passage of the PIB was seen as “critical for the revival of investments into the sector”, according to a presidential report from the time seen by Reuters. The administration’s plan had been to pass the PIB within 100 days of taking power, according to the report, which noted that “uncertainties over the fiscal terms from an unapproved PIB” were a key issue in Nigeria’s oil sector.

2018-08-29,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose more than 1 percent on Wednesday, with Brent at its highest in seven weeks and U.S. crude touching a three-week peak, supported by a drawdown in U.S. crude and gasoline stocks and reduced Iranian crude shipments as U.S. sanctions deter buyers. Brent crude LCOc1 jumped $1.19, or 1.6 percent, to settle at $77.14, after touching $77.41, its highest since July 11. U.S. oil CLc1 settled 98 cents, or 1.4 percent higher at $69.51 a barrel, after touching $69.75, its highest since Aug. 7.  U.S. crude inventories USOILC=ECI fell 2.6 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said, exceeding the 686,000-barrel draw forecast by analysts polled by Reuters. [EIA/S] “Crude oil got additional support today from the declining inventories across the board,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. Declining Iranian exports and reduced exports from Venezuela due to terminal damage also lent support to the price, he said.  U.S. crude’s discount to Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1 retreated slightly from the more than 10-week high hit Tuesday. Oil prices were buoyed by indications that Iranian crude exports were falling faster than previously expected, analysts said.    Iran’s crude oil and condensate exports in August are set to drop below 70 million barrels for the first time since April 2017, preliminary trade flows data on Thomson Reuters Eikon show. Many crude buyers have reduced orders from Iran, OPEC’s third-biggest producer, ahead of the Nov. 4 start date for U.S. sanctions. The head of Iraqi state oil producer SOMO said on Wednesday that the sanctions will prompt a crude shortage, and that OPEC will discuss compensating for the supply drop.  (Graphic: Average Iranian crude exports by month: reut.rs/2LClnmH) (Graphic: Iran crude oil exports from Jan 2016 to August 2018: reut.rs/2PGtjqB) In Venezuela, where production has halved since 2016, the state-run oil firm PDVSA said on Tuesday it had signed a $430 million investment agreement to increase production by 640,000 bpd, although some analysts doubted whether this investment would go through given ongoing instability. Meanwhile, the preliminary export plan for fellow OPEC member Angola indicates that its shipments have dropped to the lowest level since December 2006, as a lack of investment in ageing infrastructure limits production. Despite the risk of disruption from these OPEC producers, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said global supply could climb toward the end of the year, in part due to increased non-OPEC output from Canada, the United States and Brazil.  Norway’s Equinor (EQNR.OL) said it plans to develop new oil fields in Brazil and raise output from 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to between 300,000 and 500,000 boepd by 2030.

2018-08-29,"ABUJA, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s economy is expected to perform much better in the second half of the year, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo said on Wednesday, following sluggish growth in the second quarter. Largely dependent on its oil reserves, Nigeria began climbing out of its first recession in 25 years in 2016 as global crude prices rebounded and President Muhammadu Buhari’s government implemented the early stages of a turnaround plan. But the recovery has been relatively slow, and since the beginning of this year the pace has started to dip as the oil sector again struggles. “We expect to see the growth figures doing much better,” Osinbajo told reporters after the statistics office had released the April-June figures earlier this week. “What you are seeing today is a snapshot but if you look at the long term, clearly we are going to be doing much better,” he said, adding that a micro-credit programme for 2 million traders should begin to bear fruit in the coming months. The pace of economic recovery has been a sore point since Buhari took power in 2015 on promises to rejuvenate Africa’s largest oil producer. Flagging growth could spell trouble for Buhari as he seeks re-election in early 2019. The vice president, however, said he expects a turnaround. “We’re very optimistic and we’re going to power into the next year,” Osinbajo said.

Still, familiar leaders from this long bull market run resumed their leadership role, with Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp among those lifting Wall Street indexes higher. The dollar, which has been a safe haven from trade concerns, turned negative after early gains. An index of the U.S. currency against several trading partners fell 0.12 percent. The Mexican peso gained 0.44 percent versus the greenback, while the Canadian dollar rose 0.05 percent. Elsewhere in the global trade conflict, a deadline for public comment on Trump’s increased tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods was less than a week away on Sept. 5. The White House has said it wants to settle NAFTA before negotiating with China. “There’s a big debate taking place among investors: is Trump hoping to reach agreement with all the big players to demonstrate what a successful negotiator he is, or is he trying to make sure he’s got agreement with NAFTA and the EU and therefore can turn all the firepower on to China?” said Milligan. Emerging market stocks rose 0.10 percent, but remained under pressure from weakening currencies. An index of those countries’ currencies fell 0.29 percent in dollar terms. Turkey’s lira extended losses, down 2.08 percent against the dollar, a two-week low, as concern grew about the effects of the country’s currency crisis, and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak was quoted as saying he did not see a risk to the economy. Dollar-denominated Turkish bank bonds also fell after Moody’s sounded the alarm over the sector. Oil prices rose about 1 percent, supported by a drawdown in U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles and news of falling Iranian crude shipments as U.S. sanctions deterred buyers. U.S. crude rose 1.31 percent to $69.43 per barrel and Brent was last at $77.03, up 1.42 percent on the day. Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Additional reporting by Wayne

2018-08-29,"(Adds quotes from CEO, commissioner and vice president, context) By Wilda Asmarini JAKARTA, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Indonesia’s government on Wednesday confirmed Nicke Widyawati as the permanent chief executive of Pertamina and picked a new  upstream director amid pressure on the state-owned energy firm to curb imports, boost refining capacity and biodiesel use. Widyawati became the acting chief executive officer (CEO) in April after Elia Massa Manik was fired after repeated clashes with the government over fuel price controls, criticism over his handling of an oil spill and for failing to meet mandates on fuel sales. Widyawati, a former human resources director at the company, is the third CEO at Pertamina in just three years. “There are three mandates from the government - reduce imports, start development of refineries and implement the B20 biodiesel project,” Widyawati told reporters at a press conference at the State-Owned Enterprises Ministry after her appointment by Indonesian President Joko Widodo. The B20 project starting next month will require all diesel fuel to contain at least 20 percent biocontent, typically palm oil, to boost palm oil consumption, slash fuel imports, and narrow a yawning current account gap. Indonesia, one of Southeast Asia’s biggest fuel importers, also aims to reduce its import bill by improving its ageing domestic refineries, but some projects have been delayed because of financing issues. The government also appointed Dharmawan Samsu, the country head of BP Plc’s Indonesia unit, as Pertamina’s upstream director. Indonesia was once a major crude oil producer and exporter, and a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, with output reaching more than 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in 1995. Since then, the international oil majors that had dominated the country’s oil development have scaled back their operations because of uncertainty around regulations. The lack of investment in new reserves and rising fuel demand has caused Indonesia to become a net oil importer. Pertamina is due in 2021 take over as operator of the Rokan block, Indonesia’s second-largest oilfield, from Chevron , though production is falling. Tanri Abeng, Pertamina’s president commissioner, told reporters that Samsu was appointed because there was a need for someone with experience from a multinational. “Blocks that have been given to Pertamina are not easy, very difficult tasks but also an opportunity for us. We will be able to increase our production which is only about a third of the domestic output,” said Abeng. Pertamina said this week it aims to lift overall oil output to 407,000 bpd in 2019, up from 2018’s goal of 400,000 bpd. Abeng urged the government not to keep shaking up management at Pertamina, which faces frequent interference from the government due to its importance on the economy, particularly at a time when the rupiah currency is under pressure.

2018-08-29,"(Repeats column with no changes to text. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2LyoJY3 By John Kemp LONDON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers continued to liquidate their bullish positions in crude and fuels, amid negative sentiment towards petroleum, before prices rallied sharply in the second half of last week. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by another 49 million barrels in the week to Aug. 20. Fund managers have reduced their net long position in 13 of the last 18 weeks, by a total of 508 million barrels (36 percent), according to an analysis of records published by regulators and exchanges. Total long positions have been slashed by 494 million barrels, while short positions have increased by 14 million barrels, since April 17 (tmsnrt.rs/2LyoJY3). As a result, portfolio managers’ combined net long position in petroleum has been cut to just 903 million barrels, the lowest for almost a year. And the ratio of long to short positions has fallen from almost 14:1 to just over 8:1, leaving the market looking much less lopsided than before. The most recent week saw continued liquidation of net length in Brent (-12 million barrels), NYMEX and ICE WTI (-16 million), U.S. gasoline (-10 million), U.S. heating oil (-6 million) and European gasoil (-5 million). As in previous weeks, most of the changes came from the long side of the market, with fund managers trimming old bullish long positions rather than adding new bearish short ones. But there was a notable increase of 15 million barrels in short WTI positions on NYMEX, the largest one-week rise for 10 months. Negative sentiment among fund managers up to and including Tuesday last week, the cut-off date for the commitments’ of traders reports, likely created the conditions for a strong bounce later in the week. But benchmark Brent prices have traded sideways in a range between $70 and $80 for the four months since April, after rallying strongly over the preceding nine months. Prices are caught in the cross-current between fears about a supply-crunch as a result of the re-imposition of Iran sanctions and a potential hit to demand as a result of a slowdown in global growth. Until one, or both, those sources of uncertainty are resolved, prices seem set to remain rangebound.

2018-08-29,"* U.S. sanctions to target Iran’s oil sector from November * Oil buyers already scaling back orders from Iran * But non-OPEC crude supply to rise -BoAML By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Oil markets were stable on Wednesday, buoyed by falling supplies from Iran ahead of U.S. sanctions but held in check by rising production outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. International Brent crude oil futures were at $76 per barrel at 0030 GMT, up 5 cents from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 6 cents at $68.59 a barrel. Traders said crude prices have been supported by the prospect of U.S. sanctions against Iran, which will start to target its oil industry from November. Bowing to pressure from Washington, many crude buyers have already reduced orders from OPEC’s third-biggest producer. Despite Tehran offering steep discounts, the total volume of crude oil, including condensate, to load in Iran this month is estimated at 64 million barrels, or 2.06 million barrels per day (bpd), versus a peak of 92.8 million barrels, or 3.09 million bpd, in April, preliminary trade flows data on Thomson Reuters Eikon showed. RISING NON-OPEC SUPPLY Despite the risk of disruption especially from OPEC-countries like Venezuela, Iran, Libya and Nigeria, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said global supply could climb towards year-end. “Heading into 4Q18, we expect rising non-OPEC oil production as supply outages abate and greenfield projects ramp up,” the U.S. bank said in a note to clients. “Currently, non-OPEC supply outages are at a 15-month high of 730,000 barrels per day. However, nearly half of these volumes are in the process of being restored,” it said. Adding to that will be new production in Canada, Brazil and from the United States, which the bank said “should provide a substantial boost to non-OPEC supplies” during the second-half of the year “taming upside pressures on Brent crude oil prices”. Bank of America said it expected Brent prices to be in a $65 to $80 per barrel range “until Iran sanctions start to bite” in the first-half of 2019. Reporting by Henning Gloystein

2018-08-29,"(Repeats item issued late Tuesday, with no change to text) * Iran oil loadings set to drop below 70 mln bbls in Aug - data * First time loadings have dropped below that level since April 2017 - data * Iran heavy crude OSP at biggest discount to Saudi oil in Sept - data By Florence Tan SINGAPORE, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Iran’s crude oil and condensate exports in August are set to drop below 70 million barrels for the first time since April 2017, well ahead of the Nov. 4 start date for a second round of U.S. economic sanctions. The United States has asked buyers of Iranian oil to cut imports to zero starting in November to force Tehran to negotiate a new nuclear agreement and to curb its influence in the Middle East. The total volume of crude and condensate, an ultra-light oil produced from natural gas fields, to load in Iran this month is estimated at 64 million barrels, or 2.06 million barrels per day (bpd), versus a peak of 92.8 million barrels, or 3.09 million bpd, in April, preliminary trade flows data on Thomson Reuters Eikon showed. The National Iranian Oil Co has slashed its crude prices to keep buyer interest amid the August export drop. It has set the official selling price (OSP) for Iranian Heavy crude for September loading at the biggest discount since 2004, according to Reuters and trade data. Iran is currently the third-largest producer among the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and benchmark oil futures traded in London have surged to their highest since June in anticipation of the loss of Iranian supply. Imports by its key customers have all dropped in August as some buyers, banks and insurance companies have already suspended dealings in Iranian oil. Loadings bound for top customer China are set to fall to 18.4 million barrels in August, from 24 million barrels in July which was its highest monthly volume this year, the data showed. China has switched to using Iranian tankers to deliver the country’s crude since July to side-step the sanctions and sustain Iranian oil imports until at least October. The volume of oil heading to India is 8.2 million barrels, down from more than 20 million barrels in each month since April. Exports to India could still rise as the destination for about 11 million barrels of Iranian oil loading this month are yet to be identified. Japan-bound loadings have been scaled back to 3.4 million barrels in August, down for a second straight month. Japanese refiners are expected to load their last Iranian oil by mid-September so they will arrive in Japan before November. Iran has not loaded any oil bound for South Korea since July. Cargoes loading for Europe have been falling from a peak of 22.2 million barrels in March down to about 12 million barrels in August, the data showed. European companies such as France’s Total are walking away from Iran for fear of triggering U.S. sanctions although Iran’s president has urged the remaining signatories to its 2015 nuclear agreement to save the pact. The United States withdrew from the agreement in May and ordered the renewed sanctions, the first of which went into effect on Aug. 7.

2018-08-29,"IN KYIN KONE, Myanmar (Reuters) - More than 50,000 people have evacuated their homes in central Myanmar after part of a dam failed on Wednesday, inundating communities and damaging a bridge on a major highway, officials said. The incident spotlights safety concerns about dams in Southeast Asia following last month’s collapse of a hydroelectric dam in neighbouring Laos that displaced thousands of people and killed at least 27. Myanmar fire authorities sent a team to the dam after the breach at 5:30 a.m. (2300 GMT) unleashed water into the nearby town of Swar and several other settlements. “The (spillway) of the dam was broken and flooded the two villages close to the highway,” the fire department said on its Facebook page.  Authorities had given the dam the all-clear after an inspection just days earlier, despite residents’ concerns about overspill, state-run media said. “If you go to my house, there are no belongings left,” said farmer Aung Aung, whose village of Kone Gyi Lan Sone was inundated without warning, sending him scrambling to tell his neighbours. They all ran to higher ground to escape. “It was only after that we realised the situation,” he told Reuters. “The little shop over there is completely destroyed and washed away,” he added, as floodwaters and broken branches swirled around the wooden homes in the village. Many people, including some not directly hit by flooding, had decided to leave their homes for fear the waters could rise further, said an official of the Natural Disaster Management Department who sought anonymity, in the absence of authorisation to speak to media. As many as 14 clusters of hamlets were battling flooding, the department said.     In all, 12,000 households, or a total of 54,000 people, were displaced, said another official, from the Department of Relief and Resettlement, who also declined to be named.     A surge of water as high as 8 feet (2.4 m) hit the first downstream village of Kyun Taw Su, besides flooding Swar and part of the larger town of Yedashe, said Ko Lwin, a journalist based in Swar.  A Yedashe administrative official said authorities could not rule out that people were still trapped in small villages near the dam, adding that of three people reported missing and feared  swept away by the waters, one was found alive. “The two other people are still missing,” said the official, Aye Myin Kyi. “We don’t assume them dead, we are still looking for them.”  About 7,000 people were staying in 17 camps in the town, she added, while 16 more held 3,500 people in Taungoo, the nearest major town, with still more in monasteries and elsewhere.  Pictures on social media showed soldiers using makeshift bamboo rafts and kayaks to evacuate people from flooded homes and shops, some carrying children and the elderly through knee-deep waters. The waters had begun to subside on Wednesday afternoon but still rushed beneath a damaged bridge along the road linking Myanmar’s major cities of Yangon, Mandalay and the capital Naypyitaw surrounded by acres of flooded fields.  The bridge stayed closed to heavy traffic as the carriageway for vehicles travelling north to south had buckled.   “When the water flooded the bridge we closed it, and by the time we arrived here around 8 a.m., two columns had sunk around two feet,” said Deputy Minister of Construction Kyaw Linn, who joined in repair work by surveyors and workers. Myanmar’s heavy annual monsoon rains have caused widespread flooding that displaced more than 100,000 people and killed at least 11 in July.  Some dams were reported to be overflowing this month, but an irrigation and water management official told the privately-run Myanmar Times newspaper there was no risk of a collapse. The dam built across the Swar creek in 2004 can hold 216,350 acre-feet of water to irrigate more than 20,000 acres (8,100 hectares) of farmland, says a Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation document posted online. Swar residents had expressed concerns that the dam was overflowing, said Ko Lwin, the journalist. On Monday, the state-run Myanmar Alin newspaper said an administrator and an irrigation official had inspected the dam. “There is nothing to be concerned about,” it reported the administrator, Tun Nay Aung, as saying, as the dam had not exceeded its capacity.  Reuters was unable to trace contact details for Tun Nay Aung on Wednesday. Government spokesman Zaw Htay did not answer telephone calls from Reuters to seek comment regarding the prior concerns over the dam. The Myanmar government is assessing some dam projects to help eliminate chronic power shortages, but their potential environmental impact makes the projects controversial.    Large areas were still cut off by the floods, said Aye Aye, 47, one of the relief providers in the Swar area. “I don’t know about all the people,” she added. “But there were quite a lot of dogs. Motorcycles were also underwater. (We saw) dead buffaloes, dead cows.” Additional reporting by Aye Min Thant, Sam Aung Moon, Thu Thu Aung and Simon Lewis; Editing by Michael Perry and Clarence Fernandez",https://uk.reuters.com/article/myanmar-dam/update-3-more-than-50000-evacuated-in-myanmar-as-homes-shops-flooded-after-dam-fails-idUKL3N1VK29D,29 Aug 2018,"* At least two people missing after being swept away

Talks to renew a NAFTA trade agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada - after Monday’s U.S.-Mexico deal - hinge on Canada. Uncertainty over when a final agreement might pass the U.S. Congress also kept trade muted. MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, eased 0.1 percent from the 5-1/2-month high hit after Mexico and the United States struck their deal. “The market is quite right to say after the knee-jerk reaction higher in the Mexican peso and equities, a) there was remarkably little detail, and b) what is the state of Canada?” Aberdeen Standard Investments head of global strategy Andrew Milligan said. “It helps this rebound in risk assets we’re seeing but it is an erratic rally because we need a bit more fuel to the fire,” he said. U.S. stocks were set for a cautious open with eMini futures for the S&P 500 giving back gains to trade flat while Dow Jones futures fell 0.1 percent. European stocks drifted either side of flat, with the index of top 50 companies down 0.02 percent by 1247 GMT. U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to proceed with Mexico alone and levy tariffs on Canada if it does not come on board with revised trade terms. But a trade deal might struggle to win approval from Congress unless Canada comes on board. “The final decisions are unlikely until 2019 at the earliest,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note to clients, saying that control of the majority in Congress might have gone to the Democrats by then, which could make agreement more difficult. Currencies reflected investors’ lingering uncertainty. Against the U.S. dollar, the Canadian dollar fell 0.1 percent while Mexico’s peso declined 0.3 percent. European autos stocks also slid 0.3 percent as details of the agreement on autos emerged. Auto executives and sources told Reuters a side agreement would allow the U.S. to slap punitive tariffs of up to 25 percent on imports of Mexican-made cars, sport utility vehicles and auto parts above certain volumes. On another front of the global trade conflicts, a deadline for public comment on Trump’s increased tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods was less than a week away on Sept. 5. “End-of-month flows could start to take hold into the end of the week, and combined with light news flow and the risk of impending trade war escalation could result in conviction remaining light,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note. The White House has said it wants to settle NAFTA before negotiating with China, suggesting trade disputes will run well into 2019. “There’s a big debate taking place among investors: is Trump hoping to reach agreement with all the big players to demonstrate what a successful negotiator he is, or is he trying to make sure he’s got agreement with NAFTA and the EU and therefore can turn all the firepower on to China?” Milligan said. Major currencies quietened down after a turbulent few days, with the dollar index 0.2 percent firmer at 94.887 after touching a four-week low overnight. The euro eased to $1.1661 after hitting a one-month high at $1.1733 overnight. The currency’s gains are being capped by concerns over Italy’s budget. “We believe that Italy is headed on a collision course with the EU as the two meet to discuss Italy’s budget in September,” Man Group portfolio managers wrote in a note. But peripheral euro zone bond markets recovered slightly. Italy’s 10-year and 2-year bond yields fell on media reports that Italy may ask the European Central Bank for new bond purchasing. Emerging market stocks came under renewed pressure, falling 0.2 percent as the dollar rose. Turkey’s lira extended losses, down 3.2 percent to 6.45 to the dollar, a two-week low, concern grew about the effects of the country’s currency crisis, and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak was quoted as saying he did not see a risk to the economy. Dollar-denominated Turkish bank bonds also fell after Moody’s sounded the alarm over the sector. Overall, emerging markets have clawed back from this month’s sharp sell-off. “On balance people are looking to buy EM assets but it would be foolish to say buy them all because there are still vulnerabilities in a sizeable number,” Aberdeen Standard’s Milligan said. In commodity markets, spot gold rose 0.2 percent to $1,203.34 an ounce. Oil prices extended gains on news of a fall in Iranian crude supplies as U.S. sanctions deter buyers. Brent gained 0.6 percent to $76.38 a barrel. U.S. crude climbed 0.7 percent to $69.00. For Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets: Reporting by Helen Reid

Lukoil, controlled by Vagit Alekperov and his deputy Leonid Fedun, said its earnings were supported by higher sales despite a decline in oil production after a global oil deal to curb output. Shares were up 1.3 percent by 1228 GMT, outperforming the broader Moscow market, which climbed by 0.8 percent. Sales in the second quarter increased to 2.06 trillion roubles, from 1.36 trillion roubles a year earlier.

2018-08-29,"LAGOS, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s state oil company plans to conduct a feasibility study for setting up two condensate refineries with a total capacity of 200,000 barrels per day (bpd), it said on Wednesday. The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said in a statement it planned to set up the condensate refineries in partnership with private partners in the southern states of Delta and Imo. Maikanti Baru, NNPC’s managing director, said the commission had received bids from companies willing to conduct the feasibility study for the NNPC. Nigeria currently has a 445,000 bpd refining system which operates well below capacity due to mismanagement and lack of investment, forcing the NNPC to import the bulk of the country’s gasoline. NNPC earlier this month said it was considering plans to establish a 100,000 bpd brownfield refinery at its Port Harcourt and Warri sites in collaboration with private sector investors. Baru said the condensate project was part of strategies aimed at eliminating imports of petroleum products and guaranteeing energy security in Nigeria. Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote, is building a 650,000 bpd refinery near Lagos, which would meet Nigeria’s current demand and also for export. NNPC will seek partners to invest in the project, Baru said, adding the initiative would increase NNPC’s refining capacity to 645,000 bpd. The state oil company could cede control in the project, he said. Legislation aimed at overhauling Nigeria’s oil industry will, when implemented, mean the NNPC will be governed by company law, which will ensure stability and transparency, Baru said. However, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters the presidency had rebuffed the landmark oil industry reform bill in its current form and sent it back to parliament over sections that deal with management of the NNPC.

2018-08-29,"(Adds code) By Kagondu Njagi KIBUMBU, Kenya, Aug 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Four years ago, Njeru Kamuru nearly quit dairy farming. But when he learned that a solar-powered milk-cooling plant was to be built in his Kenyan village, he changed his mind. Before then, Kamuru said, he struggled to sell more than half of the 12 litres of milk his brace of cows gave during their morning and evening milking sessions. Selling those six litres earned him about a dollar; the rest of the milk went to his relatives on credit or was drunk by his wife and four children. Breaking even was hard, he said, with the key problem a lack of refrigerated storage. “I could spend the whole day at the farm waiting to sell milk to my fellow village customers,” Kamuru told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in Kibumbu village in central Kenya. And if the morning’s milk supply was difficult to sell - and it was - he was at least able to pasteurize it to ensure it did not go off. The evening’s milk supply was trickier. “If there were no customers, it all went to waste,” he said. Others in the Kibumbu Dairy Farmers Association had the same problem, so they approached the governor of Tharaka Nithi County and demanded that he honour a 2012 campaign pledge to construct a milk-cooling plant. In 2015, the solar-powered facility opened, using county funds. These days, Kamuru no longer sells milk to the villagers. His family uses two litres a day, while the rest goes to the community-owned plant. “The amount I deliver is recorded every day, and then I am paid at the end of the month,” he said. Kenyans often struggle with the country’s unreliable electricity supply, with the problem particularly acute in rural areas. For the country’s dairy farmers - who, according to the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), have 3.2 million head of dairy cattle - it’s a particular problem. Kibumbu’s solar milk-cooling plant ensures that farmers like Kamuru can store their milk safely, day or night, without it going off. The timing is good: demand for dairy products is rising fast, particularly in rapidly growing urban areas, according to the Kenya Livestock Producers Association (KLPA). “This means that farmers must have access to storage facilities that work around the 24-hour clock without interruption,” said Patrick Kimani, who heads the KLPA. “Solar-powered milk coolers provide such a solution.” Typically, local governments pay for milk-cooling plants, then hand over ownership to dairy associations, Tharaka Nithi County Governor Muthomi Njuki said in a phone interview. It is then the responsibility of the farmers to pay for maintenance, Njuki added. The Tharaka Nithi facility does that by deducting 10 percent of each farmer’s monthly earnings. Apart from being community-owned, the KLPA’s Kimani said, solar milk-cooling plants are cheap to maintain and can deal with the blackouts that continue to trouble Kenya. The dairy industry is an important part of Kenya’s economy, worth about 3.5 percent of GDP, the FAO estimates, with about 2 million people directly or indirectly working in it. Kimani said the country has about one million dairy farmers, but just 15 percent can connect to the national electricity grid to refrigerate their milk. Some of the rest rely on one of 50 solar cooling plants set up in 10 counties since 2014, Kimani said. With the cost of solar technology falling, he added, building more plants will become increasingly affordable in coming years to help Kenya’s 500-plus dairy associations. With demand for dairy products climbing, Kimani said, there are plans for plants in key production areas to boost their capacity to process milk into products such as yoghurt and milk powder. At the office of the Kibumbu Dairy Farmers Association, manager Lucy Muthoni divides her day between monitoring the milk containers that farmers bring in, and checking that the solar system on the plant’s roof is keeping the coolers humming. The plant receives more than 5,000 litres of milk a day, she said, with about one-third consumed by people in nearby Chuka town and the rest sent to the capital, Nairobi, for processing. Solar power and milk make for a good combination, she said. “Milk is most likely to go bad when the day is hot. Yet it is when it is hot that the solar system can absorb and store more energy to keep the coolers operating during the day and at night,” Muthoni told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. And, she added, the fact that milk can be refrigerated means more local people are turning to dairy farming. At Munene Njoka’s three-acre farm in Kanjau village in central Kenya, he is cutting his maize crop even though harvest time is three weeks away. The reason? The five cows in his barn. Njoka chops the maize into pieces then mixes it with dry Napier grass to make silage, a delicacy that he said makes his cows more productive. Njoka, who learned the technique during a farmers’ field day, has no concerns about feeding his entire maize crop to his cows. Doing so, he said, brings in more money. “A single cow used to give me about eight litres of milk in a day before I learned about silage,” the father of two said. “Now I can get as much as 20 litres from a single cow.” That brings in 100,000 Kenyan shillings ($1,000) a month, he said. It beats growing maize to feed his family, he said, because if the rains fail then the crop will wither leaving him nursing a financial loss and stuck in an cycle of hunger. “After investing part of the money back to the farm, buying food, paying school fees and health bills, I still have enough to take my family out during weekends,” said Njoka. That echoes Kamuru’s experience: for him, keeping dairy cows generates more income than growing maize, in part because maize prices are kept low by cheap imports. “But milk prices are always rising due to demand from a growing urban population. This assures me of a steady income all year round,” he said. Reporting by Kagondu Njagi. Editing by Robert Carmichael and

2018-08-29,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will not completely halt Iranian oil imports and will finalise its strategy on crude purchases from Tehran after a meeting with top U.S. officials next week, a senior government official said. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will hold high-level talks with India’s Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj and Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sept. 6, in what is known as a 2+2 dialogue. “Definitely we are not going to zero” (purchases), said the official, who has direct knowledge of India’s oil purchase policy and did not wish to be identified.  When asked if more clarity on India’s Iranian oil purchases would emerge after the dialogue, the official said “yes, that is the highest level of meeting we will have with the U.S.” The United States is pushing all countries to halt oil imports from Iran after President Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers and ordered a re-imposition of sanctions on Tehran. India, Iran’s top oil buyer after China, has so far not decided on the size of any cut to Iranian imports and continues to seek a waiver from the United States. Trump has threatened that anyone trading with Iran will not do business with America. U.S. sanctions on Iran’s energy sector are set to be re-imposed after a 180-day “wind-down period” ending on Nov. 4. Several countries that were involved in the 2015 nuclear deal had attempted to lessen the blow of fresh sanctions on Iran, and urged their firms not to pull out.  But that has proven difficult: several European companies have cut ties with Iran, arguing they cannot risk losing their U.S. business as the sanctions deadline approaches. India has already asked its refiners to prepare for a drastic reduction in imports of crude from Tehran from November, sources told Reuters in June. New Delhi has so far not committed to complying fully with the new U.S. sanctions, but is prepared to cut Iran oil imports to protect its wider exposure to the U.S. financial system. During the previous round of sanctions, India was one of the few countries that continued to buy Iranian oil, although it had to reduce imports as shipping, insurance and banking channels were choked off due to the European and U.S. sanctions.

2018-08-29,"STAVANGER, Norway (Reuters) - Norway’s Equinor (EQNR.OL) will invest up to $15 billion (11.64 billion pounds) in Brazil over the next 12 years to develop oil, gas and renewable energy sources, the company said on Wednesday. Coinciding with an expected drop in output from many ageing oilfields off the cost of Norway, Brazil is expected to become a core region for Equinor as the firm takes advantage of the country’s opening in recent years to more foreign investment. The company plans to raise its Brazilian output to between 300,000 and 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) by 2030, from 90,000 boepd today by developing new fields, including the giant Carcara discovery. “Brazil is a perfect match for Equinor with our operational, technical competence that we have built over decades on the Norwegian continental shelf,” said Anders Opedal, Equinor’s head of operations in the South American country. The Norwegian oil and gas company has already invested around $10 billion in Brazil since 2001, acquiring stakes in a variety of discoveries and fields.  Carcara, estimated to hold similar volumes of oil as Norway’s 2.2 billion-3.2 billion barrels Johan Sverdrup discovery, is expected to start production in 2023-24, making it the first time a foreign firm operates a so-called pre-salt field. “We call Carcara our new Johan Sverdrup ... Our portfolio in Brazil will have high value, we see very good break-evens,” Opedal said, referring to the oil price levels at which Equinor expects to earn a profit. The Equinor-operated Peregrino II development is on track to start production at the end of 2020, with its break-even price reduced to below $40 a barrel versus the original estimate of $70, he added. Equinor last year took a 25 percent stake in the Roncador field, aiming to boost output by around 500 million barrels over the lifetime of production, equivalent to the size of Equinor’s Johan Castberg field in the Barents Sea. The Norwegian company now plans a multi-year drilling campaign to firm up its Brazilian resources, exploration chief Tim Dodson told Reuters on the sidelines of an energy conference. “You need to go 30-40 years back in Norway to see the same opportunities ... We are talking about giant discoveries with standalone installations. There’s still huge upside remaining,” he said of the outlook for Brazil’s oil production. The company also said it would seek more opportunities to invest in solar power in Brazil after making a first investment in the Apodi project last year, and will seek to supply natural gas to the local market.

2018-08-29,"FALLUJA, Iraq (Reuters) - At least eight people were killed and 12 wounded in a suicide car-bomb attack on a security checkpoint in western Iraq, the local mayor said on Wednesday. The attacker drove a car rigged with explosives into the checkpoint in Qaim district, which was jointly manned by the army and Shi’ite militias, Mayor Ahmed al-Mehlawy told Reuters. Five militiamen and three civilians were killed, Mehlawy said. Some of the wounded were in a critical condition, he said. The Iraqi military put the initial death toll at seven.     “Security forces in the Qaim district noticed a suspect Kia vehicle and shot at it after it turned out to be rigged and driven by a suicidal terrorist, which led to its explosion and the death of seven people, including four from the security forces and three civilians,” the military said in a statement. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack and said it killed 28 people, contradicting the official death tolls. Iraq declared victory over Islamic State in December, dislodging the group from all the territory it held after its self-proclaimed caliphate, which also encompassed part of Syria, collapsed earlier in 2017. Security forces retook Qaim, which lies 300 km (185 miles) west of Baghdad in the Sunni province of Anbar, on the border with Syria, in November. It was one of the last remaining territories in the country held by Islamic State. The group’s fighters have since then waged a campaign of kidnappings and killings.

2018-08-29,"(Adds quotes from CEO, commissioner and vice president, context) By Wilda Asmarini JAKARTA, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Indonesia’s government on Wednesday confirmed Nicke Widyawati as the permanent chief executive of Pertamina and picked a new  upstream director amid pressure on the state-owned energy firm to curb imports, boost refining capacity and biodiesel use. Widyawati became the acting chief executive officer (CEO) in April after Elia Massa Manik was fired after repeated clashes with the government over fuel price controls, criticism over his handling of an oil spill and for failing to meet mandates on fuel sales. Widyawati, a former human resources director at the company, is the third CEO at Pertamina in just three years. “There are three mandates from the government - reduce imports, start development of refineries and implement the B20 biodiesel project,” Widyawati told reporters at a press conference at the State-Owned Enterprises Ministry after her appointment by Indonesian President Joko Widodo. The B20 project starting next month will require all diesel fuel to contain at least 20 percent biocontent, typically palm oil, to boost palm oil consumption, slash fuel imports, and narrow a yawning current account gap. Indonesia, one of Southeast Asia’s biggest fuel importers, also aims to reduce its import bill by improving its ageing domestic refineries, but some projects have been delayed because of financing issues. The government also appointed Dharmawan Samsu, the country head of BP Plc’s Indonesia unit, as Pertamina’s upstream director. Indonesia was once a major crude oil producer and exporter, and a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, with output reaching more than 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in 1995. Since then, the international oil majors that had dominated the country’s oil development have scaled back their operations because of uncertainty around regulations. The lack of investment in new reserves and rising fuel demand has caused Indonesia to become a net oil importer. Pertamina is due in 2021 take over as operator of the Rokan block, Indonesia’s second-largest oilfield, from Chevron , though production is falling. Tanri Abeng, Pertamina’s president commissioner, told reporters that Samsu was appointed because there was a need for someone with experience from a multinational. “Blocks that have been given to Pertamina are not easy, very difficult tasks but also an opportunity for us. We will be able to increase our production which is only about a third of the domestic output,” said Abeng. Pertamina said this week it aims to lift overall oil output to 407,000 bpd in 2019, up from 2018’s goal of 400,000 bpd. Abeng urged the government not to keep shaking up management at Pertamina, which faces frequent interference from the government due to its importance on the economy, particularly at a time when the rupiah currency is under pressure.

2018-08-29,"* Asia shares up marginally after Wall St finishes flat * U.S.-Mexico trade deal faces obstacles, Canada enters talks * Next deadline on China tariffs just a week away * Dollar edges up from lows, euro holds recent gains By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Asian shares crept marginally higher on Wednesday as optimism over the U.S.-Mexico trade deal was quickly clouded by caution ahead of a looming deadline on tariffs with China. A flat finish on Wall Street and a dearth of major economic data across the region made for thin trade and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eked out a rise of 0.26 percent. EMini futures for the S&P 500 edged up 0.16 percent, while Chinese blue chips dipped 0.24 percent. Japan’s Nikkei fared better than many with a rise of 0.6 percent but faced stubborn resistance around 23,000, a level where it has failed repeatedly in recent months. “For the Nikkei to break and remain above the 23,000 mark, trade conflict concerns will have to subside more convincingly,” said Hiroki Takashi, chief strategist at Monex Securities. “While recent NAFTA talks have helped, the United States and China will have to resolve their trade dispute to convincingly ease market concerns.” Analysts at JPMorgan noted the deadline for public comment on U.S. President Donald Trump’s increased tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods was less than a week away on Sept. 5. “End-of-month flows could start to take hold into the end of the week, and combined with light news flow and the risk of impending trade war escalation could result in conviction remaining light,” they cautioned. In Washington, Canada’s main trade negotiator was in talks to preserve a three-nation North American Free Trade Agreement following Monday’s deal between the United States and Mexico. President Trump warned that he could proceed with Mexico alone and levy tariffs on Canada if it does not come on board with the revised trade terms. Yet even if Trump were to go with Mexico alone, Congress would have to approve the deal in a process that would take months and put it beyond the mid-term elections. “In a nutshell it seems that many contentious issues remain unresolved and there is a very tight timeline that needs to be followed if a NAFTA deal is to be ratified by the current U.S. Congress,” NAB analysts said in a note. The White House has also said it wants to settle NAFTA before dealing with China, suggesting that trade dispute could run well into 2019. Major currencies were quiet, with the dollar index all but flat at 94.718 after touching a four-week low overnight. It was going nowhere on the yen at 111.24, having spent the past three sessions in a 110.93/111.49 range. The euro held at $1.1693 after topping out at $1.1733 overnight. It faces stiff resistance in the $1.1750/90 zone and lingering concerns over Italy where political uncertainty drove bond yields toward three-month highs. In commodity markets, spot gold was hovering around $1,203.81 after running into profit-taking at $1,214.28, its highest level since Aug. 10. Oil prices dithered either side of flat as falling supplies from Iran ahead of U.S. sanctions balanced rising production outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

2018-08-29,"(Repeats column with no changes to text. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2LyoJY3 By John Kemp LONDON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers continued to liquidate their bullish positions in crude and fuels, amid negative sentiment towards petroleum, before prices rallied sharply in the second half of last week. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by another 49 million barrels in the week to Aug. 20. Fund managers have reduced their net long position in 13 of the last 18 weeks, by a total of 508 million barrels (36 percent), according to an analysis of records published by regulators and exchanges. Total long positions have been slashed by 494 million barrels, while short positions have increased by 14 million barrels, since April 17 (tmsnrt.rs/2LyoJY3). As a result, portfolio managers’ combined net long position in petroleum has been cut to just 903 million barrels, the lowest for almost a year. And the ratio of long to short positions has fallen from almost 14:1 to just over 8:1, leaving the market looking much less lopsided than before. The most recent week saw continued liquidation of net length in Brent (-12 million barrels), NYMEX and ICE WTI (-16 million), U.S. gasoline (-10 million), U.S. heating oil (-6 million) and European gasoil (-5 million). As in previous weeks, most of the changes came from the long side of the market, with fund managers trimming old bullish long positions rather than adding new bearish short ones. But there was a notable increase of 15 million barrels in short WTI positions on NYMEX, the largest one-week rise for 10 months. Negative sentiment among fund managers up to and including Tuesday last week, the cut-off date for the commitments’ of traders reports, likely created the conditions for a strong bounce later in the week. But benchmark Brent prices have traded sideways in a range between $70 and $80 for the four months since April, after rallying strongly over the preceding nine months. Prices are caught in the cross-current between fears about a supply-crunch as a result of the re-imposition of Iran sanctions and a potential hit to demand as a result of a slowdown in global growth. Until one, or both, those sources of uncertainty are resolved, prices seem set to remain rangebound.

A flat finish on Wall Street and a dearth of major economic data across the region pointed to a quiet session ahead.

2018-08-29,"* U.S. sanctions to target Iran’s oil sector from November * Oil buyers already scaling back orders from Iran * But non-OPEC crude supply to rise -BoAML By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Oil markets were stable on Wednesday, buoyed by falling supplies from Iran ahead of U.S. sanctions but held in check by rising production outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. International Brent crude oil futures were at $76 per barrel at 0030 GMT, up 5 cents from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 6 cents at $68.59 a barrel. Traders said crude prices have been supported by the prospect of U.S. sanctions against Iran, which will start to target its oil industry from November. Bowing to pressure from Washington, many crude buyers have already reduced orders from OPEC’s third-biggest producer. Despite Tehran offering steep discounts, the total volume of crude oil, including condensate, to load in Iran this month is estimated at 64 million barrels, or 2.06 million barrels per day (bpd), versus a peak of 92.8 million barrels, or 3.09 million bpd, in April, preliminary trade flows data on Thomson Reuters Eikon showed. RISING NON-OPEC SUPPLY Despite the risk of disruption especially from OPEC-countries like Venezuela, Iran, Libya and Nigeria, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said global supply could climb towards year-end. “Heading into 4Q18, we expect rising non-OPEC oil production as supply outages abate and greenfield projects ramp up,” the U.S. bank said in a note to clients. “Currently, non-OPEC supply outages are at a 15-month high of 730,000 barrels per day. However, nearly half of these volumes are in the process of being restored,” it said. Adding to that will be new production in Canada, Brazil and from the United States, which the bank said “should provide a substantial boost to non-OPEC supplies” during the second-half of the year “taming upside pressures on Brent crude oil prices”. Bank of America said it expected Brent prices to be in a $65 to $80 per barrel range “until Iran sanctions start to bite” in the first-half of 2019. Reporting by Henning Gloystein

2018-08-29,"(Repeats item issued late Tuesday, with no change to text) * Iran oil loadings set to drop below 70 mln bbls in Aug - data * First time loadings have dropped below that level since April 2017 - data * Iran heavy crude OSP at biggest discount to Saudi oil in Sept - data By Florence Tan SINGAPORE, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Iran’s crude oil and condensate exports in August are set to drop below 70 million barrels for the first time since April 2017, well ahead of the Nov. 4 start date for a second round of U.S. economic sanctions. The United States has asked buyers of Iranian oil to cut imports to zero starting in November to force Tehran to negotiate a new nuclear agreement and to curb its influence in the Middle East. The total volume of crude and condensate, an ultra-light oil produced from natural gas fields, to load in Iran this month is estimated at 64 million barrels, or 2.06 million barrels per day (bpd), versus a peak of 92.8 million barrels, or 3.09 million bpd, in April, preliminary trade flows data on Thomson Reuters Eikon showed. The National Iranian Oil Co has slashed its crude prices to keep buyer interest amid the August export drop. It has set the official selling price (OSP) for Iranian Heavy crude for September loading at the biggest discount since 2004, according to Reuters and trade data. Iran is currently the third-largest producer among the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and benchmark oil futures traded in London have surged to their highest since June in anticipation of the loss of Iranian supply. Imports by its key customers have all dropped in August as some buyers, banks and insurance companies have already suspended dealings in Iranian oil. Loadings bound for top customer China are set to fall to 18.4 million barrels in August, from 24 million barrels in July which was its highest monthly volume this year, the data showed. China has switched to using Iranian tankers to deliver the country’s crude since July to side-step the sanctions and sustain Iranian oil imports until at least October. The volume of oil heading to India is 8.2 million barrels, down from more than 20 million barrels in each month since April. Exports to India could still rise as the destination for about 11 million barrels of Iranian oil loading this month are yet to be identified. Japan-bound loadings have been scaled back to 3.4 million barrels in August, down for a second straight month. Japanese refiners are expected to load their last Iranian oil by mid-September so they will arrive in Japan before November. Iran has not loaded any oil bound for South Korea since July. Cargoes loading for Europe have been falling from a peak of 22.2 million barrels in March down to about 12 million barrels in August, the data showed. European companies such as France’s Total are walking away from Iran for fear of triggering U.S. sanctions although Iran’s president has urged the remaining signatories to its 2015 nuclear agreement to save the pact. The United States withdrew from the agreement in May and ordered the renewed sanctions, the first of which went into effect on Aug. 7.
