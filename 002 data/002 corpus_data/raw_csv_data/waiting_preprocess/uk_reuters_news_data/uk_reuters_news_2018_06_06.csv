2018-06-06,"(Reuters) - China’s unexpected move to slash incentives for solar power has sent stocks into a free fall and prompted analysts to lower forecasts for global installations this year amid expectations that a glut of excess panels would send prices tumbling. China announced on June 1 changes to the subsidies that has underpinned its rise to become the world’s largest solar market in recent years. IHS Markit, a market research firm, was preparing to lower its global solar installation forecast for this year by between 5 and 10 gigawatts, or up to 9 percent, analyst Camron Barati said. The impact in China, which accounts for half the global market, could be up to 17 GW, the firm said. Another market research firm, Wood Mackenzie, said on Wednesday that China’s capacity additions would likely be about 20 GW lower than it had expected. An oversupply of cheap Chinese-made panels that had been destined for domestic projects will help boost demand for solar in other countries and sop up some of the demand lost in China, IHS said. But a drop in prices will leave manufacturers with razor-thin margins as they seek to unload their products. “There will be a stressful environment for pricing in the near term,” Barati said. “Something like this certainly has global ripples.” In April, IHS Markit forecast 2018 global installations would hit a record 113 GW, with 53 GW coming from China alone. China is also the world’s largest producer of solar panels. But the Asian nation last week said it would not build any more solar power stations in 2018 and cut its feed-in tariff subsidy, which guarantees a certain price for power. Solar investors reacted by selling off stocks. The MAC Global Solar index .SUNIDX is down 7 percent this week. Chinese panel makers Canadian Solar Inc (CSIQ.O), JinkoSolar Holding Co Ltd (JKS.N) and Yingli Green Energy Holding Co Ltd YGE.N have been hit, as well as U.S. panel makers SunPower Corp (SPWR.O) and First Solar Inc (FSLR.O). JMP Securities analyst Joe Osha slashed his rating on First Solar shares to “underperform” on Wednesday and cut his price target to $46 (£34.2) from $87. The Trump administration’s 30 percent tariffs on solar imports will help support prices in the United States, Osha said, but added that First Solar is seeking to do more business overseas and pricing everywhere could get very competitive. “No business is insulated from market reality,” he said.

2018-06-06,"OSLO (Reuters) - Plastic waste and toxic chemicals found in remote parts of the Antarctic this year add to evidence that pollution is spreading to the ends of the Earth, environmental group Greenpeace said on Thursday. Microplastics - tiny bits of plastic from the breakdown of everything from shopping bags to car tires - were detected in nine of 17 water samples collected off the Antarctic peninsula by a Greenpeace vessel in early 2018, it said.  And seven of nine snow samples taken on land in Antarctica found chemicals known as PFAs (polyfluorinated alkylated substances), which are used in industrial products and can harm wildlife. “We may think of the Antarctic as a remote and pristine wilderness,” Frida Bengtsson of Greenpeace’s Protect the Antarctic campaign said in a statement about the findings. “But from pollution and climate change to industrial krill fishing, humanity’s footprint is clear,” she said. “These results show that even the most remote habitats of the Antarctic are contaminated with microplastic waste and persistent hazardous chemicals.” The United Nations’ environment agency says plastic pollution has been detected from the Arctic to Antarctica and in remote places including the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the world’s oceans in the Pacific. On Tuesday, it said that less than a 10th of all the plastic ever made has been recycled, and governments should consider banning or taxing single-use bags or food containers to stem a tide of pollution. Last year researchers at the University of Hull and the British Antarctic Survey found that levels of microplastic in Antarctica were five times higher than expected only counting local sources such as research stations and ships. That means that the pollution is crossing the Southern Ocean, often considered as a barrier to man-made pollution. Scientists say the long-term impacts on marine life are unknown.   At the other end of the world, researchers in Germany reported in April that sea ice floating on the Arctic Ocean contains large amounts of plastic waste, which could be released as the ice thins because of global warming. “Plastic stays around for hundreds of years,” said author Ilka Peeken of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research. In trying to understand the spread of pollution, she told Reuters that new areas for research could include how far tiny bits of plastic are getting blown on winds to the Arctic and how much is swept by ocean currents.

2018-06-06,"(Recasts first sentence with confirmation by union and company, adds CP comment in paragraph 4) By Allison Lampert MONTREAL, June 6 (Reuters) - Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd conductors and locomotive engineers will get a 9 percent salary hike over four years as part of a tentative agreement reached last week with the Teamsters, spokesmen from both the union and CP said on Wednesday. The agreement, which must first be ratified by members to go into effect this year, would give the 3,000 workers an increase of 2 percent for the first three years and 3 percent during the last year, Teamsters Canada spokesman Chris Monette told Reuters by phone. The collective agreement replaces the workers’ previous contract which expired at the end of 2017. CP spokesman Jeremy Berry confirmed the salary hike by email and referenced an earlier company statement that said the deal would provide “long-term stability for all parties involved.” Canada’s second-largest railroad operator reached the tentative agreement with the union on May 30, ending a strike that threw industries dependent on its transportation services into disarray. The strike came at a time of tight rail capacity in Canada, with CP and rival Canadian National Railway Co facing strong demand for shipments of grain, potash and other commodities. CP, which employs 12,500, is a leading shipper of grain, crude oil and frac sand in North America. CP workers had been asking for more predictable schedules to combat crew fatigue in an industry where workers must frequently make themselves available to be on call. Monette said workers will now “have improved scheduling” because they will be able to book three 48-hour periods off a month, when they will not be on call, up from two such periods right now. Monette said the union has not yet “finalized the timeline” of a possible ratification vote.

2018-06-06,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, in yielding to pressure from farming states and agreeing to suspend changes to U.S. biofuel policy is now being criticized by another important constituency, the main union for oil refinery workers. The United Steelworkers, the largest industrial union in North America representing refinery workers, said the decision leaves in place a costly regulation that puts at risk thousands of blue collar jobs of the type Trump has promised to preserve. “Inaction by the Trump administration now threatens the livelihood of thousands of East Coast refinery workers and tens of thousands of related jobs throughout the Northeast,” the union said in a statement on Wednesday. Trump on Tuesday had told Midwestern lawmakers he would drop a proposed deal to tweak the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) to cut costs to refineries, saying he understood the move would hurt farmers, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. U.S. Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst from the farm state of Iowa, along with biofuels industry representatives in favor of the existing legislation praised Trump, and prices for U.S. renewable fuel credits soared more than 40 percent in morning trade. “With no official decision, there is more to come on this,”  said Brendan Williams, a lobbyist with merchant refiner PBF Energy Inc (PBF.N). Merchant refiners would not stop looking for help, Williams said. The White House was poised to announce proposed changes this week after hosting months of difficult negotiations between representatives of Big Oil and Big Corn. The deal would have eased pressure on the refining industry by allowing biofuels exports to count toward the annual volumes quotas, but would also have expanded sales of high-ethanol gasoline in a concession to biofuels producers. Oil refiner Pennsylvania Energy Solutions had blamed its bankruptcy this year on the cost of complying with the RFS, and other refining companies in the region have said they are also struggling to meet the requirements of the regulation - including Monroe Energy and PBF Energy. The American Petroleum Institute, which represents big oil and gas companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron Corp, said it was pleased the reform deal collapsed because it would prefer a broader “comprehensive legislative reform.” “Ethanol and oil & gas don’t see eye to eye on the RFS, but in this case we agree that it’s good news that this proposed deal collapsed,” said Frank Macchiarola, Group Director of Downstream and Industry Operations at API. The RFS requires oil refiners to mix increasing volumes of biofuels including ethanol into fuel each year, and to prove compliance by earning or acquiring blending credits and handing them in to the Environmental Protection Agency. The law has helped corn farmers by creating a 15-billion-gallon-a-year market for ethanol, but refining companies have complained that compliance costs are too high and threatens jobs. The White House and the EPA did not respond to requests on Wednesday for comment on the policy suspension.     Trump telephoned Iowa Senator Ernst on Tuesday afternoon to tell him that he would drop the plan. Trump had asked her if farmers could support the deal and she responded “no”, according to sources briefed on the phone call. He later called Grassley, one of the most vocal advocates of the U.S. biofuel industry, the sources said.  Both cheered the decision on Twitter late on Tuesday. “@realDonaldTrump has said he loooovves the farmers! #Iowa is feeling that love today, as the President just assured me he ‘won’t sign a deal that’s bad for farmers!’ Thank you Mr. President,” wrote Ernst. Trump, in a bill signing at the White House on Wednesday, appeared to give a nod to the move when he addressed Republican Ernst. “Where’s Joni? I did you a good favor for the farmers yesterday, right? We love the farmers, right Joni? Good, good, I’m glad it worked out,” he said. Pressure from merchant refiners like PBF and Valero to reform the program had already eased in recent weeks as the EPA took unilateral steps, handing out waivers to small facilities exempting them from the RFS, that resulted in  significantly lower compliance costs. Ethanol groups praised the move, but signaled that more needed to be done to rectify some of the EPA’s activities around the small refinery program and to boost use of higher ethanol blends in the marketplace. Renewable fuel credit prices are down sharply since late last year because of the EPA waivers, which biofuels advocates say have undercut ethanol demand.

2018-06-06,"MOSCOW, June 6 (Reuters) - Russia’s finance and energy ministries and its main oil companies have agreed to gradually cut oil export duties to zero over six years, two government sources told Reuters on Wednesday after a special meeting to discuss the matter. As a part of the reform, the oil export duty, which is now 30 percent, will be lowered by 5 percentage points every year till 2024, the sources said after Wednesday’s meeting. Russian officials have long been at odds over how to apply a planned new tax regime to replace oil export duties and a mineral extraction tax linked to the oil price with a single profits-based tax. A spokesman for Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak, who chaired the meeting, declined to comment. So did the finance ministry, the energy ministry, and Rosneft and Lukoil. Gazprom Neft was not available for immediate comments. Alexey Sazanov, the head of the tax department in the finance ministry, told Reuters last month that the ministry had floated a idea to lower export duty to zero over five or six years.

2018-06-06,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro rose to a nearly two-week high while the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit a 1-1/2-week peak on Wednesday after officials said the European Central Bank could wind down its stimulus programme by the end of the year. Robust growth is making the central bank increasingly confident that inflation is on its way back to target, ECB chief economist Peter Praet said on Wednesday, raising the likelihood it may use a meeting next week to reveal more about the end of its bond-buying programme. Praet's comments pushed the euro to $1.1796 EUR=, the highest level since May 22. It was last up 0.5 percent at $1.1775. The dollar index .DXY fell 0.27 percent. Jitters that the ECB would buy fewer bonds triggered a broad sell-off in German Bunds and other European government debt, which spilled over to Treasuries, analysts said. The yield on Germany’s benchmark 10-year bond DE10YT=RR rose, while the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR was up nearly 6 basis points at 2.975 percent after touching a 1-1/2 week high. “Bunds were leading the sell-off,” said John Canavan, market strategist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in New York. Praet’s comments “pulled forward the ECB move in some people’s mind.”  Higher yields helped to lift S&P 500 financials .SPSY, which rose 1.8 percent and were the biggest percentage gainer among S&P 500 sectors. Trade war fears took a back seat, boosting equities, and the Nasdaq registered its third straight record closing high. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said late in the trading day that U.S. President Donald Trump will meet French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during a G7 summit this week. While he said Trump is not backing down from the tough line he has taken on trade, the comments appeared to calm investors. “We’re seeing risk-on behaviour. Treasuries are selling off and money is flowing into equities ... the market seems to be OK with the geopolitical headwinds out there,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. Investors said the new Italian government’s big-spending plans, a major worry for markets over the last few weeks, were unlikely to be helped by the ECB tightening its own policy. Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) shares jumped, a day after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk reassured shareholders that building 5,000 of its mass-market Model 3 cars per week by the end of June was “quite likely.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 346.41 points, or 1.4 percent, to 25,146.39, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 23.55 points, or 0.86 percent, to 2,772.35 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 51.38 points, or 0.67 percent, to 7,689.24. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 0.04 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.78 percent. Oil prices fell on worries that global supply is climbing after U.S. inventories rose unexpectedly and Saudi Arabia and other big producers signalled they may raise production. U.S. crude CLcv1 fell 79 cents to settle at $64.73 a barrel, while Brent LCOcv1 dipped 2 cents to $75.36. Gold prices were steady, with spot gold XAU= flat at $1,295.80 per ounce.

2018-06-06,"VIENNA/PARIS (Reuters) - Iran will not cooperate more fully with atomic inspectors until a standoff over its nuclear deal is resolved, its U.N. envoy said, as one signatory warned Tehran against moving ahead with preparations to boost its uranium enrichment capacity. Tehran meanwhile signalled its resolve to expand its enrichment capability by detailing plans to build advanced centrifuges - the machines that enrich uranium. European powers have been scrambling to salvage the agreement they signed in 2015 since U.S. President Donald Trump pulled Washington out last month and said he would reimpose far-reaching U.S. sanctions on Iran.  Foreign and finance ministers from those three countries - France, Britain and Germany - have written to U.S. officials to stress their commitment to upholding the pact, and to urge Washington to spare EU firms active in Iran from secondary sanctions. An Iranian withdrawal from the deal, which lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, would “further unsettle a region where additional conflicts would be disastrous,” the ministers wrote in the letter dated June 4 and seen by Reuters on Wednesday. Since the U.S. pullout was announced, authorities in Tehran have sent mixed signals on whether they believe the nuclear deal’s remaining signatories, which also include China and Russia, can salvage it. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said on Monday he had ordered preparations to increase uranium enrichment capacity if the agreement collapsed.  Tehran also informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.N. nuclear watchdog that polices restrictions placed on its activities under the deal, of “tentative” plans to produce the feedstock for centrifuges.  In Paris on Wednesday, French Foreign Minister Yves Le Drian told Europe 1 radio that, while that initiative remained within the framework of the nuclear deal, it was unwelcome and risked sailing close to a “red line”. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Twitter that Washington was aware of reports Iran plans to increase its uranium enrichment and he vowed not to allow Tehran to develop a nuclear weapon. “Iran is aware of our resolve,” he said. Emphasising that Tehran’s patience with European efforts to save the deal was not unlimited, its envoy to the IAEA said it had granted the three powers a few weeks. “A few weeks means a few weeks, not a few months,” Reza Najafi said outside a quarterly meeting of the agency’s Board of Governors in Vienna. He also dismissed calls by the IAEA to go the extra mile in cooperating with the nuclear watchdog’s inspectors, telling reporters that, while the standoff over the deal continued, “no one should expect Iran to go to implement more voluntary measures.” “But I should emphasise that it does not mean that right now Iran will restart any activities contrary to the (deal),” Najafi added. “These are only preparatory works.” Iran’s nuclear chief on Wednesday inaugurated work on a facility in Natanz plant in central Iran designed to build advanced centrifuges and said the centre would be fully functional in a month. “After the supreme leader’s order we prepared this centre within 48 hours. We hope the facility to be completed in a month,” Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation, said on state television.  Although the move was not a violation of the nuclear deal, it sent a strong signal to the West that Tehran would not succumb to the pressures. Answering a question about a remark by Pompeo last month that Iran must halt all uranium enrichment, Salehi said: “We are far beyond that point. That man has been talking for himself.”   The agency has said Tehran is implementing its commitments, but also called for “timely and proactive cooperation” on providing access for snap inspections. Diplomats who deal with the agency say an inspection in late April went down to the wire in terms of how quickly the IAEA team gained access to one site.

Photos from the scene showed a destroyed car and building as well as weeping relatives of victims. An interior ministry spokesman said in a brief statement the blast was the result of the detonation of an ammunitions cache and that security forces had opened an investigation. The ammunition had been stored in a mosque and the explosion happened during its transfer into a car parked nearby, the police source said. Earlier, state television cited a ministry spokesman describing the explosion as “a terrorist aggression on civilians,” which had caused “martyrs and wounded”. Authorities did not offer an explanation of the discrepancies between the two statements, neither of which gave casualty figures.

2018-06-06,"(Reuters) - Several major U.S. operators of nuclear reactors and coal plants said they had not changed plans to close plants in coming years, even after the White House said it would take emergency steps to subsidize struggling operators.  U.S. President Donald Trump last week directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to take steps to keep coal and nuclear power plants running, citing a decades-old national security law as justification. That announcement triggered backlash from drillers, renewable energy producers and environmentalists, who call it an unfair attempt to prop up non-competitive industries and burden ratepayers with billions of dollars of additional power costs annually. NRG Energy Inc, which owns nuclear, coal and natural gas power plants, agreed.  “We’re very concerned to have consumer money subsidize plants. It’s never good when government starts picking and choosing winners and losers,” said Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG chief executive.  Exelon Corp, the country’s largest nuclear operator, has said in the past that it wants energy regulators and grid operators to find market-based solutions that would pay generators for the around-the-clock power their plants provide.  However, Exelon CEO Chris Crane said at a conference Wednesday that the power grid’s vulnerability needs to be analyzed because “if we don’t focus on resiliency and national security we could end up in a very dire situation.”  New York and Illinois, and more recently New Jersey, already provide subsidies to nuclear operators. FirstEnergy Solutions, a unit of FirstEnergy Corp, said Tuesday that it still plans to retire four reactors in coming years, along with a coal plant in Ohio, because it does not have enough information about the federal plan. The company in March called on the Trump administration to protect coal and nuclear plants.  New Jersey-based Public Service Enterprise Group Inc said it still plans to shut its last remaining coal plant in Connecticut by 2021, but will keep its nuclear plants in New Jersey operating after state subsidies were approved. Texas-based Vistra Energy Corp, which recently shut three coal plants in that state, declined comment. Power prices have fallen to record lows in many parts of the country due to cheap supplies of natural gas and increasing use of renewable energy like wind and solar, displacing costlier coal and nuclear power.  Perry in September asked federal regulators to adopt rules to protect coal and nuclear plants from early retirement. Federal energy regulators, however, rejected that plan in January.

2018-06-06,"OSLO (Reuters) - Global oil demand could peak in the early 2020s if countries pull together to hit climate goals, or keep growing until 2050 in a conflict-ridden world, according to Norwegian oil and gas firm Equinor (EQNR.OL). Expectations for when oil demand will peak could change the supply dynamics, as investors weigh up whether to back long-term projects or to reduce their risks by focusing on investments with more rapid returns, such as shale oil, it said. “An oil market in potential decline increases the uncertainty the producers face, reduces their investment horizon, and increases the focus on short payback periods for investments,” Equinor said in its new energy outlook. Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, changed its name on May 15 to reflect its strategy of becoming a “broad energy” company. It plans to increase investments in renewable energy to 15-20 percent of its total capital expenditure by 2030. Oil demand in 2050 varies between 59 million and 122 million barrels per day (bpd) in its three scenarios called Renewal, Reform and Rivalry, compared with 97.8 million bpd in 2017.  The Renewal scenario is consistent with the goal of the Paris climate agreement to limit a rise in the world’s average surface temperatures to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times. The Reform scenario, based on a continuation of existing policy and technology trends, sees oil demand peaking at 111 million bpd around 2030, and declining to 105 million bpd in 2050. The geopolitical backdrop in Rivalry is “a fluid, volatile and conflict-ridden world”, where a lack of trust prevents countries from addressing climate change effectively. “The value proposition of democracy declines, with many parts of the world now ruled by dictators and autocrats, some of whom are intent on exporting their authoritarian political models. Other issues than climate dominate the energy policy agendas,” Equinor said of this scenario. The pace of transport electrification, energy efficiency, and “black swan” events - such as a commercial breakthrough in nuclear fusion technology, a potential source of safe and green energy - could also impact demand, Equinor added.    However, as the natural decline in existing production will likely be faster than the decline in oil demand, new investments will be need to close the gap. Even under the Renewal scenario, some 480 billion barrels of oil will be needed by 2050 from new sources, more than the total supply from OPEC countries over the last 35 years, Equinor said.

2018-06-06,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday on worries that global supply is climbing after U.S. inventories rose unexpectedly and Saudi Arabia and other big producers signalled that they may increase output. U.S. crude inventories rose 2.1 million barrels in the week to June 1, the Energy Information Administration said, a surprise after analysts had forecast a decrease of 1.8 million barrels. Fuel inventories also rose. [EIA/S] USOILC=ECI  “Oil prices are being clobbered by a surprise build to crude stocks as total imports jumped higher, blunting the impact of higher refinery runs,” said Matthew Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData in Louisville, Kentucky.  U.S. crude output hit a record of 10.8 million barrels a day in the week, according to the EIA’s weekly report. Rising production has prompted selling since global benchmark Brent LCOc1 climbed above $80 a barrel last month. “The continuing increase in crude oil production is weighing on the market, and quite significantly compared to this time last year,” Andrew Lipow, president of Houston-based Lipow Oil Associates. U.S. oil production is up 1.5 million bpd from a year earlier.  U.S. light crude CLc1 settled down 79 cents, or 1.2 percent, at $64.73 a barrel. Brent pared losses late in the session, settling down 2 cents at $75.26 a barrel. In post-settlement trade, Brent turned positive, rising 18 cents a barrel.  As U.S. crude dropped more quickly than Brent, the spread between the two widened by 6.5 percent from the previous session to as much as $10.74 a barrel.  WTCLc1-LCOc1. India’s oil minister said his Saudi counterpart told him the kingdom was revisiting its policy of cutting production, which has supported prices. The U.S. government has unofficially asked Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers to boost output, sources told Reuters on Tuesday.    OPEC and Russia will meet on June 22/23 to decide whether to increase production. The producers have been considering a supply increase of up to 1 million barrels per day, sources told Reuters. “The oil price is being driven by OPEC and views on how much and how quickly ‘OPEC plus’ will raise output,” Energy Aspects analyst Virendra Chauhan said. Balancing those expectations has been falling production in Venezuela, which has the world’s biggest oil reserves and is a key supplier to American fuel markets. Its output has been hampered by inadequate investment, mismanagement and U.S. sanctions. Three sources have told Reuters Venezuelan state firm PDVSA is considering declaring force majeure on some exports. U.S. sanctions on Iran also threaten to reduce oil exports from that OPEC producer. “It’s a tug of war between the loss of supply from Venezuela and Iran and the potential output increase from OPEC and U.S. shale,” said Tony Nunan, risk manager at Mitsubishi Corp. “$80 is a temporary ceiling for oil until we hear from OPEC.” Additional reporting by Florence Tan in Singapore and Osamu Tsukimori in Tokyo and Christopher Johnson in London; Editing by David Gregorio and Chizu Nomiyama",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/update-10-oil-falls-on-u-s-crude-build-global-supply-seen-rising-idUKL3N1T81OY,06 Jun 2018,"* U.S. crude inventories rise 2.1 mln barrels in week -EIA

2018-06-06,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria’s government has recovered around 30 billion naira ($98 million) from individuals and companies through a tax amnesty scheme, the finance ministry said on Wednesday.  The OPEC member, west Africa’s largest economy, last year emerged from a recession brought on by low oil prices. Crude sales make up two-thirds of national revenue and the government is trying to boost its income from non-oil sources. The Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS) gives tax evaders immunity from prosecution, penalty charges and interest if they voluntarily declare their previously undisclosed assets and income. The finance ministry said the Federal Inland Revenue Service chairman Babatunde Fowler announced details of money recovered while speaking at an event in the capital Abuja.  “Mr Fowler said the federal government had recovered about 30 billion naira from individuals and corporate establishments through the tax amnesty scheme,” it said in a statement. It said the database of registered taxpayers had increased from 14 million in 2016 to more than 19 million this year. Fowler “expressed optimism that the number would translate into a positive growth in the country’s tax revenue-to-GDP ratio”.  Economists have long criticized the low levels of tax collection in Africa’s most populous country. The tax-to-GDP ratio stands at 6 percent.  The government last year laid out plans to increase it to 15 percent by 2020. Earlier this month an increase in excise duties on tobacco and alcohol came into effect.

2018-06-06,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq’s parliament passed a law on Wednesday ordering a nationwide manual recount of votes in the May 12 parliamentary election, lawmakers said, a day after the prime minister said there had been serious violations. The move could hinder the delicate process of forming a new government, raising the prospect of further uncertainty in Iraq, and pits the government and parliament against the election commission, which is meant to be independent. The election was won by a bloc led by nationalist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, a long-time adversary of the United States who also opposes Iran’s sway in Iraq. Votes were counted using an electronic system that was meant to prevent fraud but is now being blamed for irregularities. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, whose bloc came in third, said on Tuesday there were “dangerous” violations and that most of the blame lay with Iraq’s Independent High Elections Commission (IHEC), high ranking members of which he banned from travel without his permission. Parliament on Wednesday voted for amendments to the election law which force the IHEC to conduct a manual recount, after it had initially declined to do so. It also suspended the commission’s leadership, which is to be replaced by nine judges. IHEC’s local chiefs in each of Iraq’s provinces are also to be replaced by judges, all picked by Iraq’s Supreme Judicial Council, a text of the amendment showed. “The Independent High Elections Commission shall commit to a manual recount in all voting centres in Iraq under the supervision of the Supreme Judicial Council and with the attendance of representatives from political groups and the United Nations,” the text of the amendment law read. The amendment also cancelled the results from overseas voting and those from displaced voters in the mainly Sunni Anbara, Salahudin, Diyala and Nineveh provinces.  It ruled out the use in future elections of electronic vote counting devices, blamed for many of the violations.  An IHEC spokesman declined to comment and said he was unauthorised to speak on this matter to the media.  Iraq’s highest judicial authority, the Supreme Judicial council, had said this week that the courts could not force the IHEC to conduct a manual recount because the law stipulated the use of electronic vote counting devices.  A spokesman for the council told Reuters on Wednesday that was no longer an issue now that parliament had amended the law. The new electronic vote counting system was introduced by IHEC on the grounds that it could reduce fraud and speed up delivery of the results. Abadi said the devices were not inspected for errors before their use and that there had been possible corruption in procuring them. Baghdad awarded Korean company Miru Systems a $135 million (£100.7 million) contract for the system, which includes around 70,000 devices to be used across the country.  Several political groups had voiced opposition to the use of the devices before the election, but not Abadi, who approved their introduction and supported their use.

2018-06-06,"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canada’s Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO) faces an indefinite delay to its biggest-ever capital project if a U.S. state regulator denies its preferred pipeline route through Minnesota, but a victory would spell relief for Canadian oil shippers and northern U.S. refiners. Some pipeline opponents, which include environmental and Native American groups, are trying to convince the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to kill the project. Others oppose only Enbridge’s proposed new pipeline route, saying it would consume more land and threaten Native Americans’ traditional harvest of wild rice from wetlands. Enbridge wants to replace the aging 1,031-mile (1,660-km) Line 3 pipeline that runs from Alberta to Wisconsin.  Worsening bottlenecks in Alberta have steepened a price discount for its heavy crude, and several pipeline projects that could ease the situation face stiff opposition. Line 3, placed into service in 1968, operates at half its capacity due to integrity concerns. Its replacement would allow it to return to approved capacity of 760,000 barrels per day. Regulatory approval may be pivotal to restoring investor confidence in Enbridge, whose stock is down 18 percent this year, partly on debt concerns, even as the S&P TSX energy index .SPTTEN is up slightly. The PUC is set to decide late this month whether the total $7 billion project is necessary and if so, what route it should take. An administrative law judge recommended in April the expanded pipeline should follow the existing route. Enbridge prefers a new route that bypasses an indigenous reservation, avoids some ecologically sensitive areas and prevents a pipeline shutdown of up to one year.  It hopes to start construction in Minnesota in November. A different route would require a detailed evaluation that would set back plans to start the added oil flow by late 2019, said Guy Jarvis, Enbridge’s executive vice-president of liquids pipelines and major projects.  “A ruling by the PUC of anything other than our preferred route is clearly going to put the timeline for this project in jeopardy,” he told Reuters in an interview. The late stages of Enbridge’s biggest-ever, three-year outreach effort will marshal Minnesota’s refiners, business and labour groups to lobby state legislators and other “influencers” for the project, Jarvis said. To those groups, Line 3 means a $2.5 billion investment in the state, more jobs and less crude travelling by rail. “It’s a full-court press,” Jarvis said. “.. They can carry the message of what it means in Minnesota better than we can.” For Flint Hills Resources, a unit of Koch Industries, Line 3 is critical to supplying its Minnesota refinery with adequate volumes of Canadian crude to produce fuel and asphalt, said spokesman Jake Reint. “We’re not getting the crude we need right now.” Enbridge’s opponents have their own gameplan. Aboriginal environment group Honor the Earth hopes to sway Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton to help kill the project. The governor has no formal role in the commission’s deliberations, but carries valuable influence, said Tara Houska, national campaigns director for Honor the Earth. The state commerce department has already said Enbridge has not shown the project is needed. A spokesperson for Dayton said the governor has made clear that the PUC operates independently of his administration. Last month, Dayton vetoed a bill that would have allowed Enbridge to bypass the PUC. Honor the Earth argues that expanding the pipeline tramples on tribal rights to harvest wild rice, hunt and fish in the area. The wild rice issue is “critical to this decision,” said Catherine Collentine of Sierra Club, another environmentalist group opposing Line 3.  The company will work to protect wild rice areas during pipeline construction and operation, Enbridge spokeswoman Suzanne Wilton said. The Canadian oil industry faces opposition to other pipeline projects, and views approval for this one as a badly needed victory. “It’s very important for the industry to prove they can, not (only) get lines built, but lines increased,” said Kevin Brent, vice-president of investments at BlueSky Equities, which owns Enbridge stock.  A loss in Minnesota “would be terrible for investor sentiment,” he said.

2018-06-06,"BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) faces production stoppages next quarter due to bottlenecks caused by new lab tests for emissions and fuel consumption, and will discuss the implications for workers in the coming days, it said on Wednesday. Europe’s largest automaker said that adapting to meet the new Worldwide Harmonized Light Duty Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP), which is based on real-driving data rather than theoretical scenarios, would require “a feat of strength.” Carmakers are rushing to get models through WLTP tests on a limited number of exhaust emission test benches as they won’t be able to sell new vehicles after Sept. 1 without the testing. At the German company’s VW brand alone, more than 200 models require new emissions and fuel economy readings, it said. Production at the main Wolfsburg plant, which employs 62,000 staff and builds the Golf, Tiguan and Touran models, will be halted on certain days in August and September, group Chief Executive Herbert Diess told a staff gathering. “We will only build vehicles in Wolfsburg after the (July 7-27) works holiday that fulfil the new standards,” Diess said. Works council chief Bernd Osterloh called on management to find ways to cope with the effects of production disruptions, saying they couldn’t be blamed on staff. “It’s not the fault of our colleagues that the company has built too few test rigs over the years and can suddenly not handle the test volume required,” Osterloh said. “We will not allow this burden to be borne by the workforce alone at the end of the day.” Volkswagen’s sports-car brand Porsche last week said it would temporarily limit the number of models it sells in Europe due to the switch to WLTP standards, without being more specific. When publishing its detailed 2017 financial results in March, the VW brand listed WLTP among the potential risks for 2018, alongside the costs for its electric-car program and regulations to curb carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

2018-06-06,"ROME (Reuters) - A plan to build the final stage of a $40 billion international gas pipeline in Italy is under review, the country’s new environment minister said, calling the project “pointless”. Italy is at the end of the Southern Gas Corridor, a pipeline taking gas from central Asia to western Europe. It is a cornerstone of the European Union’s energy security policy which aims to wean the bloc off Russian gas supplies. Environment Minister Sergio Costa, sworn in on Friday as part of a ruling coalition of anti-establishment parties, said Italy’s involvement in the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), the final stage of the 3,500-km (2,200-mile) corridor, would be reviewed along with some other major projects. “TAP is on the table and we are looking at it as a priority ...,” said Costa, who was nominated as minister by the coalition’s biggest party, the pro-environment 5-Star Movement. “Given (our) energy policy, given falling gas demand, that project today looks pointless,” he added in written responses to a series of questions put to him on Tuesday and Wednesday. A review would likely create tensions between Italy and the developers of the 4.5 billion euro ($5.3 billion) TAP project, which include British oil group BP (BP.L), Italy’s Snam (SRG.MI) and Spain’s Enagás (ENAG.MC).  It is unclear whether the minister’s comments will translate into action. Costa said any decision on TAP’s future would also involve other ministers. The 5-Star also has more radical environmental policies than its coalition partner, the right-wing League. The parties have said they will form a special committee to resolve any differences between them on the “realisation and completion of public works of national significance”. The League did not immediately respond to emailed requests for a comment. Demand for gas in Italy has risen in recent years but is still well below its peaks of a decade ago. Costa made clear the review would focus on the underlying rationale for the TAP project arriving in Italy. That is in contrast to recent public debate which has focussed instead on its planned route through the country’s southern Puglia region. Even Puglia’s governor has said it should be redirected away from a tourist area rather than scrapped. He has proposed an alternative route via a more industrial area of Puglia. The new government’s minister for southern Italy, Barbara Lezzi, another member of 5-Star, also told Reuters on Wednesday that her party believed the pipeline represented an unnecessary environmental danger given Italy’s excess gas capacity. The TAP consortium has said re-routing the pipeline away from Italy is not an option and that redirecting it inside Italy could delay the project by four to five years. [nL8N1OM1OF] The Southern Gas Corridor, already mostly completed, snakes its way from Azerbaijan through eastern Europe towards Italy. It would bring up to 10 billion cubic metres of gas to Italy from Shah Deniz 2, a gas field developed by a BP-led consortium. The Italian end is due to be completed by early 2020 and has already received national government approvals, including environmental clearance in 2014. Costa said the review was consistent with the coalition’s energy policy, which was outlined in a published coalition accord signed by 5-Star and League ahead of taking power. A published copy of the accord does not specifically mention the TAP project but it says the coalition would accelerate Italy’s transition to renewable energy. The 5-Star has said it wants to phase out fossil fuels by 2050 by ramping up renewable energy production.

2018-06-06,"PARIS/WASHINGTON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. officials are touring the globe to pressure countries to shun trade with Iran following Washington’s withdrawal from a nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers, a move that undermines European efforts to save the accord, sources said. U.S. State and Treasury Department officials have travelled to Japan and this week U.S. diplomats are in eastern Europe as Britain, France and Germany scramble to save the 2015 pact and convince Iran that they can continue to do business with Tehran. “The Americans are on a roadshow and going everywhere. They are dogmatic,” said a senior European diplomat. “We were clear and told them: if you are coming to tell to us how to apply American laws here then you’re not welcome,” the diplomat said. Ministers from the three European nations and the EU foreign policy chief have written to U.S. counterparts urging them to protect EU companies working in Iran from getting caught up in Washington’s new sanctions on the Islamic Republic. In the June 4 letter, the foreign and finance ministers singled out areas where they expected exemptions for EU firms, including pharmaceuticals, healthcare, energy, automotive, civil aviation, infrastructure and banking. The letter appeared to accept that despite their efforts to circumvent secondary sanctions, the U.S. action could prevent the EU from continuing “meaningful sanctions relief to Iran.” The U.S. roadshow suggests there is little appetite in Washington to compromise. “We will hold those doing prohibited business in Iran to account,” U.S. Under Secretary of the Treasury Sigal Mandelker said in a blunt speech on Tuesday. A second EU official said the U.S. was sending out such teams across the world with a private warning against doing business with Iran. Washington last month said it would impose new economic penalties after pulling out of the accord that world powers struck with Iran under which Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. One EU official said the United States had also pressed the European Investment Bank, which has never done business in Iran, not to invest in European firms doing business there, despite a European Commission proposal it start doing so. The European powers are trying to come up with a package to ring-fence trade with Iran against renewed U.S. financial sanctions to dissuade Tehran from quitting the accord. But the global reach of the U.S. financial system, forcing companies to choose between two irreconcilable options - selling to Iran or to the vast U.S. market - is driving home the limits of European efforts to shield their revived trade with Tehran. According to two diplomats, Andrew Peek, deputy assistant secretary of state with responsibility for Iran and Iraq, was in the Czech Republic on Tuesday and Hungary on Wednesday. “The State Department delegation to Europe seeks to garner support for our global effort to pressure Iran and to explain our sanctions policy,” an U.S. State Department official said. “We are making stops to many countries and will expand our diplomatic outreach efforts worldwide in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, our engagement with the E3 (Britain, France, Germany) is on-going, including during this worldwide diplomatic engagement.” Peek briefed senior EU diplomats in Washington in May and warned the bloc to cut investments in Iran, telling EU officials doing business with Tehran helped fund its missile programme and support for proxies in Yemen and Syria, diplomats said. One diplomat said the focus on Eastern European nations might be designed to pressure those EU countries most dependent on U.S. security assistance in the face of a resurgent Russia. However, another diplomat suggested the push could backfire.   “This escalation and strategy of confrontation is a serious mistake and risks provoking even more chaos and instability in the Middle East,” said a diplomat aware of the roadshow, saying U.S. efforts had begun to “irritate quite a few of its allies.” Additional reporting by Marton Dunai in Budapest, Writing by John Irish, Editing by William Maclean",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-usa/us-officials-on-roadshow-to-cut-iran-investment-trade-sources-idUKL2N1T80X6,06 Jun 2018,"U.S. officials

2018-06-06,"(Reuters) - Oil and gas producer Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) said on Wednesday it would sell its stakes in pipeline operator EnLink Midstream for $3.13 billion to pare debt and focus on its core shale business as crude prices hover near four-year highs. The company’s shares rose more than 6 percent to $41.85 in early afternoon trade as the company also boosted its share buyback program to $4 billion from $1 billion. Devon leads a pack of oil producers that are looking to drill beyond the Permian basin in Texas and eyeing little known Oklahoma-based shale producing areas of SCOOP and STACK to boost production. Devon said in March it was looking at asset sales of up to $5 billion, as the industry comes under pressure from Wall Street to look for more ways to boost shareholder returns. “The EnLink proceeds, combined with proceeds from the non-core E&P assets already sold and those currently being marketed, will exceed our $5 billion divestiture target,” Chief Executive Officer Dave Hager said in statement. Like other oil and gas producers, Devon is trying to simplify its asset portfolio, cut costs and at the same time return cash to shareholders. “The midstream monetization may have come sooner than anticipated as some were expecting sale of Canada or the Eagle Ford,” said Cowen & Co analyst Kathy Yang. “We would not rule out further portfolio optimization as focus is on Delaware & STACK core assets.” Tudor Pickering & Co analyst Jamaal Dardar said investors are expecting Devon to sell another $3 billion in assets, including in the Eagle Ford basin in Texas. Devon plans to sell its stakes in EnLink Midstream Partners LP ENLK.N and EnLink Midstream LLC (ENLC.N) to an affiliate of Global Infrastructure Partners. The new buyback is conditional on closing the EnLink deal, which the company expects by July, it said in a statement. Devon said the sale will reduce debt by 40 percent. The company’s total long-term debt at the end of 2017 was $10.29 billion, according to the company’s latest annual filing. In April, the company cut around 300 jobs, roughly 9 percent of its staff to reduce costs and save $150 million to $200 million by 2020.

Robust growth is making the central bank increasingly confident that inflation is on its way back to target, ECB chief economist Peter Praet said on Wednesday, raising the likelihood it may use a meeting next week to reveal more about the end of its bond-buying programme. The comments boosted the euro. The euro was up 0.47 percent to $1.1772. The dollar index fell 0.32 percent. Jitters that the ECB would buy fewer bonds triggered a broad sell-off in German Bunds and other European government debt, which spilled over to the Treasuries sector, analysts said. The yield on Germany’s benchmark 10-year bond up nearly eight basis points to 0.44 percent, on track for their biggest daily rise in nearly a year. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 15/32 in price to yield 2.9717 percent, from 2.919 percent late on Tuesday. “Bunds were leading the sell-off,” said John Canavan, market strategist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in New York. Praet’s comments “pulled forward the ECB move in some people’s mind.” Wall Street stocks climbed, with Tesla Inc gaining after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk reassured shareholders that building 5,000 of its mass-market Model 3 cars per week by the end of June was “quite likely.” The Nasdaq hit another record intraday high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 226.61 points, or 0.91 percent, to 25,026.59, the S&P 500 gained 11.66 points, or 0.42 percent, to 2,760.46 and the Nasdaq Composite added 17.77 points, or 0.23 percent, to 7,655.64. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.07 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.53 percent. Investors said the new Italian government’s big-spending fiscal plans, a major worry for markets over the last few weeks, were unlikely to be helped by the ECB tightening its own policy. Oil prices fell on signs Saudi Arabia and other big producers may increase production. U.S. crude fell more than 1 percent on a surprise build in domestic crude stockpiles. U.S. crude fell 1.25 percent to $64.70 per barrel and Brent was last at $74.97, down 0.54 percent.

2018-06-06,"OSLO, June 6 (Reuters) - Finland’s two operating Olkiluoto nuclear reactors appear to fulfil all basic preconditions to get a 20-year lifetime extension, the director of the country’s energy department told Reuters on Wednesday. The reactors’ licences expire by year-end but Riku Huttunen’s comments suggest they are set to stay in operation. The Olkiluoto 1 reactor, which started operations in 1978, and Olkiluoto 2, commissioned two years later, have a combined net output capacity of 1,770 megawatts, and account for around one-sixth of Finland’s electricity needs. “All basic preconditions seem to be fulfilled. The decision will be taken in early autumn, most likely,” said Huttunen, who heads the energy department within Finland’s economy ministry. A final decision on the licence renewal will be made by the government, he added. Last week, Finland’s radiation and nuclear safety authority (STUK) said it supported an application by the reactors’ owner, Teollisuuden Voima (TVO), to extend their operating licences until 2038. STUK said Olkiluoto 1 and 2 met the safety and legal requirements that have been set for their lifetimes to be extended and approved the nuclear waste management procedures set out by TVO. It said however that TVO must test the ageing reactors’ pressure vessels once every eight years, with the first pressure tests scheduled for 2019 and 2020. TVO is anticipating the addition of a third, long-delayed, unit in its Olkiluoto site by 2019. Olkiluoto 3 will be one of the world’s largest reactors with a capacity of 1.6 gigawatts. Renewing the licences for the two older reactors and adding another could help Finland reach its goal of reducing carbon emissions and getting rid of coal from power production by 2030. The Nordic country, which depends largely on Swedish and Russian power imports, saw industrial energy needs grow by 1.7 percent last year, while net power imports hit a record high.

2018-06-06,"THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The International Court of Justice said on Wednesday it can rule in a dispute over whether a luxury building in Paris owned by the son of Equatorial Guinea’s president is part of the African nation’s diplomatic mission. Equatorial Guinea had argued at the ICJ, also known as the World Court, that a 2012 raid on Theodorin Obiang’s residence was improper because he enjoyed diplomatic immunity and the residence was diplomatic property. The French government said Equatorial Guinea was attempting to shield Obiang, known for posting pictures of his glamorous lifestyle on Instagram, by adding him to its diplomatic mission retroactively. Police raided Obiang’s residence as part of a corruption investigation, eventually seizing 100 million euros (£87.8 million) worth of assets, including paintings by Renoir and Degas. Obiang was convicted in absentia on embezzlement charges last year. Judges at the U.N.’s highest court said they lacked jurisdiction in any discussion of Obiang’s diplomatic status, but they were empowered under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations to determine the status of the building. That includes “any claims relating to the furnishings and other property present on the premises at 42 Avenue Foch in Paris,” presiding judge Adulqawi Ahmed Yusuf said. Avenue Foch is a grand, sweeping road near the Arc de Triomphe favoured by wealthy African expatriates and politicians. The Obiang property, bought for 25 million euros in 2005, had 101 rooms, a gym, hair-dressing studio, disco, and a cinema. Obiang is the son of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who has ruled Equatorial Guinea, a former Spanish colony, for more than three decades.  Rights groups have labelled his administration as one of the world’s most corrupt. The case at the ICJ will now move forward and the court will set a date for hearings on the merits of the case, a process likely to take more than a year.

2018-06-06,"RIO DE JANEIRO/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) and Halliburton Co (HAL.N) are preparing offers for an onshore production sharing deal with Brazil’s state-controlled Petrobras (PETR4.SA), two sources said, a first for oil services firms in the Latin American country. Another source said General Electric Co’s (GE.N) unit Baker Hughes (BHGE.N) is also studying a potential bid for the tender, launched by Petrobras in May. A deal would represent a novel way for the debt-laden oil company to boost output from mature fields without losing control or risking capital, by partnering with one of the world’s largest oil service providers. Such a deal would also allow oil services companies to put to use expensive equipment idled for years during the downturn in Brazil’s oil industry, hammered by low oil prices and a massive corruption scandal at Petrobras. South America’s largest producer has attracted billions of dollars of investment from the world’s top oil firms to develop prolific deep water oilfields.      The tender, or invitation to bid, was addressed to the world’s three top oil services companies, the three people said.    The firms would compete by promising to boost production from the Potiguar basin’s waning Canto do Amaro field, where production began in 1986, and offering a bigger share of output to Petrobras, they added. Under the 15-year contract, the winner would provide capital to drill new wells in the area located in the coastal state of Rio Grande do Norte in northern Brazil, two people said. Bids are due this month, but at least one of the companies has asked for an extension, a person said. Talks to reach such a deal were more than a year in the making, 10 people said.  Spokespeople for Baker Hughes, Schlumberger, Halliburton and Petrobras declined to comment. Production sharing deals are usually made by oil producers rather than oil service firms. Oilfield service companies engaging in production-sharing activities can be seen as competing with customers, and also expose themselves to more risk from swings in oil prices. The May tender was not Petrobras’s only bid to boost output from mature fields. Last year, Norway’s Equinor (EQNR.OL), formerly Statoil, paid up to $2.9 billion for a 25 percent stake in Petrobras’s Roncador, one of Brazil’s largest oilfields in the Campos basin. [nL8N1OI13X] But Potiguar basin limited output would be unlikely to draw interest from such oil majors.  Schlumberger, the world’s largest oilfield service firm, has used similar deal structures elsewhere through its production management group, in some cases financing projects in exchange for full service rights and a share of profits. This has taken the firm away from its traditional oil service business model. [nL2N1LO2F9]    The firm’s production management unit has had varying degrees of success buying stakes in oil fields and in production sharing models. On at least one deal in the U.S. shale patch, it had to write off millions of dollars in losses, and it has also faced payment issues for a project in Ecuador. Schlumberger executives have said this year that the firm was slowing project approval for the group.  Clinching such a deal would, however, represent a bigger milestone for Halliburton and GE’s Baker Hughes, which have not typically taken stakes in customer projects.  Still, Baker Hughes last year announced a deal with Twinza Oil Limited to provide a range of services for the development of an offshore gas field in Papua New Guinea, and provide a credit line to fund appraisal of the field.  And Halliburton signed a fee-per-barrel deal in Mexico’s Chicontepec basin five years ago.

Crude inventories rose by 2.1 million barrels in the week to June 1, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 1.8 million barrels. The bulk of that build was due to a sharp increase in stocks on the West Coast, where inventories jumped 2.5 million barrels the EIA said. Oil prices fell on the data. U.S. crude futures dropped $1.19 to $64.34 a barrel, while Brent crude fell 81 cents to $74.56 a barrel as of 10:51 a.m. EDT (1451 GMT). The spread between U.S. crude and Brent WTCLc1-LCOc widened by about 4 percent to more than $10 a barrel. Refining crude runs and rates hit their highest levels since late December as facilities came back online after periods of maintenance. Refinery crude runs rose 214,000 barrels per day to 17.4 million bpd and utilization rates rose by 1.5 percentage points to 95.4 percent of available capacity, EIA data showed. Gasoline stocks rose by 4.6 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations for a 587,000-barrel gain. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 2.2 million barrels, versus expectations for a 784,000-barrel increase, the EIA data showed.

France made proposals in February that could meet long-standing demands by the European Commission for Paris to privatise its hydropower concessions, which are mostly operated by state-controlled utility EDF. “We are interested in eight of the originally published concessions to be auctioned ... We are targeting 1,000 megawatts of hydropower concessions in France,” said Statkraft spokesman Lars Magnus Gunther. However, he added ongoing talks between the French government and European Commission could change which concessions Statkraft would bid for, when and in what order. “France is a very interesting energy market and shows high potential for Statkraft’s core competence. Statkraft has actively prepared for market opening over the last few years and is ready for the competition,” he said. France has 25,519 megawatts of installed hydropower capacity, second after nuclear energy. Hydropower covered 10 percent of French electricity demand in 2017. The prospect of privatising hydropower assets sparked opposition from French union CGT, which said it could jeopardise the country’s energy security and threatened action against the plan. About 80 percent of state-owned hydropower concessions are managed by EDF and another 15 percent by French energy group Engie.

2018-06-06,"* Seriti Resources eyes assets with export capabilities * Interested in Optimum’s coal assets * Would pit it against Exxaro * CEO wants to list Seriti eventually By Tanisha Heiberg JOHANNESBURG, June 6 (Reuters) - South African miner Seriti Resources wants to move into exporting coal and would be interested in buying the assets and quotas of the Gupta family’s Optimum Coal, its CEO said. Bidding for Optimum Coal would pit Seriti, which has ambitions to become a black-owned mining champion, with bigger miner Exxaro, which has expressed interest in buying Optimum’s coal export quotas. Optimum Coal sought protection from creditors on Feb. 20 with seven other companies owned by the Guptas, who are accused of corrupt ties to former South African President Jacob Zuma. Zuma and the Gupta brothers deny any wrongdoing. Optimum has not made clear if its assets are up for sale but Seriti’s CEO and shareholder Mike Teke used to own a stake in the company until Glencore bid for it in 2011. “Yes I am interested,” Teke told Reuters on the sidelines of a mining conference in Johannesburg. “I still believe I can run the mine, I still believe I can add value, I still believe I can change the bad things that have happened at that mine.” Seriti already owns three coal mines acquired a year ago from Anglo American in a $166 million deal that marked the first step in creating what Teke, a former teacher turned mining boss, aims to become a publicly traded South African black-owned mining company. Seriti is co-owned by four black anchor shareholders - Teke’s investment company Masimong Group, as well as Thebe Investments, Zungu Investments (Zico) and Community Investment Holdings (CIH). Seriti currently produces thermal coal for power stations operated by South African utility Eskom, which collectively generate about 23 percent of the country’s electricity, but Teke said it wants to move into exporting coal. “My vision is I want Seriti to move into that tier where it’s a mining house that people will think of,” said Teke, a former chairman of lobby group Chamber of Mines. Running Optimum again would be a major step forward. “Just like when you grow up there are things that you desire in a toy store, there are assets I desire to own,” he said, referring to Optimum Coal. Bloomberg reports have suggested that Glencore is also weighing buying back Optimum, which it sold to Oakbay Investments, owned by the Gupta family, for 2.1 billion rand ($145 million) in 2016. Glencore declined to comment on the matter on Wednesday.

2018-06-06,"NEW DELHI, June 6 (Reuters) - India’s oil minister said on Wednesday Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers are “revisiting” their output-cutting policy, referring to a discussion he had with his Saudi counterpart. “For the first time, the Saudi oil minister called us and said ‘we are revisiting our policy on oil output cuts’,” Indian Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said. This follows news on Tuesday that the U.S. government had unofficially asked Saudi Arabia and some other OPEC producers to raise oil output. OPEC and non-member producers led by Russia had agreed to curb output by about 1.8 million barrels per day until the end of 2018 to reduce global stocks, but the inventory overhang is now near OPEC’s target. Ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other participants in the output agreement meet in Vienna on June 22-23 to decide policy. Oil prices hit a 3-1/2-year high of $80 per barrel in mid-May on concerns about a possible supply shortage fuelled by new U.S. sanctions against OPEC member Iran. Around the same time, when India had expressed frustration over rising oil prices, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told Pradhan that supporting global economic growth was one of the Gulf nation’s key goals. India imports almost 80 percent of the crude it consumes. Pradhan, talking to reporters in New Delhi on Wednesday, said India was awaiting clarity on the impact of U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude exports.

2018-06-06,"LONDON (Reuters) - European refiners are winding down oil purchases from Iran, closing the door on a fifth of the OPEC member’s crude exports after the United States imposed sanctions on Tehran, company and trading sources said. The drop in crude purchases from the Islamic republic could complicate efforts by European governments to salvage the Iranian nuclear deal disavowed by U.S. President Donald Trump last month. Although European governments have not followed Washington by creating new sanctions, banks, insurers and shippers are gradually severing ties with Iran under pressure from the U.S. restrictions, making trade with Tehran complicated and risky. Trump on May 4 announced his decision to quit the landmark 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. The restrictions on Iran’s oil sector take effect after a 180-day “wind-down period” ending on Nov. 4. Ministers from Germany, France and Britain have urged U.S. officials to shield European companies from the sanctions, but refiners are not taking any chances. “We cannot defy the United States,” said a senior source at Italy’s Saras (SRS.MI), which operates the 300,000-barrels-per-day (bpd) Sarroch refinery in Sardinia. Saras is determining how best to halt its purchasing of Iranian oil within the permitted 180 days, the source said, adding: “It is not clear yet what the U.S. administration can do but in practice we can get into trouble.” Refiners including France’s Total (TOTF.PA), Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI) and Saras, Spain’s Repsol (REP.MC) and Cepsa as well as Greece’s Hellenic Petroleum (HEPr.AT) are preparing to halt purchases of Iranian oil once sanctions bite, the sources said. These refiners account for most of Europe’s purchases of Iranian crude, which represent around a fifth of the country’s oil exports.  Iran’s crude sales to foreign buyers averaged around 2.5 million bpd in recent months, according to data collected by Reuters and EU statistics office Eurostat. The bulk of the exports go to Asia. (Graphic: Iranian crude exports - reut.rs/2Jw4ehD) The companies, most of which have long-term contracts with Iran’s national oil company, will continue to purchase cargoes until the sanctions take effect, the sources said. Total, Europe’s largest refiner, does not intend to request a waiver to continue crude oil trading with Iran after Nov. 4, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. That effectively means it will be unable to keep purchasing crude. Eni said it had an oil supply contract outstanding for the purchase of 2 million barrels per month, expiring at the end of the year. Repsol and Hellenic Petroleum declined to comment. “Our trading activity (remains) business as usual ... We continue to strictly conform with European Union and international laws and regulations,” a Cepsa spokesman said. Iranian crude can be substituted by Russian Ural grades, whose prices have risen following the U.S. announcement, as well as crude from Saudi Arabia, trading sources said. (Graphic: Iran's crude oil trade - reut.rs/2Lq7Jnh) Some of the refiners, including Cepsa, are considering whether to request a waiver from U.S. authorities to continue buying beyond the November deadline in order to complete their term agreements. “With a longer-term contract in place, we’re hoping to get a six-month waiver,” an industry source close to Cepsa said. “From November, we don’t know if any cuts will have to be partial or total.”  Crude trade between Iran and Europe has risen sharply since the lifting of tough sanctions on Tehran in 2015. But banks, shipping firms and insurance companies are now distancing themselves from the Islamic republic, leaving Europe’s refiners few options but to stop oil purchases. “It’s a matter of finding a tanker and an insurer that will cover it. It’s definitely not easy right now,” a source at Repsol said. Hellenic had to stop imports because the Swiss bank that it used was no longer processing payments to Iran, an industry source familiar with the situation said. Asian buyers are also expected to reduce their purchases. India’s Reliance Industries Ltd (RELI.NS), owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, plans to halt oil imports from Iran, two sources familiar with the matter said last week.

2018-06-06,"ROME, June 6 (Reuters) - A plan to build the final stage of a $40 billion international gas pipeline in Italy is under review, the country’s new environment minister said, calling the project “pointless”. Italy is at the end of the Southern Gas Corridor, a pipeline taking gas from central Asia to western Europe. It is a cornerstone of the European Union’s energy security policy which aims to wean the bloc off Russian gas supplies. Environment Minister Sergio Costa, sworn in on Friday as part of a ruling coalition of anti-establishment parties, said Italy’s involvement in the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), the final stage of the 3,500-km (2,200-mile) corridor, would be reviewed along with some other major projects. “TAP is on the table and we are looking at it as a priority ...,” said Costa, who was nominated as minister by the coalition’s biggest party, the pro-environment 5-Star Movement. “Given (our) energy policy, given falling gas demand, that project today looks pointless,” he added in written responses to a series of questions put to him on Tuesday and Wednesday. A review would likely create tensions between Italy and the developers of the 4.5 billion euro ($5.3 billion) TAP project, which include British oil group BP, Italy’s Snam and Spain’s Enagás. It is unclear whether the minister’s comments will translate into action. Costa said any decision on TAP’s future would also involve other ministers. The 5-Star also has more radical environmental policies than its coalition partner, the right-wing League.

2018-06-06,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain’s Repsol (REP.MC) plans to increase investment and production and lift its dividend by 2020 after years of cost cuts, the oil and gas company said on Wednesday, as a rebound in global oil prices boosted its profits. The refiner will spend 15 billion euros (13 billion pounds) across units including exploration, production, refining and commercial over the next two years, it said in its 2018-2020 strategy plan. Repsol had focused on cost and debt reduction since paying a hefty premium to buy Canadian producer Talisman for $8.3 billion in 2015, just as a plummeting oil price forced companies across the sector to tighten their belts.  It now forecasts production will rise to 750,000 barrels per day in 2020, from 727,000 a day in the first quarter of this year. The targets are based on an oil price of $50 a barrel, “the harshest scenario”, Chief Executive Josu Jon Imaz said during a presentation of the plan.  Brent crude is currently trading at around $76 a barrel. LCOc1  “Taking into account the cost of replacing reserves, $50 or $60 could be a floor for the price of crude in the next few years,” Imaz said. If the price of a barrel stays above $50, Repsol plans to speed up existing projects and buy back additional shares.  Shareholders can expect to receive a dividend of 1 euro per share in 2020, up from 0.90 euros in 2018. The increased payout and investments will be partially funded by Repsol’s sale of a 20 percent stake in utility Gas Natural GAS.MC to CVC Capital Partners for 3.8 billion euros earlier this year. Shares jumped 3 percent to almost 17 euros on Wednesday, leading gainers on Spain’s blue-chip Ibex index.  Repsol is also looking to diversify towards renewable energy and gas in response to pressure faced by refiners to move to low-carbon sources. Imaz expressed support for the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change, adding, “We want to be part of the solution.” Under the new plan, Repsol will pour 2.5 billion euros into low-emissions businesses, as well as a further 1.5 billion euros into growing its downstream refining business. Net debt, for a long time one of the company’s biggest headaches, is projected to stand at 0.7 times core earnings in 2020, from a ratio of 0.9 in 2017.

2018-06-06,"VIENNA/PARIS, June 6 (Reuters) - Iran will not cooperate more fully with atomic inspectors until a standoff over its nuclear deal is resolved, its U.N. envoy said, as one signatory warned Tehran against moving ahead with preparations to boost its uranium enrichment capacity. European powers have been scrambling to salvage the agreement they signed in 2015 since U.S. President Donald Trump pulled Washington out last month and said he would reimpose far-reaching U.S. sanctions on Iran. Foreign and finance ministers from those three countries - France, Britain and Germany - have written to U.S. officials to stress their commitment to upholding the pact, and to urge Washington to spare EU firms active in Iran from secondary sanctions. An Iranian withdrawal from the deal, which lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, would “further unsettle a region where additional conflicts would be disastrous,” the ministers wrote in the letter dated June 4 and seen by Reuters on Wednesday. Since the U.S. pullout was announced, authorities in Tehran have sent mixed signals on whether they believe the nuclear deal’s remaining signatories, which also include China and Russia, can salvage it. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said on Monday he had ordered preparations to increase uranium enrichment capacity if the agreement collapsed. Tehran also informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.N. nuclear watchdog that polices restrictions placed on its activities under the deal, of “tentative” plans to produce the feedstock for centrifuges, the machines that enrich uranium. In Paris on Wednesday, French Foreign Minister Yves Le Drian told Europe 1 radio that, while that initiative remained within the framework of the nuclear deal, it was unwelcome and risked sailing close to a “red line”. Emphasising that Tehran’s patience with European efforts to save the deal was not unlimited, its envoy to the IAEA said it had granted the three powers a few weeks. “A few weeks means a few weeks, not a few months,” Reza Najafi said outside a quarterly meeting of the agency’s Board of Governors in Vienna. He also dismissed calls by the IAEA to go the extra mile in cooperating with the nuclear watchdog’s inspectors, telling reporters that, while the standoff over the deal continued, “no one should expect Iran to go to implement more voluntary measures.” “But I should emphasize that it does not mean that right now Iran will restart any activities contrary to the (deal),” Najafi added. “These are only preparatory works.” The agency has said Tehran is implementing its commitments, but also called for “timely and proactive cooperation” on providing access for snap inspections. Diplomats who deal with the agency say an inspection in late April went down to the wire in terms of how quickly the IAEA team gained access to one site.

2018-06-06,"WOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) said it has reinstated its former chief lobbyist after an internal investigation into his role in tests that exposed monkeys and humans to toxic diesel fumes found no evidence of wrongdoing. In January Europe’s largest automaker had suspended Thomas Steg, a former German government spokesman who took charge of external relations at Volkswagen in 2012, pending the investigation.  “Volkswagen management, as well as I personally, believe that it is part of good corporate culture that employees must be fully rehabilitated after being exonerated,” VW’s head of integrity and legal affairs, Hiltrud Werner, told reporters on Wednesday at the carmaker’s base in Wolfsburg. The company is continuing a broader investigation into all of its research projects.   A source at VW had said in January that 58-year-old Steg, as head of sustainability topics at the VW group, was not only in charge of the unit that had commissioned the tests but also had prior knowledge of the monkey experiments and had made no effort to stop them. “I was neither responsible for the planning, the authorization or the commissioning of this study,” Steg told a press briefing on Wednesday. “The study was unnecessary and of no scientific use, it should have never happened.” The project was funded by VW and German peers Daimler and BMW who sought to prove that diesel cars posed less of a threat to human health than groups including the World Health Organization have claimed, an auto-industry source has said. After Steg was relieved of his duties, Daimler and BMW also suspended or moved employees linked to the group that had commissioned the tests, the European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector (EUGT), which was funded by the three carmakers. “You can rest assured: We will continue our investigation of all experimental and research projects in which the company was or is involved, directly or indirectly, and will complete it in the second half of the year,” Werner said. The New York Times first reported the experiments, which it said were conducted in 2014, a year before VW was found cheating U.S. diesel emissions tests, which sparked the biggest business crisis in its history.  VW has since pledged sweeping steps to ensure that a scandal such as “Dieselgate” will never happen again. A lot of the changes will be overseen by Werner, a former head of group auditing at VW. Wednesday’s announcement to bring back Steg comes as VW, under new Chief Executive Herbert Diess, seeks to accelerate its post-Dieselgate transformation and shift focus back to its operating business, especially its push to embrace electric cars and new mobility services.

2018-06-06,"* Ex-PMs Abbasi, Sharif to face inquiry, says anti-graft agency * Pakistan is one of the world’s fastest-growing LNG markets * National exchequer suffered loss of billions of rupees -agency (Adds details, background) By Asif Shahzad ISLAMABAD, June 6 (Reuters) - Pakistan’s anti-corruption agency has approved an inquiry into former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and his predecessor Nawaz Sharif over a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal project, the agency said on Wednesday. The news comes less than a week after the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), founded by Sharif, finished its five-year term, handing power to a technocratic caretaker government until elections on July 25. The National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) decision, involving an unidentified terminal is one of the world’s fastest growing LNG markets, is part of a sweeping new initiative targeting senior politicians across the South Asian nation. The national exchequer had suffered a loss of billions of rupees, the NAB said in ordering the inquiry against Abbasi, Sharif and others for granting a 15-year LNG terminal contract “to a company of their liking, in violation of rules and by misuse of their powers”. It did not say which of Pakistan’s two completed terminal projects was referred to. Several more are in the pipeline. Abbasi, who ended PML-N’s term as premier, told Reuters he was unaware of any NAB inquiry, and nobody had contacted him. As petroleum minister when Sharif was premier, Abbasi masterminded Pakistan’s push to embrace LNG after PML-N swept to power in a 2013 election. In a response to Reuters, Abbasi said he took full responsibility for work at the petroleum ministry as Sharif had “no direct responsibility for the workings of my ministry”. He added, “I welcome any inquiry by NAB or any other agency into the affairs of the ministry and I am available to cooperate with any such inquiry.” Text messages and telephone calls to the spokesman of Sharif, who has accused the judiciary of a witch hunt against his party, received no response. The corruption agency also approved an inquiry against Sharif’s brother Shehbaz, formerly the chief minister of the vast eastern province of Punjab, who is seen as the favourite to fight the next election as PML-N’s prime ministerial candidate.

Robust growth is making the central bank increasingly confident that inflation is on its way back to target, ECB chief economist Peter Praet said on Wednesday, raising the likelihood it may use a meeting next week to reveal more about the end of its bond-buying programme. Praet’s comments supported the euro, which rose 0.5 percent to 1.1769, weakening the dollar and looking likely in part to help U.S. stocks, which were set to open higher. S&P 500 futures were up 0.2 percent as trade tensions with China also eased, while the technology-focused NASDAQ was set to hit a record for the second day in a row. In Europe bonds sold off, with the yield on Germany’s benchmark 10-year bond up nearly eight basis points to 0.44 percent, on track for their biggest daily rise in nearly a year. The continent’s benchmark Stoxx 600 index was flat, with interest rate-sensitive consumer staples and utilities stocks among the heaviest fallers. Italian stocks underperformed, falling as much as 1.4 percent before recovering some losses to trade down 0.3 percent. Investors said the new government’s big-spending fiscal plans, a major worry for markets over the last few weeks, were unlikely to be helped by the ECB tightening its own policy. Italian borrowing costs also rose more than most in Europe, with the 10-year yield rising 20 basis points to 2.96 percent. “Profligate ECB bond buying in the face of profligate Italian fiscal policy is an interesting conflict,” said Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management. “We believe the bond buying programme will conclude by the end of this year.” MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.27 percent, mainly as a result of a strong showing from Asian stocks. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.68 percent. The euro’s rise put pressure on the U.S. dollar index , that measures performance against six major currencies, with the main weighting given to the euro. The index fell 0.3 percent. The Mexican peso steadied on Wednesday, after falling to its weakest since February 2017 late on Tuesday after the United States raised the possibility of turning negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement into bilateral talks. Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow also revived the possibility that the president will seek to replace NAFTA with bilateral deals with Canada and Mexico. The threat of rising trade protectionism has already taken a toll on global trade and could increase risks to growth, ANZ analysts Daniel Been and Giulia Lavinia Specchia said in a note. “Against this backdrop, we believe financial markets will become even more sensitive to bad news,” they wrote, while recommending a defensive stance on risk-taking. Most other emerging currencies strengthened against the dollar, already lower versus the strong euro. MSCI’s emerging market currency index ticked higher, rising 0.1 percent. Oil prices steadied on Wednesday after Venezuela raised the prospect of a halt to some crude exports, easing worries about oversupply after reports that the U.S. government had asked Saudi Arabia and some other producers to increase output. Brent crude was broadly flat at $75.31 per barrel.

2018-06-06,"* Kazakhstan set to complete upgrade of its oil refineries * To become net exporter of oil products in the region * Astana moving further away from Moscow’s political clout By Alla Afanasyeva MOSCOW, June 6 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan is set to rival Russian firms in the lucrative Central Asian fuel market once it finishes upgrading its oil refineries, officials in Astana and industry sources said. The government is considering halting light oil product imports from Russia and lifting a ban on such exports that was originally imposed to ensure reliable supplies on the domestic market, they said. Astana has been looking at selling into other former Soviet republics and beyond - a market dominated by Russia - for some time. “Central Asia and Afghanistan are the key markets for Kazakhstan,” Energy Minister Kanat Bozumbayev said last year. But now Kazakhstan - the region’s second biggest crude oil producer after Russia - is achieving a surplus over its own gasoline and diesel needs, meaning it can start acting on the idea. Kazakhstan is rapidly expanding production at its three large refineries. It has completed upgrading the Pavlodar plant, with work at Atyrau and Shymkent expected to be finished soon, the energy ministry said in response to Reuters questions. The plants’ combined annual oil products output will increase by eight percent to 15.3 million tonnes this year, while gasoline and diesel production will exceed Kazakhstan’s domestic demand by 1.5 - 2.0 million tonnes per year, the energy ministry said. Despite producing 1.74 million barrels of crude per day, Kazakhstan has long imported oil products from its former Soviet-era master Russia due to the past lack of refining capacity. These amount to around 1.7 million tonnes a year. Its ambitions mark another step away from Moscow for Kazakhstan, where around 85 percent of the population are fluent Russian speakers, but which is planning to a switch to a Latin-based alphabet from Cyrillic. Kazakhstan has already faced overproduction of gasoline this year, which has led to lower prices. Aiming to remove the surplus, the government plans to ban imports of the popular A-92 grade of gasoline and secure a deal to supply neighbouring Kyrgyzstan, the energy ministry told Reuters in an email. “The government wants to start active discussions of these issues in parliament in June,” a source close to the government said. According to the energy ministry estimates, imports of Russian A-92 gasoline reached 386,000 tonnes in January-April, surpassing the plan of 280,000 tonnes. For the whole of 2018, Russia is set to supply 800,000 tonnes of gasoline, 520,000 tonnes of diesel and 300,000 tonnes of jet fuel to Kazakhstan as Moscow raises exports due to its own extensive refineries modernisation. Kazakhstan, in its turn, may export 200,000-300,000 tonnes of gasoline this year, increasing to 500,000 tonnes in 2019, according to industry sources and Reuters calculations. Combined annual imports of light oil products by Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan stand at around 3.7 million tonnes. Kazakhstan’s energy ministry declined to comment on the figures. Russia’s Rosneft, Gazprom Neft and privately-owned Forteinvest are the main players on the Central Asian fuel market. Spokespeople for all three companies declined to comment. However, a source at Gazprom Neft, which has a network of gasoline stations in the region, said that the company may consider buying gasoline and diesel from Kazakhstan if it is more profitable than shipments from Russia.

2018-06-06,"LONDON, June 6 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Green infrastructure - from more cycle lanes to cleaner air - not only helps the environment but also boosts jobs, health and productivity, according to research released on Wednesday. Spending money on improved public transport could create up to 23 million extra jobs each year, according to researchers at the University of Leeds in Britain. The team analysed more than 700 papers on the impact of low-carbon infrastructure on cities around the world. By turning new and existing buildings into energy-efficient spaces, cities can generate a further 16 million jobs, said the report, which was commissioned by the Coalition for Urban Transitions, a group of think tanks, institutes and universities pushing for more sustainable cities. Investing in cycling routes was also worth between $35 and $136 billion a year in public health benefits, the report added. “As the evidence mounted up, we were struck by the fact that the cities we want - cleaner, healthier, richer - are made possible through climate action,” said lead author of the study, Andy Gouldson, a professor at the University of Leeds. “Whether high-quality public transport or segregated cycling lanes, energy-efficient buildings or better waste management, the dollars, lives and hours saved are impressive,” he said in a statement. Two in three people will be city dwellers by 2050, with the boom concentrated in India, China and Nigeria, according to United Nations estimates released in May. As of today, 55 percent of the world’s population lives in urban areas, increasing to 68 percent by 2050, according to the report on urbanisation by the Population Division of the U.N. Department of Economic and Social Affairs. The world already has 33 megacities - the largest urban hubs - with another 10 megacities expected to take shape by 2030, mostly in developing countries, the UN report said. “Governments face a number of urgent challenges in cities: delivering decent services, ensuring a healthy environment, creating economic opportunities for residents,” said economist Sarah Colenbrander from the Coalition for Urban Transitions. “Low-carbon investment in cities can help meet the needs of residents today, while protecting cities for residents of the future,” she said in a statement.

2018-06-06,"(Repeats with no changes in text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, June 6 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s decision to increase the price of oil for July modestly for its major customers in Asia was a business-as-usual outcome, rather than any signal that the kingdom intends to produce and sell more crude. Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest crude exporter, raised its official selling prices (OSPs) for four of its five grades for July cargoes to Asia, including a 20 cent a barrel increase for the benchmark Arab Light. This took the premium for Arab Light to $2.10 a barrel over regional benchmark Oman-Dubai, the highest in four years. The increase in the OSP for Arab Light was smack in the middle of the range expected by Asian refiners surveyed by Reuters ahead of the announcement. The decision appears to reflect recent price dynamics in the Oman-Dubai market, where the backwardation between the first and third months has widened. In other words, the Saudis did what was expected with the setting of the OSPs for July cargoes. That may sound like a boring outcome, but still speaks volumes for how they view the current state of the market. Saudi Arabia and fellow producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), as well as their allies in a broad deal to cut output, have come under pressure recently from the United States over rising oil prices. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has unofficially requested that the Saudis and other producers raise crude output in order to cap prices, according to three OPEC and industry sources. Brent crude futures briefly popped above $80 a barrel last month, the highest level since November 2014, although they have since retreated somewhat, closing at $75.38 on Tuesday. Part of the reason for the recent jump in crude prices was the decision by Trump to withdraw the United States from the international agreement with Iran to limit the Islamic Republic’s nuclear programme. At the time of the announcement last month, the Trump administration said some countries were willing to increase output in order to compensate for any lost Iranian barrels as the United States reimposes sanctions. While it may well be the case that the Saudis and others are willing to boost production and exports, the OSPs would seem to indicate that this isn’t exactly a huge priority. If the Saudis had wanted to send a clear signal to the market, they could have cut the OSPs. That would have encouraged Asian refiners - who take about two-thirds of the kingdom’s exports - to buy more than their term allocations. Instead, by meeting market expectations on pricing, the Saudis seem to be indicating they are satisfied with the current state of the market, their level of exports and the price they are receiving. And the Saudis may well have cause to be satisfied. Vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts suggests they had a good month in May for exports to China, the world’s biggest crude importer. About 1.13 million barrels per day (bpd) of Saudi crude were discharged in China in May, the biggest month since February 2017, according to data. The strong Chinese imports of Saudi crude came even as the country’s top refiner, Sinopec, had indicated it would buy less Saudi crude over dissatisfaction at increases in the Saudi OSPs that the refiner thought weren’t justified by market fundamentals. For the Saudis, the crude oil market may well be in something of a sweet spot, with prices some 50 percent higher than a year earlier and solid demand from major importers. Additionally, they are receiving help from the United States in combating their major regional rival Iran. And once again, they have shown the market that OPEC is still a force to be reckoned with. The real challenge will be keeping all these different balls in the air at the same time, a juggling act that will be difficult to sustain if history is any guide.

2018-06-06,"LONDON (Reuters) - European refiners are winding down oil purchases from Iran, closing the door on a fifth of the OPEC member’s crude exports after the United States imposed sanctions on Tehran, company and trading sources said. Although European governments have not followed Washington by creating new sanctions, banks, insurers and shippers are gradually severing ties with Iran under pressure from the U.S. restrictions, making trade with Tehran complicated and risky. U.S. President Donald Trump on May 4 announced his decision to quit a landmark 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. The sanctions on Iran’s petroleum sector will take effect after a 180-day “wind-down period” ending on Nov. 4. “We cannot defy the United States,” said a senior source at Italy’s Saras, which operates the 300,000-barrels-per-day (bpd) Sarroch refinery in Sardinia. Saras is determining how best to halt its purchasing of Iranian oil within the permitted 180 days, the source said, adding: “It is not clear yet what the U.S. administration can do but in practice we can get into trouble.” A drop in crude trading between Iran and Europe could complicate efforts by the European signatories of the nuclear deal - France, Germany and Britain - to salvage the agreement. Refiners including France’s Total, Italy’s Eni and Saras, Spain’s Repsol and Cepsa as well as Greece’s Hellenic Petroleum are preparing to halt purchases of Iranian oil once sanctions bite, the sources said. These refiners account for most of Europe’s purchases of Iranian crude, which represent around a fifth of the country’s oil exports.  Iran’s crude sales to foreign buyers averaged around 2.5 million bpd in recent months, according to data collected by Reuters and EU statistics office Eurostat. The bulk of the exports go to Asia. (For a graphic on 'Iranian crude exports' clikc reut.rs/2Jw4ehD) The companies, most of which have long-term contracts with Iran’s national oil company, will continue to purchase cargoes until the sanctions take effect, the sources said. Total, Europe’s largest refiner, does not intend to request a waiver to continue crude oil trading with Iran after Nov. 4, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. That effectively means it will be unable to keep purchasing crude. Eni said it had an oil supply contract outstanding for the purchase of 2 million barrels per month, expiring at the end of the year. Repsol and Hellenic Petroleum declined to comment. “Our trading activity (remains) business as usual ... We continue to strictly conform with European Union and international laws and regulations,” a Cepsa spokesman said. Iranian crude can be substituted by Russian Ural grades, whose prices have risen following the U.S. announcement, as well as crude from Saudi Arabia, trading sources said. (For a graphic on 'Iran's crude oil trade' click reut.rs/2Lq7Jnh) Some of the refiners, including Cepsa, are considering whether to request a waiver from U.S. authorities to continue buying beyond the November deadline in order to complete their term agreements. “With a longer-term contract in place, we’re hoping to get a six-month waiver,” an industry source close to Cepsa said. “From November, we don’t know if any cuts will have to be partial or total.”  Crude trade between Iran and Europe has risen sharply since the lifting of tough sanctions on Tehran in 2015. But banks, shipping firms and insurance companies are now distancing themselves from the Islamic republic, leaving Europe’s refiners few options but to stop oil purchases. “It’s a matter of finding a tanker and an insurer that will cover it. It’s definitely not easy right now,” a source at Repsol said. Hellenic had to stop imports because the Swiss bank that it used was no longer processing payments to Iran, an industry source familiar with the situation said. Asian buyers are also expected to reduce their purchases. India’s Reliance Industries Ltd, owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, plans to halt oil imports from Iran, two sources familiar with the matter said last week.

2018-06-06,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran will not heed a call to cooperate more fully with U.N. nuclear inspectors until a standoff over the future of its agreement with major powers is resolved, its envoy to the agency said on Wednesday. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which is policing the restrictions placed on Iran’s activities under the deal, has said Tehran is implementing its commitments, but also called for “timely and proactive cooperation” on providing access for snap inspections. IAEA chief Yukiya Amano has said the comment is “not an expression of concern or complaints but rather an encouragement to Iran”. Diplomats who deal with the agency, however, say it follows an inspection in late April that went down to the wire in terms of how quickly the IAEA team gained access to one site. Tehran’s ambassador to the IAEA, Reza Najafi, said that, while it was not benefiting from the deal, “no one should expect Iran to go to implement more voluntary measures.” European powers are scrambling to salvage the deal since U.S. President Donald Trump pulled Washington out last month and said he would reimpose far-reaching U.S. sanctions on Iran. The three European powers that signed the deal — France, Britain and Germany — are looking to shield European companies from U.S. sanctions while also keeping Iranian oil exports and the revenue from them flowing. Najafi would not be drawn on exactly how much longer talks between the Europeans and Iran on salvaging the deal would last. “We gave a few weeks to our European counterparts,” he told reporters outside a quarterly meeting of the agency’s Board of Governors. “A few weeks means a few weeks, not a few months.” Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said on Monday he had ordered that preparations be made to increase Iran’s uranium enrichment capacity in case the nuclear deal fell apart. The IAEA said Iran had notified it of a “tentative schedule” to resume long-halted production of uranium hexafluoride, the feedstock for centrifuges, the machines that enrich uranium. The deal caps the level to which Iran can enrich the gas as well as its stock of the enriched material. “But I should emphasize that it does not mean that right now Iran will restart any activities contrary to the JCPOA,” Najafi said, using the deal’s official name - the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. “These are only preparatory works.” Reporting by Francois Murphy; editing by John Stonestreet",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-iaea/iran-says-in-no-mood-to-go-extra-mile-on-nuclear-inspections-idUKL5N1T82TQ,06 Jun 2018,"Iran will not heed a call to

2018-06-06,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Daimler boss Dieter Zetsche will have a follow-up meeting with German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer next Monday, the ministry and the carmaker said on Wednesday, after they met last week to discuss diesel emissions. Global carmakers have faced a regulatory clamp-down since Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted to deliberately cheating diesel emissions tests in 2015. Scheuer questioned Zetsche at a closed-door meeting last week over how many Mercedes-Benz vans and cars need to be fixed after a regulator found illegal software in its Vito vans. German weekly Der Spiegel said there was considerable evidence that diesel engines of the Mercedes C-Class models were also affected. It said on Friday that Scheuer threatened to fine Daimler up to 5,000 euros per affected car, which it said could total 3.75 billion euros ($4.4 billion) if as many as 750,000 vehicles are involved. German weekly Die Zeit on Wednesday cited sources as saying that the number of cars affected could be even higher, at up to 900,000. Die Zeit also said that software updates to Daimler’s diesel vehicles would take until 2020. Initially, the updates were to be completed by the end of 2018, it said.. Daimler declined to comment on how many cars could be affected by the diesel emissions issue or to say how long software updates on the diesel vehicles would take.

2018-06-06,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan’s anti-corruption agency has approved an inquiry into former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and his predecessor Nawaz Sharif over a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal project, the agency said on Wednesday. The news comes less than a week after the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), founded by Sharif, finished its five-year term, handing power to a technocratic caretaker government until elections on July 25. The National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) decision, involving an unidentified terminal is one of the world’s fastest growing LNG markets, is part of a sweeping new initiative targeting senior politicians across the South Asian nation. The national exchequer had suffered a loss of billions of rupees, the NAB said in ordering the inquiry against Abbasi, Sharif and others for granting a 15-year LNG terminal contract “to a company of their liking, in violation of rules and by misuse of their powers”. It did not say which of Pakistan’s two completed terminal projects was referred to. Several more are in the pipeline. Abbasi, who ended PML-N’s term as premier, told Reuters he was unaware of any NAB inquiry, and nobody had contacted him. As petroleum minister when Sharif was premier, Abbasi masterminded Pakistan’s push to embrace LNG after PML-N swept to power in a 2013 election. In a response to Reuters, Abbasi said he took full responsibility for work at the petroleum ministry as Sharif had “no direct responsibility for the workings of my ministry”. He added, “I welcome any inquiry by NAB or any other agency into the affairs of the ministry and I am available to cooperate with any such inquiry.” Text messages and telephone calls to the spokesman of Sharif, who has accused the judiciary of a witch hunt against his party, received no response.     The corruption agency also approved an inquiry against Sharif’s brother Shehbaz, formerly the chief minister of the vast eastern province of Punjab, who is seen as the favourite to fight the next election as PML-N’s prime ministerial candidate.

2018-06-06,"(Reuters) - European plastic packaging leader RPC (RPC.L) is stepping up investments to take advantage of strong demand in China, betting that its scale and technological know-how will allow it to take share from rivals even as recycling regulations bite. However, shares in RPC were set for their worst day in a decade as the investments hit free cash flow and RPC said it would spend to expand manufacturing of its products, which include bottle caps and industrial chemical containers. Full-year free cash flow fell 4 percent to 229 million pounds, the company said on Wednesday. Capital investments of 242 million or 6 percent of revenues were above its guidance for 230 million and were also set to rise to 250 million this year. “Yes, we are investing a significant amount of capex but I think it’s in the higher added-value return,” Chief Executive Pim Vervaat told analysts on a call. “I think we can take share from less well invested and less innovative competitors.” Shares in RPC fell as much as 17 percent to a more than two-year low. By 1045 GMT they were trading down 12 percent, at the bottom of the pan-European Stoxx 600  index and were on course for their worst day since October 2008. “The plastics industry is one in which governments and the public are newly focused, there are some questions about underlying growth,” said Paul Moran, Head of Research for Northern Trust Capital Markets, maintaining a”sell” recommendation on the stock.  Packaging markets are going through upheaval after China this year stopped accepting some lower-grade materials for recycling, while tighter regulation looms in Europe and elsewhere. UK-based RPC said none of the products it makes will be restricted by a planned European Union directive or British restrictions on single use plastics, and that little immediate impact was anticipated. RPC Chairman James Pike added that customers were not moving away from plastic but were showing increasing interest in recyclable products, playing to its design strengths. Among other projects, RPC is investing 35 million pounds in a new factory in Shanghai, as Chinese demand for food and medical packaging soars, sending RPC’s sales in China up by an average of 26 percent a year since 2014/15. RPC, which has spent over $1.5 billion (1 billion pounds) on acquisitions in the past two years, said it would evaluate buying opportunities, while it identified businesses for sale that do not fit its focus on high-value recyclable plastics. The businesses slated for disposal are a European automotive injection-moulding unit, its U.S. Letica food-packaging business, which is primarily paper-based, and a metal-based spirits bottle-top business. The three have a total of 209 million pounds in revenues. RPC reported a 38 percent jump in annual adjusted operating profit, in line with analysts’ expectations. RPC said it aimed to improve adjusted operating profit of its core businesses, including its recent Nordfolien acquisition, by at least 50 million pounds by 2021, and for its organic revenue to grow faster than the wider economy.

2018-06-06,"LONDON (Reuters) - Wales has offered 200 million pounds ($268 million) in funding to help build the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon ahead of a UK government decision on whether to fund the 1.3 billion pound renewable energy project.  Britain is considering building what would be the world’s first such project - a 9.5 km (6 mile) horseshoe-shaped sea wall to capture tidal power - in part to replace aging coal and nuclear plants set to close in the 2020s as well as cut carbon emissions.  But the project’s costs have cast doubt on its viability, despite the backing of an independent government-commissioned review last year carried out by former energy minister Charles Hendry.  The offer to provide a loan or to take an equity stake came from the Welsh Assembly and was made by Wales First Minister Carwyn Jones in a letter to British Business Minister Greg Clark. It also called for a minimum price guarantee for the electricity the project produces of 92.50 pounds per megawatt hour, the same as that awarded to France’s EDF for power from the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant project.  A spokesman for Britain’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it was considering the findings of the Hendry review, and that an “announcement will be made in due course”. Project developer Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay Plc said it hoped the UK government would look positively on the proposed joint funding deal.  “The proposal for a joint deal with this structure is extremely constructive. We are eager to engage on it with all parties and it is a proposal we’d be delighted to take to our Board,” Tidal Lagoon Chairman Keith Clarke said in a statement.  The project in south Wales was due to start construction in 2018 and is expected to take four years to complete.  When the tide drops, the difference between water levels inside and outside the lagoon causes water to pass through turbines to produce electricity. Similarly, when the tide rises, power would be generated as water fills the lagoon. While tidal changes have been harnessed before to generate power, mostly deploying a barrage across a stretch of water, this would be the first to enclose it, effectively creating a man-made lagoon.

2018-06-06,"SYDNEY/BANGKOK/MONTREAL (Reuters) - A growing shortage of airline pilots is putting the industry’s recent growth at risk as planes sit idle, higher salaries cut into profits and unions across the globe push for more benefits. Carriers such as Emirates and Australia’s Qantas Airways (QAN.AX) have poured resources into hiring, but struggled in recent months to use their jets as often as their business plans dictate because of training bottlenecks. Pilots at Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) are forming unions across Europe seeking better working conditions, and those at Air France (AIRF.PA) are striking over pay. In the United States, pilots who took pay cuts when carriers went bankrupt a decade ago are receiving big raises under new contracts now that airlines are posting strong profits. The surge in employee costs, which rival fuel as the biggest strain on an airline’s finances, comes as higher oil prices are already squeezing margins. Airlines say ticket prices have not kept pace with costs. “These cost pressures are not about to stop imminently,” International Air Transport Association (IATA) chief economist Brian Pearce said at the trade group’s annual meeting in Sydney, where IATA lowered its airline profit forecast by 12 percent, citing higher fuel and labor costs. “It’s the symptom of a wider issue. If we look at developed economies, unemployment in the OECD has fallen to lows and we are starting to get wage pressures, of which pilot shortages are a symptom in our industry,” he told airline bosses, many of whom expressed concern about a shortage on the sidelines of the IATA annual meeting this week. Inflation is beginning to take hold in OECD economies after years of lying dormant, and pilot wages also reflect that, Pearce added. The high cost of pilot training and several years of earlier hiring freezes in markets like the United States and Australia have deterred potential aviators from entering an industry that Boeing says will need 637,000 more pilots over the next 20 years.  IATA estimates airline traffic will nearly double during that period, so companies like Canadian training group CAE Inc (CAE.TO) and L3 Technologies (LLL.N) are building new flight simulators to cash in on training demand. Planemakers Airbus and Boeing are also expanding into services like training, where margins are potentially higher than building jets. And some airlines are planning to expand in-house training programs. Qantas says it will invest A$20 million ($15.26 million) in a new flying school to ensure a supply of pilots amid high turnover in its regional arm QantasLink. Emirates opened a $135 million fight training academy in November for up to 600 cadets. “We have a social responsibility,” Qantas Domestic CEO Andrew David said. “We can continue to take pilots from smaller players in this country and elsewhere but we need to give back and that is part of what we are doing here as well.” Other airlines are having to look outside their home markets, competing with China, where experienced foreign captains are in high demand and airlines offer annual salaries of up to $314,000 - tax free. “There is not so much a shortage of pilots as a rising cost of attracting and retaining the pilots you need, particularly the experienced ones,” said Andrew Herdman, director general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines. “There is a bidding war going on.” In countries where average wages are relatively low, pilots are being offered much cushier pay packages than other professions because they are internationally mobile and must  speak English, the global language of aviation. SriLankan Airlines has lost a “steady trickle” of pilots to Gulf carriers, SriLankan CEO Suren Ratwatte, who was an Emirates pilot, told Reuters. “We pay pretty well because the pilots going (away from the company) go mainly to the Middle East, and we tend to get very close to Gulf salaries except (we are) living in Sri Lanka,” he said. “Your lifestyle is pretty decent.” Thailand’s Bangkok Airways PCL (BA.BK) is raising pilot salaries and benefits and hiring foreigners for international flying, President Puttipong Prasarttong-Osot said.  Pilot unions are taking advantage of shortages to ask for better conditions for their members. Dan Adamus, president of the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) Canada, said Canadian pilots are generally getting pay raises, although salaries at U.S. mainline carriers are higher than at Air Canada (AC.TO).  “It’s certainly harder for airlines to recruit qualified pilots,” he said, which has led carriers to raise pay. “The pilots are going to go where there is better pay.” He estimates that about 1,000 Canadian pilots are flying for carriers overseas such as Emirates. Airlines considered top employers in their home country, such as Qantas and IAG-owned British Airways, are not yet facing shortages of qualified applicants.  IAG (ICAG.L) Chief Executive Willie Walsh, a former pilot at Ireland’s Aer Lingus, said that there were signs of “pinch points” within the broader industry but that he did not believe there was a shortage. “The day you see me back flying is the day you know there’s a pilot shortage,” he said.

Robust growth is making the central bank increasingly confident that inflation is on its way back to target, ECB chief economist Peter Praet said on Wednesday, increasing the likelihood it may use a meeting next week to reveal more about the end of its bond-buying programme. Praet’s comments supported the euro, that rose 0.3 percent to 1.1747. Bonds sold off, with the yield on Germany’s benchmark 10-year bond back above 0.4 percent, and was last up 4 basis points on the day. Europe’s benchmark Stoxx 600 index was flat, with interest-rate-sensitive utilities stocks among the top fallers, down 0.5 percent Italian stocks were a notable underperformer, falling 1.4 percent. Investors said the new government’s big-spending fiscal plans, a major worry for markets over the last few weeks, were unlikely to be helped by the ECB tightening its own policy. Italian borrowing costs also rose more than most in Europe, with the 10-year yield up 15 basis points to 2.91 percent “Profligate ECB bond buying in the face of profligate Italian fiscal policy is an interesting conflict,” said Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management. “We believe the bond buying programme will conclude by the end of this year.” MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.24 percent, mainly as a result of a strong showing from Asian stocks. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.63 percent. The euro’s rise put pressure on the U.S. dollar index , that measures performance against six major currencies, with the main weighting given to the euro. The index fell 0.27 percent. The Mexican peso steadied on Wednesday, after falling to its weakest since February 2017 late on Tuesday after the United States raised the possibility of turning negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement into bilateral talks. Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow also revived the possibility that the president will seek to replace NAFTA with bilateral deals with Canada and Mexico. The threat of rising trade protectionism has already taken a toll on global trade and could increase risks to growth, ANZ analysts Daniel Been and Giulia Lavinia Specchia said in a note. “Against this backdrop, we believe financial markets will become even more sensitive to bad news,” they wrote, while recommending a defensive stance on risk-taking. Most other emerging currencies strengthened against the dollar, already lower versus the strong euro. MSCI’s emerging market currency index ticked higher, rising 0.1 percent. Oil prices rose on Wednesday after Venezuela raised the prospect of a halt to some crude exports, but gains were capped by reports that the U.S. government had asked Saudi Arabia and some other OPEC producers to increase output. Brent crude rose 0.6 percent to $75.86 per barrel.

2018-06-06,"PARIS, June 6 (Reuters) - France’s FIEV car equipment lobby group has cancelled a July trip to Iran in light of current tensions between the United States and other European powers over a 2015 Iran nuclear deal. “The trip has been cancelled and replaced instead by a meeting in France of our Iran club, so that we can reflect upon how to proceed in light of current events,” said FIEV president Jacques Mauge. Tensions between Iran and the West have surged since President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran last month, calling it deeply flawed and reimposing unilateral sanctions. European powers are scrambling to save the deal - under which Iran curbed its nuclear programme in return for a lifting of international sanctions - as they regard it as the best chance to stop Tehran developing an atomic bomb. Earlier this month, Peugeot-maker PSA Group said it had begun to suspend its joint venture activities in Iran to avoid U.S. sanctions after Washington’s withdrawal from the international nuclear deal.

2018-06-06,"(Repeats to attach to alert) By Osamu Tsukimori YOKOHAMA, Japan, June 6 (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc’s Cove Point liquefied natural gas production facility in the eastern United States will undergo a brief maintenance shutdown in the autumn, the company’s top executive said on Wednesday. “It’s not very long,” Dominion’s Chief Executive Officer Thomas Farrell said in an interview, adding the outage could be for less than a few weeks. Asked whether there would be any interruption in LNG exports from the site on the coast of the state of Maryland, Farrell said that would depend on whether gas storage tanks with capacity to hold nearly 15 billion cubic feet of the commodity were exhausted. Farrell was in Yokohama to attend a ceremony to celebrate last month’s start of Japanese imports of Cove Point LNG and the arrival of a second Cove Point LNG vessel at a Tokyo Gas terminal on Wednesday morning. The imports, via a long-term contract, mark a shift in global energy flows as the United States boosts oil and gas exports from shale formations. A ramp-up of U.S. goods purchases by Japan may draw some of the sting from President Donald Trump’s criticisms of the Asian nation’s trade imbalance with the United States. The Cove Point facility, with a nameplate annual capacity of 5.25 million tonnes of LNG, has been at full production of LNG from natural gas since April, Farrell said. “You’ll see a very significant increase in U.S. natural gas coming to Asia and in particular Japan,” he said. “Shale drilling techniques have unlocked probably 200 years ... of natural gas that we will be exporting toward our allies across the world for decades and decades.” Dominion sold the project’s capacity for 20 years to a subsidiary of GAIL (India) and to ST Cove Point, a joint venture between units of Japanese trading company Sumitomo Corp and Tokyo Gas. Tokyo Gas has a contract to buy 1.4 million tonnes a year of Cove Point LNG for 20 years, while Kansai Electric Power has contracted to take 800,000 tonnes a year. There are no plans to build additional trains at the Cove Point terminal because there is no land available, Farrell added. Asked whether there are any plans for similar LNG export projects elsewhere, he said: “That’s possible, but that would be in the future. We don’t have any present plans to do that”.

2018-06-06,"* Shanghai, Dalian bourses hope to draw global investors * Shanghai exchange also looking to offices in Hong Kong, Dubai * ShFE plans to internationalise copper, steel rebar futures next By Florence Tan SINGAPORE, June 6 (Reuters) - Two of China’s largest commodity exchanges have set up offices in Singapore, as they push to reach global investors via their first overseas outposts. Shanghai Futures Exchange on Tuesday officially opened a Singapore representative office under its Shanghai International Energy Exchange arm, which launched China’s first crude oil futures contract in March. “This is another significant step for (the bourse) as it opens up to the world,” Jiang Yan, chairman of the board at the ShFE, said at the opening ceremony. “Singapore is an important commodities trading and financial hub globally and is an important link in China’s One Belt One Road initiative.” The ShFE hopes to receive approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore in the next couple of months to market its products in the city state, Jiang said. Meanwhile, Dalian which recently opened up its iron ore futures to overseas investors, has set up a representative office in Singapore, an official from the bourse said. He declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media. Elsewhere, the ShFE has registered with Hong Kong regulators and is looking at setting up offices there and in Dubai, as well as planning to collaborate with foreign exchanges to boost trade volumes, Jiang said. In addition to crude oil, the exchange is also working on opening up its copper and steel rebar futures to global investors, he added. In China, the exchange is looking at how it could use the free trade zone on the island province of Hainan for the delivery of physical commodities, Jiang said. ShFE, set up in 1999, has increased the number of products offered on the exchange to 15 from three, covering metals, energy and petrochemicals. The Dalian exchange lists agricultural, metals and petrochemicals products. Singapore is the third-largest commodities trading hub in the world, generating $1.3 trillion in turnover last year, according to MAS. Reporting by Florence Tan

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.7 percent. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.4 percent. European spreadbetters predicted shares there would shake off concerns over Italian debt and open broadly higher as tech stocks globally continue to rise. Britain’s FTSE was seen opening 0.1 percent higher, Germany’s DAX gaining 0.2 percent and France’s CAC up 0.3 percent. A firmer-than-expected print on first quarter growth lifted Australian stocks by half a percent. The Nasdaq closed at a record high for the second day in a row on Tuesday with help from the technology and consumer discretionary sectors, aided by the upbeat outlook for the U.S. economy. But the S&P 500 dipped, with the financial sector hit by lower Treasury yields, which can reduce banks’ profits. Treasury yields fell as investors moved back into safe-haven government debt after Italy’s new Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte vowed to enact economic policies that could add to the nation’s already-heavy debt load. On the other hand, the debt concerns caused Italian government bond yields to rise again after they had declined to one-week lows on Monday. “The Italian political situation will remain uncertain, and considering its potential impact on European Central Bank policy, market volatility could continue to be relatively high,” said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. The currency market’s response to comments from the new Italian prime minister was more positive, with the euro gaining after Conte said the government had no plans to leave the euro zone. The euro was a shade higher at $1.1723 after gaining about 0.2 percent overnight. The currency had fallen to a 10-month low of $1.1510 on May 29 on worries about Italy exiting the euro zone. The lingering concerns over tit-for-tat trade tariffs and the risk of a bigger global trade war remained in the background, weighing on investor sentiment. In the latest developments, Mexico imposed tariffs on a range of American products, retaliating for U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision last week to remove an exemption on steel and aluminium for allies Mexico, Canada and the European Union. Trump economic advisor Larry Kudlow also revived the possibility that the president will seek to replace NAFTA with bilateral deals with Canada and Mexico. The threat of rising trade protectionism has already taken a toll on global trade and could increase risks to growth, ANZ analysts Daniel Been and Giulia Lavinia Specchia said in a note. “Against this backdrop, we believe financial markets will become even more sensitive to bad news,” they wrote, while recommending a defensive stance on risk-taking. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was almost unchanged at 93.83. The U.S. currency was little changed at 109.90 yen after being nudged off a near two-week high above 110.00 scaled the previous day as U.S. yields fell overnight. The Australian dollar was just off highs of $0.7665. It gained a quarter of a U.S. cent after data showed Australia’s economy grew 1.0 percent in the first three months of this year from the preceding quarter, beating market expectations. The 10-year Treasury note yield was at 2.9269 percent , having pulled back from a 10-day high of 2.946 percent scaled on Monday. In commodities, Brent crude futures were up 26 cents at $75.63 a barrel. The contract went as low as $73.81, the weakest since May 8, the previous day after a report that the U.S. government had asked Saudi Arabia and other major exporters to increase oil output.

2018-06-06,"PAHOA, Hawaii (Reuters) - A growing river of molten rock flowing from a fissure at the foot of Kilauea Volcano is believed to have demolished scores of additional homes and filled in a small bay at the eastern tip of Hawaii’s Big Island, civil defence officials said on Tuesday. The latest estimates - up to 80 more structures than previously counted as destroyed by lava smothering two newly evacuated subdivisions - could bring the total number of homes and other buildings lost over the past month to nearly 200. Such a tally would put property losses from the current upheaval of Kilauea, which entered its 34th day on Tuesday, on par with the 215 structures destroyed by lava during all 35 years of the volcano’s last eruption cycle, which began in 1983. The Hawaii County Civil Defence agency was putting the confirmed number of buildings lost to the current eruption at 117 on Monday, mostly residential properties. About 80 of those were destroyed in the Leilani Estates community, where lava-spouting fissures in the ground first opened on May 3 downhill from the volcano’s eastern flank. Another three-dozen homes were confirmed destroyed at the weekend when a large lava stream creeping 6 miles (10 km) across the landscape reached the far eastern edge of the Big Island, pouring into the ocean at Kapoho Bay. A civil defence official told Reuters on Tuesday at least 60 to 80 more homes were believed to have been devoured as the lava flow, measuring about half a mile wide and 10 to 15 feet (3-4.6 meters) tall, inundated the adjacent subdivisions of Kapoho Beach Lots and Vacationland. The official said aerial surveillance of the area showed only the northern portion of Kapoho Beach and the southernmost “sliver” of Vacationland - the latter consisting of only about half a dozen homes - were left unscathed. Civil defence spokeswoman Janet Snyder said later county tax records show the two subdivisions consist of 279 homes combined and that “many of those 279 homes are feared destroyed.” She said it would be some time before precise losses were confirmed. Video footage from a helicopter showed two seaside homes engulfed in flames as clouds of white steam and hydrochloric acid fumes billowed from the water, where red-hot lava was pouring into the ocean. Civil defence officials said Kapoho Bay itself had been filled in with lava that extended seven-tenths of a mile from what had been the shoreline. “What used to be the bay is now all lava bed, new land, almost a mile out into the ocean,” the civil defence spokesman said. Authorities began evacuating the greater Kapoho area last week and ushered most of the last remaining residents to safety early on Saturday, hours before the lava flow severed all road access to the region. Several holdouts were airlifted by helicopter on Sunday, leaving no more than a handful of people who refused to leave, officials said. Barbara McDaniel, a retiree who moved with her husband to Vacationland from Washington state five years ago, said they fled as soon as evacuations began, taking little else but their dog and cat with them. They worried their house would be spared by the lava but rendered inaccessible, leaving them stuck with the mortgage for an abandoned home and a fire insurance policy that was of no value, she told Reuters. “Right now, I’m hoping that it burns down,” she said. “If lava takes it, we’re covered.” Additional reporting and writing by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Sandra Maler and Paul Tait",https://uk.reuters.com/article/hawaii-volcano/update-1-scores-more-homes-destroyed-by-lava-flow-on-hawaiis-big-island-idUKL2N1T8067,06 Jun 2018,"A growing river of molten

2018-06-06,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has some of the worst air pollution in the world and smog levels often spike during its sweltering summers, when smoke-belching diesel generators are used to offset power shortages, as air-conditioners and fans stoke consumption. But a team of Indian engineers has figured out how to capture some of the generator exhaust and turn it into ink, keeping the emissions from entering the atmosphere. They say they have created the first-ever device to capture emissions specifically from diesel generators - a welcome invention for a country that has 14 of the world’s 15 most polluted cities, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. “We are aiming to bring down pollution levels in the major cities by a very significant percentage in a very short span of time,” said Arpit Dhupar, one of three engineers who developed the technology now installed in Gurugram, a satellite city of New Delhi, the capital. Their device attaches to generators to capture up to 90 percent of soot particles from cooled diesel exhaust. The material can then be sold to ink manufacturers. Their company, Chakr Innovation, has installed 53 devices in government firms and offices, as well as real estate developers, Dhupar said, saving 1,500 billion liters of air from pollution. It has collected over 500 kg (1,102 lb) of soot, which has been used to create more than 20,000 liters of ink, he added.  Chakr Innovations is not the first start-up to see cash in diesel exhaust. A competitor called Graviky Labs, based in the southern city of Bangalore, is using similar technology to turn diesel exhaust from vehicles into ink. About 1.1 million people die each year from the effects of India’s air pollution, a 2015 survey by the U.S.-based Health Effects Institute showed, accounting for about a quarter of total air pollution deaths worldwide.

2018-06-06,"HOUSTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - OPEC member Venezuela has raised the prospect of declaring force majeure on contracts with major crude buyers amid plummeting output from its oil fields and tanker bottlenecks at ports, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Falling production from Venezuela has contributed to a rally in global oil prices CLc1 LCOc1 to a near four-year high, and other OPEC members may boost output at a meeting later this month to compensate for the shortfall and other risks to global supplies. Oil is the financial lifeline for the embattled socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro, but his cash-strapped administration has failed to invest enough in the industry to prevent its decline.  Venezuela’s state-owned oil firm PDVSA has told some customers that they must send vessels equipped to accept ship-to-ship oil transfers rather than load at its ports. If they do not accept the terms, PDVSA is considering force majeure, in essence declaring its contracts incapable of being fulfilled, the sources familiar with the matter said.  It has separately begun notifying all its customers that it will no longer receive new tankers for loading at Jose or Paraguana, its main export terminals, until ships already in line are served. Most customers have so far refused the ship-to-ship transfer request due to the lack of a third party supervising the operations, according to shippers and traders. Additional costs for completing the transfer also contributed to the refusals.  PDVSA has been using sanctions imposed on the company by U.S. President Donald Trump as a rationale for the change, according to one of the sources. Venezuela’s export terminals have grown overcrowded since U.S. oil firm ConocoPhillips (COP.N) last month won court orders freezing PDVSA’s key Caribbean operations, where the Venezuelan company used to ship large cargoes to Asian destinations. There were more than 70 tankers off the coast of Venezuela on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters vessel tracking data.      “We are going to try the ship-to-ship idea first,” the source familiar with the matter said.  “Many customers are going to prefer this than continuing to accumulate demurrage,” the source added, referring to fees charged for long waiting times.  One of PDVSA’s Indian customers confirmed it had received a request to load its cargoes via ship-to-ship transfers. The buyer so far has refused to accept the new terms, said an employee who was not authorized to speak publicly and requested anonymity.  Traders and shippers were skeptical that the transfers would succeed in easing the bottlenecks. PDVSA will still have to load vessels at its Jose port for transporting the crude to its proposed offshore loading facility, and production declines are not expected to reverse.  Very large vessels that typically do not approach Venezuela’s western coast are now visible from Paraguana Refining Center (CRP), according to a worker from the facility.    PDVSA did not reply to a request for comment. PDVSA knew it would fall short of contracted deliveries this year because of declining output and set a goal to limit the gap, according to internal company documents reviewed by Reuters. But the firm missed even that lowered target.  “There’s an average deficit of 422,000 barrels per day (bpd) between real and planned production so far this year,” according to one of the documents. In April, the company shipped 1.49 million bpd of crude and fuels to its customers - 665,000 bpd below the 2.15 million bpd contracted, the documents show. The firm shorted deliveries to 12 of 14 major customers with long-term crude supply contracts, the records show. The shortfall, which has not been previously reported, shed new light on the depth of the company’s problems extracting and refining crude - despite repeated promises by Maduro and PDVSA President Manuel Quevedo to grow 2018 production by 1 million bpd. The state-owned firm in April had so little oil it failed to deliver almost all of the crude it promised to its U.S. refining unit, Citgo Petroleum, under a 273,000-bpd contract, the documents show.      Venezuela’s exports of crude declined 28 percent in the first four months of 2018 to 1.19 million bpd compared with 1.65 million bpd in the same period last year, according to Reuters trade flows data.  In January-April, crude output fell to 1.62 million bpd, the lowest annual average in over three decades Aggravating its export problems, Conoco last month started seizing PDVSA’s terminals, oil inventories and cargoes in the Caribbean to enforce a $2 billion arbitration award in a dispute over the socialist government’s nationalisation of the U.S. oil producer’s Venezuela assets.

2018-06-06,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, June 6 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s decision to increase the price of oil for July modestly for its major customers in Asia was a business-as-usual outcome, rather than any signal that the kingdom intends to produce and sell more crude. Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest crude exporter, raised its official selling prices (OSPs) for four of its five grades for July cargoes to Asia, including a 20 cent a barrel increase for the benchmark Arab Light. This took the premium for Arab Light to $2.10 a barrel over regional benchmark Oman-Dubai, the highest in four years. The increase in the OSP for Arab Light was smack in the middle of the range expected by Asian refiners surveyed by Reuters ahead of the announcement. The decision appears to reflect recent price dynamics in the Oman-Dubai market, where the backwardation between the first and third months has widened. In other words, the Saudis did what was expected with the setting of the OSPs for July cargoes. That may sound like a boring outcome, but still speaks volumes for how they view the current state of the market. Saudi Arabia and fellow producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), as well as their allies in a broad deal to cut output, have come under pressure recently from the United States over rising oil prices. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has unofficially requested that the Saudis and other producers raise crude output in order to cap prices, according to three OPEC and industry sources. Brent crude futures briefly popped above $80 a barrel last month, the highest level since November 2014, although they have since retreated somewhat, closing at $75.38 on Tuesday. Part of the reason for the recent jump in crude prices was the decision by Trump to withdraw the United States from the international agreement with Iran to limit the Islamic Republic’s nuclear programme. At the time of the announcement last month, the Trump administration said some countries were willing to increase output in order to compensate for any lost Iranian barrels as the United States reimposes sanctions. While it may well be the case that the Saudis and others are willing to boost production and exports, the OSPs would seem to indicate that this isn’t exactly a huge priority. If the Saudis had wanted to send a clear signal to the market, they could have cut the OSPs. That would have encouraged Asian refiners - who take about two-thirds of the kingdom’s exports - to buy more than their term allocations. Instead, by meeting market expectations on pricing, the Saudis seem to be indicating they are satisfied with the current state of the market, their level of exports and the price they are receiving. And the Saudis may well have cause to be satisfied. Vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts suggests they had a good month in May for exports to China, the world’s biggest crude importer. About 1.13 million barrels per day (bpd) of Saudi crude were discharged in China in May, the biggest month since February 2017, according to data. The strong Chinese imports of Saudi crude came even as the country’s top refiner, Sinopec, had indicated it would buy less Saudi crude over dissatisfaction at increases in the Saudi OSPs that the refiner thought weren’t justified by market fundamentals. For the Saudis, the crude oil market may well be in something of a sweet spot, with prices some 50 percent higher than a year earlier and solid demand from major importers. Additionally, they are receiving help from the United States in combating their major regional rival Iran. And once again, they have shown the market that OPEC is still a force to be reckoned with. The real challenge will be keeping all these different balls in the air at the same time, a juggling act that will be difficult to sustain if history is any guide.

2018-06-06,"PAHOA, Hawaii, June 5 (Reuters) - A growing river of molten rock flowing from a fissure at the foot of Kilauea Volcano is believed to have demolished scores of additional homes and filled in a small bay at the eastern tip of Hawaii’s Big Island, civil defense officials said on Tuesday. The latest estimates — up to 80 more structures than previously counted as destroyed by lava smothering two newly evacuated subdivisions — could bring the total number of homes and other buildings lost over the past month to nearly 200. Such a tally would put property losses from the current upheaval of Kilauea, which entered its 34th day on Tuesday, on par with 215 structures destroyed by lava during all 35 years of the volcano’s last eruption cycle, which began in 1983. On Monday, the Hawaii County Civil Defense agency was putting the confirmed number of buildings lost to the current eruption at 117, mostly residential properties. About 80 of those were destroyed in the Leilani Estates community, where lava-spouting fissures in the ground first opened on May 3 downhill from the volcano’s eastern flank. Another three-dozen homes were confirmed destroyed this past weekend when a large lava stream creeping 6 miles (9.7 km) across the landscape reached the far eastern edge of the Big Island, pouring into the ocean at a place called Kapoho Bay. On Tuesday, a civil defense official told Reuters that at least 60 to 80 more homes were believed to have been devoured as the lava flow, measuring about a half-mile (80-meter) wide and 10 to 15 feet (3 to 4.6 meter) tall, inundated the adjacent subdivisions of Kapoho Beach Lots and Vacationland. The official said aerial surveillance of the area showed only the northern portion of Kapoho Beach and the southernmost “sliver” of Vacationland — the latter consisting of only about a half-dozen homes — were left unscathed. Vivian Mark, a resident of Hilo who owns a beachfront vacation rental in Vacationland and is president of the Vacationland Hawaii Community Association, said Vacationland consisted of 240 housing lots and nearly 90 farm lots, but she was unsure how many of those had properties built on them. Video footage from a helicopter flying over the area showed two seaside homes engulfed in flames, as clouds of white steam and hydrochloric acid fumes billowed from the water where red-hot lava was pouring into the ocean. Civil defense officials said Kapoho Bay itself had been filled in with lava that extended seven-tenths of a mile (1.1 km) from what had been the shoreline. “What used to be the bay is now all lava bed, new land, almost a mile (1.6 km) out into the ocean,” the civil defense spokesman told Reuters. Authorities began evacuating the greater Kapoho area last week and ushered most of the last remaining residents to safety early on Saturday, hours before the lava flow severed all road access to the region. Several holdouts were airlifted by helicopter on Sunday, leaving no more than a handful of people who refused to leave, officials said. The lava inundating Kapoho is emanating from Fissure 8, the only volcanic vent that was still belching large volumes of molten rock from the ground as of Tuesday, officials said.

2018-06-06,"(Reuters) - The Trump administration has indefinitely delayed a proposed overhaul of U.S. biofuels policy aimed at reducing costs for the oil industry, under pressure from corn state lawmakers who worry the move would undermine demand for ethanol, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The White House had been poised to announce the reforms to the U.S. Renewable Fuel Program early this week after hosting months of difficult negotiations between representatives of the key constituencies. “The announcement won’t be happening,” one of the sources said. The second source said the deal had apparently collapsed. Both sources asked not to be identified discussing the matter. The RFS requires oil refiners to mix increasing volumes of biofuels like ethanol into the nation’s fuel each year, and prove compliance by earning or acquiring blending credits that must be handed in to the Environmental Protection Agency. The law has helped Midwest corn farmers by creating a 15-billion-gallon-a-year market for ethanol, but refining companies have complained it incurs steep costs for them. The White House deal would have eased pressure on the refining industry by allowing biofuels exports to count toward the annual volumes quotas. It would also have expanded sales of high-ethanol gasoline in a concession to biofuels producers. Republican Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa both praised President Donald Trump on Twitter on Tuesday evening. “@realDonaldTrump has said he loooovves the farmers! #Iowa is feeling that love today, as the President just assured me he ‘won’t sign a deal that’s bad for farmers!’ Thank you Mr. President,” wrote Ernst. “Pres Trump helped farmers by rejecting bad ethanol deal. I appreciate. GREAT NEWS,” wrote Grassley. Bob Dinneen, head of the Renewable Fuels Association, said: “We are happy the President continues to recognize the importance of our industry to America’s farmers and rural economies across the nation.”     Reporting by Jarrett Renshaw and Chris Prentice in New York; Writing by Richard Valdmanis; Editing by Peter Cooney",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-biofuels/trump-administration-biofuels-deal-delayed-indefinitely-sources-idUKL5N1T8035,06 Jun 2018,"The Trump administration has indefinitely

2018-06-06,"TOKYO, June 6 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices edged up in early Asian trade on Wednesday to move away from lows hit in the previous session, buoyed after industry data showed a decline in U.S. crude inventories. U.S. crude marked its lowest level in nearly two months on Tuesday after three OPEC and industry sources said the U.S. government has unofficially asked Saudi Arabia and some other OPEC producers to raise oil output, although it has not requested a specific figure. But U.S. oil had rebounded by Tuesday’s close amid expectations U.S. crude oil stockpiles likely fell for a second week last week. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was up 10 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $65.62 a barrel by 0020 GMT on Wednesday, having settled up 77 cents. It touched a near two-month low of $64.22 on Tuesday. Brent crude was down 8 cents, or 0.1 percent, at $75.30 a barrel, after settling up 9 cents the session before. On Tuesday, it hit its lowest since May 8 at $73.81. U.S. crude inventories fell by 2 million barrels, compared with analyst expectations for a decrease of 1.8 million barrels, American Petroleum Institute data showed after Tuesday’s settlement. Gasoline stocks rose by 3.8 million barrels, compared with analyst expectations for a 587,000-barrel gain. Distillate fuels stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 871,000 barrels, compared with expectations for a 784,000-barrel gain. The market is waiting for a report by the U.S. Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration at 1430 GMT. Meanwhile, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Tuesday that oil demand should determine how OPEC and non-OPEC countries should adjust a current deal on oil output curbs. Reuters reported on May 25 that the producers were considering a supply increase of 1 million bpd, with a final decision to be made at the June 22-23 meeting in Vienna of OPEC and non-OPEC ministers. Elsewhere, Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA has notified major customers it would declare force majeure on crude contracts unless they agree to accept ship-to-ship transfers, according to people familiar with the matter. Mexican oil output could return to 2 million barrels per day (bpd) by about 2022 from 1.886 million bpd in April if the next government pursues plans to auction off development blocs to private investors, Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell said on Tuesday.

2018-06-06,"* MSCI Asia-Pacific index up 0.1 pct, Nikkei dips 0.1 pct * Tech sector strength takes Nasdaq to record high * Euro supported as new Italy PM rules out euro zone exit * But new Italy PM also stirs debt concerns By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, June 6 (Reuters) - Asian stocks edged up on Wednesday after tech sector strength lifted Wall Street shares, while concerns about Italy’s debt prompted investors to move into lower-risk government debt elsewhere, pushing U.S. Treasury yields down from recent highs. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.1 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei edged down 0.1 percent. Australian stocks rose 0.3 percent. The Nasdaq closed at a record high for the second day in a row on Tuesday with help from the technology and consumer discretionary sectors amid an upbeat outlook for the U.S. economy. But the S&P 500 dipped, with the financial sector hit by lower Treasury yields, which can reduce banks’ profits. Treasury yields fell as investors moved back into safe-haven government debt after Italy’s new Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte vowed to enact economic policies that could add to the nation’s already-heavy debt load. On the other hand, the debt concerns caused Italian government bond yields to rise again after they had declined to one-week lows on Monday. “The Italian political situation will remain uncertain, and considering its potential impact on European Central Bank policy, market volatility could continue to relatively high,” said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. The currency market’s response to comments from the new Italian prime minister was more positive, with the euro gaining after Conte said the government had no plans to leave the euro zone. The euro was a shade higher at $1.1724 after gaining about 0.2 percent overnight. The currency had fallen to a 10-month low of $1.1510 on May 29 on worries about Italy exiting the euro zone. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies fell 0.1 percent to 93.833. The U.S. currency was little changed at 109.850 yen after being nudged off a near two-week high above 100.00 scaled the previous day as U.S. yields fell overnight. The 10-year Treasury note yield was at 2.929 percent , having pulled back from a 10-day high of 2.946 percent scaled on Monday. In commodities, Brent crude futures were down 8 cents at $75.30 a barrel. The contract went as low as $73.81, the weakest since May 8, the previous day after a report that the U.S. government had asked Saudi Arabia and other major exporters to increase oil output.

2018-06-06,"(Adds Petrobras comment, paragraph 6) RIO DE JANEIRO, June 5 (Reuters) - Brazilian oil regulator ANP said on Tuesday it would seek public comment over a period of several weeks on a potential rule that could set limits on how often fuel prices change in the country. The comment period, which will take place from June 11 to July 2, follows a nationwide trucker strike over diesel price hikes last month that paralyzed much of Latin America’s biggest economy. In an emailed statement, ANP said the process was aimed at soliciting suggestions about a rule that would create a “minimum period” for changing fuel prices. It was not clear whether the regulator had the power to restrict the frequency of fuel price changes by state-controlled oil producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA, known as Petrobras. The company had adopted a policy of nearly daily adjustments under its former chief executive, pricing changes in alignment with international markets. In a statement to Reuters, Petrobras said it would join the discussions by the regulator. The company said “price formation based on market prices and more predictability” may increase competition. Suggestions about a new fuel pricing policy may be sent by consumers, oil companies and state entities, ANP said. President Michel Temer ended the trucker protest by agreeing to cut diesel prices and change the frequency of price adjustments, wiping out a third of the market cap of Petrobras over fears of growing political interference. Public anger has also been building over gasoline prices, which have also recently risen and were not addressed by the agreement with the truckers.
