2018-06-29,"(Adds comment from Biosev chairman, context) By Marcelo Teixeira SAO PAULO, June 29 (Reuters) - Biosev SA, the Brazilian sugar and ethanol producer controlled by commodities trader Louis Dreyfus, said on Friday  that Juan José Blanchard will replace Rui Chammas as its chief executive, according to a securities filing. Blanchard has worked for Dreyfus since 1997, in several positions, including global head of oilseeds and director for fertilizers. “He delivered relevant and positive results in complex markets and diverse economical cycles, and we are confident that his experience will be central in the new position,” Patrick Treuer, Biosev’s chairman, said in a statement. Dreyfus’ sugar unit in Brazil has been a money-losing operation in recent years. The company posted a net loss of 1.27 billion reais ($327.62 million) in the 2017/18 crop season, after losing 600 million reais in the year before. Biosev reached a deal with banks in March to extend maturities on 3.7 billion reais in debt. As part of the financing restructuring, Dreyfus injected $1 billion into the company by buying shares and increasing its controlling stake to 94 percent. The heavy debt load, a large part of which is dollar-denominated, has hurt the company’s results. But the operation reported its largest ever annual cane crush last season, at 32.7 million tonnes, making it the largest cane processor in the world behind Brazil’s Raízen, a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Cosan SA Industria e Comercio. $1 = 3.8765 reais

2018-06-29,"TORONTO, June 29 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index notched its biggest quarterly gain in more than four years and could gain more this year as higher oil prices boost energy shares and legalization of pot leads to deal making among cannabis companies, investors said. In the second quarter, the TSX was led by a 16 percent jump for the energy sector, which accounts for about one-fifth of the weight of the index. Smaller, growth-orientated sectors, such as technology and healthcare also contributed, with the latter boosted by the strong performance of cannabis stocks. Steve Belisle, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management, expects energy stocks to benefit from higher oil prices that boost cash flows and from improved prospects for Canada getting its oil to market. His holdings include shares of Canadian Natural Resources Ltd and Suncor Energy Inc . The price of U.S. oil has rallied to a 3-1/2-year high above $74 a barrel, helping drive a 5.9 percent rise in Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index in the second quarter, its biggest advance since the final quarter of 2013. The S&P 500 index gained 2.9 percent. One of Belisle’s biggest positions is in technology services company CGI. “I would call it a defensive growth company, which is exactly what you want at this stage of the cycle,” Belisle said. While the technology sector rose an impressive 10 percent in the second quarter, it was outdone by healthcare, which climbed 16 percent, led by cannabis stocks. Canada’s government plans to legalize recreational marijuana in October. “As we get close to the launch I think you are going to see a lot of M&A and joint ventures coming into the space,” said Greg Taylor, portfolio manager at Purpose Investments. “You are going to get hints of companies that are going to be able to meet some of their targets and those that are going to fail.” Stocks he owns include CannTrust Holdings Inc and OrganiGram Holdings Inc. At HollisWealth Inc, portfolio manager Elvis Picardo likes Canadian insurance companies, such as Manulife Financial Corp which has lost ground since the start of the year but could benefit from a rising interest rate environment. Higher bond yields reduce the value of insurance companies’ liabilities. Picardo still expects another leg to the global stock market rally. “If the global economy continues to hold up and pick up a little bit of momentum in the next year or so, then we think the TSX could participate,” Picardo said.

2018-06-29,"SAO PAULO, June 29 (Reuters) - Brazil’s state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro may extend the deadline for potential bidders for a 60 percent stake in four refineries to sign non-disclosure agreements, a person with knowledge of the matter said. A ruling from Supreme Court Justice Ricardo Lewandowski this week requiring Congress to approve all sales programs of state-controlled companies threw up another roadblock to the effort to sell the refineries, which had attracted only lackluster interest from potential buyers. Petrobras did not respond to requests for comment. The deadline for potential buyers to sign nondisclosure agreements for the refinery partnerships - a first step in the sale process that does not signal firm interest - had been set for next Monday, July 2, but the person said it may be extended. In a securities filing released on June 18, Petrobras said that five companies had signed nondisclosure agreements, a step that allows them to access more detailed information about the refineries. Reuters reported last month that Petrobras’ decision to cut diesel prices in response to a truckers’ protest was spooking potential refinery buyers. Brazilian conglomerate Ultrapar Participações SA, Cosan SA Industria e Comercio and Cepsa SA, an energy company controlled by sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Development Co, are among the five companies that signed non disclosure agreements, one source with knowledge of the matter said. Another source said Petrobras hopes to get more potential bidders to sign non-disclosure agreements before proceeding to the next phase of the refineries sale. Despite the Lewandowski decision, which has cast a pall over efforts to sell Brazilian state assets in general, a third source within the oil company said it still intends to sell the refineries and is working to conclude the process, as approved by the board. The refineries are expected to be sold in two regional blocks: one in Brazil’s northeast and another in the southern region of the country. Each refinery cluster Petrobras put up for sale has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), a common gauge of operating profits, of $1 billion, according to a fourth person with knowledge of the process.

2018-06-29,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stocks edged up slightly on Friday with Wall Street and European indexes rallying through the day, but overall major markets ended lower for the third straight week as U.S. trade policy took its toll on investor and business confidence. In the U.S., Nike shares ended the day up 11.1 percent to $79.68, the biggest one-day gain in nearly four years for the sportswear maker, after a strong earnings report. Nike was the biggest boost to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the benchmark S&P 500 index. [L1N1TV1VT] The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 59.29 points, or 0.24 percent, to 24,275.34, the S&P 500 gained 2.32 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,718.63 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.62 points, or 0.09 percent, to 7,510.30. MSCI’s gauge of stocks in major world markets  gained 0.66 percent on Friday but ended down 1.26 percent for the week and 0.7 percent for June.  Canada struck back at the Trump administration over U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs on Friday, vowing to impose punitive measures on C$16.6 billion ($12.63 billion) worth of American goods until Washington relents. The retaliation came as General Motors Co warned any U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles could cost jobs and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin denied a report that President Donald Trump wanted to withdraw from the World Trade Organization.  “The markets are very much subject to headlines on trade and tariffs,” said Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. “They are important from the standpoint that trade globalisation has been the cornerstone for growth and when you do something to sort of undermine that cornerstone, that’s a reasonable reason for concern.” The U.S. administration is due to impose tariffs on Chinese goods worth $34 billion beginning July 6, likely prompting a tit-for-tat response from Beijing. In Europe a deal struck by EU leaders on immigration helped sentiment and triggered a jump in the euro. The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.8 percent at its close, while Germany’s trade-sensitive DAX jumped 1.1 percent. While Asian stocks also rose, the Chinese yuan suffered its worst month on record, losing 3.0 percent against the U.S. dollar in June as investors pulled money from a market likely to suffer from higher barriers to trade.   The U.S. dollar slipped to a three-day low against the euro after European Union leaders reached an agreement on migration that eased pressure on German Chancellor Angela Merkel, but the greenback remained on track to log its best quarterly performance in six quarters. The yield curve between two-year and 10-year U.S. notes flattened to 30 basis points, the flattest since 2007, after U.S. consumer spending data disappointed some analysts’ expectations. Some investors see its flattening as a sign recession may be around the corner.  The next major U.S. economic release will be next week’s employment report for June, which will be scoured for any indications of rising wage pressures. Oil prices extended gains to fresh highs on a tighter market as U.S. sanctions against Iran threatened to remove a substantial volume of crude oil from world markets amid rising demand. U.S. crude futures settled up 0.95 percent at $74.15 per barrel. Brent was last at $79.44, up 2.04 percent on the day.

2018-06-29,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Friday, rallying on concerns that U.S. sanctions against Iran would remove a substantial volume of crude oil from world markets at a time of rising global demand. U.S. crude was up more than 8 percent on the week, while Brent crude gained more than 5 percent.  “Now everyone is focused on the issue of spare capacity and the future,” said Tamar Essner, Nasdaq’s lead energy analyst. The market’s attention has shifted to a spate of disruptions after weeks of focus on supply coming online from OPEC and other major producers, she said. U.S. crude rose 70 cents a barrel to settle at $74.15, on track for a weekly rise of 8.2 percent. The session high of $74.43 was the highest since Nov. 26, 2014.    Benchmark Brent crude settled up $1.59 at $79.44 a barrel.  “All the potential shortfalls could outstrip the production increase agreed to by OPEC and Russia,” said Dominick Chirichella, Director of Risk Management at EMI DTN, noting the risk that supplies from Iran could be cut further if other countries follow the U.S. lead and cut imports from that country, the fifth-largest oil producer in the world. Iran pumps about 4.7 million barrels per day (bpd), or almost 5 percent of total output, much of it to China and other energy-hungry nations such as India. The U.S. government hopes other big producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia will boost production to compensate for lost Iranian crude. But unplanned disruptions in Canada, Libya and Venezuela have made the world crude market tight, and many analysts and investors think strict enforcement of U.S. sanctions will push up prices. “Triple-digit oil prices are not off the table,” Vienna-based consultancy JBC Energy said. Showing the shift in sentiment, hedge funds and other money managers raised their bullish bets on U.S. crude in the latest week, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday. A Reuters survey of 35 economists and analysts forecast Brent would average $72.58 a barrel in 2018, 90 cents higher than the $71.68 forecast in last month’s poll and up from the $71.15 average so far this year. In North America, an outage at Canada’s Syncrude has locked in more than 300,000 bpd of production, and operator Suncor Energy said it will probably last at least through July. U.S. oil output has remained near record levels, but the rig count, an indicator of future production, fell by four rigs in the latest week to 858, according to Baker Hughes. U.S. crude production slipped 2,000 bpd to 10.467 million bpd in April from the highest on record in March, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said.  Outside North America, record demand and voluntary supply cuts led by OPEC have pushed up prices. Major buyers of Iranian oil, including Japan, India and South Korea, have indicated they may stop importing Iranian crude if U.S. sanctions are imposed. Until then, they are buying as much Iranian oil as possible. Imports of Iranian crude oil by major buyers in Asia rose in May to the highest in eight months.

U.S. monthly crude oil exports jumped to a record 1.76 million bpd in April compared with 1.67 million bpd in March, according to the data. Weekly U.S. crude exports surged to a high of 3 million bpd last week. Exports of crude oil from the United States have ramped up since Washington lifted a ban late in 2015, with shipments reaching more than 20 countries in April. Production in Texas, the largest producing state in the United States, rose 30,000 bpd to 4.22 million bpd in April, a record high based on the data going back to 2005. Output in Texas has risen every month consecutively for at least one year on a year-over-year basis, the data showed. New Mexico production jumped to 649,000 bpd compared with 624,000 bpd in March. The Permian basin, which stretches across West Texas and eastern New Mexico, is the largest U.S. oilfield. North Dakota oil output rose 61,000 bpd in April to 1.21 million bpd versus March while output in the federal Gulf of Mexico declined 98,000 bpd to 1.58 million bpd. The agency also revised March oil production down by 5,000 bpd to 10.469 million bpd. Crude imports from Iraq surged to 830,000 bpd, the highest since February 2003. The United States also imported 561,000 bpd from Venezuela, where oil output has declined amid political unrest. That was the highest since July 2017. Gasoline demand in April was 9.19 million bpd, down about 0.7 percent, or 61,000 bpd, from a year earlier, according to the report. Gasoline exports also dropped to 886,000 bpd in April, the lowest since October, from 951,000 bpd in March. Demand for distillate fuels, including diesel and heating oil was 4.15 million bpd, up 363,000 bpd from a year earlier. Distillate fuel exports jumped to 1.46 million bpd from 1.15 million bpd in March. U.S. natural gas production in the lower 48 states rose to 89.09 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in April, up from a revised 88.83 bcfd in March, according to the EIA’s 914 production report. Output in Texas, the nation’s largest gas producer, increased 1 percent in April to 22.9 bcfd. In Pennsylvania, the second biggest gas-producing state, production fell slightly to 16.4 bcfd in April, little-changed from March.

Bank shares jumped after U.S. lenders cleared the second part of the Federal Reserve’s stress test, sending the sector 1.2 percent higher after it broke a 13-day losing streak on Thursday, and helping U.S. stocks to recover some losses. Wells Fargo led the gains, surging 4.6 percent, while Citigroup, M&T Bank and a host of other banks were up 1 percent or more. Nike also pushed U.S benchmark indexes higher after the world’s largest sneaker maker surged as much as 12 percent to a record peak on a strong earnings report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 204.63 points, or 0.85 percent, to 24,420.68, the S&P 500 gained 17.48 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,733.79 and the Nasdaq Composite added 41.61 points, or 0.55 percent, to 7,545.29. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.94 percent. A lack of new details about the worsening of the United States’ trade tensions with China and the European Union likely guarded against a global equities selloff on the day, investors said. “It has not been a huge news day in the U.S., probably some of it (market gains) is a snap back based on the recent down markets that we’ve had,” said Curtis Holden, senior investment officer at Tanglewood Total Wealth Management. Earlier, the U.S. stock market briefly dipped on a report by the Axios news website that indicated President Donald Trump was keen for the U.S. to withdraw from the World Trade Organization; the market recovered after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox Business Network the report was wrong. The Axios report cited people involved in talks with Trump. The market’s wobbling was a reminder of heightened investor sensitivity to trade-related remarks or developments. “The markets are very much subject to headlines on trade and tariffs,” said Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. “They are important from the standpoint that trade globalization has been the cornerstone for growth and when you do something to sort of undermine that cornerstone, that’s a reasonable reason for concern.” The U.S. administration is due to impose tariffs on Chinese goods worth $34 billion beginning July 6, likely prompting a tit-for-tat response from Beijing.

2018-06-29,"TORONTO, June 29 (Reuters) - Populist leader Doug Ford was sworn in as Ontario’s new premier on Friday, ending 15 years of Liberal rule in Canada’s most populous province, and he promised to drop a program aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Ford and his Progressive Conservative party swept to power in Ontario’s parliamentary elections earlier this month with a vow to cut personal and corporate taxes. Ford, 53, is the brother of the late mayor of Toronto Rob Ford, who made headlines in 2013 when he admitted to smoking crack cocaine. During his campaign Ford said he wanted to scrap Ontario’s cap-and-trade system designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and repeated the promise at Friday’s ceremony, a policy that is at odds with the Liberal party federal government. Ditching cap-and-trade is expected to ease the burden of businesses in the short-term, analysts have said. In a public open-air event on the front steps of Ontario’s Legislative Assembly, Ford was sworn in as Ontario’s 26th premier. Ford, a businessman with little political experience, also said he would initiate a full audit of government spending. With about a third of Canada’s population of 36 million, Ontario is the country’s economic engine and home to its biggest city, Toronto. It has one of the largest sub-sovereign debts in the world, at nearly C$350 billion ($272 billion) in March. Relatively high power and labor costs have made it difficult for the province to win new investment. “We will protect good jobs in Ontario ... we will protect our agriculture, manufacturing and resource industries,” Ford said in a speech in which he also vowed to “open Ontario for business and “open Ontario for investment and trade.” (Reporting by Danya Hajjaji; editing by Denny Thomas and Grant McCool)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/canada-politics-ontario/canadian-populist-doug-ford-sworn-in-as-ontario-province-premier-idUKL1N1TU26G,29 Jun 2018,"Populist leader Doug Ford was

2018-06-29,"June 29 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies this week cut oil rigs for a second straight week, and notched the first monthly fall since March. Drillers cut four oil rigs in the week to June 29, bringing the total count down to 858, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI That was the first time drillers cut rigs for two weeks in a row since October 2017. For the month, the rig count decreased by one, its first decline since March. For the quarter, however, the count rose by 61, its biggest gain since the second quarter in 2017, after some big increases in April and May. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is much higher than a year ago when 756 rigs were active as energy companies have been ramping up production in tandem with OPEC’s efforts over the past year-and-a-half to cut global output. U.S. crude futures on Friday rose to their highest since November 2014, and were on track for the biggest weekly percentage rise in 11 weeks. So far this year, U.S. oil futures have averaged $65.46 per barrel. That compares with averages of $50.85 in 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading about $71.60 for the balance of 2018 and near $66.13 for calendar 2019 . In anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than 2017, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies they track have provided guidance indicating a 13 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said those E&Ps expect to spend a total of $81.2 billion in 2018, up from an estimated $72.1 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast average total oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,037 in 2018, 1,097 in 2019 and 1,232 in 2020, little changed from last week. So far this year, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,003. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. A total of 1,047 oil and gas rigs are currently in service this week. Most rigs produce both oil and gas.

2018-06-29,"(Adds Enbridge comments on construction, apportionment, activist comment) By Rod Nickel ST. PAUL, Minn., June 29 (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc will not hire private security during construction of its Line 3 oil pipeline as it seeks to avoid the violence that erupted between protesters and security at the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), a senior Enbridge official said on Friday. “No one wants a Dakota Access situation,” said Guy Jarvis, Enbridge’s executive vice-president of liquids pipelines and major projects, in an interview. “We certainly don’t plan to be engaging our own security efforts as a replacement or a supplement to the official law enforcement agencies. That’s different.” The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission on Thursday approved a rebuild of Line 3.. Opponents vowed to stop the project, comparing their efforts to DAPL protests. Protests of DAPL initially were peaceful but tensions rose after protesters were pepper-sprayed and attacked by security dogs. In late 2016, the number of protesters multiplied and they were hit with tear gas and water cannons in freezing weather. Enbridge has a minority stake in Energy Transfer Partners’ DAPL pipeline. “We’re here to make sure that nobody gets hurt,” Jarvis said. “If you employ your own security to do (law enforcement), you’re broadening your responsibilities to an area where we don’t believe we should go.” Enbridge shares rose 7 percent on Friday. Winona LaDuke, executive director of the Honor the Earth activist group, said she is “pretty skeptical” that Enbridge will leave security to police. During DAPL protests, LaDuke said she asked Enbridge to get involved, to no avail. “I asked them to de-escalate that situation,” she said. Jarvis said Enbridge expects to have full authorization to build by November. Construction could start in early 2019. A possible surplus of Canadian pipeline space in a few years, factoring in Line 3, the Ottawa-backed Trans Mountain and TransCanada Corp’s Keystone XL is not a significant risk to Line 3’s business case, although each pipeline company will bear some brunt, Jarvis said. Currently, space is so tight on Enbridge’s Mainline network that it rations space to shippers, called apportionment. Enbridge proposed a modified system in May before withdrawing it over concerns by oil shippers. This time, the company intends to work through a National Energy Board (NEB) regulatory process to find a solution this year, Jarvis said. “There is such a gulf in views that no matter what we do at our own discretion, we’re going to get challenged at the NEB,” he said. “We hope to come up with something that has a degree of support from shippers.” (Reporting by Rod Nickel in St. Paul, Minnesota Editing by Susan Thomas)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/enbridge-inc-pipeline/update-2-enbridge-no-plans-to-use-own-security-during-line-3-construction-idUKL1N1TV16A,29 Jun 2018,"Enbridge Inc

2018-06-29,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has stressed to China the importance of continued enforcement of sanctions on North Korea to press it to give up its nuclear weapons, after warning of signs of backsliding by Beijing.  The State Department said Pompeo had spoken to his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Thursday and discussed efforts “to achieve our shared goal of the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.” Pompeo reiterated that North Korea would have a bright future if it denuclearised and emphasized “the continued importance of full enforcement of all relevant UN Security Council resolutions related to North Korea,” the department said in a statement. It said this was especially important when it came to preventing North Korea’s illegal export of coal and imports of refined petroleum through ship-to-ship transfers prohibited by the United Nations. U.S. President Donald Trump, who held an unprecedented summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 to try to persuade him to give up a nuclear weapons programme that threatens the United States, urged continued sanctions efforts by Beijing last week and said the border between China and North Korea was “getting a little weaker now.” U.S. officials have expressed concern that recent international engagement with Pyongyang could lead countries to relax sanctions pressure. Pompeo told a U.S. Senate hearing this week he had seen “modest” backsliding by China, North Korea’s neighbour and main trading partner, which Trump has courted on the nuclear issue even while threatening a major trade war with Beijing. “We have observed China not enforcing control over their cross-border areas as vigorously as they were six or 12 months ago,” Pompeo said. In April, the U.N. Security Council blacklisted dozens of ships and shipping companies over oil and coal smuggling by North Korea, including five based in China. On Wednesday, Japan’s Kyodo news agency said Tokyo had alerted the U.N. about a suspected ship-to-ship transfer incident on June 21 involving a North Korean tanker in the East China Sea. Pompeo also spoke with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha on Thursday to discuss the next steps on engagement with North Korea, the State Department said. It said they agreed on the need to maintain pressure until North Korea denuclearises. On Thursday, the Financial Times quoted U.S. officials as saying that Pompeo plans to travel to North Korea next week for talks, but the State Department has declined to confirm this. Pompeo said last week he likely would go back to North Korea “before too terribly long” to try to flesh out commitments made at the Trump-Kim meeting. Trump has been criticized by security analysts for agreeing  a joint statement in his summit with Kim that gave no details on how or when North Korea, which has rejected unilateral disarmament, might surrender its nuclear weapons.

2018-06-29,"TUNIS/LONDON (Reuters) - Libyan oil production could face protracted disruption as factions in the east seek to seize control of crude exports, adding pressure to a tight global market. Eastern factions have tried to take over oil exports in the past but have struggled to find buyers because Western nations insist they will deal only with the internationally recognised National Oil Corporation (NOC) based in the Libyan capital of Tripoli. But this has not stopped eastern forces from seeking control of the ports, accusing Libya’s western-based government of failing to share revenues fairly. The latest tussle for power has already cut national production to about 600,000 to 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) after it had been running earlier this year at 1 million bpd — still well below the 1.6 million bpd output before a 2011 uprising plunged Libya into chaos. The damage to Libyan oil production started with the latest series of battles over Ras Lanuf and Es Sider ports, which have been closed for two weeks, causing losses of about 450,000 bpd. On Thursday a parallel NOC in the eastern city of Benghazi started blocking tankers booked by the Tripoli-based NOC from loading at Zueitina and Hariga. The other port under eastern control is Brega. The NOC in Tripoli said on Friday that it expects to declare force majeure at Zueitina and Hariga on July 1, bringing total losses to 800,000 bpd, or $60 million in daily revenue.  NOC Tripoli Chairman Mustafa Sanalla, writing in the Financial Times on Thursday, called the latest crisis “by far the most dangerous” of the challenges facing Libya’s oil industry since the 2011 uprising. Combined exports from the five ports now under eastern control had been about 780,000 bpd in May, analytics firm Vortexa said. “We took delivery of the ports and we have authority over them now,” the head of the parallel NOC in Benghazi, Faraj Said, told Reuters, adding that orders had been issued to prevent the entry of any tanker that was not following its instructions. The oil market — already under pressure from falling Venezuelan and Angolan output, as well as worries about a squeeze on Iranian supplies as U.S. sanctions bite — remains tight even after OPEC and its allies agreed to ease their production curbs. “Any lost barrel from Libya will be very painful,” said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch. “It could not have come at a more inconvenient time.”     The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and its allies agreed last week to return to 100 percent compliance with cuts that have been in place since January 2017, instead of exceeding those curbs. But that brings its own pressure to the market. Output increases will mostly be met by OPEC’s de facto leader Saudi Arabia and Russia, which erodes the buffer of spare capacity that can relieve unexpected supply disruptions.   Libya’s output had tumbled as low as 200,000 bpd in mid-2016 before last year’s recovery to about 1 million bpd. The turnaround was made possible in September 2016 when the Libyan National Army (LNA), led by eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar, took over blockaded oil ports including Ras Lanuf and Es Sider, and allowed NOC in Tripoli to reopen them. But eastern factions reversed that policy in June, accusing the central bank in Tripoli of paying salaries to the LNA’s opponents and giving insufficient funds to the east. Eastern officials have said they would send revenues to a parallel central bank based in the eastern town of Bayda. Yet those revenues may not flow easily. France’s Total, which this year bought a 16.3 percent stake in the Waha Oil Company that exports through Es Sider, said it would only deal with NOC in Tripoli, in line U.N., U.S. and European demands. “Total is bound by international and Libyan laws, including United Nations Security Council resolutions which demand that Libya’s oil facilities and exports remain under the exclusive control of NOC,” it said, referring to the company in Tripoli. The United States, the European Union and individual European states have repeated statements demanding that NOC in Tripoli has sole control, though diplomats said the Western warnings were delayed as efforts were made to reverse the move by eastern forces to put Benghazi’s NOC in charge.

2018-06-29,"(Adds detail, background) TUNIS, June 29 (Reuters) - Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Friday it expects to declare force majeure on loadings from the eastern ports of Zueitina and Hariga from July 1, raising losses in output from a power struggle over oil exports to 800,000 bpd. “This step will have to be taken due to insufficient storage capacity, and because the Libyan National Army (LNA) General Command has prevented legitimate allocations being loaded by blocking vessel entry to ports,” the Tripoli-based NOC said in a statement. The move would cause an additional output cut of 350,000 barrels per day (bpd), increasing total losses from disruption at eastern ports to 800,000 bpd, or $60 million in daily revenue, the NOC said. Earlier this month fighting between the LNA and rival factions shut down the ports of Ras Lanuf and Es Sider, reducing production by around 450,000 bpd. After the LNA regained those two terminals it announced it would hand control of all eastern ports and oilfields to a parallel NOC based in the eastern city of Benghazi, raising the prospect of prolonged disruption to Libya’s national production, which was previously more than one million bpd. NOC Benghazi said it was ordering port workers not to load tankers that it had not authorised, holding up loadings booked by NOC Tripoli at Zueitina and Hariga from Thursday. The NOC in Tripoli, which is internationally recognised under U.N. Security Council resolutions, said blockages at the ports may force the Sarir refinery to cease operations, which would restrict local fuel supplies. It said that eastern-based NOC subsidiaries, Arabian Gulf Oil Company (AGOCO) and Zueitina Oil Co, had taken steps to limit any pipeline damage that could result from limited storage capacity. “NOC calls upon the LNA General Command, alongside whom it has previously worked in the national interest, to end the blockade,” the NOC statement said. “The impact of the on-going standoff to the national deficit is considerable and unsustainable.” Reporting by Aidan Lewis

2018-06-29,"KINSHASA, 29 (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo’s government said on Friday that it has decided to open up parts of Virunga and Salonga National Parks, home to mountain gorillas, bonobos and other rare species, to oil drilling. Earlier proposals to allow oil exploration in the parks met fierce resistance from environmental activists, who say drilling would place wildlife at risk and release huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, causing global warming. The government has defended its right to authorize drilling anywhere in the country and said it is mindful of protecting animals and plants in the two UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The cabinet said in a statement that it had approved the establishment of interministerial commissions charged with preparing plans to declassify sections of the parks, including 1,720 sq km, or 21.5 percent, of eastern Congo’s Virunga. Virunga sits on the forest-cloaked volcanoes of central Africa and is home to over half the global population of mountain gorillas. British company Soco International performed seismic testing there but let its license lapse in 2015. Salonga covers 33,350 sq km of the Congo Basin, the world’s second-largest rainforest, and contains bonobos, forest elephants, dwarf chimpanzees and Congo peacocks.

2018-06-29,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. farmers planted more soybean acres than corn for the first time in 35 years even as domestic soy supplies reached the biggest on record for early June, the U.S. Agriculture Department said on Friday. Growers hoped for better profits for the oilseed, which costs less to plant than corn, but a brewing trade war with China has driven prices sharply lower since the planting season ended. USDA said in its acreage report that farmers planted 89.557 million acres of soybeans and 89.128 million acres of corn. That compares to soybean acreage of 90.142 million and corn acreage of 90.167 million in 2017. Analysts had pegged soybean acreage at 89.691 million and corn acreage at 88.562 million, based on the average of estimates given in a Reuters poll. Corn and soybean futures rallied to session highs after the report was released but quickly pared gains. “You have to ask yourself - with corn being down 47 cents for the month, and beans down $1.50 - do the bears want to push those prices even further down on this news?” said Matt Connelly, grain and energy analyst with Hightower Report. “I don’t think so.”  Corn and soy acreage both rose from the USDA’s planting intentions report, issued at the end of March. Corn acreage came in 1.102 million higher than the March forecast, its biggest positive change between the two reports since 2012. On the stocks front, domestic soybean supplies stood at 1.222 billion bushels as of June 1, topping the record of 1.092 billion set in 2007. Soybean usage was the highest ever for the quarter at 888 million bushels, but stocks remained high due to last year’s bumper harvest. The USDA’s quarterly stocks report also showed the domestic corn stockpile at 5.306 billion bushels, the largest June figure since 5.839 billion bushels in 1988 and the third highest ever. Corn usage rose to a record 3.59 billion bushels during the quarter, up from 3.39 billion bushels a year ago.  Analysts had forecast corn stocks at 5.268 billion bushels and soybean stocks at 1.225 billion bushels, based on the average of estimates. USDA also pegged total wheat acreage at 47.821 million, up from 46.012 million a year earlier. That topped analysts’ estimates which ranged from 46.575 million to 47.700 million acres.

2018-06-29,"LONDON (Reuters) - If last year’s financial markets boom was down to a ‘Goldilocks’ global economy, 2018 has so far been all about the bears, with the worst start to a year for world stocks since 2010. A grizzly mix of U.S.-China trade tensions, central banks turning off the money taps and cooling growth in hotspots including Europe has wiped a trillion dollars off MSCI’s 47-country world index.  A pumped-up dollar .DXY, which has had its best first half in three years, and a 16 percent leap in oil prices LCOc1 have played a big role too clobbering emerging markets particularly hard. Argentina's peso ARS= and Turkey's lira TRY= have been shredded 30 and 17 percent, respectively, Chinese stocks have entered bear market territory and EM equities .MSCIEF have slumped 10 percent, or 17 percent excluding a brief January surge. “People just woke up to the fact that something has changed,” said London & Capital’s Chief Investment Officer Pau Morilla-Giner. As well as the escalation in global trade tensions ""there has been a realisation that the big central banks aren't thinking about stimulating the economy anymore, they are trying to build up capacity in case of recession.""  GRAPHIC - World stocks have worst H1 since 2010: reut.rs/2IyNguk Still, it hasn’t been a doom-fest everywhere. One Wall Street bellwether, the S&P 500 .SPX, is clinging on in positive territory and while the trade jitters have sapped the Dow Jones Industrial .DJI, the Nasdaq .NDX has set records this month. As a set, the FAANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) are up almost 40 percent despite having $400 billion wiped off their combined value in March when it was revealed Facebook misused 50 million of its users’ data. Netflix has more than doubled in price this year, Amazon (AMZN.O) is up 45 percent and Facebook (FB.O) is fully recovered and up over 11 percent. Also, for all the pressure heaped on China in recent months, its tech giant Alibaba (BABA.K) is up 11 percent. Among the major currencies, the dollar is up almost 3 percent against the euro EUR= and nearly 2 percent versus the safe-haven yen JPY= .DXY.  For emerging markets that rise has been a wrecking ball. On top of the ailing lira and peso, Brazil's real is down 14 percent, India's rupee 7 percent, South Africa's rand 10 percent and - despite the oil rally - Russia's rouble 9 percent. GRAPHIC - EM FX H1 performance: reut.rs/2NaEzu7 Having been the stars of 2017, MSCI’s EM equities index .MSCIEF is down 8 percent and local currency and dollar-denominated EM bonds have fallen 6 percent and 5 percent respectively .JPMEGDR. What has caused the most concern though has been China. Stocks there entered a bear market this week having dropped 20 percent from their January peaks, while the yuan CNY=CFXS has just had its worst month on record. With China the biggest consumer of industrial commodities, its misfiring economy has also contributed to the respective 9 and 15 percent declines in the price of copper CMCU3 and zinc CMZN3, used in things like pipes and galvinised steel. “What tends to move markets the most tends to be issues with China,” said Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, Chief Investment Officer for Private Wealth Management at Goldman Sachs, saying it was both her biggest short-term and longer-term worry. “These tensions with the U.S. are not going to disappear, they are just going to ebb and flow,” she said, adding the economy was also imbalanced and had very high debt levels. Another 2017 high-flier, cryptocurrency Bitcoin BTC=BTSP, has lost 60 percent, but even traditional safe havens have failed to provide protection over the last few months. Another two U.S. interest hikes have seen Treasuries US10YT=RR cost holders 3 percent this year and German Bunds DE10YT=RR and gold XAU= are both down 4 percent. Italy’s government bonds meanwhile have plunged 13 percent this quarter as an anti-establishment government took charge in Rome and the European Central Bank confirmed its mass bond buying programme will end this year.

2018-06-29,"(Adds Bank of Canada survey) By David Ljunggren OTTAWA, June 29 (Reuters) - Canada’s economy shrugged off the effects of bad weather to post unexpected growth in April and business optimism rose to near record levels in the second quarter, pushing up the Canadian dollar and boosting odds of an interest rate hike next month. Statistics Canada said on Friday that GDP rose by 0.1 percent from March, the seventh time in the last eight months that the economy has expanded. Analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted no change. A separate report from the Bank of Canada showed widespread optimism among corporate Canada in the second quarter, with companies reporting rising pressure on capacity and prices, along with labor market shortages, because of strong demand. Together, the two reports reinforce market expectations that the central bank will raise rates in July for the fourth time in 12 months. The chance of a rate hike at the July 11 announcement jumped to almost 80 percent from 67 percent, the overnight index swaps market indicated. Stephen Poloz, the central bank’s governor, on Wednesday said economic data would decide the next move. “This certainly doesn’t hurt the case for a hike (in July) with growth beating expectations and with Statistics Canada sounding fairly aggressive that it would have been stronger yet if it were not for adverse weather effects,” said Derek Holt, vice president of capital markets economics at Scotiabank. “I think the bank is going in July,” he said by phone. Colder-than-normal temperatures, including an ice storm across central and eastern Canada, helped cut retail trade by 1.3 percent. Construction declined by 0.5 percent. Manufacturing rose by 0.8 percent from March on higher output of machinery as well as food products and chemical products. The Canadian dollar strengthened to a 10-day high against its U.S. counterpart. Shortly after the data release, it was trading 0.4 percent higher at C$1.3200 to the greenback, or 75.76 U.S. cents. Separately, Statscan said Canadian producer prices rose by 1.0 percent in May from April, the fifth consecutive increase, on higher prices for energy and petroleum products. Of the 21 major commodity groups, prices were up in 17 and down in one, leaving three unchanged. The advance was the greatest since the 1.5 percent jump seen in November 2017.

Bank shares jumped after U.S. lenders cleared the second part of the Federal Reserve’s stress test, pushing the sector 0.88 percent higher after it broke a 13-day losing streak on Thursday, and helping U.S. stocks to recover some losses. Nike also pushed U.S benchmark indexes higher after the world’s largest sneaker maker surged as much as 11.5 percent to a record peak on a strong earnings report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 276.37 points, or 1.14 percent, to 24,492.42, the S&P 500 gained 25.57 points, or 0.94 percent, to 2,741.88 and the Nasdaq Composite added 66.24 points, or 0.88 percent, to 7,569.92. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.20 percent. Earlier, the U.S. stock market briefly dipped on a report by the Axios news website that indicated President Donald Trump was keen for the U.S. to withdraw from the World Trade Organization; the market recovered after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox Business Network the report was wrong. The Axios report cited people involved in talks with Trump. The market’s wobbling was a reminder of heightened investor sensitivity to trade-related remarks or developments. “The markets are very much subject to headlines on trade and tariffs,” said Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. “They are important from the standpoint that trade globalization has been the cornerstone for growth and when you do something to sort of undermine that cornerstone, that’s a reasonable reason for concern.” The U.S. administration is due to impose tariffs on Chinese goods worth $34 billion beginning July 6, likely prompting a tit-for-tat response from Beijing. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 1.13 percent. The euro was set for its strongest day in a month after leaders at an EU summit reached an agreement on migration, rising 0.8 percent to $1.1658. The agreement eased a threat to German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling coalition over the issue. While Asian stocks rose, the Chinese yuan suffered its worst month on record, losing 3 percent against the dollar in June as investors pulled money from a market likely to suffer from higher barriers to trade. The U.S. dollar was set for its strongest quarterly gains since the fourth quarter of 2016, helped by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s move to raise interest rates in June, and expectations of further hikes this year. The dollar index, tracking it against six major currencies, edged down 0.6 percent to 94.787 as the euro rose. The yield curve between two-year and 10-year U.S. notes flattened to 31 basis points, the flattest since 2007, after U.S. consumer spending data disappointed some analysts’ expectations. Some investors see its flattening as a sign recession may be around the corner. Oil prices extended gains to fresh highs on a tighter market as U.S. sanctions against Iran threatened to remove a substantial volume of crude oil from world markets amid rising demand. Brent crude rose 2 percent to $79.51 per barrel, while U.S. crude added 0.6 percent to $73.90, its highest since November 2014. Additional reporting by Helen Reid in London, Amy Caren

2018-06-29,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Executives from natural gas companies call their increasingly cheap and plentiful fuel the world’s best answer to climate change: it produces about half the carbon dioxide of coal when burned in a power plant and it can fuel trucks, trains and ships.  While some outside the industry see natural gas as but a stepping stone to a future when all energy will be provided by wind, solar and other renewable sources, “This idea of natural gas as a transition fuel to renewables is strange,” Total SA chief executive Patrick Pouyanne said. “Natural gas is a solution,” he said this week at the World Gas Conference in Washington, the industry’s biggest global summit.  But environmentalists, regulators, and many in the industry itself warn of a dirty underbelly to natural gas, or methane. Before it is burned, it is one of the most potent greenhouse gases and can reach the atmosphere through leaks in wellheads, compressor stations and chemicals plants. A study published in the scientific journal Nature last week put methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas industry at about 13 million metric tonnes per year, 60 percent higher than the official U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimate. Carbon dioxide emissions from U.S. energy sources, meanwhile, are around 5 billion tonnes. The United States is the world’s top natural gas producer, one of its biggest crude oil producers, and a growing exporter of both thanks to improved drilling technology that has vastly increased output. While methane emissions are relatively small compared to carbon dioxide, they are a major force in short-term global warming. Scientists say methane can trap more than 80 times more heat than carbon in the first 20 years after escaping into the atmosphere. “Man-made methane emissions are responsible for 25 percent of the warming our planet is experiencing right now,” Mark Brownstein of the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) told Reuters. He added that the United States, as a top producer, has a responsibility to properly track emissions and reduce them. President Donald Trump, however, has been seeking to roll back environmental rules to allow companies to rapidly boost output. Last year, his administration halted an Obama-era regulation that would have required drillers on federal land to curb methane leaks, calling it redundant. The administration is “taking the industry backwards, and feeding into the narrative that fossil fuels are bad for the world,” said Fred Krupp, president of the EDF. While some have challenged the methane study’s conclusions, energy executives at the triennial summit said industry should instead review them and learn. “I do believe that we have to acknowledge this is an issue,” said Bernard Looney, chief executive of Upstream with BP Plc. “Gas will not win the argument that it needs to win if we don’t all put methane as an issue on the table.” The stakes are high for the fast-growing industry. Global demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) – a form of the fuel that can be transported globally by ship - has jumped 26.6 percent in the last five years, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  LNG demand is projected to rise another 6.6 percent this year and keep growing thanks to a rapid uptick in imports by China and other nations seeking to offset coal-fired power plants to reduce pollution. “I see that there’s a very important role for gas in cleaning the energy mix,” said Rachel Kyte, chief executive of Sustainable Energy for All.  “But let’s not leave the room with the elephant still here, untouched. You have to plug that methane leak.” The bulk of global methane leakage comes from flaring, where gas produced as a byproduct of crude oil drilling is burned off because there are no pipelines yet available to take it to market. A lot also leaks from old, inefficient facilities that need to be upgraded or replaced. As a result of the leaks, about $2 billion worth of fuel vanishes into the air annually, according to the EDF. Those financial losses are a spur for major oil and gas players to voluntarily take steps to reduce leaks. Greg Guidry, Shell’s EVP of unconventionals, called voluntary action critical because: “If you just wait for regulation, there will be a hell of a lot more methane emitted in the meantime.” Sara Ortwein, president of XTO Energy Inc, a natural gas subsidiary of Exxon Mobil, said work still must be done to make solutions more cost effective, and requirements for leak detection could be a “reasonable part of a sound regulation.” Pratima Rangarajan, chief executive of OGCI Climate Investments, said global standards are needed in the longer term.  “What we need for scale is for everybody to do it because you have to, across the world and in every country,” she said. For Brownstein, of the EDF, the solution is simple. Inexpensive monitoring equipment like infrared cameras and drones can slash methane emissions, along with operation changes. “A lot of this is not rocket science,” he said.

2018-06-29,"ST PETERSBURG, Russia (Reuters) - Russia’s Gazprom (GAZP.MM) expects record high gas sales this year in Europe, Chief Executive Officer Alexei Miller said on Friday, downplaying the threat posed by imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG). Gazprom has managed to gradually increase its market share in Europe, its main market, to around 34 percent despite the general aversion to Russian energy supplies, which became increasingly politicised following Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.  Gazprom’s Chief Executive Officer Alexei Miller said on Friday the Russian gas exports to Turkey and Europe outside of the former Soviet Union may exceed 205 billion cubic metres (bcm) this year, up from 194.4 bcm last year, also a record-high. “There are prospects and the prospects are related to falling domestic gas production in Europe, while demand for gas is rising,” Alexander Medvedev, a deputy of Miller, told an annual general meeting of Gazprom’s shareholders. “Gazprom has all the capacity to supply gas to Europe in the amount Europe needs.” Analysts say sea-borne liquefied natural gas supplies from the United States may undermine Gazprom’s position on the European gas market. The United States exported its first cargo of LNG gas last year. Some European nations, including Lithuania and Poland, started to reduce their dependence on Russian pipeline gas by importing LNG from the United States.  However, Miller said that due to high production and transportation costs, LNG from the United States will not be competitive in Europe. He said U.S. LNG consumption in Europe last year was a mere 2 million tonnes. Miller also said on Friday that Gazprom plans to start supplying Bulgaria, Serbia and Hungary via a new gas link after it finishes the second line of the Turkstream gas pipeline which will run from the Russian Black Sea coast.  Turkstream is a part of Moscow’s efforts to bypass Ukraine as a gas transit route to Europe, which receives around a third of its gas needs from Gazprom.  Gazprom is building the Turkstream in two lines, with capacity of 15.75 billion cubic metres of gas per year each, the first of which will supply Turkey and the second southern Europe.  The second line of the Turkstream will be directed to Bulgaria, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said last month after talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.   “Gas via the Turkstream, at the start of 2020... could run via the gas transmission systems of Bulgaria, Serbia and Hungary... The first and the second lines of Turkstream will be operational by the end of 2019,” Miller said on Friday.

2018-06-29,"* Eastern NOC bidding for authority over five ports * NOC in Tripoli has international recognition * Battle for port control slashed Libyan output * Tankers blocked from loading in two terminals By Aidan Lewis and Ahmad Ghaddar TUNIS/LONDON, June 29 (Reuters) - Libyan oil production could face protracted disruption as factions in the east have sought to seize control of crude exports, adding pressure to a tight global market. Eastern factions have tried to take over oil exports in the past yet struggled to find buyers as Western nations insist they will only deal with the internationally recognised National Oil Corporation (NOC) based in the Libyan capital of Tripoli. But this has not stopped eastern forces from seeking control of the ports, accusing Libya’s western-based government of failing to share revenues fairly. The latest tussle for power has already slashed national production to about 600,000 to 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) after it had been running earlier this year at 1 million bpd — still well below the national output of 1.6 million bpd before a 2011 uprising plunged Libya into chaos. The damage to Libyan output started with the latest series of battles over Ras Lanuf and Es Sider ports, which have been closed for two weeks, causing losses of some 450,000 bpd. On Thursday, a parallel NOC in the eastern city of Benghazi started blocking tankers booked by the Tripoli-based NOC from loading at Zueitina and Hariga. The other port under eastern control is Brega. The head of NOC in Tripoli, Mustafa Sanalla, writing in the Financial Times on Thursday, called the latest crisis “by far the most dangerous” of the challenges facing Libya’s oil industry since the 2011 uprising. Combined exports from the five ports now under eastern control had been about 780,000 bpd in May, analytics firm Vortexa said. “We took delivery of the ports and we have authority over them now,” the head of NOC in Benghazi, Faraj Said, told Reuters, adding that orders had been issued to prevent any tanker entering that was not following its instructions. The oil market, already under pressure from falling Venezuelan and Angolan output, alongside worries about a squeeze on Iranian supplies as U.S. sanctions bite, remains tight even after OPEC and its allies agreed to ease their production curbs. “Any lost barrel from Libya will be very painful,” said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch. “It could not have come at a more inconvenient time, also in the context of the looming decline to zero of Iranian oil shipments,” he said. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and its allies agreed last week to return to 100 percent compliance with cuts that have been in place since January 2017, instead of exceeding those curbs. But this brings its own pressure to the market. Output increases will mostly be met by OPEC’s de facto leader Saudi Arabia and Russia, and that means an erosion of the buffer of spare capacity that can relieve unexpected supply disruptions. Libya’s output had tumbled to as low as 200,000 bpd in mid-2016 before last year’s recovery to about 1 million bpd. The turnaround was made possible in September 2016 when the Libyan National Army (LNA), led by eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar, took over blockaded oil ports including Ras Lanuf and Es Sider, and allowed NOC in Tripoli to reopen them. But eastern factions reversed that policy in June, accusing the central bank in Tripoli of paying salaries to the LNA’s opponents and giving insufficient funds to the east. Eastern officials have said they would send revenues to a parallel central bank based in the eastern town of Bayda. Yet those revenues may not flow easily. France’s Total , which this year bought a 16.3 percent stake in Waha Oil Company that exports through Es Sider, said it would only deal NOC in Tripoli, in line U.N., U.S. and European demands. “Total is bound by international and Libyan laws, including United Nations Security Council resolutions which demand that Libya’s oil facilities and exports remain under the exclusive control of NOC,” it said, referring the company in Tripoli. The United States, the European Union and individual European states have repeated statements demanding that NOC in Tripoli have sole control, although diplomats said the Western warnings were delayed as efforts were made to reverse the move by eastern forces to put Benghazi’s NOC in charge.

2018-06-29,"SOFIA (Reuters) - State-run Bulgarian Energy Holding (BEH) signed a memorandum of understanding with the European Investment Bank on Friday for a preferential loan to finance the construction of a gas pipeline with Greece.     The 182 km (113 mile) gas link, estimated to cost about 212.80 million pounds($279 million), will boost security of supply and reduce Bulgaria’s almost complete dependence on Russian gas. The interconnector link is expected to become operational in 2020 and transport one billion cubic meters of Azeri gas to Bulgaria, as well as some liquefied natural gas from terminals in Greece.  The memorandum concerns securing preferential loan financing in connection with using the state guarantee of Bulgaria for 110 million euros ($128.02 million), said ICGB, the project company for the gas link. BEH holds a 50 percent stake in ICGB, while Greek state energy firm DEPA and Italy’s Edison (EDNn.MI) each hold 25 percent. The European Union has extended a 45 million euro grant for the project and the shareholders will also use their own funds to secure the financing.    ICGB shareholders also signed a number of documents to ensure the construction and operation of the gas link, including an agreement to connect it with the Trans Adriatic Pipeline. Bulgaria has built a gas link with neighbouring Romania and is working to build new pipelines with Turkey and Serbia.  “This is an essential project for bringing additional sources of gas to southeastern European region,” said Miguel Ariel Canete, EU Commissioner for energy, who attended the ceremony in Sofia.

2018-06-29,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe’s trade ties with Washington could do with less drama, the EU’s chief executive said on Friday, ahead of his trip there next month to seek to resolve a spat over U.S. metals tariffs. Jean-Claude Juncker spoke after a summit of EU leaders who showed a united front on challenging the U.S. measures at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), an approach the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is unhappy with. Striking a pessimistic tone ahead of the trip, Juncker said he was not sure he would resolve the issue and chided the Trump administration for seeking to deal with member states on a bilateral basis rather than the bloc as a whole. “I will go to Washington and ... I will present the European point of view. I don’t like this idea ... the American administration (wants) to divide the European Union ... when it comes to trade. This is a competence of the European Union,” Juncker told reporters, referring to the fact that the European Commission handles all the bloc’s trade negotiations. “We should de-dramatise these relations,” he added. “We need these relations. The U.S. needs these relations. I am not sure we will find an agreement between the U.S. and the European Union but we’ll try,” he said.

2018-06-29,"OTTAWA, June 29 (Reuters) - Canada’s economy shrugged off the effects of bad weather to post unexpected growth in April, pushing up the Canadian dollar and boosting the prospects for an interest rate hike next month. Statistics Canada said on Friday that GDP rose by 0.1 percent from March, the seventh time in the last eight months that the economy has expanded. Analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted no change. The Bank of Canada has raised rates three times since July 2017. The chance of an interest rate hike at the July 11 announcement jumped to almost 80 percent from 67 percent, the overnight index swaps market indicated. Stephen Poloz, the central bank’s governor, on Wednesday said economic data would decide the next move. “This certainly doesn’t hurt the case for a hike (in July) with growth beating expectations and with Statistics Canada sounding fairly aggressive that it would have been stronger yet if it were not for adverse weather effects,” said Derek Holt, vice president of capital markets economics at Scotiabank. “I think the bank is going in July,” he said by phone. Colder-than-normal temperatures, including an ice storm across central and eastern Canada, helped cut retail trade by 1.3 percent. Construction declined by 0.5 percent. Manufacturing rose by 0.8 percent from March on higher output of machinery as well as food products and chemical products. The Canadian dollar strengthened to a 10-day high against its U.S. counterpart. Shortly after the data release, it was trading 0.4 percent higher at C$1.3200 to the greenback, or 75.76 U.S. cents. Separately, Statscan said Canadian producer prices rose by 1.0 percent in May from April, the fifth consecutive increase, on higher prices for energy and petroleum products. Of the 21 major commodity groups, prices were up in 17 and down in one, leaving three unchanged. The advance was the greatest since the 1.5 percent jump seen in November 2017.

2018-06-29,"OSLO (Reuters) - A surge in power prices in the Nordic countries will not deter Facebook (FB.O) from looking at building data centres in the region, a company spokeswoman said. Sweden and Norway have traditionally had low electricity prices, making them attractive locations for power-hungry data centres that big digital companies need for their operations. Microsoft (MSFT.O) recently announced plans to build two data centres in Norway and Facebook last month decided to expand its data centre in Sweden’s northern city of Lulea, strengthening its Nordic operations. But power prices in Sweden and Norway are now double those of 2017 as inflows of water to hydropower reservoirs are expected to decline this year. Facebook spokeswoman Camilla Nordsted said: “We take a long-term view towards our investments and the ingredients that make them successful.”  She said the company would not be affected by unusual short-term power price levels in the region, as Facebook had signed a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with three new wind farms in Norway. “The 15-year PPA term provides the long-term financial certainty necessary for the projects to be financed, constructed and operated,” she said. In June, power prices in Norway surged above 45 euros per megawatt hour, double year on year, but the price is only one of the variables Facebook is considering. “Supportive state and local partners, a shovel-ready site, good access to fibre and power, access to renewable energy, a strong pool of talent for construction and operations staff,” are important things to consider, Nordsted said. Facebook is working on evaluating a number of potential new sites for its operations that it aims to power with carbon-free energy, Nordsted said, but she declined to identify specific plans at this stage. Outside the United States, Facebook currently has or has planned data centres in Ireland, Sweden and Denmark, according to data published by the company. Norway and Sweden recently lowered their data centre taxes to attract more investments in the region, which is rich in power from renewable energy sources such as hydropower dams and wind farms.

SandRidge, which said earlier this month it was approached by 17 potential bidders including Icahn, is seeking more bids and has launched a review of its assets and strategies. Icahn, who had then said he was not planning to make a bid soon, was not immediately available for comment. The investor won the battle for control of SandRidge last week, taking five seats on the board. Earlier, the investor had criticized the embattled company’s leadership and forced the removal of its chief executive officer. Of the 26 potential bidders, 10 of them were interested in buying the whole company, while 16 were focused solely on its assets in North Park, an oil and gas basin in Colorado. SandRidge has a market value of about $614 million.

2018-06-29,"ANKARA (Reuters) - The leader of Friday prayers in Tehran called for calm and fortitude after days of protests by the capital’s Grand Bazaar traders fuming over the plunging value of Iran’s currency and rising prices, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. Three days of protests in Tehran and other cities began on Sunday when hundreds of traders in the bazaar - the hub of merchants who backed Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution that ousted the longtime monarch - closed their shops to voice their anger at currency plunges.  Iran’s rial has lost 40 percent of its value since President Donald Trump’s decision on May 8 to pull the United States out of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and reimpose tough economic sanctions on Tehran. “Our enemies want to harm us by creating chaos...Remain calm and resist the economic hardship... We will overcome all difficulties if we remain united and resist the pressure,” Shi’ite cleric Kazem Seddighi told worshippers in Tehran. Thousands of people including merchants took to the streets on Sunday and marched towards the parliament building where they shouted slogans against Iranian authorities. Riot police clashed with protesters and fired tear gas to disperse the crowds.  The protests resembled nationwide demonstrations in January that were originally sparked by economic hardships but turned political. However, the protests earlier this year took place largely in Iran’s provinces rather than in Tehran.  Trump has ramped up pressure on U.S. allies to cut off purchases of Iranian oil, which accounts for 60 percent of the Islamic Republic’s income.  Watching their savings dwindle and shopkeepers hold onto some of their goods, Iranians fear new sanctions will also see sharp rises in the price of food including rice, bread and dairy products.  “Those hoarders are hurting the economy...Bring the goods to your shops from storages,” Seddighi said. Most international sanctions imposed on Iran were lifted in early 2016 under the nuclear deal that saw Iran curbing its disputed nuclear programme under close U.N. monitoring.  The bazaar strike was the biggest sign of domestic disquiet in Iran since Trump ditched the nuclear deal. The pact was the centrepiece of President Hassan Rouhani’s promise to modernise Iran’s economy that won him two landslide elections but has yet to bring widespread tangible benefits for many Iranians.

2018-06-29,"LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - A Pakistani high court on Friday overturned a tribunal decision disqualifying outgoing Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi from running in his home constituency, yet another dramatic twist ahead of general elections due to be held next month. Abbasi is running for election in two constituencies, and the ban had applied to his home constituency in the Murree hill district close to the capital, Islamabad, where he will contest cricketer turned politician Imran Khan.  “We have got the ban suspended from the high court,” Abbasi’s lawyer, Khawaja Tariq Raheem, told Reuters.   Disqualification of candidates is one of the challenges his former ruling party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), has faced ahead of the July 25 elections, which party founder Nawaz Sharif - who was ousted by the Supreme Court last year - has termed a “pre-poll rigging”. The Supreme Court on Thursday disqualified a former privatisation minister for the PML-N, Daniyal Aziz, from running for election for contempt of court over his criticism of Sharif’s removal as political. Sharif has argued that the Pakistani military, aided by top members of the judiciary, backed a series of decisions which banned him from politics for life.  An election commission tribunal had ruled that Abbasi did not declare an accurate value of his assets in his nomination papers. Abbasi denies the charge. “I declared an actual value of my property at the rate which my father bought it in 1974,” he has said. “It is an election for the parliament. They have made it a joke.” He said the nomination papers required a candidate to disclose an actual value of a property instead its present market price.  Abbasi was named prime minister last year after the Supreme Court disqualified then-premier Sharif, who had served twice as prime minister before and was ousted both times. Sharif has a history of differences with the military, which has ruled the nuclear-armed country for almost half of its history. Sharif’s younger brother, Shehbaz Sharif, who took over the party leadership, said on Thursday the recent actions by the anti-graft body put the election process in doubt.  “All political parties must be given a level playing field,” he tweeted.

2018-06-29,"* World stocks rebound on Asia, Europe rally * $1.75 trillion market cap lost since June 12 * Chinese yuan has worst month on record * Dollar set for strongest quarter since 2016 * Euro rises after EU Summit * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Helen Reid LONDON, June 29 (Reuters) - World stocks enjoyed a strong bounce on Friday with European shares recovering from a turbulent week as investors’ fears of higher barriers to trade came closer to becoming reality. MSCI’s index of world stocks rose 0.6 percent by 1212 GMT, its strongest gain in three weeks, but its second quarter was still set to be in the red as investors priced in U.S. tariffs set to be implemented next week. The U.S. administration is due to activate tariffs on Chinese goods worth $34 billion on July 6, likely prompting a tit-for-tat response from Beijing. European stocks rallied strongly, with the pan-European STOXX 600 up 1.1 percent and Germany’s trade-sensitive DAX up 1.4 percent. U.S. stock futures also extended gains, up 0.5 to 0.6 percent and recovering from a brief spike lower after Axios reported that U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly told aides he wants to withdraw from the World Trade Organization. It was the latest sign of investors’ heightened sensitivity to deepening divides over trade. Tariff disputes have already mauled assets from the Chinese yuan to European autos stocks, and wiped $1.75 trillion off the value of world stocks since June 12. Investors pulled nearly $30 billion out of equity funds globally this week, the second-largest ever outflows according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, while U.S. equity funds suffered $24.2 billion of outflows as investors bet U.S.-led protectionism would backfire. The euro was set for its strongest day in a month after leaders at an EU summit reached an agreement on migration, rising 0.8 percent to $1.1658. The agreement eased a threat to German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling coalition over the issue. “The outcome of the summit tells us something about the severity of the situation,” said Jan von Gerich, chief analyst at Nordea in Helsinki. “I’m not confident it will solve the underlying issues but there was a fear that the summit would fail and we could get a collapse of the German government, so that risk premium is being priced out.” While Asian stocks rose, the Chinese yuan suffered its worst month on record, losing 3 percent against the dollar in June as investors pulled money from a market likely to suffer from higher barriers to trade. The yuan traded as low as 6.6441 to the dollar, its lowest since November, as investors speculated China may seek to devalue its currency to compensate for higher tariffs. “We continue to believe that the yuan movements are largely reflecting EM FX movements, and are not a sign of a concerted effort to devalue,” said BBH currency strategists. Despite gains on Friday, the CSI300 and Shanghai Composite are the world’s worst-performing major indexes this year. In stark contrast to the yuan, the U.S. dollar was set for its strongest quarterly gains since Q4 2016, helped by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s move to raise interest rates in June, and expectations of further hikes this year. On the day the dollar index edged down 0.5 percent to 94.924 as the euro rose. European bonds diverged, with the EU Summit migration agreement pushing Germany’s Bund yields up while Italian 10-year government bond yields fell to a one-week low. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury bonds held steady at 2.8455 percent and the yield curve flattened further to 32.17 basis points. Some investors see its flattening as a sign recession may be around the corner. Intensifying trade tariff fears contrasted with a still strong picture of the global economy and robust company earnings growth. “Our view for this year has been that asset markets would likely underperform the real economy as peaking growth momentum, tighter financial conditions, higher inflation and more volatility would act as a drag on valuations even as EPS trends remain solid,” said Morgan Stanley analysts. Despite trade tensions, the STOXX 600 remained on track for its strongest quarter since Q1 2017, and Britain’s FTSE 100 was set for its biggest quarterly gain since 2010. Oil prices extended their gains to fresh highs on a tighter market as U.S. sanctions against Iran threatened to remove a substantial volume of crude oil from world markets amid rising demand. Brent crude rose 1.3 percent to $78.85 per barrel, while U.S. crude held steady at $73.45 a barrel. Emerging stocks jumped 2 percent from a one-month low. The index was still set for its worst month since January 2016 as the rising dollar battered emerging economies, and outflows from EM debt and equity funds accelerated in June to $18 billion.

2018-06-29,"LONDON (Reuters) - European refiners are cutting purchases of Iranian oil faster than expected as the U.S. prepares to reimpose sanctions on Iran, threatening a more severe impact than the last round of punitive measures in 2012 even though the EU has not joined in. Washington said that companies would have to wind down their activities with Iran by November 4 or risk exclusion from the U.S. financial system. Following President Barack Obama’s sanctions in 2012, Europe imposed its own Iran oil ban. This time, however, credit lines are getting cut off despite European leaders vowing to stick to the nuclear deal and European purchases are grinding to a halt. “These sanctions are going to be worse than under Obama. With him, you knew where you stood, how to navigate the sanctions…you never know with Trump. Everyone’s afraid,” one oil industry source said. Swiss lender Banque de Commerce et de Placements (BCP) has told its customers that it would stop financing Iranian oil cargoes by June 30, two sources familiar with the matter said. BCP had said at the end of May that it would suspend new transactions with Iran and wind down activities. A spokesman declined to comment on the June 30 deadline.  Customers of BCP include Greece’s Hellenic Petroleum, Total and Litasco, the Geneva-based trading arm of Russia’s Lukoil, several sources with knowledge of the matter said.  Some are looking for other banking options but the premium on freight rates for Iran, high official selling prices and Trump’s unpredictability have dampened enthusiasm and these refiners are not expecting to load again, sources said.  Litasco had a 300 million euro oil export prefinance deal with Iran but pulled the plug on the revolving credit when the new set of sanctions were announced, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.  Spanish refiners Cepsa and Repsol have been using Madrid-based Ares bank but Cepsa will stop imports from early July, sources familiar with the matter said, as later cargoes had not been agreed prior to the sanctions announcement. Cepsa previously said that it would load crude until November and hoped for a waiver. Europe accounted for about a fifth of Iran's 2.5 million barrels per day of crude exports. Graphic-Iranian crude exports:reut.rs/2Jw4ehD The U.S. has said it wants to deprive Iran of all oil exports, making exemptions unlikely. But Washington subsequently softened its stance, saying that it would work with countries on a case-by-case basis to get as many as possible down to zero by November 4. Key buyer Turkey said it would not cut off trade ties with Iran. Turkey bought around 170,000 bpd of Iranian crude last month, according to port data and ship tracking. The level is in line with the average from January to April, according to official statistics. India, the biggest buyer of Iranian oil after China, continued to buy Iranian oil during the previous round of sanctions but this time it is more concerned about losing access to the U.S. financial system and its oil ministry has asked refiners to prepare for a ‘drastic reduction or zero’ imports. Russian oil major Rosneft [ROSN.MM], is also preparing to halt Iranian oil imports from November after a communication from the Kremlin. The company has already started cutting its oil imports from this month. During the 2012 round, Asian buyers such as China, South Korea and Japan kept purchasing around 1 million bpd - roughly half of Iran’s normal flows.  Senior Trump administration officials have visited European nations this week and will head to the Middle East and Asia later to pressure countries to reduce their oil supplies from Iran.

The Japanese warning, issued in a statement, echoed the warning of two major auto trade groups on Wednesday, which said imposing tariffs would cost hundreds of thousands of auto jobs and dramatically increase car prices. The U.S. administration in May launched an investigation into whether imported vehicles pose a national security threat and President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to quickly impose tariffs. “The trade relationship with Japan, an ally, contributes not only to the economic prosperity of the U.S. but also to its security,” the Japanese government said in a statement, adding that its comments were being submitted to the U.S. Department of Commerce. “The import of automobiles and auto parts from Japan has not by any means been an impediment to the security of the U.S., and will not become one.” Trump has made the tariffs a key part of his economic message and repeatedly lamented the U.S. auto sector trade deficit, particularly with Germany and Japan. Some aides have suggested that the effort is a way to try to pressure Canada and Mexico into making more concessions in talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. A coalition representing major automakers including Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG, BMW AG, and Hyundai Motor Co, said on Wednesday the tariffs would harm automakers and U.S. consumers. Toyota USA added in a separate statement that even a Toyota Camry built in the United States would face $1,800 in increased costs. “Japanese auto-related companies have played a vital role in supporting the growth of the U.S. manufacturing base since starting business in the U.S. in the 1980s,” the Japanese government said. “Any trade restriction measures ... if imposed, could seriously affect more than 1.5 million jobs created by Japanese auto-related companies in the U.S., and, by inflicting costs on the consumers, lead to devastating effects on the U.S. and global economy.” U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said last week U.S. investigation would likely be wrapped up by late July or August.

2018-06-29,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq put to death 12 people convicted of terrorism hours after Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi called for speedy executions in response to the kidnapping and killing of eight members of the security forces, the government said on Friday. Late on Thursday Abadi had ordered “just retribution” through faster executions of al those on death row for terrorism convictions who had exhausted their appeals. “Based on the orders of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, executions were carried out on Thursday of 12 convicted terrorists who have received final verdicts,” a government spokesman said in a statement. Security forces on Wednesday found the bodies of eight men mutilated and rigged with explosives, two days after a deadline set by their Islamic State kidnappers expired. The militants had kidnapped members of Iraq’s security forces and showed six of them in a video posted online on Saturday, threatening to kill them within three days if the government did not release female Sunni prisoners. An interior ministry spokesman said autopsies showed the men were killed before the deadline expired and that the video was Islamic State propaganda. Iraq’s top Shi’ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who rarely comments on political issues, weighed in on the kidnapping which has been a heated topic in Iraq this week and has dominated local media coverage. The country’s leaders should focus on defeating Islamic State and not the results of a May parliamentary election, he said in a Friday prayers sermon delivered by a representative in the Shi’ite holy city of Kerbala, where several of the slain men came from. “It is not correct to get distracted with election results and forming alliances or fighting over positions from doing what is necessary to destroy the terrorists and provide protection for citizens in all areas and provinces,” he said. During campaign season many Iraqis said they view the political class as out of touch and more concerned with power than serving their needs.  At the funeral procession held for the men from Kerbala, mourners hung posters warning politicians not to attend or try to use it for political gain, photos circulated on social media showed. Abadi declared final victory over the hard-line Sunni militants in December, but the group still operates from pockets along the border with Syria and has continued to carry out ambushes, assassinations and bombings across Iraq. Attacks by the group have picked up in recent weeks, especially on a highway connecting the capital, Baghdad, with the country’s north, where the men were taken. The prime minister, seeking a second term as a compromise candidate within a coalition government despite his political bloc coming third in the election, had held a series of meetings with security and intelligence officials ever since the kidnapping video came out.

2018-06-29,"BRUSSELS/PARIS (Reuters) - Europe has pushed back a deadline for companies to volunteer to increase their use of recycled plastics in lieu of regulation, showing how hard it is to end the continent’s reliance on developing countries dealing with its waste. The pledges were due to have been made by the end of June under a European plastics strategy unveiled in January when China stopped taking the world’s waste due to pollution concerns, focusing minds on its environmental impact. An EU official said the deadline had been shifted to September after industry appealed for more time. That timeline makes the fallback option of legislation highly unlikely. The European Union recycles only a quarter of the 25-26 million tonnes of plastics waste it produces per year and about half of that was sent to China, which uses recycled plastics to make products ranging from office furniture to cable coatings. The EU executive wants ten million tonnes of recycled plastics to be used in new products sold in the bloc by 2025 - quadrupling demand. If company pledges do not tally up to that target, it has said it will consider further measures, including regulatory action after December. But few new laws will be put forth next year because of elections for European Parliament and European Commission head - not to mention Britain’s scheduled exit from the bloc. The EU executive’s focus is on pushing through its proposal to ban throwaway plastics such as cotton buds and plastic straws and new labelling rules for plastic waste.  Without a mix of incentives and regulation to spur demand for the waste, industry says there will be no sea change in the market. Recyclers in Europe say they are planning to scale up capacity but that to make it worthwhile, there need to be more buyers for recycled plastic closer to home. In the meantime, they have found markets in other parts of Asia for just over half the waste that used to go to China and say much of the rest is being incinerated, raising the risk of backsliding in sorting efforts, which vary widely across the EU. “If China no longer imports plastic waste, we cannot tell Europeans to stop sorting because we have no more buyers,” said Jean-Marc Boursier, CFO and head of recycling at French group Suez (SEVI.PA). “The right answer is for authorities to change the paradigm and boost the incorporation of secondary materials.” Divisions within the 28-member bloc and warnings from companies that incorporating recycled plastic will lower the quality of products and increase costs, mean enforcing its target is difficult. Some companies have come forward. Among the more ambitious, Volvo, owned by China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co Ltd, has said a quarter of plastics used in its models would be from recycled materials by 2025, while Danone (DANO.PA) said its Evian plastic bottles would be made from 100 percent recycled plastic by then. Austrian plastics maker Borealis, which makes plastics used in products from food packaging to cars, also says it will invest more in coming years to produce “completely waste-based” recycled goods. The Commission official said from all along the plastics value chain had shown interest in the pledging campaign: “We think it is possible to achieve this target on a voluntary basis.” But other EU sources admitted the political push hung on industry goodwill and it will be difficult to even asses whether promises amounted to enough to shift demand.  Borealis CEO Alfred Stern said it was an uphill battle to make recycling profitable. “Technologies need to be developed,” he told Reuters. “But the end goal needs to be commercial, economic viability.” Suez and fellow French water and waste group Veolia (VIE.PA), Europe’s biggest recycling companies, both see an eventual upside to China’s restrictions, with plastics waste a relatively small, but growing part of their business. “The impact of the ban on Europe’s recycling industry is enormous, and while it is a disturbance in the short term, over the long term it is a good business opportunity,” Woldemar d’Ambrières, head of plastics strategy at Veolia, said. Unlike glass, which is cheaper to produce from recycled glass than from silicate, plastics are hard to sort and recycle economically in Europe, especially when oil prices are low. Suez processes some 400,000 tons of plastic waste and produces 150,000 tons of recycled plastic per year. It wants to recycle all the waste it sorts and, if market prices hold up, will invest about 100 million euros over the next three years to boost its recycling capacity to 600,000 tonnes per year. “We want industry to make water bottles from water bottles, milk bottles from milk bottles, shampoo bottles from shampoo bottles,” Boursier said. Veolia recycles about 300,000 tonnes of plastics per year and aims to boost plastics recycling revenue to one billion euros per year by 2025 from 200 million euros today. Industry body Plastics Recyclers Europe (PRE) says many of the smaller companies which handle much of the continent’s plastic waste also have plans to invest and some plastics producers are teaming up with recyclers. In November, Suez and major plastics manufacturer LyondellBasell together bought Dutch plastics recycler QCP, while Borealis bought two German plastics recyclers in 2016. “The plastics industry did not do enough to close the loop,” said PRE director Antonino Furfari. “It realises now that the way to do that is to invest in recyclers.” Additional reporting by Alister Doyle in Oslo and Ludwig Burger in Frankfurt; editing by Philippa Fletcher",https://uk.reuters.com/article/eu-recycling-plastic/exclusive-eu-plea-to-industry-to-reuse-more-plastic-lacks-bite-idUKL8N1TU3CB,29 Jun 2018,* EU plastics waste exports graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2I9C4Zh,EXCLUSIVE-EU plea to industry to reuse more plastic lacks bite
2018-06-29,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Four supertankers chartered by energy major BP (BP.L) have been held up or delayed off China’s east coast over the last two months, unable to fully discharge oil as slowing demand from the country’s private refiners starts to impact global markets.  Two of the four BP-chartered very large crude carriers (VLCCs) are still off Shandong province holding half their cargoes of Angolan crude oil, and another is headed back there from South Korea, according to trade flow data in Thomson Reuters Eikon and two shipping sources who track these vessels.  It’s not clear why the tankers have had so much trouble offloading all their oil, or if BP had first secured buyers for the 8 million barrels - worth more than $600 million at current market prices LCOc1 - that was loaded onto the vessels out of Africa. BP has declined to comment on the matter.  What is apparent is that the fortunes of China’s independent refiners, often called “teapots”, have turned for the worse amid escalating global trade tensions, rising crude oil prices, an oversupplied domestic fuel market and tighter government tax scrutiny.  “Either it’s because of lower run rates curbing teapots’ buying, or the buyers are having problems paying,” said an executive with a western trading house.  While an executive at an independent Shandong refiner said: “The market is bad - weak demand as plants come under policy headwinds ... (with) the tax rules biting into margins.” Both executives declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak publicly about commercial operations. GRAPHIC - China diesel & gasoline exports: reut.rs/2yc8UF2 It is not unusual for producers like BP to ship cargoes before finding a buyer. But having cargoes orphaned for two months is less common, several oil traders and shippers said. Paying for supertankers, each half a kilometre (0.3 miles) long, to wait in open seas to unload is costly as well.  Although it is not known at what rate BP chartered the four vessels, shippers estimate the daily charter rate for a VLCC is now about $30,000 a day. So, four chartered VLCCs sitting idle for a month would cost BP around $3.6 million.  BP declined to comment on the cost of having the tankers waiting off China to unload oil.  Several traders and shippers said BP was unlikely the only seller caught off guard by the slowdown in demand and the teapots’ troubles, although all said stranded cargoes of this size and duration is rare.  Among the four BP-chartered ships, the Texas has been held up the longest. It discharged part of its Angolan crude load in mid-April at Qingdao and was slated to offload the rest of its cargo at Rizhao, another port in Shandong, shortly after.  Instead, the Texas has been anchored off the coast until this week, when it discharged 130,000 tonnes on Thursday, according to a port source with knowledge of the matter.  Another VLCC, the Olympic Light, has been floating near Qingdao after discharging part of its cargo on May 12, and may now be heading to the port to discharge the rest of its crude.  The Mercury Hope, a third VLCC, has been looking for a home for its remaining cargo after it discharged part of it at Qingdao in late May.  A fourth VLCC, Olympic Luck, planned to deliver crude to Qingdao in early May but turned away and transferred half of its cargo this week to a smaller tanker off Nagasaki, Japan, and then sailed towards South Korea.  Now it has turned back and is heading towards Rizhao, still with oil onboard, according to shipping data on Eikon. The ship is scheduled to unload its cargo later on Friday, said Emma Li, an analyst with Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts.

BP, which produces some 2.5 million bpd globally including equity production in Angola, was one of the first western firms to sell into China’s booming independent oil market. It regularly ships West African oil to Shandong, the teapot hub.

2018-06-29,"OSLO (Reuters) - A Norwegian plan to force big power consumers and producers to pay for grid upgrades and extensions could disrupt new projects from wind farms and data centres to ventures in the oil industry, companies told Reuters. Beginning in 2019, Norway’s water resources and energy directorate (NVE) wants firms benefiting from grid additions to pay up to half the investment cost, often a major sum in remote regions seeking to attract industry and jobs. NVE, which by Monday will issue an amended draft of its plan, aims to cut overall costs and distribute them fairly by encouraging big consumers and producers to build their facilities in locations that already have strong grids. Investments of around $17 billion are planned to take place between 2016-2025, the regulator said, and companies consuming or producing power fear they would have to foot a significant part of the bill. “Grid cost is important for future investment opportunities. Seen in connection with proposed higher tariffs for the industry in Norway, total grid cost is becoming a challenge,” said metals firm Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL), the country’s largest power consumer. Hydro argued that the change, if imposed, should be accompanied by cuts in the fees paid to stay connected to the grid, but such a reduction was not part of the plan, NVE section head Torfinn Jonassen said. Power producers Statkraft [STATKF.UL] and Agder Energi [AGDER.UL] said that while the plan may benefit society, it could raise the costs for future renewable energy projects. “This can be a discouraging factor for power production investments located in areas with a weak power grid,” an Agder spokesman said. The projects that are most likely to be affected are wind power plants, he added, but big consumers, such as data centers that Norway aims to attract, will have to reassess where to build their facilities as well. Last week Microsoft (MSFT.O) announced plans to build two new data centres in Norway, in an agreement with the country’s largest firm Equinor (EQNR.OL).  “The regulation will have an effect on where companies will want to build wind farms, data centres or factories and their cost,” said NVE’s Jonassen. Microsoft declined to comment on the regulatory change. Norway’s Oil and Gas Association said the rules could raise the cost of supplying electricity to offshore oil platforms, as well as for grid upgrades planned at onshore facilities, such as the Nyhamna gas processing plant. A transitional regime, taking into account binding commitments made before January 2019, will be included in the plan, NVE said. The regulator has the authority to unilaterally impose the changes.

2018-06-29,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey will not cut off trade ties with Iran at the behest of other countries, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Friday, after the United States told countries to cut all imports of Iranian oil. Washington has told its allies to cut imports of Iranian oil by November, a senior State Department official said this week, as President Donald Trump looks to cut off funding to Iran. Trump in May said his administration was withdrawing from the “defective” 2015 nuclear deal agreed by Iran and six world powers. “If the United States’ decisions are aimed at peace and stability, then we’ll support them, but we don’t have to follow every decision. Being allies doesn’t mean following every decision word for word,” Cavusoglu told broadcaster NTV in an interview. “Iran is a good neighbour and we have economic ties. We are not going to cut off our trade ties with Iran because other countries told us so.”   Turkey, a NATO ally, is dependent on imports for almost all of its energy needs. In the first four months of this year, Turkey bought 3.077 million tonnes of crude oil from Iran, almost 55 percent of its total crude supplies, according to data from the Turkish energy watchdog (EPDK).  President Tayyip Erdogan last year said Turkey was looking to raise the volume of its annual trade with Iran to $30 billion from $10 billion. Cavusoglu also said that there were no problems with the procurement of F-35 warplanes from the United States so far, and he did not think there would be any problems in the future. A U.S. Senate committee passed its version of a $716 billion defence policy bill last month, including a measure to prevent Turkey from purchasing Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jets. The amendment to the bill would remove Turkey from the F-35 programme over its detention of U.S. pastor Andrew Brunson. Brunson, a Christian pastor, faces up to 35 years in prison on terrorism and spying charges, which he denies. Cavusoglu said Turkey had conveyed discomfort about the issue to Trump, who said necessary steps would be taken.

2018-06-29,"(Reuters) - Oil prices look set to stay strong for the rest of this year and in 2019 thanks to supply disruptions and as extra oil from OPEC fails to meet rising demand, a Reuters poll showed on Friday. A survey of 35 economists and analysts forecasts Brent crude LCOc1 will average $72.58 a barrel in 2018, 90 cents higher than the $71.68 forecast in last month’s poll and compared with the $71.15 average so far this year. The monthly survey sees U.S. crude futures CLc1 averaging $66.79 a barrel in 2018, compared with $66.47 forecast last month.  “Supply deficit in the oil market is here to stay,” Frank Schallenberger, head of commodity research at LBBW, said. “I expect OPEC to increase production by some 600,000-800,000 barrels per day till the end of the year. This won’t be enough to compensate for rising demand and declining output in countries like Iran or Venezuela.” Last week, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries led by Saudi Arabia and its allies including Russia agreed to boost oil supplies. The group, which has curbed output since 2017 in an attempt to address a global supply glut, said it would return to 100 percent compliance with previously agreed output cuts, after months of underproduction, partly due to unplanned disruptions. Global oil markets remain tight with unplanned supply stoppages from Libya, Venezuela and more recently, an outage at Canada’s Syncrude upgrader that has especially strained North American markets.  “A number of other geopolitical risks weigh on the global outlook, and these are likely to have a larger impact on prices than in previous years, when oil stocks were comfortable,” said Cailin Birch, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. Also threatening global supplies are the implementation of U.S. sanctions on Iran in November. U.S. trade tensions with China and elsewhere could also have an impact on oil supply. Asian oil demand growth is likely to remain strong, and industry analysts expect it to increase by around 800,000-900,000 bpd over this year and next. “The threat of tariffs on U.S. oil imports (by China) could alter the usual seasonality of oil flows,” said Daniela Corsini, commodity market economist at Intesa Sanpaolo in Milan. A majority of analysts who participated in the poll, however, said they did not expect a significant impact in the short term from the trade dispute between the United States and other major economies including China. “Rising risk aversion could weigh on business sentiment, investment decisions and oil demand ... Import tariffs could also make oil purchases more expensive, leading to higher oil prices,” said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch.

2018-06-29,"BOGOR, Indonesia (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Friday Indonesia should join forces with his country to oppose pressure from Europe on the palm oil industry in the world’s top two producers of the edible oil. Mahathir, speaking during a state visit to Indonesia, said the neighbours faced “similar problems” in the industry. “Our palm oil is threatened by Europe and we need to oppose them together,” Mahathir told a joint news conference with Indonesian President Joko Widodo. The European Union is among the two countries’ largest export markets for palm oil, but it has moved to curb its use to meet climate goals. Palm oil is used in a wide range of products from chocolate to shampoo and the industry has come under scrutiny in recent years as it is often blamed for causing deforestation and forest fires. “European countries used to be covered with forests but they’ve cut them down and nobody argues with them about it. But when we clear land they say it pollutes the climate,” said the 92-year-old premier, who recently came back to power in Malaysia after a shock election victory. Mahathir also said the neighbours had revived plans to jointly develop a car to be sold in Southeast Asia. In Japan earlier this month, Mahathir had said he hoped to begin a new car project to follow Proton, the car company founded during his first premiership stint in 1983. Initially floated years ago, the so-called “ASEAN car” was to be developed by Proton and Indonesia’s PT Adiperkasa but the project was shelved. “In 2015 we could not proceed because of certain reasons but now we plan to continue this project again,” Mahathir said, without elaborating. Proton has struggled in recent years, and last year saw Chinese auto company Geely taking a 49.9 percent stake in the carmaker.

2018-06-29,"* World stocks rebound on Asia, Europe rally * $1.75 trillion market cap lost since June 12 * Chinese yuan has worst month on record * Dollar set for strongest quarter since 2016 * Euro rises after EU Summit * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Helen Reid LONDON, June 29 (Reuters) - World stocks enjoyed a strong bounce on Friday as a recovery in Asian markets spread to European shares after a turbulent week of selling as investors’ fears of higher barriers to trade came closer to becoming reality. MSCI’s index of world stocks rose 0.5 percent by 0800 GMT, its strongest gain in three weeks, but its second quarter was still set to be in the red as investors priced in U.S. tariffs that are set to be implemented next week. The U.S. administration is due to activate tariffs on Chinese goods worth $34 billion on July 6, which is expected to prompt a tit-for-tat response from Beijing. European stocks rallied strongly, with the pan-European STOXX 600 up 1.2 percent and Germany’s trade-sensitive DAX up 1.5 percent. But trade wars have already mauled assets from the Chinese yuan to European autos stocks, and wiped $1.75 trillion off world stocks’ market capitalisation since June 12. The euro jumped after leaders at an EU summit reached an agreement on migration, rising 0.5 percent to $1.1622 at 0800 GMT. “The outcome of the summit tells us something about the severity of the situation,” said Jan von Gerich, chief analyst at Nordea in Helsinki. “I’m not confident it will solve the underlying issues but there was a fear that the summit would fail and we could get a collapse of the German government, so that risk premium is being priced out,” he said. While Asian stocks rose, the Chinese yuan suffered its worst month on record, losing 3 percent against the dollar in June as investors pulled money from a market likely to suffer from higher barriers to trade. The Chinese yuan traded as low as 6.6441 to the dollar on Friday, its lowest since November. It traded at 6.6211 to the dollar around 0800 GMT. Chinese shares rebounded from two-year lows, helped by news that Beijing would ease foreign investment curbs on sectors including banking, automobiles, heavy industry and agriculture. But despite Friday’s gains, the CSI300 and Shanghai Composite are the world’s worst-performing major indexes this year. In strong contrast to the yuan, the U.S. dollar was set for its strongest quarterly gains since Q4 2016, helped by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s move to raise interest rates in June, and expectations of further hikes this year. The dollar index edged down 0.5 percent to 94.924, and was up 0.1 percent against the yen at 110.65. European bonds diverged, with the EU Summit migration agreement pushing Germany’s Bund yields up while Italian 10-year government bond yields fell to a one-week low. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 2.8547 percent and the yield curve widened slightly to 33.3 basis points. Many investors see its flattening to record lows as a sign recession may be around the corner. Intensifying trade tariff fears contrasted with a still strong picture of the global economy and robust company earnings growth. “Our view for this year has been that asset markets would likely underperform the real economy as peaking growth momentum, tighter financial conditions, higher inflation and more volatility would act as a drag on valuations even as EPS trends remain solid,” said Morgan Stanley analysts, cutting their index targets for MSCI Europe on Thursday. Oil prices also came under pressure from trade frictions, falling despite tight crude market conditions that had pushed prices to three-and-a-half-year highs on Thursday. U.S. crude was 0.4 percent lower at $73.19 a barrel. Brent crude rose 0.2 percent to $78.01 per barrel. Gold remained near 6 1/2 month lows, weighed down by trade worries, interest rate expectations and the strong dollar. Spot gold traded up 0.2 percent at $1250.78 per ounce, but was still headed for its worst monthly performance since November 2016. Emerging stocks jumped 1.6 percent, having hit a one-month low in the previous session. The index was set for its worst month since January 2016 as the rising dollar battered emerging economies.

2018-06-29,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China could impose “special emissions restrictions” on industrial firms in as many as 80 cities, extending the program from the current 28, an environment ministry spokesman said on Friday. China said in January that it would force industrial firms in 28 northern Chinese cities to meet tough new emissions curbs in a bid to cut smog in the heavily polluted Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Enterprises in the thermal power, steel, petrochemical, chemical, non-ferrous metals and cement sectors will be forced to comply with as many as 25 new emissions standards by October, with coking coal producers given another year to make the required adjustments. But some have expressed concern that the tougher emissions restrictions would undermine efforts to create a level playing field, raising production costs and making it harder to compete with rivals in other regions. “As China increases curbs on emissions, I believe the measures will be expanded to more regions,” said Tian Weiyong, head of environmental inspections at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.  “But we might start with tighter emission standards in the 80 cities,” he told reporters during a briefing in Beijing. China’s new three-year smog action plan will cover the major coal-producing regions of Shanxi and Shaanxi as well as the major manufacturing regions of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the Yangtze river delta. Inspectors will target small-scale, “scattered” coal users in Shanxi and Shaanxi, two major coal-producing regions, Tian said. China has promised to end a “one size fits all” approach to curbing smog, and will impose production curbs only on firms that fail to meet emission standards. Tian of the environment ministry said China would also begin a round of inspections to ensure natural gas supplies are sufficient in northern China this winter. Regulators are desperate to avoid a repetition of the fuel shortages that hit large parts of the region last winter, as overzealous officials rushed to comply with directives to convert from coal to cleaner-burning gas.

2018-06-29,"SEOUL (Reuters) - The long-planned and much derided Trans-Korea gas pipeline project is back on the agenda, buoyed by hopes North and South Korea can make peace. If realized, it would be a pipeline dream-come-true for South Korea. Lacking its own energy resources or pipelines to regions with gas, South Korea has been shipping the fuel in on tankers as liquefied natural gas (LNG). Based on trade data and average LNG prices in 2017, that cost South Korea around $12 billion in 2017. With LNG prices rising, this year’s tab will likely be even bigger. With relations between North and South warming, albeit from sub-zero levels, the idea of constructing a 1,200 km (740 mile) long pipeline to bring Russian gas through North Korea to the South’s industrial hubs has been revived. The project is now part of South Korea’s New Northern Policy. South Korean President Moon Jae-in and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin last week agreed to strengthen energy cooperation as North Korea’s neighbours push for denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. State-run Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) and Russian state gas company Gazprom will conduct a joint pipeline study, according South Korea’s energy ministry. Despite the renewed enthusiasm, the project remains riddled with risks and challenges. To view Russia to Korea gas pipeline map, click reut.rs/2N6fEYl Estimating pipeline development costs is notoriously difficult, with most projects ending up far above initial estimates. Land pipelines in Europe and North America of similar length have cost between $5-10 billion to develop. Still, piped gas tends to be cheaper than LNG due to the cost of liquefaction by the producer and regasification by the importer. What’s more, relying entirely on LNG imports exposes South Korea’s industry to a volatile market prone to price spikes. Should shipping lanes ever get interrupted, South Korea would even risk running out of gas. Assuming relations with the North normalise and remain good, tapping Russia’s enormous reserves would bring a steady flow of gas to South Korea, improving security of supply and reducing exposure to LNG price shocks. For a graphic on South Korea LNG imports, click reut.rs/2N7Ax5u The pipeline was included in a 2008 memorandum of understanding between KOGAS and Gazprom. The plan was to supply 7.5 million tonnes of Russian gas annually over 30 years from Vladivostok into North Korea and on to the South, starting from 2015. But the agreement fell apart after the death of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and as North Korea advanced it nuclear weapons programme, said Park Sang-chul, professor of energy policy at Korea Polytechnic University. The risk of handing North Korea the power to interrupt supplies to the South were deemed too big. “But as we’re heading in the direction of peace, the likelihood of the gas pipeline has increased,” said Park. Critics, however, also point to disputes between Russia, Ukraine and the European Union over pipeline supplies and fees, which showed Moscow’s willingness to use its gas as a political tool. Beyond political risk, the biggest hurdle is sanctions, which block joint ventures with North Korean firms, prohibit financial transactions with North Korea, and forbid sales and purchases of commodities. U.S. President Donald Trump has said sanctions on North Korea would remain in place until it is nuclear-free. Because of the conflict in Ukraine, there are also U.S. and European sanctions against Russia preventing western firms from participating in Russian oil and gas projects. Should all obstacles be cleared, the pipeline could be completed within three years, according to South Korea’s POSCO Research Institute. To sweeten the deal for North Korea, which suffers from chronic electricity shortages, a gas-fired power station could be built there. “North Korea can also benefit by receiving transit fees or having gas infrastructure,” said Kim Kyong-sool, a senior research fellow at state-funded energy think tank Korea Energy Economics Institute. Based on comparable European pipelines, transit fees for North Korea would be around $100-150 million annually, according to Park.  Despite the project’s improving prospects, critics say it would be safer to import more gas from South Korea’s most powerful ally, the United States. Thanks to a boom in shale gas production, U.S. LNG exports are soaring, including to South Korea. Shipping data shows U.S. LNG supplies to South Korea this year already surpassed those of all 2017, jumping from 2.2 million tonnes in 2017 to 2.6 million tonnes in the first half of 2018.

2018-06-29,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese refiners are ramping up purchases of U.S. crude as it becomes cheaper relative to their usual Middle East supplies and are assessing heavy grades from U.S. shale production as a replacement for supplies from Iran, industry sources said. Increasing purchases by refiners such as JXTG, Japan’s biggest, are likely to please U.S. President Donald Trump, who is pushing Japan to reduce its trade surplus with the United States, which topped $63 billion in 2017. Nearly 4 million barrels of U.S. crude are due to arrive in Japan, the world’s fourth biggest oil importer, between June and September, according to the sources and Thomson Reuters Eikon shipping data.  They will add to about 2.4 million barrels worth 16.81 billion yen ($153 million) imported in the year through May, according to the latest statistics from the country’s Ministry of Finance. Japan’s imports of U.S. oil are still tiny compared with total imports of around 3.2 million barrels a day in 2017. Refiners tend to buy only when lower U.S. demand from events such as refinery maintenance drives down U.S. oil prices CLc1. Japan imported an 18-year high of 10.3 million barrels of U.S. crude in 2017, but imports slowed sharply in the first five months of this year as U.S. spot crude prices were stronger than Middle East benchmark Dubai. A steep rise in U.S. output has since widened the price gap between the two benchmarks to more than $5 a barrel, making U.S. oil more attractive. At least one Japanese refiner has been assessing U.S. Mars crude as a potential replacement for Iranian crude as the company plans to cut Iran loadings after September as U.S. sanctions are reinstated, said a source with knowledge of the matter. “Because of (sanctions on) Iranian crude, we are looking at U.S. heavy crude” as a substitute, the source said, in particular grades such as Southern Green Canyon and Mars, which are similar to crude from Iran. JXTG Holdings (5020.T) recently bought 2 million barrels of West Texas Intermediate crude for arrival by September, according to three industry sources.  A JXTG spokesman would not comment on individual deals but said: “U.S. crude is one of the candidates for replacing Iran oil.” Cosmo Energy Holdings (5021.T) is also lifting 2 million barrels of U.S. oil between April and July, according to shipping data and a source familiar with the matter. Cosmo declined to comment, but said it buys U.S. crude from time to time. Japan's crude imports from U.S. on the rise: reut.rs/2KpwjV5 Trump in May withdrew the United States from a 2015 agreement that curbed Tehran’s nuclear capabilities and ordered the reimposition of U.S. sanctions against Tehran. On Tuesday, a senior State Department official said the United States wants to stop all exports of Iranian oil from November and is unlikely to offer any exemptions as it did during previous sanctions. Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has also been trying to fend off demands from the U.S. president to sign a bilateral trade agreement by offering to buy more American products.  “Prime Minister Abe will probably try to accommodate President Trump as much as possible on the trade imbalance and buying crude oil is a no-brainer as long as the economics work,” from Tony Nunan, senior oil risk manager at Mitsubishi Corp in Tokyo. “To replace Iranian oil it makes sense to go for a sour grade such as Mars and Green Canyon. The problem is these grades are also needed in the U.S. and it is the very light sweet grades that are in excess,” Nunan said. This meant supplies of the heavier grades would likely only be available when U.S. demand dropped, during refinery maintenance periods for example. Japan ramped up purchases of Iranian crude after the end of sanctions, buying an average 172,216 barrels per day (bpd) in 2017, or around 5 million barrels a month.

2018-06-29,"SHANGHAI, June 29 (Reuters) - Asian share markets rallied from nine-month lows on Friday as Chinese shares rebounded from a sell-off, but the market outlook remains gloomy a week before initial U.S. and Chinese tariffs are set to take effect. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 1.4 percent higher, Japan’s Nikkei stock index was up 0.2 percent, and South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.5 percent. Australian shares ended 0.2 percent lower, and New Zealand shares lost 0.6 percent. European exchanges are set to rise following Asia’s gains. Financial spreadbetters expect London’s FTSE to open 40 points higher, Frankfurt’s DAX to open 88 points up and Paris’ CAC to rise 36 points at the open. “I think there’s quite a lot of fairly erratic behaviour when it comes to the perception of this threat of the trade war,” said Jim McCafferty, Head of Equity Research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura. “Trump has a habit of making pronouncements erratically and markets are reacting quite strongly to that.” After falling to fresh two-year lows on Thursday, shares in China rebounded Friday. While analysts said the jump reflected technical factors, it was helped by news that Beijing would ease foreign investment curbs on sectors including banking, automobiles, heavy industry and agriculture. The country’s central bank also said on Thursday that it would ensure that market liquidity remained “reasonably ample.” The blue-chip CSI300 index gained 2.3 percent, and the Shanghai Composite index was 2 percent higher. Despite the gains on Friday, the CSI300 and Shanghai Composite are the world’s two worst-performing major indexes this year, and are set for their worst monthly performances since January 2016. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index rose 1.5 percent. Despite the bump on Friday, analysts downplayed the impact of China’s relaxing of investment curbs on broader trade issues. “This may not be enough to ease current tensions, with the U.S. calling for much greater market access and fairer competition for foreign enterprises. The list affirms China’s stance that opening up will occur in its own timeframe,” Everbright Sun Hung Kai analysts said in a note. Elsewhere in the region, investors remained focused on concerns over global trade, as the U.S. ambassador to China said Washington was not convinced that China is willing to make fast progress on trade. The U.S. administration is due to activate U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods worth $34 billion on July 6, which is expected to prompt a tit-for-tat response from Beijing. “The trade war issue is coming up to a critical junction because of that impending implementation of those tariffs,” said Shane Oliver, chief economist and head of investment strategy at AMP Capital in Sydney. While the scope of the initial tariffs is limited, “investors just worry that (tariffs are) going to lead to more retaliation and then escalation,” he said. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, fell 0.5 percent to 94.895. The currency has risen in recent weeks, helped by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s move to raise interest rates in June, and expectations of further hikes this year. “The ongoing drip feed of high US interest rates is creating consternation,” said Oliver. “Obviously it’s pushing up the US dollar and putting downward pressure on Asian currencies generally, including the renminbi, and that could well have further to go.” The Chinese yuan traded as low as 6.6441 to the dollar on Friday, its lowest level since November. It traded at 6.6161 to the dollar around 0605 GMT. The dollar was up 0.2 percent against the yen at 110.65 . The euro jumped after EU leaders reached an agreement on migration. The single currency was up 0.6 percent to $1.1640 at 0605 GMT. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 2.8601 percent compared with its U.S. close of 2.847 percent on Thursday. The two-year yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was at 2.5283 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.52 percent. Oil prices also came under pressure from trade frictions, falling despite tight crude market conditions that had pushed prices to three-and-a-half-year highs on Thursday. U.S. crude was 0.3 percent lower at $73.26 a barrel. Brent crude was flat at $77.84 per barrel. Gold remained near six-month lows, weighed down by trade worries, interest rate expectations and the strong dollar.

2018-06-29,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan has protested to China for allowing a gas drilling vessel to operate in disputed waters in the East China Sea, the government said on Friday. Japan and China agreed to jointly develop gas fields in the area in 2008 but talks have since stopped. “It is extremely regrettable that China continues its unilateral development in the sea area in a situation where the maritime boundary between Japan and China has not been fixed in the East China Sea,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference. Suga said Japan would continue to urge China to return to talks. Relations between the two nations have improved in recent years after deteriorating sharply in 2012, when Japan nationalised a cluster of East China Sea islets that China also claims. China’s ties with Japan have also long been poisoned by what Beijing sees as Tokyo’s failure to atone for its occupation of parts of China before and during World War Two.

2018-06-29,"* Quiet trading week amid Washington gas conference * Opening of northern sea route could pressure prices * Warm temperatures in North Asia could stem losses By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, June 29 (Reuters) - Asian spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices fell for a second consecutive week as trading slowed with a number of market participants attending a major trade conference and amid a slow down in buying from China. Spot prices for August LNG-AS delivery in Asia fell to $10.30 per million British thermal units (Btu), down 30 cents from the previous week, four industry sources said. Interest for September cargoes have also started and are at similar levels to August, they added. Trading slowed this week as executives globally gathered in Washington D.C. for the triennial World Gas Conference, the sources said. Improving LNG supply for August versus July and a slowdown in purchases by Chinese traders also contributed to the lower prices this week. An opening in the Northern Sea Route (NSR) to Asia could introduce more Russian supplies to North Asia and in turn pressure prices down, though rapidly declining Asian prices could close the arbitrage flow, trade sources said. The $27 billion Yamal LNG plant developed by Russia’s Novatek and France’s Total has shipped a cargo using the LNG tanker Vladimir Rusanov through the NSR for the first time. The tanker is heading to Jiangsu in China, according to Eikon shiptracking data. Two more cargoes have also been sold into Asia, an industry source said. The passageway is important for Yamal because it cuts shipping times to its main customers in Asia by nearly half - to 15 days - and thus saving time and Suez Canal fees incurred on the westward route. On the demand side, higher than average temperatures are expected in Tokyo, Seoul and Beijing over the next two weeks and could boost also boost demand for LNG in the power sector, two traders said. Chinese buyers have so far bought four cargoes for delivery in August in the spot market, though the purchases were largely done last week, traders said. They also bought cargoes for winter earlier than usual, they added. Several buy tenders are keeping spot prices supported, two trade sources said. Pakistan LNG is seeking five LNG cargoes for delivery in September and October, while Mexico’s CFE and Jordan’s NEPCO are each seeking two cargoes for July to August. On the sell side, Indonesia’s Donggi Senoro LNG has offered a cargo for loading in the second-half of August, the traders said. Malaysia’s Petronas has sold a cargo for Aug. 24 loading at $9.60 per million Btu on a free-on-board basis, one of them said.

International oil markets also remained firm as looming sanctions by Washington against Iran are expected to lead to a sharp drop in supplies from the OPEC-member. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $73.17 a barrel at 0049 GMT, down 28 cents, or 0.4 percent from their last settlement. WTI on Thursday hit its highest since November 2014 at $74.03 per barrel. Brent crude futures were at $77.79 per barrel, down 6 cents. Traders and analysts said Friday’s dip was more a result of profit-taking than any market fundamentals, with WTI still up by more than 18 percent from June lows. Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader said this week’s crude price rises had “exhausted the bulls.” North America’s oil markets have tightened significantly as an outage of Canada’s Syncrude has locked in over 300,000 bpd of production. The outage is expected to last at least through July, according to operator Suncot. Outside North America, oil prices have been rallying for most of 2018 due to record demand and voluntary supply cuts led by the Middle East dominated producer cartel of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Oil demand has been chasing records for most of the year, and OPEC has said it will raise output in order to meet demand and replace crude from unplanned disruptions. Looming U.S. sanctions against OPEC-exporter Iran are also fuelling Brent prices. Unplanned supply disruptions from Libya to Venezuela have helped to further tighten the market.

2018-06-29,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (Reuters) - A Minnesota regulator on Thursday approved a certificate of need for Enbridge Inc to rebuild its Line 3 oil pipeline, angering environmentalists but offering hope to Western Canadian oil producers that have struggled to move crude oil to refiners. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission’s decision clears the final major hurdle, pending possible appeals, in Enbridge’s three-year effort to rebuild its aging, corroded 1,031-mile (1,660-km) pipeline that runs from Alberta in western Canada to Wisconsin. Shares of Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge closed up 3.7 percent in Toronto. The commission also approved a route that closely follows Enbridge’s preference and will take Line 3 over a new corridor for part of its path.  The certificate of need has conditions, including that Enbridge make a financial guarantee to clean up any environmental damage and that it remove at landowners’ request pipeline that is no longer in use. Pipeline bottlenecks have steepened a price discount for Western Canadian heavy crude this year. Refiners in Minnesota and surrounding states say Line 3 is necessary to increase crude supplies. Shouts from Native Americans and environmental activists interrupted the meeting. “Shame on you, you cowards!” one woman shouted before breaking into tears. Environmental groups and some indigenous communities oppose the project over concerns about spills and impact on tribal wild rice harvesting areas.  “What they have done to us today is egregious,” said Winona LaDuke, executive director of Honor the Earth activist group. “They have gotten their Standing Rock. We will do everything that is needed to stop this pipeline.” The Standing Rock tribe led opposition in 2016 to the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, one of the most bitterly contested energy projects in years. It was eventually built. The coalition of Line 3 opponents is likely to formally request that the commission reconsider its approval, said Joe Plumer, lawyer for White Earth Nation. Business and labor groups say the $7 billion project, of which $2.5 billion would be spent in Minnesota, will create jobs and tax revenue. “It’s going to give everybody a real boost,” said Bob Schoneberger, who runs a piping contractor business in Duluth, Minnesota. Enbridge Chief Executive Al Monaco said in a statement that he was pleased with the commission’s decisions, and said the project’s cost was materially unchanged. He said he continues to expect the rebuilt pipeline to begin service in the second half of 2019.  Line 3, which began service in 1968, operates at half its capacity. Its replacement would allow it to return to approved capacity of 760,000 barrels per day. “That pipeline is an accident waiting to happen,” said Commissioner Dan Lipschultz. “It feels like a gun to our head that compels us to approve a new line ... but the gun is real and it’s loaded.” Several commissioners voiced doubts that demand for crude oil and refined products such as gasoline would grow enough to warrant the pipeline. But Enbridge’s rationing of demand from oil shippers for space on Line 3 was more convincing of a need to rebuild, said Chairwoman Nancy Lange.   The rebuilt Line 3 will follow the existing pipeline path partway through Minnesota, before veering south to bypass Leech Lake reserve and avoid a need to shut down the pipeline for up to one year during construction. The path of a short stretch near Fond du Lac reserve will be determined by negotiations between the tribe and Enbridge. Tribes in the area had said Enbridge’s preferred route was the worst of numerous options. Fond du Lac lawyer Seth Bichler told the commission that the tribes preferred a longer route to the south that would avoid more sensitive land. Recognized parties, including Enbridge, environmental and indigenous groups, have 20 days from the time a written order is issued - likely in a couple of weeks - to ask the commission to reconsider. If such an application is denied, a party can then appeal to Minnesota’s appeals court. Line 3 also requires 29 additional permits from local, state and federal levels, Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton said in a statement. “Approvals are by no means assured,” he said.

2018-06-29,"QUITO (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence urged Latin American countries on Thursday to help isolate crisis-stricken Venezuela, an ideological adversary of Washington that is struggling under a severe and prolonged economic crisis. Pence met with Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno as part of a tour of Latin America that has included meetings with Venezuelans who left the socialist country because it is so difficult to obtain food or medicine. “One specific threat to our collective security that is on (our minds) ... is the ongoing collapse of Venezuela into dictatorship, deprivation and despair,” Pence said during a news conference with Moreno.  “We respectfully urge Ecuador and all of our allies across the region to take steps to further isolate the Maduro regime.” Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro slammed Pence in response, accusing him of currying favour with conservative Latino voters in Florida.  “The sick and obsessive Mike Pence is going around Latin America, he’s campaigning,” Maduro said in a televised broadcast. “He has failed on this mini-tour of South America.” On Wednesday, Maduro called Pence a “poisonous viper” and vowed to defeat what he called Washington’s attempts to force him from power. Pence said the United States offered to provide $2 million in assistance to Ecuador to handle the growing influx of migrants from Venezuela, whose numbers are overwhelming social services agencies in countries all over Latin America. Washington has already levied sanctions against Venezuela, including barring American citizens from working with a group of high-ranking Venezuelan officials and blocking U.S. investors from acquiring newly issued bonds.  Moreno stopped short of agreeing to isolate Caracas, instead urging involvement by the secretary-general of the United Nations.  “We believe that the solution for Venezuela can only be provided by Venezuelans,” he said. Moreno said Ecuador had taken in nearly 150,000 Venezuelan citizens and was concerned about the “humanitarian crisis” there.  The United Nations has estimated that close to 1 million Venezuelans left their country from 2015 to 2017, driven by hunger, joblessness and the rising incidence of preventable disease. Maduro has said the country’s situation is the result of an “economic war” being waged against it by opposition politicians with the help of Washington. The OPEC country’s oil production has dropped sharply. State oil company Petróleos de Venezuela S.A.’s (PDVSA) oil exports fell 32 percent in the first half of June compared with May. Moreno also said that Ecuador was seeking to improve relations with the United States, which were tense during the decade-long government of Moreno’s predecessor, Rafael Correa, a socialist ally of Maduro. The two countries agreed to exchange information regarding drug trafficking and international organised crime, cooperation  that Correa halted while in office.

2018-06-29,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s oil ministry has asked refiners to prepare for a ‘drastic reduction or zero’ imports of Iranian oil from November, two industry sources said, the first sign that New Delhi is responding to a push by the United States to cut trade ties with Iran. India has said it does not recognise unilateral restrictions imposed by the United States, and instead follows UN sanctions. But the industry sources said India, the biggest buyer of Iranian oil after China, will be forced to take action to protect its exposure to the U.S. financial system. India’s oil ministry held a meeting with refiners on Thursday, urging them to scout for alternatives to Iranian oil, the sources said.  “(India) has asked refiners to be prepared for any eventuality, since the situation is still evolving. There could be drastic reduction or there could be no import at all,” said one of the sources, who has knowledge of the matter. Indian oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan told reporters in Mumbai that the country would attend to its interests while deciding on oil imports. “We know (that) to have a healthy energy mix, we can get oil from anywhere. The rest depends on geopolitics, and those decisions will be taken based on the situations,” he said. “We will go by our interests. When we decide anything on Iran, we will inform you.” During the previous round of sanctions, India was one of the few countries that continued to buy Iranian oil, although it had to reduce imports as shipping, insurance and banking channels were choked due to the European and U.S. sanctions. The source said this time the situation is different. “You have India, China and Europe on one side, and U.S. on the other... At this moment we really don’t know what to do, but at the same time we have to prepare ourselves to face any eventuality,” said the source. While a State Department official has said that Washington wants Iranian oil buyers to halt imports from November, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has told Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to lessen dependence on Iranian oil. Haley, currently in Delhi, spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo early on Wednesday, before meeting Modi. The U.S. push to curb countries’ imports of Iranian oil comes after President Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers and ordered a reimposition of sanctions on Tehran. Some sanctions take effect after a 90-day “wind-down” period ending on Aug. 6, and the rest, notably in the petroleum sector, following a 180-day “wind-down period” ending on Nov. 4. Under pressure from the U.S. sanctions, Reliance Industries Ltd, the operator of the world’s biggest refining complex, has decided to halt imports. Nayara Energy, an Indian company promoted by Russian oil major Rosneft, is also preparing to halt Iranian oil imports from November after a communication from the government, a second source said. The company has already started cutting its oil imports from this month. Indian Oil Corp, Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd and Nayara Energy, the top three Indian buyers of Iranian oil, did not respond to Reuters’s request for comments.     Removing Iranian oil from the global market by November as called for by the United States is impossible, an Iranian oil official told the semi-official Tasnim news agency on Wednesday. The options to find replacements to Iranian oil have widened after OPEC agreed with Russia and other oil-producing allies last week to raise output from July by about 1 million bpd, with Saudi Arabia pledging a “measurable” supply boost but giving no specific numbers. Saudi Arabia’s plans to pump up to 11 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) in July would mark a new record, an industry source familiar with Saudi oil production plans told Reuters on Tuesday. The second source said there were plenty of options available in the market to replace Iranian oil. “There are companies and traders that are willing to give you a 60 day credit, crude is available in the market,” the source said. To boost its sales to India, Iran recently offered virtually  free shipping and an extended credit period of 60 days. “We can buy Basra Heavy, Saudi or Kuwait oil to replace Iran. Finding replacement barrels is not a problem, but it has to give the best economic value,” a third source in New Delhi said.

2018-06-29,"(Adds quotes, background) By Scott DiSavino June 28 (Reuters) - The co-founder and chairman of Tellurian Inc said on Thursday the U.S. natural gas company expects to make a final investment decision on its proposed Driftwood liquefied natural gas export facility in Louisiana in the first quarter of 2019. Chairman Charif Souki, who spoke to Reuters at the World Gas Conference in Washington, D.C., said the company expects to start producing liquefied natural gas (LNG) at the $30 billion project in early 2023. “We expect to receive our federal permits ... and make a final investment decision in the first quarter of next year,” Souki said, which should allow Tellurian to start producing LNG in early 2023 and complete the project in 2026. Unlike most other proposed U.S. LNG export projects that will liquefy gas for a fee, Tellurian is offering customers the opportunity to meet their gas needs by investing in a full range of services from production to pipelines and liquefaction. Tellurian is offering equity interests in Driftwood Holdings at $1,500 per tonne of LNG delivered at cost - expected to be around $3 per million British thermal units (mmBtu)- which Souki said removes the commodity price risk from the customer’s list of concerns. That compares with an average of $3.25 per mmBtu for gas at the Henry Hub benchmark over the past five years. Tellurian said about 25 prospective customer/partners are looking at the offering. Souki said the company expects to narrow the list and convert letters of intent into firm sales agreements by the end of the year. Current partners include Total SA, General Electric Co and Bechtel, which has a $15.2 billion contract to build the liquefaction facility at the center of the project. Pipelines, reserves and other costs make up the rest of the $30 billion price tag of the project. Driftwood will have capacity to produce 27.6 million tonnes per annum of LNG or about 4 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas. One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. There are two LNG export terminals operating in the United States today, Cheniere Energy Inc’s Sabine Pass in Louisiana and Dominion Energy Inc’s Cove Point in Maryland. There are 20 liquefaction trains under construction at five facilities and more than two dozen LNG projects in various stages of development, like Tellurian’s Driftwood. Based only on the plants under construction, total U.S. LNG export capacity is expected to rise to 3.9 bcfd by the end of 2018, 8.7 bcfd by the end of 2019 and 10.1 bcfd by the end of 2020 from 3.8 bcfd now, which should make the United States the third-biggest LNG exporter by capacity in 2019. At the start of 2016 before Cheniere’s terminal entered service in February of that year, the United States was not exporting any LNG. Souki founded and was the CEO of Cheniere until late in 2015. In 2017, global LNG sales rose 9.9 percent to a record 289.8 million tonnes, according to the International Association of Liquefied Natural Gas Importers. As consumers shift from coal to cleaner burning gas for power generation and other uses, Tellurian has estimated that 127 million tonnes per annum of additional liquefaction construction will be required to meet the world’s demand for LNG in 2025. Tellurian has acquired about 11,620 acres with an estimated 1.4 trillion cubic feet of low-cost resources in the Haynesville shale play, which straddles the Texas-Louisiana border. From there, the company is developing the $1.4-billion Haynesville Global Access pipeline to move up to 2 bcfd of gas to southwest Louisiana near its Driftwood facility. Tellurian is also developing the $2.2 billion Driftwood pipeline to move up to 4 bcfd of gas across southwest Louisiana and a $3.7 billion pipeline to bring up to 2 bcfd of gas in from the Permian formation, the nation’s biggest shale oil basin. Much of the gas in the Permian is currently flared because of a lack of pipeline capacity. Souki said Tellurian was building a pipeline network to get access to the cheapest gas available.

2018-06-29,"* Control of ports handed to Benghazi-based NOC * Ports give authorities in charge control of oil exports * EU says will not allow oil trade outside recognised channels (Adds loading blocked at Hariga) By Ayman al-Warfalli BENGHAZI, Libya, June 28 (Reuters) - Officials at Libya’s Zueitina oil port have not authorised a tanker contracted by Tripoli-based National Oil Corporation (NOC) to berth, while loading was also blocked at Hariga terminal, port and industry sources said on Thursday. Zueitina and Hariga are among the oil ports that the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) said on Monday it would transfer to a parallel NOC, which is based in the eastern city of Benghazi, after fighting this month at the Ras Lanuf and Es Sider terminals. The ports are vital to controlling crude exports, the North African nation’s main source of revenue, although shifting who controls the terminals creates uncertainty for international buyers of oil and may cause a suspension of exports. Operations at Zueitina, Hariga and Brega, which is also under the control of eastern forces, had appeared to be running normally until Thursday. One tanker, the Felicity, finished loading 1 million barrels at Zueitina on Thursday under contract from NOC Tripoli. But a second tanker, Amore Mio II, was waiting in the port area without permission to berth, sources said. A tanker had entered Hariga but had not completed loading because of a lack of authorisation, said an official from the Arabian Gulf Oil Company (AGOCO), which runs the terminal. The official said production at Messla and Sarir fields would have to be reduced if loading remained blocked. The head of the parallel NOC, Faraj Said, told Reuters he had ordered ports to prevent the entry of any tanker not authorised by his office. Combined exports from the five ports, which are now under LNA control, were about 780,000 bpd in May and 500,000-550,000 bpd for June 1-27, according to analytics firm Vortexa. Ras Lanuf and Es Sider have been closed since June 14, when opponents of the LNA attacked the ports before being driven out a week later. The parallel NOC in Benghazi has previously tried and failed to market oil independently of NOC in Tripoli, which is recognised by U.N. Security Council resolutions as the only legitimate producer and seller of Libyan oil. The European Union said on Thursday it would “continue to counter any attempt to trade Libyan oil outside the internationally recognised official channels”. The United States, France, Britain and Italy made a similar statement on Wednesday. Eastern factions say they moved to take control of oil exports because revenues going to the central bank in Tripoli were being used to fund militias that attacked the LNA, and that not enough cash was reaching the east. They have said they will try to sell oil through NOC in Benghazi with proceeds going to a parallel central bank based in the east. The NOC in Tripoli made a new appeal on Thursday for the LNA to hand back operational control of Ras Lanuf and Es Sider. “NOC reminds its stakeholders it has repeatedly called for transparency over the distribution of oil revenues,” it said.
