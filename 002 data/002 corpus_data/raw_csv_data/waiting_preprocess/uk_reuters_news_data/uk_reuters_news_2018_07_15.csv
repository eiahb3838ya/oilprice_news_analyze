2018-07-15,"OSLO, July 16 (Reuters) - A Norwegian union for workers on offshore oil and gas drilling rigs stepped up a six-day strike on Monday that has slightly hit oil output after employers did not respond to demands for higher wages and pension benefits. The union is adding 900 workers to the strike, under a plan announced last week, after failing to win concessions before a midnight (2200 GMT) deadline since almost 700 workers on the rigs went on strike on Tuesday. The expanded strike will not have any immediate extra impact on oil or gas production beyond the closure last week of Shell’s Knarr field, which produces 23,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day.

2018-07-15,"BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Two protesters were killed on Sunday in clashes with Iraqi security forces in the town of Samawa, a police official said, amid growing anger in southern cities over poor public services and widespread corruption. The unrest is piling pressure on Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who hopes to serve a second term once politicians form a new government following a May 12 parliamentary election tainted by allegations of fraud.     “Hundreds of people tried to storm a courthouse. Shots were fired towards us. It was not clear who was shooting. We had no choice but to open fire,” said the police official in Samawa.     Earlier, police in oil hub Basra wounded 48 people when they fired in the air to disperse a crowd of hundreds that tried to storm a government building and demonstrated near an oil field. Some 28 members of the security forces were also wounded, according to Major General Thamir al-Hussaini, commander of the Interior Ministry’s Rapid Response Forces.     In a town near the southern city of Amara, police shot into the air to disperse protesters after demonstrators set fire to the municipality building. Thirteen protesters and seven policemen were wounded in the clashes. Iraq’s top Shi’ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, has expressed solidarity with protesters, saying they faced an “extreme lack of public services”. Sistani, who has millions of followers, rarely intervenes in politics, but has wide sway over public opinion. Internet access in Iraq has been dramatically reduced. Local officials said demonstrations have not affected crude production in Basra, whose shipments account for more than 95 percent of OPEC producer Iraq’s state revenues. Any disruption could severely impact the country’s limping economy and push up global oil prices. Abadi’s Dawa party has dominated Iraqi politics since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. “The Dawa party has been running Iraq for 15 years and its leaders failed to live up to even a single promise they made,” said Ziad Fadhil, 38, who is unemployed, in Basra. He held up a piece of cardboard to shield his head from the scorching sun.  Earlier on Sunday, Jordan’s state airline said it had suspended four weekly flights to Iraq’s holy city of Najaf due to the “security situation at its airport”. Flyudubai followed suit. Air traffic was temporarily suspended on Friday when protesters stormed Najaf’s international airport.  Flights from Iran to Najaf will be diverted to Baghdad, Iranian state television reported.  A political bloc led by populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr unexpectedly won a majority in May’s vote on an anti-corruption platform that had appeal across Iraq’s electorate. Abadi has said his caretaker government will release funds to Basra for water, electricity and health services but major relief is unlikely to come soon for the city once dubbed the “Venice of the Middle East” for its network of canals. Iraq needs to generate billions of dollars to rebuild after its three-year war with Islamic State. Demonstrators demanding jobs and better government services, have cut off access to the southern Umm Qasr commodities port. Saddam Hussein oppressed Iraq’s majority Shi’ites, neglecting their southern heartland, and successive Shi’ite-led governments after him have done little to improve lives there.  “Since the fall of Saddam in 2003 and until now the only real thing Shi’ite politicians have been saying is their lies,” said Usama Abbas, 25, an unemployed college graduate in Basra, where oil money rarely trickles down to the population.  “We still drink filthy water and forgot what air conditioning means during summer.” In addition to local government headquarters, the demonstrators have taken the unusual step of attacking buildings belonging to powerful Shi’ite militias. Abadi, who also serves as commander-in-chief of Iraq’s armed forces, issued a nationwide order on Sunday placing security forces on high alert in the southern provinces, aiming to stem the burgeoning protests.

2018-07-15,"* Norway union, employers have no contacts over weekend * Some 900 workers to join rig strike from Monday * Strike to have no immediate extra impact on oil, gas output OSLO, July 15 (Reuters) - A Norwegian oil and gas rig workers’ union prepared on Sunday to widen from midnight (2200 GMT) a six-day strike that has slightly dented Norway’s oil output, saying employers had not responded to their demand for higher wages and pension benefits. “We will proceed with the escalation tonight,” Safe union spokesman Roy Aleksandersen said of previously announced plans to escalate the strike unless employers made concessions. “We have had no contact with the employers.” The Safe union plans to add 901 more workers to the indefinite strike from midnight. The stoppage will have no immediate extra impact on oil and gas output. Last Tuesday 669 workers on the Norwegian offshore oil and gas rigs went on strike after rejecting a proposed wage deal, closing Shell’s Knarr field, which produces 23,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day. “I do not expect anything new before the escalation tonight ... We do not plan any contacts today,” Norwegian Ship-owners’ Association’s chief negotiator Jakob Korsgaard told Reuters.

2018-07-15,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The world’s biggest oil traders are counting hefty losses after a surprise doubling in the price discount of U.S. light crude to benchmark Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1 in just a month, as surging U.S production upends the market. Trading desks of oil major BP (BP.L) and merchants Vitol [VITOLV.UL], Gunvor [GGL.UL] and Trafigura [TRAFG.UL] have recorded losses in the tens of millions of dollars each as a result of the “whipsaw” move when the spread reached more than $11.50 a barrel in June, insiders familiar with their performance told Reuters. The sources did not give precise figures for the losses, but they said they were enough for Gunvor and BP to fire at least one trader each. The companies declined to comment, and none of them publish details of their individual trading books. It highlights the challenges of trading in WTI futures CLc1, the benchmark for U.S. crude, when U.S. pipeline and storage infrastructure struggles to keep pace with surging shale output, that has lifted the United States above Saudi Arabia to become the world’s second biggest crude producer behind Russia. “As the exporter of U.S. crude, traders are naturally long WTI and hedge their bets by shorting Brent. When the spreads widen so wildly, you lose money,” said a top executive with one of the four trading firms. The discount of WTI to Brent hit $11.57 a barrel on June 6, the widest in more than three years, as U.S. output surged to record highs and surpassed pipeline capacity as traders rushed to export. The discount had been about $5 just a month before. Betting on the price spread, a popular trade in oil markets, is based on predictions of price differences between European and U.S. market fundamentals. For a graphic on WTI to Brent Spread, click reut.rs/2Lf0iQ0 The jump in U.S. output, now almost 11 million barrels per day (bpd) from below 5 million bpd a decade ago, has upended the spread. Until 2010, U.S. crude mostly traded at a premium to Brent. But the growing availability of U.S. crude has meant that it has almost always been at a discount since then. However, it is the big, sudden moves that tend to claim trade casualties, sometimes earning the moniker “widowmaker”.         Since the June spike, the spread has narrowed sharply again. The shrinking discount was helped by a rise in the price of WTI due to an unexpected outage at the Syncrude oil sands site in Canada, which can produce up to 360,000 bpd. Due to the Canadian outage, inventories last week at the Cushing delivery point for U.S. crude futures fell to their lowest since December 2014, U.S. data showed. Volatility in the spread has been just one of several trading hazards that emerged in the first quarter of 2018. Traders have also had to pay heavy premiums to exit U.S. storage leases as the oil price structure flipped to “backwardation”, when near-term prices are higher than those for later delivery, making it unprofitable to store crude. Climbing U.S. output has put strains on the pipeline network, particularly in the Permian basin in Texas which has been the biggest contributor to the production surge. A bottleneck that hit U.S. crude for delivery in Midland, Texas WTC-WTM caught BP off guard and led to losses when the discount to WTI shifted sharply during April to June, according to four market sources and one source close to BP. In late April, the discount was close to $6 a barrel before widening to as much as $13 on May 4. This was followed by a sharp bounce back to around $5 in the second half of May followed by a similar see-saw move in June. Three BP traders took the heat for losses related to the Midland rollercoaster. The source close to BP said one was sacked and two others were reshuffled internally.

South Korea, one of Asia’s major Iranian oil customers, imported 686,849 tonnes of Iranian crude in June, or 167,820 barrels per day (bpd), compared with 1.15 million tonnes in June 2017, customs office data showed on Sunday. That was down 9.5 percent from May. In the first half of this year, South Korea’s intake of Iranian crude slid 33.9 percent compared with the same period last year to 6.13 million tonnes, or 248,367 bpd, according to the data. The drop comes after U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration said it would pull out of an international nuclear deal with Iran and renew tough economic sanctions on Tehran. Seoul has since been in talks to get an exemption from the United States in a bid to avert any adverse impact from halting Iranian oil imports. In August, people familiar with the matter have said, South Korea’s Iranian oil imports could be zero for the first time in six years. South Korea mainly purchases an ultra-light form of crude oil, known as condensate, from Iran, and its data does not give a breakdown by products. In 2012, South Korea managed to get a waiver on the previous round of sanctions by importing limited amounts of Iranian oil during that time. Those sanctions were lifted in 2016. In total, South Korea’s June crude imports were 13.14 million tonnes, or 3.21 million bpd, up 13.2 percent from 11.61 million tonnes in the same month last year. From Saudi Arabia, South Korea’s top crude supplier, crude imports in June rose 26.1 percent to 4.38 million tonnes, or 1.07 million bpd, from last year. Shipments from Mexico showed a nearly fivefold increase to 568,377 tonnes. South Korea’s crude imports in the first six months of this year were 74.11 million tonnes, or 3 million bpd, up 2.7 percent from 72.17 million tonnes during the same period in 2017, according to the data. The country’s final June crude imports numbers are due to be released by state-run Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC) later this month.
