2018-06-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The main buyer of electricity from an Arizona coal plant on the verge of closure said on Friday it will instead source its electricity largely from a solar power project, ignoring an appeal by the U.S. Interior Department to buy more power from the plant to keep it open. The Trump administration has been waging a broad effort to keep aging coal and nuclear plants from retirement, arguing that their closure would constitute a threat to national energy security. On Friday, the board of the Central Arizona Project (CAP), a major electricity consumer that supplies water to a large swath of Arizona, voted to sign a 20-year agreement to buy power from a solar project and also agreed to a five-year power deal with utility Salt River Project for electricity from a variety of sources. The vote came despite a plea from the head of Interior’s Bureau of Reclamation, who last Friday wrote to board members to say that a 1968 law gives Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke power to require the CAP to buy energy from the Navajo Generating Station, or NGS, a 2,250-MW coal-fired power plant that is scheduled to close in 2019. “With the 1968 Act in mind, the Department expects to consider several options going forward, including the feasibility of continued use of NGS-provided power,” the letter from Assistant Secretary for Water and Science Timothy Petty said. Such a move would have delayed the plant’s closure.  But CAP officials disputed the assertion that they were required to buy power from the Navajo coal plant, which is closing due to competition from cheaper natural gas and renewable energy. “CAP is not required by law to buy NGS power. CAP seeks a long-term, cost-effective, reliable and diverse power portfolio for the benefit of its water users,” Lisa Atkins, president of the Central Arizona Water Conservation District, was quoted as saying in the Arizona Republic newspaper. A representative of the water organization was not immediately available for comment. Despite the water project board’s decision, the Interior Department said it will continue to find ways to keep the Navajo Generation Station open. “The Department of the Interior is committed to seek a post-2019 economically viable operation plan for NGS,” said spokesman Dan DuBray.  “Interior’s activities with myriad NGS stakeholders - including our discussions with the Navajo Nation, the Hopi Tribe, and the multiple tribes which rely on CAP water - are ongoing and productive,” he said.

2018-06-08,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi cleric Moqtada al-Sadr called on Friday for a nationwide disarmament campaign and announced his Baghdad stronghold would be first to disarm just two days after an ammunitions cache exploded there and killed 18 people. Sadr, whose political bloc won Iraq’s parliamentary election in May, called on all armed groups to hand in their weapons to the government and declared Baghdad’s Sadr City district would be a weapons-free area later this month. “Everyone must obey the orders and not stand in the way of this initiative. Everyone should hand over their weapons without any discussion because the blood of Iraqis is more valuable to us than anything else,” he told his supporters in a statement. The move appeared to be aimed at easing tensions between Sadr and the government. At least 18 people were killed and over 90 wounded as a result of the detonation of an ammunitions cache in Sadr City just hours after parliament mandated a nationwide recount of votes for the May election, a measure rejected by Sadr’s bloc. Sadr had urged his followers to remain calm after the explosion and ordered his office to investigate the incident.  Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, whose bloc came in third, said storing ammunition in a residential area was a crime and ordered the Interior Ministry to investigate the incident and take legal action against those who had done so. Some of Sadr’s political opponents had suggested the ammunitions cache belonged to his Saraya al-Salam (Peace Companies) militia. The Interior Ministry released a statement on Friday thanking Sadr for his announcement. Sadr, a nationalist who opposes the involvement of both the United States and Iran, scored a surprise victory in the May 12 vote by promising to fight corruption and improve services. Parliament passed a law on Wednesday ordering a nationwide manual recount of votes in the election, after Abadi cited serious violations. The move could undermine Sadr, who has in the past mobilised tens of thousands of followers to protest against government policies. One of his top aides expressed concerns that some parties were trying to sabotage the cleric’s victory. Sadr has always been seen as a wildcard in Iraq’s turbulent politics, which is often driven by sectarian interests. His militia, previously known as the Mehdi Army, staged two violent uprisings against U.S. occupation forces after the invasion. Iraqi and U.S. officials described him at the time as the biggest security threat in Iraq. He stressed on Friday that the disarmament campaign should be directed at all armed groups and warned that his followers must not be its sole target. “The Sadrist bloc must not be targeted using this initiative or else there will be negative consequences,” Sadr said. “It must also be enacted upon official security forces that use weapons without permission or mercy; these forces are still young and need rehabilitation,” he said, referring to the mostly Iran-backed Shi’ite militias collectively known as Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF).  Iraq’s military and police dislodged Islamic State militants who took over a third of the country with the help of both a U.S.-led coalition and the militias, many of which are linked to political groups. The PMF was later formally integrated into Iraq’s official security structure, and militias officially severed ties with their political wings although informal links remain.

2018-06-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose and Treasury yields slipped on Friday on anxiety about a potential global trade war as the leaders of the Group of Seven countries met in Canada. U.S. stocks ended higher though thanks mostly to gains in health care .SPXHC and consumer staples stocks .SPLRCS.  G7 leaders met in Quebec Friday with the U.S.’s trading partners furious over President Donald Trump’s decision last week to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from allies like Canada, the European Union, and Mexico. With retaliation already being proposed, the risk to business confidence is a worry for investors. “There are so many questions out there,” said Thomas Roth, head of Treasury trading at MUFG Securities America in New York. “There’s nervousness about the G7 summit and Trump’s North Korea meeting.” An unprecedented U.S.-North Korea summit is also scheduled for June 12 in Singapore, with Washington seeking to pressure Pyongyang into abandoning its nuclear weapons programme. Expectations for another interest rate rise in the United States at next Wednesday’s Federal Reserve policy meeting, and the prospect that the European Central Bank will soon signal a winding-down of its massive monetary stimulus could add to market volatility next week, investors said. In late trading, the U.S. dollar rose 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies .DXY to 93.56, but fell 0.7 percent for the week, its steepest weekly fall in 10 weeks. Against the yen, however, the dollar was last down 0.2 percent at 109.45 JPY=. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR was 2.926 percent, down 0.3 basis point from late Thursday.

2018-06-08,"KIRKUK, Iraq (Reuters) - At least one woman was killed and 14 people including women and children were wounded late on Friday when a bomb exploded in the ethnically-mixed Iraqi oil city of Kirkuk, the military said. The improvised explosive device went off near a mosque in a crowded market area in the evening, a peak shopping time in the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. A second explosive device went off near a coffee shop, injuring one man, the military said. A missile was also fired at a school but there were no casualties, a military statement said. Tensions are high in Kirkuk, where the results of a parliamentary election in May are being disputed by the Turkmen and Arab communities after a Kurdish party appeared to have won. In October, Iraqi forces backed by Shi’ite militias dislodged Kurdish Peshmerga fighters who had taken control of Kirkuk city in 2014. The Kurdish Peshmerga move had prevented the city’s capture by Islamic State militants who had overrun Iraqi army positions in northern and western Iraq. The central government recaptured the city and its oilfields along with other areas in northern Iraq claimed by both Baghdad and the Kurds following an offensive launched in retaliation for a Kurdish independence referendum. The return of the Iraqi army to Kirkuk was greeted with relief by the Arab and Turkmen populations there but the city’s Kurds accuse Iraqi government forces and Shi’ite militias of violations. Islamic State militants have also carried out attacks in the city as well as other parts of Iraq in recent weeks and months. Iraq declared victory over Islamic State in December. But security officials have said the hardline militant group is likely to wage an insurgency in Iraq after its self-proclaimed caliphate collapsed and the militants were dislodged from all the territory they held in the country.

2018-06-08,"DUBAI (Reuters) - OPEC is likely to reject a request by Iran to discuss U.S. sanctions against Tehran at this month’s meeting of the oil producer group, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Iran’s OPEC governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili asked the chairman of the OPEC board to include a sanctions debate in the agenda for the June 22 talks, according to a copy of Kazempour’s letter dated June 2 and seen by Reuters. Last month, Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh asked OPEC to support it against new U.S. sanctions and signalled Tehran disagreed with Saudi Arabia’s views on the possible need to increase global oil supplies. “I would like to ... seek OPEC’s support in accordance with Article 2 of the OPEC Statute, which emphasises safeguarding the interests of member countries individually and collectively,” Zanganeh wrote last month in a letter to his United Arab Emirates counterpart, who holds the OPEC presidency in 2018. U.S. President Donald Trump last month pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Iran, announcing the “highest level” of sanctions against the OPEC member. Iran is the third-largest oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries after Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Oil ministers from OPEC will be meeting at the group’s Vienna headquarters to discuss output policy. Kazempour, citing Zanganeh’s letter, asked the board to include in the June talks an agenda item titled “OPEC Ministerial Conference support to the Member Countries that are under illegal, unilateral and extraterritorial sanctions”. The source said that after receiving Kazempour’s request, the UAE’s OPEC governor Ahmed al-Kaabi sought the advice of legal counsel.  The counsel responded negatively to Iran’s plea, the source said, on the grounds that the ministerial agenda could not be amended because it had been finalised. Earlier on Friday, Kazempour said a U.S. request for Saudi Arabia to pump more oil so that it could cover a drop in Iranian exports and ease a rise oil prices was “crazy and astonishing” and said OPEC would not heed the appeal. “Consumers are now acting to use oil as a political weapon, and yet blaming us (of) fixing) (oil) prices? Such an upside down world,” Kazempour told Reuters.

2018-06-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday as concerns about surging U.S. output and falling demand in China weighed on the contract and JP Morgan cut its price forecast. Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled down 86 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $76.46 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 ended 21 cents lower at $65.74 a barrel. For the week, Brent fell 0.5 percent, while U.S. crude slipped  0.3 percent. In the past three weeks, prices have declined from three-year highs as the market has contended with supply concerns. On Friday, oil prices came under pressure after data suggested Chinese demand was waning and concerns lingered about growing U.S. output.  Hedge funds and other money managers cut their bullish bets on U.S. crude futures in the week ended June 5, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said. JP Morgan cut its 2018 crude forecast for WTI by $3 to $62.20 a barrel. The bank said geopolitical tensions and lingering risks of supply disruptions may push prices higher during the second half 2018, it expects prices will head lower late in the year, and remain capped in 2019.  The futures contracts dipped after the forecast was issued, and then pared losses. China’s May crude oil imports eased away from a record high hit the previous month, customs data showed, with state-run refineries entering planned maintenance. May shipments were 39.05 million tonnes, or 9.2 million barrels per day (bpd). That compared with 9.6 million bpd in April. Further weighing on prices has been rising U.S. output C-OUT-T-EIA, which hit another record last week at 10.8 million bpd.  U.S. drillers added one oil rig in the week to June 8, bringing the total count to 862, the highest level since March 2015, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report. RIG-OL-USA-BHI [RIG/U] The surge in U.S. production has pulled down WTI into a discount versus Brent CL-LCO1=R of more than $11 a barrel, its steepest since 2015. Despite Friday’s decline, Brent remains more than 15 percent above its level at the start of the year. U.S. investment bank Jefferies said the crude market is tight and spare capacity could dwindle to 2 percent of demand in the second half of 2018, its lowest level since at least 1984. Markets have been tightened by supply trouble in Venezuela, where state-owned oil company PDVSA is struggling to clear a backlog of about 24 million barrels of crude waiting to be shipped to customers. More generally, Brent has been pushed up by the voluntary production cuts put in place last year, led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia. OPEC and Russia meet on June 22/23 to discuss production policy. On Friday, OPEC’s third-largest producer Iran criticized a U.S. request that Saudi Arabia pump more oil to cover a drop in Iranian exports and predicted that OPEC would not heed the appeal. Headlines on OPEC members’ plans for the meeting later this month will lead to volatile market swings, said Tariq Zahir, managing member of Tyche Capital Advisors in New York. “I think it is going to be very choppy,” he said.

2018-06-08,"KIEV (Reuters) - Oleksandr Danylyuk, sacked this week as Ukraine’s finance minister after a spat with the prime minister, said on Friday the cabinet lacked the will to raise gas prices even to secure more sorely-needed foreign aid. Danylyuk told Reuters that Volodymyr Groysman’s government would have to try to reach a compromise with the International Monetary Fund because Ukraine faced “very serious consequences” if the IMF declined to disburse more aid. Danylyuk’s comments suggest Ukraine’s hopes of clinching more IMF aid soon could be disappointed, even though parliament passed a law on Thursday to create a special court to try graft cases, a milestone set out in the IMF’s aid programme.  The IMF has backed Kiev with a $17.5 billion (13.05 billion pounds) cash-for-reforms deal since Russia’s annexation of Crimea plunged Ukraine into crisis. But Ukrainian foot-dragging on reforms and tackling entrenched corruption has stalled aid payments since last year. Raising gas prices and creating an independent corruption court are red lines for the IMF. “No,” said Danylyuk, when asked whether the cabinet had the will to raise gas prices before elections next year.  “But I did my best actually to try to bring together these two opposite positions,” he said, between Ukraine’s refusal to raise gas tariffs and the IMF’s insistence on a rise as a condition of more funding.  “So compromise needs to be found and that is where the government should work now. It will not be easy but there is no alternative.”  Groysman’s spokesman did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  Earlier on Friday, Groysman told parliament the issue of hiking gas prices was complicated and “very sensitive for Ukrainian citizens” and that the government had not yet found an answer.  Danylyuk said Groysman’s stance “makes finding a compromise more difficult”. Lawmakers passed legislation on Thursday designed to ring-fence court decisions from political pressure or bribery in the ex-Soviet republic, where entrenched corruption remains a deterrent to foreign investors.  Groysman said the law’s passage showed Ukraine’s fight against corruption was intensifying. But the IMF said it would first assess whether the law, which had undergone around 2,000 amendments, was sufficient. “Look, if Ukraine doesn’t get (an) IMF tranche, we will have very serious consequences, political and financial consequences,” Danylyuk said. Not getting more IMF money would result in high inflation and government spending cuts totalling $4 billion, he said, though he played down fears of Ukraine overshooting its budget deficit of 2.5 percent this year.  After Groysman asked parliament to sack him, Danylyuk said he had been asked to back “political corruption”, using state money to fund projects of favoured lawmakers. Asked to elaborate, Danylyuk said state money was given to lawmakers to buy their support in parliament, which was poor practice even if the legislation being voted on benefited the country.  “They fix the votes like this,” he said. “If it’s for good reason, maybe it’s even good, right? But it’s a bit odd, isn’t it? If it’s for bad reason, it’s actually twice as bad,” he said. “It is corrupt thinking.” Additional reporting by Natalia Zinets; Editing by Catherine Evans and Gareth Jones",https://uk.reuters.com/article/ukraine-danylyuk/update-2-ukraines-sacked-finance-minister-says-no-will-in-cabinet-for-gas-price-hike-idUKL5N1TA4M2,08 Jun 2018,"* Danylyuk: state money used to buy parliament support

2018-06-08,"June 8 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies added oil rigs for a third week in a row even though crude prices have declined about 8 percent over the past three weeks. Drillers added one oil rig in the week to June 8, bringing the total count to 862, the highest level since March 2015, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI That was the ninth time drillers added rigs in the past 10 weeks. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is much higher than a year ago when 741 rigs were active as energy companies have been ramping up production in tandem with OPEC’s efforts to cut global output in a bid to take advantage of rising prices. U.S. crude futures were above $65 a barrel on Friday after earlier this week falling to their lowest level since April 10, as U.S. output surges and falling demand in China. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading around $65 for the balance of 2018 and $63 for calendar 2019. In anticipation of higher prices, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies they track have provided guidance indicating a 13 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said those E&Ps expect to spend a total of $81.2 billion in 2018, up from an estimated $72.1 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast average total oil and natural gas rig count would rise to 1,025 in 2018 and 1,125 in 2019, the same as last week. With the boost in rigs so far this year, however, analysts were not so bullish on further increases in the count. Since 1,062 oil and gas rigs were currently in service, drillers would not have to add any more rigs for the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. So far this year, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 996, up sharply from 2017’s average of 876. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected average annual U.S. production will rise to a record high 10.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 and 11.9 million bpd in 2019 from 9.4 million bpd in 2017. The current all-time U.S. annual output peak was in 1970 at 9.6 million bpd, according to federal energy data. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-06-08,"* Stocks edge lower as G7 summit worries weigh * Talk of Fed, ECB tightening adds to risk-off sentiment * Crude oil prices fall (Updates with midday U.S. markets activity, changes byline, dateline, previous LONDON) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - Stocks on global indexes mostly eased while the dollar rose on Friday as expectations that trade tensions will dominate the Group of Seven countries’ summit weighed on sentiment. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.31 percent. It was still on track, however, to break a three-week streak of losses. U.S. stocks were nearly flat. Investors were anxious about the G7 summit, kicking off Friday in Quebec, where mounting risks of a tariff war between the United States and its major trade partners are in the spotlight. The divide has been widening between U.S. President Donald Trump and the group’s remaining six members after Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union last week. “I suspect that expectations from the G7 have been reduced,” said Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank Private Wealth Management. “Expectations have been very modest that there will be much of a productive nature to these meetings.” The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.25 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 24.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 25,266.36, the S&P 500 gained 0.54 point, or 0.02 percent, to 2,770.91 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 6.82 points, or 0.09 percent, to 7,628.25. Expectations of more interest rate hikes in the United States, and the prospect that the European Central Bank will soon signal a winding-down of its massive monetary stimulus also contributed to the risk-off tone, investors said. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise U.S. rates next week, its second increase this year, and some investors think it may hint at four rate hikes in 2018 rather than the three that have been widely anticipated. ECB policymakers meeting on June 14 will debate whether to end bond purchases this year, the bank’s chief economist said this week. His hawkish message sent the euro to a three-week top, hit emerging markets, and spurred demand for safe-haven bonds. An unprecedented U.S.-North Korea summit scheduled for June 12 in Singapore, with Washington seeking to pressure Pyongyang into abandoning its nuclear weapons program, is giving investors another reason for caution. The U.S. dollar rose after a four-day losing streak, while perceived safe-haven currencies such as the yen gained as investors grew cautious. The dollar index rose 0.18 percent, with the euro down 0.24 percent to $1.1769. The Japanese yen, considered a safe haven, strengthened 0.21 percent versus the greenback at 109.47 per dollar. U.S. Treasury yields were little changed as traders awaited outcome of the summit. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 2/32 in price to yield 2.926 percent, from 2.933 percent late on Thursday. In the oil market, U.S. crude fell 0.59 percent to $65.56 per barrel and Brent was last at $76.51, down 1.05 percent. Additional reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Richard

2018-06-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) said production of up to 250,000 cars from its group brands in the second half will be delayed because of effects from new mandatory lab tests for emissions and fuel economy. Implementation of the so-called Worldwide Harmonized Light Duty Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) on Sept. 1 for new cars will temporarily restrict the availability of some models and could affect working capital by driving up first-half inventories, Volkswagen (VW) said on Friday, without being more specific. Carmakers are facing bottlenecks as they rush to get models through the more complex WLTP tests on a limited number of exhaust emissions test benches as they won’t be able to sell new vehicles after Sept. 1 without the new carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and fuel consumption readings. “Because of the introduction of the new WLTP testing procedure, we expect in the second half of 2018 an effect at the VW group of around 200,000 to 250,000 vehicles that we will build later than originally planned,” VW said. Although effects on sales cannot be ruled out from the launch of WLTP which replaces the outdated New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and aims to better reflect real-driving data, VW on Friday reaffirmed its goal for group deliveries to moderately exceed last year’s record 10.7 million units. “We are working at high pressure on further measures to keep the effects on our production as low as possible,” VW said. Porsche, the second-biggest contributor to VW group profit said last week it would temporarily limit the number of models it sells in Europe because of the implications of WLTP. Wolfsburg-based VW had no comment on potential costs from the disruptions. Citing unnamed sources at VW, German magazine Der Spiegel on Friday reported that the risk for VW could run into billions as the bottlenecks mean a mid-level, six-digit number of cars could hit dealerships late or not at all.

2018-06-08,"KIEV, June 8 (Reuters) - Oleksandr Danylyuk, who was sacked as Ukraine’s finance minister this week after a spat with the prime minister, said on Friday the cabinet does not have the will to raise gas prices even to secure more sorely-needed foreign aid. He told Reuters that Volodymyr Groysman’s government would have to try to reach a compromise with the International Monetary Fund, because Ukraine faced “very serious consequences” if the IMF declined to disburse more aid. “No,” said Danylyuk, when asked whether the cabinet had the will to raise gas prices before elections next year. “But I did my best actually to try to bring together these two opposite positions,” he said, between Ukraine’s refusal to raise gas tariffs and the IMF’s insistence on a rise as a condition of more funding. “So compromise needs to be found and that is where the government should work now. It will not be easy but there is no alternative,” the former finance minister said.

2018-06-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - A planned nuclear plant to the east of London will not require state investment, the Chinese company building it said after the British government was criticized for helping another project. “It is not our plan to seek direct investment from the UK government for Bradwell B,” Robert Davies, chief operating officer of CGN UK, a UK subsidiary of China’s General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN), IPO-CGNP.HK told Reuters. After saying it did not want to directly invest in new nuclear plants, Britain’s government made a U-turn this week, saying it could take a stake in Hitachi’s (6501.T) near $20 billion Wlyfa project in Wales, CGN’s Davies said it was too early to discuss funding in detail but, but the fact that the Chinese-owned firm said it will not need such direct investment shows it is confident of funding the project itself, or being able to raise the cash. The British government also faced protests over its decision to offer a guaranteed power price to the Hinkley Point project being built by France’s EDF (EDF.PA), Britain’s first new nuclear plant in more than twenty years.  Britain says it needs a new fleet of nuclear plants to replace aging coal and nuclear reactors set to close in the 2020s as well as to cut the country’s carbon emissions. But large new nuclear power plants costing several billion pounds have struggled to secure financing, with the cost of lending higher than traditional infrastructure projects due to concerns over future potential liabilities.     This raised the possibility that it would also need to provide similar assistance for other new plants to be built. Hinkley got the final go-ahead from EDF’s board in 2016  after several years of delay, and only after securing backing from the French government. When announcing the possible Hitachi deal, Britain’s business minister Greg Clark said it hoped future nuclear projects “should be financed by the private sector.” Hinkley was also awarded a subsidy minimum price guarantee from the British government of almost double current electricity prices, which the National Audit office said could cost consumers 30 billion pounds ($40 billion). Davies said CGN’s Bradwell project would expect a much lower minimum guarantee price. “We know we have to get within a realistic range of (the cost of) offshore wind,” he said. Some offshore wind projects were awarded a minimum price as low as 57.50 per megawatt hour (MWh) in the latest round of subsidies, compared with the 92.50 pounds per MWh guaranteed for Hinkley. CGN owns a third of EDF’s Hinkley project and will also help it develop another new plant in Suffolk, Sizewell C. The Chinese company will also lead construction of the plant in Bradwell, Essex, using a Chinese-designed nuclear reactor which needs to gain approval from Britain’s nuclear regulator. “We expect to complete the second phase of the GDA (generic design approval) by the end of the year and final approval by the end of 2021. The target is for the final investment decision to be made shortly after that,” Davies said.  The HPR 1000 nuclear reactor CGN plans to use at Bradwell is capable of generating 1000 megawatts (MW) but no decision has been made yet about how many reactors would be deployed.

2018-06-08,"DUBAI, June 8 (Reuters) - OPEC is likely to reject a request by Iran to discuss U.S. sanctions against Tehran at this month’s meeting of the oil producer group, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Iran’s OPEC governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili asked the chairman of the OPEC board to include a sanctions debate in the agenda for the June 22 talks, according to a copy of Kazempour’s letter dated June 2 and seen by Reuters. Last month, Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh asked OPEC to support it against new U.S. sanctions and signalled Tehran disagreed with Saudi Arabia’s views on the possible need to increase global oil supplies. “I would like to ... seek OPEC’s support in accordance with Article 2 of the OPEC Statute, which emphasises safeguarding the interests of member countries individually and collectively,” Zanganeh wrote last month in a letter to his United Arab Emirates counterpart, who holds the OPEC presidency in 2018. U.S. President Donald Trump last month pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Iran, announcing the “highest level” of sanctions against the OPEC member. Iran is the third-largest oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries after Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Oil ministers from OPEC will be meeting at the group’s Vienna headquarters to discuss output policy. Kazempour, citing Zanganeh’s letter, asked the board to include in the June talks an agenda item titled “OPEC Ministerial Conference support to the Member Countries that are under illegal, unilateral and extraterritorial sanctions”. The source said that after receiving Kazempour’s request, the UAE’s OPEC governor Ahmed al-Kaabi sought the advice of legal counsel. The counsel responded negatively to Iran’s plea, the source said, on the grounds that the ministerial agenda could not be amended because it had been finalised. Earlier on Friday, Iran criticised a U.S. request that Saudi Arabia pump more oil to cover a drop in Iranian exports and predicted OPEC would not heed the appeal.

2018-06-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran said on Friday a U.S. request for Saudi Arabia to pump more oil so that it could cover a drop in Iranian exports was “crazy and astonishing” and said OPEC would not heed the appeal, setting the stage for a tough OPEC meeting this month. Iran, Saudi Arabia’s arch-rival, has a history of raising challenges in OPEC meetings. In 2015, Tehran refused to sign up to OPEC policies, saying it needed to hike output due to the easing of sanctions after a nuclear accord with world powers. U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of that nuclear deal last month and announced the “highest level” of sanctions against Iran, the biggest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries after Saudi Arabia and Iraq. “It’s crazy and astonishing to see instruction coming from Washington to Saudi to act and replace a shortfall of Iran’s export due to their Illegal sanction on Iran and Venezuela,” Iran’s OPEC governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili told Reuters. U.S. President Donald Trump said in April oil prices were artificially high because of OPEC.  The U.S. government had also unofficially asked Saudi Arabia and some other OPEC producers to raise output a day before Washington slapped new sanctions on Tehran. In the previous round of sanctions against Tehran, in which the European Union had taken part, Iranian oil exports plummeted by more than half to below 1 million barrels per day. The EU is not planning to join sanctions this time and has called on the United States to give its companies waivers so they can continue doing business with Tehran. But many European companies are already severing ties with Tehran for fear of facing secondary sanctions from the United States, which could mean losing access to the U.S. dollar clearing system. The U.S. sanctions on Iran’s petroleum industry will take effect after a 180-day “wind-down period” ending on Nov. 4 but many European refiners are already winding down Iranian oil purchases. Iran has called on OPEC to discuss what it called “illegal” sanctions at the next meeting on June 22, which is due to debate production policies. OPEC and its allies led by Russia have cut a combined 1.8 million barrels per day of output since January 2017 and the cuts are due to expire at the end of 2018. However, Saudi Arabia and Russia have said cuts could be eased after receiving calls from consumers including the United States, China and India to support global demand. Iran’s Kazempour predicted OPEC would not heed the U.S. request and said oil prices would jump in response to Washington’s sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, as they did during a previous round of U.S. sanctions against Iran. “No one in OPEC will act against two of its founder members,” he said. “The U.S. tried it last time against Iran, but oil prices got to $140 a barrel.”OPEC, founded in 1960, has a history of collaboration over oil policy despite differences of opinion and even wars between some members over the years.Kazempour said the group would unite in opposition to the U.S. request. “OPEC will not accept such a humiliation. How arrogant and ignorant one could be (to) underestimate the history of 60 years’ cooperation among competitors,” he said.”We have to live together - we cannot change geography but we must build better history,” he said.

2018-06-08,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Environmentalists and aid agencies urged executives of the world’s top oil companies attending a Vatican conference on climate change on Friday to heed Pope Francis’s warnings about global warming. Pope Francis, who wrote a major document on protecting the environment from global warming in 2015, will address the some 40 participants - including leading oil and gas executives and major industry investors - on Saturday. The oil and gas industry has come under growing pressure from investors and activists to play a bigger role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions to meet goals set out in a 2015 climate agreement signed in Paris. Companies are betting on increased demand for gas, the least polluting fossil fuel, and to a lesser extent on renewable power such as wind and solar to meet global targets of net zero emissions by the end of the century. The Vatican has been tight-lipped about the closed-door event. But a Vatican source said the heads or senior executives of companies including ExxonMobil, Eni, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Norway’s Equinor and Pemex were expected. “Oil CEOs would do well to find common cause with the pope and ensure that their skilled staff and deep balance sheets are deployed to ensure that business is a force for good,” said Nigel Topping, head of We Mean Business, a non-profit coalition which works with businesses to promote action on climate change. As severe weather events hit least developed countries hardest, many investors were demanding that companies take heed of the Paris targets, he told Reuters. The conference, titled “Energy Transition and Care for Our Common Home”, is being held in the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, housed in a secluded 16th century villa in the Vatican gardens. “If energy companies are serious about caring for our common home, they need to take the pope’s advice and hurry up with shifting their priorities – and therefore their money – from fossil fuels to renewables,” Neil Thorns, director of advocacy at Catholic aid agency CAFOD in London, said in a statement. Groups such as CAFOD or We Mean Business are not taking part in the meeting, which is exclusively for oil executives and investors. The participants will hear talks by top Vatican officials including Cardinal Peter Turkson, head of the Vatican’s department on promoting human development, who is a firm backer of the need to stem global warming. In the 2015 encyclical, called “Laudato Si (Praise Be), On the Care of Our Common Home”, Francis, the first pope from a developing nation, called for policies to drastically reduce polluting gases, saying technology based on fossil fuels “needs to be progressively replaced without delay.” Eldar Saetre, CEO of Norwegian oil firm Equinor, which changed its name from Statoil last month as part of a campaign to broaden away from its roots as an oil producer, is attending. “We look forward to the dialogue, and the opportunity to discuss how we can address climate change and opportunities in the energy transition,” Equinor spokesman Baard Glad Pedersen said.

2018-06-08,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * MSCI ACWI set to break 3-week streak of losses * Focus on G7 meeting this weekend * Talk of Fed, ECB tightening adds to risk-off sentiment * Asian shares close lower; Europe opens in the red * Dollar rebounds, Italy bonds under renewed pressure By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, June 8 (Reuters) - World stocks slipped on Friday as expectations that trade tensions will dominate this weekend’s summit of G7 countries and renewed talk of monetary tightening by major central banks weighed on risk sentiment. The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down nearly half a percent by afternoon in Europe, although it was still on track to break a three-week streak of losses. Futures indicated Wall Street was set to open lower.  NQc1> Fears of a trade war, expectations of more rate hikes in the United States, and the prospect that the European Central Bank will soon signal a winding-down of its massive monetary stimulus all contributed to the risk-off tone, investors said. The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates next week, its second hike this year, and may hint at four rate increases in 2018 rather than the three that have been widely anticipated. ECB policymakers meeting on June 14 will debate whether to end bond purchases later this year, the bank’s chief economist said this week. His hawkish message sent the euro to a three-week top, hit emerging markets, and spurred demand for safe-haven bonds. Before those meetings, however, markets will watch the fallout from the G7 summit in Quebec, where the mounting risk of a tariff war between the United States and its major trade partners will be in the spotlight. Officials concede the mood around the summit is likely to be exceptionally tense. U.S. President Donald Trump says tariffs are needed to protect U.S. industry, but Canada and the European Union have denounced them as illegal and are preparing retaliatory measures. French President Emmanuel Macron warned Trump in a rare rebuke on Thursday that the other six members of the G7 could form their own grouping if necessary, adding that “nobody is forever”. “None of this makes investors particularly hopeful that the two ‘allies’ will reach an agreement and avoid an escalation of the trade spat that has caused so much worry for investors,” said OANDA markets analyst Craig Erlam. “They (investors) may have taken last week’s tariffs in their stride, largely because it had been lined up for months and priced in” but further escalations will hit confidence in the markets and could trigger further corrections, he added. An unprecedented U.S.-North Korea summit scheduled for June 12 in Singapore, with Washington seeking to pressure Pyongyang into abandoning its nuclear weapons programme, is giving investors another reason for caution. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.1 percent after six straight sessions of gains took it to its highest since mid-March. It was on track for a weekly gain of more than 1 percent. Chinese shares slipped, with the blue-chip Shangai-Shenzhen index down 1.7 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng .HSI declining 1.5 percent. Japan’s Nikkei average and South Korea’s KOSPI were off 0.6 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively, while Australian shares ended 0.1 percent lower. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was on track for its third weekly loss in a row, with renewed strength in the euro also weighing. It was last down 0.3 percent. Italy’s government bonds faced renewed selling pressure, as the risk aversion in world markets and unease about Rome’s spending plans set yields on short-dated debt up for their biggest weekly rise since 2012. “A few things are contributing to nervousness today — the trade issues are back on, then there is the Italy situation and we are not sure how the ECB will respond to that,” said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. “And in emerging markets there are some idiosyncratic risks (Turkey, Argentina and Brazil) which are becoming worrying.” He remained “cautious” on adding risk, as “none of these issues seem to have a clear short-term resolution.” The dollar rebounded almost half a percent from near three-week lows against a basket of currencies, helped by the strong jobless claims numbers in the U.S. on Thursday. It has come under pressure this week as the euro bounced back from 10-month lows thanks to ebbing political concerns over Italy and the possible ECB moves over its bond purchases. The dollar fell against the Japanese yen to 109.25, but remained well below a four-month top of 111.39 touched in May. The euro fell over half a percent to $1.1732 after four straight sessions of gains took it to its highest since mid-May. In commodities, copper was off a 4-1/2-year high touched on Wednesday. Oil prices fell as surging U.S. output and signs of weakening demand in China outweighed support from supply woes in Venezuela and OPEC’s production cuts. U.S. crude fell over half a percent to $65.59 a barrel, while Brent dropped 0.9 percent to $76.64. Spot gold slipped 0.1 percent at $1,298.63 an ounce.

2018-06-08,"* Sibur plans new large gas chemical complex in Russia’s Far East * Investments seen at $7 bln-$8 bln, to be shared with a partner * No comment on talks with Sinopec * Plant is part of broader Russian plan to supply gas to China By Oksana Kobzeva MOSCOW, June 8 (Reuters) - Russian petrochemical company Sibur said its plans to build a gas chemical complex in Russia’s Far East will require preliminary investments of up to $8 billion and it is still looking for Asian partners. Sibur said a year ago that it had been in talks with a number of Chinese investors about participating in the project to build the complex in Amur. Sibur’s Chief Executive Officer Dmitry Konov told Reuters in a recent interview, that the company, Russia’s largest petrochemicals company, was still talking to investors, without giving details on their progress. “We look at the implementation of the Amur complex as a joint venture, that’s why the investments will be shared among the partners,” Konov said. He estimated preliminary investments in the Amur complex at $7 billion-$8 billion. The plant will be built to serve Asian markets as part of a broader plan by Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom to supply gas to China. Gazprom will supply the complex with around 2 million tonnes of ethane per year. The plant will also enable Sibur to diversify into Asia. “The location of the Far Eastern project is not usual for us,” Konov said. “At the moment, our supplies to Asia are not that big. That’s why we see benefits in Asian partners.” Sibur said last year that it had been in talks with China’s Sinopec, which holds a 10 percent stake in Sibur, about investment in the project. A spokeswoman for Sibur declined to comment on Friday on whether Sinopec might invest in the project. Konov said in March that a final decision on investments would be taken next year. Sibur expects the plant to start operating after 2024, following the launch of Gazprom’s own gas processing plant, also called Amur, which will process the gas before it is exported to China. Sibur’s complex will produce different forms of ethylene from the gas supplied by Gazprom’s plant. Sibur currently mainly serves clients in the former Soviet Union, although its polymer exports are set to rise with the launch of a $9 billion plant in Tobolsk in Western Siberia by 2020. Sibur also has been in talks with Saudi Aramco to set up a venture to produce synthetic rubber, a move highlighting growing cooperation between OPEC leader Saudi Arabia and Russia, the biggest non-OPEC oil exporter. Businessman Leonid Mikhelson, the head of and a major shareholder in Russia’s largest gas producer Novatek, owns 48.5 percent of Sibur. His business partner Gennady Timchenko owns 17 percent, while China’s Sinopec and Silk Fund control 10 percent each. Once the Amur and Tobolsk plants are up and running, Sibur will cut exports of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), the feed stock for petrochemicals production. Analysts forecast production in the former Soviet Union of basic polymers, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, will more than double to 9.6 million tonnes per year by 2024, from 4 million tonnes in 2017. Demand for basic polymers in the former Soviet Union is expected to rise to 5.3 million tonnes, from 4 million tonnes.

2018-06-08,"LONDON, June 8 (Reuters) - Bond funds suffered large redemptions in the week to June 6 with those targeting investment grade debt suffering their biggest outflows since December 2016, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) said on Friday. The bank’s data, which tracks fund flows from Wednesday to Wednesday, showed that investors withdrew $5.5 billion from bond funds and $500 million from precious metals but put $900 million to work in equities. Global bond markets had come under pressure in recent weeks from a combination of escalating trade tensions, the tremors of heightened political risk across the euro zone over Italy’s attempts to form a government and the prospect of major central banks raising interest rates and tapering stimulus. “Fed late-cycle tightening, investors short leverage/long secular growth = turbo-charging U.S. versus EU/EM,” BAML analysts wrote in their weekly note. Breaking down fixed income flows, investors pulled $2.2 billion from investment grade bonds, inflicting the biggest outflows in 1-1/2 years. But riskier assets also suffered, with high-yield bonds recording a $3 billion outflow in their fifth straight week in the red while investors withdrew $1.9 billion from emerging market debt in a seventh straight week of outflows. BAML predicted there may be more pain ahead. “Bad summer news for risk assets: QE security blanket for markets has vanished ... investors targeting weak credit stories; emerging markets now in tightening cycle and ECB (who else?) threatening a QE taper policy mistake in autumn,” the bank’s analysts wrote, adding they remained defensive and happy to sell risk assets into strength until the Fed was forced to pause. “Big risk is, as in 1998, credit tremors spread and investors forced to deleverage from risk assets, raise cash ... when investors delever they can only sell what they own.” The bank also said its private clients’ cash levels currently stood at new lows of 9.9 percent of assets under management, testifying to their appetite for risk. Meanwhile investors put their money to work in equities, with Japanese stocks taking in a massive $3.8 billion while U.S. equity funds added a modest $40 million. Europe continued to see massive outflows, losing $4 billion and taking year-to-date outflows to more than $17 billion. Looking at the sector breakdown, tech stocks reaped their second highest inflows at $2.3 billion, while materials, healthcare and real estate stocks all added $400 million. “One big flow winner in Q2: Tech...2nd biggest week ever; $17.3 billion year-to-date on pace for record,” BAML analysts noted.

2018-06-08,"MOSCOW, June 8 (Reuters) - The Russian rouble eased on Friday as oil prices fell on a weaker China demand and surging U.S. output. At 0932 GMT, the rouble was 0.52 percent weaker against the dollar at 62.74 and had lost 0.27 percent to trade at 73.84 versus the euro. Oil prices eased, reversing early gains as signs of weakening demand in China and surging U.S. output weighed on markets despite support from supply woes in Venezuela and OPEC’s production cuts. But the China data provided good news for Beijing policymakers as they deal with tough trade negotiations with Washington. Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia’s main export, was down 0.34 percent at $77.06 a barrel. The global risk appetite towards the emerging markets has narrowed, which has also partially affected the Russian market, analysts at Rosbank said in a note. “Even the macroeconomic advantages haven’t yet pushed non-residents to move their investments into Russian risk (from other emerging markets),” Rosbank said, adding that Russian assets would be still affected by global markets moods. The rouble felt support from market expectations that the Central Bank would not cut its key rate on June 15 as inflation risks had increased because of the rise in oil product prices in May. The finance ministry has proposed increasing the maximum level of export duty for light oil products to 90 percent as an emergency measure to tackle spikes in gasoline and diesel prices. “We believe that the Central Bank may take a pause before the situation with specific government measures will be clarified,” analysts at Rosbank said on Friday. Russian stock indexes were down. The dollar-denominated RTS index was down 1.17 percent to 1,156 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was 0.46 percent lower at 2,305 points.

2018-06-08,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * MSCI ACWI set to break 3-week streak of losses * Focus on G7 meeting this weekend * Talk of Fed, ECB tightening adds to risk-off sentiment * Asian shares close lower; Europe opens in the red * Dollar rebounds, Italy bonds under renewed pressure By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, June 8 (Reuters) - World stocks slipped on Friday as expectations of trade tensions dominating this weekend’s summit of G7 countries, along with renewed talk of monetary tightening by major central banks, weighed on risk sentiment. The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down nearly half a percent in morning trade in Europe - though it was still set to break a three-week streak of losses. Fears of a trade war, expectations of more rate hikes in the United States, and a wind-down of a massive monetary stimulus in Europe fuelled a risk-off tone in markets, investors said. The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates for a second time this year next week. The focus is on whether it will hint at raising rates four times in 2018. European Central Bank policymakers meeting on June 14 will debate whether to end bond purchases later this year, the bank’s chief economist said this week, in a hawkish message that sent the euro to a three-week top, hit emerging markets, and spurred demand for safe-haven bonds. Before those meetings, however, markets will have to digest fallout from the G7 summit in Quebec, where the mounting risk of a tariff war between the United States and its major trade partners will be in the spotlight. An unprecedented U.S.-North Korea summit scheduled for June 12 in Singapore, with Washington seeking to pressure Pyongyang into abandoning its nuclear weapons programme, is giving investors another reason for caution. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.1 percent after six straight sessions of gains took it to its highest since mid-March. It was on track for a weekly gain of more than 1 percent. Chinese shares slipped, with the blue-chip Shangai-Shenzhen index down 1.7 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng .HSI declining 1.5 percent. Japan’s Nikkei average and South Korea’s KOSPI were off 0.6 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively, while Australian shares ended 0.1 percent lower. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was on track for its third weekly loss in a row, with renewed strength in the euro also weighing. It was down 0.7 percent. Italy’s government bonds faced renewed selling pressure, as the risk aversion in world markets and unease about Rome’s spending plans set yields on short-dated debt up for their biggest weekly rise since 2012. “A few things are contributing to nervousness today — the trade issues are back on, then there is the Italy situation and we are not sure how the ECB will respond to that,” said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Management. “And in emerging markets there are some idiosyncratic risks (Turkey, Argentina and Brazil) which are becoming worrying.” He remained “cautious” on adding risk, as “none of these issues seem to have a clear short-term resolution.” The dollar rebounded 0.3 percent from near three-week lows against a basket of currencies, helped by the strong jobless claims numbers in the U.S. on Thursday. The dollar has come under pressure this week as the euro bounced back from 10-month lows thanks to an ebbing of political concerns over Italy as well as the possible ECB moves over its bond purchases. The dollar fell against the safe-haven Japanese yen to 109.35, but remained well below a four-month top of 111.39 touched in May. The euro inched down to $1.1763 after four straight session of gains took it to its highest level since mid-May. In commodities, copper came off from a 4-1/2-year high touched on Wednesday. Oil prices fell as surging U.S. output and signs of weakening demand in China output outweighed support from supply woes in Venezuela and OPEC’s production cuts. U.S. crude fell 0.5 percent to $65.64 a barrel, while Brent dropped 0.5 percent to $76.95. Spot gold slipped 0.1 percent at $1,298.47 an ounce.

Imports also rose more than anticipated in May and at the fastest pace since January, with the data coming at a time when China has pledged to its trade partners - including the United States - that steps would be taken to increase imports. China, the world’s largest exporter, has so far escaped any major blow to its foreign trade sector despite rising trade tensions with the United States, which last week warned it would continue to pursue tariffs on Chinese imports. That bodes well for the world’s second-largest economy, as policymakers tighten access to credit domestically to prevent asset bubbles and limit heavy industry in many regions as part of a big effort to clean up severe air, water and soil pollution. “Trade performance in Q2 so far has been better than expected and may offer some upside to Q2 GDP growth,” Betty Wang, senior China Economist at ANZ, wrote in a note. But trade tensions with the U.S. remain a risk. A third round of talks between the two economic heavyweights concluded in Beijing last weekend with few signs of progress, as China issued a counter-warning that any trade and business deals reached with Washington would be void if the United States implemented tariffs. The median forecast from a Reuters survey of 32 analysts had pointed to 10 percent export growth in May, but the actual outturn showed little loss of momentum, coming in just a shade below the 12.7 percent growth posted in April. Irrespective of chances of a trade war, analysts warn that China’s export growth is likely to stall. “Even if a trade war is avoided, Chinese trade growth is still likely to edge down over the coming year as the global economy loses momentum and headwinds to domestic demand from slower credit growth intensify,” Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note following the data. Imports grew 26 percent in May, the General Administration of Customs said, beating analysts’ forecast of 18.7 percent growth, and compared with a 21.5 percent rebound in April. Strong growth in imports were driven by purchases of computer chips as well as commodities including agricultural crude oil, copper ore and concentrate and natural gas. China is reported to be importing record volumes of U.S. oil and is likely to buy more U.S. soy after Beijing signalled to state-run refiners and grains purchasers they should buy more to help ease trade tensions. Among major trading partners, China’s imports from Australia saw biggest turnaround in growth in May, rising 22.4 percent year-on-year after falling 3.1 percent in April. Imports from South Korea rose 31.8 percent in May. China’s imports and exports both showed stronger growth over the first five months of the year than they did during the same period a year ago, customs data shows. China’ trade surplus narrowed to $24.92 billion in May from $28.38 billion in April, and came in well below analysts forecasts for a $31.9 billion surplus. Still a widening in China’s surplus with the United States is likely to further irritate Washington. China’s exports to the United States rose 11.6 percent in May from a year earlier, compared with a 9.7 percent rise in April. Its imports from the United States rose 11.4 percent in May, far slower than the 20.3 percent growth shown in April. That widened China’s surplus with the United States to $24.58 billion in May from $22.15 billion in April, according to Reuters calculations based on customs data released on Friday. For January-May, the surplus stood at $104.85 billion, compared with about $92.9 billion in the same period last year. China and the United States had appeared to have been on the verge of a truce over trade until the White House warned in late May that it would pursue tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports, as well as impose restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States and tighter export controls. A final list of Chinese imports subject to 25 percent tariffs will be announced on June 15, with more detailed investment restrictions to be unveiled by the end of the month. China agreed to import more energy and agricultural commodities to narrow the $335 billion annual U.S. goods and services trade deficit with China following intensive talks in Washington last month. Beijing also said it would cut tariffs on nearly 1,500 consumer products as it looks to boost imports as part of efforts to open up the economy. But analysts say it would be a tall order for China to cut its trade surplus by $200 billion a year as the White House is demanding. To do so, it would have to buy the equivalent of more than 600 Boeing airliners annually. So far, China’s customs hasn’t released final April commodities trade statistics which had been due on May 23, and some traders have speculated that Beijing may want to conceal statistics that could somehow undermine its negotiating stance.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.1 percent after six straight sessions of gains took it to the highest since mid-March. It was still on track for a weekly gain of more than 1 percent. Chinese shares slipped, with the blue-chip Shangai-Shenzhen index down 1.7 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng declining 1.5 percent. Japan’s Nikkei average and South Korea’s KOSPI were off 0.6 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively, while Australian shares ended 0.1 percent lower. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended lower on Thursday while Treasuries gained. Spreadbetters expected the weaker tone in equities to carry over into Europe, forecasting a lower open for Britain’s FTSE , Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC. Risk appetite waned after U.S. jobless claims pointed to a further tightening in labour market conditions, cementing expectations the Federal Reserve will raise benchmark U.S. rates next week and twice again later in the year. Its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) holds a two-day meeting starting on June 12 that is is widely expected to result in the second interest rate increase of the year. The focus is on whether the central bank will hint at raising rates a total of four times in 2018. European Central Bank policymakers meeting on June 14 will debate whether to end bond purchases later this year, the bank’s chief economist said on Wednesday, giving a hawkish message that sent the euro to a three-week top, hit emerging markets, and spurred demand for safe-haven bonds. “Markets are having to rediscover how to price risk amid reduced central bank buying and that adjustment could prove very hard,” said Matt King, Citi’s global head of credit strategy. Before those key central bank meetings, markets will have to digest the fallout from this weekend’s Group of Seven summit in Quebec, where the mounting risk of tariff wars between the United States and its major trade partners will be in the spotlight. “I care about the upcoming FOMC meeting more than G7 summit this weekend,” said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments. “I’m not talking about the rate hike this month, which has already been priced in the market, but the pace of rate increases beyond June. Foreign speculative investors appear to be pulling out of emerging markets, including Latin America and Asia.” The upcoming, historic U.S.-Korea summit in Singapore on June 12, where the main issue is whether North Korea will abandon its nuclear weapons programme, gave investors another reason for caution. In emerging market currencies, the South African rand , Brazil’s real and the Mexican peso were the worst hit overnight. “Risk trades were lower across the board in the currency markets as the yen and Swiss francs appreciated against the greenback and on the crosses. We saw more volatility in the emerging markets,” said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Racketing Securities Australia. The U.S. dollar rebounded 0.2 percent from near three-week lows against a basket of currencies, helped by the strong jobless numbers. The dollar has come under pressure this week as the euro bounced back from 10-month lows thanks to an ebb in Italian political concerns and speculation that the ECB could signal intentions to start unwinding its bond purchasing programme. On Friday, the euro inched down to $1.1782 after four straight session of gains took it to the highest level since mid-May. The greenback was little changed against the safe-haven Japanese yen at 109.63, but remained well below a four-month top of 111.39 touched in May. In commodities, copper came off from a 4-1/2-year high touched on Wednesday. Oil prices reversed earlier gains and fell as surging U.S. output as well as signs of weakening demand in China weighed on markets, even though supply woes in Venezuela and OPEC’s ongoing production cuts offered crude some support.

May shipments were 39.05 million tonnes, or 9.2 million barrels per day (bpd), according to data released on Friday by the General Administration of Customs. That compared to 9.6 million bpd in April and 8.76 million bpd in May, 2017. Imports for the first five months of 2018 were 190 million tonnes, customs said, without giving a comparison. Based on last year’s figures, the year-to-date levels represent an increase of 7.8 percent over a year earlier. Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical, Sinopec Yangzi and PetroChina’s Dalian and Jilin were scheduled for regular major repair works between April and May. At least five independent plants in the eastern province of Shandong have been ordered to cut operating rates as Beijing aims for blue skies for a regional summit in the port city of Qingdao in June. But May imports were up nearly 5 percent from a year earlier and were not too far off record levels as margins remained healthy for large state refiners. “Overall, independents continued to be the main driver for incremental growth due to more quotas, and state refiners PetroChina and CNOOC also contributed to a large extent to the imports due to commissioning of new plants,” said Seng-Yick Tee of consultancy SIA Energy. Fresh from the completion of a planned shutdown, Sinopec’s second-largest plant, Maoming in the southern province of Guangdong, processed at record rates in May Data also showed China’s refined fuel exports reached 6.13 million tonnes, up from 5.12 million tonnes in May and off a record 6.69 million tonnes in March. Fuel exports are handled exclusively by state-run firms which have been granted a total of around 43 million tonnes of export quotas for the whole of 2018, a level flat with last year. China’s natural gas imports - including pipeline gas and liquefied natural gas - were 7.4 million tonnes in May, up 36.5 percent from a year-ago level, as companies maintained strong buying to fill storage and cover robust industrial demand.

2018-06-08,"PAHOA, Hawaii (Reuters) - Approximately 600 homes have been swallowed by lava flows from Kilauea Volcano on Hawaii’s Big Island since early last month, marking its most destructive eruption in modern times, Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim said on Thursday. The latest estimate of property losses from Kilauea, one of the world’s most active volcanoes, far surpasses the 215 structures consumed by lava during an earlier eruption cycle that began in 1983 and continued nearly nonstop over three decades. Kim said Kilauea, one of five volcanoes on the Big Island, formally known as the Island of Hawaii, has never destroyed so many homes before in such a short period of time. The latest volcanic eruption, which entered its 36th day on Thursday, stands as the most destructive in the United States since at least the cataclysmic 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington state that reduced hundreds of square miles to wasteland, according to geologist Scott Rowland, a volcano specialist from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. A similar, extremely violent eruption from Fuego volcano in Guatemala this week killed more than 100 people as it ejected deadly super-heated “pyroclastic” flows of lava and ash through nearby towns.  The latest damage appraisal from Kilauea came moments after Governor David Ige, on a visit to Hawaii County Civil Defense headquarters in Hilo, the island’s biggest city, signed a memorandum of understanding furnishing $12 million in immediate state disaster relief to the island. Ige and Kim also announced formation of a task force of federal, state and local officials to devise a recovery plan for communities devastated by the eruption, with an eye toward preventing such major property losses in the future. “Our responsibility is to try to work with the community to rebuild out of harm’s way,” Kim said. County civil defence officials had a day earlier put the confirmed number of homes destroyed during the past month at 130, all of them in and around the Leilani Estates community, where lava-spouting fissures opened up on the volcano’s eastern flank on May 3. More recently a huge river of lava that has crept several miles across the landscape to the eastern tip of the island  engulfed two entire seaside housing subdivisions - Kapoho Beach Lots and Vacationland.  Over the course of about three days, a rolling wall of molten rock measuring half-mile across and 10- to 15-feet tall buried hundreds of homes, while vaporizing a small freshwater lake and filling in an inlet called Kapoho Bay, extending about a mile out from what had been the shoreline. Kim said Vacationland, a private development believed to comprise roughly 160 homes, was completely erased, and that at least 330 houses were devoured by lava at Kapoho Beach Lots. The rest were  The rest of the losses have occurred in the Leilani Estates area, where the toll of destruction has been steadily rising by the day. “So if you combine the three of them (Kapoho, Vacationland and Leilani), we’re talking about 600 homes,” he told reporters. “I’m talking about 600 families. Don’t forget the farmers, don’t forget the ranchers, don’t forget all the employees for them.” An estimated 2,500 people have been displaced by evacuations across the island since the eruption began five weeks ago, spouting fountains of lava and high concentrations of toxic sulphur dioxide gas through about two dozen volcanic fissures at the foot of the volcano. Plumes of volcanic ash belched into the air by periodic daily explosions from the crater at Kilauea’s summit have posed an additional nuisance and health hazard to nearby communities. So too have airborne volcanic glass fibres, called “Peel’s Hair,” wispy strands carried aloft by the wind from lava fountains and named for the volcanic goddess of Hawaiian myth. Seaside residents and boaters also have been warned to avoid noxious clouds of laze - a term derived from the words “lava” and “haze” - formed when lava reacts with seawater to form a mix of acid fumes, steam and glass-like particles when it flows into the ocean. Frequent earthquakes, mostly of relatively small magnitude but numbering in the thousands, have persisted throughout the eruption, adding to the jitters of residents living closest to the volcano.  In addition to destroying homes and other structures, lava flows have knocked out telephone and power lines, causing widespread communication outages, and forced the shutdown of a geothermal energy plant that normally provides about a quarter of the island’s electricity.

2018-06-08,"* Newcastle coal at $115.25/t, highest since Feb. 2012 * Coal rally triggers surge in specialist mining shares * Whitehaven Coal shares hit highest level since 2011 * Coal far outperforms competing LNG market By Henning Gloystein and Sonali Paul SINGAPORE/MELBOURNE, June 8 (Reuters) - Australian thermal coal prices have risen to their highest level since 2012 as hot weather across North Asia spurs buying ahead of the peak summer demand season. Spot prices for thermal coal cargoes for export from Australia’s Newcastle terminal last closed at $115.25 per tonne, the highest level since February 2012. Thermal coal, the world’s most used fuel for electricity generation, has surged by 130 percent since its record lows below $50 per tonne in 2016 following a years-long decline. Prices have been driven up by economic growth, especially in Asia, along with constraints on supply due to earlier mine closures and high hurdles to developing new mines amid concerns about pollution and global warming. In recent weeks, a heat-wave in North Asia and restocking ahead of the hottest summer months in July and August have led to soaring demand for both residential and industrial cooling, traders said. Weather data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows that large parts of North Asia, including cities like Beijing and Tokyo have experienced unusually warm weather since late May. Supply disruptions from South African miners have also pushed up Newcastle prices, as buyers shifted towards Australia to meet demand. “Supply is tight out of Australia. What has also happened is exports out of South Africa are down... That opens up the market for more Australian coal into Asia,” said Shane Stephan, Managing Director at New Hope, Australia’s third largest independent coal producer. The increased demand for the North Asian summer has led to a traffic-jam of dozens of ships waiting at Newcastle to load coal. “You are seeing some real competition for access to thermal coal during this restocking phase in Asia,” Stephan said. “I suspect that pricing could go a little higher yet.” The bull-run is providing Australian coal miners like New Hope and Whitehaven Coal with a revenue boost in an industry that is being increasingly shunned by investors because of its high levels of pollution. New Hope shares have more than doubled from their 2016 lows, to around A$2 a share, while Whitehaven shares have jumped 16-fold from their 2016 lows, to almost A$6. Australian coal miners like Whitehaven and New Hope have far outperformed even companies specialising in the booming liquefied natural gas (LNG) market, such as Australia’s Santos Ltd, which in May rejected a $10.8 billion takeover offer.

2018-06-08,"(Recasts lead, adds analyst comments, updates levels throughout) * MSCI ex-Japan slip from 2-1/2 month highs * Euro near three-week highs as ECB seen tapering stimulus * U.S. jobless claims drops, pointing to tightening labour market * Copper at 4-1/2 year highs, oil prices strong By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, June 8 (Reuters) - Asian shares stepped back from a 2-1/2 month high on Friday as risk appetite soured on bets that Europe’s massive monetary stimulus was nearing an end, compounded by uncertainty over  trade relations ahead of a key meeting of global leaders. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.5 percent after six straight sessions of gains took it to the highest since mid-March. Chinese shares slipped, with the blue-chip Shangai-Shenzhen index down 0.6 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng declined 0.7 percent while South Korea’s KOSPI was off 0.4 percent. Japan’s Nikkei and Australian shares were barely changed. The European Central Bank will debate next week whether to end bond purchases later this year, the bank’s chief economist said on Wednesday, a hawkish message that sent the euro to a three-week top, hit emerging markets, and spurred demand for safe-haven bonds. “Markets are having to rediscover how to price risk amid reduced central bank buying and that adjustment could prove very hard,” said Matt King, Citi’s global head of credit strategy. Another major reason for the nerves was the widening rift between the United States and its major trade partners after President Donald Trump imposed import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports last week. Trump seemed in no mood to reconcile when he tweeted, just one day before a Group of Seven summit, that France and Canada imposed “massive tariffs” on their imports from the United States and had non-monetary barriers to trade. The summit takes place on Friday and Saturday in Charlevoix, Quebec. “Uncertainly ahead of the weekend’s G7 meeting led to a downturn in risk appetite throughout the U.S. session,” said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Racketing Securities Australia. “Risk trades were lower across the board in the currency markets as the yen and Swiss francs appreciated against the greenback and on the crosses. We saw more volatility in the emerging markets.” The S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended lower on Wednesday while Treasuries gained. In emerging market currencies, the South African rand , Brazil’s real and the Mexican peso were the worst hit overnight. Risk appetite also waned after U.S. jobless claims pointed to a further tightening in labour market conditions, cementing expectations the Federal Reserve will raise benchmark U.S. rates next week and twice again later in the year. Investors also looked to a historic U.S.-Korea summit in Singapore on June 12 where the main issue is whether North Korea will abandon its nuclear weapons programme. The U.S. dollar inched up a bit from near three-week lows against a basket of currencies, helped by the strong jobless numbers. The euro paused at $1.1804 after four straight session of gains took it to the highest level since mid-May. The greenback also ticked up against the safe-haven Japanese yen to 109.79, but remained well below a four-month top of 111.39 touched in May. In commodities, copper came off from a 4-1/2-year high touched on Wednesday. Oil prices were boosted by worries over a steep drop in exports from crisis-plagued Venezuela, which faces the threat of U.S. sanctions. U.S. crude rose 13 cents to $66.08 a barrel, while Brent added 1 cent to $77.33. Spot gold was steady at $1,296.40 an ounce. Reporting by Swati Pandey

2018-06-08,"HOUSTON/PUNTO FIJO, Venezuela (Reuters) - Venezuela has begun testing seaborne oil transfers to ease a severe backlog of crude deliveries from its main terminals, according to sources and data, as chronic delays and production declines could temporarily halt state-run PDVSA’s supply contracts if they are not cleared soon. The company has told some customers it may declare force majeure, allowing it to temporarily suspend export contracts, if they do not accept new delivery terms, including seaborne transfers.  The delivery method entails specialized equipment and training and higher costs for ship owners and customers. But PDVSA is pushing ahead over customer doubts given the congestion at its ports and need to complete sales that are the lifeblood of the OPEC member.  Tankers waiting to load more than 24 million barrels of crude, almost as much as PDVSA shipped in April, are sitting off Jose, the country’s main oil port, according to the data.  PDVSA did not reply to requests for comment. The delays helped push up Brent crude oil prices LCOc1 on Thursday. Brent rose 2.6 percent to settle at $77.32 per barrel. [O/R]  The tanker Sonangol Kalandula, bound for a Thailand company’s refinery in Kemaman, Malaysia, was loaded this week with Venezuelan heavy crude using a ship-to-ship (STS) transfer, the first test of how PDVSA expects to ease congestion at its ports.  The vessel, which has not yet set sail, had been waiting since February to load, according to Thomson Reuters vessel tracking data. The cargo’s owner, Tipco Asphalt (TASCO.BK), did not reply to a request for comment.  As of Thursday, more than 80 tankers were waiting in Venezuelan waters, half of them to load crude and refined products for exports, according to the data. GRAPHIC on PDVSA's oil export delays: tmsnrt.rs/2JqWNoI The delays have mounted since May, when asset seizures forced PDVSA to stop using Caribbean facilities for storing and loading export cargoes. But PDVSA’s noncompliance with oil supply contracts started months ago as production declines accelerated, according to internal company documents. In April, PDVSA shipped 1.49 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude and fuels to its customers, 665,000 bpd below the 2.15 million contracted, according to the documents. Customers waiting for cargoes with tankers already at sea include U.S.-based Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N), India’s Nayara Energy and China’s CNPC and its trading unit PetroChina Co Ltd (601857.SS). PDVSA customers including Chevron declined to comment on the new terms. Nayara Energy, Valero Energy and units of CNPC, which each had vessels awaiting loadings on Thursday, did not reply to a request for comment. A senior Chinese state-oil official with direct knowledge of the issue said “the Venezuela side has requested for STS operations, and also agreed to bear the additional cost.” But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had doubts over whether PDVSA could deliver on time and who would be given priority. Another buyer of Venezuelan oil said chances were slim that any customer would contest force majeure, choosing instead to negotiate differences in pricing because of the transfer costs involved.  Venezuela’s crude exports fell 6 percent in May to 1.168 million bpd following U.S. ConocoPhillips’ (COP.N) legal actions to seize PDVSA’s assets in four Caribbean islands, according to Reuters data. Venezuela’s crude exports in the first five months of 2018 were 27 percent lower than in the same period of 2017. The lack of export and storage terminals, especially those with deep-water docks to load large vessels bound for Asia, has forced PDVSA to divert tankers to Venezuela in recent weeks. The measure also has been taken to avoid further cargo seizures, after Conoco won temporary court orders retaining two vessels near Aruba last month. The company’s proposed STS transfer solution, to be performed in waters 6 miles (9.7 km) from Venezuela’s Cardon refinery, faces a reluctant reception among oil buyers, according to shippers and traders. “A STS operation adds at least $1 per barrel to the purchase cost. The question is who will take responsibility for that,” said Robert Campbell, head of oil products markets at consultancy Energy Aspects. The price of Venezuela’s Merey crude, the main grade exported from Jose port, rose to $60.24 per barrel in April. Insurance coverage for tankers and cargoes would also have to be changed to include the STS operation if customers accept the option, Campbell said.

2018-06-08,"* Venezuela struggling to get 24 mln barrels of oil to customers * South American nation’s woes come amid OPEC production cuts * Surging U.S. output widens WTI crude spread to Brent By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, June 8 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Friday, driven up as Venezuela struggles to meet its supply obligations and by ongoing voluntary output cuts led by producer cartel OPEC. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $77.45 per barrel at 0051 GMT, up 13 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 19 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $66.14 a barrel. Prices were pushed up by supply trouble in Venezuela, where state-owned oil firm PDVSA is struggling to clear a backlog of around 24 million barrels of crude waiting to be shipped to customers. Despite this, oil markets are not unanimously bullish. One of the key features of oil markets recently has been the widening discount of U.S. WTI crude versus Brent CL-LCO1=R, which has almost quadrupled since February to $11.40 per barrel, its steepest discount since 2015. “This is occurring because of the rapid increase in production from U.S. shale coupled with the tightening of supplies elsewhere through the actions of OPEC and Russia,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities. Brent has been pushed up by voluntary production cuts led by the Middle East dominated producer cartel of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and by top producer Russia, which were put in place in 2017. The group and Russia are due to meet at its headquarters in Vienna on June 22 to discuss production policy. Looming new U.S. sanctions against major oil exporter Iran have further tightened international oil markets. In North America, however, surging U.S. output has pressured WTI crude futures. U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA hit another record last week at 10.8 million barrels per day (bpd). That’s a 28 percent gain in two years, or an average 2.3 percent growth rate per month since mid-2016 and puts the United States close to becoming the world’s biggest crude oil producer, edging nearer to the 11 million bpd churned out by Russia.

A global trade war threatens the world economy’s first synchronous upturn in several years. E-Minis for the S&P500 and Dow futures were both down about 0.1 percent in early Asian trade on Friday. Nikkei futures slipped 0.6 percent while Australian share futures ticked 0.1 percent lower. In emerging market currencies, the South African rand , Brazil’s real and the Mexican peso were the worst hit overnight.

2018-06-08,"(Adds PHMSA comments) June 7 (Reuters) - TransCanada Corp said it has isolated the section of Columbia Gas Transmission pipe that exploded early Thursday in Moundsville, West Virginia. There were no employees at the site at the time of the blast around 4:15 a.m. EDT (0815 GMT) and no homes were in danger, officials from the Roberts Ridge Volunteer Fire Department told local news media. The company said in a statement that its first priority was to protect the public and the environment. Moundsville is located in Marshall County on the West Virginia panhandle on the Ohio-West Virginia border in the heart of the giant Marcellus and Utica natural gas shale formations. TransCanada said the incident could impact about 1.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas service, according to a notice to customers using the pipeline. One billion cubic feet is enough gas for about five million U.S. homes. The company did not say when it expected the pipe to return to service, but said it was declaring a force majeure. It was too soon for pipeline flow data to show any impact on the movement of gas through the area. The latest data from Thomson Reuters analysts showed West Virginia was producing about 4.8 bcfd of gas, about the same as earlier in the week. The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) said it was investigating the cause of the incident. Fire was reported this morning on Columbia Gas Transmission’s Leach Xpress Pipeline in Marshall County and the line has been shut down, said Darius Kirkwood, a spokesman for the agency. The Leach XPress project, which was placed in-service on January 1, 2018, includes 160 miles (257 kilometres) of 36-inch-diameter pipeline and is capable of transporting approximately 1.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day, TransCanada said earlier this year. The West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) too said it was investigating the explosion. The 12,000-mile (19,312-kilometer) Columbia pipeline system, which TransCanada acquired in 2016, serves millions of customers from New York to the Gulf of Mexico.

2018-06-08,"(Reuters) - Oil producer BP Plc (BP.L) complained to Canada’s National Energy Board (NEB) regulator about Enbridge Inc’s (ENB.TO) implementation and then abrupt reversal of new rules for shipping crude on its Mainline pipeline system, NEB documents showed on Thursday. Enbridge notified shippers late last month that it would introduce a supply verification procedure to determine each company’s volumes on the Mainline, but then scrapped the policy early this week. The NEB said in a letter on Thursday to BP and Enbridge that it would establish a process to hear comments from both companies and anyone else this month. Enbridge’s initial notice of the change caused the discount on Canadian heavy crude against the North American benchmark West Texas Intermediate to widen sharply in sparse trade as shippers worried about transport constrictions. The discount then narrowed rapidly on Monday when Enbridge reversed course. “Unnecessarily injecting uncertainty in how services would be provided to shippers .. is shocking and egregious,” said Jennifer Geggie, vice-president of global oil Americas at BP Products North America, a subsidiary of BP, in a June 6 letter to the NEB. Geggie further noted the reversal was announced during the main trading window for July 2018 shipments and changing pipeline procedure at that point “could cause unintended consequences which could materially harm shippers.” BP also said there was a lack of clarity on whether or not the new supply verification procedures would apply after July 2018, creating further uncertainty for shippers. Enbridge declined to comment on BP’s complaint and said it would file its response with the NEB “in due course.” The Mainline is part of the largest crude oil transportation network in Canada, funnelling oil from Alberta to U.S. refineries. Enbridge has long sought more efficient ways to move oil on the network and prevent shippers from overestimating the product they have to move as they compete for space.
