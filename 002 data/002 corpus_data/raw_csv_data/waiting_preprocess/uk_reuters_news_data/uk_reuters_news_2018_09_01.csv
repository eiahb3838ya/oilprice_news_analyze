2018-09-01,"TUNIS, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Tunisia’s government raised fuel prices on Saturday by about 4 percent, the fourth hike this year, in an effort to rein in its budget deficit and meet reforms requested by the country’s international lenders. The price of a litre of petrol will rise to 1.985 Tunisian dinars from 1.925 dinars, starting Sunday, the industry ministry said in a statement. The three previous increases this year were in March, January and June. Fuel subsidies this year will rise from an expected 1.5 billion dinars to 4.3 billion dinars with the rise of world oil prices, officials said. The IMF has been pressing Tunisia to trim its budget deficit and increase fuel and electricity bills to offset a rise in oil prices that is pressuring already-strained public finances. “Staying the course on reducing the fiscal deficit this year and next is critical to stabilise debt and reduce excessive demand for imports given the recent increase in global oil prices,” the IMF said on Friday after a mission visited the country. The two sides reached an initial, or “staff level”, agreement on the next reforms, the IMF statement added. Tunisia has forecast that the budget deficit will fall to 3.9 percent in 2019 versus 4.9 percent of gross domestic product expected in 2018. The country has dropped into a deep economic slump following the overthrow in 2011 of autocratic leader Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali.

2018-09-01,"DUBAI (Reuters) - A British junior minister held talks in Iran on Saturday as Tehran said European states should take action if they wanted to save Iran’s nuclear deal following Washington’s withdrawal from the accord, Iranian state media reported. “It is time for the Europeans to act in addition to voicing their political commitment,” the state news agency IRNA quoted Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as telling reporters. “These measures may be costly, but if countries want to reap benefits and if they believe the nuclear accord is an international achievement, they should be ready to keep these achievements,” he was quoted as saying. Britain and other European signatories are trying to keep the nuclear deal alive, despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s reimposition of sanctions on Tehran. UK’s Junior Foreign Minister Alistair Burt, on the first visit by a British minister since Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal, earlier met Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s state television reported. Zarif said the talks with Burt had involved “access to banking resources and the sale of oil.” Iran has been seeking commitment from European signatories of the nuclear deal that it will be able to access the Western banking system and continue to sell oil despite U.S. sanctions. In a statement before his visit, Burt said: “As long as Iran meets its commitments under the deal, we remain committed to it as we believe it is the best way to ensure a safe, secure future for the region.”  Zarif later spoke by telephone with his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian, state media reported, saying they discussed bilateral ties, the nuclear deal and regional developments. A day earlier, Iran dismissed a call by Le Drian for negotiations on Tehran’s future nuclear plans, its ballistic missile arsenal and its role in wars in Syria and Yemen. Britain’s Burt was also expected to discuss the cases of dual nationals detained in Iran. Britain is seeking the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation who was arrested in April 2016 at a Tehran airport as she headed back to Britain with her daughter, now aged four, after a family visit. She was convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran’s clerical establishment, a charge denied by her family and the Foundation, a charity organisation that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News. Accompanying Burt in Tehran, London’s special envoy to Syria Martin Longden later met senior Iranian Foreign Ministry official Hosein Jaberi Ansari, IRNA reported. IRNA said Longden had expressed concern about the future of Idlib and the possibility of the use of chemical weapons there. The Syrian province of Idlib and surrounding areas are the last major enclave held by rebels opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a close Iranian ally. A source has told Reuters Assad is preparing a phased offensive to regain the province.

2018-09-01,"(Updates with energy regulator’s statement) By Omar Mohammed NAIROBI, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Kenya’s revenue authority imposed a 16 percent value added tax on all petroleum products on Saturday, defying lawmakers who had voted earlier this week to delay the levy for two years due to concerns about the cost of living. Parliament’s decision on Thursday to postpone the introduction of the tax on fuels, which had been pushed back several times previously, was seen as a blow to government efforts to raise state revenues. But the revenue authority said in a statement it was proceeding based on previously approved budget bills. “Kenya Revenue Authority informs the general public, oil marketers, resellers and retailers that VAT will be charged on all petroleum products at a rate of 16 percent on all transactions with effect from Sept. 1, 2018,” it said. To become law, the bill on delaying the tax that was passed in parliament still needs approval by President Uhuru Kenyatta. The Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) said on Saturday it had recalculated the maximum pump prices that will be in force between Sept 1. and Sept 14 in order to take into account the new VAT. “This notwithstanding, if the amendment to the Finance Bill 2018 as passed by the National Assembly is enacted into law, the pump prices shall be re-adjusted accordingly,” the ERC said in a statement. The retail price for petroleum in the capital, Nairobi, will now be quoted at 127.80 Kenyan shillings ($1.27) per litre, while diesel is priced at 115.08 shillings, the regulator said. Economic analysts said on Thursday that Kenya’s fiscal deficit was likely to be higher than projected after parliament rejected most of the tax measures proposed by the government for the 2018 budget. Kenya’s legislature also rejected a “Robin Hood” tax of 0.05 percent on bank transfers of more than 500,000 shillings ($5,000) and an employee contribution scheme towards the national housing development fund. The planned tax hikes were designed to fund a range of government development goals including universal healthcare and affordable housing. KRA said it had advised importers, depots, distributors and retailers, including roadside fuel stations, to charge, account and submit returns on a monthly basis. “KRA has instituted measures to support oil industry players in complying with the law. We have also engaged the Energy Regulatory Commission in order to ensure coordinated action by relevant government agencies,” it said.

2018-09-01,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis, who has spoken strongly for action against global warming in recent years, called on Saturday for people to work together to stop the world’s oceans filling up with plastic waste. “We cannot allow our seas and oceans to be littered by endless fields of floating plastic,” the pope said. “We need to pray as if everything depended on God’s providence, and work as if everything depended on us.” The pontiff’s comments are from a message for the fourth annual prayer day “for the protection of creation” that is celebrated with other Christian denominations.  The pope addressed about 100 business leaders invited to the Vatican for the occasion, saying that “each of us has to be responsible for others and for the future of our planet”. United Nations figures show eight million tonnes of plastic — bottles, packaging and other waste — enter the ocean each year, killing marine life and entering the human food chain. Scientists have urged tougher restrictions on plastic waste. In December, almost 200 nations agreed to limit plastic pollution of the oceans, warning it could outweigh fish by 2030. Francis wrote a major document called “Laudato Si” (Praised Be) on protecting the environment from global warming in 2015. The pope has sided with those who believe global warming is at least partly man-made and has praised scientists who are working to keep the earth’s temperature under control.

2018-09-01,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Firefighters have controlled a fire that injured 10 people at Germany’s Vohburg refinery in Bavaria state, after it erupted following a blast on Saturday morning, regional officials said. The blaze at the 120,000 barrel per day (bpd) plant, part of the Bayernoil refinery complex, prompted police to evacuate 1,800 residents from the surrounding area. Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said police in the nearby town of Ingolstadt and the Bavarian state criminal police agency had started an investigation into the blaze, which sent smoke billowing into the air. Bayernoil said on its website that the refinery had been put out of action but the installation had been secured and was no longer a safety risk. The minister said 10 people were injured and 600 police, firefighters and other members of the emergency services were on site dealing with the incident. Bayernoil refinery complex, which also includes the Neustadt refinery, has an overall capacity of 210,000 bpd. “Statements regarding the cause of the incident and the extent of damages will only be possible after investigations have been completed,” Bayernoil said.     Bayernoil is 45 percent owned by Varo Energy (CG.O)[VITOLV.UL], with Rosneft Deutschland (ROSN.MM) holding 25 percent, Eni Deutschland (ENI.MI) 20 percent and BP Europe (BP.L) 10 percent.

2018-09-01,"* Lira sell-off raises cost of food and fuel * Inflation running at 14-year high of nearly 16 percent * Erdogan rejects rate hikes, fanning investor fears (Adds impact of price hikes on inflation) By Orhan Coskun ANKARA, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Turkey raised natural gas prices on Saturday by as much as 14 percent, two sources said, while the energy regulator announced a similar increase in electricity costs as a deepening currency crisis stokes inflation. The lira has fallen 42 percent against the dollar this year, hit by concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan’s grip on monetary policy and a worsening rift with the United States over a detained American Christian pastor. The sell-off has increased the cost of food and petrol and raised fears about the impact on the country’s wider economy and banks. Economists are particularly worried about the central bank’s inability to rein in inflation, which hit a 14-year high of nearly 16 percent in July. State pipeline operator Botas raised natural gas prices by 14 percent for industrial use and 9 percent for residential use effective from Saturday, two sources told Reuters. Officials for Botas were not immediately available to comment. Last month, Botas increased the price of natural gas for electricity production by 50 percent and by 9 percent for residential use. Turkey is dependent on imports for almost all of its energy needs. The lira crisis has driven up the cost, in local currency terms, of oil and gas. Likewise, Turkey’s energy regulator said it would raise electricity prices by 14 percent for industrial use and 9 percent for households from Saturday. It increased prices by the same amount last month. Almost a third of Turkey’s total 293 billion megawatt power production came from natural gas power plants in 2017. Retail prices in Istanbul, Turkey’s biggest city, surged 2.23 percent month-on-month in August, for a year-on-year increase of 14.99 percent, the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce said on Saturday. Official August inflation data is due on Monday, and economists expect another hefty reading. “This will provide the first hard evidence of the impact of the lira’s collapse this month on the wider economy,” Jason Tuvey of Capital Economics said in a note to clients on Friday. The latest hikes in electricity and gas prices will directly increase inflation by 35 basis points, according to Reuters calculations. Erdogan, self-described “enemy of interest rates”, wants to see lower borrowing costs to keep credit flowing, particularly to the construction sector. Investors, who see the economy heading for a hard landing, say decisive interest rate hikes are needed to put the brakes on inflation. Erdogan, who has appointed his son-in-law Berat Albayrak as finance minister, casts the lira’s slide as an economic attack on Turkey by Western governments, financiers and ratings agencies. He says high interest rates cause inflation — a stance at odds with orthodox economics. “We see little chance that an ugly set of inflation figures will change the government’s — and, crucially, President Erdogan’s — stance on interest rates,” Tuvey of Capital Economics said.

2018-09-01,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will end restrictions on the sale of solar panels from China early next week in a move that EU producers said would lead to a flood of cheap imports. The European Commission, which coordinates EU trade policy, said in a statement on Friday that the measures would expire at midnight on Monday Sept. 3, confirming a Reuters report on Aug. 24. The EU first imposed anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures for Chinese solar panels, wafers and cells in 2013 and extended them by 18 months in March last year, signaling that they should then end. Chinese manufacturers have been allowed to sell solar products in Europe free of duties if they do so at or above a progressively declining minimum price. If sold for less than that price, they are subject to duties of up to 64.9 percent. The Commission said it was in the best interests of the EU as a whole for the measures to lapse, given the bloc’s aim of increasing its supply of renewable energy. The measures had also decreased over time, allowing import prices to align with world market prices, it said. China’s commerce ministry welcomed the end of restrictions, describing the move as a “model for successfully resolving trade frictions through consultations.” The move “will restore EU-China trade of photovoltaics to a normal market condition, will provide a more stable and predictable business environment for cooperation between the two sides’ industries, and will truly realize mutual benefit for both sides,” the ministry said in a statement on its website. SolarPower Europe, which represents importers and installers, described the move as a “watershed moment” for Europe’s solar industry and that it removes the biggest barrier to growth of the sector. The European Union has faced a delicate balancing act between the interests of EU manufacturers and those such as importers and installers pressing for a reduction in the cost of solar power generation. It has also been concerned about the response from Beijing, given that the two sides were on the verge of a trade war over the issue in 2013. EU ProSun, the grouping of EU producers that launched the initial complaint in 2012 and wanted a further extension of measures, had said that European manufacturers would be devastated if the measures ended. Beijing’s decision to limit installations in China meant producers there had some 30 gigawatts of excess capacity to shift but with few markets to sell into after tariffs imposed by the United States and planned by India, the second and third-largest markets behind China. The total EU market is about 7 gigawatts. Some companies were considering a legal challenge at the European Court of Justice. EU ProSun said, adding that years of falling prices had not resulted in growth of the European market.
