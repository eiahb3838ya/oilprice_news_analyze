2018-11-05,"(Recasts with Bolsonaro aide interview, his comments on TV, political context) By Anthony Boadle and Ricardo Brito BRASILIA, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Brazil’s right-wing President-elect Jair Bolsonaro said on Monday he will move to overhaul the country’s costly pension system soon after he takes office Jan. 1, to bring the government’s unsustainable budget deficit under control. Bolsonaro’s team of orthodox economists wants to resolve the budget deficit as soon as possible to get investment flowing again and spur economic growth and new jobs in an economy just emerging from its worst recession. But he will also have to launch a public safety plan to crack down on violent crime and advance other conservative measures expected by his voters, said Bia Kicis, a close Bolsonaro aide who was elected to Congress. She said that includes giving police more powers to fire on armed criminals, easing gun controls, reducing to 16 from 18 the age at which young people can be criminally prosecuted and enacting legislation that make land invasions acts of terrorism. A bill to remove politics and teaching of sexual diversity in schools is another priority for the Christian voters who helped get Bolsonaro elected, she said. “This agenda cannot be delayed because Bolsonaro was voted in for these reasons,” Kicis, a retired Federal District prosecutor, said in an interview. Bolsonaro’s future economy minister, University of Chicago-trained economist Paulo Guedes, would like to see part of the pension reform proposal already in Congress passed before Bolsonaro takes office to relieve pressure and save political capital. “If we cannot get anything approved this year, we will do some kind of reform at the beginning of next year,” Bolsonaro said in an interview with TV Band. He said his plan is to cut taxes in a responsible way and ruled out reviving a despised tax on transactions known as the CPMF to raise fiscal revenues. Bolsonaro’s political advisers, including Kicis, worry that a focus on unavoidable and unpopular austerity policies will dash the expectations of his supporters. Kicis, who is urging a “mixed” agenda that will keep voters happy, aims to become chair of the Constitutional and Legal Affairs committee that is key to passing legislation in the lower chamber. Bolsonaro’s party rose from nowhere to gain 52 seats in the lower chamber, four short of the leftist Workers Party. Kicis said she expects Bolsonaro’s PSL party to become the largest in Congress with more than a dozen lawmakers joining from other small parties. It should enjoy a safe majority with the backing of the farm, evangelical and pro-gun caucuses that supported the former army captain’s candidacy, she said.

2018-11-05,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - North American farmers are finding increased levels of a plant toxin known as vomitoxin in this year’s corn harvest, adding insult to injury for growers already suffering as the U.S.-China trade war hurts soybean exports and crop prices. Vomitoxin sickens livestock and can also make humans and pets fall ill, and grain buyers can reject cargoes or fine farmers for shipments that contain it.  More cases than normal are likely in the corn crop because wet weather this autumn caused the fungus to develop while delaying harvests, Iowa State University grain quality expert Charles Hurburgh said on Monday.    About three-fourths of U.S. corn is used domestically to feed livestock and make ethanol and a byproduct called distillers’ dried grains that is fed to animals. However, livestock and ethanol producers need to blend corn that contains vomitoxin with corn that does not to make it suitable for feed when toxin levels are high. “Hogs don’t like the taste and don’t like the smell. They will literally starve to death before eating it,” said Indiana grain inspector Doug Titus of Titus Grain Inspection, whose company has labs at Andersons Inc, a crop handler, and energy company Valero Energy Corp sites. The quality worries come as U.S. farm income has plunged by half over the past five years and as the deepening trade war harms demand for soybeans, the most valuable U.S. agricultural export product to China, and one frequently rotated with corn. WH Group Ltd’s Smithfield Foods Inc [SFII.UL], the world’s biggest pork producer, has detected vomitoxin in corn in Iowa and Nebraska, where it is not normally a problem, a source with knowledge of the situation said. The company, which feeds corn to hogs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration allows vomitoxin levels of up to one part per million (ppm) in human and pet foods and recommends levels under five ppm in grain for hogs, 10 ppm for chickens and dairy cattle. Beef cattle can withstand toxin levels up to 30 ppm. Ohio-based Andersons is warning farmers delivering corn to an ethanol plant in Albion, Michigan, that corn with vomitoxin levels above five ppm is subject to rejection. Ethanol plants in Michigan and Ohio are also testing corn deliveries for the toxin and charging farmers financial penalties if their loads contain too much, a grain dealer in Michigan said. In upstate New York, farmers are feeding dairy cattle with millfeeds, a byproduct of wheat flour milling, instead of contaminated corn, according to a feed broker in upstate New York. Prices for millfeeds rose about $5 per ton to $100 per ton for trucks in Buffalo, New York, on Monday. Problems stretched over the border into Canada, too.  “I’m already getting the panic button pushed in Canada in Ontario,” said Max Hawkins, a nutritionist with Alltech Inc, a Kentucky-based feed supplement company. Alltech had tested 45 samples of this year’s U.S. corn harvest as of Friday and found 80 percent contained vomitoxin, Hawkins said. That is about average, Hawkins said, but he expected further testing to reveal bigger problems.     More samples have not been examined yet because of the rains that delayed harvesting, which was 76 percent complete as of Sunday. “It’s going to get worse,” Hawkins said.

2018-11-05,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s right-wing President-elect Jair Bolsonaro said on Monday he will move to overhaul the country’s costly pension system soon after he takes office Jan. 1, to bring the government’s unsustainable budget deficit under control. Bolsonaro’s team of orthodox economists wants to resolve the budget deficit as soon as possible to get investment flowing again and spur economic growth and new jobs in an economy just emerging from its worst recession.  But he will also have to launch a public safety plan to crack down on violent crime and advance other conservative measures expected by his voters, said Bia Kicis, a close Bolsonaro aide who was elected to Congress. She said that includes giving police more powers to fire on armed criminals, easing gun controls, reducing to 16 from 18 the age at which young people can be criminally prosecuted and enacting legislation that make land invasions acts of terrorism. A bill to remove politics and teaching of sexual diversity in schools is another priority for the Christian voters who helped get Bolsonaro elected, she said. “This agenda cannot be delayed because Bolsonaro was voted in for these reasons,” Kicis, a retired Federal District  prosecutor, said in an interview. Bolsonaro’s future economy minister, University of Chicago-trained economist Paulo Guedes, would like to see part of the pension reform proposal already in Congress passed before Bolsonaro takes office to relieve pressure and save political capital. “If we cannot get anything approved this year, we will do some kind of reform at the beginning of next year,” Bolsonaro said in an interview with TV Band. He said his plan is to cut taxes in a responsible way and ruled out reviving a despised tax on transactions known as the CPMF to raise fiscal revenues. Bolsonaro’s political advisers, including Kicis, worry that a focus on unavoidable and unpopular austerity policies will dash the expectations of his supporters. Kicis, who is urging a “mixed” agenda that will keep voters happy, aims to become chair of the Constitutional and Legal Affairs committee that is key to passing legislation in the lower chamber. Bolsonaro’s party rose from nowhere to gain 52 seats in the lower chamber, four short of the leftist Workers Party. Kicis said she expects Bolsonaro’s PSL party to become the largest in Congress with more than a dozen lawmakers joining from other small parties. It should enjoy a safe majority with the backing of the farm, evangelical and pro-gun caucuses that supported the former army captain’s candidacy, she said.

2018-11-05,"(Adds comments from Abiove head, context on biodiesel blending) By Marcelo Teixeira SAO PAULO, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Brazil’s soy processing executives are in talks with Chinese government officials over ways to increase soymeal exports to the Asian nation, industry group Abiove said on Monday. China already buys around 80 percent of Brazilian soybean exports. According to official data, Brazil exported 55 million tonnes of soybeans to China from January to September, while sales of soymeal - crushed soybeans used for animal feed - were 209,000 tonnes. In a video message to participants at a biodiesel conference in Sao Paulo, Abiove’s head André Nassar said there was a need to increase exports of meal to help local crushers that are facing rising costs for soybeans. Nassar is part of a Brazilian delegation accompanying agriculture ministry officials visiting China this week to discuss bilateral trade. While Brazilian soy farmers have benefited from a trade spat between United States and China, which applied a 25-percent additional tax on U.S. soybean imports, Brazilian crushers have seen supplies of soybeans shrink and production costs rise. “It could be a win-win solution. China could diversify their imports by buying more meal from Brazil, something that in turn would help our crushers,” said Nassar in the message during the Biodieselbr 2018 conference. Brazilian soymeal exports to China face higher taxes than soybeans. Abiove said it was negotiating with Chinese government officials for a quota to ship meal to China either tax-free or with lower taxes. In coming years, soy processors are likely to see an uptick in soymeal production as a result of new biodiesel blending guidelines approved last week by the government. The share of biodiesel in diesel is expected to increase by 1 percentage point every year from 2019 to 2023, from 10 percent currently to 15 percent. That should increase demand for soyoil - which biodiesel in Brazil is mostly made from - but crushers need to find new markets for the extra soymeal created as a byproduct of the process. Brazilian soyoil exports could fall next year due to rising local demand for the oil from biodiesel producers and stable crushing capacity, Nassar said. Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira

2018-11-05,"WASHINGTON/DUBAI (Reuters) - The United States on Monday restored sanctions targeting Iran’s oil, banking and transportation sectors and threatened more action to stop its “outlaw” policies, steps the Islamic Republic called economic warfare and vowed to defy. The measures are part of a wider effort by U.S. President Donald Trump to curb Tehran’s missile and nuclear programs and diminish the Islamic Republic’s influence in the Middle East, notably its support for proxies in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon. Trump’s moves target Iran’s main source of revenue - its oil exports - as well as its financial sector, essentially making 50 Iranian banks and their subsidiaries off limits to foreign banks on pain of losing access to the U.S. financial system. The return of the sanctions was triggered by Trump’s May 8 decision to abandon the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, negotiated with five other world powers during Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration. That agreement had removed many U.S. and other economic sanctions from Iran in return for Tehran’s commitment to curtail its nuclear programme. Trump denounced the deal because of time limits on some of Iran’s nuclear activities, as well as for its failure to address other Iranian activity that the United States does not like. In abandoning the agreement and imposing sanctions that it had lifted as well as adding new ones, the United States is betting the economic pressure will force Iran to change its behaviour and agree to a new, much more restrictive deal. “The Iranian regime has a choice: it can either do a 180-degree turn from its outlaw course of action and act like a normal country, or it can see its economy crumble,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters. “We hope a new agreement with Iran is possible.” Speaking before Pompeo detailed the U.S. sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani accused the United States of targeting ordinary Iranians and said the Islamic Republic would find a way to “continue to sell our oil ... to break sanctions.” “The enemy is targeting our economy ... the main target of sanctions is our people,” he said. “This is an economic war against Iran.” Some analysts are sceptical Iran will knuckle under to U.S. pressure, at least in the short term. “The increasing pressures on Iran will not change the behaviour of the regime any time soon,” said Dennis Ross, a former U.S. official now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said U.S. “bullying” was backfiring by making Washington more isolated, a reference to other world powers opposed to the initiative. The other parties to the 2015 nuclear deal, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, have said they will stay in it. The sanctions are designed, in part, to force Iran’s main customers to stop buying its oil. However, the United States gave temporary exceptions to eight importers - China, India, Greece, Italy, Taiwan, Japan, Turkey and South Korea - allowing them to keep buying from Iran. Iraq has also been given an exemption, Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative for Iran, told reporters in a conference call, saying Iraq was working “on reducing Iran’s influence and opening Kirkuk, which would be another 200,000 barrels of oil.” In June Iran said that Baghdad and Tehran had begun exchanging crude oil. Crude from the Kirkuk field in northern Iraq is being shipped by truck to Iran. Tehran will use the oil in its refineries and will deliver the same amount of oil to Iraq’s southern ports, on the Gulf. The sanctions also cover 50 Iranian banks and subsidiaries, more than 200 persons and vessels in its shipping sector, Tehran’s national airline, Iran Air, and more than 65 of its aircraft, a U.S. Treasury statement said. The administration said it had toughened the sanctions by  roughly 300 new designations on individuals and entities, and targeted more subsidiaries of Iranian companies than before. European powers that continue to back the nuclear deal said they opposed the reapplication of sanctions and major oil buyer China said it regretted the move. Switzerland said it was holding talks with the United States and Iran about launching a humanitarian payment channel to help food and drugs keep flowing to Tehran. U.S. sanctions permit trade in humanitarian goods such as food and pharmaceuticals but measures imposed on banks and trade restrictions could make such items more expensive as well as more difficult to pay for. The United States will allow non-proliferation civil nuclear work at Arak, Bushehr and Fordow in Iran “under the strictest scrutiny,” the State Department said on Monday. The Belgium-based SWIFT financial messaging service said it is suspending some unspecified Iranian banks’ access to its messaging system in the interests of the stability and integrity of the global financial system. The head of Iran’s Central Bank, Abdolnassr Hemmati, said the country has taken necessary banking measures to continue trade after the U.S. move, Iranian state TV said. The European Union, France, Germany and Britain said they regretted the U.S. decision and would seek to protect European companies doing legitimate business with Tehran. Diplomats told Reuters last month that a new EU mechanism to facilitate payments for Iranian oil exports should be legally in place by Nov. 4 but not operational until early next year.  Trump told reporters he wanted to impose the oil sanctions slowly so as not to “cause a shock to the market.” Oil prices were mixed on Monday after a steep five-day fall.      Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose 34 cents to settle at $73.17 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell 4 cents to settle at $63.10 a barrel. Prices rallied to near four-year highs in early October on expectations the imposition of sanctions would create a global supply shortage. However, news of the waivers last week sent prices lower as top buyers would continue to import Iranian oil.

2018-11-05,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States snapped sanctions back in place on Monday to choke Iran’s oil and shipping industries, while temporarily allowing top customers such as China and India to keep buying crude from the Islamic Republic. Having abandoned a 2015 Iran nuclear deal, U.S President Donald Trump is trying to cripple Iran’s oil-dependent economy and force Tehran to quash not only its nuclear ambitions and ballistic missile program but also support for militant proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East. Earlier, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Iran would continue to sell its oil despite Washington’s “economic war.” Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said U.S. “bullying” was backfiring by making Washington more isolated. Washington has pledged to eventually halt all purchases of crude oil from Iran globally but for now it said eight countries - China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey - can continue imports without penalty. Crude exports contribute one-third of Iran’s government revenues. “More than 20 importing nations have zeroed out their imports of crude oil already, taking more than 1 million barrels of crude per day off the market,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters in a briefing. “The regime to date since May has lost over $2.5 billion in oil revenue.” Pompeo said the waivers were issued to countries that have already cut purchases of Iranian crude over the past six months, and to “ensure a well-supplied oil market.” The exceptions are designed to last 180 days. Trump said he wanted to go slow on the sanctions, citing concerns about causing global price spikes.  “I could get the Iran oil down to zero immediately but it would cause a shock to the market. I don’t want to lift oil prices,” he told reporters before flying to a campaign event. Iran’s exports peaked at 2.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, including 300,000 bpd of condensate, a lighter form of oil. Overall exports have since fallen to 1.8 million bpd, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, which expects volumes to drop to 1 million bpd. GRAPHIC: Iran's nuclear deal - tmsnrt.rs/2rvkaq6 Oil prices in October rallied above $85 per barrel on fears of a steep decline in Iranian exports. Prices have fallen since then on expectations that some buyers would receive exemptions and as supply from other big producers has increased. Ellen Wald, an oil analyst and fellow at the Atlantic Council, said the impact on global oil prices should be “blunted” for the 180-day length of the waivers to the eight countries. The Trump administration hopes more oil production will come next year from Iraq and from a so-called neutral zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, if a dispute between the two countries over the zone is resolved. In addition, U.S. oil output hit a record high this year of about 11.3 million barrels, and sustained high output could reduce the impact of sanctions. On Monday, international benchmark Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 erased earlier gains to trade at $72.85 a barrel while U.S. crude futures CLc1 fell 0.4 percent to $62.87. [O/R] Oil markets have been anticipating the sanctions for months and the world’s biggest producers have been increasing output. Joint output from the world’s top producers - Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia - in October rose above 33 million bpd for the first time, up 10 million bpd since 2010. U.S. officials have said the countries given temporary exemptions will deposit revenue in escrow accounts for Tehran to use solely for humanitarian purposes. The sanctions also cover 50 Iranian banks and subsidiaries, more than 200 people and vessels in its shipping sector, Tehran’s national airline, Iran Air, and more than 65 of its aircraft, a U.S. Treasury statement said. “We’ve said for a long time: Zero should mean zero,” John Bolton, White House National Security adviser told Fox Business Network in an interview. “These are not permanent waivers - no way, we’re going to do everything we can to squeeze Iran hard.” Additional reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in NEW YORK, Jane Chung in SEOUL, Kaori Kaneko and Osamu Tsukimori in TOKYO, Ben Blanchard in BEIJING, Nidhi Verma in NEW DELHI and Lesley Wroughton, Timothy Gardner and Roberta Rampton in WASHINGTON; Writing by Henning Gloystein and Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by David Gaffen, Bill Trott and James Dalgleish",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-iran-sanctions-oil/update-7-u-s-renews-iran-sanctions-grants-oil-waivers-to-china-seven-others-idUKL4N1XG2LY,05 Nov 2018,"* Trump says does not want a spike in oil prices

2018-11-05,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices, hearing a challenge to Virginia’s moratorium on uranium mining, struggled on Monday over how far states can go to ban mining of the radioactive metal for public health reasons before overstepping federal law.  The justices heard an hour of arguments in an appeal by a company called Virginia Uranium, Inc seeking to revive a lawsuit thrown out by a lower court that aimed to invalidate Virginia’s ban, enacted in 1982. The company has said that ban conflicts with a federal law regulating nuclear power generation. At the center of the dispute is the largest-known U.S. uranium deposit, located beneath a privately owned estate in Pittsylvania County in southern Virginia, near the North Carolina border. The company, a subsidiary of Vancouver, British Columbia-based Virginia Energy Resources (VUI.V), is seeking to exploit the deposit, valued at about $6 billion.  Uranium, a main source of fuel for nuclear power plants and material in nuclear warheads, represents a vital resource for electricity and national defense. Virginia enacted its ban on uranium mining amid concerns about environmental and public safety hazards. Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer and conservative Justice Samuel Alito signaled that courts should look to the Virginia legislators’ motives in passing the law to determine whether it regulates only mining, as Virginia argues, or tries to curb radiological hazards, a matter that must be left to the federal government.  “I think that’s our job as a court in a relevant case to determine what the purpose is,” Breyer said.  Some liberal justices, as well as conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, appeared to side with the state. Gorsuch told U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, who argued on behalf of President Donald Trump’s administration in support of the company’s position, that the U.S. Congress could have prevented states from regulating uranium mining, but did not.  “So why isn’t that the end of the case?” Gorsuch asked. Francisco responded that if the justices uphold the lower court’s decision, “it really is a roadmap for completely undermining a multibillion-dollar industry.” The company has extolled the economic benefits for Virginia, saying uranium mining could mean more than a thousand jobs annually and billions of dollars for the local economy.  It has also emphasized uranium’s critical importance in nuclear weapons and powering U.S. nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers, noting that most uranium used in the United States is imported, including from “geopolitical rivals” such as Russia.  The dispute concerns whether the federal Atomic Energy Act of 1954 preempts Virginia’s mining ban under the U.S. Constitution’s so-called Supremacy Clause, which holds that federal law generally trumps state law. The Atomic Energy Act gives the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission the sole power to regulate radiation safety standards for milling uranium ore and disposing of waste byproducts known as tailings, key steps in the production of nuclear fuel. But it does not cover conventional uranium mining on non-federal land.  Virginia has said federal law specifically allows it to ban uranium mining. It has the support of several other states concerned about protecting states’ rights, including Indiana, Texas, Massachusetts and Oregon. The plaintiffs, also including Cole Hill LLC and Bowen Minerals LLC, sued Virginia in 2015. The Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year upheld a trial judge’s ruling to toss out the lawsuit.

2018-11-05,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices were mixed on Monday after a steep five-day fall, as the United States formally imposed punitive sanctions on Iran but granted eight countries temporary waivers allowing them to keep buying oil from the Islamic Republic. The sanctions are part of U.S. President Donald Trump’s effort to curb Iran’s missile and nuclear programs and diminish its influence in the Middle East.  Oil markets have been anticipating the sanctions for months. Prices have been under pressure as major producers, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, have ramped up output to near-record levels, while weak economic figures in China have cast doubt on the demand outlook. News of waivers on the sanctions weighed on prices, analysts said. “There are a lot of questions about the sanctions, about waivers,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “There’s some doubt that the sanctions are going to have the bite the market originally thought.” Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose 34 cents to settle at $73.17 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell 4 cents to settle at $63.10 a barrel. Both oil benchmarks have slid more than 15 percent since hitting four-year highs in early October. Hedge funds have cut bullish bets on crude to a one-year low. The United States has granted exemptions to China, India, Greece, Italy, Taiwan, Japan, Turkey and South Korea, allowing them to continue buying Iranian oil temporarily, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday. Some of the countries are OPEC member Iran’s top customers. Trump on Monday said he wants to impose sanctions on Iran’s oil gradually, citing concerns about shocking energy markets and causing global price spikes. U.S. officials have said the aim of the sanctions is eventually to stop all Iran’s oil exports.  Pompeo said more than 20 countries have already cut oil imports from Iran, reducing purchases by more than 1 million barrels per day. Sanctions have already cost Iran billions of dollars in oil revenue since May, U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook told reporters on a call on Monday. Iran said on Monday it would break the sanctions and continue to sell oil abroad. China’s foreign ministry expressed regret at the U.S. move. Combined output from Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia rose above 33 million bpd for the first time in October, up 10 million bpd since 2010, with all three pumping at or near record volumes. The Abu Dhabi National Oil Co plans to boost oil production capacity to 4 million bpd by the end of 2020 and to 5 million bpd by 2030, it said on Sunday, from output of just over 3 million bpd.

We have the toughest sanctions ever imposed, but on oil we want to go a little bit slower because I don’t want to drive (up) the oil prices in the world,” he told reporters before flying to a campaign event. “This has nothing to do with Iran... I could get the Iran oil down to zero immediately but it would cause a shock to the market.

Trump’s moves target Iran’s main source of revenue, its oil exports, as well as its financial sector. “If you notice, oil prices are going down very substantially, despite the fact that already half of their capacity is gone,” Trump said, adding “it will be a gradual” imposition of oil sanctions.

2018-11-05,"WASHINGTON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices, hearing a challenge to Virginia’s moratorium on uranium mining, struggled on Monday over how far states can go to ban mining of the radioactive metal for public health reasons before overstepping federal law. The justices heard an hour of arguments in an appeal by a company called Virginia Uranium, Inc seeking to revive a lawsuit thrown out by a lower court that aimed to invalidate Virginia’s ban, enacted in 1982, because it conflicted with a federal law that regulates nuclear power generation. At the center of the dispute is the largest-known U.S. uranium deposit, located beneath a privately owned estate in Pittsylvania County in southern Virginia, near the North Carolina border. The company, a subsidiary of Vancouver, British Columbia-based Virginia Energy Resources, is seeking to exploit the deposit, valued at about $6 billion. Uranium, a main source of fuel for nuclear power plants and material in nuclear warheads, represents a vital resource for electricity and national defense. The case could clarify how far states can go in regulating access to uranium resources. Virginia enacted its ban on uranium mining amid concerns about environmental and public safety hazards. Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer and conservative Justice Samuel Alito signaled that courts should look to the Virginia legislators’ motives in passing the law to determine whether it regulates only mining, as Virginia argues, or tries to curb radiological hazards, a matter that must be left to the federal government. “I think that’s our job as a court in a relevant case to determine what the purpose is,” Breyer said. Some liberal justices, as well as conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, appeared to side with the state. Gorsuch said the U.S. Congress could have prevented states from regulating uranium mining, but did not. The company, backed by President Donald Trump’s administration, has extolled the economic benefits for Virginia, saying uranium mining could mean more than a thousand jobs annually and billions of dollars for the local economy. It has also emphasized uranium’s critical importance in nuclear weapons and powering the country’s nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers, noting that most uranium used in the United States is imported, including 40 percent from “geopolitical rivals” including Russia. The dispute concerns whether the federal Atomic Energy Act of 1954 preempts Virginia’s mining ban under the U.S. Constitution’s so-called Supremacy Clause, which holds that federal law generally trumps state law. The Atomic Energy Act gives the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission the sole power to regulate radiation safety standards for milling uranium ore and disposing of waste byproducts known as tailings, key steps in the production of nuclear fuel. But it does not cover conventional uranium mining on non-federal land. Virginia has said federal law specifically allows it to ban uranium mining. It has the support of several other states concerned about protecting states’ rights, including Indiana, Texas, Massachusetts and Oregon. The plaintiffs, also including Cole Hill LLC and Bowen Minerals LLC, sued the state in 2015. The Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year upheld a trial judge’s ruling to toss out the lawsuit.

2018-11-05,"(Adds quotes, detail) DUBAI, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Sanctions have already cost Iran billions of dollars in oil revenue since May when U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal, U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook told reporters on a call on Monday. “Our oil sanctions have taken off 1 million barrels of Iranian oil off the market, and that alone has reduced the regime’s revenues by more than $2 billion,” he said. He did not explain the figures further. At present prices, a reduction of 1 million barrels per day in Iranian exports would reduce its revenue by around $2 billion per month. The United States imposed strict sanctions on Iran’s vital energy sector on Monday, which were lifted under Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with major powers. Washington granted waivers to 8 countries. The measures are part of a wider effort by U.S. President Donald Trump to curb Tehran’s missile and nuclear programs and diminish the Islamic Republic’s influence in the Middle East. U.S. allies in Europe, which backed the 2015 agreement under which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in return for the lifting of sanctions, oppose Trump’s move. Hook said Washington did not expect restored oil sanctions against Tehran to have a negative impact on a market that is well-supplied and balanced. “Some 20 countries that imported Iranian oil prior to May have zeroed their input because of our sanctions. More than 100 major companies have withdrawn their business from Iran or canceled their planned investment, leading to tens of billions of dollars in lost investment,” Hook said. Other signatories of the nuclear deal have been trying to save the accord since Trump exited the pact. Washington reimposed first round of sanctions on Tehran In August. Hook said Washington believed that the Iranian nation had lost their confidence in their clerical rulers. “The Iranian people have had 39 years of economic mismanagement ... They know very well that their economic problems are caused by the Iranian regime and not the United States,” he said.

2018-11-05,"LONDON, Nov 5 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When the worst floods in a century swept through India’s southern Kerala state in August, they killed more than 480 people and left behind more than $5 billion in damage. But one thing survived unscathed: India’s first floating solar panels, on one of the country’s largest water reservoirs. As India grapples with wilder weather, surging demand for power and a goal to nearly quintuple the use of solar energy in just four years, “we are very much excited about floating solar,” said Shailesh K. Mishra, director of power systems at the government Solar Energy Corporation of India. India is planning new large-scale installations of the technology on hydropower reservoirs and other water bodies in Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand states, and in the Lakshadweep islands, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “The cost is coming almost to the same level as ground solar, and then it will go (forward) very fast,” he predicted. As countries move to swiftly scale up solar power, to meet growing demand for energy and to try to curb climate change, floating solar panels - installed on reservoirs or along coastal areas - are fast gaining popularity, particularly in Asia, experts say. The panels - now in place from China to the Maldives to Britain - get around some of the biggest problems facing traditional solar farms, particularly a lack of available land, said Oliver Knight, a senior energy specialist with the World Bank. “The water body is already there - you don’t need to go out and find it,” he said in a telephone interview. And siting solar arrays on water - most cover up to 10 percent of a reservoir - can cut evaporation as well, a significant benefit in water-short places, Knight said. Pakistan’s new government, for instance, is talking about using floating solar panels on water reservoirs near Karachi and Hyderabad, both to provide much-needed power and to curb water losses as climate change brings hotter temperatures and more evaporation, he said. Solar arrays on hydropower dams also can take advantage of existing power transmission lines, and excess solar can be used to pump water, effectively storing it as hydropower potential. China currently has the most of the 1.1 gigawatts of floating solar generating capacity now installed, according to the World Bank. But the technology’s potential is much bigger - about 400 gigawatts, or about as much generating capacity as all the solar photovoltaic panels installed in the world through 2017, the bank said. “If you covered 1 percent of manmade water bodies, you’re already looking at 400 gigawatts,” Knight said. “That’s very significant.” Growing use of the technology has raised fears that it could block sun into reservoirs, affecting wildlife and ecosystems, or that electrical systems might not stand up to a watery environment - particularly in salty coastal waters. But backers say that while environmental concerns need to be better studied, the relatively small amount of surface area covered by the panels - at least at the moment - doesn’t appear to create significant problems. “People worried what will happen to fish, to water quality,” said India’s Mishra. “Now all that attention has gone.” What may be more challenging is keeping panels working - and free of colonising sea creatures - in corrosively salty coastal installations, which account for a relatively small percentage of total projects so far, noted Thomas Reindl of the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore. He said he expects the technology will draw more investment “when durability and reliability has been proven in real world installations”. Currently floating solar arrays cost about 18 percent more than traditional solar photovoltaic arrays, Knight said - but that cost is often offset by other lower costs. “In many places one has to pay for land, for resettlement of people or preparing and leveling land and building roads,” he said. With floating solar, “you avoid quite a bit of that.” Solar panels used on water, which cools them, also can produce about 5 percent more electricity, he said. Mishra said that while, in his view, India has sufficient land for traditional solar installations, much of it is in remote areas inhospitable to agriculture, including deserts. Putting solar panels on water, by comparison, cuts transmission costs by moving power generation closer to the people who need the energy, he said. He said India already makes the solar panels it needs, and is now setting up manufacturing for the floats and anchors needed for floating solar systems. When that capacity is in place, “then the cost will automatically come down,” he predicted. Reporting by Laurie Goering @lauriegoering, Editing by Claire

2018-11-05,"* U.S. bond yields slip before massive supply this week * Sterling up on Brexit deal hopes * Crude up as Iran sanctions kick in (Updates prices, changes comment, dateline from previous LONDON) By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) - An index of stocks on major markets were flat on Monday, following four days of a bounce-back from a 14-month low, ahead of a key vote to define the power balance in Washington and a meeting of the U.S. monetary policy makers. Oil prices rose in choppy trading after five days of heavy losses as the United States imposed a range of punitive sanctions on Iran, aiming to curb exports by the Islamic Republic. Stocks on Wall Street were mostly up but the Nasdaq index was pressured by sharp declines in shares of Apple and Amazon. Nikkei reported Apple has told two smartphone assemblers to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to the lower-cost iPhone XR. Investors were also cautious ahead of the U.S. midterm elections. Opinion polls show a strong chance the Democratic Party could win control of the House of Representatives after two years of wielding no practical political power in Washington, with Trump’s Republican Party likely to hold the Senate. “What’s spooking the market is not Congress or Senate - what’s spooking the market is the volatility of Trump,” said Gregory Perdon, co-chief investment officer at Arbuthnot Latham. “I’m not convinced if there’s a change of control that would be able to temper that.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 140.87 points, or 0.56 percent, to 25,411.7, the S&P 500 gained 8.65 points, or 0.32 percent, to 2,731.71 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 53.73 points, or 0.73 percent, to 7,303.27. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.08 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.05 percent. Emerging market stocks lost 0.38 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.15 percent lower, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.55 percent. In crude oil markets, prices rose despite a temporary U.S. exemption granted to eight countries allowing them to continue buying Iranian oil. U.S. officials have said the aim is eventually to stop all of Iran’s oil exports. U.S. crude rose 1.01 percent to $63.78 per barrel and Brent was last at $73.79, up 1.32 percent on the day. U.S. Treasury yields fell as traders braced for $83 billion worth of government debt supply tied to the November refunding this week and awaited the outcome of the U.S. congressional elections on Tuesday. With the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, the prospect of even tighter U.S. monetary policy after strong economic data is also on investors’ minds. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 5/32 in price to yield 3.197 percent, from 3.214 percent late on Friday. The 30-year bond last rose 11/32 in price to yield 3.4344 percent, from 3.454 percent late on Friday. Sterling touched a two-week high against the U.S. dollar after a Sunday Times report that an all-UK customs deal will be written into the agreement governing Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union on hopes of a Brexit deal, before paring gains slightly. Prime Minister Theresa May’s office said the report was speculative, but that 95 percent of the withdrawal agreement was settled and negotiations were ongoing. Sterling was last trading at $1.3019, up 0.38 percent on the day. The dollar index fell 0.17 percent, with the euro up 0.14 percent to $1.1401. Market analysts warn that an unexpected outcome at the Tuesday U.S. congressional elections could undermine the greenback which has rallied more than 7 percent from April lows against its peers. “Much of Trump’s pro-growth, pro-markets agenda has arguably been enacted in the first two years of his presidency while he’s had the backing of both the House and Senate,” Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said. “If the Democrats take control of the House, for example, it may inhibit his final two years which investors may not be particularly upset about given his determination to engage in a trade war with China and the EU,” he said. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.01 percent versus the greenback at 113.20 per dollar. Spot gold dropped 0.1 percent to $1,231.26 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.03 percent to $1,232.90 an ounce.

2018-11-05,"LONDON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Golar LNG said on Monday it was in talks with Nigerian authorities about setting up a power project that could use one of its vessels to import liquefied natural gas (LNG). The company wants to expand beyond its core LNG shipping and terminals business and owns half of the $1.7 billion Sergipe power plant project in Brazil, in which it will also provide a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) to take delivery of LNG. Golar’s Chief Commercial Officer Robert Carter said the company was looking into a “fully integrated gas and power project” in the state of Lagos. “We’re in discussions with Nigerian authorities. We’re trying to develop a terminal there that could include the utilisation of domestic LNG supplies,” Carter told Reuters after local media reported the potential talks. LNG-to-power projects tend to comprise an LNG import terminal such as an FSRU vessel; infrastructure such as pipelines for the regasified gas; and a power plant which uses the gas as feedstock to produce electricity. Nigeria is a massive oil and gas producer, with a large LNG export terminal, but still needs to import fuels for vehicles and suffers power shortages due to poor infrastructure and chaotic governance of its energy sector. Golar has a fleet of 16 LNG carriers and eight FSRUs but has said it plans to expand into the broader LNG business by operating production facilities at the upstream end and participating in power projects at the downstream end. “We don’t invest in a project where there isn’t a Golar flag, so to speak,” Carter said when asked whether Golar would provide an FSRU for the Nigerian project. “We’re talking about a Golar solution.” On the Sergipe project, Golar owns 50 percent of the company operating a 1,500 megawatt power plant and associated infrastructure and will provide an FSRU. It said on Monday the project is on track to start operations in January 2020. All of Golar’s FSRUs, which can also be used as conventional LNG carriers, are currently in use aside from the Golar Tundra which is being used in the spot LNG market.

2018-11-05,"PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said he would not back down from a hike in fuel tax, despite plans for nationwide protests this month and his personal popularity reaching a new low. Drivers are planning blockades and go-slows across France on Nov. 17 to protest against higher fuel prices, which have increased by up to a third in the past year, making Macron’s claim to help hard-working people harder to defend. In a bid to fight climate change, his government has voted increases in a carbon tax and decided in particular to ramp up the price of diesel, the most commonly used car fuel in France. But the increases, decided in late 2017 at a time crude oil prices were hovering under $50 per barrel, have become more painful for consumers after oil surged to over $85 last month. The issue has helped drive Macron’s popularity to as low as 21 percent in a poll published last week. The president, who has launched a seven-day tour of northeastern France, said he has no plan to back down. “I prefer taxing fuel to taxing labour. People complaining about rising fuel prices are the same ones who complain about pollution and how their children suffer,” he told regional newspapers in the area, in an interview published on Monday. Macron’s political rivals have seized on the anger to paint the former investment banker as a member of the metropolitan elite who does not relate to those outside Paris. “You have to be completely out of touch with reality not to understand that taxing fuel is taxing those French who work,” conservative opposition leader Laurent Wauquiez said on Twitter. The protests, which according to an Odoxa poll are supported by 78 percent of the French, come at a time Macron is seeking to regain the initiative after a political scandal over the summer and a series of cabinet resignations. His tour of the northeast, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One, gives the 40-year-old leader a chance to reconnect with de-industrialising areas that are among the poorest and most isolated in France. Sensing a business opportunity from the political tumult over fuel taxes, France’s top two hypermarket chains Leclerc and Carrefour announced promotions to sell petrol at cost. Carrefour said on Monday that its special offer on petrol prices would run until Nov. 17, the date of the planned blockades. Leclerc’s will run until the end of the month.

The SWIFT statement said suspending the Iranian banks access to the messaging system was a “regrettable” step but was “taken in the interest of the stability and integrity of the wider global financial system.” Having abandoned the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, Trump is trying to cripple Iran’s oil-dependent economy and force Tehran to quash not only its nuclear ambitions and its ballistic missile program but its support for militant proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East. SWIFT’s decision not to mention the resumption of U.S. sanctions likely reflects the fact that it is caught between two contrary regulatory demands. The U.S. government has told SWIFT that it is expected to comply with U.S. sanctions and it could face U.S. sanctions if it fails to do so. On the other hand, SWIFT is barred from doing so under the European Union’s so-called blocking statute, which could subject it to European penalties for complying with U.S. law.

The move is part of a wider effort by U.S. President Donald Trump to curb Tehran’s missile and nuclear programmes and diminish the Islamic Republic’s influence in the Middle East. It follows Washington’s withdrawl from an 2015 international agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme. In a statement, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said: “Treasury’s imposition of unprecedented financial pressure on Iran should make clear to the Iranian regime that they will face mounting financial isolation and economic stagnation until they fundamentally change their destabilizing behavior.” The sanctions cover 50 Iranian banks and subsidiaries, more than 200 persons and vessels in its shipping sector, and targets Tehran’s national airline, Iran Air, and more than 65 of its aircraft, the statement said. Hours earlier, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the “bullying” restoration of oil and banking curbs was backfiring by making Washington more isolated, a reference to other world powers opposed to the initiative. European powers which continue to back the nuclear deal said they opposed the reapplication of sanctions and major oil buyer China said it regretted the move. The move is part of a wider effort by Trump to force Iran to further limit its nuclear work and halt a missile program, as well as end its support for proxy forces in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East. Switzerland said it was holding talks with the United States and Iran about launching a humanitarian payment channel to help food and drugs keep flowing to Tehran. U.S. sanctions permit trade in humanitarian goods such as food and pharmaceuticals, but measures imposed on banks and trade restrictions could make such items more expensive. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday the penalties returning on Monday were “the toughest sanctions ever put in place on the Islamic Republic of Iran”. However, Iran’s clerical rulers have dismissed concerns about the impact of sanctions on the economy. “Today the enemy (the United States) is targeting our economy...the main target of sanctions is our people,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said. “America wanted to cut to zero Iran’s oil sales...but we will continue to sell our oil...to break sanctions,” Rouhani told economists, adding the sanctions were illegal and unfair. “This is an economic war against Iran but... America should learn that it cannot use the language of force against Iran ... We are prepared to resist any pressure,” Rouhani said. Foreign minister Zarif said Washington had made itself more isolated by pursuing the sanctions. “US bullying is backfiring... The US — and not Iran — is isolated,” Zarif said in a tweet. Trump announced in May his government was withdrawing from what he called the “worst ever” agreement negotiated by the United States. The other parties to the deal - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - say they will not leave. The deal had seen most international financial and economic sanctions on Iran lifted in return for Tehran curbing its disputed nuclear activity under U.N. surveillance. Details of the sanctions will be released at a news conference scheduled for 8:30 a.m. EST (1330 GMT) with Pompeo and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The European Union, France, Germany and Britain said they regretted the U.S. decision and would seek to protect European companies doing legitimate business with Tehran. Diplomats told Reuters last month that a new EU mechanism to facilitate payments for Iranian oil exports should be legally in place by Nov. 4 but not operational until early next year. “We continue to believe that the Iran nuclear deal makes the world a safer place,” British Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman said. As long as Iran met its obligations under the deal, Britain would be committed to it too. In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed what he called Trump’s courageous decision in reimposing the sanctions on Iran, an arch-foe of Israel. China, India, South Korea, Japan and Turkey - all top importers of Iranian oil - are among eight countries expected to be given temporary exemptions from the sanctions to ensure crude oil prices are not destabilised. The countries will deposit Iran’s revenue in an escrow account and the funds will be used for humanitarian purposes, according to US officials. News of the waivers initially helped lower oil prices early on Monday, since they allow major buyers to import Iran’s oil for a while. But Brent crude was steady at $72.83 by 1230 GMT. U.S. light crude was 15 cents lower at $62.99. Rouhani said even without the waivers Iran would still be able to sell its oil, semi-official Tasnim news agency reported. The curbs come as the United States is focused on U.S. congressional and gubernatorial elections on Tuesday. Campaigning in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on Sunday, Trump said his “maximum pressure” against Iran was working. “Iran is a much different country than it was when I took office,” said Trump, adding: “They wanted to take over the whole Middle East. Right now they just want to survive.” To keep the deal alive, the remaining parties to the Iran accord are trying to maintain trade with Tehran, despite scepticism that this is possible.

European shares managed to reverse losses in choppy trade as investors readied for U.S. congressional midterm elections on Tuesday, while sterling briefly climbed on a newspaper report that a Brexit agreement was imminent. U.S. stock futures fell into the red, though, indicating a weaker start for Wall Street with S&P 500 futures down 0.1 percent and Nasdaq futures down 0.3 percent. MSCI’s all-country world index lost 0.2 percent as investors remained cautious. “Everyone’s on hold until the (end-November) G20 and also the Fed coming up,” said Gregory Perdon, co-chief investment officer at Arbuthnot Latham. “Our sense is absolutely that there’s a lot of cash on the sidelines right now.” Chinese blue-chips fell overnight after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow denied Washington has drafted a trade agreement with Beijing. But investors looked to signs of support from Chinese stimulus to withstand higher trade tariffs. President Xi Jinping promised to lower import tariffs and continue to broaden market access. “The market hasn’t been paying as close attention as they might normally because they’ve been a bit distracted by the spectre of a trade war. But the policy response out of China has been massive,” said Perdon. Emerging stocks tumbled 0.8 percent. With the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, the prospect of even tighter U.S. monetary policy after strong economic data is also on investors’ minds. Markets are now pricing in a higher probability of a December rate hike with further tightening to 2.75-3.00 percent seen through 2019. Tighter monetary policy, a stronger dollar, and trade tariffs have created what Citi strategists call “Trump’s triple tightening” this year. “This ... has slowed growth and raised risks around the world,” they wrote. Investors were also cautious ahead of the U.S. midterm elections. Opinion polls show a strong chance the Democratic Party could win control of the House of Representatives after two years of wielding no practical political power in Washington, with Trump’s Republican Party likely to hold the Senate. “What’s spooking the market is not Congress or Senate - what’s spooking the market is the volatility of Trump,” said Perdon. “I’m not convinced if there’s a change of control that would be able to temper that.” Sterling briefly jumped to a two-week high on hopes of a Brexit deal, before paring gains to trade up 0.1 percent at $1.2986. A Sunday Times report that an all-UK customs deal will be written into the agreement governing Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union drove the pound to $1.3062, its highest since Oct. 22. May’s office said the report was speculative, but that 95 percent of the withdrawal agreement was settled and negotiations were ongoing. The dollar index that measures it against a basket of major currencies was up 0.12 percent while the euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.1365. Core euro zone bond yields fell as expectations of faster U.S. rate hikes, doubts over Sino-U.S. trade talks and the mid-term elections prompted more defensive positioning. Italian bond yields rose, however, driving bank stocks down 1.4 percent. Italy’s FTSE MIB was Europe’s worst-performing index as Goldman Sachs analysts predicted more cuts to earnings forecasts for Italian lenders, cutting BPER Banca and Intesa Sanpaolo to “sell”. Oil prices steadied as the reimposition of U.S. sanctions against Iran’s fuel exports was softened by waivers that will allow some countries to continue to import Iranian crude, at least temporarily. Brent crude was unchanged at $72.83 a barrel. Overall the recent drop in share prices has not been reflected in falling earnings expectations, and some expect stocks to pick up again once key political risks are out the way.

2018-11-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers were net sellers of petroleum-linked futures and options for a fifth week running last week as concerns about sanctions on Iran evaporated and investors refocused on economic worries. The net long position in the six most important petroleum-linked futures and options contracts was cut by a further 73 million barrels in the week to Oct. 30. Portfolio managers have been net sellers of 371 million barrels since the end of September, taking their net long position to the lowest level for 15 months, according to records published by regulators and exchanges. The sharpest sell-offs last week were in Brent (-54 million barrels) and U.S. gasoline (-11 million) with smaller reductions in NYMEX and ICE WTI (-2 million), U.S. heating oil (-4 million) and European gasoil (-2 million). Position changes are no longer confined to long liquidation. Fund managers have started to establish short positions betting on further price falls. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2P8LQ1S) Short positions across all six contracts have doubled over the past five weeks to 192 million barrels, the highest level for more than 10 months. Fund managers still favour bullish long positions over bearish short ones by a ratio of almost 5:1, but the ratio has sunk from more than 12:1 only five weeks ago. The hedge fund community’s bullish bias is the lowest for a year and positioning now looks far less stretched than it did a month ago. With hedge fund positions concentrated in near-dated futures and options contracts, the sell-off has hit the front-end of the curve especially hard and accelerated the shift from backwardation to level or contango. Fears about oil supplies after the return of U.S. sanctions against Iran have been replaced by concerns about slower oil demand growth in 2019. Strong output growth from U.S. shale producers as well as Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait should be enough to compensate for the loss of Iranian exports. The U.S. government has also taken a more flexible approach to sanctions, backing away from earlier threats to cut Iranian exports to zero and granting waivers to many of Iran’s customers in exchange for phased reductions. At the same time, there are growing fears about a possible deceleration in consumption growth, with oil prices falling in tandem with equity markets against the backdrop of a darkening economic outlook.

2018-11-05,"PARIS, Nov 5 (Reuters) - French utility EDF has extended the outage at its 580 megawatts (MW) Havre 4 coal-fired power plant by another 24 hours until Tuesday Nov. 6 due to an ongoing strike, said grid operator RTE. Electricity generation at the unit has been suspended since Oct. 27. The strike, which started in protest against a French government plan to shut down power generation from coal, was initially expected to end on Sunday. RTE said the unit was expected to restart on Tuesday. EDF warned on Oct. 17 that protests could hit its coal power plants in France until the end of June 2019, due to a legislative process that would lead to the adoption of France’s long-term energy policy. France, which depends on nuclear power for over 75 percent of its electricity needs, has shut down most of its coal power plants. Only five units with an installed capacity of around 3,000 MW are currently operational. President Emmanuel Macron has promised to shut down the remaining coal power plants by the end of 2021 to respect climate change obligations. The long-term energy policy known as PPE, expected to be unveiled at the end of the month, could lay out a time frame for the closure of the remaining coal generation units.

Reiterating Iran’s position that the Trump administration is not a trustworthy partner for talks, Rouhani said: “Holding talks is not an issue for us - only if the other party respects its commitments and promises.” Trump announced in May his government was withdrawing from what he called the “worst ever” agreement negotiated by the United States. The other parties to the deal - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - say they will not leave. The deal had seen most international financial and economic sanctions on Iran lifted in return for Tehran curbing its disputed nuclear activity under U.N. surveillance. Details of the sanctions will be released at a news conference scheduled for 8:30 a.m. EST (1330 GMT) with Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The European Union, France, Germany and Britain said in a joint statement that they regretted the U.S. decision and would seek to protect European companies doing legitimate business with Tehran. China, India, South Korea, Japan and Turkey - all top importers of Iranian oil - are among eight countries expected to be given temporary exemptions from the sanctions to ensure crude oil prices are not destabilised. The countries will deposit Iran’s revenue in an escrow account, U.S. officials have said. News of the waivers helped lower oil prices early on Monday, since they allow major buyers to import Iran’s oil for a while. Brent crude was down 15 cents a barrel at $72.68 by 1030 GMT. U.S. light crude CLc1 was 30 cents lower at $62.84. Rouhani said even without the waivers Iran would still be able to sell its oil, semi-official Tasnim news agency reported. The Iranian military launched two days of air defence drills on Monday across northern Iran, and state TV aired footage of surface-to-air missiles and air defence systems. Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards Corps are among the forces participating. The curbs come as the United States is focused on U.S. congressional and gubernatorial elections on Tuesday. Campaigning in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on Sunday, Trump said his “maximum pressure” against Iran was working. “Iran is a much different country than it was when I took office,” said Trump, adding: “They wanted to take over the whole Middle East. Right now they just want to survive.” To keep the deal alive, the remaining parties to the Iran accord are trying to maintain trade with Tehran, despite scepticism that this is possible. Diplomats told Reuters last month that a new EU mechanism to facilitate payments for Iranian oil exports should be legally in place by Nov. 4 but not operational until early next year. They cautioned, however, that no country had volunteered to host the entity, which was delaying the process.

Brent crude oil was down 15 cents a barrel at $72.68 by 1030 GMT. U.S. light crude was 30 cents lower at $62.84 a barrel. Both oil price benchmarks have lost more than 15 percent since hitting four-year highs in early October, as hedge funds have cut bullish bets on crude to a one-year low, data show. Washington imposed sanctions against Iran on Monday, restoring measures lifted under a 2015 nuclear deal negotiated by the administration of former U.S. president Barack Obama, and adding 300 new designations including Iran’s oil, shipping, insurance and banking sectors. In response, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech broadcast on state TV that Iran would break the sanctions and continue to sell oil. Washington has granted some exemptions. The United States said on Friday it will temporarily allow eight importers to keep buying Iranian oil. “U.S. sanctions against Iran ... created serious concerns with traders earlier in September. But they are turning into a damp squib,” said Fiona Cincotta, market analyst at City Index. Washington has so far not identified the eight. China, India, South Korea, Turkey, Italy, the United Arab Emirates and Japan have been the top importers of Iran’s oil, while Taiwan also occasionally buys Iranian crude. South Korea said on Monday it had been granted a waiver, at least temporarily, to import condensate, a super-light form of crude oil, from Iran. It was also allowed to continue financial transactions with the Middle East country, it said. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying expressed regret at the U.S. decision, but would not directly say if China had or had not been granted an exemption. Oil markets have been anticipating the sanctions for months and the world’s biggest producers have been increasing output. Joint output from the world’s top producers - Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia - in October rose above 33 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first time, up 10 million bpd since 2010. In the Middle East, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co plans to increase its oil production capacity to 4 million bpd by the end of 2020 and to 5 million bpd by 2030, it said on Sunday, from output of just over 3 million bpd.

2018-11-05,"CAPE TOWN, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s state oil firm NNPC could sign crude-for-product deals with Shell and ExxonMobil, similar to one signed with BP last week, a senior NNPC official said on Monday. Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) announced last Wednesday that it had signed such a deal with BP and would provide more details later. “Unfortunately, Shell and ExxonMobil exited the downstream sector in Nigeria a couple of years ago but they are coming back for this particular arrangement, because it’s an opportunity for them to get crude and sell their products to the refineries,” NNPC’s chief operating officer for upstream, Bello Rabiu, told Reuters on the sidelines of an African oil and gas conference in Cape Town. NNPC imports about 70 percent of Nigeria’s fuel needs, mainly gasoline, via swap contracts. NNPC has contracts, known as direct sale direct purchase agreements, with 10 consortiums that include trading houses Vitol, Trafigura , Mercuria and Total. It extended the existing contracts to June 2019 but several trading sources in the consortiums said they had requested new price terms. Rabiu said NNPC hoped in 2019 to emulate savings of around $1 billion seen in 2016 with its crude-for-product swaps, which he said would likely end once Africa’s top crude producer revamps its refineries. “If our refineries are back, which we want in the next 18 months, this thing will stop. So, all these things are just stop-gap measures, but the key issue is that we wanted to import at the least cost before our refineries come back onstream,” he said. NNPC is in the final stages of talks with consortiums including top traders, energy majors and oil services companies to revamp its long-neglected oil refineries in an effort to reduce its reliance on imported fuel. “It is on track and I believe if we don’t sign a final deal (on the project to upgrade refineries) this month of November we will surely sign in December,” Rabiu said.

2018-11-05,"(Adds details and background) By Michael Shields ZURICH, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Switzerland is holding talks with the United States and Iran about launching a humanitarian payment channel to help ensure food and drugs keep flowing to the Islamic Republic amid tightened U.S. sanctions, the government said. Restored U.S. sanctions are part of a wider effort by U.S. President Donald Trump to force Iran to curb its nuclear and missile programmes as well as its support for proxy forces in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East. Iran has taken a defiant line. It will sell its oil and break U.S. sanctions on its vital energy and banking sectors, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said. “Switzerland is committed to safeguarding Swiss economic interests and closely follows the development of the situation. The authorities are in direct contact with the competent authorities of the United States, the EU and Iran,” the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) said in an emailed statement on Monday. “Particularly in the humanitarian field, the federal government is committed to ensuring that food and pharmaceutical products can continue to be supplied from Switzerland,” it said, adding it was in touch with U.S. authorities, Iran and unnamed Swiss companies on developing a humanitarian payment channel. A SECO spokesman would not elaborate on the plan. Switzerland, which represents U.S. diplomatic interests in Iran, was not involved in separate European Union discussions on setting up a special purpose vehicle to continue trade with Iran, but was following the talks closely, SECO said. The Swiss were also not involved in developing alternative mechanisms to SWIFT in the area of ​​secure messaging and payment transactions. Switzerland in August encouraged Swiss companies to pursue business ties with Iran prudently and expressed regret at the poor sanctions situation. Swiss-based Nestle, the world’s biggest food company which produces infant formula and cereals as well as bottled water in Iran, said in August it saw no direct fallout from renewed U.S. sanctions on the country. But Swiss lender Banque de Commerce et de Placements (BCP) in May suspended new transactions with Iran and started winding down Iran-related business. Founded in 1963, BCP had been among the players active in Iran-related trade finance in commodities, finance sources say. Overall Swiss exports to Iran rose 7.6 percent in 2017 to 536 million Swiss francs ($534 million) while imports rose 300 percent to 85 million francs. In the first nine months of this year, exports fell to 311.2 million while imports hit 17.2 million, provisional trade data show. $1 = 1.0046 Swiss francs

2018-11-05,"* World stocks fall after four-day rally * Italy leads Europe down as banks slide * Crude slides as waivers dilute Iran sanctions * Investors cautious before U.S. midterms * Sterling jumps on Brexit deal hopes By Helen Reid LONDON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - World stocks slipped on Monday, halting a four-day recovery rally as anxiety surrounding global trade conditions and rising U.S. interest rates dampened risk appetite. European shares followed Asia lower as investors readied for U.S. congressional midterm elections on Tuesday, while sterling briefly climbed on a newspaper report that a Brexit agreement was imminent. Oil prices fell as the reimposition of U.S. sanctions against Iran’s fuel exports was softened by waivers that will allow some countries to still import Iranian crude, at least temporarily. U.S. stock futures were down 0.3 percent amid concerns a trade deal between the United States and China may not be struck soon. “After a four-day rally people tend to become a bit exhausted - and just generally I feel like everyone’s on hold until the (end-November) G20 and also the Fed coming up,” said Gregory Perdon, chief investment officer at Arbuthnot Latham. “Our sense is absolutely that there’s a lot of cash on the sidelines right now.” Overnight, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 1.2 percent, slipping back towards last week’s 18-month trough. Chinese blue-chips fell after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow denied Washington has drafted a trade agreement with Beijing. President Xi Jinping acknowledged conditions abroad had created some challenges for the Chinese economy, but promised to lower import tariffs and continue to broaden market access. “The market hasn’t been paying as close attention as they might normally because they’ve been a bit distracted by the spectre of a trade war. But the policy response out of China has been massive,” said Arbuthnot Latham’s Perdon. Emerging stocks tumbled 0.9 percent. With the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, the prospect of even tighter U.S. monetary policy after strong economic data is also on investors’ minds. Markets are now pricing in a higher probability of a December rate hike with further tightening to 2.75-3.00 percent seen through 2019. Tighter monetary policy, a stronger dollar, and trade tariffs have created what Citi strategists call “Trump’s triple tightening” this year. “This ...has slowed growth and raised risks around the world,” they wrote. Investors were also cautious ahead of the U.S. midterm elections. Opinion polls show a strong chance the Democratic Party could win control of the House of Representatives after two years of wielding no practical political power in Washington, with Trump’s Republican Party likely to hold the Senate. “What’s spooking the market is not Congress or Senate - what’s spooking the market is the volatility of Trump,” said Perdon. “I’m not convinced if there’s a change of control that would be able to temper that.” Sterling briefly jumped to a two-week high on hopes of a Brexit deal, before paring gains to trade up 0.2 percent at $1.2990. A Sunday Times report that an all-UK customs deal will be written into the agreement governing Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union drove the pound to $1.3062, its highest since Oct. 22. May’s office said the report was speculative, but that 95 percent of the withdrawal agreement was settled and negotiations were ongoing. The dollar index that measures it against a basket of major currencies was little changed. The euro held flat at $1.1389. Core euro zone bond yields fell as expectations of faster U.S. rate hikes, doubts over Sino-U.S. trade talks and the mid-term elections prompted more defensive positioning. Italian bond yields rose, however, driving bank stocks down 1.8 percent. Italy’s FTSE MIB was Europe’s worst-performing index as Goldman Sachs analysts predicted more cuts to earnings forecasts for Italian lenders, cutting BPER Banca and Intesa Sanpaolo to “sell”. U.S. crude fell 0.3 percent and Brent was down 0.2 percent.

The U.S. move restores sanctions lifted under a 2015 nuclear deal negotiated by the administration of President Barack Obama and five other world powers. It adds 300 new designations in Iran’s oil, shipping, insurance and banking sectors. The European Union, which continues to back the nuclear deal, said it opposed the reimposition of sanctions and big oil buyer China said it regretted the move. The restoration of sanctions is part of a wider effort by U.S. President Donald Trump to force Iran to curb its nuclear and missile programs as well as its support for proxy forces in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday the penalties set to return on Monday “are the toughest sanctions ever put in place on the Islamic Republic of Iran.” However, Iran’s clerical rulers have dismissed concerns about the impact of sanctions on the economy. “Today the enemy (the United States) is targeting our economy...the main target of sanctions is our people,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said. “America wanted to cut to zero Iran’s oil sales...but we will continue to sell our oil...to break sanctions,” Rouhani told economists at a meeting broadcast live on state television. The sanctions were illegal and unfair, he said. “This is an economic war against Iran but ... America should learn that it cannot use the language of force against Iran ...

2018-11-05,"* Autumn session of Canton Fair ran from Oct. 15-Nov. 4 * Chinese export orders to U.S, Australia, Canada fell * Exhibitors pessimistic as U.S.-China trade row worsens (Adds quotes of exporters, AmCham, statement; paragraphs 3,5-7,10) BEIJING/DONGGUAN, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The value of export orders to the United States signed at China’s largest trade fair dropped 30.3 percent on the year, its organiser said, as higher U.S. import tariffs made goods from batteries to farm tractors costlier. The steep fall in business with China’s biggest trading partner at the twice-a-year Canton fair, which ended on Sunday, points to growing headwinds for exports, a key growth driver. Fair exhibitors said they were pessimistic about next year’s export outlook as the costs of raw material and labour rise, in addition to growing impact of trade friction with the United States, the China Foreign Trade Centre (CFTC) said. The United States has levied additional tariffs of 10 percent to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese goods this year, as punishment for what it calls the country’s unfair trade practices, with the 10 percent tariffs set to rise to 25 percent at year end. “The overall impact on our battery industry will gradually show from next year on,” Bill Ho, sales manager at BetterPower Battery Co in Shenzhen, told Reuters at the fair. The company is considering expanding its export market beyond the United States to include the Middle East and other parts of Asia, Ho added. Abell Lu, general manager at Motoma, a Chinese lithium battery producer that sells more than half its products to U.S. smartphone makers, said he was “extremely worried”. U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are expected to meet on the sidelines of the Group of 20 leaders summit in Argentina at the end of November. If their meeting does not yield any progress in resolving the dispute, Trump can be expected to hand out more tariffs, further hitting China’s already tattered export outlook. “We’ve seen with the Trump administration so far that things can just switch overnight and that can make it very difficult to plan,” said Tara Joseph, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. By industry, export orders in textiles and household appliances fell 13 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively, the CFTC statement said in its statement. Overall export deals at China’s biggest trade fair fell 1 percent to 206.5 billion yuan ($29.86 billion). Export orders to Australia and Canada fell 8.9 percent and 7.3 percent, respectively, at the fair held in the southern province of Guangdong. Outbound orders to Japan, ASEAN nations, BRICS and South Korea rose on the year, with Japan leading the increase, with a jump of 74.4 percent.

Opinion polls show a strong chance that the Democratic Party could win control of the House of Representatives after two years of wielding no practical political power in Washington, with President Donald Trump’s Republican Party likely to hold the Senate. Spreadbetters point to a subdued start for Europe with both London’s FTSE and Germany Dax seen opening lower. U.S. stock futures slipped 0.3 percent  after Wall Street closed lower on Friday amid concerns a trade deal between the United States and China may not be struck soon. “We expect U.S.-China trade tensions to get worse before they get better,” Citi analysts said in a note. “Although trade growth has held steady, concerns are rising in business surveys,” they added. “Equity markets do not seem to be fully incorporating the risks of an escalation of tensions yet, which could have an effect on investment, sentiment, inflation, and growth.” MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 1.4 percent on Monday, slipping back towards last week’s 1-1/2 year trough of 505.61 points. Japan’s Nikkei stumbled 1.6 percent while South Korea’s KOSPI index fell 1.4 percent. Chinese shares opened in the red with blue-chip stocks off 1.2 percent as President Xi Jinping acknowledged conditions abroad had created some challenges for the Chinese economy. Xi, however, promised to lower import tariffs and continue to broaden market access. Also clouding the outlook for world shares is the prospect of even tighter monetary policy in the United States, given robust economic data in recent months. The United States reported solid jobs growth for October, with annual wage gains at 9-1/2-year highs, further boosting expectations for a December rate rise. A similarly upbeat number back in February had sent global financial markets in a tailspin with a massive sell-off in bonds and equities, particularly in emerging markets, and a strong rally in the U.S. dollar. Markets are now pricing in a higher probability of a December rate hike with further tightening to 2.75-3.00 percent seen through 2019. “The U.S. employment report supports our view that the Federal Reserve will raise rates three more times from now until mid-2019,” Capital Economics said in a note. “After that, we suspect that the cumulative effect of monetary policy tightening will start taking a toll on the US economy, forcing the Fed to end its tightening cycle and pulling Treasury yields, the US stock market, and the dollar down.” Sterling briefly jumped to a two-week high on Monday on growing hopes of a smooth Brexit. With just five months to go until Britain exits the European Union divorce talks are at an impasse, a Sunday Times report that an all-UK customs deal will be written into the agreement governing Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union was enough to send the pound to $1.3062, its highest since Oct. 22. May’s office said the Sunday Times report was speculative, but added that 95 percent of the withdrawal agreement was settled and negotiations were ongoing. The pound pared gains to be last up 0.1 percent at $1.2989 after UK’s Telegraph newspaper reported significant hurdles still remain in the Brexit negotiation process. The U.S. dollar struggled on Friday. The dollar index , which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was last off 0.1 percent at 96.459. Against the safe haven yen, the dollar held at 113.25 . The euro was flat at $1.1389. In commodities, oil prices fell as the start to U.S. sanctions against Iran’s fuel exports was softened by waivers that will allow some countries to still import Iranian crude, at least temporarily.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said new car registrations in October were 2.9 percent lower compared with a year earlier at 153,599 vehicles, a sharp improvement on the annual decline of 20.5 percent in September. However, looking at the 10 months to the end of October, sales were 7.2 percent lower than for the same period of 2017 at 2.064 million, only a modest improvement on the 7.5 percent annual decline recorded up to the end of September. “Vehicle excise duty upheaval, regulatory changes and confusion over diesel have all made their mark on the market this year,” SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said.

2018-11-05,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States reimposes oil and financial sanctions against Iran on Monday, significantly turning up the pressure on Tehran in order to curb its missile and nuclear programs and counter its growing military and political influence in the Middle East. The move will restore U.S. sanctions that were lifted under a 2015 nuclear deal negotiated by the administration of President Barack Obama, and add 300 new designations in Iran’s oil, shipping, insurance and banking sectors. President Donald Trump announced in May that his administration was withdrawing from what he called the “worst ever” agreement negotiated by the United States. Other parties to the deal, including Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia, have said they will not leave.  Details of the sanctions will be released at a news conference scheduled for 8:30 a.m. EST (1330 GMT) with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. China, India, South Korea, Japan and Turkey - all top importers of Iranian oil - are among eight countries expected to be given temporary exemptions from the sanctions to ensure crude oil prices are not destabilized. The countries will deposit Iran’s revenue in an escrow account, U.S. officials have said.  Washington has said it will ensure a well supplied global oil market, with help from ally Saudi Arabia, as Iran oil is cut back. Front-month Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $72.53 per barrel on Monday. The reimposition of the sanctions comes as the United States is focused on U.S. congressional and gubernatorial elections on Tuesday. Campaigning in Chattanooga, Tennessee, late on Sunday, Trump said his “maximum pressure” policy against Iran was working.  “Iran is a much different country than it was when I took office,” said Trump, adding: “They wanted to take over the whole Middle East. Right now they just want to survive.” Earlier, thousands of Iranians chanted “Death to America” at a rally to mark the anniversary of the seizure of the U.S. Embassy during the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The International Monetary Fund said on Thursday that Iran should implement policies to safeguard its macroeconomic stability in the face of sanctions. Senior Iranian officials have dismissed concerns about the impact to its economy. “America will not be able to carry out any measure against our great and brave nation ... We have the knowledge and the capability to manage the country’s economic affairs,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi told state TV on Friday.

2018-11-05,"SEOUL, Nov 5 (Reuters) - South Korea has been granted a waiver from the United States on Iranian oil imports just as U.S. sanctions against Tehran come into force, a South Korean government official said on Monday. South Korea, a U.S. ally and one of Asia’s biggest buyers of Iranian oil, asked Washington for “maximum flexibility” last week, after some of its construction firms cancelled energy-related contracts in the Islamic republic due to financing difficulties. The United States said on Friday it would temporarily allow eight importers to keep buying Iranian oil after it re-imposed sanctions on the country’s crude flows from Monday, aiming to force Iran to curb its nuclear, missile and regional activities. Under U.S. law, exceptions can be granted for up to 180 days. “Petrochemicals are key to our economy, and we stressed that if we’re hit by the Iran sanctions, it would pose grave challenges to our whole economy,” the official said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. Iran’s biggest oil customers - all in Asia - have been seeking waivers to sanctions to allow them to continue buying some of the Islamic republic’s oil. South Korea, the world’s fifth-biggest crude oil buyer, mainly purchases an ultra-light form of crude oil from Iran known as condensate. Seoul also won an exemption from the United States to continue financial transactions with the sanctioned Iranian central bank to facilitate oil imports, the official said. In 2012, South Korea received a waiver on U.S. sanctions by importing limited amounts of Iranian oil during the previous round of sanctions that were lifted in early 2016. South Korean buyers have reduced their purchases of Iranian oil and turned to alternative sources such as American and African crude in recent months due to expensive Middle East grades and uncertainty over trade with Iran. In September, South Korea’s imports of Iranian oil fell to zero for the first time since 2012. In the first nine months of the year, its Iranian oil shipments dropped nearly 50 percent year-on-year to 58.2 million barrels, according to data from Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC).

2018-11-05,"(Repeats Nov. 2 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2CXAFBR By John Kemp LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The recovery in oil prices since the downturn of 2014/15 looks a lot like the upward adjustments that followed the slumps of 2008/09 and 1997/98, which could provide clues about what happens next. The oil market is strongly cyclical, and although no two cycles are the same, they often show similar characteristics (“Cyclical behaviour of oil prices”, Reuters, June 4, 2018). Spot prices and calendar spreads exhibit cyclical movements that correlate closely with the market, alternating between periods of under- and over-supply (tmsnrt.rs/2CXAFBR). Brent’s six-month calendar spread seems to have reached a major cyclical peak in April 2018, up from a post-slump trough in January 2015, before trending downwards. Spot prices may have reached a similar peak in early October 2018. Although it is too early to be certain, most hedge funds and other money managers have liquidated a large share of their bullish positions in recent weeks. In the recent recovery, Brent calendar spreads rose for 39 months from trough to the first major peak, which is roughly comparable with recoveries in 1998-2000 (21 months) and 2009-2011 (33 months). Spot prices have risen for 33 months from trough to their peak in October, which is also broadly comparable with recoveries in 1998-2000 (22 months) and 2008-2011 (28 months). Oil prices, spreads and the reactions of producers and consumers suggest the market has passed the first major cyclical peak after the slump of 2014/15. In the recovery phase of the cycle, the oil market is characterised by a rapid advance in consumption and a slower increase in production, absorbing excess inventories built up during the preceding slump. But as spot prices increase and calendar spreads tighten, consumption growth slows and production growth accelerates, eventually arresting and reversing the rise in spot prices and spreads. This cyclical sequence describes the oil market’s development in 2018 almost perfectly, confirming this is a fairly typical cyclical recovery (notwithstanding the novelty of OPEC+ and U.S. sanctions on Iran). Consumption growth has started to slow in the advanced economies and emerging markets in response to higher prices while output is rising strongly in the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. Spot prices and spreads are now softening to avert or at least mitigate a period of potential oversupply in 2019/2020. Lower prices should eventually restrain the excessive growth in output from OPEC+ members and especially U.S. shale producers as well as buying back some lost consumption growth. Shocks could still move oil prices sharply higher or lower in the coming months, with Iran sanctions, further disruption in Venezuela, Libya or Nigeria, and an economic recession the most likely candidates. After the major cyclical peak in 2011, prices remained relatively high, albeit gradually declining, for three more years, as a result of supply disruptions in Libya, Venezuela, Nigeria, Iraq and Iran. Something similar could keep oil prices elevated throughout 2019/2020, especially if production from Iran, Venezuela or Libya collapses. But unless there is another shock, the cyclical recovery that began in 2015/2016 now appears complete and oil prices are adjusting to prevent oversupply and an unwanted build-up of stocks in 2019/2020.

2018-11-05,"* U.S. sanctions against Iran’s fuel exports start Monday * Washington grants temporary waivers to key buyers By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Monday as the start to U.S. sanctions against Iran’s fuel exports was softened by waivers that will allow some countries to still import Iranian crude, at least temporarily. Front-month Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $72.53 per barrel at 0030 GMT on Monday, down 30 cents, or 0.4 percent from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 27 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $62.87 a barrel. Brent has lost more than 16 percent in value since early October, while WTI has declined by more than 18 percent since then. Traders said prices have been coming under pressure since it became clear that Washington was allowing several countries to continue importing crude from Iran despite the sanctions, which officially started on Monday. The United States said on Friday it will temporarily allow eight importers to keep buying Iranian oil when it re-imposes sanctions, aimed at forcing Iran to curb its nuclear, missile and regional activities. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who announced the decision, did not name the eight, which he referred to as “jurisdictions,” a term that might include importers such as Taiwan which the United States does not regard as a country. China, India, South Korea, Turkey, Italy, the United Arab Emirates and Japan have been the top importers of Iran’s oil, while Taiwan occasionally buys cargoes of Iranian crude but is not a major buyer. “All eyes will be on the outcome of negotiations on possible waivers to U.S. sanctions on Iran. Any deals allowing oil importers to continue buying from Iran could see prices come under further pressure,” ANZ bank said on Monday. Oil markets have already adjusted to the Iran sanctions, gradually dialling back imports in preparations. “Iranian exports and production had been declining steadily in advance. Market surveys of Iranian exports show a decline of more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) as of October from May,” Edward Bell, commodity analyst at Emirates NBD bank said. On the demand side, Bell warned that consumption may be slowing due to an economic slowdown, as seen in a sharp drop in refining profits for key fuels like gasoline. “Sagging refining margins at a time of weak crude prices sends a very telling message to us that demand is underperforming,” he said.
