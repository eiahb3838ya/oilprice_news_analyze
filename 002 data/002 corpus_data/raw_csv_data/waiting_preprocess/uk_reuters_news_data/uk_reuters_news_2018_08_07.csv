2018-08-07,"(Adds more CEO quotes, background) By Oksana Kobzeva MOSCOW, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Russian petrochemicals producer Sibur is examining various options on capital markets, its chief executive told Reuters on Tuesday, while declining to confirm concrete plans for an initial public offering (IPO). Financial market sources told Reuters last month Sibur was preparing an IPO that could raise $2-$3 billion and potentially take place by the end of the year. “We are considering the different options on the capital markets as and when necessary. Now it’s to early to say about the concrete plans,” Dmitry Konov said in an interview, without detailing the options. Businessman Leonid Mikhelson, the head of and a major shareholder in Russia’s largest gas producer Novatek, owns 48.5 percent of Sibur, which is the largest petrochemical producer in Eastern Europe. Mikhelson’s business partner Gennady Timchenko owns 17 percent, while China’s Sinopec and Silk Fund control 10 percent each. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters last month that Mikhelson might sell part of his stake, while Timchenko and another shareholder, Kirill Shamalov, both subjected to U.S. sanctions, were likely to retain their shares. Shamalov owns 3.9 percent in Sibur. Given most of Sibur’s revenue is made in U.S. dollars, Konov said the largest part of the firm’s debt should also be denominated in the currency. He said capital spending was peaking in 2018 as construction works at a petrochemical complex in western Siberia, known as ZapSibNefteKhim, were expected to be completed in May 2019. The installation and start-up works need to be done before ZapSibNefteKhim, which will be one of the world’s five biggest petrochemical plants, is due to come on stream, he added. Sibur is considering building a second big plant, known as the Amur Gas Chemical Complex (GCC), and may make a final decision at the end of 2019, Konov said. According to the company’s web site, Amur GCC will have a capacity of 1.5 million tonnes per year of ethylene, to be further transformed into polymer products. Sibur said last month investment in this plant could total up to $8 billion and it was looking to share the cost with partners from Asia. The company said on Tuesday its first-half core earnings rose 18.7 percent year-on-year, helped by higher liquefied petroleum gas prices. Revenue rose 21.6 percent to 257.7 billion roubles ($4.1 billion), lifted mainly by its midstream business. $1 = 63.4796 roubles

2018-08-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global energy trader Gunvor Group has shaken up its management and appointed a new global head of risk as it re-aligns its offices after weathering a tough year, sources familiar with the matter said.  Since chief executive Torbjorn Tornqvist sold some of his shares to employees, the firm has steadily been beefing up its management. Tornqvist currently holds 64 percent of the company through a family trust.  A seven-person management committee became a nine-person executive committee at the start of 2018. The year has also seen a generational shift with some of the old guard leaving the Geneva-based firm that was founded in 2000.  After 12 years at the company, the company’s head of crude oil trading, Jose Orti, is retiring. Pascal Michel, who was the former head of gasoil trading, was appointed the new global head of risk in June. Michel is taking the reins from Tim Legge, who announced his retirement earlier this year. Also this month, Stephane Degenne was appointed the new head of structured trade development after being head of crude for Europe and Asia, while Jerome Gonelle, who was co-head of gasoline with Stephen Kuster, will oversee coordination between global trading desks.  “It’s part of the company’s move to strengthen management, by promoting long-time traders and hiring new hungry ones as some retire,” a source said.  Julien La Chon, who was head of business development in Asia, also left in the last week. Gunvor’s Asia presence has also seen other changes. Patrick Martin formally became the managing director in Singapore in May after being named interim head in January. As part of a wider reshaping of its activities, Gunvor decided to close its Bahamas trading office and open a London one focussed on natural gas. The firm suffered a sharp profit drop last year after investing heavily in building a North American presence although it expects to reap the rewards this year.  Other departures in the last few weeks include the firm’s head of market research David Fyfe as well as its head of human resources Chris Gribben.  The trading environment has been harsh for many traders in 2018 after a somewhat lacklustre 2017. Many traders caught out in abrupt price swings relating to U.S. crude. BP reported a loss in trading in the second quarter while Royal Dutch Shell said its first half trading profits fell short of expectations.

Blockade and sanctions destroy societies and do not weaken regimes,” he said at a news conference. “We consider them (sanctions on Iran) a strategic mistake and incorrect but we will abide by them to protect the interests of our people. We will not interact with them or support them but we will abide by them,” he added. U.S. President Donald Trump pledged on Tuesday that firms doing business with Tehran would be barred from the United States, as new U.S. sanctions against Iran took effect. The United States and Iran, increasingly at odds, are Iraq’s two biggest allies, and the sanctions put Abadi’s outgoing government in a difficult position. Tuesday’s sanctions target Iran’s purchases of U.S. dollars, metals trading, coal, industrial software and the auto sector. Global oil prices rose on Tuesday on concern sanctions could cut world supply, although the toughest measures targeting Iran’s oil exports do not take effect for four more months.

2018-08-07,"* U.S. bond yields rise on supply, stock gains * Turkish lira bounces after Monday drubbing, but still shaky * Euro, sterling tick higher as dollar eases * Oil prices gain on Iran sanctions, supply signals * Sterling stumbles to five-month low versus euro By Laila Kearney NEW YORK, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Equity markets around the world climbed to approach a six-month high on Tuesday, buoyed by a rebound in Chinese stocks, while corporate earnings helped push Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 index towards record levels. Oil prices advanced as the United States’ revived sanctions against major crude exporter Iran. The rise in stock prices prompted investors to sell safe-haven investments ahead of the first piece of this week’s $78 billion quarterly government refunding, sending U.S. Treasury yields higher. “It’s the bounce in stocks and other risky assets that caused an uptick in yields,” said Mike Lorizio, head of U.S. Treasuries trading at Manulife Asset Management in Boston. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 171.68 points, or 0.67 percent, to 25,673.86, the S&P 500 gained 11.49 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,861.89 and the Nasdaq Composite added 20.95 points, or 0.27 percent, to 7,880.63. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.61 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.72 percent. Powered by gains in technology stocks and a strong second-quarter U.S. earnings season amid economic optimism, the S&P 500 was within reach of a record peak it hit on Jan. 26. Shares of Google’s parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook were up between 0.3 percent to 0.7 percent. Chinese stocks rebounded overnight on hopes of fresh government spending, following a four-day selloff that had knocked them down about 6 percent. Stock markets in London, Paris and Frankfurt then rose 0.7 percent to 1 percent as Europe’s investors cheered both the move up in commodity stocks and results from Italy’s biggest bank UniCredit Currency markets remained volatile, although less so than in recent sessions, as the dollar dipped. The U.S. dollar weakened against the euro as the Chinese yuan showed more stability. The euro bounced to $1.16 from a near six-week low despite a second day of disappointing German economic data, while sterling recouped some ground after Brexit worries had pushed it to an 11-month low. Sterling fell to a five-month low against the euro as the latter rebounded and investors fretted Britain could crash out of the European Union without securing a trade deal. Turkey’s lira recovered as much as two percent from Monday’s losses of more than five percent after Washington moved to end duty-free access to U.S. markets for some Turkish exports. The U.S. Treasury Department will sell $34 billion in three-year notes at 1 p.m. (1700 GMT) in the largest three-year auction in eight years. It will sell a record amount of 10-year debt worth $26 billion on Wednesday, and an all-time high of $18 billion in 30-year bonds on Thursday. Brent crude prices climbed as the U.S. revived sanctions against Iran. U.S. crude rose 0.65 percent to $69.46 per barrel and Brent was last at $74.66, up 1.23 percent. The first batch of U.S. sanctions against Iran officially came into effect at 12:01 a.m. EST (0401 GMT) on Tuesday. They target Iran’s U.S. dollar purchases, metals trading, coal, industrial software and its auto sector. Additional reporting by Marc Jones, Ahmad Ghaddar and Helen

2018-08-07,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) cut its 2018 earnings forecast on Tuesday due to higher fuel prices, although the downgrade was smaller than some analysts had feared, prompting shares in the world’s biggest container shipping company to rise. The container shipping industry has suffered from low freight rates amid a global oversupply of vessels, while Maersk and rivals have warned a global trade war could hit business.  “We continue to encounter very high bunker (fuel) prices, which we have not been able to get fully compensated for in freight rates, leading to an adjustment in our expectations for the full-year 2018,” said Chief Executive Soren Skou. However, the Danish company added spot freight rates had recovered after a significant drop in the second quarter, and its volumes were growing in line with the market. Maersk is more reliant than ever on the shipping industry after selling its oil and gas business last year, and plans to step up competition to delivery companies UPS (UPS.N) and Fedex (FDX.N) by expanding in transport and logistics. The company now expects earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of between $3.5 billion and $4.2 billion this year, down from the $4.0-$5.0 billion seen previously. “Rising fuel prices are really hurting profits in an industry under pressure,” Sydbank analyst Morten Imsgard said. Following the unexpected announcement, Maersk’s shares initially fell more than 5 percent, but then jumped to close 6.4 percent higher at 8,954 Danish crowns. A Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S SmartEstimate forecast showed  analysts had already slashed their 2018 earnings expectations for Maersk to an average of $3.69 billion ahead of the warning. “Some people just sell immediately when they see a profit warning issued. But the market may have feared an even more dramatic profit warning,” Imsgard said. Maersk said it still expected to make an underlying profit this year. Its previous guidance was for an underlying profit above the $356 million achieved last year. The company, due to publish full quarterly earnings on Aug. 17, said EBITDA stood at $900 million in the second quarter on revenue of $9.5 billion. Average bunker fuel prices were 28 percent higher in the period compared with a year earlier, while freight rates were 1.2 percent lower, it said.

2018-08-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and Russia started to raise their oil production several weeks before the formal decision to increase output was taken by OPEC and its allies towards the end of June. Saudi Arabia increased its production to 10.49 million barrels per day (bpd) in June from 10.03 million in May and 9.87 million bpd in April, according to government data submitted to OPEC. (Chart: tmsnrt.rs/2M7dhH5) Russia’s Rosneft also started to raise output from late May, anticipating a relaxation of the supply curbs, according to an investor presentation released with the company’s second-quarter results on Tuesday. The two largest suppliers within OPEC+ adjusted production first and then invited other members to ratify the decision that had already been taken when OPEC and non-OPEC producers met in Vienna on June 22 and 23. The sequence of events confirms the locus of decision-making and power has shifted decisively away from OPEC and OPEC+ to Saudi Arabia and Russia. OPEC has been marginalised as a decision-making group; the oil market has moved into a post-OPEC era where management is undertaken by Riyadh and Moscow with some political input from Washington. The implication that the decision to increase production was taken and started to be implemented well before the OPEC+ meeting is consistent with movements in hedge fund positioning, spot prices and spreads. Hedge fund managers began to reduce their bullish position in Brent and WTI crudes and options weeks before the decision was formally taken and announced. Net long positions in Brent and WTI were cut from a peak of 1.093 billion barrels in mid-April to 790 million barrels by the end of the first week in June, and have changed relatively little since then. Front-month Brent futures peaked around $80 per barrel on May 22-23 and slid through most of June ahead of the OPEC meeting. Brent calendar spreads have also been sliding since late April as traders anticipated greater availability of crude in the second half of the year. The fact that the decision to raise output, and probably by how much, had already been taken helps explain much of what transpired in Vienna. Iran’s oil minister, who initially appeared to oppose any rise in output, eventually consented to a statement that signalled an increase but without numbers or country allocations. Because the output increase had already been agreed between Saudi Arabia and Russia, and was in fact underway, Iran had little choice. The same is true for a number of other OPEC members that opposed an output increase. The Iranian minister could have refused to agree to the statement, in which the output increase would have continued anyway, or agreed to a consensus statement that omitted contentious allocations. Unsurprisingly, the minister opted for the latter, since it provided a modicum of face-saving, but it shows the extent to which other members of OPEC now have minimal bargaining power. Russia and especially Saudi Arabia have strong reasons to want to keep OPEC and OPEC+ formally involved in decision-making. OPEC provides a convenient political shield against criticism from consumer countries, especially the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump’s twitter messages have blamed rising oil prices on OPEC rather than Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s de facto leader, specifically. Saudi Arabia will probably want to ensure that output decisions remain attributed to OPEC or OPEC+ rather than assume sole responsibility or joint accountability with Russia, which is not a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC allows Saudi Arabia to deflect criticism of its production decisions and helps separate oil policy from other aspects of the bilateral relationship such as security and policy towards Iran. But the fact that decisions are taken in the name of OPEC should not obscure the fact real decision-making has moved elsewhere. The real negotiations now take place between Riyadh and Moscow, behind closed doors and far away from OPEC headquarters in Vienna, reflecting their market calculations, and relationships with the United States.

2018-08-07,"PHNOM PENH, Aug 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Thousands of people in Laos, whose homes were swept away when a dam burst, are sheltering in areas contaminated by landmines, humanitarians said, as floods and mud hamper aid delivery. The United Nations (U.N.) said on Monday that 34 people were reported dead, 97 were missing and 6,000 had been evacuated due to flash floods that followed the collapse of a hydropower dam in Laos last month. Attapeu Province in southern Laos is “highly contaminated” by unexploded ordnance, it said, with almost 320 hectares (791 acres) in Sanamxay district, where people are sheltering in camps, “confirmed hazardous areas”. “There’s a real danger that explosive items on or in the ground will have moved,” said Blossum Gilmour, country director for Mines Advisory Group (MAG), a British charity that works to clear unexploded ordnance, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “Areas which have been cleared of bombs may need re-clearing ... But also, as people are evacuated from their homes, they may be relocated to places which have not yet been cleared.” Laos is the most heavily bombed country per capita in the world as a result of bombing by the United States when it was waging war in neighbouring Vietnam in the decade up to 1973, according to MAG. Much of the Southeast Asian nation is still contaminated by landmines, despite decades of clearance efforts, with about 300 new casualties each year, many of them children, it says. Laos was hit by a tropical storm on July 18 and 19, which caused flooding in parts of 13 provinces, including Attapeu, the U.N. said. As floodwaters rose, a saddle dam that was part of Laos’ $1.2 billion Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy hydropower project collapsed, sending torrents of water crashing into neighboring villages. The U.N. said three camps “remain largely inaccessible” and that aid officials are in discussion with the military about using its helicopters to provide “last mile delivery” of relief items, including food. With seasonal rains continuing until September and water levels rising in the Mekong River and its tributaries, “flooding across the country may spread further,” the U.N. said.

2018-08-07,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - California air regulators on Tuesday said they plan to keep tightening state vehicle emissions rules despite a Trump administration proposal last week that would strip the state of the ability to set its own limits. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) proposed maintaining strict Obama-era rules mandating rising fuel efficiency requirements annually through 2025. The Trump administration has proposed freezing federal vehicle emissions requirements at 2020 levels through 2026. “California will take all actions to ensure that the smart standards we developed in partnership with the auto industry to cut greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles stay in place,” said CARB Chair Mary Nichols in a statement from Sacramento.  “Dirty, gas guzzling vehicles are a direct assault on public health, and foreclose our ability to rein in air pollution and greenhouse gases,” she added.   California’s decision is nationally significant because the state is the largest U.S. auto market. Also, a dozen states and the District of Columbia have adopted California’s emissions rules, accounting for more than a third of all U.S. vehicle sales. California is seeking public comments on ways to make the rules more flexible while still meeting goals to reduce carbon emissions. The Trump administration said the Obama era rules were “not appropriate” and its freeze would help make vehicles more affordable. It said that under its proposal vehicles would average 37 miles per gallon in 2026, compared with 46.8 mpg under the Obama rule. California and 18 other states said last week they will fight the Trump administration’s freeze in court, a legal battle that could leave automakers in regulatory limbo for years. Last month, Nichols told Reuters California wants to work with automakers on revisions and she sees a “window” for a deal in coming months. Two trade groups representing General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Toyota Motor Corp and other major automakers, sent letters to California Governor Jerry Brown and U.S. President Donald Trump last week urging negotiations for a compromise on one set of nationwide rules. Automakers want changes to address shifts in consumer demand but also favor efficiency requirements continuing to rise.  California said under the Trump administration’s preferred option, emissions could increase by almost 14 million metric tons per year by 2025. The administration says freezing the limits would have little impact on average global temperature, even as projected U.S. oil consumption would increase by about 500,000 barrels daily. California has received a waiver to set its own emissions rules as well as authority to require automakers to build a rising number of zero-emission vehicles. The Trump administration has proposed revoking that authority.

2018-08-07,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Shale oil producer Continental Resources on Tuesday raised its 2018 production outlook, citing improved performance in North Dakota and operational efficiencies, as well as increased drilling activity in Oklahoma.   The gains come as U.S. oil prices have climbed to near $70 a barrel, spurring a jump in output from shale producers hard hit by the 2014 downturn in prices.  Continental bumped the lower end of its 2018 annual production view by 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) to between 290,000 boe/d and 300,000 boe/d. It increased its annual exit rate guidance by 10,000 boe/d to up to 325,000 boe/d. Overall production for its second quarter rose roughly 25 percent from last year to 284,059 boe/d.  Continental also increased its expected 2018 capital expenditures by $400 million to $2.7 billion, of which about $275 million is associated with a mineral rights deal Continental disclosed earlier this week with Franco-Nevada Corp. The company also will allocate $200 million to increased drilling and completions activity, adding three rigs by the end of the year. A third of that spending will be focused on the Bakken shale, with the remainder dedicated to Oklahoma.   In the North Dakota Bakken, production climbed by 35 percent from the prior year to 151,805 boe/d during the latest quarter, accounting for more than half of Continental’s total production. The company expects to add one rig in the Bakken by the year’s end, bringing its total there to seven.  In one Oklahoma oil formation, quarterly production jumped by more than 60 percent from the prior year to 51,722 boe/d, the company said.  Shares of Continental were roughly flat in after-market trading at $62.25. The company posted revenues of $1.14 billion for the quarter, up from $661.5 million a year ago, and in line with analysts’ consensus forecasts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income for the second quarter was $242.5 million, or 65 cents per share, versus a loss of $62.6 million last year. Excluding one-time items, Continental earned $272.9 million, or 73 cents per share during the quarter, up from a loss of $1.8 million in the same period a year ago. Analysts had forecast earnings of 71 cents per adjusted share during the quarter. The company will host a quarterly earnings call on Wednesday.

2018-08-07,"BOGOTA/CARACAS, Aug 7 (Reuters) - A former Venezuelan municipal police chief and anti-government activist says he helped organize an operation to launch armed drones over a military rally on Saturday that President Nicolas Maduro has called an assassination attempt. In an interview, Salvatore Lucchese, a Venezuelan activist who was previously imprisoned for his role in past protests, told Reuters he orchestrated the attack with a loose association of anti-Maduro militants known generally in Venezuela as the “resistance.” The “resistance” referred to by Lucchese is a diffuse collection of street activists, student organizers and former military officers. It has little formal structure, but is known in the country mostly for organizing protests in recent years in which demonstrators have clashed with police and soldiers. Reuters could not independently verify Lucchese’s claims about the attack, in which drones flew over the rally in central Caracas. Explosives aboard the drones detonated, injuring seven military officers and sending attendees scurrying for cover. Lucchese described the incident as part of a sustained, armed effort against Maduro. He declined to describe his precise role in the operation, in the broader resistance or identify others involved, citing the need to protect their identity. “We had an objective and in the moment we were not able to materialize it 100 percent,” Lucchese said in an interview in Bogota, where he is traveling because of activities with other opposition figures. “The armed struggle will continue.” Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not reply to a request for comment. Earlier this year, Lucchese parted ways with Popular Will, a prominent opposition party, saying he disagreed with its continued dialogue with Maduro’s administration. The government is widely criticized for authoritarian tactics, human rights abuses and economic policies that have led to recession and malnutrition across the formerly prosperous Andean nation. Juan Guaido, one of Popular Will’s national leaders, said Lucchese was expelled for “differences with the party and the national leadership” but did not elaborate further. Guaido also told Reuters Popular Will rejects the use of violence, a position echoed by other mainstream opposition parties in the wake of the attack. Maduro, who was chosen by late leftist President Hugo Chavez as the Socialist Party candidate to succeed him in 2013, often says Venezuela’s problems are the result of an “economic war” by enemies abroad, including the United States. He blamed the drone attack on right-wing opposition figures and foreign enablers, specifically citing the government of neighboring Colombia. Colombia’s government has denied any involvement. Venezuelan authorities over the weekend arrested six people, including one suspect who had been detained for protests in 2014 and another wanted for involvement in a 2017 military base attack. The government said the drones carried plastic explosives detonated remotely. Saturday’s blasts, which shook television footage from the rally and rattled nearby buildings, differed from previous suggestions by Maduro’s government of pending attacks against it. Maduro and top aides have spoken of foiled assassination and coup plots in the past, but provided little evidence for them. Now, it remains unclear exactly how organized or equipped armed opponents may be. A little-known group called the National Movement of Soldiers in T-Shirts over the weekend also claimed responsibility for the drone attack. It, too, describes itself as part of the “resistance.” Lucchese declined to say whether he is associated with Soldiers in T-Shirts. A member of the group, who declined to be identified by name, in an exchange with Reuters via a messaging platform declined to comment on Lucchese. The 52-year-old activist first drew attention after being jailed for ten months starting in 2014 for refusing to break up anti-Maduro protests. As police chief of the municipality of San Diego, in central Carabobo state, he disobeyed Interior Ministry orders to clear demonstrators, Lucchese said. His account of the arrest and jail sentence is supported by a ruling on his conviction published by Venezuela’s Supreme Court at the time. The government released Lucchese at the end of his sentence in February 2015, according to Lucchese and local media reports. Reuters could not find government documentation of his release. Lucchese told Reuters he left Venezuela for an undisclosed location last August, after learning the government sought his arrest once more, this time for treason and inciting military rebellion. The warrant was widely reported by Venezuelan media in recent months, but Reuters was unable to review a copy of it. Lucchese said he now resides abroad and continues to work with other anti-Maduro activists, stressing that armed resistance is the only way to topple Maduro. “No dictator leaves power peacefully,” he told Reuters.

2018-08-07,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Tuesday after U.S. sanctions on Iranian goods went into effect, intensifying concerns that sanctions on Iranian oil, expected in November, could cause supply shortages. Renewed U.S. sanctions against OPEC member Iran officially went into effect at 12:01 a.m. EDT. The sanctions did not include Iran’s oil exports. The country exported almost 3 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in July. The sanctions target Iran’s U.S. dollar purchases, metals trading, coal, industrial software and its auto sector.   U.S. sanctions on Iran’s energy sector are set to be re-imposed after a 180-day “wind-down period” ending on Nov. 4.  “It certainly is a reminder to everyone that the U.S. is serious about sanctions, and it’s doubtful they will grant waivers,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital Management in New York. Brent futures LCOc1 rose 90 cents, or 1.2 percent, to settle at $74.65 a barrel, after hitting a session high of $74.90.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 settled 16 cents, or 0.2 percent, higher at $69.17 a barrel, down from an earlier high of $69.83. Along with geopolitical tensions that could impact Iran’s crude output, traders are also keeping a close eye on U.S. inventories, which are expected to fall 3.3 million barrels in the week ended August 3, according to analysts polled on Tuesday. [EIA/S] Crude futures briefly rose in post settlement trade, with WTI at $69.07 a barrel, on data from the American Petroleum Institute that showed U.S. crude inventories fell 6 million barrels last week. Oil prices rose earlier in the trading session after the U.S. sanctions on Iran went into effect, but gains were limited as market participants lacked clear signs on just how much the proposed oil sanctions would affect Iranian crude output, Kilduff said. WTI faced further resistance, he said, amid a reported uptick in U.S. imports of Saudi oil.     U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that the sanctions were “the most biting sanctions ever imposed”. “Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States,” he added. Many European countries, China and India, oppose the sanctions, but the U.S. government said it wants as many countries as possible to stop buying Iranian oil. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said his country opposes sanctions on Iran, but will abide by them to protect its own interests. (GRAPHIC: Shipped Iran crude oil exports: reut.rs/2vjGcyb) “The market continues to price in geopolitical risk from the reimposition of sanctions by the U.S. on Iran,” said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “The reports that Saudi Arabia’s production actually dropped in July continue to provide support for the market.” Saudi Arabia’s crude production dropped about 200,000 bpd last month, two sources at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said on Friday, despite a pledge by the Saudis and top producer Russia to raise output from July, with Saudi Arabia promising a “measurable” supply boost. Meanwhile, U.S. crude production, which has climbed dramatically fueled largely by increased output from shale formations, may now rise more slowly as prices drop, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s monthly report. Output was expected to rise 1.31 million bpd to 10.68 million bpd in 2018, lower than last month’s forecast of growth of 1.44 million bpd to 10.79 million, the EIA said. “We continue to expect Brent crude oil spot prices to fall towards $70 per barrel by the end of 2018, as the market appears to be fairly balanced in the coming months,” said Linda Capuano, EIA Administrator.

2018-08-07,"MAPUTO (Reuters) - Mozambique’s government on Tuesday approved contracts giving exclusive rights to energy companies to act on concessions awarded to them to explore for oil following four years of negotiations and delays that threatened to derail the projects. Cabinet spokeswoman Ana Comoana said the companies could now go ahead with mining operations to tap offshore oil reserves that experts say are enough to supply energy to Britain, France, Germany and Italy for over 20 years.  Mozambique is desperate to plug gaps in government revenue after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cancelled funding in 2016 citing concerns about how $2 billion in loans was spent. “The contracts give the concessionaires exclusive rights to conduct oil operations with the aim to produce oil from the natural resources deposits underneath the areas,” Comoana said following a cabinet meeting. Norwegian company Statoil, Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI), Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) , Delonex Energy, South Africa’s Sasol (SOLJ.J) and Mozambique’s national oil and gas company ENH were awarded the exploration rights in the area of Mozambique’s Northern Zambezi basin, known as block 5, in 2015. Statoil - now known as Equinor (EQNR.OL) - quit negotiations in January while Delonex this year withdrew from its concession over the deadlock with government. More than $30 billion is expected to be invested in Mozambique’s natural gas sector to build capacity to produce 20 million tonnes per year of LNG, with the first exports due to start in 2021.

2018-08-07,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria’s security forces stopped lawmakers entering parliament on Tuesday in a blockade seen by the opposition as a bid to intimidate its leaders, but the presidency condemned the move and the acting president fired the head of the security agency. It is the first such incident since Nigeria became a democracy in 1999 and coincides with increased tension between the National Assembly and the executive ahead of an election in February 2019 when President Muhammadu Buhari will seek a second term. For some, it revived memories of the decades when the military and security forces held sway over politics in a country that has one of Africa’s largest economies. Armed men wearing the black uniform of the Department of State Security (DSS) stood at the gates of the building in the capital Abuja and were later joined by police officers blocking entry for up to an hour, witnesses said. Images of the incident were shared widely on social media. The motive for the blockade was not immediately clear. But a spokesman for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo said in a statement that the DSS director general, Lawal Musa Daura, had been fired. Osinbajo is acting president for Buhari, who last week left for a 10-day holiday in Britain. “The unlawful act, which was done without the knowledge of the presidency, is condemnable and completely unacceptable,” said a separate statement issued later by Osinbajo’s office. It described the move as an “unauthorised takeover of the National Assembly complex” which was “a gross violation of constitutional order, rule of law and all accepted notions of law and order”.  The statement gave no reason for Daura’s dismissal. The presidency later said Matthew B. Seiyefa, the most senior director in the DSS, will act as director general until further notice. The blockade followed the defection of around 50 lawmakers from Buhari’s ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party to the main opposition in the last few weeks. These included the country’s third most senior elected official, Senate President Bukola Saraki. The defections cost the APC its Senate majority and present a challenge to Buhari’s re-election bid because most of those who left joined the opposition People’s Democratic Party which ruled Nigeria from 1999 until Buhari took office in May 2015. Saraki’s supporters said the blockade was part of a plan to impeach and replace him. Parliament went on recess last week until Sept. 25 but meetings were to be held on Tuesday.  “We urge Nigerians and the international community to condemn this illegal invasion of the National Assembly complex and the attempt to asphyxiate the legislature as undemocratic, uncivilized and irresponsible,” said Saraki in a tweet. After the blockade, Saraki’s supporters greeted him with chanting in the parliament building.  “The presidency’s sack of Daura was a damage-control stunt and a knee-jerk gimmick which came as a response to the national and international outcry against the armed invasion of our legislature,” said a PDP statement. The ruling party said attempts to blame its leaders for Tuesday’s blockade were “false allegations” and “mischievous”.  “The use of armed security agents to force political outcomes does not bode well for the February 2019 general election,” said Malte Liewerscheidt, vice president at Teneo Intelligence, in a note.

2018-08-07,"HOUSTON/PUNTO FIJO (Reuters) - Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA has limited the damage from an unprecedented slump in crude exports by transferring oil between tankers at sea and loading vessels in neighboring Cuba to avoid asset seizures. But the OPEC member nation is still fulfilling less than 60 percent of its obligations under supply deals with customers. Venezuela has been pumping oil this year at the lowest rate in three decades after years of underinvestment and a mass exodus of workers. The state-run firm’s collapse has left the country short of cash to fund its embattled socialist government and triggered an economic crisis. PDVSA’s problems were compounded in May when U.S. oil firm ConocoPhillips (COP.N) began seizing PDVSA assets in the Caribbean as payment for a $2 billion arbitration award. An arbitration panel at the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered PDVSA to pay the cash to compensate Conoco for expropriating the firm’s Venezuelan assets in 2007. The seizures left PDVSA without access to facilities such as Isla refinery in Curacao and BOPEC terminal in Bonaire that accounted for almost a quarter of the company’s oil exports. Conoco’s actions also forced PDVSA to stop shipping oil on its own vessels to terminals in the Caribbean, and then onto refineries worldwide, to avoid the risk the cargoes would be seized in international waters or foreign ports. Instead, PDVSA asked customers to charter tankers to Venezuelan waters and load from the company’s own terminals or from anchored PDVSA vessels acting as floating storage units.  The state-run company told some clients in early June it might impose force majeure, a temporary suspension of export contracts, unless they agreed to such ship-to-ship transfers.  PDVSA also requested the customers stop sending vessels to its terminals until it could load those that were already clogging Venezuela’s coastline. Initially, customers were reluctant to undertake the transfers because of costs, safety concerns and the need for specialist equipment and experienced crew. But PDVSA has managed to export about 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil since early July, up from just 765,000 bpd in the first half of June, according to Thomson Reuters data and internal PDVSA shipping data seen by Reuters. That was still 59 percent of the country’s 2.19 million bpd in contractual obligations to customers for that period, and some vessels are still waiting for weeks in Venezuelan waters to load oil. There were about two dozen tankers waiting this week to load over 22 million barrels of crude and refined products at the country’s largest ports, according to Reuters data. “We are not tied to one option or a single loading terminal,” PDVSA President Manuel Quevedo said on Tuesday of the company’s exports. “We have several (terminals) in our country and we have some in the Caribbean, which of course facilitate crude shipping to fulfill our supply contracts.”  PDVSA has also used a route through Cuba to ease the impact of the Conoco seizures. That route is for fuel rather than crude. The Venezuelan company has used a terminal at the port of Matanzas as a conduit mostly for exporting fuel oil, according to two people familiar with the operations and Thomson Reuters shipping data. Venezuela’s fuel oil is burned in some countries to generate electricity.   Two tankers set sail from the Matanzas terminal for Singapore between mid-May and early July, Reuters data showed.    Each ship carried around 500,000 barrels of Venezuelan fuel, Reuters data shows. In recent months, Venezuela has been shipping fuel to Matanzas in small batches, according to the data. PDVSA and Cuba’s state-run oil firm Cupet have used Matanzas to store Venezuelan crude and fuel in the past but exports from the terminal to Asian destinations are rare.  That is in part because vessels that use Cuban ports cannot subsequently dock in the United States due to the U.S. commercial embargo on Cuba. Cupet did not respond to requests for comment. PDVSA has also used ship-to-ship transfers to fulfill an unusual supply contract it has with Cuba’s Cienfuegos refinery. The refinery dates from the 1980s - when Cuba was a close ally of the Soviet Union during the Cold War - and the facility was built to process Russian crude.  PDVSA typically uses its own or leased tankers to bring Russian crude from storage in the nearby Dutch Caribbean island of Curacao to Cienfuegos. But it is now discharging the imported Russian oil at sea in Cayman Islands’ waters via these seaborne transfers. ConocoPhillips last month ratcheted up its collection efforts by moving to depose officials from Citgo Petroleum, PDVSA’s U.S. refining arm, arguing it had improperly claimed ownership of some PDVSA cargoes. Citgo declined to comment.  ConocoPhillips is also preparing new legal actions to get Caribbean courts to recognize its International Chamber of Commerce arbitration award. If it succeeds in those efforts, it would be able to sell the assets to help satisfy the ruling.

2018-08-07,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the world’s biggest brewer, will start building a more than 2 million hectolitre a year brewery in Mozambique in the second half of next year, the company’s Africa head said on Tuesday.  The Mozambique investment will look to fend off competition from rival Heineken (HEIN.AS), which is the middle of building a $100 million brewery in the southern African country. It will also help AB InBev keep pace with demand in a market that saw growth over more than 20 percent in the first half of this year, Ricardo Tadeu, the company’s Africa zone president told journalists in Johannesburg. “It’s a reflection of how much we have been adding on the continent, constantly aiming for growth and putting the money where our mouth is,” he said. Tadeu said the company was not ready to disclose the size of its investment in the new facility, but added that the land acquired for the project would allow for further expansion of brewing capacity in the future. AB InBev already brews the 2M and Laurentina brands in Mozambique in another brewery. Substantial gas reserves discovered off Mozambique’s Indian Ocean coastline more than a decade ago were expected to jumpstart its economy. But progress in setting up the infrastructure to tap them has been glacial, slowing the pace of investment in many sectors. AB InBev paid roughly $100 billion to buy rival SABMiller in 2016, giving it a substantial presence on the continent of more than a billion people. It has operations in 15 markets mainly in southern and east Africa, but also Ghana and Nigeria in west Africa. It announced plans in March to invest $100 million in a new 1 million hectolitre per year brewery in Tanzania, where beer volumes jumped by a fifth last year and its local unit Tanzania Breweries TBL.TZ already runs four facilities. [uL8N1R25C4] “We’re very excited about Africa because we have experience in Latin America and Asia. Some people look at Africa and see a lot of volatility, uncertainty.

2018-08-07,"BEIRUT/LONDON (Reuters) - Companies doing business with Iran will be barred from the United States, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday, as new U.S. sanctions took effect despite pleas from Washington’s allies. Iran dismissed a last-minute offer from the Trump administration for talks, saying it could not negotiate while Washington had reneged on a 2015 deal to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme. Trump decided this year to pull out of the agreement, ignoring pleas from the other world powers that had co-sponsored the deal, including Washington’s main European allies Britain, France and Germany, as well as Russia and China. European countries, hoping to persuade Tehran to continue to respect the deal, have promised to try to lessen the blow of  sanctions and to urge their firms not to pull out. But that has proven difficult: European companies have quit Iran, arguing that they cannot risk their U.S. business. “These are the most biting sanctions ever imposed, and in November they ratchet up to yet another level. Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States. I am asking for WORLD PEACE, nothing less!” Trump tweeted on Tuesday. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif criticized Trump’s tweet as a tired cliche and denounced “US unilateralism.” “And it is not the first time that a warmonger claims he is waging war for ‘world peace’,” Zarif tweeted.  White House national security adviser John Bolton said on Monday Iran’s only chance of escaping sanctions would be to take up an offer to negotiate with Trump for a tougher deal. “If the ayatollahs want to get out from under the squeeze,  they should come and sit down. The pressure will not relent while the negotiations go on,” Bolton, one of the administration’s main hawks on Iran, told Fox News. On Tuesday, Bolton said the sanctions were already working, deterring European companies: “The European governments are still holding to the nuclear deal, but honestly their businesses are running from it as fast as they can so that the effect of the American sanctions really is proceeding regardless.” Few American companies do much business in Iran so the impact of sanctions mainly stems from Washington’s ability to block European and Asian firms from trading there. Among large European companies that have suspended plans to invest in Iran are France’s oil major Total and its big carmakers PSA and Renault. “We have ceased our already restricted activities in Iran in accordance with the applicable sanctions”, said German car and truck manufacturer Daimler. Washington accepts that Iran has complied with the terms of the 2015 deal reached under Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama, but says the agreement is flawed because it is not strict enough. Iran says it will continue to abide by the deal for now, if other countries can help protect it from the economic impact of Washington’s decision to pull out. Tuesday’s sanctions target Iran’s purchases of U.S. dollars,  metals trading, coal, industrial software and its auto sector. Global oil prices rose on Tuesday on concern sanctions could cut world supply, although the toughest measures targeting Iran’s oil exports do not take effect for four more months. Global benchmark Brent crude oil futures were up $1 or 1.36 percent to $74.75 per barrel at 1823 GMT. “It is a reality check that this is happening and that Iran’s oil exports will be hurt when the oil sanctions hit it in November,” chief commodities analyst at Commerzbank Bjarne Schieldrop said. In a speech hours before the sanctions were due to take effect, Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani rejected negotiations as long as Washington was no longer complying with the deal. “If you stab someone with a knife and then you say you want talks, then the first thing you have to do is remove the knife,” Rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on state television. “We are always in favour of diplomacy and talks ... But talks need honesty,” Rouhani said. Iranian Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi said Trump’s withdrawal from the deal meant there was no point negotiating, since Washington had shown it did not abide by its commitments. “And Iran, based on past experience, has no trust in negotiating with the American government.” The nuclear deal is closely associated in Iran with Rouhani, a relative moderate who won two landslide elections on promises to open up the economy to the outside world. European countries fear that by abandoning it, Washington could undermine Rouhani and strengthen the hand of his hardline opponents. Britain, France, Germany and the EU as a bloc said in a joint statement on Monday: “We deeply regret the reimposition of sanctions by the U.S.” Since the sanctions were initially lifted two years ago, Iranian oil exports have risen. But many Iranians have yet to see major economic improvement, and the prospect that Washington would reimpose sanctions has helped drive a collapse in the value of Iran’s currency this year, raising the cost of imports. Iran’s security forces have responded firmly to protests against rising prices. Iran this week made it easier to access foreign currency and said it was prosecuting an ex-central bank official for economic crimes. “(Sanctions) will definitely make daily life harder for Iranians,” said Saeed Leylaz, a Tehran-based economist and political analyst. “But if the government has a serious plan they can control the situation.” Iraq said it did not agree with the U.S. sanctions on its neighbour, but will abide by them to protect its own interests. “As a matter of principle we are against sanctions in the region. Blockade and sanctions destroy societies and do not weaken regimes,” Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on Tuesday.

2018-08-07,"HOUSTON/PUNTO FIJO, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA has limited the damage from an unprecedented slump in crude exports by transferring oil between tankers at sea and loading vessels in neighboring Cuba to avoid asset seizures. But the OPEC member nation is still fulfilling less than 60 percent of its obligations under supply deals with customers. Venezuela has been pumping oil this year at the lowest rate in three decades after years of underinvestment and a mass exodus of workers. The state-run firm’s collapse has left the country short of cash to fund its embattled socialist government and triggered an economic crisis. PDVSA’s problems were compounded in May when U.S. oil firm ConocoPhillips began seizing PDVSA assets in the Caribbean as payment for a $2 billion arbitration award. An arbitration panel at the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered PDVSA to pay the cash to compensate Conoco for expropriating the firm’s Venezuelan assets in 2007. The seizures left PDVSA without access to facilities such as Isla refinery in Curacao and BOPEC terminal in Bonaire that accounted for almost a quarter of the company’s oil exports. Conoco’s actions also forced PDVSA to stop shipping oil on its own vessels to terminals in the Caribbean, and then onto refineries worldwide, to avoid the risk the cargoes would be seized in international waters or foreign ports. Instead, PDVSA asked customers to charter tankers to Venezuelan waters and load from the company’s own terminals or from anchored PDVSA vessels acting as floating storage units. The state-run company told some clients in early June it might impose force majeure, a temporary suspension of export contracts, unless they agreed to such ship-to-ship transfers. PDVSA also requested the customers stop sending vessels to its terminals until it could load those that were already clogging Venezuela’s coastline. Initially, customers were reluctant to undertake the transfers because of costs, safety concerns and the need for specialist equipment and experienced crew. But PDVSA has managed to export about 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil since early July, up from just 765,000 bpd in the first half of June, according to Thomson Reuters data and internal PDVSA shipping data seen by Reuters. That was still 59 percent of the country’s 2.19 million bpd in contractual obligations to customers for that period, and some vessels are still waiting for weeks in Venezuelan waters to load oil. There were about two dozen tankers waiting this week to load over 22 million barrels of crude and refined products at the country’s largest ports, according to Reuters data. “We are not tied to one option or a single loading terminal,” PDVSA President Manuel Quevedo said on Tuesday of the company’s exports. “We have several (terminals) in our country and we have some in the Caribbean, which of course facilitate crude shipping to fulfill our supply contracts.” PDVSA has also used a route through Cuba to ease the impact of the Conoco seizures. That route is for fuel rather than crude. The Venezuelan company has used a terminal at the port of Matanzas as a conduit mostly for exporting fuel oil, according to two people familiar with the operations and Thomson Reuters shipping data. Venezuela’s fuel oil is burned in some countries to generate electricity. Two tankers set sail from the Matanzas terminal for Singapore between mid-May and early July, Reuters data showed. Each ship carried around 500,000 barrels of Venezuelan fuel, Reuters data shows. In recent months, Venezuela has been shipping fuel to Matanzas in small batches, according to the data. PDVSA and Cuba’s state-run oil firm Cupet have used Matanzas to store Venezuelan crude and fuel in the past but exports from the terminal to Asian destinations are rare. That is in part because vessels that use Cuban ports cannot subsequently dock in the United States due to the U.S. commercial embargo on Cuba. Cupet did not respond to requests for comment. PDVSA has also used ship-to-ship transfers to fulfill an unusual supply contract it has with Cuba’s Cienfuegos refinery. The refinery dates from the 1980s - when Cuba was a close ally of the Soviet Union during the Cold War - and the facility was built to process Russian crude. PDVSA typically uses its own or leased tankers to bring Russian crude from storage in the nearby Dutch Caribbean island of Curacao to Cienfuegos. But it is now discharging the imported Russian oil at sea in Cayman Islands’ waters via these seaborne transfers. ConocoPhillips last month ratcheted up its collection efforts by moving to depose officials from Citgo Petroleum, PDVSA’s U.S. refining arm, arguing it had improperly claimed ownership of some PDVSA cargoes. Citgo did not respond to requests for comment. ConocoPhillips is also preparing new legal actions to get Caribbean courts to recognize its International Chamber of Commerce arbitration award. If it succeeds in those efforts, it would be able to sell the assets to help satisfy the ruling.

2018-08-07,"(Adds details on production for 2019, demand data) By Jessica Resnick-Ault NEW YORK, Aug 7 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil production in 2018 was expected to grow at a slower rate than previously forecast amid lower crude prices according to a monthly U.S. government report on Tuesday. U.S. crude production has climbed dramatically, fueled largely by increased output from shale formations, but may now rise more slowly as prices drop. Output was expected to rise 1.31 million barrels per day (bpd) to 10.68 million bpd in 2018, lower than last month’s forecast of growth of 1.44 million bpd to 10.79 million, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The agency slightly increased its expectation for 2019 production growth to 1.02 million bpd from 1.01 previously. The agency expects crude production to average 11.7 million bpd in 2019, compared with 11.8 million bpd previously. Shale output helped to U.S. production over 10 million bpd this year for the first time since the 1970s. The agency had previously expected crude output to average more than 12 million bpd by the fourth quarter of 2019, but revised that quarterly average downward to 11.94 million bpd. Higher production from Russia and members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has put downward pressure on crude oil prices in recent weeks, the agency said. “We continue to expect Brent crude oil spot prices to fall towards $70 per barrel by the end of 2018, as the market appears to be fairly balanced in the coming months,” said Linda Capuano, EIA Administrator. Global benchmark Brent crude was trading at $74.44 a barrel at 12:32 p.m. EDT (1644 GMT). The agency said U.S. oil demand growth was expected to be 470,000 bpd in 2018, unchanged from its previous forecast. Demand growth is expected to rise 290,000 bpd in 2019, compared with 330,000 bpd previously expected.

2018-08-07,"(Adds more CEO quotes, background) By Oksana Kobzeva MOSCOW, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Russian petrochemicals producer Sibur is examining various options on capital markets, its chief executive told Reuters on Tuesday, while declining to confirm concrete plans for an initial public offering (IPO). Financial market sources told Reuters last month Sibur was preparing an IPO that could raise $2-$3 billion and potentially take place by the end of the year. “We are considering the different options on the capital markets as and when necessary. Now it’s to early to say about the concrete plans,” Dmitry Konov said in an interview, without detailing the options. Businessman Leonid Mikhelson, the head of and a major shareholder in Russia’s largest gas producer Novatek, owns 48.5 percent of Sibur, which is the largest petrochemical producer in Eastern Europe. Mikhelson’s business partner Gennady Timchenko owns 17 percent, while China’s Sinopec and Silk Fund control 10 percent each. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters last month that Mikhelson might sell part of his stake, while Timchenko and another shareholder, Kirill Shamalov, both subjected to U.S. sanctions, were likely to retain their shares. Shamalov owns 3.9 percent in Sibur. Given most of Sibur’s revenue is made in U.S. dollars, Konov said the largest part of the firm’s debt should also be denominated in the currency. He said capital spending was peaking in 2018 as construction works at a petrochemical complex in western Siberia, known as ZapSibNefteKhim, were expected to be completed in May 2019. The installation and start-up works need to be done before ZapSibNefteKhim, which will be one of the world’s five biggest petrochemical plants, is due to come on stream, he added. Sibur is considering building a second big plant, known as the Amur Gas Chemical Complex (GCC), and may make a final decision at the end of 2019, Konov said. According to the company’s web site, Amur GCC will have a capacity of 1.5 million tonnes per year of ethylene, to be further transformed into polymer products. Sibur said last month investment in this plant could total up to $8 billion and it was looking to share the cost with partners from Asia. The company said on Tuesday its first-half core earnings rose 18.7 percent year-on-year, helped by higher liquefied petroleum gas prices. Revenue rose 21.6 percent to 257.7 billion roubles ($4.1 billion), lifted mainly by its midstream business. $1 = 63.4796 roubles

2018-08-07,"BOGOTA, Aug 6 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Two dams being built in Guatemala have damaged the environment and local communities, according to a formal complaint by rights groups and indigenous leaders who urged the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to withdraw financing. The complaint filed on Monday alleges that construction of the Pojom II and San Andres hydroelectric dams, financed in part by $13 million from IDB, has polluted water sources for hundreds of indigenous Mayans in northern Huehuetenango province. “These communities depend on water for their livelihoods,” said Liliana Avila, a lawyer with the United States-based Interamerican Association for Environmental Defense (AIDA), one of the groups that submitted the complaint. “The construction of the dams has contaminated rivers, harmed the ability of communities to fish and grow crops and maintain their traditions,” she said by phone. The complaint was submitted to the Independent Consultation and Investigation Mechanism (MICI), an independent accountability body of the IDB, the Washington, D.C.-based multilateral lender. “We do not comment on any complaints filed or ongoing investigations,” said a spokesperson from IDB, which funds development projects throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Along with AIDA, the complaint was submitted by the International Platform Against Impunity, a group of rights organizations from the Netherlands, Switzerland and Central America, and indigenous leaders. The groups said polluted water from the dams has caused health problems among children, including skin rashes and diarrhea. The complaint, seen by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, says that communities living in the Ixquisis region in Huehuetenango were not properly consulted about the projects and their risks. Avila said the projects violate IDB’s own rules, “particularly its policies on environment and sustainability, indigenous people, gender, and information disclosure.” People in Ixquisis have protested the dams since 2014, and there have been almost 100 attacks and threats against them documented since then, said the complaint. The Pojom II dam is operated by Generadora San Mateo S.A, while San Andres is run by Generadora San Andres S.A., both of which are subsidiaries of the privately owned Promocion y Desarrollos Hidricos S.A., according to the complaint. The environmental impact assessments for the adjacent dam projects have been approved by Guatemala’s environment ministry. Avila said she was hopeful the IDB's accountability mechanism would decide within a month to accept the complaint and start an investigation.

2018-08-07,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia plans to require all diesel fuel used in the country contain biodiesel starting next month to boost palm oil consumption, slash fuel imports, and narrow a yawning current account gap. While the proposal has been welcomed by the palm oil industry and government, it has raised concerns among the automobile industry the fuel could impact engine performance. Environmentalists fear the boost to local palm oil consumption will hasten Indonesia’s already fast spreading deforestation. The following explains some of the issues surrounding the drive to increase biodiesel usage. Graphic: Indonesian oil imports: reut.rs/2vfmzan Indonesia currently imports around 400,000 barrels per day of crude oil and a roughly similar amount of refined products, which makes Southeast Asia’s largest economy vulnerable to the sort of increases in global crude prices seen over the past year. With the current account deficit estimated to grow by $8 billion in 2018, the plan is to cut diesel imports by mandating that all diesel consumers, including power plants and railways, use biodiesel that contains 20 percent bio-content (B20), typically palm oil. Officials estimate this will save Indonesia around $6 billion per year. Graphic: Indonesia's rupiah vs U.S.-dollar & current account balance as % of GDP (reut.rs/2LQFfHZ) The programme will increase domestic consumption of palm oil in the world’s largest producer of the edible oil, providing a market for output that has climbed by 35 percent over the past five years. In Indonesia, the bio component in biodiesel consists of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) made from palm oil. Indonesia has 26 FAME producers, including units of palm oil giants like Sinar Mas Group, Wilmar (WLIL.SI), and Musim Mas, according to the Indonesian Biofuels Producers Association (APROBI). FAME is supplied to fuel distributors including Pertamina, blended with petroleum-based diesel and sold to end-users. Graphic: Indonesia's energy sector in decline (reut.rs/2Mc915Y) Currently only around one-quarter of Indonesia’s FAME production capacity is utilised, and the new programme could raise this to up to 50 percent, said Togar Sitanggang, a senior official at the Indonesia Palm Oil Association (GAPKI).  The government has said it will provide incentives to biodiesel producers, but has not provided details. Efforts to increase FAME concentrations in biodiesel have faced resistance from regulators and the automotive and oil industries in the past.  Indonesia is supporting a programme to make 100-percent palm oil-based biodiesel without FAME. Rules introduced in 2015 make B20 mandatory in subsidised biodiesel up to January 2020, after which B30 is scheduled to become mandatory. While B20 use is generally accepted for new vehicles, higher FAME blends may pose problems. FAME has a solvent effect that can corrode engine seals and gaskets, potentially increasing maintenance costs, and requiring special handling and equipment. “High-level biodiesel blends can also impact engine warranties, gel in cold temperatures, and may present unique storage issues,” the U.S. Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) said on its website. Graphic: Indonesia biodiesel & palm oil industry in H1 2018 (reut.rs/2O5MHeM) According to the AFDC, the more FAME there is above 20 percent in biodiesel, the lower its energy content. FAME use could also increase nitrogen oxide emissions, although it greatly reduces other toxic emissions, it said. In a 2016 assessment, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) concluded that biodiesel with no more than 20 percent FAME content was acceptable for vehicles that comply with the Euro IV emissions standard, among other conditions. In a 2015 study by Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT), six passenger vehicles from three manufacturers were driven over 40,000 km (25,000 miles) using B20 biodiesel and regular diesel. The test found that B20 improved vehicle performance and acceleration, and reduced emissions, but the vehicles consumed roughly 4 percent more fuel than vehicles using regular diesel. Tatang Soerawidjaja, chairman of the Indonesian Association of Bioenergy Scientists and Technologists, said extensive tests have shown that B20 poses “no problems” for diesel engines, even in older models. Filters would only need replacement or more frequent cleaning in the early phase of adopting biodiesel use, he said, referring to FAME’s solvent effect when mixed with regular diesel. “The bio content cleans dirt off of the tank’s walls and pipes, and this ends up in the filter,” he said.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.05 percent. The index dipped early and struggled to gain traction amid volatility in Chinese stocks. The Shanghai Composite Index rose over 0.6 percent in early trade following a four-day losing run. It was last up 0.1 percent. Australian stocks dipped 0.25 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.2 percent and Japan’s Nikkei added 0.25 percent. The three major U.S. stock indexes closed higher on Monday amid a strong U.S. earnings season, with results from Berkshire Hathaway impressing and Facebook lifting the Nasdaq after a report it was planning new services. “Global markets are (being) buffeted by conflicting currents. The bottom-up view of the world from a corporate perspective is positive, led by U.S. companies,” wrote Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. “However, the increasing potential for trade disputes to slow the global economy is restraining investor enthusiasm.” The dollar drew support from the persistent international trade tensions. Its index against a basket of six major currencies rose to a near three-week high of 95.515, before pulling back slightly to 95.347. Some analysts see the trade conflict benefiting the U.S. dollar as the nation’s economy is better placed to handle protectionism than emerging markets, and as tariffs may narrow the U.S. trade deficit. Weakness in its peers further bolstered the dollar. The euro fell to a five-week low of $1.1530 overnight, weighed down by worries that Italy could ramp up spending and challenge European Union budget regulations and by a drop in June German industrial orders. The single currency last traded at $1.1559. The pound was also on the back foot, driven on Monday to $1.2920, its weakest since September 2017, after comments by officials raised fears Britain would crash out of the EU without securing a trade agreement. Sterling stood at $1.2940. The dollar was steady at 111.34 yen after edging up 0.1 percent overnight. A big mover was the Turkish lira, which struggled near a record low plumbed on Monday after Washington said it was reviewing Ankara’s duty-free access to the U.S. market as tensions between the two NATO allies ramped up. The lira has lost 27 percent of its value this year, battered primarily by concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan’s drive for greater control over monetary policy. “Currently the impact of the lira’s slide is mostly contained within the country. But fears of a default will begin to increase if the currency keeps depreciating, and such a development could affect some European financial institutions,” said Kota Hirayama, senior emerging markets economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. “The Turkish central bank will have to move quickly and raise interest rates to arrest the lira’s fall before it becomes too late.” In commodities, the previous day’s rise by crude oil flagged as the market braced for the imposition of U.S. sanctions against major crude exporter Iran, set to take effect at 0401 GMT. Benchmark Brent crude oil futures were down 0.05 percent at $73.71 a barrel. They had gained 0.75 percent on Monday after OPEC sources said Saudi production had unexpectedly fallen in July.

2018-08-07,"* U.S. sanctions to bite from 1201 EDT Tuesday * Washington wants other countries to cut Iran oil orders * Hot weather to start affecting oil demand - JPMorgan By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Oil markets started cautiously on Tuesday, as many traders in Asia were reluctant to take on new positions ahead of the introduction of U.S. sanctions against major crude exporter Iran. Spot Brent crude oil futures were at $73.74 per barrel at 0100 GMT on Tuesday, down 1 cent from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 8 cents at $68.93 barrel. U.S. sanctions against major oil exporter Iran are set to kick in at 12:01 a.m. U.S. Eastcoast time (0401 GMT) on Tuesday. Traders in Asia said they were holding back on making bets on oil ahead of European and U.S. trading hours, which tend to see much higher liquidity and stronger price movements. “The U.S. seems hell-bent on regime change in Iran and is reimposing sanctions at midnight Washington time as the 6th becomes the 7th of August,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader. Many other countries, including U.S. allies in Europe and also China and India oppose the introduction of new sanctions, but the U.S. government said it wants as many countries as possible to stop buying Iranian oil. “It is our policy to get as many countries to zero as quickly as possible. We are going to work with individual countries on a case by case basis, but our goal is to reduce the amount of revenue and hard currency going into Iran,” said a senior U.S. administration official on Monday. ANZ bank said a 24-hour strike at three North Sea oil and gas platforms operated by Total, which started at 0500 GMT on Monday, was also supporting prices. The main oil market price drivers of recent months have been output levels by top producers Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States, renewed Iran sanctions, the U.S. vs China trade dispute, and unplanned supply disruptions. Some analysts warned that a global heat wave could also now affect oil demand. Much of the northern hemisphere has been gripped by extreme heat this summer, pushing up demand for industrial and residential cooling. This mostly impacts demand for power fuels like thermal coal and natural gas. But U.S. bank JPMorgan said a warmer than usual fourth quarter, caused by a potential El Niño weather pattern, “can cause droughts, flooding and other natural disasters across the globe, including heatwaves in the U.S. that affect commodities.” “Past instances of El Niño have resulted in sharp drops in U.S. residential and commercial heating oil demand and prices,” it said.

Its index against a basket of six major currencies rose to a near three-week high of 95.515, before pulling back slightly to 95.347. Some analysts see trade conflict benefiting the U.S. dollar as the nation’s economy is better placed to handle protectionism than emerging markets, and as tariffs may narrow the U.S. trade deficit. Weakness in its peers further bolstered the dollar’s strength. The euro fell to a five-week low of $1.1530 overnight, weighed down by worries that Italy could ramp up spending and challenge European Union budget regulations and by a drop in June German industrial orders. The single currency last traded at $1.1557. The pound was also on the back foot, driven on Monday to $1.2920, its weakest since September 2017, after comments by officials raised fears Britain would crash out of the EU without securing a trade agreement. The dollar was steady at 111.35 yen after edging up 0.1 percent overnight. A big mover was the Turkish lira, which fell to a record low on Monday after Washington said it was reviewing Ankara’s duty-free access to the U.S. market as tensions between the two NATO allies ramped up. The lira has lost 27 percent of its value this year, battered primarily by concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan’s drive for greater control over monetary policy. “Currently the impact of the lira’s slide is mostly contained within the country. But fears of a default will begin to increase if the currency keeps depreciating, and such a development could affect some European financial institutions,” said Kota Hirayama, senior emerging markets economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. “The Turkish central bank will have to move quickly and raise interest rates to arrest the lira’s fall before it becomes too late.” In commodities, benchmark Brent crude oil futures were down 0.05 percent at $73.71 a barrel. They had gained 0.75 percent on Monday after OPEC sources said Saudi production had unexpectedly fallen in July.

2018-08-07,"Aug 6 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co (SoCalGas) on Monday raised the estimated cost for the massive leak at its Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in Los Angeles between October 2015 and February 2016 to $1.014 billion. That is up about up 6.3 percent from the company’s $954 million estimate last quarter, according to a quarterly report with U.S. financial regulators. SoCalGas, a unit of California energy company Sempra Energy , warned the “estimate may rise significantly” due to pending lawsuits, possible fines and other costs. It said costs not covered by insurance or delays in receiving insurance payments “could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas’s and Sempra Energy’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.” The utility said the latest estimate included $987 million of costs already recovered or likely to be recovered from insurance. It said about 55 percent of the total cost was for temporary relocation of residents who live near the facility, which is close to the Porter Ranch neighborhood in Los Angeles, including cleanup costs. Aliso Canyon, with a capacity of 86 billion cubic feet (bcf), is SoCalGas’ biggest storage facility. State regulators estimated 4.62 bcf of gas leaked at Aliso Canyon. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day. The facility represents 63 percent of the utility’s gas storage capacity, making it a key part of the company’s ability to deliver fuel to customers, especially on the coldest winter days when demand for heating is highest and the hottest summer days when a lot of gas is used to generate power for air conditioning. State regulators have limited the amount of gas SoCalGas can inject into Aliso Canyon to a total of 34 bcf. They have also said the company can only withdraw gas from the facility when other options are not available to meet demand. Many residents and government officials want SoCalGas to shut Aliso Canyon. The California Public Utilities Commission has said it expects to complete its evaluation under Senate Bill 380 by Nov. 14 to determine the impact of reducing or eliminating the use of Aliso Canyon.

2018-08-07,"HAMBURG, Aug 7 (Reuters) - China may have to start buying U.S. soybeans again in coming weeks despite the trade war between the two countries as other regions cannot supply enough soybeans to meet China’s needs, Hamburg-based oilseeds analysts Oil World said on Tuesday. In July, China imposed import tariffs on a list of U.S. goods, including soybeans, as part of the trade dispute with the United States. China is the world’s largest soybean importer and has been seeking alternative supplies, especially in South America, where supplies available for export are down. “China has to resume purchases of U.S. soybeans,” Oil World said in its latest newsletter. “The South American supply shortage will make it necessary for China, in our opinion, to import 15 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans in October 2018/March 2019, even if the current trade war is not resolved.” Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans could re-start “in coming weeks,” Oil World added. Soybeans, crushed to make cooking oil and the protein-rich animal feed ingredient soymeal, were the biggest U.S. agriculture export to China last year at a value of $12.3 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Oil World said with South American export supplies expected to be down sizeably from a year earlier in the next six months, China will face very tight domestic soybean supplies unless it resumes large-scale purchases of U.S. soybeans. “There is a risk that China will have to cut back its livestock production, implying higher prices on the domestic market,” it said. China is also likely to raise imports of processed soymeal as an alternative to soybeans for crushing, it said. Ironically this could mean China could still end up with U.S. soybeans that have been processed in Argentina. “The biggest increase is likely to be seen in soymeal exports from Argentina to China,” it said. “If China begins purchasing Argentine soymeal, a lack of soybean supplies in Argentina is likely to raise Argentine imports of U.S. soybeans.” (Reporting by Michael Hogan, editing by Jane Merriman)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/soybeans-us-china/china-may-have-to-resume-u-s-soybean-purchases-in-weeks-oil-world-idUKL5N1UX3I8,07 Aug 2018,"China may have to start buying

2018-08-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain should offer developers of mini nuclear plants subsidies similar to those made available to the offshore wind industry, an independent review commissioned by the government said on Tuesday. Britain needs to invest in new power generating capacity to replace aging coal and nuclear plants that are due to close in the 2020s, and is seeking more low carbon options to help meet its emission reduction targets. The government has been investigating whether mini nuclear plans – so called small modular reactors (SMR) – could offer a solution, and whether the industry could help boost much needed exports as Britain leaves the European Union. The government “should establish an advanced manufacturing supply chain initiative (as it did with offshore wind) to bring forward existing and new manufacturing capability,” said the report by the Expert Finance Working Group on Small Nuclear Reactors. Government support for offshore wind has enabled that industry to drive down costs, and reduce subsidies. The report also said the nascent SMR industry could provide a boost for British manufacturing and exports. “There is a real short-term opportunity for the UK as supply chains are yet to be established for small nuclear projects (unlike large nuclear with established supply chains largely outside the UK),” the report said. Rolls Royce (RR.L) which hopes to build SMRs in Britain as part of a consortium, said the export market could be worth as much as 400 billion pounds. SMRs use existing or new nuclear technology scaled down to a fraction of the size of larger plants and would be able to produce around a tenth of the electricity created by large-scale projects. The mini plants, which could be deployed by 2030 according to the review, would be made in factories, with parts small enough to be transported on trucks and barges where they could be assembled much more quickly than their large-scale counterparts. Britain’s nuclear energy minister Richard Harrington said the government would consider the review’s findings. The review “recognises the opportunity presented by small nuclear reactors and shows the potential for how investors, industry and Government can work together to make small nuclear reactors a reality,” he said in a statement. Rolls-Royce has launched a bid to build SMRs as part of a UK consortium with Amec Foster Wheeler AMFW.L, Nuvia, Arup and Laing O’Rourke, with the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre. Another group to express an interest is NuScale, majority owned by U.S. group Fluor Corp (FLR.N).

2018-08-07,"* World shares near 6-month high as China shines * Turkish lira bounces after Monday drubbing, but still shaky * Euro, pound tick higher as dollar eases * Oil prices push higher on Iran sanctions, supply signals * Benchmark bond yields tick up as demand for safety ebbs By Marc Jones LONDON, Aug 7 (Reuters) - World shares edged toward a six-month high on Tuesday, as the biggest jump in Chinese stocks for over two years and a sharp rally in Europe’s oil and mining firms set Wall Street up for more gains. The moves had U.S. S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq futures pointing as much as 0.4 percent higher and came despite a host of simmering global feuds. Oil prices ticked up as the United States reimposed some sanctions on Iran, while the Turkish lira was trying to bounce back from its worst day in a decade on Monday that had been prompted by a row with Washington. The mood lifted overnight as Chinese stocks rebounded 2.7 percent on hopes of fresh government spending, following a four-day selloff that had knocked them down about 6 percent. London, Paris and Frankfurt then rose 0.8 to 0.9 percent as Europe’s investors cheered both the move up in commodity stocks and results from Italy’s biggest bank UniCredit “The Chinese have stabilised the yuan, the lira hasn’t been annihilated this morning so once the sharp FX moves have calmed down and as long as the (company) earnings are good, you have a more risk friendly environment,” said Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes. Currency markets remained volatile although less so than in recent sessions as the dollar dipped. The euro bounced to $1.16 from a near six-week low despite a second day of disappointing German economic data, while Britain’s pound made back some ground after Brexit worries had pushed it to an 11-month low. Turkey’s lira recovered as much as two percent from Monday’s losses of more than five percent after Washington had moved to end duty-free access to U.S. markets for some Turkish exports. A report by CNN Turk that Turkish officials would go to Washington to discuss the strained relations helped the rise, although it was starting to retrace again as U.S. trading began. Already struggling with inflation at 14-year highs near 16 percent and political pressure on the central bank not to raise interest rates, the lira’s year-to-date losses are nearing 30 percent as jitters about foreign currency debt payments rise. “Currently the impact of the lira’s slide is mostly contained within the country. But fears of a default will begin to increase if the currency keeps depreciating,” said Kota Hirayama, senior emerging markets economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. “Such a development could affect some European financial institutions,” he added. An impressive global earnings picture and upgrades to the U.S. profit growth horizon continued to outweigh the global trade tensions and the various emerging market dislocations. Wall Street’s S&P 500 will start at its highest level since Jan. 29 and less than one percent from its record high hit earlier that month. The VIX volatility gauge is now at its lowest since late January too, while a surge in U.S. corporate earnings driven by tax cuts - they achieved an annual aggregate growth rate of about 25 percent in the second quarter - has prompted the likes of Citi to upgrade their end-2018 and 2019 earnings forecasts. That renewed traction has buoyed market sentiment around the world, with Tokyo and Seoul both up 0.6 percent and Hong Kong closing up more than 1.5 percent along with Shanghai’s big bounce. In commodities, oil extended the previous day’s rally after the imposition of U.S. sanctions against major crude exporter Iran took effect on Tuesday. Benchmark Brent crude oil futures shook off earlier weakness and were 1.5 percent higher at $74.80 a barrel. They had gained 0.75 percent on Monday after OPEC sources also said Saudi production had unexpectedly fallen in July. On bond markets, borrowing costs for euro zone benchmark issuer Germany were edging off their lowest levels in almost two weeks as sidelined concerns about global trade and turbulence in Italy eased demand for the least risky assets. The softer dollar helped metals. Copper was up 0.5 percent at $6,161.50 a tonne after retreating more than 1 percent the previous day. Gold, which is stuck near a one-year low, crawled 0.2 percent higher to $1,208.06 an ounce Additional reporting by Helen Reid in London; editing by

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: India's imports of U.S. crude catch those of China: tmsnrt.rs/2vpbSCa By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Aug 7 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil producers appear to have found an alternative buyer for cargoes no longer heading to China, with India on track to import record volumes in August. India has booked a total of 9.94 million barrels of crude, about 319,000 barrels per day (bpd), to arrive from the United States this month, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts. This would be almost triple the 119,000 bpd India imported from the United States in July, and well above the 190,000 bpd for November last year, the previous record for a month. The August total is also likely to be just above the 9.65 million barrels imported over the first seven months, showing the scale of acceleration in India’s imports of U.S. crude. Indian refiners’ interest in U.S. crude will be welcome news to shale producers looking for buyers outside of China, which is likely to scale back imports as the trade dispute between the administration of President Donald Trump and Beijing escalates. Although not imposed as yet, China has proposed import taxes of up to 25 percent on U.S. crude, as well as on liquefied natural gas and coal. While U.S. crude exports to China appear to have held up in August, with about 342,000 bpd expected to arrive, they seem set for a slump in September. So far, about 203,000 bpd of U.S. crude have been booked for arrival in China next month, according to vessel-tracking data, and the window for more cargoes to be added is closing, given it takes at least three weeks for a tanker to make the journey from the Gulf of Mexico to China’s east coast. For U.S. crude exporters, India is a market ripe for expansion, given the voyage from the Gulf of Mexico to India’s west coast takes about three weeks, much the same as it does to China’s east coast. This means shipping costs are more or less in line with sending cargoes to China. Indian refiners may also be seeking alternative suppliers as they may be compelled to cut purchases from Iran. Iranian oil exports are under a cloud because of renewed sanctions as part of the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the international agreement aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear programme. It must be especially galling for Tehran’s leaders that they stand to lose market share in India to the United States. However, there is no sign yet that India is cutting back on imports from Iran, with a record 768,000 bpd arriving in July, according to preliminary tanker data. It’s likely, though, that the 29 percent surge in imports from June was a result of Indian refiners buying as much as they could before they have to cut back as the renewed sanctions come into force. Still, Indian refiners are believed to be encountering difficulties in insuring cargoes from Iran, and Tehran is offering to insure vessels itself, as well as providing generous payment and freight terms. Whether this will allow Iran to keep exporting to India remains to be seen, but Tehran will be especially keen to keep its relationship with its second-biggest customer after China. The expected paring of India’s imports from Iran after this month and the increase in purchases from the United States also raise questions about the politics of oil. India is the world’s third-largest crude importer, and if it cuts its purchases from Iran, another likely major beneficiary besides the United States is Tehran’s regional rival and Trump ally Saudi Arabia. India imported about 970,000 bpd from Saudi Arabia in July, according to the vessel-tracking data, a figure that is considerably higher than the average of 787,100 bpd for the first six months of 2018. While it’s likely that Saudi Arabia is keen to limit Iran’s influence in the Middle East, it appears the kingdom could also be in for a double-whammy benefit of increasing its exports to fill the gap left by Iran and selling at higher prices, assuming the market tightens on the loss of Iranian barrels.

2018-08-07,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany is considering tighter controls on foreign investments as concerns over Chinese takeovers of strategically important technology firms mount. Berlin wants the power to investigate if an investor outside the European Union buys at least 15 percent of certain German defence-related or security-linked technology firms, an Economy Ministry source said on Tuesday. Germany tightened controls on foreign investments last year after a series of high-profile takeovers by Chinese companies, making it possible for the government to intervene if a buyer amassed a shareholding of 25 percent. And the German government last week signalled it was prepared to use a new power to veto foreign takeovers of German companies in the case of a Chinese bid for toolmaker Leifeld. This came after Leifeld’s majority owner Georg Koffler said China’s Yantai Taihai had dropped its attempt to buy the company ahead of an expected veto by the German government. The source did not name specific companies but said sensitive sectors included operators of critical infrastructure like cloud computing, drinking water suppliers and sewage disposal systems, systems of cash supply, hospital information systems, air traffic systems and local public transport. Last month, a German state bank bought a stake in high-voltage grid operator 50Hertz to prevent China’s state grid acquiring the shareholding and promised to consider ways of better protecting companies from foreign acquisition. The Economy Ministry should now be able to investigate if a non-EU investor acquires a shareholding of at least 15 percent of voting rights in the companies concerned, the source said. German newspaper Die Welt first reported the proposal to change the German Foreign Trade Ordinance, said it was being coordinated with other ministries and added that a law that provides for more control could come into effect this year. “Until now we’ve only been able to make checks when at least 25 percent of a company’s shares have been acquired. Now we want to lower this threshold so we can review more acquisitions in sensitive economic sectors,” Die Welt quoted German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier as saying. In Germany and other countries including the United States, France, Australia and Britain, there are concerns that China and other rivals are gaining access to key technologies via takeovers. Members of the European Parliament are nearing agreement on a proposal that would broaden the powers of the European Commission to scrutinize foreign investments amid rising concern about Chinese acquisitions on the continent. Joachim Lang, managing director of Germany’s BDI industry association, sounded cautious about the plans, saying foreign investment was important for Germany and the investment climate needed to remain open. He said the government needed to proceed in a “measured” way in amending the German Foreign Trade Ordinance but it was good that the government wanted to make conditions clear because investors needed legal certainty. “Lowering the investigation threshold must be limited to sensitive security-related areas and must be strictly oriented towards protecting national security,” Lang added. The head of Germany’s domestic intelligence service has said that Chinese state actors seeking trade secrets could be behind bids that nominally came from private firms, highlighting a seeming correlation between a decline in hacking attempts originating from China with an increase in bids.

2018-08-07,"NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - India doubled the import tax on more than 300 textile products to 20 percent on Tuesday as the world’s biggest producer of cotton tries to curb rising imports from China. It was the second tax hike on textiles in as many months after an increase on other products including fiber and apparels last month. The moves are expected to provide relief to the domestic textile industry, which has been hit by cheaper imports. India’s total textile imports jumped by 16 percent to a record $7 billion in the fiscal year to March 2018. Of this, about $3 billion were from China. The government did not disclose details of the 328 textile products that will be subject to the duty increase announced on Tuesday. Rising imports sent India’s trade deficit with China in textile products to a record high $1.54 billion in 2017/18, alarming industry officials as India had been until recently a net exporter of textile products to China. Sanjay Jain, president of the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry, told Reuters he did not expect China to retaliate to the Indian duty increases as it still has a trade surplus with India. He said India’s textile product imports could fall to $6 billion in 2018/19 as a result of the tax hike to 20 percent. India’s imports of textile products from Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia also jumped in the last few years as they are not subject to any duty under free trade agreements (FTA) signed by India with these countries. The 20 percent duty will not be applicable to products sourced from those countries due to the FTA, Jain said. Industry officials say in the last few months Chinese fiber has been shipped to Bangladesh and processed and exported to India with zero duty. “Rules of origin need to be implemented for textile products. Otherwise Chinese products will land from other countries,” said a Mumbai-based garment exporter, who declined to be named. Jain said India’s textile and garment exports could rise 8 percent to $40 billion in 2018/19 due to a weak rupee and as the government is expected to introduce incentives to boost overseas sales. India’s trade differences with the United States have also been rising since President Donald Trump took office. India, the world’s biggest buyer of U.S. almonds, in June decided to raise import duties on almonds and some other U.S. imports by 20 percent, joining the European Union and China in retaliating against Trump’s tariff hikes on steel and aluminum. The increased tariff on U.S. goods will be applicable from Sept. 18.

2018-08-07,"DUBAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco and Malaysia’s Petronas have approached banks to replace a short-term $8 billion loan raised earlier this year for a joint venture with long-term financing of approximately the same size, banking sources familiar with the matter said. The two state energy companies borrowed $8 billion (6.2 billion pounds) from a large consortium of international banks in March for a refinery and petrochemical joint venture in the southern Malaysian state of Johor. The project, Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID), is a $27 billion (20.8 billion pounds) complex located between the Malacca Strait and the South China Sea, conduits for Middle East oil and gas bound for China, Japan and South Korea. The two firms issued a request for proposals to banks last month and are now in preliminary discussions for a self-arranged loan with a maturity of more than 10 years which would replace the existing bridge borrowing, said the sources.  Aramco IPO-ARAM.SE declined to comment. Petronas did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A group of 19 banks participated in the bridge loan, including Asian lenders and BNP Paribas, HSBC, JPMorgan, Standard Chartered, Citibank, First Abu Dhabi Bank and ING Bank. That loan, which had a 364-day tenor and an extension option of six months, offered a margin interest rate of around 40 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor), Thomson Reuters’ LPC reported in March. Aramco and Petronas finalised the deal to invest in the project in March saying at the time that Aramco would supply 50 percent of the refinery’s crude oil with an option of increasing it to 70 percent. Refinery operations are set to begin in 2019, with petrochemical operations to follow 6-12 months afterwards. Aramco plans to boost investments in refining and petrochemicals to secure new markets and sees growth in chemicals as central to its downstream strategy to cut the risk of an oil demand slowdown. Aramco is also expected to tap banks for a huge financing that would back the potential acquisition of a controlling stake in petrochemical maker SABIC 2010.SE, banking sources said separately. Aramco could possibly take the entire 70 percent holding owned by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund in SABIC, sources told Reuters last month. Bankers are weighing a number of options for the potential deal, which could go up to $70 billion, but there has been so far no formal request from Aramco, several sources familiar with the matter said. Aramco, which pumps around 10 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, plans to raise its refining capacity to between 8 million and 10 million bpd, from around 5 million bpd now, and double its petrochemicals production by 2030.

2018-08-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - A new race to build multi-billion dollar liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants is gaining momentum after a long hiatus in investments as energy giants sense a widening supply gap within five years.  Spending on new, complex facilities that super-chill gas into liquid in order to allow its transportation dried up following the collapse in energy prices in 2014.  Appetite was further dampened by fears that a plethora of LNG plants built since the late 2000s would lead to a large supply glut until early in the next decade. But sentiment has radically changed over the past year. Buoyed by rising oil prices and exceptionally strong demand from rapidly growing economies such as China and India, executives are increasingly confident conditions are once again ripe for new projects.  Qatar, the world’s largest LNG producer, is preparing to expand its facilities by around one third to produce 100-108 million tonnes per year (mtpa) by 2023-2024.  “The glut that people see I don’t see ... If you just count on being pessimistic about the market, and don’t build expansions, you will never catch that upside when the market is up,” Saad al-Kaabi, the head of Qatar Petroleum, told Reuters in May. The state-owned company expects long-standing partners Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS), Total (TOTF.PA) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) to help build and fund the new expansion phases as well as possibly new entrants, he said. A major change in the outlook happened after China strongly boosted imports of LNG in recent years to reduce coal burn in its fight against pollution.      “The supply-demand balance definitely looks more favourable towards producers these days,” said Philippe Sauquet, the head of gas at France’s Total, the world’s second largest LNG trader after Shell. “China will continue to make the real difference in demand. I don’t see them slowing down. They are shifting attention to building more and more infrastructure,” Sauquet told Reuters. (Graphic: LNG supply and demand - tmsnrt.rs/2mQuxSY) The LNG market will require over 200 million tonnes per year of new supply through to 2030, or roughly 25-30 mtpa per year in new capacity additions to 2025, according to Bernstein. “We believe 60 mtpa needs to be sanctioned by 2020 and a further 100+ mtpa between 2020-2025 to ensure markets are adequately supplied,” Bernstein said.  Liquefaction capacity additions are expected to fall sharply by the end of 2019 as newly commissioned plants reach their maximum capacity, according to Bernstein. The main source of growth is expected to come from the United States, where supplies rose sharply and prices plummeted with the expansion of shale drilling. Investors were highly critical of oil and gas companies earlier this decade as costs ballooned for many LNG projects under development such as Chevron’s $54 billion Gorgon project in western Australia, the most expensive in history, or Shell’s $14 billion (£10.80 billion) Prelude LNG, the world’s largest floating structure. But with services costs still languishing in the wake of the 2014 slump and new technologies helping to simplify and improve designs, new projects are able to compete for capital.  Executives also say they have learnt from past mistakes. The renewed confidence in the outlook for LNG and the recovery in oil prices that has led to a surge in revenue for energy companies, boards are getting ready to invest. Exxon last year bought for $2.8 billion a 25 percent stake in Eni’s Rovuma development in Mozambique, which holds a massive estimated resource of 85 trillion cubic feet. Speaking to Reuters, Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi said partners in the project, Exxon, Korea Gas Corp (036460.KS) and China National Petroleum Corporation [CNPET.UL], will take a final investment decision next year so it could be operational by 2023-2024. The project will produce 15 million tonnes of LNG per year, or 5 percent of global output. Shell, which acquired BG Group in 2016 for $54 billion to boost its gas output, is nearing a decision on the development of LNG Canada. It would be its first new LNG project since 2011. “We expect a supply gap in the gas market in the early 2020s ... LNG Canada looks very promising,” Shell Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl said last month.  Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said the Anglo-Dutch company expects the partners in the Nigeria LNG processing plant, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Shell, Total and Eni, to consider its expansion by the end of the year to increase its capacity to 30 mtpa. Shell’s British rival BP (BP.L) and its partner Kosmos Energy (KOS.N) will decide on the development of the Tortue field off the coast of Senegal and Mauritania by next year. Global demand for LNG surged by 12 percent in 2017, far exceeding forecasts, and is expected to grow by up to 10 percent in 2018, according to analysts at Bernstein. Oil and gas companies have heralded LNG as the fossil fuel of the future thanks to its relatively low carbon emissions. Natural gas, the least polluting fossil fuel, is a key growth area for energy companies which see it playing a pivotal role in the world’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight global warming. For companies like Shell and BP, the share of gas production has surpassed that of oil in recent years.

2018-08-07,"(Adds CFO comments on outlook, prices) PRAGUE, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Czech power producer CEZ partly blamed exceptional gains a year ago for a collapse in its second-quarter net profit on Tuesday and said its business should now start to pick up as prices are on the rise. CEZ, like many European utilities, has seen profit squeezed in recent years by depressed whole electricity prices. The majority state-owned company maintained its full-year profit outlook after reporting a 93 percent slump in second-quarter adjusted net profit and its chief financial officer said 2018 results should be “the bottom” of the cycle. Much of the second-quarter earnings drop was due to gains booked in the same period a year ago from the sale of shares held in Hungarian oil and gas group MOL and real estate in the Czech Republic, it said. For the full year CEZ has forecast that adjusted net income would fall by up to 42 percent to between 12 billion crowns ($543 million) and 14 billion crowns. “We are comfortable with this range so far and we think we should get there,” Chief Financial Officer Martin Novak told reporters. CEZ also forecast EBITDA to fall slightly in 2018 to 51 billion to 53 billion crowns, down from 53.9 billion crowns posted in 2017. In the second quarter, adjusted net income, which strips out extraordinary items, fell to 0.6 billion crowns ($27.09 million), well below an average estimate of 2.4 billion crowns in a Reuters poll of analysts. Quarterly revenue slipped to 40.9 billion crowns, versus the average estimate of 44.4 billion crowns in the poll. Hedging of contracts for delivery in the second half meant that rising spot power prices dented first-half earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) by 1.2 billion crowns. However, same amount will be compensated for in the second half when deliveries will be made at higher prices than the hedges, Novak said. The company’s strategy of pre-selling expected output means that rising market prices on the back of increasing CO2 allowance prices will not be seen in earnings until later. CEZ said it had pre-sold 77 percent of its 2019 output at an average price of 32.8 euros per megawatt hour, up from a previous average price of 31.5 euros last quarter when it had sold already 71 percent. CEZ contracts 48 percent of 2020 power at an average price of 36.1 euro per MwH. “We can clearly see that the trend is turning, our prices for the coming years are beginning to rise,” Novak said. “We think that this year should be the bottom of our results.” ($1 = 22.1520 Czech crowns) Reporting by Jason Hovet and Robert Muller; Editing by Kirsten

Nicolas Breteau, who took over as CEO last month after his predecessor was fired, told reporters on a call that TP ICAP had spoken to regulators in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Paris before picking the French capital as its EU headquarters post-Brexit.

Lower volatility in financial markets has hurt the company as investors reined in risk-taking and stock markets racked up a decade of gains. TP ICAP said pre-tax profit fell 52 percent to 34 million pounds ($44.03 million) in the six months ended June. TP ICAP, however, said conditions in financial markets had been “supportive” in the first half, with an increase in equity volatility at the start of the year, helped by rises in the U.S. federal fund rate.

2018-08-07,"* World shares near 6-month high as China shares shine * Turkish lira bounces 1.7 pct after Monday drubbing * Euro, pound tick higher as dollar eases * Oil prices drift higher on Iran sanctions By Marc Jones LONDON, Aug 7 (Reuters) - World shares edged toward a six-month high on Tuesday, as the biggest jump in Chinese stocks for over two years and an upbeat start for Europe followed Wall Street’s best close since January. The moves came despite a host of simmering global feuds. Oil prices ticked higher as the United States reimposed some sanctions on Iran, while the Turkish lira bounced back almost 2 percent from its worst day in a decade on Monday that had been prompted by a row with Washington. The mood lifted overnight as Chinese stocks rebounded 2.7 percent on hopes of fresh government spending, following a four-day selloff that had knocked them down about 6 percent. London, Paris and Frankfurt followed by rising 0.6 to 0.9 percent as Europe’s investors cheered results from Italy’s biggest bank UniCredit and oil firms and miners gained on the rise in crude prices. “The Chinese have stabilised the yuan, the lira hasn’t been annihilated this morning so once the sharp FX moves have calmed down and as long as the (company) earnings are good, you have a more risk friendly environment,” said Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes. Currency markets remained volatile although less so than in recent sessions as the dollar dipped. The euro bounced to $1.1583 from a near six-week low despite a second day of disappointing German economic data, while Britain’s pound made back some ground after Brexit worries had pushed it to an 11-month low. Turkey’s lira recovered 1.7 percent from Monday’s losses of more than 5 percent after Washington had moved to end duty-free access to U.S. markets for some Turkish exports. A report by CNN Turk that Turkish officials would go to Washington to discuss the strained relations helped the rise, although the lira remains close to a record low. Already struggling with inflation at 14-year highs near 16 percent and political pressure on the central bank not to raise interest rates, the lira’s year-to-date losses are nearing 30 percent as jitters about foreign currency debt payments rise. “Currently the impact of the lira’s slide is mostly contained within the country. But fears of a default will begin to increase if the currency keeps depreciating,” said Kota Hirayama, senior emerging markets economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. “Such a development could affect some European financial institutions,” he added. An impressive global earnings picture and upgrades to the U.S. profit growth horizon outweighed the global trade tensions and the various emerging market dislocations. Wall Street’s S&P 500 closed at its highest level since Jan. 29 overnight, less than 1 percent from its record high hit earlier that month. The Vix volatility gauge closed at its lowest since Jan. 26. A surge in U.S. corporate earnings driven by tax cuts - they achieved an annual aggregate growth rate of about 25 percent in the second quarter - has prompted the likes of Citi to upgrade their end-2018 and 2019 earnings forecasts. Wall Street buoyed market sentiment around the world, with Tokyo and Seoul both up 0.6 percent and Hong Kong closing up more than 1 percent along with Shanghai’s big bounce. In commodities, oil extended the previous day’s rally after the imposition of U.S. sanctions against major crude exporter Iran took effect on Tuesday. Benchmark Brent crude oil futures shook off earlier weakness and were 0.33 percent higher at $73.99 a barrel. They had gained 0.75 percent on Monday after OPEC sources said Saudi production had unexpectedly fallen in July. On bond markets, borrowing costs for euro zone benchmark issuer Germany were pinned near their lowest levels in almost two weeks as concerns about global trade and turbulence in Italy continued to support demand for the least risky assets. The softer dollar helped metals. Copper was up 0.5 percent at $6,161.50 a tonne after retreating more than 1 percent the previous day. Gold, which is stuck near a one-year low, crawled 0.2 percent higher to $1,208.06 an ounce (Additional reporting by Helen Reid in London; editing by David Stamp)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-markets/global-markets-china-bounce-pushes-world-shares-toward-6-month-high-idUKL5N1UY244,07 Aug 2018,"World shares edged toward a

2018-08-07,"(Repeats Aug. 6 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2LZzVkT By John Kemp LONDON, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Fund managers are rebuilding a big bullish position in U.S. gasoline futures and options - even as they remain on the sidelines across other petroleum contracts. Hedge funds and other money managers raised their combined net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices by 22 million barrels in the week to July 31 (tmsnrt.rs/2LZzVkT). Net position changes were small in Brent (+5 million barrels), NYMEX and ICE WTI (-5 million barrels), U.S. heating oil (+3 million barrels) and European gasoil (+5 million barrels). But portfolio managers raised their net long position in U.S. gasoline by 15 million barrels, after increasing it by 11 million barrels the week before. Funds’ long positions in gasoline outnumber shorts by 105 million barrels, up from a recent low of 78 million at the end of June. Positioning has become exceptionally stretched, with bullish long positions outnumbering bearish short ones by more than 25:1. In other contracts, however, hedge fund activity has remained subdued over the last two weeks, after heavy liquidation in the middle of July. Long positions remain very high (1.16 billion barrels), but well below the record set at the start of the year (1.63 billion). Short positions continue to trend downward and now amount to only 110 million barrels in total across all six contracts, just 1 million barrels above multi-year lows. With the exception of gasoline, fund managers may have become less convinced prices will rise further - but few are willing to bet that they will pull back significantly.

2018-08-07,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil producers appear to have found an alternative buyer for cargoes no longer heading to China, with India on track to import record volumes in August. India has booked a total of 9.94 million barrels of crude, about 319,000 barrels per day (bpd), to arrive from the United States this month, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts. This would be almost triple the 119,000 bpd India imported from the United States in July, and well above the 190,000 bpd for November last year, the previous record for a month. The August total is also likely to be just above the 9.65 million barrels imported over the first seven months, showing the scale of acceleration in India’s imports of U.S. crude. Indian refiners’ interest in U.S. crude will be welcome news to shale producers looking for buyers outside of China, which is likely to scale back imports as the trade dispute between the administration of President Donald Trump and Beijing escalates. Although not imposed as yet, China has proposed import taxes of up to 25 percent on U.S. crude, as well as on liquefied natural gas and coal. While U.S. crude exports to China appear to have held up in August, with about 342,000 bpd expected to arrive, they seem set for a slump in September. So far, about 203,000 bpd of U.S. crude have been booked for arrival in China next month, according to vessel-tracking data, and the window for more cargoes to be added is closing, given it takes at least three weeks for a tanker to make the journey from the Gulf of Mexico to China’s east coast. For U.S. crude exporters, India is a market ripe for expansion, given the voyage from the Gulf of Mexico to India’s west coast takes about three weeks, much the same as it does to China’s east coast. This means shipping costs are more or less in line with sending cargoes to China. Indian refiners may also be seeking alternative suppliers as they may be compelled to cut purchases from Iran. Iranian oil exports are under a cloud because of renewed sanctions as part of the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the international agreement aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear programme. It must be especially galling for Tehran’s leaders that they stand to lose market share in India to the United States. However, there is no sign yet that India is cutting back on imports from Iran, with a record 768,000 bpd arriving in July, according to preliminary tanker data. (Graphic: India's imports of U.S. crude catch those of China: tmsnrt.rs/2vpbSCa) It’s likely, though, that the 29 percent surge in imports from June was a result of Indian refiners buying as much as they could before they have to cut back as the renewed sanctions come into force. Still, Indian refiners are believed to be encountering difficulties in insuring cargoes from Iran, and Tehran is offering to insure vessels itself, as well as providing generous payment and freight terms. Whether this will allow Iran to keep exporting to India remains to be seen, but Tehran will be especially keen to keep its relationship with its second-biggest customer after China. The expected paring of India’s imports from Iran after this month and the increase in purchases from the United States also raise questions about the politics of oil. India is the world’s third-largest crude importer, and if it cuts its purchases from Iran, another likely major beneficiary besides the United States is Tehran’s regional rival and Trump ally Saudi Arabia. India imported about 970,000 bpd from Saudi Arabia in July, according to the vessel-tracking data, a figure that is considerably higher than the average of 787,100 bpd for the first six months of 2018. While it’s likely that Saudi Arabia is keen to limit Iran’s influence in the Middle East, it appears the kingdom could also be in for a double-whammy benefit of increasing its exports to fill the gap left by Iran and selling at higher prices, assuming the market tightens on the loss of Iranian barrels.

The measure is expected to reduce power charges for the average household from state-run utility Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO) by 19.5 percent, Paik Un-gyu, Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy said on Tuesday. The move comes as sweltering summer heat has sparked a public backlash over KEPCO’s progressive electricity billing system, under which households pay higher rates for power as usage increases. Paik said the government would also look at longer-term changes. “This is a temporary measure against a disaster level-heatwave,” he told a news briefing. “We will discuss with parliament and devise measures to reform the overall electricity billing system.” Under the current system, residential users are bracketed in three bands, and pay bills depending on the amount of electricity consumption. The minimum rate is charged at below 200 kilowatts per hour (kWh), but this will be raised to below 300 KWh for July and August, the energy ministry said. The system has already been revamped from a six-band tariff two years ago, after residential users complained they were afraid to turn up their air conditioners for fear of heavy bills. Paik said the government would look at sharing the cost of the temporary relief with KEPCO to ease costs for the firm, which supplies all of the country’s household electricity. The ministry said the country’s power supply was currently sufficient to meet demand.

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open slightly higher, with Britain’s FTSE rising 0.1 percent, Germany’s DAX advancing 0.15 percent and France’s CAC adding 0.13 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.35 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.4 percent as investors snapped up shares that were hit hard during a four-day losing run. Chinese equities were expected to remain volatile as Beijing’s trade feud with Washington showed little signs of de-escalation. South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.3 percent and Japan’s Nikkei added 0.6 percent. The three major U.S. stock indexes closed higher on Monday amid a strong U.S. earnings season, with results from Berkshire Hathaway impressing and Facebook lifting the Nasdaq after a report it was planning new services. “Global markets are (being) buffeted by conflicting currents. The bottom-up view of the world from a corporate perspective is positive, led by U.S. companies,” wrote Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. “However, the increasing potential for trade disputes to slow the global economy is restraining investor enthusiasm.” The dollar drew support from the persistent international trade tensions.

2018-08-07,"BOGOTA, Aug 6 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Two dams being built in Guatemala have damaged the environment and local communities, according to a formal complaint by rights groups and indigenous leaders who urged the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to withdraw financing. The complaint filed on Monday alleges that construction of the Pojom II and San Andres hydroelectric dams, financed in part by $13 million from IDB, has polluted water sources for hundreds of indigenous Mayans in northern Huehuetenango province. “These communities depend on water for their livelihoods,” said Liliana Avila, a lawyer with the United States-based Interamerican Association for Environmental Defense (AIDA), one of the groups that submitted the complaint. “The construction of the dams has contaminated rivers, harmed the ability of communities to fish and grow crops and maintain their traditions,” she said by phone. The complaint was submitted to the Independent Consultation and Investigation Mechanism (MICI), an independent accountability body of the IDB, the Washington, D.C.-based multilateral lender. “We do not comment on any complaints filed or ongoing investigations,” said a spokesperson from IDB, which funds development projects throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Along with AIDA, the complaint was submitted by the International Platform Against Impunity, a group of rights organizations from the Netherlands, Switzerland and Central America, and indigenous leaders. The groups said polluted water from the dams has caused health problems among children, including skin rashes and diarrhea. The complaint, seen by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, says that communities living in the Ixquisis region in Huehuetenango were not properly consulted about the projects and their risks. Avila said the projects violate IDB’s own rules, “particularly its policies on environment and sustainability, indigenous people, gender, and information disclosure.” People in Ixquisis have protested the dams since 2014, and there have been almost 100 attacks and threats against them documented since then, said the complaint. The Pojom II dam is operated by Generadora San Mateo S.A, while San Andres is run by Generadora San Andres S.A., both of which are subsidiaries of the privately owned Promocion y Desarrollos Hidricos S.A., according to the complaint. The environmental impact assessments for the adjacent dam projects have been approved by Guatemala’s environment ministry. Avila said she was hopeful the IDB's accountability mechanism would decide within a month to accept the complaint and start an investigation.

2018-08-07,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia plans to require all diesel fuel used in the country contain biodiesel starting next month to boost palm oil consumption, slash fuel imports, and narrow a yawning current account gap. While the proposal has been welcomed by the palm oil industry and government, it has raised concerns among the automobile industry the fuel could impact engine performance. Environmentalists fear the boost to local palm oil consumption will hasten Indonesia’s already fast spreading deforestation. The following explains some of the issues surrounding the drive to increase biodiesel usage. Graphic: Indonesian oil imports: reut.rs/2vfmzan Indonesia currently imports around 400,000 barrels per day of crude oil and a roughly similar amount of refined products, which makes Southeast Asia’s largest economy vulnerable to the sort of increases in global crude prices seen over the past year. With the current account deficit estimated to grow by $8 billion in 2018, the plan is to cut diesel imports by mandating that all diesel consumers, including power plants and railways, use biodiesel that contains 20 percent bio-content (B20), typically palm oil. Officials estimate this will save Indonesia around $6 billion per year. Graphic: Indonesia's rupiah vs U.S.-dollar & current account balance as % of GDP (reut.rs/2LQFfHZ) The programme will increase domestic consumption of palm oil in the world’s largest producer of the edible oil, providing a market for output that has climbed by 35 percent over the past five years. In Indonesia, the bio component in biodiesel consists of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) made from palm oil. Indonesia has 26 FAME producers, including units of palm oil giants like Sinar Mas Group, Wilmar (WLIL.SI), and Musim Mas, according to the Indonesian Biofuels Producers Association (APROBI). FAME is supplied to fuel distributors including Pertamina, blended with petroleum-based diesel and sold to end-users. Graphic: Indonesia's energy sector in decline (reut.rs/2Mc915Y) Currently only around one-quarter of Indonesia’s FAME production capacity is utilised, and the new programme could raise this to up to 50 percent, said Togar Sitanggang, a senior official at the Indonesia Palm Oil Association (GAPKI).  The government has said it will provide incentives to biodiesel producers, but has not provided details. Efforts to increase FAME concentrations in biodiesel have faced resistance from regulators and the automotive and oil industries in the past.  Indonesia is supporting a programme to make 100-percent palm oil-based biodiesel without FAME. Rules introduced in 2015 make B20 mandatory in subsidised biodiesel up to January 2020, after which B30 is scheduled to become mandatory. While B20 use is generally accepted for new vehicles, higher FAME blends may pose problems. FAME has a solvent effect that can corrode engine seals and gaskets, potentially increasing maintenance costs, and requiring special handling and equipment. “High-level biodiesel blends can also impact engine warranties, gel in cold temperatures, and may present unique storage issues,” the U.S. Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) said on its website. Graphic: Indonesia biodiesel & palm oil industry in H1 2018 (reut.rs/2O5MHeM) According to the AFDC, the more FAME there is above 20 percent in biodiesel, the lower its energy content. FAME use could also increase nitrogen oxide emissions, although it greatly reduces other toxic emissions, it said. In a 2016 assessment, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) concluded that biodiesel with no more than 20 percent FAME content was acceptable for vehicles that comply with the Euro IV emissions standard, among other conditions. In a 2015 study by Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT), six passenger vehicles from three manufacturers were driven over 40,000 km (25,000 miles) using B20 biodiesel and regular diesel. The test found that B20 improved vehicle performance and acceleration, and reduced emissions, but the vehicles consumed roughly 4 percent more fuel than vehicles using regular diesel. Tatang Soerawidjaja, chairman of the Indonesian Association of Bioenergy Scientists and Technologists, said extensive tests have shown that B20 poses “no problems” for diesel engines, even in older models. Filters would only need replacement or more frequent cleaning in the early phase of adopting biodiesel use, he said, referring to FAME’s solvent effect when mixed with regular diesel. “The bio content cleans dirt off of the tank’s walls and pipes, and this ends up in the filter,” he said.

2018-08-07,"* U.S. sanctions to bite from 1201 EDT Tuesday * Washington wants other countries to cut Iran oil orders * Hot weather to start affecting oil demand - JPMorgan By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Oil markets started cautiously on Tuesday, as many traders in Asia were reluctant to take on new positions ahead of the introduction of U.S. sanctions against major crude exporter Iran. Spot Brent crude oil futures were at $73.74 per barrel at 0100 GMT on Tuesday, down 1 cent from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 8 cents at $68.93 barrel. U.S. sanctions against major oil exporter Iran are set to kick in at 12:01 a.m. U.S. Eastcoast time (0401 GMT) on Tuesday. Traders in Asia said they were holding back on making bets on oil ahead of European and U.S. trading hours, which tend to see much higher liquidity and stronger price movements. “The U.S. seems hell-bent on regime change in Iran and is reimposing sanctions at midnight Washington time as the 6th becomes the 7th of August,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader. Many other countries, including U.S. allies in Europe and also China and India oppose the introduction of new sanctions, but the U.S. government said it wants as many countries as possible to stop buying Iranian oil. “It is our policy to get as many countries to zero as quickly as possible. We are going to work with individual countries on a case by case basis, but our goal is to reduce the amount of revenue and hard currency going into Iran,” said a senior U.S. administration official on Monday. ANZ bank said a 24-hour strike at three North Sea oil and gas platforms operated by Total, which started at 0500 GMT on Monday, was also supporting prices. The main oil market price drivers of recent months have been output levels by top producers Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States, renewed Iran sanctions, the U.S. vs China trade dispute, and unplanned supply disruptions. Some analysts warned that a global heat wave could also now affect oil demand. Much of the northern hemisphere has been gripped by extreme heat this summer, pushing up demand for industrial and residential cooling. This mostly impacts demand for power fuels like thermal coal and natural gas. But U.S. bank JPMorgan said a warmer than usual fourth quarter, caused by a potential El Niño weather pattern, “can cause droughts, flooding and other natural disasters across the globe, including heatwaves in the U.S. that affect commodities.” “Past instances of El Niño have resulted in sharp drops in U.S. residential and commercial heating oil demand and prices,” it said.

2018-08-07,"Aug 6 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co (SoCalGas) on Monday raised the estimated cost for the massive leak at its Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in Los Angeles between October 2015 and February 2016 to $1.014 billion. That is up about up 6.3 percent from the company’s $954 million estimate last quarter, according to a quarterly report with U.S. financial regulators. SoCalGas, a unit of California energy company Sempra Energy , warned the “estimate may rise significantly” due to pending lawsuits, possible fines and other costs. It said costs not covered by insurance or delays in receiving insurance payments “could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas’s and Sempra Energy’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.” The utility said the latest estimate included $987 million of costs already recovered or likely to be recovered from insurance. It said about 55 percent of the total cost was for temporary relocation of residents who live near the facility, which is close to the Porter Ranch neighborhood in Los Angeles, including cleanup costs. Aliso Canyon, with a capacity of 86 billion cubic feet (bcf), is SoCalGas’ biggest storage facility. State regulators estimated 4.62 bcf of gas leaked at Aliso Canyon. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day. The facility represents 63 percent of the utility’s gas storage capacity, making it a key part of the company’s ability to deliver fuel to customers, especially on the coldest winter days when demand for heating is highest and the hottest summer days when a lot of gas is used to generate power for air conditioning. State regulators have limited the amount of gas SoCalGas can inject into Aliso Canyon to a total of 34 bcf. They have also said the company can only withdraw gas from the facility when other options are not available to meet demand. Many residents and government officials want SoCalGas to shut Aliso Canyon. The California Public Utilities Commission has said it expects to complete its evaluation under Senate Bill 380 by Nov. 14 to determine the impact of reducing or eliminating the use of Aliso Canyon.
