2019-02-12,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators from both parties introduced a resolution on Tuesday requiring that any deal to share U.S. nuclear power technology with Saudi Arabia block the kingdom from making a nuclear weapon.  Under the measure, any U.S. civilian nuclear cooperation agreement, or 123 agreement, with Saudi Arabia would prevent  enrichment of uranium or reprocessing of plutonium made in reactors - two routes to making nuclear weapons. It is unclear whether a majority of the 100-member Senate would support the resolution of Democrats Jeff Merkley and Ed Markey and Republican Rand Paul. The resolution is also non-binding on the U.S. government. But with significant support, it would signal concern in Congress over Saudi-led bombing campaigns in Yemen and over the killing of U.S.-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry has been holding quiet talks with officials from Saudi Arabia on sharing U.S. nuclear technology. U.S. President Donald Trump hosted nuclear power executives on Tuesday for talks on keeping the industry competitive on exports with France, China, and Russia.  The Trump administration is trying to advance nuclear energy technology domestically and abroad as the industry suffers from plentiful supplies of cheap natural gas and high safety costs at home. A resolution could pressure the administration to push for a deal with tougher standards. “If Saudi Arabia is going to get its hands on nuclear technology, it’s absolutely critical that we hold it to the gold standard for non-proliferation,” Merkley said in a release. “The last thing America should do is inadvertently help develop nuclear weapons for a bad actor on the world stage.” Riyadh has said it wants to be self-sufficient in producing nuclear fuel and that it is not interested in diverting nuclear technology to military use. But Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told CBS last year the kingdom will develop nuclear weapons if arch-rival Iran does.  In previous talks, Saudi Arabia has refused to sign an agreement with Washington that would deprive it of enriching uranium. The Saudi embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Last year Saudi Arabia put the United States on a shortlist with South Korea’s state-run utility KEPCO, along with France, China and Russia to bid for a nuclear power project. The winner will likely be selected in 2019. U.S. reactor builder Westinghouse, owned by Brookfield Asset Management Inc, would likely sell nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia in any deal. Chris Crane, president and chief operating officer of Exelon Corp, the largest U.S. nuclear power operator, told reporters Trump was supportive in Tuesday’s meeting with the executives but wanted them to clarify their expectations.   Crane was joined by Daniel Poneman, head of uranium enrichment company Centrus Energy Corp and deputy energy secretary under former President Barack Obama, and John Hopkins, head of NuScale Power, a company developing small modular reactors.

2019-02-12,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Electric Co booked the most orders for electricity-generating gas turbines in 2018 but fell to second place for the largest and most advanced machines, behind Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems, according to a closely watched report seen by Reuters and people familiar with the matter. Demand for gas turbines has been tumbling since 2011, stoking fierce competition for deals and prompting manufacturers to slash jobs and close factories. GE is in the midst of a multi-year restructuring of its power business, which lost $808 million last year. The latest rankings show Mitsubishi won 41 percent of the orders last year for turbines that can produce 100 megawatts or more, compared with 28 percent for GE and 25 percent for Siemens AG, according to McCoy Power Reports data.  Among newest-generation turbines, known as “post F-class,” MHPS got 49 percent of orders, compared with 34 percent for GE and 16 percent for Siemens, the data shows.      Orders for the most advanced turbines have dwindled along with the entire market, even though they churn out the most electricity per unit of fuel burned. GE suffered a high-profile breakdown with one of its advanced turbines in Texas last year, and warned it may spend $480 million on repairs for the global fleet. GE last year held onto its longtime top spot when all orders were counted.  The rankings show GE dominated orders for older-technology F-class turbines and that it had an overall tally of 33 percent of orders by capacity, compared with 31 percent for MHPS and 26 percent for Siemens. GE is “proud to the leader ... as it has been every year since 2010,” spokeswoman Kirstin Carvell said. Siemens did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Mitsubishi said in a statement on Tuesday that its ranking largely reflected orders for its new J-Series turbine, which the company said has greater than 64 percent efficiency and 99.5 percent reliability.

2019-02-12,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he could let the March 1 deadline for a trade agreement with China “slide for a little while,” but that he would prefer not to and expects to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping to close the deal at some point. U.S. tariffs on $200 billion (155 billion pounds) worth of imports from China are scheduled to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent if the two sides cannot reach a deal by the deadline, increasing pain and costs in sectors from consumer electronics to agriculture. Trump’s advisers have previously described March 1 as a “hard deadline,” but Trump told reporters for the first time that a delay was now possible. “If we’re close to a deal where we think we can make a real deal and it’s going to get done, I could see myself letting that slide for a little while,” Trump said of the deadline at a White House cabinet meeting. “But generally speaking, I’m not inclined to do that.” “We’re doing very well over in China,” Trump added. A growing number of U.S. businesses and lawmakers have expressed hopes for a delay in the tariff increase while the two sides tackle the difficult U.S. demands for major “structural” policy changes by China aimed at ending the forced transfer of American trade secrets, curbing Beijing’s industrial subsidies and enforcing intellectual property rights. Senator Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, said he discussed the U.S.-China talks with U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer last week, and added that he thought the talks were “constructive and serious.” “I think they’re making progress and my hope is that by March 1 there will be enough progress to be made that at a minimum, there could be a delay in the imposition of additional tariffs,” Portman told reporters. Portman, who served as USTR during the George W. Bush administration, added that the Trump administration “is committed to structural reforms at this point” and Trump is less likely to settle for a deal mainly focused on increased purchases of U.S. commodities. Erin Ennis, senior vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said more time may be needed for a deal, which will require a meeting between Trump and his Chinese counterpart to complete. “What I am sensing is there is a strong desire on both sides to reach an agreement,” she added. Trump said last week he did not plan to meet with Xi before the March 1 deadline.   U.S. stocks rallied on Trump’s trade comments, along with a tentative congressional spending deal aimed at avoiding another government shutdown. All three major indexes posted their biggest one-day gains for the month so far, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average snapping a four-day losing streak to rise 1.5 percent and the S&P 500 gaining 1.3 percent. Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin arrived in Beijing on Tuesday and are scheduled to hold talks on Thursday and Friday with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, the top economic adviser to Xi.  “We’re looking forward to several important days of talks,” Mnuchin told reporters after arriving at a Beijing hotel.  Lighthizer, who arrived at the hotel earlier in the day, did not answer reporters’ questions.  The latest round of talks in Beijing kicked off on Monday  with discussions among deputy-level officials to try to work out technical details, including a mechanism for enforcing any trade agreement. A round of talks at the end of January ended with some progress reported, but no deal and U.S. declarations that much more work was needed.

2019-02-12,"Feb 12 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc and General Motors Co are in talks to invest in Rivian Automotive LLC in a deal that will value the U.S. electric pickup truck manufacturer at between $1 billion and $2 billion, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. The deal would give Amazon and General Motors minority stakes in Rivian, the sources said. It would be a major boost for the Plymouth, Michigan-based startup, which aspires to be the first car maker to the U.S. market with an electric pickup. If the negotiations conclude successfully, a deal could be announced as early as this month, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.

2019-02-12,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose more than 1 percent on Tuesday after OPEC figures showed it cut production sharply in January, and as lead member Saudi Arabia said it would reduce its output in March by an additional 500,000 barrels.  Growing investor optimism for a breakthrough in the latest round of U.S.-China trade discussions also boosted futures as members of both sides met in Beijing.  Brent crude futures gained 91 cents, or 1.5 percent, to settle at $62.42 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures rose 69 cents, or 1.3 percent, to settle at $53.10 a barrel.  Oil prices edged up slightly post-settlement after data from the American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry group, showed U.S. crude oil stockpiles had unexpectedly fallen.  Crude inventories fell by 998,000 barrels in the week ended  Feb. 8 to 447.2 million, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 2.7 million barrels. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub fell by 502,000 barrels, API said. Production cuts effective to the end of June by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia have tightened markets despite rising output in non-member countries, primarily the United States. OPEC said on Tuesday it had reduced oil production almost 800,000 bpd in January to 30.81 million bpd under its voluntary global supply pact. Saudi Arabia Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told the Financial Times that the country would cut production to about 9.8 million bpd in March to bolster prices. As part of the OPEC deal, that nation pledged to cut output to about 10.3 million bpd.  “The market was bid on the OPEC report, the OPEC numbers themselves, and Saudi Arabia bringing the production numbers down pretty good,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho.  Investors were also hopeful that a new round of U.S.-China talks this week would bring the two sides close to resolving their ongoing trade war ahead of a March 1 deadline, Yawger said. U.S. President Donald Trump said he could push off the deadline to hike tariffs on Chinese imports if the two sides get close enough to striking a deal. The Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday it expected U.S. crude production to hit a new record of 13.2 million bpd through 2020, which took some steam out of the rally, traders said. OPEC also cut its forecast for 2019 world oil demand, citing slowing economies and expectations of faster supply growth from rivals, underlining the challenge it faces in preventing an oil glut.

The opposition leader and self-proclaimed president wants to secure control of the U.S. subsidiary of Venezuelan state-run PDVSA to finance his interim government. The U.S. and dozens of other nations have refused to recognize Nicolas Maduro as president, viewing his election last year to a second six-year term as fraudulent. Maduro in turn has denounced Guaido as a U.S. puppet who is seeking to foment a coup. The new board, which has been expected for weeks, will be assigned specific tasks by Guaido’s team to resolve internal disputes that have flared at the South American nation’s most important foreign asset, the people said. Two top American executives currently working for Citgo, Art Klein and Rick Esser, also would join the board, the people said.

2019-02-12,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that the U.S. Senate will vote on a “Green New Deal” introduced by Democrats that aims to slash U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to negligible levels in a decade. “I’ve noted with great interest the Green New Deal, and we’re going to be voting on that in the Senate, give everybody an opportunity to go on record and see how they feel about the Green New Deal,” McConnell said. The document introduced last week marked the first formal attempt by lawmakers to define legislation to create big government-led investments in clean energy, infrastructure and social programs. The goal is to transition the U.S. economy away from burning fossil fuels and emitting greenhouse gasses blamed for climate change, rising sea levels and severe storms. The initiative was unveiled by Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a rising political star, and Senator Edward Markey. The initiative has the backing of almost all the Democrats declared as candidates seeking for the party’s nomination in the 2020 presidential election. Co-sponsor Markey said McConnell’s call for a vote before hearings and a national debate on the Green New Deal was an attempt to sabotage the plan.  “They [Republicans] have offered no plan to address this economic and national security threat and want to sabotage any effort that makes Big Oil and corporate polluters pay,” he said in a statement. Republicans have used the Green New Deal to try to sow discord within the Democratic party, painting their political rivals as shifting to the left and embracing extreme policies. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had called the Green New Deal a “green dream” and some Democrats in fossil fuel-dependent or rural districts have stayed quiet on their position. Republican Senator John Barrasso, chair of the Senate environment committee, said Democrats were proposing a plan that “raises taxes, that overthrows really a productive energy market that we have right now in this country, raises energy costs, forces people out of work who are working in the energy field.” Barrasso represents the coal-producing state of Wyoming . The plan outlines some of the most aggressive climate goals ever put forward by Democratic lawmakers and clashes dramatically with the Trump administration’s efforts to advance domestic oil, gas and coal production by rolling back environmental protections.  Some Democrats hit back at the Republican attempt to call for a vote on the resolution before hearings and debates take place, calling it a “cynical” move.  “Instead of trying to cause mischief, the #Republican Party should put forward its own serious proposal to address #climatechange,” Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse wrote on Twitter on Tuesday.  President Donald Trump’s administration opposes action on climate change and favors boosting U.S. production of oil, gas and coal. On Monday, Trump poked fun at the Green New Deal at his campaign rally in El Paso, Texas, making exaggerated claims that the policy would force people to give up air travel and owning cows, a source of methane emissions. “I really don’t like their policy of taking away your car, of taking away your airplane rights, of ‘let’s hop a train to California,’ of you’re not allowed to own cows anymore!” Trump said at the rally.  The name, Green New Deal, references the New Deal of the 1930s that President Franklin Roosevelt implemented to aid Americans suffering in the Great Depression by embarking on huge government-led infrastructure projects.

2019-02-12,"SAO PAULO, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Biosev SA, the Brazilian sugar and ethanol maker controlled by commodities trader Louis Dreyfus, said its loss in the 2018/19 cane season through December rose 8.4 percent from the previous season to 892.6 million reais ($240.40 million). Biosev on Tuesday reported a loss of 230 million reais in the third quarter ended in December, mostly due to the depreciation of the Brazilian currency. The loss was 17 percent smaller than in the same period a year earlier. Almost 90 percent of Biosev’s 5.94 billion reais in debt is dollar denominated. The company said the currency fluctuations have a non-cash effect, since the majority of the debt matures between 2021 and 2023, when the company plans to have enough cash to pay. Juan José Blanchard, Biosev’s chief executive, told Reuters in a brief interview to comment on the results that the company’s performance in the quarter was positive, considering the challenging scenario of smaller cane crushing after a drought earlier in the year and low global sugar prices. “We managed to cut operational costs and production costs, looking to improve cash generation, even in this difficult situation” he said, citing a 2.5 percentage points improvement in EBITDA margin and 30 percent reduction in general expenses. Biosev sold two mills in Brazil’s Northeast region last year, in a move to optimize operations and cut expenses. Blanchard said there were no negotiations currently for further divestments and asset sales, denying a recent report in Brazilian media that Biosev was talking to Cargill for a possible partnership. The CEO said he expects an improvement in the sugar market in the second half of 2019, as the global sugar supply balance swings from a surplus to a deficit. $1 = 3.7130 reais

2019-02-12,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Acting U.S. defence chief Patrick Shanahan told Iraqi leaders that Washington understood its forces were in Iraq at Baghdad’s invitation, aiming to steady relations after President Donald Trump said U.S. troops were needed to keep an eye on Iran. Shanahan met Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi during an unannounced trip to Baghdad on Tuesday. “I made very clear that we recognise their sovereignty, their focus on independence and that we are there at the invitation of the government,” Shanahan told reporters. Trump infuriated Iraqi politicians this month by saying that a U.S. presence was needed in Iraq to observe Iran. Washington, which occupied Iraq from 2003-2011, now has around 5,200 troops in Iraq at the request of the Baghdad government to help fight against Islamic State. Iraq is an ally of both the United States and Iran, and its politics are often dominated by efforts to balance relations with two powerful countries that are bitter enemies. Trump’s suggestion that Iran was the target of the U.S. presence in Iraq was denounced across the political spectrum in Baghdad last week, including by Abdul Mahdi. President Barham Salih said the U.S. troops must stick to their anti-Islamic State mission; Iran-aligned politicians in Iraq’s parliament pressed demands that the U.S. mission be scaled back. The uproar came just months after Trump angered Iraqi leaders on his only visit to the country so far. On the day after Christmas Trump stopped only at a U.S. air base in the remote desert. Unlike predecessors Barack Obama and George W. Bush, he skipped the capital Baghdad and met no Iraqi officials.  Shanahan said the topic of U.S. troops in Iraq and Trump’s Iran comments did not come up during his talks with Abdul Mahdi, but the prime minister told him that Iraq needed to maintain strong relations with both Washington and Tehran.  “There is activity in their legislature... the discussions have been should they restrict the number of U.S. forces in Iraq and I wanted to make clear to (Abdul Mahdi) that we recognise our role, we understand that we are there by invitation,” Shanahan said.  Speaking after meeting with Shanahan, Abdul Mahdi said he respected the decisions of the parliament. “The government has its view and the political blocs have theirs,” he said.  U.S. officials have criss-crossed the Middle East in recent months to reassure allies that Washington remains committed to the region, after Trump announced in December that he would abruptly withdraw the 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria. That decision was opposed by top aides, including Defence Secretary Jim Mattis, who quit, leaving his deputy Shanahan in charge of the Pentagon. Shanahan met with U.S. military commanders while in Iraq to get an update on the fight against Islamic State. U.S.-backed fighters have mounted an attack against Islamic State’s last bastion in eastern Syria. U.S. officials have long estimated that the Syria pullout could take until sometime in March or April to execute fully, but have been reluctant to set an exact timeline given hard-to-predict battlefield conditions. Islamic State was declared defeated in Iraq in 2017, but continues to wage small-scale insurgent attacks in some areas.

2019-02-12,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Signs that the United States and China might reach an agreement in trade talks and news of a tentative deal to avoid another government shutdown in Washington helped push world stock markets and bond yields broadly higher Tuesday.  Tokyo’s Nikkei set the tone with a 2.6 percent rally, its best day of the year, while the Stoxx 600 index of European shares gained nearly 0.5 percent.  On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 372.65 points, or 1.49 percent, to 25,425.76, the S&P 500 gained 34.93 points, or 1.29 percent, to 2,744.73 and the Nasdaq Composite added 106.71 points, or 1.46 percent, to 7,414.62.  MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.17 percent. U.S. and Chinese officials expressed hopes that the new round of talks, which began in Beijing on Monday, would bring them closer to easing their nearly year-long trade war. Beijing and Washington are trying to hammer out a deal before a March 1 deadline, without which U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports are scheduled to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent. “There will be no winner in a trade war. So at some point they will likely strike a deal,” said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities in Tokyo. In Washington, U.S. lawmakers reached a tentative deal on border security funding, though aides cautioned that it did not contain the $5.7 billion President Donald Trump wants to build a wall on the Mexican border. “What investors are taking from this is that the government stays open; whether or not Trump signs on the deal is secondary,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. The dollar, meanwhile, slipped but remained near a two-month high after notching its longest winning streak - eight days straight - in two years. The dollar index fell 0.36 percent, with the euro up 0.49 percent to $1.133. The optimism that another government shutdown in the world’s largest economy would be averted and trade tensions between the United States and China were easing helped push bond yields higher as investors traded out of safety plays. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 6/32 in price to yield 2.6823 percent, up from 2.661 percent late on Monday. In commodity markets, oil prices jumped up as traders weighed support from OPEC-led supply restraint and a slowdown in the global economy. U.S. crude rose 2 percent to $53.49 per barrel and Brent gained 2. percent to $62.77.

2019-02-12,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A movie premiering in Berlin tells the true story of a young boy from a famine-stricken village in Malawi who studies books about energy then builds a wind turbine that enables farmers to irrigate their land. Directed by Chiwetel Ejiofor, “The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind” tells the story of William, an engineering enthusiast who  resorts to secretly using the school library to learn when he is expelled from school because his father - a poor farmer - cannot afford to pay the fees. The farm land around the village gets flooded, ruining the crops, and then later dries out, leaving people with hardly any food. Desperate villagers steal food from William’s family and they end up with just enough for one meal per day. Less educated villagers doubt William’s turbine idea will work and his father initially refuses to give him the bike - one of the family’s few possessions - that he needs to make it, telling him to start helping on the farm instead of studying. The father later gives in and William uses the bike, some wood and junk that he finds in a scrapyard to build the towering construction that powers a water pump. At the end of the movie, he climbs the turbine to see green plants shooting out of what was previously dry, cracked and barren land. “I was struck and continue to be struck by just what an extraordinary achievement it was,” Ejiofor said. “What his story represents is really living in the solution, not living in the problems.” The film is based on an autobiographical book with the same title written by the real-life William Kamkwamba. Kamkwamba said he hoped people who had not read the book would see the movie and learn about his story, adding: “They might get inspired by my work that I did, so I’m very excited.” Maxwell Simba, who plays William, said he was struck by William’s determination to fight for what he believes in despite his difficult relationship with his father and despite being expelled from school. “If you are really determined to go get what you want, then the universe has its own way of working out for you to achieve at the end of the day what you wanted to achieve,” he said.

2019-02-12,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Philadelphia Energy Solutions Inc, owner of the largest and oldest refinery on the U.S. East Coast, is facing another financial crisis just months after emerging from a controversial bankruptcy, according to two sources and a Reuters review of court filings.  PES, which exited bankruptcy in August, saw its cash balance fall to $87.7 million at the end of 2018, down from $148 million just three months earlier, a $61 million decline, according to a post-bankruptcy financial report filed late last month. The company entered bankruptcy roughly a year ago with $43 million cash on hand, court documents show. Refineries based on the East Coast suffer from difficult economics due to the cost of shipping crude oil from West Texas or Canada, but PES has had other problems at the plant in South Philadelphia including weak gasoline margins and high debt costs. The company filed for bankruptcy in January 2018, blaming its woes largely on the costs of complying with the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, a 2005 law that requires refiners to either blend biofuels like ethanol into fuel or purchase credits, called RINs, from competitors who do.  PES does not have those blending capabilities, so it has to pay for credits. But a Reuters analysis showed other factors played a role in the bankruptcy, including the withdrawal of more than $590 million in dividend-style payments from the company by its investor owners. After filing for bankruptcy, the company was given a waiver for half of its $350 million in liabilities related to biofuels credits by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Poor gasoline margins have hurt the company’s bottom line as well. PES’s weak cash position forced the refiner to significantly scale back a planned $90 million maintenance project that began in January, according to two sources familiar with the plant’s operations. Refiners perform maintenance to keep units operating reliably and safely, protecting themselves from costly unplanned outages. “I am not surprised that they are economically struggling once again, but I didn’t expect it to happen so soon,” Christina Simeone, a director at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, said. In the last three months of 2018, while PES saw its cash balance fall by $61 million, the compliance credits were trading at multi-year lows. ""They're having financial difficulties when RIN prices dropped 75 percent. It's pretty damming evidence against their bankruptcy claims that the RFS is the primary claim in filing bankruptcy,"" said Simeone, who authored a report bit.ly/2TGukjQ last year that predicted the refinery would close by 2022 due to poor economics. The site has been home to a refinery since 1870. PES spokeswoman Cherice Corley said the company declined to comment. U.S. East Coast refiners like PES lack access to cheaper crude that refiners in other parts of the country enjoy, which inflicts greater pain on the region’s industry when margins are low.  Delta Air Lines’ refinery in nearby Trainer, Pennsylvania, lost $40 million in the fourth quarter. The company is considering selling the plant, sources recently told Reuters. PES recently secured a $50 million loan from Bardin Hill Investment Partners, formerly Halcyon Capital Management, one of the plant’s owners, two sources told Reuters. The company still has more $700 million in long-term debt, most of which comes due in 2022. Private-equity giant Carlyle Group LP rescued the 330,000 barrel-per-day refinery from closure in 2012, betting they could tap cheap shale oil out of North Dakota and turn a hefty profit.  The bet proved lucrative in the early years, but once the discount on North Dakota’s oil eroded due to better transport options, PES’s bottom line started to suffer. Carlyle became a minority owner once the company emerged from bankruptcy. Deutsche Bank AG and Bardin Hill are the primary owners now. Bardin Hill did not respond to requests for comment; Deutsche Bank declined to comment.

2019-02-12,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union produced 17.5 percent of its power needs from renewable sources in 2017, while 11 of the bloc’s 28 members had already achieved a 2020 goal of 20 percent or more, the latest data released by Eurostat showed. Renewables, such as wind, solar and hydro power, accounted for 17 percent of the energy mix in the EU in 2016 and 8.5 percent in 2004, the first year for which figures were available, Eurostat said. The 2020 target is a stepping stone to the goal of 32 percent in 2030. “The EU is on track to meet its 2020 renewable target, with 11 member states already above their national targets,” said Climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete, who has called for the bloc to aim for net zero emissions. The report said Sweden had the highest share of renewable energy consumption, with more than half its energy coming from renewable sources in 2017. Luxembourg had the lowest proportion, with renewables accounting for just 6.4 percent of energy use.  The Netherlands, France, Ireland, Britain, Poland and Belgium were among EU nations still a few percentage points off their 2020 objective, as of 2017. European Environment Agency said last year the bloc’s shift towards renewable energy was slowing, putting its ability to meet its 2020 and 2030 targets at risk. The targets are part of the bloc’s overall drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 in line with the Paris Agreement to keep global warming well below 2 degrees.

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the city’s municipal utility, for years has been planning to modernize the Scattergood, Haynes and Harbor natural gas plants, in part because of a 2010 California law that power plants must stop using ocean water for cooling. The new, state-of-the art gas plants would have used air instead. But Los Angeles, which has already moved to eliminate coal from its energy mix, must also abandon natural gas if it wants to meet its goal of being carbon-neutral by 2050, Mayor Eric Garcetti said. The natural gas units will be phased out by 2029, the city said. “This is the beginning of the end of natural gas in Los Angeles,” Garcetti said in a statement. “The climate crisis demands that we move more quickly to end dependence on fossil fuel, and that’s what today is all about.” In 2017, LADWP sourced a third of its power from natural gas plants, according to the California Energy Commission. The three coastal plants make up nearly 40 percent of that total, the city said. In the same year, the city sourced another third of its electricity from renewables like solar and wind.

U.S. oil production this year is forecast to be at a record 12.41 million bpd, the EIA said.

By David Randall NEW YORK, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Signs that the United States and China might reach an agreement in trade talks and news of a tentative deal to avoid another government shutdown in Washington helped push world stock markets and bond yields broadly higher Tuesday. Tokyo’s Nikkei set the tone with a 2.6 percent rally, its best day of the year so far, while the Stoxx 600 index of European shares gained 0.5 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 316.23 points, or 1.26 percent, to 25,369.34, the S&P 500 gained 30.84 points, or 1.14 percent, to 2,740.64 and the Nasdaq Composite added 90.91 points, or 1.24 percent, to 7,398.81 in midday trading. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.05 percent. U.S. and Chinese officials expressed hopes that the new round of talks, which began in Beijing on Monday, would bring them closer to easing their nearly year-long trade war. Beijing and Washington are trying to hammer out a deal before a March 1 deadline, without which U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports are scheduled to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent. “There will be no winner in a trade war. So at some point they will likely strike a deal,” said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities in Tokyo. In Washington, U.S. lawmakers reached a tentative deal on border security funding, though aides cautioned that it did not contain the $5.7 billion President Donald Trump wants to build a wall on the Mexican border. “What investors are taking from this is that the government stays open, whether or not Trump signs on the deal is secondary,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. The dollar, meanwhile, slipped slightly but hovered near a two-month high after notching its longest winning streak - eight days straight - in two years. The dollar index fell 0.27 percent, with the euro up 0.38 percent to $1.1318. The optimism that another government shutdown in the world’s largest economy would be averted and trade tensions between the United States and China were easing helped push bond yields higher as investors traded out of safety plays. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.6859 percent, up from 2.661 percent late on Monday. In commodity markets, oil prices jumped up as traders weighed support from OPEC-led supply restraint and a slowdown in the global economy.

2019-02-12,"(Adds details, background) By Ahmed Ismail and Aidan Lewis CAIRO, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell, Eni, BP and Exxon Mobil were among the winners in one of Egypt’s largest ever oil and gas exploration tenders on Tuesday, as the country looks to sustain an investment upswing spurred by major discoveries. The awards marked Exxon Mobil’s entry into gas exploration in Egypt, while Shell was handed the most concessions, three for oil and two for gas, at an annual petroleum show that Egypt has used to promote itself as a hub for gas production and trading in the Eastern Mediterranean. Egypt expects investments of at least $750 million to $800 million in the first stage of exploration in the total of 12 concessions announced, Petroleum Minister Tarek El Molla said. The Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Corporation’s bid round, which was the largest in its history, included border areas in the Mediterranean Sea as well as land areas in the Nile Delta. Five gas exploration concessions were awarded - in which 20 wells will be drilled - to Shell, Exxon, Petronas, BP, DEA and Eni, the head of Egypt’s state gas board said. Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation’s (EGPC) tender meanwhile included areas in the Western Desert, the Nile Valley, the Gulf of Suez and the Eastern Desert. Neptune Energy, Merlon, Shell, Eni and state-controlled EGPC were awarded seven oil exploration concessions in total in which 39 wells will be drilled, Egypt’s petroleum ministry said. Eni’s discovery of the giant Zohr field in 2015, the largest in the Mediterranean and estimated to hold about 30 trillion cubic feet of gas, has raised interest in exploration in Egypt. The country has reached maritime demarcation agreements with several countries in the region in its push over recent years towards increased oil and gas exploration. Executives at the forum, which was attended by the CEOs of companies including BP and Shell, said Egypt’s advantages as a hub include well-developed infrastructure, established industry expertise, strong local demand, and the country’s strategic location between Europe and Asia, allowing it to send gas west or east depending on markets. They are also encouraged by Europe’s desire to diversify gas supplies and find alternative suppliers to Russia, and to reduce carbon emissions. Egypt hopes to tap long underutilised liquefaction plants, where gas is turned into LNG, to export supplies across the Mediterranean along with that of its neighbours, including Israel, which said it would pipe gas to Egypt later this year. “I think we’re starting to see much more robustness for this concept,” said Gasser Hanter, Shell’s country chairman, in reference to the concept of Egypt as an emerging hub. “You’re seeing the intergovernmental agreements being sorted out, you’re seeing the deregulation of the gas market, a lot of confidence in the economy, in Egypt, that is boosting the investment in the upstream.” However, executives also said longer-term challenges include geopolitical tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean, the need to further develop infrastructure, and competition from other suppliers including Russia and the United States.

2019-02-12,"BARCELONA, Feb 12 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Spain’s Balearic Islands set a course for a greener future on Tuesday, approving a climate change law that commits the tourism hotspot to source all its energy from renewables by 2050. The law includes a phase-out of coal power produced at Es Murterar plant on the popular holiday island of Mallorca by 2025, starting in 2020. Incentives and subsidies will be provided to boost clean energy generation on the four main islands - largely solar and some wind power - including at least 40 million euros ($45 million) for photovoltaic parks from the central government. The law also bans new diesel cars from circulating from 2025 and new petrol vehicles from 2035. Francina Armengol, Balearic Islands president, described the Climate Change and Energy Transition Act - whose adoption received a standing ovation in the local parliament - as “pioneering”, saying the region would set “a benchmark in the energy transition”. “We are convinced that protecting the environment also means protecting all those who live in the Balearic Islands, and we are determined to make the necessary changes to our infrastructure and economy,” she said in a statement. The law offers “an opportunity to reinforce our brand as a sustainable destination”, she added. Climate and energy plans will be established every five years with binding targets for companies and municipalities. Joan Groizard Payeras, director of renewable energy at IDAE, Spain’s national energy agency, said the political climate had moved on from the economic crisis that gripped Spain for much of the past decade, enabling constructive debate on green issues. “Over the past two to three years, the environment has come back onto the centre stage of politics,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Groizard, who was previously energy director for the Balearics government and an architect of the new law, said he hoped it would send a positive signal to the rest of Spain, and set an example for other regions to follow. Madrid has yet to pass a delayed national climate change law, drafted by the minority Socialist government which is struggling to get its 2019 budget through parliament. The prosperous northern region of Catalunya approved a climate law in 2017, which also aims to transition to 100-percent clean energy by 2050. The inhabitants of the Balearics, visited by 14 million people each year, have grasped the need for a green shift due to traffic jams and pollution in the summer, and extreme weather such as droughts and storms that have caused water shortages and washed away beaches, Groizard said. In October, heavy rains hit Mallorca, causing flash floods that killed at least 12 people. The law will require all new government projects - such as schools or water treatment facilities - to adapt to wild weather and rising seas, and to take into account how they contribute to curbing planet-warming emissions. Some measures in the law, when first proposed, sparked opposition amid concern about jobs at power plants running on fossil fuels. But on Friday, a deal was announced with Endesa, the company that operates Mallorca’s coal plant, and its workers’ union for a gradual shut-down that would avoid staff cuts, partly by transferring employees to gas plants in the short run. The closure of coal power capacity will cut emissions from Mallorca’s electricity system by a third. “It’s... absolutely right that they stop importing polluting coal and start harvesting their abundant sunshine, and the agreement to close the power station with no job losses is exemplary,” said Laurence Tubiana, president and CEO of the European Climate Foundation. Another sticking point has been fierce criticism from the auto industry of the move to shift to electric vehicles. But Groizard said the new regulations were in line with car manufacturers’ plans. And as the law only applies to new vehicles, residents will not be forced to switch to electric until they buy a new car. Meanwhile, a tender worth 12 million euros has been opened to install a network of a thousand charging points for electric vehicles on the islands. Car rental companies will have to incorporate electric vehicles into their fleets from 2020 onwards, while new public buses will run on natural gas or electricity. The adoption of electric vehicles will incentivise the production of more clean power, “providing for greater system efficiencies and lower transportation costs overall”, said Petar Georgiev of Eurelectric, a European association for the electricity industry. Marc Pons, the Balearic energy minister, said electric transport, renewables and energy efficiency would open up opportunities for growth, in line with a push to reduce reliance on tourism. Mallorca, for example, is marketing itself as a location for green tech firms. “The Climate Change Act draws a new economy for our islands, which need more diversification and less seasonality,” Pons said. $1 = 0.8852 euros

2019-02-12,"ROME (Reuters) - A Franco-Italian railway link would be a waste of public money and have a “strongly negative” financial impact, Italy’s transport ministry said on Tuesday in a report that will heighten tensions within the coalition. Work has already started on a 58-km (36-mile) tunnel that cuts through the Alps and is forecast to cost 8.6 billion euros  ($9.7 billion), with France and the European Union joining with Italy to foot the bill.  The whole rail link, which is backed by the ruling League party but fiercely opposed by its government partner the 5-Star Movement, has a price tag of more than 20 billion euros, Italy’s transport ministry says.  The 79-page cost-benefit analysis estimated that the cost of building the so-called TAV route and its projected economic return produced a negative balance of between 7.0-7.8 billion euros ($7.9-$8.8 billion). “As everyone can now see for themselves, the numbers of this economic and transport analysis are extremely negative,” said Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli, a 5-Star politician who commissioned the contested report. “It is now up to the government to make a decision.” The far-right League says the line connecting the French city of Lyon with Turin is vital to Italy’s export-driven economy. It made no immediate comment on Tuesday. 5-Star has repeatedly said it will never sanction the project while it remains in power. League leader Matteo Salvini has suggested a referendum to decide the matter. A separate analysis published by Italy’s transport ministry predicted that it could cost up to 1.3 billion euros (1.14 billion pounds) to halt work at this stage through possible contract penalties. France agreed last December to freeze new contracts on the tunnel boring operation until the Italian government, which took office last June, had completed the cost-benefit analysis. Relations between Paris and Rome have since deteriorated and President Emmanuel Macron last week recalled France’s ambassador to Rome following a war of words with both the League and 5-Star, which have accused Paris of undermining Italy’s economic, foreign and migrant policies. France and Italy are respectively each others’ second biggest trading partners and business leaders on both sides of the Alps say the TAV will facilitate commerce. Rome is also at loggerheads with the European Commission over its plans for an expansive, 2019 budget. However, Toninelli said these disputes had no bearing over the TAV analysis. “I want to stress that the negative evaluation of the Turin-Lyon link that emerges from this analysis is not against the EU or against France,” he said.

2019-02-12,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has decided to release a single draft rule to expand sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline and curb biofuel credit speculation, after having contemplated separating the measures, a senior official at the administration told Reuters on Tuesday. The EPA was thinking about releasing the measures separately to allow it to focus on finishing its rule to lift a summertime ban on sales of so-called E15 gasoline in time for the U.S. driving season, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday. Under the U.S. Renewable Fuels Standard, oil refiners have to blend increasing volumes of biofuels into the nation’s gasoline and diesel each year, or purchase credits - called Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) - from those who do. “When we came back from the shutdown....we had a conversation about whether we needed to split E15 RVP waiver from the RIN market reform,” Bill Wehrum, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, said in an interview. “Wheeler said the President had instructed us to keep it together and we are going to keep it together,” he said, referring to EPA’s Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler.  President Donald Trump announced in October he was directing the EPA to allow year-round sales of E15, in a win for the powerful corn industry which supplies ethanol.  E15 gasoline contains 15 percent ethanol, versus the 10 percent found in most U.S. gasoline. The ban had been imposed over concerns that E15 contributes to smog in hot weather. The agency has planned to release the draft rule in early February but ran into delay due to a 35 day-long partial government shutdown that furloughed workers. But Wehrum has said the agency is still set to complete the rule before June 1, in time for the summer driving season. The EPA will combine credit trading limits into the E15 rule as a concession to the oil industry, which says speculation increases the price of the biofuel credits it must purchase to comply with federal law. “We intend to keep them together for proposal and for final action,” Wehrum said, adding that the agency was moving at a ‘very expeditious’ pace on the E15 rule. He did not say when EPA would release the draft rule.

2019-02-12,"PARIS, Feb 12 (Reuters) - France’s military struck rebels in Chad to prevent a coup d’etat against President Idriss Deby, Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Tuesday. On Deby’s request, French warplanes bombed a heavily-armed rebel convoy that crossed last week from Libya deep into Chadian territory. “There was an attack by a rebel group that came from southern Libya ... to take power by force in N’djamena. President Deby asked us in writing to intervene to prevent a coup d’etat and protect his country,” Le Drian told lawmakers. The French jets destroyed dozens of pick-up trucks and the Chadian army subsequently said it had captured more than 250 rebels from the Union of Forces of Resistance (UFR), a Libya-based rebel coalition. Deby has faced several rebellions since seizing power in 1990 in a military coup. International observers have questioned the fairness of elections that have kept him in office, and last year Deby oversaw a reform of the constitution that would allow him to stay in power until 2033. France intervened in 2008 to stop the UFR toppling Deby. President Emmanuel Macron has said he wants a new relationship with France’s former colonies and that the era of propping up leaders in return for lucrative contracts for French companies — a policy known as La Francafrique — is over. France, however, considers Chad’s battle-hardened troops as vital in the fight against Islamist militants in West Africa and bases its 4,500-strong counter-terrorism Operation Barkhane force in the capital N’djamena “This (intervention) was totally in line with international law,” Le Drian said. The incursion, which Chadian troops tried to halt, underscores how Deby’s fight against Islamist militants in the region has stretched his military. The military effort has diverted finances away from public services and the economy, fuelling popular discontent in one of the world’s poorest nations.

2019-02-12,"* South African state power utility in crisis * Ramaphosa plans to split firm to boost efficiency * Power cuts due to unplanned outages, diesel shortage * Eskom hopes to end power cuts this week - official (Adds minister of public enterprises comments) By Alexander Winning JOHANNESBURG, Feb 12 (Reuters) - South African power utility Eskom implemented major electricity cuts for a third straight day on Tuesday, as a shortage of generating capacity exposed the frailty of the struggling state-owned firm despite government promises to revive it. President Cyril Ramaphosa is trying to reform Eskom, which supplies more than 90 percent of the power in Africa’s most industrialised economy but is drowning in more than $30 billion of debt, to lift the economy before an election in May. The cash-strapped utility said it would cut 3,000 megawatts (MW) of power from the national grid from 0600 GMT on Tuesday, likely until 2100 GMT, a day after cutting 4,000 MW in the worst power cuts seen in several years. Around a third of Eskom’s 45,000 MW capacity is offline. Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan told parliament on Tuesday that South Africa had asked Italian energy firm Enel for technical assistance to end the power cuts. “Enel will be sending two to three coal power station engineers to South Africa shortly,” Gordhan said. “These outages have a massive impact on the economy, from mining, big industries, manufacturing to small businesses like coffee shops,” he said. A senior generation official, Andrew Etzinger, told Reuters that around 11,000 MW was offline because of plant-related problems, while approximately 5,000 MW was out of service because of planned maintenance. A further 2,000 MW was unavailable because of a shortage of diesel. State-owned oil company PetroSA said it was in talks with Eskom over emergency diesel supplies. The power crisis prompted an urgent meeting of Eskom’s board of directors and executives with Gordhan on Monday, when it also pummelled the rand currency. On Tuesday the rand was little changed against the U.S. dollar. Etzinger said Eskom was aiming to end the power cuts by the end of the week by bringing some generating units back online. The cuts are prompting frustration among ordinary South Africans and shop workers, many of whom do not have access to backup power sources like diesel generators. “We’re struggling,” said Eunice Mashaba, a manager of a textile shop north of Johannesburg. “Yesterday the power went off at half past four so we had to close the shop early. Today we came in and there was no power. Most of my customers don’t carry cash, they have to swipe and the (card) machine doesn’t work.” Some firms in the mining sector, the backbone of the country’s economy, are looking at alternatives to reduce their dependence on Eskom. Miner Harmony Gold said on Tuesday that it was in talks to build a 30 MW solar plant to supply power to some of its assets, in an effort to cut its electricity costs and dependence on Eskom. “Our Eskom bill is massive. To replace Eskom would be a fallacy, we won’t be able to do that. However, where we have long-term projects we can start building solar plants,” Harmony Chief Executive Peter Steenkamp said at a presentation of the company’s results. Ramaphosa, who announced a plan last week to split Eskom into three separate entities in an effort to make it more efficient, has said the latest power cuts are “most worrying”. The president’s plan to split Eskom faces opposition from powerful labour unions and from within his ruling African National Congress party, while some analysts have said a bolder approach is needed to address the financial rot at the utility. Etzinger said Eskom was for now treating unplanned outages at some of its power stations as technical breakdowns, despite speculation from analysts that disgruntled union members could have sabotaged some units. “There’s no reason to believe it’s sabotage,” he said.

2019-02-12,"(Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc said on Tuesday it plans to cut the amount of methane escaping from its natural gas wells, pipelines and other infrastructure by 50 percent over the next decade as part of its effort to combat global warming. The company, one of the biggest U.S. power and gas utilities, held contests among its business units to determine how much methane emissions they could reduce, said Diane Leopold, president and CEO of Dominion’s Gas Infrastructure Group. “Rather than focus on saving money, which drove some of our early methane emission programs, we started thinking about sustainability and methane reductions,” Leopold said. Methane, the primary component of natural gas, has more than 80 times the heat-trapping potential of carbon dioxide in the first 20 years after it escapes into the atmosphere, scientists say. The energy industry is the largest source of U.S. methane emissions, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). However, there is a market for methane. The more methane kept in pipes, the more gas companies can sell to customers.  Dominion said the goal is to prevent more than 430,000 metric tons of methane, or 23 billion cubic feet (bcf) of natural gas, from entering the atmosphere between 2010 and 2030. The company said that would be equivalent to taking 2.3 million cars off the road for a year. Dominion has 3.4 million gas distribution customers in West Virginia, Ohio, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho and the Carolinas, over 100,000 miles of gas pipelines and 1 trillion cubic feet of underground storage and production. Leopold said the company will cut methane emissions across all its gas businesses by reducing venting during planned maintenance and inspections, replacing older equipment and expanding leak detection and repair programs, among other things. The amount of methane that leaked from U.S. gas systems was about 1.4 percent to 2.3 percent of the country’s total output, according to studies by the EPA and the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group. Leopold said the company did not want to estimate the cost of its programs since the goal was to reduce methane emissions. “We wanted to find out how much methane we could save, not the dollars we could save,” Leopold said. She said Dominion held competitions to design programs to reduce methane emissions. In one, the company asked its businesses to figure out how much emissions they could reduce with $1 million. Dominion said this initiative builds on previous efforts to cut methane on the gas side of its business and carbon emissions on the power side. The company is also working with customers to help them cut their methane emissions. Dominion has partnered with Smithfield Foods to invest at least $250 million in North Carolina, Virginia and Utah to capture waste methane from hog farms that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere and convert it into renewable natural gas to heat homes and power local industries. The Trump administration, meanwhile, is rolling back Obama-era rules aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, saying lighter regulations will boost economic growth. Opponents say this will worsen global warming. “With or without regulations, we’re going to proceed with our programs,” Leopold said.

2019-02-12,"NEW YORK, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Signs that the U.S. and China might reach an agreement in trade talks and news of a tentative deal to avoid another government shutdown in Washington helped push world stock markets and bond yields broadly higher Tuesday. Tokyo’s Nikkei set the tone with a 2.6 percent rally, its best day of the year so far, while the Stoxx 600 index of European shares gained 0.5 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 238.95 points, or 0.95 percent, to 25,292.06, the S&P 500 gained 24.75 points, or 0.91 percent, to 2,734.55 and the Nasdaq Composite added 81.40 points, or 1.11 percent, to 7,389.30 in early trading. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.89 percent. U.S. and Chinese officials expressed hopes that the new round of talks, which began in Beijing on Monday, would bring them closer to easing their nearly year-long trade war. Beijing and Washington are trying to hammer out a deal before a March 1 deadline, without which U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports are scheduled to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent. “There will be no winner in a trade war. So at some point they will likely strike a deal,” said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities in Tokyo. In Washington, U.S. lawmakers reached a tentative deal on border security funding, though aides cautioned that it did not contain the $5.7 billion President Donald Trump wants to build a wall on the Mexican border. “What investors are taking from this is that the government stays open, whether or not Trump signs on the deal is secondary,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. The dollar, meanwhile, hovered near a two-month high after notching its longest winning streak - eight days straight - in two years. The dollar index fell 0.15 percent, with the euro up 0.16 percent to $1.1293. The optimism that another government shutdown in the world’s largest economy would be averted and trade tensions between the U.S. and China were easing helped push bond yields higher as investors traded out of safety plays. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 6/32 in price to yield 2.6823 percent, from 2.661 percent late on Monday. In commodity markets, oil prices jumped up as traders weighed support from OPEC-led supply restraint and a slowdown in the global economy.

2019-02-12,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC said on Tuesday it had cut oil production steeply under a global supply deal, although it flagged headwinds confronting its efforts to prevent a glut this year including weaker demand and higher rival output. In a monthly report, OPEC said its oil output fell almost 800,000 barrels per day in January to 30.81 million bpd. That is still slightly more than the demand OPEC expects for its crude on average in 2019. Worried by a drop in oil prices and rising supplies, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia agreed in December to make supply cuts. Under the deal, OPEC is lowering output by 800,000 bpd from Jan. 1. In the report, OPEC cut its forecast for 2019 world economic growth by 0.2 percentage point to 3.3 percent and highlighted a range of headwinds such as a slowdown in global trade. “Some recent positive developments could support the global economy at its current level, including the recovery in oil prices, possible progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations and less-ambitious monetary tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve,” OPEC said in the report. “Nevertheless, this would not lift the global economy beyond the growth forecast.” Oil extended a rally on Tuesday above $63 a barrel. Crude has risen from less than $50 in December, supported by the Saudi Arabia-led OPEC cuts and involuntary declines despite concerns about slowing demand. The supply cut was a policy U-turn after the producer alliance known as OPEC+ agreed in June 2018 to boost supply amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to lower prices and cover an expected shortfall in Iranian exports. OPEC changed course after prices slid from $86 a barrel in October, making the producers wary of a new glut. An OPEC+ cut from January 2017 had got rid of an earlier surplus. In a sign of excess supply, OPEC’s report said oil inventories in developed economies were above the five-year average in December. The biggest drop in OPEC supply last month came from Saudi Arabia and amounted to 350,000 bpd, the report showed. With the supply cut delivered in January, the 11 OPEC members expected to cut supply under the deal achieved 86 percent compliance, according to a Reuters calculation - a high rate by OPEC’s past standards.   This could rise in coming months as Saudi Arabia voluntarily lowers supply by more than it agreed. Saudi Arabia plans to pump around 9.8 million bpd in March, more than 500,000 bpd below its target under the deal, its energy minister told the Financial Times.  And further declines in Iran, Libya and Venezuela - exempt from the supply pact - could give a tailwind. OPEC said in the report that 2019 demand for its crude would decline to 30.59 million bpd, a drop of 240,000 bpd from its last report, as rivals such as the United States boost output and the slowing economy limits demand. This implies that the global market would see a slight surplus of about 200,000 bpd in 2019 should OPEC keep pumping at January’s rate although - other things being equal - the Saudi plan to reduce supply further will offset this. OPEC forecast global oil demand would grow by 1.24 million bpd in 2019, down 50,000 bpd from last month. Non-OPEC producers will boost output by 2.18 million bpd, 80,000 more than expected previously.

2019-02-12,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Venezuela hopes to create a trade bloc consisting of China, India and Russia to help the South American country settle oil payments in currencies other than the dollar, its oil minister said on Tuesday. The strife-torn country is looking for alternative payment methods to keep oil flowing to India, a crucial export market, especially after the United States imposed sanctions curbing the OPEC member’s crude exports to the United States. “We all can build one economy and that economy does not necessarily have to be within the dollar economy,” Manuel Quevedo said, referring to China, Russia and India.   Quevedo, who on Monday said Caracas was open to barter trade with New Delhi, declined to disclose details on how he planned to do business with India. “We are certainly not going to inform (regarding how we plan to do business) those who want to destroy our oil industry,” he said on the sidelines of India’s biennial Petrotech Conference. Venezuela is supplying oil to all of its clients including Reliance Industries despite sanctions, Quevedo said.

2019-02-12,"NEW DELHI/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is expected to announce investments in energy and infrastructure during a  visit to India and Pakistan in coming days as part of his efforts to wean the Saudi economy off oil exports. He is also expected to visit China, Malaysia and Indonesia during a tour that will be his first through the region since the storm over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. Prince Mohammed is expected to sign agreements, mostly linked to a refinery and the power sector, during the trip to Pakistan this weekend, Pakistani officials said. The memorandums of understanding will include renewable energy projects and investments in petrochemicals and mineral resources, Saudi state news agency SPA said. The prince is expected in New Delhi next week, along with leading Saudi businessmen, at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday.     Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan was among a handful of leaders who attended an investment conference in Saudi Arabia in October, an event boycotted by many companies and world leaders in protest over Khashoggi’s killing. India’s Modi met the prince in November, when they were both in Argentina for a Group of 20 summit. Saudi Arabia is India’s top supplier of crude oil but the two countries have expanded ties beyond energy, and their governments have agreed to build a strategic partnership, the foreign ministry said. In a statement, it cited cooperation in areas including  energy security, trade and investment, infrastructure, defence and security. India is expecting Prince Mohammed to announce an initial investment in its National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), a quasi-sovereign wealth fund, to help accelerate the building of ports and highways, an Indian official said. Saudi state media said Saudi officials will discuss an investment in NIIF.  Saudi Arabia has also flagged a desire to invest in India’s farm sector, with products to be exported to Saudi, another official at the trade ministry said. However, progress on a $44 billion refinery that Indian state-run oil companies agreed to build with Saudi Aramco on India’s west coast has been held up by strong opposition from mango farmers who will lose their land. Since taking office in 2014, Modi has sought to use India’s fast-growing economy to attract more investment from Saudi Arabia and other Islamic nations. As a fellow Muslim country, Pakistan has long maintained strong ties with Saudi Arabia. In late October, Riyadh offered Pakistan a $6 billion loan to help keep its ailing economy afloat.    Saudi Arabia has also announced plans for a $10 billion refinery and petrochemical complex at the coastal city of Gwadar, where China is building a port as part of its vast Belt and Road initiative.      “They’re looking at the energy sector, at some of our privatisation plans that they might bid for through our privatisation process,” Pakistani investment minister Haroon Sharif told Reuters.      Sharif, who chairs Pakistan’s Board of Investment, said there was also Saudi interest in Pakistan’s mining sector.     “Saudi Arabia has huge resources. Their investment fund is over $1 trillion, so we want just a fraction of that,” said a second Pakistani minister, who did not wish to be named. Saudi state news said Saudi officials will discuss investments with China, South Korea and Indonesia, in sectors including healthcare and telecommunications, without giving further details.

Tokyo’s Nikkei set the tone with its best day of the year so far and, as Europe’s traders hauled the STOXX 600 back towards two-month highs set last week, it was little surprise to see Wall Street futures pointing higher. Germany’s DAX jumped as much as 1.3 percent and Paris and Milan were both up 1 percent, though London’s FTSE lagged amid UK PLC’s ongoing Brexit uncertainty. The other big focus was the dollar, which hovered at a two-month high having just scored its longest winning streak - eight days straight - in two years. “We have had two bits of relatively good news overnight - optimism about the U.S. shutdown not resuming and optimism about a trade deal,” said Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes. “Equities are higher, bond yields are a little bit higher, yen and Swiss franc weakest of the major currencies, so it’s sort of risk-on rules OK!” Another risk-sensitive currency the Australian dollar also gained and as well as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc, U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds, which are also traditional safety-plays, also sold off. Juckes said he reckoned there was now a 75 percent chance that a ratcheting up of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will now be avoided and a 95 percent chance that another U.S. government shutdown will be averted. Those odds got a boost after U.S. lawmakers reached a tentative deal on border security funding, though aides did caution that it did not contain the $5.7 billion President Donald Trump wants to build a wall on the Mexican border. U.S. and Chinese officials had also expressed hopes that the new round of talks, which began in Beijing on Monday, would bring them closer to easing their near year-long trade war. Beijing and Washington are trying to hammer out a deal before a March 1 deadline, without which U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports are scheduled to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent. “There will be no winner in a trade war. So at some point they will likely strike a deal,” said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities in Tokyo. Underscoring the dramatic turn this year, Bank of America said emerging markets - which in 2018 suffered one of their worst years on record - were now the most “crowded trade” among its clients with $625 billion of asset-buying firepower. S&P 500 e-mini futures, meanwhile, were up after a mixed Monday, with trade-sensitive industrial bellwethers, Boeing and Caterpillar and some major chipmakers all up in pre-market moves. Most of Asia had nudged higher overnight but it was Japan’s Nikkei that caught the eye as its scored its best day of the year so far with a 2.6 percent surge, having started the day at a one-month low. With the yen backtracking, shares of exporters such as automakers and machinery makers had led the charge. Separately, Deutsche Bank noted it was also 20 years since Japan cut interest rates to zero, something now standard in large parts of Europe. The yen’s weakness came as the dollar consolidated its longest unbroken rally in two years against a basket of six major currencies. The dollar popped up to a six-week high of 110.65 yen . In contrast, the euro dropped to as low as $1.1267, its weakest in 2-1/2 months, and last traded at $1.12790. Even Klaas Knot, one of the ECB’s arch hawks, was suddenly sounding cautious about the central bank ending almost a decade of heavy euro zone stimulus. “At this moment a wait-and-see attitude is probably the optimal attitude,” Knot said in an interview with the Financial Times. Although the Federal Reserve’s dovish turn dented the dollar earlier this month, analysts also note the U.S. currency still has the highest yield among major FX peers and that the Fed continues to shrink its balance sheet. “It has been particular strong as of late again because of the decoupling between the U.S. and the rest of world if you look at (economic) surprise indicators,” Andrey Kuznetsov, a bond portfolio manager at Hermes Investment Management, said. In commodity markets, oil prices also jumped up as traders weighed support from OPEC-led supply restraint and a slowdown in the global economy. U.S. crude futures traded at $53.64 per barrel, up $1.42. Brent crude rose $1.20 percent to $62.89 per barrel. Gold was a touch stronger too at $1,314 an ounce.

2019-02-12,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s state-owned oil company are tightening the global oil market and sending refiners around the world scrambling to find replacements for the country’s diesel-rich heavy and extra heavy crudes. Venezuela’s heavy crudes, such as Merey, have few close substitutes, with the nearest being grades such as Brazil’s Marlim, Mexico’s Maya, Canada’s Bow River and Cold Lake, or Iraq’s Basra Heavy. Most of those crudes have an even higher sulphur content than Venezuela’s, which will require extra processing to make fuels of acceptable quality, and in any event the quantities are limited in the short term. Venezuela sanctions have arrived in a market that was already likely to be short of medium and heavy crudes because of U.S. sanctions on Iran and OPEC’s output cuts. The major oil exporters in the Middle East Gulf (Saudi Arabia, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iran) market mostly medium and heavy crudes. U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, together with OPEC’s output cuts, have therefore removed mostly medium and heavy oils from the market, leaving lighter grades relatively unaffected. The result is that prices of medium and heavy crudes have surged relative to their lighter counterparts since the middle of January. Mars, a medium crude grade from the U.S. Gulf, has moved to a rare premium over Louisiana Light Sweet. Oman, another medium crude, has moved to a premium over Brent, a light one. Venezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves, amounting to around 300 billion barrels, ahead of Saudi Arabia on 265 billion and Canada at 170 billion (“Statistical review of world energy”, BP, 2018). But the country’s oil industry has been in relative and absolute decline for the last 50 years as problems of producing and marketing its heavy crudes have been compounded by an unattractive investment regime and mismanagement. Venezuela’s crude production slumped from 3.8 million barrels per day in 1970 to just 1.7 million bpd in 1985, recovering to 3.4 million bpd in 1998 before slumping again to 2.1 million bpd in 2017. Venezuela accounted for 16 percent of OPEC output and 8 percent of world production in 1970 but those percentages had fallen to just 5 percent and 2 percent respectively by 2017. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2E4Pfb9). The country’s very dense crudes, some of which barely float on water, are complicated to process and sell for a large discount compared to other producers. Production has been hampered by corruption, political interference and lack of foreign investment and technology to maintain existing fields and develop new ones. Like Iran, another founding member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Venezuela’s oil industry has been blighted by mismanagement, unrest, political instability, diplomatic isolation and sanctions. Output has gone into free fall as the country’s isolation has increased, shrinking from 2.4 million bpd in 2016 to 2.0 million bpd in 2017 and 1.5 million bpd in 2018, according to the Joint Organisations Data Initiative. Venezuela was once a major oil exporter to the United States, but shipments have fallen from 1.4 million bpd in 1998 to around 500,000 bpd in 2018 (“Petroleum supply monthly”, EIA, Jan 2019). Venezuela’s diminished importance in the global oil market and as a supplier to the United States has emboldened the U.S. administration to take a tough approach in attempting to oust the government of Nicolas Maduro. Sanctions announced last month prohibit U.S. corporations and persons from financial transactions with state-owned oil company PDVSA. The U.S. Treasury’s guidance, which appears deliberately unclear, has left many third-country buyers uncertain about whether they can do business with PDVSA without also falling foul of sanctions. The U.S. administration likely calculated any fallout from sanctions on oil prices would be small given the limited volumes of crude involved and the expectation that the standoff would be resolved quickly. But while Venezuela’s crude now accounts for a very limited share of the global oil market, it plays a much more important role in the niche market for heavy crude. Venezuela accounted for 1 million bpd of heavy-sour crude production out of a worldwide total of 7 million bpd in 2017 (“World Oil Review”, ENI, 2018). Heavy crudes are much harder to refine and tend to contain significant quantities of sulphur and other impurities that are costly to remove, which is why they sell at a hefty discount to medium and light oils. For refineries that have invested in delayed coking units, however, heavy crudes can yield large volumes of middle distillates (gasoil, diesel and jet fuel). Middle distillates are used mostly in freight transportation as well as manufacturing, mining and farming, and are particularly valuable late in the business cycle when economic activity is near to the peak. Mid-distillates are especially prized at the moment with the forthcoming introduction of new bunker fuel regulations by the International Maritime Organization from the start of 2020. In effect, sanctions have shifted the balance of global oil production in the direction of lighter crudes, at the same time that the economy and forthcoming regulations are pushing refinery demand towards heavier grades. The sudden embargo on Venezuela’s exports has therefore sent refiners in the United States and elsewhere scrambling to find alternative supplies compatible with their equipment. If refiners are unable to source enough heavy and extra heavy crude, they will buy the next best alternative, in this case medium density crudes, so the impact of sanctions is rippling through the entire oil market.

2019-02-12,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Air pollution in 39 major northern Chinese cities rose 16 percent on the year in January, official data showed, with surging industrial activity making it increasingly unlikely they will meet their winter emissions targets. Average concentrations of small, hazardous particles known as PM2.5 in two major northern Chinese emissions control zones climbed 16 percent from a year earlier to 114 micrograms per cubic meter, according to Reuters analysis of official pollution data. China has vowed not to ease up when it comes to fighting pollution even amid an economic slump, but rising emissions of lung-damaging smog last month suggests that some provinces could struggle to balance that goal with an upturn in industrial production. “The reasons for the increases in PM2.5 levels are not hard to identify,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, energy analyst with environmental group Greenpeace, who noted that steel, thermal power and cement production surged throughout the region in the final quarter of 2018. “The outsourcing of industrial output that took place last winter in order for Beijing to hit its air quality targets was reversed this winter, driving air pollution levels up in the region while the rest of the country has seen improvements.”         The worst performer over the month was the coal city of Linfen in Shanxi province, which saw average PM2.5 levels of 174 micrograms, up 23 percent from a year earlier. Shijiazhuang, the provincial capital of Hebei, China’s biggest steelmaking region, also saw emissions rise 30 percent to 144 micrograms. China’s official air quality standard is 35 micrograms, while the World Health Organization recommends an annual average of no more than 10.  Over the three months beginning in November 2018, when coal-fired heating systems are switched on throughout the north, average PM2.5 in the 39 cities reached 93.5 micrograms, up 12 percent on the year.  Anyang, a coal and steel producing city in Henan province, was the worst performer over that period, with average concentrations at 124 micrograms, up 27 percent. Henan has blamed its poor performance this winter on “unfavorable weather conditions”. China’s environment ministry did not respond to a request for comment. However, senior official Liu Bingjiang told reporters last month that local governments would be held fully accountable for any failures, regardless of the weather. Most of the cities are aiming to cut pollution by 3 percent compared to 12 months earlier, far lower than last year’s target of around 15 percent. The compliance period also began a month earlier in October, when pollution is normally much lower. However, they are still struggling to meet targets.   “With four months of the October-March period passed and two to go, it would take a very steep 20-percent reduction in February-March to get to the 3-percent reduction target,” said Myllyvirta.

2019-02-12,"* Harmony Gold H1 profit slumps 94 pct * Firm in talks to build solar power plant (Recasts with solar power plans) By Tanisha Heiberg JOHANNESBURG, Feb 12 (Reuters) - South African miner Harmony Gold is in talks to build a 30 megawatt solar power plant in the Free State province to supply power to some of its operations to try to reduce power costs and dependence on struggling utility Eskom. Eskom, which produces over 90 percent of South Africa’s electricity, is saddled with more than $30 billion in debt and has had to impose some of the country’s worst power cuts in years over the past few days. Eskom’s troubles are a big headache for heavy energy users in South Africa, particularly gold mining companies. “Our Eskom bill is massive. To replace Eskom would be a fallacy, we won’t be able to do that. We can however, where we have long term projects, we can start building solar plants,” Harmony CEO Peter Steenkamp said. Harmony said it was in talks with the state energy regulator over a licence to build a solar power plant in Welkom in the Free State province. “We have gone through the procurement process and we have now managed to bed down a developer and an investor in a 30 megawatt facility in Welkom which will relieve some of our dependence on Eskom,” Melanie Naidoo-Vermaak, executive for sustainable development at Harmony, said. The company, which uses around 280 megawatts of power at its South African operations, plans to use the solar plant to help to supply its longer life assets including its Tshepong operations in the Free State. Harmony said it had also taken action to reduce consumption during peak periods and improved efficiency of pumping operations. Eskom said last week it was requesting steeper electricity tariff increases from the energy regulator of 17.1 percent in 2019/20, 15.4 percent in 2020/21 and 15.5 percent in 2021/22. The utility also implemented a third day of planned power cuts on Tuesday because of a shortage of generating capacity. “That will change cut-offs, that will change life of mines that will have an impact on jobs if Eskom continues with the very high increases,” Harmony CEO Steenkamp said. Harmony also reported a 94 percent drop in first-half profit on Tuesday on the back of higher costs and depreciation, and a weaker rand, even though gold production rose 34 percent to 751,008 ounces. By 1215 GMT shares in Harmony were up 3.45 percent to 30.28 rand on the back of a robust operational performance. “They had a number of acquisitions which they had done in the previous financial year that had one off items which impacted their profitability but from an operational point of view the business has done considerably well,” Paul Chakaduka, a trader at investment firm Global Trader. Harmony, which has 16 percent of its costs coming from electricity, said it’s South African operations were also impacted by two months of higher winter electricity tariffs and annual wage increases. $1 = 13.7990 rand

2019-02-12,"(Adds graphics, updates Brent price) LONDON, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia plans to produce around 9.8 million barrels per day of oil in March, over half a million bpd below its pledged production level under a global supply-cutting deal, Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told the Financial Times. Exports would fall in March to 6.9 million bpd, according to the article published on Tuesday. The March production figure means Saudi would be voluntarily cutting output by more than 500,000 bpd below its pledged production level under a deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia. Under the deal reached in December and which came into effect at the start of the year, Saudi Arabia’s target production is 10.311 million bpd. The news boosted Brent crude prices by more than 2 percent to nearly $63 a barrel. Production in March would be 1.2 million bpd lower than Saudi Arabia’s November output, which was an all-time high. In the interview, Falih addressed a U.S. bill that might expose OPEC to antitrust lawsuits, saying the legislation could be “harmful” to the global economy, and expressed his hope that the United States would “do the right thing”. He said if Saudi Arabia were unable to balance the market by adjusting production, the world would suffer “irreparably”.

OPEC, Russia and other non-OPEC producers, an alliance known as OPEC+, agreed in December to reduce supply by 1.2 million bpd from Jan. 1 to prevent excess supply building up. OPEC’s share of that cut is 800,000 bpd. In the report, OPEC said its oil output fell by 797,000 bpd month on month to 30.806 million bpd in January.

2019-02-12,"(Refiles to fix slug keyword used by media subscribers) By Sanjeev Miglani and Drazen Jorgic NEW DELHI/ISLAMABAD Feb 12 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is expected to announce investments in energy and infrastructure during a  visit to India and Pakistan in coming days. The prince, known as MBS, is also expected to visit China, Malaysia and Indonesia during a tour that will be his first through the region since the storm over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last October. Prince Mohammed is due in visit Pakistan this weekend, when he is expected to ink agreements, mainly linked to a refinery and the power sector, Pakistani officials said. He is expected in New Delhi next week, along with leading Saudi businessmen, at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday. Pakistan’s new Prime Minister Imran Khan was among a handful of heads of state who attended Riyadh’s flagship investment conference that month, an event that was boycotted by many companies and world leaders in protest over Khashoggi’s murder. India’s Modi met the prince in November, when they were both in Argentina for a Group of 20 summit. Though Saudi Arabia remains India’s top crude oil supplier, the two countries have expanded ties beyond energy, and their governments have agreed to build a strategic partnership, the foreign ministry said. “In recent years, there has been significant progress in bilateral cooperation in key areas of mutual interest, including energy security, trade and investment, infrastructure, defence and security,” the ministry said in a statement. India is expecting Prince Mohammed to announce an initial investment in its National Investment and Infrastructure Fund, a quasi-sovereign wealth fund, to help accelerate the building of ports and highways, an Indian official said. Saudi Arabia has also flagged a desire to invest in India’s farm sector, with products to be exported to Saudi, another official at the trade ministry said. However, progress on a $44 billion refinery that Indian state-run oil companies agreed to build with Saudi Aramco on India’s west coast has been held up by strong opposition from mango farmers who will lose their land. Since taking office in 2014, Modi has sought to use India’s fast-growing economy to attract more investment from Saudi Arabia and other Islamic nations. As a fellow Muslim country, Pakistan has long maintained strong ties with Saudi Arabia. In late October, Riyadh offered Pakistan a $6 billion loan to help keep its ailing economy afloat. Saudi Arabia has also announced plans for a $10 billion refinery and petrochemical complex at the coastal city of Gwadar, where China is building a port as part of its vast Belt and Road initiative. “They’re looking at the energy sector, at some of our privatization plans that they might bid for through our privatization process,” Pakistani investment minister Haroon Sharif told Reuters. Sharif, who chairs Pakistan’s Board of Investment, said there was also Saudi interest in Pakistan’s mining sector. “Saudi Arabia has huge resources. Their investment fund is over $1 trillion, so we want just a fraction of that,” said a second Pakistani minister, who did not wish to be named.

2019-02-12,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Labor unions say they are withholding support for a Green New Deal unveiled by Democrats last week to transition the American economy away from fossil fuels, arguing the loosely-defined plan could kill jobs if its architects aren’t careful.     The cool response from unions underscores the challenge facing Democratic presidential hopefuls who support aggressive action on climate change but must also win back the blue-collar voters that swept President Donald Trump to victory in 2016. The Green New Deal is a non-binding Congressional resolution introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Edward Markey that would legislate government-led investment in clean energy infrastructure with the goal of making America carbon neutral within a decade. Democratic presidential hopeful Senators Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren have already thrown their support behind it.  The resolution’s backers say the plan - once fully sketched out in the legislation - would create jobs in much the same way as President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal of the 1930s by putting Americans to work on transformative government-led projects.  It also calls for a “just transition” for current fossil fuel workers - from coal miners to pipeline workers - through guarantees of healthcare, jobs, and job training.  Union officials told Reuters they were skeptical. “We will never settle for ‘just transition’ language as a solution to the job losses that will surely come from some of the policies in the resolution,” said Yvette Pena O’Sullivan, executive director of the Laborers’ International Union of North America (LIUNA), whose members work in construction and other industries.         Phil Smith, a spokesman for the United Mine Workers (UMWA), which represents workers in the coal industry, echoed the concerns.     “We’ve heard words like ‘just transition’ before, but what does that really mean? Our members are worried about putting food on the table,” he said. LIUNA and UMWA said they were not contacted for input on the resolution before it was released.     Sean McGarvey, president of the North America’s Building Trades Unions, representing construction workers across all sectors including energy, said his staff had been contacted by Markey’s office about the Green New Deal, but said his members are skeptical of “green job” promises.      Members “working in the oil and gas sector can make a middle-class living, whereas renewable energy firms have been less generous,” he said at a pipeline safety event last week. Democrats backing the resolution are seeking to highlight the contrast in their position with the Trump administration’s vocal support for drilling and mining and its skepticism about the causes and impacts of global warming. Trump’s approach was warmly received in 2016 in parts of Appalachia and the Rust Belt, which have been suffering from manufacturing and mining jobs losses. Trump’s Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton struggled to sell her clean energy agenda in those regions, and suffered politically after saying her policies would “put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” The Sunrise Movement, a youth organization backing the Green New Deal, plans to launch a multi-state campaign in March to drum up support, featuring stops in Michigan, Kentucky and Pennsylvania.     “A lot of places struggling with joblessness are fossil fuel dependent places that suffer from poor air and water quality. Guaranteeing the right of clean air, water and jobs is something we think a lot of people can get behind,” said Stephen O’Hanlon, a spokesman for the group. Unions have expressed support in the past for more moderate approaches to addressing climate change, including cap-and-trade systems to curb carbon dioxide emissions.

2019-02-12,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is considering releasing its draft proposal to expand sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline without including simultaneous measures it promised the oil industry to curb biofuel credit speculation, according to three sources familiar with the matter. The move would help the agency lift a summertime ban on sales of so-called E15 gasoline in time for the U.S. driving season, but is likely to anger oil refiners that had been asking the Trump administration for biofuel credit market reforms to reduce their costs. If EPA passed on introducing biofuel credit trading limits, it would leave the door open to potential speculative price surges that could cost refiners like Valero Energy Corp hundreds of millions of dollars. President Donald Trump announced in October he was directing the EPA to allow year-round sales of E15, in a win for the powerful corn industry which supplies ethanol. E15 gasoline contains 15 percent ethanol, versus the 10 percent found in most U.S. gasoline. The ban had been imposed over concerns that E15 contributes to smog in hot weather. “President Trump charged EPA with issuing a new rule on E15 RVP and RIN market reform and doing that in a timely manner remains our goal,” EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said in email comment. The EPA had initially planned to combine credit trading limits into the E15 rule as a concession to the oil industry, which says speculation increases the price of biofuel credits it must purchase to comply with federal law.  Under the U.S. Renewable Fuels Standard oil refiners have to blend increasing volumes of biofuels into the nation’s gasoline and diesel each year, or purchase credits - called Renewable Identification Numbers - from those who do.     The combined draft proposal was scheduled for release this month, and was meant to be finalized and implemented by June. “The EPA has been seriously looking at dropping the RIN reform to speed up the process on E15,” one industry source with knowledge of the matter said. One other source said that the EPA had already decided to delay the credit trading limits. “They separated the RIN reform to ensure that the (E15) rule would get done in a timely manner,” the source said. The sources asked not to be named discussing the matter.  The agency is still working to release its draft rule for E15 by the end of the month, possibly within days, and is planning to expedite the rule-making process to finish it by June when seasonal driving demand picks up. The recent partial government shutdown in the United States had raised concerns the effort might not be completed on time because agency workers were furloughed. Bill Wehrum, a senior EPA official, in charge of the department drafting the rule, said the agency would still make it ready for summer driving season.

2019-02-12,"MOMBASA, Kenya, Feb 12 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - It was 6pm when an unusual rainbow-coloured boat, made of recycled plastic waste and discarded flip-flops gathered from beaches and roadsides, dropped anchor off the beach at Mtwapa, near Kenya’s coastal city of Mombasa. The 9-metre-long dhow, “The Flipflopi”, was sailing south along East Africa’s coast to raise awareness of the threat plastics pose to the oceans, said chief boat-builder and captain Ali Skanda. Beaches and marine ecosystems have been badly affected by plastics, Skanda said, adding it was time to change local people’s mindset on how they handle and dispose of waste. “That’s why we started this voyage - to reach out to communities in East Africa, and also globally,” he said. The boat’s voyage took it 500 km (311 miles) south from Lamu island in Kenya to Zanzibar in neighbouring Tanzania over two weeks starting on Jan. 23. Along the way the boat made six stops, with its crew joining local people, schools and officials for beach clean-ups and events highlighting the effect of plastic pollution on the seas. The motivation for boat-builder and fisherman Hassan Mohammed, 56, was seeing how much has changed in recent decades. Until 20 years ago, the shore at Mtwapa was free of pollution, he said. But tourism has meant increased use of plastic carrier bags and bottles, which has harmed the ocean. “When I started fishing, the only people around were fishermen and fisherwomen - and we used woven baskets and no plastics,” he said. “Nowadays, many people have started local businesses, like hotels along the shores, and contributed to a huge mess - as you can see, the place is littered with plastic bottles,” he added. The Flipflopi, built from 10 tonnes of plastic waste, was first launched late last year. Co-founder Ben Morison told the Thomson Reuters Foundation he began working on the project in 2016 “to transmit the message about the impact that plastic is having on marine ecosystems, how this affects us, and most important of all, what we can do about it”. Researchers estimate the world has produced more than 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic since the early 1950s, according to UN Environment. Of all plastic waste, just 9 percent has been recycled, its website says. About 12 percent was incinerated, while the rest ended up in dumps, landfill or loose in the environment. In partnership with the Flipflopi-Clean Seas campaign, the Mombasa County government committed to help keep plastic waste off its beaches by closing its biggest dump, Kibarani, and turning it into a natural space by planting trees. UN Environment has been working with the local government to clean up and rehabilitate the Kibarani dump, which has emptied waste into the ocean for 50 years, according to Mombasa County Governor Hassan Joho. The area’s importance as a tourism destination meant there was a need for proper waste management, he said. “We have serious historical damages to our environment that we need to deal with - the amount of plastics waste that was here was unbelievable,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “We decided to change this, (but) Kibarani is just a fraction,” he said, adding Mombasa needs $20 million each financial year to efficiently manage its waste. Still, “we are happy we are on the right track”, Joho added. Africa faces a significant funding gap - of up to $40 billion - in tackling waste management, said Juliette Biao Koudenoukpo, the director of UN Environment’s Africa office. The continent’s municipal solid waste generation, currently 125 million tonnes annually, is expected to double by 2025 due to changing purchasing habits and rapid urbanisation, she added. “We are struggling in Africa because waste management isn’t our priority,” she said. “Waste is a threat to biodiversity, (but) it’s possible to transform this threat into opportunity - we can recycle and create jobs.” The effort to clean up Kibarani has already changed the attitude of 24-year-old dump-site worker Lilian Ayuma. “Since I started working here I have become environmentally conscious, and I cannot haphazardly throw garbage around at home,” she said. The private sector is key to finding solutions to plastic pollution through reusing plastic and developing alternatives, said Joyce Gachugi-Waweru, country manager at PETCO, Kenya’s national industry body for plastic recycling. “The recycling industry could provide jobs for young people, generate wealth and safeguard the environment,” she added. Kenya’s government has been proactive in the fight against plastic pollution, banning the manufacture, sale and use of plastic bags in 2017. At an international conference on building a “sustainable blue economy”, hosted by Kenya in November, governments and experts committed to improving the health of oceans, seas, lakes and rivers, while harnessing their potential to create jobs. The FlipFlopi’s expedition came ahead of the United Nations Environment Assembly in March, where more than 190 nations will discuss innovative solutions to make production and consumption greener, and other critical environmental challenges. The boat will be on show in Nairobi during the gathering. The Flipflopi arrived in Stone Town, Zanzibar, on Feb. 7, eliciting pledges in its ports of call by 29 establishments, including 22 hotels, to minimise their plastic waste. “The voyage itself, and innovative spirit behind it, are symbolic of what we can do to make a difference,” Seif Ali Iddi, second vice-president of Zanzibar, said in a statement. Zanzibar - a popular resort island - is committed to the fight against plastic pollution and will work closely with its citizens to find solutions, he added. Skanda, meanwhile, is looking forward to undertaking more such voyages around Africa in the fight against plastic waste. “We are still fundraising to build a bigger boat so that we (can) sail to Cape Town in South Africa and to (all of) Africa,"" he added.

2019-02-12,"(Reuters) - Foreign partners of Venezuela’s PDVSA are facing pressure from the state-run oil firm to publicly declare whether they will continue as minority stakeholders in Orinoco Belt projects following U.S. sanctions, three people familiar with the matter said. The sanctions on Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), imposed last month in an attempt to dislodge Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, barred access to U.S. financial networks and oil supplies for the PDVSA joint ventures, pressuring Venezuela’s already falling crude output and exports. PDVSA’s Orinoco Belt joint venture partners, mostly U.S. or European companies, are facing difficulties getting cashflow out of the country as a result of the sanctions, straining their ability to continue production and exports. PDVSA has been in talks with the companies to persuade them to commit publicly to the joint ventures, the sources said in recent days. France’s Total SA, Norway’s Equinor ASA, Russia’s Rosneft and U.S.-based Chevron hold minority stakes in joint ventures with PDVSA that produce crude and operate oil upgraders capable of converting Venezuela’s extra-heavy oil into exportable grades. PDVSA did not reply to a request for comment. On Monday, Venezuelan Oil Minister and PDVSA head Manuel Quevedo said on a visit to India that relations with international oil companies including Chevron were continuing.   A manager at Rosneft said last week that the company did not expect oil output to decline at its projects in Venezuela this year, adding that the company saw the current situation in Venezuela as temporary. Rosneft did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. The four crude upgraders are capable of converting up to 700,000 barrels per day. The oil is exported by the joint ventures and each partner receives its share of the exports.  Total believes it can stay in Venezuela, its Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said on Monday, although last week the company said its bank accounts were blocked and it had evacuated its foreign employees. Rosneft has continued working normally at its Petromonagas joint venture with PDVSA, according to the sources. Equinor declined to comment on operational issues, referring questions to Petrocedeno, its joint venture with PDVSA. Chevron’s operations in Venezuela are continuing, a spokesman said on Monday, reiterating that the company was committed “to the country’s energy development in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.”  Even if the companies commit to Venezuela, their ability to produce could be crimped by the sanctions. Last week PDVSA ordered Petrocedeno to halt oil production and upgrading, due to a lack of naphtha to dilute the extra-heavy crude, according to sources from the project. The Petrocedeno-PDVSA venture’s 220,000-bpd upgrader was already out of service when the decision was made, one of the people said. It is unclear when oil output will be halted. PDVSA is studying if the other joint ventures in the Orinoco will have to halt operations, with diluent supplies dwindling, the people said.  India’s Reliance and PDVSA’s U.S. unit Citgo Petroleum are the main suppliers of naphtha to Venezuela, according to internal PDVSA data. Those flows have declined since sanctions took effect on Jan. 28, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.

2019-02-12,"(Adds quote, detail, NordStream 2) BERLIN, Feb 12 (Reuters) - German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Tuesday he was optimistic that Germany would build two terminals in the foreseeable future to import liquefied natural gas (LNG). As Germany phases out nuclear power and coal, it is increasingly turning to gas to compliment renewable energy sources. It is under pressure, especially from the United States, to cut its dependence on Russian gas and buy in LNG. Altmaier told a meeting with German and U.S. energy officials and industry lobbyists that Germany was weighing up the extent of state subsidies and regulations before private investors build the terminals needed for LNG imports. Of three sites under consideration - Brunsbuettel, Stade and Wilhelmshaven - Altmaier was confident terminals would be built at two in the foreseeable future. “All three projects are (being) carefully considered and examined,” he said. “I am quite optimistic that at least two of the terminals will be realised within a very foreseeable period of time.” Altmaier made clear that the question of LNG was a separate issue to Nord Stream 2 pipeline, backed by Germany, which will bring Russian gas to Europe under the Baltic Sea, bypassing Ukrainian pipelines. Ukraine is concerned that the 1,225 km (760 mile) pipeline will lead to a dramatic loss in transport revenues but Germany is trying to reassure Kiev that gas will still be transported from Russia through Ukraine’s existing pipeline. “The intention is to come as soon as possible ... to a new agreement between Russia and Ukraine,” he said.

2019-02-12,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Qatari sovereign wealth fund’s acquisition of a stake in Russia’s Rosneft sets the stage for collaboration between the Russian oil major and Qatar Petroleum, Doha’s ambassador to Moscow said in an interview with Reuters. The Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) became a shareholder in Rosneft following the Russian state-controlled oil giant’s privatization in late 2016, and now holds a 19 percent stake. Though Qatar is a small oil producer compared to its massive gas production, state oil firm Qatar Petroleum is on a drive to expand operations globally. Qatar’s ambassador to Russia, Fahad bin Mohamed Al-Attiyah, said QIA’s stake opened the door to cooperation between Rosneft and Qatar Petroleum in projects around the world.  “There is no ‘malicious agenda’,” Al-Attiyah said. “Just pure economic reasons.” Qatar is seeking international partnerships amid a boycott imposed by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, which severed diplomatic and transport ties with the country in 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism. Doha denies the charge. Qatar’s joint projects with other energy firms do not raise eyebrows, he said. “So then why is there a question mark when we have a collaboration with Rosneft?” Reuters reported last year that Russian state bank VTB secretly loaned around $6 billion to QIA to help finance its acquisition of the Rosneft stake, undermining the deal’s stated aim of bringing foreign money into Russia. Rosneft denied the report. Al-Attiyah said he did not know whether Russian funds were used to finance the deal. Qatar could sell the stake but was unlikely to do so soon, he said.  “We did not invest that much of a stake into this company to flip just like this, very quickly,” Al-Attiyah said.  The United States has called on Qatar, one of the world’s top suppliers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), to challenge Russian gas dominance in Europe. But the tiny Gulf nation will not be at loggerheads with Russia over the European market on political grounds, Al-Attiyah said. “We are ... in the space of the same commodity and we do want to expand our markets,” he said. “If that expansion comes within the natural course of economic partnership, then absolutely fine.” “But if it comes within the context of any political rivalry, then absolutely we will say no to that ... Why try to push somebody out?” Qatar could also partner in Russian LNG projects, though participation in Novatek’s Arctic LNG 2 has not come up in discussions, he said. Al-Attiyah confirmed that Qatar was in talks about buying Russian air defense systems, but said no contracts had been signed due to sanctions on Russian military exports. The sanctions “created considerable concern”, Al-Attiyah said. Saudi Arabia previously threatened to take military action if Qatar installed the Russian S-400 air defense system. “We don’t tell the Saudis what they should buy,” Al-Attiyah said. “And we won’t let them interfere in our relationships with Russia.” Writing by Polina Ivanova; Editing by Dale Hudson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/russia-qatar/qatari-stake-in-rosneft-paves-way-for-global-energy-deals-doha-envoy-idUKL5N2064OE,12 Feb 2019,"The Qatari sovereign wealth

2019-02-12,"* Nigeria emerged from recession in 2017 * Growth remains sluggish * Presidential election to be held on Feb. 16 * President touts infrastructure as path to growth * Opposition candidate wants expanded private sector role By Alexis Akwagyiram LAGOS, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Timi Soleye returned home to Nigeria from the United States to set up a gas logistics business six years ago, encouraged by predictions of growth and an expanding middle class. Three years later, Nigeria plunged into its first recession in a generation following a sharp fall in the price of oil, which accounts for 90 percent of its foreign exchange earnings. Infrastructure projects on which Soleye’s business relied were shelved. He kept afloat by doing consultancy work, but others weren’t so lucky. “I know lots of people whose companies shut and laid people off,” said Soleye, a 31-year-old Harvard graduate and president of CRYO Gas and Power. Soleye didn’t bother to vote in 2015. But this year, he says he has a reason to do so: he doesn’t want President Muhammadu Buhari to win a second term on Feb. 16. “Enough is enough,” he said. Buhari’s critics accuse him of failing on a number of issues, including promises to tackle corruption and defeat an Islamist insurgency that has killed thousands since he took the helm of Africa’s most populous nation. But his handling of the economy could cost Buhari more votes than any other issue. Although Nigeria returned to growth in 2017, the economy expanded by 1.9 percent in 2018, compared with 5.5 percent when Soleye returned to Nigeria in 2013. Inflation has been in double digits for the last three years, rising to a seven-month high of 11.4 percent in December. And nearly a quarter of the workforce - 23.1 percent - is unemployed, up from 18.1 percent a year earlier. “People are still worse off after four years in power,” said Charles Robertson, chief economist at Renaissance Capital. “It’s not all Buhari’s fault. It’s mainly to do with oil. But nonetheless, it’s made it difficult for people to be positive about the economy.” For Clement Nweke, who sells electrical appliances in a Lagos street market, the last few years have been hard. Inflation and a weaker currency mean 100,000 naira ($330) will only buy one of his air conditioning units, compared with three back in 2015. “The purchasing power from the public is lower,” he said. “It affects my own business because I don’t push out the many (units) I used to.” Buhari’s main rival, businessman and former vice president Atiku Abubakar, has zeroed in on the issue. “Get Nigeria working again,” is his campaign slogan. He has vowed to double the size of the economy to $900 billion by 2025, mainly by giving a larger role to the private sector. Buhari argues that the way to bigger growth is through infrastructure development, touting railway and road construction. But many business leaders doubt he can fix the economy, saying their companies have been hurt by government efforts to help the poor. “In their quest for what they call affordability, they have essentially price regulated a huge bevy of things, and they do not see that, ironically, it makes things more expensive,” said Soleye. He said a decision to fix energy tariffs for three years meant that while customers were getting cheap electricity, crippling debts were piling up in Nigeria’s power sector. Those debts have held up construction of new plants for which Soleye’s company would have provided gas storage and pipelines. Another often-cited example is the government’s decision to ban rice imports through its land borders in 2015. Instead, the government subsidised tractors, mills and fertiliser and arranged cheaper loans to boost domestic rice production. But farmers struggled to meet demand, hampered by poor roads to bring their harvest to market and inadequate power for storage facilities. Prices soared. The only people who did well were smugglers, said Rotimi Williams, who owns a rice farm in the central state of Nasarawa. “The cost of production of local rice has increased, which means that people are going for cheaper imported rice,” he said. He blames protectionist policies for Nigeria’s galloping inflation. The government says it is trying to wean the economy off its reliance on oil sales by encouraging domestic production of everything from wheat to cars. Some local businesses have profited. Etop Ikpe, CEO of Cars45, an online marketplace for used vehicles, said a decision to increase a tariff on imported vehicles from 20 to 70 percent in 2015 “provided an opportunity”. “People couldn’t afford brand new cars or imported used cars,” he said. But as with rice, the Nigerian ports authority reported a surge in car smuggling from neighbouring Benin, and local assembly did not pick up. Buhari’s supporters point out that Nigeria rose 24 places to 145 in the World Bank’s ease of doing business ranking in 2017, largely due to government efforts to cut red tape, including issuing visas on arrival and establishing a centralized electronic system to pay federal taxes. “One good term deserves another,” says an electronic billboard for Buhari in the Lagos business district of Victoria Island. How voters respond may depend on whether they believe they will be better off with Atiku, who as vice president from 1999 to 2007 oversaw the liberalisation of Nigeria’s telecommunications industry. Foreign investors have welcomed his pledges to float the naira, overhaul the central bank, privatise the state oil company and create a $25 billion fund to support private sector infrastructure investment. The central bank, with Buhari’s backing, imposed currency restrictions in 2015 to defend the naira, rejecting bankers’ advice to float the currency as some other oil exporters had done. The following year, the naira lost a third of its value, and many investors fled. Capital imports into Nigeria, which stood at $21.32 billion in 2013, fell to $5.12 billion in 2016, before rising to $12.2 billion as the country emerged from recession in 2017. “If we want to see the unemployment rates coming down and certain initiatives that will boost growth, primarily it will be private sector driven,” said Boye Olawoye, group managing director of investment bank Primera Africa.

Tokyo’s Nikkei set the tone with its best day of the year so far and Europe wasted little time in trying to lift the STOXX 600 back to the two-month high it set last week. Germany’s DAX jumped more than 1.2 percent, after rising 1 percent on Monday, and Paris and Milan were up 0.8 percent, while London’s FTSE approached a four-month peak despite ongoing Brexit uncertainty. The dollar hovered at a two-month high and the Australian dollar also gained. The yen and Swiss franc dipped while U.S. Treasury and German bund yields edged up as investors jettisoned safe havens. “We have had two bits of relatively good news overnight - optimism about the U.S. shutdown not resuming and optimism about a trade deal,” said Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes. “Equities are higher, bond yields are a little bit higher, yen and Swiss franc weakest overnight of the major currencies so it’s sort of risk-on rules OK!” Juckes said he reckoned there was now a 75 percent chance that a ratcheting up of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods at the start of March will be avoided and a 95 percent chance that another U.S. government shutdown will be dodged. Those odds got a boost on Monday after U.S. lawmakers reached a tentative deal on border security funding, though aides cautioned that it did not contain the $5.7 billion President Donald Trump wants to build a wall on the Mexican border. S&P 500 e-mini futures were up nearly 0.5 percent, pointing to a solid start on Wall Street later after a choppy day on Monday. U.S. and Chinese officials expressed hopes the new round of talks, which began in Beijing on Monday, would bring them closer to easing their months-long trade war. Beijing and Washington are trying to hammer out a deal before a March 1 deadline, without which U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports are scheduled to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent. “There will be no winner in a trade war. So at some point they will likely strike a deal,” said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities in Tokyo. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.3 percent. Shanghai rose 0.35 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI climbed 0.6 percent and Australian shares gained 0.3 percent. The Nikkei rallied though, shooting up 2.6 percent after closing on Friday at its lowest level since early January. The Tokyo market was closed on Monday. With the yen backtracking again, shares of exporters such as automakers and machinery makers led the charge. Separately, Deutsche Bank noted it was 20 years since Japan cut interest rates to zero, something now standard in large parts of Europe. The dollar held firm, having gained for eight straight sessions against a basket of six major currencies until Monday, its longest rally in two years. Although the Federal Reserve’s dovish turn dented the dollar earlier this month, some analysts noted the U.S. currency still has the highest yield among major peers and that the Fed continues to shrink its balance sheet. “The dollar is the market’s pet currency at present regardless of whether concerns about the global economy are on the rise,” currency strategists at Commerzbank said in a note. The dollar popped up to a six-week high of 110.65 yen . In contrast, the euro dropped to as low as $1.1267, its weakest in 2-1/2 months, and last traded at $1.1277. In commodity markets, oil prices also ticked up as traders weighed support from OPEC-led supply restraint and a slowdown in the global economy. U.S. crude futures traded at $52.68 per barrel, up 0.5 percent. Brent crude rose 0.6 percent to $61.89 per barrel. Gold was a touch stronger at $1,312 an ounce.

2019-02-12,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The number of jobs in the U.S. solar industry dropped by 3.2 percent in 2018, a second year of losses, as the Trump administration’s tariffs on foreign panels and state-level policy changes hit demand for installations, according to an industry report released on Tuesday. The job losses reflect how changing trade and environmental policies can alter the trajectory of an industry that was among the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. energy industry. The number of solar energy workers fell by 8,000 to 242,000 in 2018, according to the Solar Jobs Census, released annually by the non-profit research firm The Solar Foundation, following a loss of 10,000 jobs in 2017. But jobs are expected to rise next year, the report said. In early 2018, President Donald Trump imposed 30 percent tariffs on imported solar panels to boost domestic manufacturing, the opening salvo in what has become a wide-ranging trade war. The move led developers to cancel or freeze billions of dollars of investments in large-installation projects because most of the solar panels used in the United States are made abroad. On the manufacturing side, there is little evidence so far of a boost. Jobs in the industry’s manufacturing sector - a small slice of the overall industry - fell 8 percent in 2018, according to the report.  Policies of U.S. states are also critical to solar growth, and changes in incentives and rates for projects in large markets led to job losses there, according to the report. In California, utility procurement slowed because power companies have fulfilled near-term renewable energy procurement requirements. The state’s commercial market also slowed due to a shift to rates that are less favorable to solar. In Massachusetts, the commercial market stalled ahead of the introduction of a new incentive scheme at the end of the year.  The Solar Foundation said it expects a rebound in jobs of 7 percent next year, however, due to recent declines in solar panel prices that have made them more affordable. China last year slashed subsidies for solar installations, unleashing a flood of low-cost Chinese-made panels onto the international market and pushing prices below what they were before the tariffs were imposed. Installation will receive the biggest bump, more than 9 percent, the report said, while manufacturing will rise 4 percent, the report said.  JinkoSolar Holding Co Ltd, Hanwha Q CELLS, and some others are opening U.S. factories to avoid U.S. tariffs.

2019-02-12,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cautioned allies on Monday against deploying equipment from Chinese telecoms giant Huawei on their soil, saying it would make it more difficult for Washington to “partner alongside them”. The United States and its Western allies believe Huawei Technologies’ apparatus could be used for espionage, and see its expansion into central Europe as a way to gain a foothold in the EU market. Washington is concerned in particular about the expansion of Huawei, the world’s biggest maker of telecoms equipment, in Hungary and Poland.  “We want to make sure we identify (to) them the opportunities and the risks of using that equipment,” Pompeo told reporters during a visit to Budapest. Hungary is the first stop in a trip by Pompeo to central Europe that also includes Slovakia and Poland and is part of what administration officials say is an effort to make up for a lack of U.S. engagement in the region that opened the door to more Chinese and Russian influence.     Huawei denies engaging in intelligence work for any government. It says its technologies serve 70 percent of Hungarians and that it cooperates with most telecoms providers in Hungary, including state-owned enterprises. “We have seen this all around the world. It also makes it more difficult for America to be present,” Pompeo told reporters during a stop at the U.S. embassy, referring to Huawei equipment. “If that equipment is co-located where we have important American systems, it makes it more difficult for us to partner alongside them.” Pompeo announced plans for a defence cooperation agreement with Hungary, one of the European governments that is most enthusiastic about Chinese investment. But he said he had discussed “the dangers of allowing China to gain a bridgehead in Hungary” in talks with Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto. Budapest’s nationalist government, like Poland’s largely isolated politically in the European Union, hopes to buy mid-range air defence capabilities from the United States. In Poland, where Pompeo is travelling on Tuesday, the government is considering banning Huawei from participating in the development of 5G capabilities after arresting a Chinese employee of Huawei and a former Polish security official on spying allegations last month. Both men have denied wrongdoing. It is also lobbying Washington for an increased military presence on its soil. Slovakia, which Pompeo visits before Poland, is looking to buy F-16 fighter jets. Pompeo’s tour includes a conference on the Middle East, hosted by Poland, where Washington hopes to build a coalition against Iran. He is also expected to voice concerns about energy ties with Moscow, and urge Hungary not to support the TurkStream pipeline, part of the Kremlin’s plans to bypass Ukraine, the main transit route for Russian gas to Europe. Hungary gets most of its gas from Russia and its main domestic source of electricity is the Paks nuclear power plant where Russia’s Rosatom is involved in a 12.5 billion-euro ($14 billion) expansion.  Hungary’s Szijjarto brushed off U.S. concerns over Russia and China, saying Budapest was fulfilling its obligations to Western allies as a member of the NATO military alliance. “When it comes to cooperation with Russia or cooperation with the People’s Republic of China, that does not harm us being reliable as a NATO ally,” he told a joint news conference with his U.S. counterpart. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters in Beijing on Tuesday that China appreciated Szijjarto’s “independent, fair and objective” comments, and that China-Hungary ties would not be damaged or interfered with by other countries.  The United States’ actions to “suppress” Chinese companies’ legitimate development interests were “extremely unfair and immoral”, and were unbecoming of a great power, Hua said.  Pompeo also discussed concerns over the rule of law in Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban is pressuring courts, media and non-governmental groups. Earlier in the day Pompeo met with civil society leaders at the U.S. Embassy and said he would discuss their treatment directly with Orban.  “So many of the concerns that are voiced are things that have happened in the absence of America being engaged,” he told reporters. Szijjarto drew parallels between the Trump administration and Orban government on curbing immigration, protecting Christians around the world and support for Israel. “Hungary’s government and President Donald Trump’s administration represent an identical, or very similar, approaches in both general political and numerous international political issues,” he said.

2019-02-12,"(Repeats with no change to text) By Panu Wongcha-um BANGKOK, Feb 11 (Reuters) - The political career of Thailand’s Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Barnavadi lasted only three days, but in that time her declaration that she would be a candidate for prime minister in a March election shook up the kingdom. For the sister of King Maha Vajiralongkorn to enter politics was shocking enough, but what threatened to upend Thailand’s political dynamic was the fact that she declared her candidacy for a populist party linked to an exiled former prime minister. By Monday, the country’s Election Commission had disqualified the princess, 67, from taking part in the election, echoing the words of the king himself, who said on Friday her candidacy was “inappropriate”. Still, even though the princess won’t be a candidate in the March 24 vote, her political ambitions - and the populists’ audacious gambit in nominating her - could linger in voters’ minds. The election is the first since a 2014 military coup, and will pit allies of ousted ex-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra against urban and middle class opponents espousing extreme devotion to the Thai monarchy. Thaksin or his proxies have won every election in Thailand since 2001. With its nomination of the king’s sister for prime minister, the Thai Raksa Chart party sought to flip the longstanding charge by opponents that Thaksin and his allies were insufficiently loyal to the monarchy. The royal family is revered in Thailand as semi-divine. Insulting the monarchy is against the law, punished by up to 15 years in prison. By longstanding tradition, the royal family have kept themselves above politics as a symbol of Thai culture. Since 2005, when protesters drawn mostly from the middle-class and urban establishment began demonstrating against Thaksin’s rule, the rallying call of anti-Thaksin forces has been to protect the monarchy. The early protesters wore yellow - a colour associated with the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej - to show their reverence for the monarchy and Thai culture that they said Thaksin threatened through corruption and consolidating his own personal power. The military deposed Thaksin in 2006 and, since then, Thai politics have been locked in a cycle of his allies winning elections and later being ousted from power by court rulings or coups - most recently in 2014, when the army overthrew the remnants of a government that had been led by Thaksin’s sister Yingluck. Nominating Princess Udolratana was Thai Raksa Chart’s attempt to turn the table and invoke the appeal of the royal family as a populist princess. But the gambit was quickly shut down by her brother, who ascended to the throne in 2016, after the death of their father, and will be officially crowned in May. Still, the brief entry of royalty into politics may only deepen Thailand’s political divisions, said Anusorn Unno, Dean of the Faculty of Sociology and Anthropology at Thammasat University. “For Thai Raksa Chart supporters, this has created more sympathy to the party ... These would see the party as a victim in this situation,” he said. As for Thaksin’s opponents, they are likely to be galvanised by what they will see as an attempt to manipulate the monarchy, said Anusorn.

2019-02-12,"* Small particulate matter in 39 cities rises in Jan * Worst performers saw surge in steel, power, cement output * Cities could struggle to meet winter air quality targets By David Stanway SHANGHAI, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Air pollution in 39 major northern Chinese cities rose 16 percent on the year in January, official data showed, with surging industrial activity making it increasingly unlikely they will meet their winter emissions targets. Average concentrations of small, hazardous particles known as PM2.5 in two major northern Chinese emissions control zones climbed 16 percent from a year earlier to 114 micrograms per cubic metre, according to Reuters analysis of official pollution data. China has vowed not to ease up when it comes to fighting pollution even amid an economic slump, but rising emissions of lung-damaging smog last month suggests that some provinces could struggle to balance that goal with an upturn in industrial production. “The reasons for the increases in PM2.5 levels are not hard to identify,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, energy analyst with environmental group Greenpeace, who noted that steel, thermal power and cement production surged throughout the region in the final quarter of 2018. “The outsourcing of industrial output that took place last winter in order for Beijing to hit its air quality targets was reversed this winter, driving air pollution levels up in the region while the rest of the country has seen improvements.” The worst performer over the month was the coal city of Linfen in Shanxi province, which saw average PM2.5 levels of 174 micrograms, up 23 percent from a year earlier. Shijiazhuang, the provincial capital of Hebei, China’s biggest steelmaking region, also saw emissions rise 30 percent to 144 micrograms. China’s official air quality standard is 35 micrograms, while the World Health Organization recommends an annual average of no more than 10. Over the three months beginning in November 2018, when coal-fired heating systems are switched on throughout the north, average PM2.5 in the 39 cities reached 93.5 micrograms, up 12 percent on the year. Anyang, a coal and steel producing city in Henan province, was the worst performer over that period, with average concentrations at 124 micrograms, up 27 percent. Henan has blamed its poor performance this winter on “unfavourable weather conditions”. China’s environment ministry did not respond to a request for comment. However, senior official Liu Bingjiang told reporters last month that local governments would be held fully accountable for any failures, regardless of the weather. Most of the cities are aiming to cut pollution by 3 percent compared to 12 months earlier, far lower than last year’s target of around 15 percent. The compliance period also began a month earlier in October, when pollution is normally much lower. However, they are still struggling to meet targets. “With four months of the October-March period passed and two to go, it would take a very steep 20-percent reduction in February-March to get to the 3-percent reduction target,” said Myllyvirta.

2019-02-12,"(Reuters) - U.S. glass container maker Owens-Illinois Inc has sued Venezuela and state-owned companies as it seeks to collect a $500 million arbitration award over the 2010 nationalization of two plants, according to a lawsuit filed on Monday. Owens-Illinois was granted the award in 2015 by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, which said the company was entitled to $372 million plus interest, the filing in the U.S. District Court in Delaware showed. The lawsuit names state oil firm Petroleos de Venezuela SA PDVSA and its U.S. refining unit Citgo Petroleum Corp, claiming that they are “alter egos, and mere instrumentalities of Venezuela itself.” The cash-strapped Venezuelan government has little in the way of offshore assets, which has encouraged creditors to consider creative ways to collect. In November, Venezuela reached a deal with Canadian mining firm Crystallex International Corp that had sought to collect an arbitration award against Venezuela by seizing Citgo via a court order. The government agreed to pay $1.2 billion in installments to protect Citgo. PDVSA in August agreed a $2 billion settlement with ConocoPhillips after the U.S. producer had seized PDVSA Caribbean assets in an attempt to enforce its claim. Previous agreements by the Venezuelan government and its state-run companies over dozens of arbitrations and legal claims related to late socialist President Hugo Chavez’s nationalizations have mostly ended in renegotiations and legal disputes. PDVSA and Citgo did not respond to requests for comment outside regular working hours. It is unclear whether the case could be affected by U.S. sanctions against PDVSA, amid an intense power struggle for control in Venezuela between President Nicolas Maduro and self-declared head of state Juan Guaido.

2019-02-12,"* OPEC cuts, U.S. sanctions tighten supply for heavy crude * Economic concerns hold market in check * Surge in U.S. supply caps prices By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up on Tuesday amid OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions against Iran and Venezuela, although surging U.S. production and concerns over economic growth kept markets in check. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $52.60 per barrel at 0043 GMT, up 19 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last close. International Brent crude futures had yet to trade. Analysts warn that markets are tightening amid voluntary production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and because of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran. But some said that supply-side risks were not receiving enough focus. “We believe that oil is not pricing in supply side risks lately as markets are currently focused on U.S.-China trade talks, ignoring the risks currently in place from the loss of Venezuelan barrels,” U.S. bank J.P. Morgan said in a weekly note. Should U.S.-China talks to end trade disputes between the two nations have a positive outcome, the bank said oil markets would “switch attention from macro concerns impacting future demand growth to physical tightness and geopolitical risks impacting immediate supply”. But surging U.S. supply and a potential economic slowdown this year could cap oil markets. “The worries of oversupply stemming from the U.S. will likely remain a dominant theme as we approach the warmer months,” said Edward Moya, market analyst at futures brokerage OANDA. U.S. bank Morgan Stanley said the surge in U.S. crude oil production, which tends to be light in quality and which rose by more than 2 million barrels per day (bpd) last year to a record 11.9 million bpd C-OUT-T-EIA, had resulted in overproduction of gasoline. “Light crudes naturally yield more gasoline, and together with relatively modest demand-growth, this has driven gasoline stocks sharply higher and crack spreads sharply lower in recent months,” Morgan Stanley said. Refining profits for gasoline have plunged since mid-2018, going negative in Asia and Europe, amid tepid demand growth and a surge in supply. As a result, Morgan Stanley said “low refining margins and weaker economic data means oil prices can rally only so much (and) we continue to see modest upside for Brent to $65 per barrel in the second-half (of 2019)”.
