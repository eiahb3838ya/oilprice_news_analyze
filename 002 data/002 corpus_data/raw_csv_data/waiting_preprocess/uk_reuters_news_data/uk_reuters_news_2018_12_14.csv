2018-12-14,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Stocks worldwide tumbled on Friday after weak economic data from China and Europe fanned concerns of a global economic slowdown and left investors fretting over the wider impact of a still-unresolved Sino-U.S. trade dispute. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks stocks across 47 countries, was down over half a percent by afternoon in Europe. Futures indicated a weak open on Wall Street. Euro zone business ended the year on a weak note, expanding at the slowest pace in over four years as new order growth all but dried up, hurt by trade tensions and violent protests in France, a survey showed. Another survey showed French business activity plunged unexpectedly into contraction this month, retreating at the fastest pace in over four years in the face of violent anti-government protests. Germany’s private sector expansion slowed to a four-year low, meanwhile, suggesting growth in Europe’s largest economy may be weak in the final quarter. The data out of Europe added to weak readings from China, where November retail sales grew at the weakest pace since 2003 and industrial output rose the least in nearly three years, underlining risks to the economy as Beijing works to defuse a trade dispute with the United States. Stock markets in Europe fell sharply, with Germany’s DAX index falling by as much as 1-1/2 percent. It was last down 0.8 percent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was last down 0.8 percent, after falling over 1 percent earlier. “The data this morning out of France really hasn’t helped the mood. You look at China data, you look at the flash PMIs out of France and Germany and they’ve really sort of reinforced concerns that the global economy is slowing down,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. “Ultimately, I think it rather questions the wisdom of the ECB ending its asset purchase programme at the end of this month. You’ve got Mario Draghi basically tightening into a downturn.” MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.5 percent. Japan’s Nikkei, also dragged down by the country’s weak tankan sentiment index, dropped 2.0 percent. China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite and the blue-chip CSI 300 closed down 1.5 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was off 1.5 percent. A Chinese statistics bureau spokesman said the November data showed downward pressure on the economy is increasing. “The market’s softer after Chinese retail sales. They’re still quite stellar growth, they were lower than expected and enough to concern the market,” said Edward Park, investment director at Brooks Macdonald. The Chinese yuan weakened 0.4 percent to 6.9020 per dollar in offshore trade following the data. Overnight on Wall Street, the S&P 500 ticked down 0.02 percent to 2,650, not far from its 6-1/2-month closing low of 2,633 touched on Nov. 23, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.39 percent. U.S. corporate earnings due next month could throw a spotlight on the impact from the U.S. tariffs on imports from China, while there is risk of a government shutdown and further political stalemate in a divided U.S. congress, Kuramochi added. In the currency market, the euro was down 0.7 percent after the weak PMIs, last changing hands at $1.1293. Sterling fell more than half a percent to below $1.26 after Prime Minister Theresa May returned from a visit to Brussels, where she failed to win assurances from European Union leaders over her Brexit withdrawal agreement. The European Union has said the agreed Brexit deal is not open for renegotiation even though its leaders on Thursday gave May assurances that they would seek to agree a new pact with Britain by 2021 so that the contentious Irish “backstop” is never triggered. The dollar stood at 113.61 yen, down 0.1 percent on the day but above this week’s low of 112.245 set on Monday. Oil prices fell after China reported slower economic growth, pointing to lower fuel demand in the world’s biggest oil importer, although market sentiment was supported by supply cuts agreed last week by major crude producers. U.S. crude futures fell 0.7 percent to $52.22 per barrel and Brent crude slid 0.8 percent to $60.94, after both gained more than 2.5 percent on Thursday. Cryptocurrency Bitcoin fell as low as $3,200, a fresh 15-month low. A rash of bomb threats were emailed on Thursday to hundreds of businesses, public offices and schools across the United States and Canada demanding payment in cryptocurrency, but none of the threats appeared credible, law enforcement officials said.

2018-12-14,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Delegates at U.N. climate talks in the Polish city of Katowice point to the mining museum next to the conference venue as the proper place for coal, which provides 80 percent of the country’s electricity. Poland’s decision to host the negotiations to revive the 2015 Paris agreement on phasing out fossil fuel has laid bare the tension between high-minded goals and business realities. A short drive from the conference venue, at the Silesian region’s dozen or so remaining mines, tonnes of freshly dug coal thunder down shoots to be rail-roaded to power plants for carbon-intensive generation.    Coal bosses see a need to address climate risk, but say Poland must use thermal coal for electricity until it has a better option.     Silesia also produces coking coal, used in steel, and viewed as a strategic mineral even by the European Union, which seeks to be an environmental leader. Poland’s JSW, the European Union’s largest coking coal producer, is seeking to grow.  “The world has to tackle the increase of carbon dioxide emissions, but I do not see a chance the world can live without steel these days and there is not an easy solution to substitute steel and substitute coking coal,” CEO Daniel Ozon told Reuters. Financial backing can be an issue for all forms of coal and JSW has its eye on Chinese banks as international lenders are wary. For many Poles, coal mining symbolizes national independence.  State-dominated companies can look to a government striving to win over an electorate divided between an older generation that associates coal with a reliable income and a sense of community, and youths engaged in climate protests. As the demonstrators march, international business works to keep shareholders on side. One of the climate team from the world’s biggest producer of coking coal BHP was among business representatives taking part in the side events accompanying the negotiations. The U.N. talks have proved long and fractious, with flash-points including a revolt by Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United States and Kuwait against a major scientific report that laid out the reasons to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. “The real challenge is not whether it’s 2 degrees or 1.5 degrees; it’s that not enough is happening,” Graham Winkelman, BHP’s practice lead on climate change, said in an interview. BHP stands apart from other big miners with a goal to make its own operations carbon neutral, in line with the Paris agreement, by the second half of the century. But just as governments have to work out practicalities, it is also unclear how BHP can achieve its goals. “There is no definitive path-way,” Winkelman said, although he repeated a frequent industry request for a carbon price to help shift investment towards a greener technology. Poland’s aim is to share the challenges of bringing about a “just transition”, Polish Deputy Environment Minister Michal Kurtyka, who presided over the talks, said. As a graduate of Paris’ elite Ecole Polytechnique, a physicist, an economist and an engineer, his favored solution is electric vehicles. With fewer moving parts and less wasted heat than internal combustion engines, he says they will help even if they run on coal-fired power. As a citizen of a country that switched in 1989 from “a centrally planned to a market economy,” Kurtyka has first-hand experience of deep change. “In my young days, growing up in Krakow, that was a completely different city from now. At 8 p.m. the lights switched off. You could not open the window because of air pollution,” he said. In Katowice, some residents say they still can’t let the air in and are not confident that is about to change.

2018-12-14,"KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - F ossil fuel-dependent Ukraine will strengthen its climate change action plan under the Paris Agreement to curb global warming, its government said at U.N. climate talks in Poland this week. Four Ukrainian cities also reaffirmed their goal of shifting to 100 percent renewable energy by 2050, announced this year. Svitlana Romanko, Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia director for climate campaign 350.org, said Ukrainian citizens and mayors were showing that a rapid and fair transition to clean energy was “both possible and popular”. “The new national target should reflect and build on these cities’ climate and energy plans,” she added. Ukraine has pledged to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2030, under the 2015 Paris accord. By 2016, its emissions had already fallen 64 percent due to an economic collapse following the break-up of the Soviet Union. Ilya Eremenko, head of the Ukrainian Climate Network, said many cities had set their own goals for reducing emissions, which are far more ambitious than national ones. “A combination of national and local targets is crucial for effective climate policy,” he added. In June, the northwest Ukrainian city of Zhytomyr became the first city in the wider region to adopt a target of using 100 percent renewable energy by 2050, according to its mayor. Three other Ukrainian cities - Kamianets-Podilskyi, Chortkiv and Lviv - have since signed up to the same ambition. In Ukraine, energy is a crucial issue in both international and domestic politics, Zhytomyr Mayor Serhiy Sukhomlyn told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at September’s Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco. Moving to local, clean energy production would end dependence on imported fossil fuels, including natural gas, which can be exploited for political ends, he said. “Hundred percent renewable also means 100 percent energy independence,” Sukhomlyn said. Major rows have flared up several times with Russia over issues such as whether Ukraine siphoned off gas supplies for Europe as they were transported through Russia’s neighbouring state, as well as payments relating to gas supply and transit. Since Russia annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea in 2014, Ukraine imports gas mainly from other European countries, though some of that originates from Russia. And it is aiming to produce more from its own fields, including shale gas, in future. To help end Zhytomyr’s dependency on gas and other fossil fuels, it plans to build a 10-megawatt (MW) solar power plant by mid-2019, and add another 30 MW of solar capacity later. Today, renewable sources account for less than 1 percent of energy used by the city, known as the birthplace of Soviet rocket engineer Sergei Korolev, who played a lead role in launching the first human into space. Zhytomyr is also planning four micro-hydropower plants and three biofuel co-generation plants, replacing close to half the gas used by the city in the next few years. Sukhomlyn said the projects had been made possible by reforms to decentralise energy production in Ukraine. “Local authorities and municipalities are getting a lot of independence”, enabling them to develop partnerships with investors and international financial institutions, he said. The energy transition in the city of just over 250,000 people is supported by donors including Germany, Switzerland and Slovenia, as well as multilateral financial institutions. Sukhomlyn said the city plans to reduce energy consumption by at least 20 percent by 2050 and curb related emissions. To help achieve that, it will retrofit schools and other municipal buildings, put in new electric trolley buses, and use LED bulbs for street lighting. The district heating system will be modernised with boilers that run on biofuels including wood chips and farm waste. The city has also launched a programme to fund energy-efficient insulation for co-owned housing associations. The overall transformation aims to bring down energy prices for households by 10 percent, the city council said. Producing energy locally will be cheaper than importing gas, and efficiency measures will lower usage, it added. The economic rationale for going self-sufficient in energy is key to getting citizens onboard, said the mayor. “Fossil fuel prices have recently been increasing, and switching to local energy sources will provide stable and cheaper alternatives,” Sukhomlyn said. In 2012, Zhytomyr joined the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, an international coalition, and committed to reduce its carbon emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020. Two years later, a working group uniting city government experts, municipal energy companies, scientists and the public drafted a 10-year sustainable energy policy. Climate action group 350.org will help city authorities develop further plans for the transition to renewable energy and craft a climate strategy in 2019 together with inhabitants. “Public demand for clean energy is also an opportunity for city residents to have an influence over the decision makers on local climate and energy solutions,” said Romanko. Activists, meanwhile, have launched an app called “Climate Drops” that rewards green behaviour such as recycling and tree-planting. When residents bring plastic bottles to the recycling centre, for example, they receive points (or “drops”) via the app which can be traded for discounts in restaurants and stores. The app has spread to another 10 cities across the country and has about 1,000 active users. Excluding large hydropower dams, renewable energy accounts for less than 2 percent of Ukraine’s electricity production, said Komila Nabiyeva of Energy Watch Group, a Berlin-based network of scientists and parliamentarians. The government has set a 2020 target to generate 11 percent from renewable sources, but that includes hydropower, which already accounts for 7 percent, making the goal unambitious, said Nabiyeva. This year, Ukraine also published a low-emission development strategy through to 2050, aimed at helping work out how to boost renewable energy and implement energy efficiency measures, while modernising its electricity grid and transport infrastructure. Nabiyeva said a recent study by Energy Watch Group and Finland’s LUT University showed Ukraine’s electricity could be supplied entirely from local renewable energy sources - excluding large hydro dams - by 2050, which would be more cost-effective than today’s system based mainly on coal and nuclear. The government’s current energy strategy, which runs until 2026, prioritises growth in hydropower. While it is aimed at reducing coal-fired production, the plan could be thwarted by strong coal lobby groups, warned Ukrainian energy journalist Sergey Golovnev.

2018-12-14,"MOSCOW, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Palmali, one of the biggest players in Russia’s river-to-sea cargo market, plans to appeal against a court decision declaring its Russian business bankrupt and effectively handing its fleet over to Sberbank, the shipping firm’s owner said on Friday. Last month, a court in Rostov-on-Don in southern Russia declared the Palmali unit bankrupt. The unit owes $180 million to Sberbank, with almost all of its roughly 50 ships held as collateral with Russia’s largest bank. Palmali also owes 1.6 billion roubles ($24 million) to Russia’s tax authorities. Palmali’s owner, Mubariz Mansimov, told Reuters the company, which is headquartered in Istanbul and also operates in the Black and Mediterranean Seas, planned to challenge the ruling. “We will continue legal actions against Sberbank and tax authorities of the Russian Federation,” he added. “For some reasons, Sberbank didn’t want to restructure (our debt).” In an emailed reply to Reuters, Sberbank said bankruptcy proceeding were the best way to resolve the Palmali unit’s debt problems. “Meanwhile, we support the company’s willingness to continue its business as usual until after the bankruptcy process is finished, this would help to preserve the fleet and workers,” Sberbank said. Palmali has around 3,500 staff in Russia. The company has handled large volumes of non-pipeline oil and products exports, plying routes between refineries in the Volga region and Black and Azov Seas. One of its main clients is the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in southern Russia. However, it has suffered from cheaper transport options, such as railways and pipelines. River shipments in Russia, which include cargoes of grains and construction materials, oil products and cars, fell 6.4 percent in 2017 from the year before, according to KPMG. Western sanctions imposed for Moscow’s role in Ukraine’s crisis have also hit some shippers. Mansimov said the sanctions “paralysed” the firm, which uses the Russian flag on most of its vessels operating in Russia. “We can’t enter Ukraine with a Russian flag aboard. There is also pressure from the Western companies. They just don’t want to hand their cargoes to a Russian flag,” he said. $1 = 66.3917 roubles

2018-12-14,"KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Ministers are working around the clock to complete and strengthen the rules for making a landmark agreement to combat climate change operational, with one day of talks remaining. Delegates from nearly 200 nations are on a self-imposed deadline to produce a “rule book” to flesh out details of 2015 Paris Agreement which aims to limit the global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius and which comes into force in 2020. Talks in Katowice, Poland, under way since Dec. 2, have been clouded by political divisions and progress had been slow until some deadlocks were broken and draft texts produced overnight. The drafts show that there has been compromise in some areas, such as language to recognise the importance of a U.N. report on limiting global warming to 1.5C which caused rifts last week, and on finance. “We are entering the final lap. There are still people unhappy but basically it looks good. I think we will make it in the end but not everyone is satisfied yet,” said German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze. It will be a long night in the sprawling Spodek conference venue, a flying saucer-shaped concert and sports hall, as teams continue to haggle over the texts in groups. “This is a start, but far from finished business. Compromise texts are paid for in human lives lost and the poor and vulnerable are calling for so much more,” said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International. Delegates said concerns remained about the rules for implementing Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and whether they can be beefed up to avoid double-counting of emissions and weakening the integrity of environmental markets. A big issue for countries most vulnerable to climate change is a mechanism to find ways to cover the growing costs of “loss and damage”, which has been relegated to a footnote in the draft. Greater clarity is also sought on what countries will do after leaving Poland and how they will strengthen their commitments and targets under the agreement.

2018-12-14,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Around $150 millions’ worth of oil was stolen from Shell’s biggest global refinery over several years, Singapore court documents reviewed by Reuters show, far more than reported when police first revealed the heist earlier this year.  Almost a year on from raids that led to over a dozen arrests, including of several former employees of the local unit of Royal Dutch Shell, charge sheets state that around 340,000 tonnes of gasoil were stolen from the oil major’s Pulau Bukom site in Singapore, in incidents dating back to 2014.  Charges filed in the first few months of investigations after police raids in January related to the theft of around $10 million in oil. Further charges levied in May showed a total of $40 million had been stolen.  A spokeswoman for Shell said the firm is “disappointed”, adding that it has been working with investigators and taken measures to avoid repeat incidents at the Pulau Bukom facility, which lies just south of Singapore’s main island.  “These include closer monitoring of products moving in and out of Bukom, tightening vessel management procedures, and stepping up ethics and compliance training,” the spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters on Thursday.  Southeast Asia is a hot spot for illegal fuel trading, with its island-dotted waters providing cover for small-scale smuggling of oil products across borders. But the regularity and audacity of the thefts at Shell’s refining facility - some of which took place during working hours - stand out.  “Fuel is both ubiquitous and untraceable, making its theft a seemingly low-risk criminal operation compared to something like drug smuggling or arms trafficking, where the concern about being caught is much higher,” said Ian Ralby, a maritime crime expert who works with both the U.N. and the U.S.-based think tank Atlantic Council.  “That false sense of security leads to some fairly brazen forms of theft.”  Fuel theft could be worth $133 billion a year globally, according to industry estimates, although Ralby said that figure might be conservative.  The case in Singapore looks like it could drag on, given the routine addition of new charges and amendments to older charges. The police investigation is still ongoing.  “We are at the stage that the charges are still being rearranged ... it’s quite far from final sentencing,” said Ho Lifen, a lawyer at Rajah & Tann representing one of the accused former Shell employees, Cai Zhi Zhong.  Besides the former Shell employees, there have been related charges filed against former employees of one of Singapore’s biggest marine fuel suppliers, Sentek Marine & Trading Pte Ltd; a Singaporean who worked for Intertek, a British-listed company specializing in quality and quantity assurance, including for fuel products; and three Vietnamese nationals who allegedly received stolen property aboard ships.

2018-12-14,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Stocks worldwide tumbled on Friday after weak economic data from China and Europe fanned concerns of a global economic slowdown and left investors fretting over the wider impact of a still-unresolved Sino-U.S. trade dispute. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks stocks across 47 countries, was down half a percent. Euro zone business ended the year on a weak note, expanding at the slowest pace in over four years as new order growth all but dried up, hurt by trade tensions and violent protests in France, a survey showed. Another survey showed French business activity plunged unexpectedly into contraction this month, retreating at the fastest pace in over four years in the face of violent anti-government protests. Germany’s private sector expansion slowed to a four-year low, meanwhile, suggesting growth in Europe’s largest economy may be weak in the final quarter. The data out of Europe added to weak readings from China, where November retail sales grew at the weakest pace since 2003 and industrial output rose the least in nearly three years, underlining risks to the economy as Beijing works to defuse a trade dispute with the United States. Stock markets in Europe opened sharply lower, with Germany’s DAX index falling 1-1/2 percent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 1.3 percent. “The data this morning out of France really hasn’t helped the mood. You look at China data, you look at the flash PMIs out of France and Germany and they’ve really sort of reinforced concerns that the global economy is slowing down,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. “Ultimately, I think it rather questions the wisdom of the ECB ending its asset purchase programme at the end of this month. You’ve got Mario Draghi basically tightening into a downturn.” MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.5 percent. Japan’s Nikkei, also dragged down by the country’s weak tankan sentiment index, dropped 2.0 percent. China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite and the blue-chip CSI 300 closed down 1.5 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was off 1.5 percent. A Chinese statistics bureau spokesman said the November data showed downward pressure on the economy is increasing. The data “means that the worst is yet to come and policymakers will be very worried, particularly with consumption growth falling off a cliff,” said Sue Trinh, head of Asia FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Hong Kong. “So I expect further support measures including rate cuts will come in coming weeks, although these data would indicate measures to date aren’t really working.” The Chinese yuan weakened 0.4 percent to 6.9063 per dollar in offshore trade following the data. “Although hopes of progress in U.S.-China talks and cheap valuations are supporting the market for now, we have lots of potential pitfalls,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. “If U.S. shares fall below their triple bottoms hit recently, that would be a very weak technical sign.” Overnight on Wall Street, the S&P 500 ticked down 0.02 percent to 2,650, not far from its 6-1/2-month closing low of 2,633 touched on Nov. 23, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.39 percent. U.S. corporate earnings due next month could throw a spotlight on the impact from the U.S. tariffs on imports from China, while there is risk of a government shutdown and further political stalemate in a divided U.S. congress, Kuramochi added. In the currency market, the euro was down 0.7 percent after the weak PMIs, last changing hands at $1.1293. Sterling’s rally fizzled as signs that the British parliament was headed towards a deadlock over Brexit prompted traders to take profits from its gains made after Prime Minister Theresa May had survived a no-confidence vote. The European Union has said the agreed Brexit deal is not open for renegotiation even though its leaders on Thursday gave May assurances that they would seek to agree a new pact with Britain by 2021 so that the contentious Irish “backstop” is never triggered. The pound fell 0.6 percent to $1.2615, on track to post its fifth consecutive week of losses. It was down 0.9 percent so far this week. The dollar stood at 113.48 yen, down 0.1 percent on the day but above this week’s low of 112.245 set on Monday. Oil prices gave up some of their Thursday’s gains following inventory declines in the United States and expectations that the global oil market could have a deficit sooner than they had previously thought. U.S. crude futures edged down 0.5 percent to $52.32 per barrel and Brent crude slipped 0.6 percent to $61.09, after both gained more than 2.5 percent on Thursday. Cryptocurrency Bitcoin fell as low as $3,200, a fresh 15-month low. A rash of bomb threats were emailed on Thursday to hundreds of businesses, public offices and schools across the United States and Canada demanding payment in cryptocurrency, but none of the threats appeared credible, law enforcement officials said.

2018-12-14,"* Chinese data stokes worries over oil demand outlook * OPEC-led deal to cut supply supports crude prices * IEA expects deficit in oil supply by Q2 next year (Updates throughout, changes dateline, previous SINGAPORE) By Christopher Johnson LONDON, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped on Friday after China reported slower economic growth, pointing to lower fuel demand in the world’s biggest oil importer, although market sentiment was supported by supply cuts agreed last week by major crude producers. Benchmark Brent crude was down 40 cents at $61.05 per barrel by 0820 GMT, on course for a decline this week of around 1 percent. U.S. light crude was 25 cents lower at $52.33. China, the world’s No.2 economy, on Friday reported some of its slowest growth in retail sales and industrial output in years, highlighting the risks of the country’s trade dispute with the United States. Chinese oil refinery throughput in November fell from October, suggesting an easing in oil demand, though runs were 2.9 percent above levels a year earlier. Concerned by mounting oversupply, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers including Russia agreed last week to reduce output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), or more than 1 percent of global demand. “For the time being until the OPEC cuts start kicking in, the market is oversupplied in the short term,” said Tony Nunan, oil risk manager at Mitsubishi Corp. “If China is slowing down, that’s definitely a concern.” The International Energy Agency said on Thursday that it expected a deficit in oil supply to emerge by the second quarter of next year, provided OPEC members and other key producers stuck closely to last week’s deal to cut output. “The OPEC cuts will have a substantial impact on 1Q19 balances compared with this quarter, but market observers may need to wait for the cuts to percolate to inventory data,” Barclays analyst Michael Cohen said in a note. As part of the agreement, de facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia plans to reduce its output to 10.2 million bpd in January. The IEA kept its 2019 forecast for global oil demand growth at 1.4 million bpd, unchanged from its projection last month, and said it expected growth of 1.3 million bpd this year. “Our market balance looks 0.5 million bpd tighter next year on reduced OPEC supply, such that the surplus is just 0.2 million bpd,” Cohen said.

2018-12-14,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Coal railway workers at Australian hauler Aurizon Holdings Ltd have postponed some planned strikes in Queensland, a union official said, as a cyclone is forecast to bring poor weather near some of the affected railways.  Aurizon’s four major railways in the Bowen Basin of Queensland, the world’s largest coking coal export region, carry coal from mines owned by BHP Billiton, Glencore, Anglo American and Peabody Energy to ports on the country’s east coast. Bruce Mackie, the Queensland president of the Rail, Tram and Bus Union, which represents train crews and maintenance workers at Aurizon, said by phone that planned stoppages on Friday went ahead but that some other strikes were deferred by seven days. “We are delaying in the best interests of our members,” he said, citing their safety given the storm forecast. Cyclone Owen, a category three storm in the Gulf of Carpentaria, is predicted to hit Queensland’s far north over the weekend. Poor weather has already prompted the Abbot Point Coal Terminal to halt unloading at midnight (1400 GMT) on Friday, Aurizon said, so the hauler has canceled trains on its Newlands line, which runs to the port, until further notice. The strikes at Aurizon had been called after a breakdown in negotiations over pay and rostering. Aurizon, which had previously called the strikes disappointing and unnecessary, said in a statement its rail services will now keep going on its Goonyella corridor, though strikes there and on its Newlands line are now planned for Dec. 22. A BHP spokesman said on Thursday the strikes would have no “material impact” and had no further comment on Friday. A Glencore spokesman said the company had no comment. Peabody had no immediate comment and Anglo American did not immediately reply to an email sent after business hours. Aurizon shares closed flat on Friday while the broader market dropped by a percentage point.

2018-12-14,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) snapped a three-week losing streak to end higher this week, with the onset of winter expected to boost demand for natural gas for heating. But gains were limited amid forecasts of warmer-than-usual temperatures for most of next week in Tokyo, Beijing and Seoul, the top demand centers for natural gas in Asia, and as more spot supply entered the market from the United States and Russia.    Spot prices for January delivery edged up about 10 cents to around $8.90 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), with cargoes trading from as low as $8.50 per mmBtu to as high as $9.10 per mmBtu, several industry sources said. Prices for February delivery also inched higher and were estimated at around $9.10 to $9.30 per mmBtu, keeping the price curve in contango.  “The (spot) market has probably bottomed out with (prices) being pretty flat and I am hearing of more people looking for cargoes,” said a Singapore-based LNG trader.  China, the world’s No. 2 LNG importer, has ramped up both domestic gas production and imports to meet rising demand as the government switches more households to gas heating this winter.  China’s November natural gas output climbed 10 percent to a record-high of 14.3 billion cubic meters (bcm), official data showed on Friday.  It has switched another 3.29 million households to gas heating this winter, Reuters calculations show, more than it added last year. But analysts said the increase would not necessarily boost overall consumption in the country. “Till now, China’s demand is increasing, but it has not affected the inventory too much,” a trader familiar with the Chinese market said. With forecasts of a warmer-than-usual week next week, LNG buyers in China are taking a wait-and-see approach before deciding to ramp up imports of the super-chilled fuel, he said.  Taiwan’s CPC Corp entered the spot market to seek a cargo for delivery in January, while South Korea’s state-run Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) is looking for long-term supply starting from 2025, traders said. On the supply side, Cheniere Energy (LNG.A) loaded the commissioning cargo of LNG from its Corpus Christi liquefaction facility in Texas, the third big LNG export terminal to enter service in the lower 48 U.S. states.  Greece this week said it would import its first U.S. LNG cargο of 150,000 cubic meters on Dec. 29 from Cheniere. Russia’s Yamal LNG has started up train 3 at its plant, 12 months ahead of schedule, with the plant reaching full capacity of 16.5 million tonnes a year.

2018-12-14,"* Asian shares extend losses after disappointing Chinese data * Worries about U.S.-China collision also keep investors on edge * Euro steady a day after ECB ends QE but keeps reinvestments * Spread-betters see European markets opening lower By Hideyuki Sano and Tomo Uetake TOKYO, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Asian shares tumbled on Friday after China reported a set of weak data, fanning fresh worries of a slowdown in the world’s second-biggest economy and leaving investors fretting over the wider impact of a yet unresolved Sino-U.S. trade dispute. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.3 percent. Japan’s Nikkei, also dragged down by the country’s weak tankan sentiment index, dropped 2.0 percent. China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite and the blue-chip CSI 300 closed down 1.5 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was off 1.5 percent. Financial spread-betters expect London’s FTSE Frankfurt’s DAX and Paris’s CAC to fall between 0.7 and 0.8 percent when they open. China’s November retail sales grew at the weakest pace since 2003 and industrial output rose the least in nearly three years as domestic demand softened further, underlining rising risks to the economy as Beijing works to defuse a trade dispute with the United States. A Chinese statistics bureau spokesman said the November data showed downward pressure on the economy is increasing. The data “means that the worst is yet to come and policymakers will be very worried, particularly with consumption growth falling off a cliff,” said Sue Trinh, head of Asia FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Hong Kong. “So I expect further support measures including rate cuts will come in coming weeks, although these data would indicate measures to date aren’t really working.” The Chinese yuan weakened 0.15 percent to 6.8888 per dollar in offshore trade following the data. “Although hopes of progress in U.S.-China talks and cheap valuations are supporting the market for now, we have lots of potential pitfalls,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. “If U.S. shares fall below their triple bottoms hit recently, that would be a very weak technical sign.” Overnight on Wall Street, the S&P 500 ticked down 0.02 percent to 2,650, not far from its 6-1/2-month closing low of 2,633 touched on Nov. 23, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.39 percent. U.S. corporate earnings due next month could throw a spotlight on the impact from the U.S. tariffs on imports from China, while there is risk of a government shutdown and further political stalemate in a divided U.S. congress, Kuramochi added. In the currency market, the euro stuck in its well-worn $1.13-$1.14 range over the past few days, a day after the European Central Bank ended its 2.6 trillion euro bond purchase scheme but pledged to continue reinvesting maturing bonds -thereby avoiding shrinking its balance sheet- for an extended period of time. The common currency last changed hands at $1.1352. “With Thursday’s decision, the ECB is only taking very lightly the foot off the accelerator of monetary policy, which is by no means a real normalisation of monetary policy,” said Oliver Eichmann, co-head of EMEA fixed income at DWS in Frankfurt. Sterling’s rally fizzled as signs that the British parliament was headed towards a deadlock over Brexit prompted traders to take profits from its gains made after Prime Minister Theresa May had survived a no-confidence vote. The European Union has said the agreed Brexit deal is not open for renegotiation even though its leaders on Thursday gave May assurances that they would seek to agree a new pact with Britain by 2021 so that the contentious Irish “backstop” is never triggered. The pound fell 0.4 percent to $1.2615, on track to post its fifth consecutive week of losses. It was down 0.9 percent so far this week. The dollar stood at 113.57 yen, flat on the day but above this week’s low of 112.245 set on Monday. The kiwi fell as much as 1.0 percent to $0.6861 after the central bank said it was considering almost doubling the required capital banks would need to hold to bolster the financial system’s capacity to handle any shocks. Oil prices gave up some of their Thursday’s gains following inventory declines in the United States and expectations that the global oil market could have a deficit sooner than they had previously thought. U.S. crude futures edged down 0.6 percent to $52.27 per barrel and Brent crude slipped 0.8 percent to $60.94, after both gained more than 2.5 percent on Thursday. Cryptocurrency Bitcoin fell as low as $3,200, a fresh 15-month low. A rash of bomb threats were emailed on Thursday to hundreds of businesses, public offices and schools across the United States and Canada demanding payment in cryptocurrency, but none of the threats appeared credible, law enforcement officials said.

2018-12-14,"* Refiners scale back runs from Sept, Oct as prices fall * Throughput headed for annual record as refinery starts up * Natural gas output at record as heating season starts * China expected to consume 270 bcm of gas in 2018 (Adds background of Hengli refinery starting test runs, export quotas being issued) By Meng Meng and Chen Aizhu BEIJING/SINGAPORE, Dec 14 (Reuters) - China’s November refinery throughput rose from a year earlier, heading for an annual record, official data indicated on Friday, although the runs eased from highs touched in the previous two months as product inventories swelled and sales slowed. Refineries in November processed 50.46 million tonnes of crude oil, or 12.28 million barrels per day, up 2.9 percent from the same month last year, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the National Bureau of Statistics. The daily crude processing rates, however, came off 12.43 million bpd in October and a record of 12.49 million bpd in September, the statistics data showed. The fall from the September-October peaks came as the government lowered prices for gasoline and diesel in November to track a steep drop in global crude prices, and to counter a sharp slowdown in local sales that started in mid-October. “China’s state planner lowered gasoline and diesel prices three times in November. Both teapots and state refiners were under pressure to sell products to meet their annual sales target,” said Han Cong, products analyst with consultancy JLC. She added that private refiners’ utilisation rates fell to 63.22 percent in the first week of December from 65.71 percent at the start of November, further indication of the pressure plants are under to scale back operations amid slowing sales. Still, for the first 11 months, refinery output gained 7.2 percent to 554.48 million tonnes, or 12.12 million bpd, on track for an annual record. The slowing domestic products sales have also prompted state refiners to seek additional fuel export quotas to release some of the glut. Crude throughput is still expected to increase over last year levels in December as a new refinery starts up. China’s private refiner Hengli Petrochemical said on Wednesday it plans test operations at its 400,000-bpd refinery in Dalian on Dec. 15, which is likely to be reflected more fully in the country’s refinery output in January. China’s November natural gas production rose 10 percent to a record of 14.3 billion cubic meters (bcm), the data showed, to cope with heating demand that typically starts every year from around mid-November. China ramped up both domestic output and imports to meet rising demand from households as the government switched another 3 million households to gas heating this winter. For January-November, gas output was up 6.6 percent from a year ago at 143.8 bcm. China is expected to consume 270 bcm of gas this year, the chairwoman of Beijing Gas, the dominant gas distributor in China’s capital, said on Thursday. That represents a rise of 12.5 percent, in line with an earlier estimate by consultancy SIA Energy. China’s crude oil output in November fell 1.3 percent from the same month last year, and was down 1.6 percent versus a year earlier for the first 11 months, the data showed. 1 tonne of crude = 7.3 barrels

2018-12-14,"* China produced 2.82 mln T of aluminium last month * Up around 4 pct from Oct, 19 pct from Nov last year * That came despite weakness in aluminium prices * Analysts had expected fourth straight monthly drop (Recasts, adds analyst comment) By Tom Daly BEIJING, Dec 14 (Reuters) - China’s primary aluminium output rebounded in November after three straight months of decline, defying a fall in prices for the metal used in everything from construction to making cars. Analysts were surprised by the climb, which came as smelters apparently ramped up output ahead of winter production curbs that kicked in around the middle of the month. The world’s top aluminium maker produced 2.82 million tonnes of the material last month, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Friday. That was up 3.9 percent from 2.72 million tonnes in October and up 19.2 percent from November 2017, the bureau said. On a daily basis, China produced 94,000 tonnes of aluminium last month, versus around 88,000 tonnes in October, according to Reuters calculations. That was the highest daily rate since July, when the monthly total of 2.93 million tonnes matched the all-time high. November has one less day than October. Shanghai aluminium prices fell by 2.8 percent over November and hit two-year lows, leaving smelters struggling to turn a profit in a well-supplied market. “New capacity increases (probably) outpaced the capacity closures,” said Helen Lau, an analyst at Argonaut Securities in Hong Kong. Lower prices for raw materials bauxite and alumina may also have been a factor, she added. “The cost pressure is lower and that also helps (smelters) to increase production.” Paul Adkins, managing director of AZ China, said his consultancy’s own output numbers for November showed a 1.6-percent drop from October amid capacity closures. State-run Aluminum Corp of China Ltd , known as Chalco, said on Nov. 30 that it was cutting 470,000 tonnes of annual capacity due to market conditions and environmental protection requirements. China is waging a self-styled ‘war on pollution’ after years of breakneck economic growth. Top producer China Hongqiao Group has been ordered to close up to 550,000 tonnes of annual smelting capacity for the winter heating season that started in mid-November, according to analyst calculations. Over the first 11 months of 2018, China produced 31.45 million tonnes of aluminium, up 7.5 percent year-on-year and on course for record annual output, the NBS data showed. Meanwhile, output of 10 nonferrous metals - including copper, aluminium, lead, zinc and nickel - came in at 4.71 million tonnes in November, up 4.2 percent from October and up 12.7 percent year-on-year. On a daily basis, production came to 157,000 tonnes, the highest since June 2017. January-November output was up 6.1 percent at 50.43 million tonnes. The other metals in the group are tin, antimony, mercury, magnesium and titanium.

A Chinese commerce ministry spokesman said on Thursday China and the United States are in close contact over trade and that any U.S. trade delegation would be welcome to visit. But that has hardly dispelled concerns about a broadening confrontation between the two economic heavyweights. China said on Thursday a Canadian businessman is being investigated on suspicion of harming China’s security, days after a former Canadian diplomat was detained in an escalating diplomatic row. The moves are seen as a reaction to Canada’s arrest on Dec. 1 of Chinese executive Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies, for extradition to the United States. . The euro changed hands at $1.1362, stuck in its well-worn $1.13-$1.14 range over the past few days. The European Central Bank ended its 2.6 trillion euro crisis-fighting bond purchase scheme but pledged to continue reinvesting maturing bonds - thereby avoiding shrinking its balance sheet - for an extended period of time.

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 ticked down 0.02 percent to 2,650, not far from its 6-1/2-month closing low of 2,633 touched on Nov 23, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.39 percent. “If U.S. shares fall below their triple bottoms hit recently, that would be a very weak technical sign,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. U.S. corporate earnings due next month could throw a spotlight on the impact from the U.S. tariffs on imports from China, while there is risk of a government shutdown and further political stalemate in a divided U.S. congress, he said. “Although hopes of progress in U.S.-China talks and cheap valuations are supporting the market for now, we have lots of potential pitfalls,” Kuramochi added. A Chinese commerce ministry spokesman said on Thursday China and the United States are in close contact over trade and that any U.S. trade delegation would be welcome to visit. But that has hardly dispelled concerns about a broadening confrontation between the two economic heavyweights. China said on Thursday a Canadian businessman is being investigated on suspicion of harming China’s security, days after a former Canadian diplomat was detained in an escalating diplomatic row. The moves are seen as a reaction to Canada’s arrest on Dec. 1 of Chinese executive Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies, for extradition to the United States. . The euro changed hands at $1.1362, stuck in its well-worn $1.13-$1.14 range over the past few days. The ECB ended its 2.6 trillion euro crisis-fighting bond purchase scheme but pledged to continue reinvesting maturing bonds - thereby avoiding shrinking its balance sheet - for an extended period of time. The plan lifted Portuguese and Irish government bond prices sharply on Thursday. Sterling’s rally fizzled as signs that the British parliament was headed towards a deadlock over Brexit prompted traders to take profits from its gains made after Prime Minister Theresa May had survived a no-confidence vote. May admitted on Thursday she did not expect a quick breakthrough in Brexit talks that would help get the deal through parliament. The European Union has said the agreed Brexit deal is not open for renegotiation even though its leaders on Thursday gave May assurances that they would seek to agree a new pact with Britain by 2021 so that the contentious Irish “backstop” is never triggered. The currency traded at $1.2655, off Wednesday’s low of $1.2477, but remains on track to post its fourth consecutive week of losses, with a fall of 0.6 percent so far this week. The dollar stood at 113.60 yen, flat on the day but having risen from this week’s low of 112.245 set on Monday. Oil prices held firm after data showed on Thursday inventory declines in the United States and as investors began to expect that the global oil market could have a deficit sooner than they had previously thought. The International Energy Agency said in its monthly report that OPEC’s output agreement with Russia and Canada’s decision to mandate production cuts could create an oil market supply deficit by the second quarter of next year. Both Brent crude and U.S. light crude gained more than 2.5 percent on Thursday. U.S. crude last traded at $52.77 per barrel, up 19 cents or 0.35 percent.

2018-12-14,"LONDON (Reuters) - British shale gas company Cuadrilla has paused fracking at its Preston New Road site in Lancashire, northwest England, for the fourth time since October following a minor seismic event, it said on Friday. The company has had to repeatedly stop operations at the site since they began two months ago under Britain’s traffic light regulation system, which immediately suspends work if seismic activity of magnitude 0.5 or above is detected. “Cuadrilla has paused and will continue to monitor micro seismicity for at least 18 hours after the event was recorded,” the company said in a statement, adding that well integrity “has been checked and verified”. Fracking, or hydraulically fracturing, involves extracting gas from rocks by breaking them up with water and chemicals at high pressure.

The government however is keen to cut the country’s reliance on imports of natural gas, which is used to heat around 80 percent of Britain’s homes. Cuadrilla is 47.4 percent owned by Australia’s AJ Lucas, while a fund managed by Riverstone holds a 45.2 percent stake. Cuadrilla said last month it had extracted its first shale gas from the site.

2018-12-14,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Around $150 millions’ worth of oil was stolen from Shell’s biggest global refinery over several years, Singapore court documents reviewed by Reuters show, far more than reported when police first revealed the heist earlier this year.  Almost a year on from raids that led to over a dozen arrests, including of several former employees of the local unit of Royal Dutch Shell, charge sheets state that around 340,000 tonnes of gasoil were stolen from the oil major’s Pulau Bukom site in Singapore, in incidents dating back to 2014.  Charges filed in the first few months of investigations after police raids in January related to the theft of around $10 million in oil. Further charges levied in May showed a total of $40 million had been stolen.  A spokeswoman for Shell said the firm is “disappointed”, adding that it has been working with investigators and taken measures to avoid repeat incidents at the Pulau Bukom facility, which lies just south of Singapore’s main island.  “These include closer monitoring of products moving in and out of Bukom, tightening vessel management procedures, and stepping up ethics and compliance training,” the spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters on Thursday.  Southeast Asia is a hot spot for illegal fuel trading, with its island-dotted waters providing cover for small-scale smuggling of oil products across borders. But the regularity and audacity of the thefts at Shell’s refining facility - some of which took place during working hours - stand out.  “Fuel is both ubiquitous and untraceable, making its theft a seemingly low-risk criminal operation compared to something like drug smuggling or arms trafficking, where the concern about being caught is much higher,” said Ian Ralby, a maritime crime expert who works with both the U.N. and the U.S.-based think tank Atlantic Council.  “That false sense of security leads to some fairly brazen forms of theft.”  Fuel theft could be worth $133 billion a year globally, according to industry estimates, although Ralby said that figure might be conservative.  The case in Singapore looks like it could drag on, given the routine addition of new charges and amendments to older charges. The police investigation is still ongoing.  Ho Lifen, a lawyer at Rajah & Tann representing one of the accused former Shell employees, Cai Zhi Zhong, said the charges were being amalgamated. “It’s quite far from final sentencing,” she said. Besides the former Shell employees, there have been related charges filed against former employees of one of Singapore’s biggest marine fuel suppliers, Sentek Marine & Trading Pte Ltd; a Singaporean who worked for Intertek, a British-listed company specializing in quality and quantity assurance, including for fuel products; and three Vietnamese nationals who allegedly received stolen property aboard ships.

2018-12-14,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Lone Star Ports LLC will lead development and operation of a Carlyle Group-backed crude export terminal in Corpus Christi, Texas, that can fully load supertankers, according to a statement from the project leaders on Friday. Carlyle Group (CG.O) and the Port of Corpus Christi Authority in October jointly proposed building a $1 billion crude export terminal on an island controlled by the authority. The partners have said they expect to begin operations at the facility in late 2020. Thursday’s announcement adds a project manager to oversee development and construction of the facility, one of three competing to be the first to begin operations in the area.  There are more than six proposed terminal projects along the Texas and Louisiana coasts angling to handle exports of U.S. oil, with booming production expected to reach more than 12 million barrels per day (bpd) next year.       Corpus Christi’s three projects would be the closest to the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin shale fields. New crude pipelines that will ferry an additional 2 million bpd to the South Texas port are expected to begin operations late next year. Lone Star, a recently formed joint venture between Carlyle and construction company The Berry Group, reached preliminary agreements to connect the proposed terminal to crude pipelines owned by Hilcorp Energy Co’s [HILCO.UL] Harvest Midstream and to Epic Pipeline LP. The two pipelines will have access to more than 1 million bpd of crude oil production, the companies said in a statement.  Lone Star is led by former EQT Corp (EQT.N) midstream executive Jeremiah Ashcroft III, who has previously led development of other marine terminals. Lone Star also disclosed a deal with services provider Martin Midstream Partners LP (MMLP.O) to work together on the Corpus Christi project.  When completed, the Carlyle-Port of Corpus Christi terminal will have the capacity to store 4 million barrels onshore and load 1.4 million bpd onto tankers. Carlyle earlier agreed to help finance dredging of the waters near the export terminal to reach a depth of 75 feet, which would allow supertankers that carry up to 2 million barrels of crude to fully load at its docks.

2018-12-14,"* Libya’s biggest oilfield halted since seize began last Sat * Ransom payment would set dangerous precedent -NOC * NOC declared force majeure on exports on Monday * NOC has evacuated some staff -engineers (Adds El-Feel working normally) By Ayman al-Warfalli BENGHAZI, Libya, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Libya’s state-owned National Oil Corp. (NOC) said it was against paying a ransom to an armed group that has halted crude production at the country’s largest oilfield. “Any attempt to pay a ransom to the armed militia which shut down El Sharara (oilfield) would set a dangerous precedent that would threaten the recovery of the Libyan economy,” NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in a statement on the company’s website. NOC on Monday declared force majeure on exports from the 315,000-barrels-per-day oilfield after it was seized at the weekend by a local militia group. The nearby El-Feel oilfield, which uses the same power supply as El Sharara, was still producing normally, a spokesman for NOC said, without giving an output figure. The field usually pumps around 70,000 bpd. Since 2013 Libya has faced a wave of blockages of oilfields and export terminals by armed groups and civilians trying to press the country’s weak state into concessions. Officials have tended to end such action by paying off protesters who demand to be added to the public payroll. At El Sharara, in southern Libya, a mix of state-paid guards, civilians and tribesmen have occupied the field, camping there since Saturday, protesters and oil workers said. The protesters work in shifts, with some going home at night. NOC has evacuated some staff by plane, engineers at the oilfield said. A number of sub-stations away from the main field have been vacated and equipment removed. The occupiers are divided, with members of the Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) indicating they would end the blockade in return for a quick cash payment, oil workers say. The PFG has demanded more men be added to the public payroll. The tribesmen have asked for long-term development funds, which might take time. Libya is run by two competing, weak governments. Armed groups, tribesmen and normal Libyans tend to vent their anger about high inflation and a lack of infrastructure on the NOC, which they see as a cash cow booking billions of dollars in oil and gas revenues annually.

2018-12-14,"(Adds Darmstadt) Dec 14 (Reuters) - German cities are starting to introduce bans on older diesel vehicles that emit higher amounts of pollutants than later models after the country’s highest administrative court in February confirmed such bans are permissible. Germany’s cities have for years flouted Europe’s clean air rules, prompting environmental groups to sue local governments in an attempt to force bans of some heavily polluting vehicles. The first diesel ban took effect in May in Hamburg. Diesel car sales in Germany fell to 31.1 percent of the total in the first half of 2018 from 41.3 percent a year earlier, while in the European Union sales declined by 16 percent during the period. After a court ruling on Nov. 15, imposing diesel driving bans in certain areas of the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, the state of Hesse announced that Darmstadt would ban some older diesel and petrol cars from parts of the city. Wiesbaden is expected to be the next German city to decide on a ban, with a ruling expected on Dec. 19. Below is a summary of the rulings on diesel vehicles in various cities so far: The state of Hesse plans to ban older diesel cars with engines conforming to the Euro 5 emissions standard, as well as petrol vehicles up to Euro 2 from two streets in the city. The plan to reduce pollution is to take effect from mid-2019. A court ruled that the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia must ban older diesel vehicles from parts of the nation’s industrial heartland, including a busy motorway as well as the city centre of Essen and some areas of Gelsenkirchen. A court ruled that Cologne must introduce bans on older diesel vehicles in certain areas from April 2019. The nearby city of Bonn must impose bans for two roads. A court ruled that Mainz, the state capital of Rhineland-Palatinate, must impose a driving ban on older diesel vehicles in September 2019, if nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter pollution levels are not brought down to agreed limits. The city can appeal against the ruling. The state of Baden-Wuerttemberg plans to ban older diesel cars with engines conforming to the Euro 4 emissions standard, which stems from 2005, in Stuttgart in 2019. A ban on diesel cars adhering to the Euro 5 emissions standard, which applied to vehicles made from 2009, is still before the court. A local administrative court in June said driving bans would be imposed unless values for nitrogen oxide pollution were met by the end of year. From February 2019 diesel cars made to Euro 4 standard and older will be prohibited from entering the city centre, the administrative court in Wiesbaden ruled in September. The air pollution control plan, to be updated by the state of Hesse, must also include a driving ban for diesel vehicles of the Euro 5 standard from September 2019. In October, the administrative court ruled that by the end of June 2019, cars and trucks with diesel engines that comply only with the Euro 5 or lower emission standard, should not be allowed to drive on at least eleven routes. In Munich, city authorities have not implemented a court ruling from February 2017, to ban some diesel vehicles on certain routes, despite facing fines for their failure to do so. In Duesseldorf a court ordered, as early as 2016, that a driving ban for diesel vehicles should be seriously examined. Despite that, in August 2018 the district government of the city presented a new air pollution control plan without driving bans. Germany’s first diesel ban took effect in Hamburg in May.

2018-12-14,"GUWAHATI, India (Reuters) - Rescue workers were trying on Friday to reach 13 miners trapped underground in a coal mine in India’s remote northeastern Meghalaya state since the previous day, authorities said. The mine is an old, illegal so-called rat-hole mine, they said. Rat-hole mines are common in Meghalaya as they are dug by villagers but are very dangerous as the coal is pulled out from narrow, horizontal seams. Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma said authorities had no information on the condition of the miners. “We are praying that they come out alive,” he told Reuters by telephone from the state capital Shillong. A flash flood from a nearby river on Thursday raced through the mine, which is located near a dense forest, said Sylvester Nongtngr, police chief of the East Jaintia Hills district of Meghalaya. Nearly all mines in Meghalaya, which borders Bangladesh, use the rat-hole mining method, even though they are not legal and authorities try to crack down on them.  Workers, often children, descend hundreds of feet on bamboo ladders to dig out the coal from small holes, often leading to accidents.

The plant has a capacity of 100,000 barrels per day (bpd). INA also owns a smaller refinery with a capacity of 60,000 bpd located in the central town of Sisak. While a modernisation of the Rijeka refinery is tentatively planned, the future of the Sisak refinery is uncertain and it may eventually be converted into a logistics centre or some other facility. In a recent interview with the local Jutarnji List daily, INA’s Chief Executive Sandor Fasimon said the combined capacity of the refineries was 6.7 million tons a year, while currently the market demand is around 4.0 million tons. INA is owned by MOL, which has a stake of 49.1 percent, and the Croatian government with 44.8 percent. The remaining stock is controlled by private and institutional investors. The two big shareholders have been at odds for years over management rights and investment policy. Zagreb has said it wants to buy back INA shares from MOL, but a price has yet to be negotiated.

2018-12-14,"Dec 14 (Reuters) - Global credit rating agency Fitch downgraded Pakistan’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to ‘B-‘ from ‘B’, citing a rise in external financing risk from low reserves and high external debt repayments, along with a continued deterioration in the economy’s fiscal position. Pakistan’s rating outlook is stable, Fitch Ratings said on Friday. Inflation in the country has risen due to a significant rupee depreciation and higher energy prices, Fitch noted. Last month, Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund failed to agree on a bailout package during a visit by an IMF delegation. Pakistani officials had set mid-January as the target date for the IMF to sign off on the country’s second bailout since 2013, when Islamabad was loaned $6.7 billion. The rating agency said successful talks on IMF support could help in stabilising Pakistan’s external finances but added that the programme will face a significant implementation risk. Finance minister Asad Umar had said in October that Pakistan would seek an IMF funding package, its 13th since the late 1980s. In the same month, Pakistan also announced that Saudi Arabia had offered $3 billion in foreign currency support to the country’s central bank and a further loan worth $3 billion in deferred payments for oil. Fitch said financial commitments given to the country by Saudi Arabia, China and the United Arab Emirates have helped the economy plug its near-term financing gap. However, it also remarked that Pakistan’s tensions with neighbouring countries pose a geopolitical risk.

2018-12-14,"OSLO (Reuters) - The Norwegian government has postponed a decision on whether to mandate the construction of an oil processing terminal near the Arctic tip of northern Europe until the third quarter of next year, it said on Friday. If built, the onshore Veidnes terminal would receive crude via a pipeline from Equinor’s (EQNR.OL) offshore Johan Castberg oilfield, which is expected to start producing in late 2022. Equinor originally ditched plans for an onshore terminal in order to save costs, preferring instead to load oil on to crude tankers at the field before exporting it to global markets. Parliament earlier this year urged the government to secure the construction of an onshore terminal, however, as it would generate significant investment and jobs in the remote region. The energy ministry said on Friday further studies were needed into the project, which is supported by labour unions. Environmentalists, however, oppose both the oilfield and the proposed terminal.

2018-12-14,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Climate change talks billed as the most important U.N. conference since the 2015 Paris global warming deal are in their last week in Katowice, capital of Poland’s coal mining district. Below is a look at the mood round the event, in a sprawl of temporary passageways and rooms next to the Spodek, a flying-saucer-shaped venue on the site of the former Katowice coal mine.  Officially the last day of the climate conference in the Polish city of Katowice. Ministers and negotiators are haggling over final details of the deal after the Polish presidency of the talks released drafts of the various components late on Thursday night and early on Friday. Ministers are expected  to gather for a plenary from 1500 GMT to try and work through the final details. “It will continue through the day and may last into the night,” a South American delegate said.       Although some delegates said progress has been made on various issues, some concerns remain around climate change finance for developing countries, transparency in reporting emissions from major polluters and details around increasing ambitions by 2020 to curb national emissions. “I think, we will make it in the end,” another delegate said, “Not everyone is satisfied yet. The president of the COP will hold bilateral in coming hours.” As always at U.N. climate conferences, delegates, journalists and activists are betting on how far into the night the negotiations will go and when the gravel will come down on the talks. Optimists see the conference ending in the early hours of Saturday. Pessimists see the talks dragging on until Sunday. After two weeks of marathon talks, the last two nights have seen some delegates work through the night, with fatigue already taking a toll on flagging delegates. Over a hundred activists from different countries staged another protests at the Katowice conference centre to protest what the said was a corporate takeover of the climate talks. The protesters held banners which read: “Which side are you on?” and “Stand with the people, not the pollutters,” as conference delegates and negotiators walk by. “Countries are failing to advance real solutions at UN climate talks, so the Global Campaign to Demand Climate Justice and grassroots leaders from around the world are convening on the final Friday of COP24 to hold a sit-in, demand climate justice, and ask people and countries, “which side are you on?”, a statement said.

2018-12-14,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Stocks worldwide tumbled on Friday after weak economic data from China and Europe fanned concerns of a global economic slowdown and left investors fretting over the wider impact of a still-unresolved Sino-U.S. trade dispute. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks stocks across 47 countries, was down over half a percent by afternoon in Europe. Futures indicated a weak open on Wall Street. Euro zone business ended the year on a weak note, expanding at the slowest pace in over four years as new order growth all but dried up, hurt by trade tensions and violent protests in France, a survey showed. Another survey showed French business activity plunged unexpectedly into contraction this month, retreating at the fastest pace in over four years in the face of violent anti-government protests. Germany’s private sector expansion slowed to a four-year low, meanwhile, suggesting growth in Europe’s largest economy may be weak in the final quarter. The data out of Europe added to weak readings from China, where November retail sales grew at the weakest pace since 2003 and industrial output rose the least in nearly three years, underlining risks to the economy as Beijing works to defuse a trade dispute with the United States. Stock markets in Europe fell sharply, with Germany’s DAX index falling by as much as 1-1/2 percent. It was last down 0.8 percent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was last down 0.8 percent, after falling over 1 percent earlier. “The data this morning out of France really hasn’t helped the mood. You look at China data, you look at the flash PMIs out of France and Germany and they’ve really sort of reinforced concerns that the global economy is slowing down,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. “Ultimately, I think it rather questions the wisdom of the ECB ending its asset purchase programme at the end of this month. You’ve got Mario Draghi basically tightening into a downturn.” MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.5 percent. Japan’s Nikkei, also dragged down by the country’s weak tankan sentiment index, dropped 2.0 percent. China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite and the blue-chip CSI 300 closed down 1.5 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was off 1.5 percent. A Chinese statistics bureau spokesman said the November data showed downward pressure on the economy is increasing. “The market’s softer after Chinese retail sales. They’re still quite stellar growth, they were lower than expected and enough to concern the market,” said Edward Park, investment director at Brooks Macdonald. The Chinese yuan weakened 0.4 percent to 6.9020 per dollar in offshore trade following the data. Overnight on Wall Street, the S&P 500 ticked down 0.02 percent to 2,650, not far from its 6-1/2-month closing low of 2,633 touched on Nov. 23, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.39 percent. U.S. corporate earnings due next month could throw a spotlight on the impact from the U.S. tariffs on imports from China, while there is risk of a government shutdown and further political stalemate in a divided U.S. congress, Kuramochi added. In the currency market, the euro was down 0.7 percent after the weak PMIs, last changing hands at $1.1293. Sterling fell more than half a percent to below $1.26 after Prime Minister Theresa May returned from a visit to Brussels, where she failed to win assurances from European Union leaders over her Brexit withdrawal agreement. The European Union has said the agreed Brexit deal is not open for renegotiation even though its leaders on Thursday gave May assurances that they would seek to agree a new pact with Britain by 2021 so that the contentious Irish “backstop” is never triggered. The dollar stood at 113.61 yen, down 0.1 percent on the day but above this week’s low of 112.245 set on Monday. Oil prices fell after China reported slower economic growth, pointing to lower fuel demand in the world’s biggest oil importer, although market sentiment was supported by supply cuts agreed last week by major crude producers. U.S. crude futures fell 0.7 percent to $52.22 per barrel and Brent crude slid 0.8 percent to $60.94, after both gained more than 2.5 percent on Thursday. Cryptocurrency Bitcoin fell as low as $3,200, a fresh 15-month low. A rash of bomb threats were emailed on Thursday to hundreds of businesses, public offices and schools across the United States and Canada demanding payment in cryptocurrency, but none of the threats appeared credible, law enforcement officials said.

2018-12-14,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Delegates at U.N. climate talks in the Polish city of Katowice point to the mining museum next to the conference venue as the proper place for coal, which provides 80 percent of the country’s electricity. Poland’s decision to host the negotiations to revive the 2015 Paris agreement on phasing out fossil fuel has laid bare the tension between high-minded goals and business realities. A short drive from the conference venue, at the Silesian region’s dozen or so remaining mines, tonnes of freshly dug coal thunder down shoots to be rail-roaded to power plants for carbon-intensive generation.    Coal bosses see a need to address climate risk, but say Poland must use thermal coal for electricity until it has a better option.     Silesia also produces coking coal, used in steel, and viewed as a strategic mineral even by the European Union, which seeks to be an environmental leader. Poland’s JSW, the European Union’s largest coking coal producer, is seeking to grow.  “The world has to tackle the increase of carbon dioxide emissions, but I do not see a chance the world can live without steel these days and there is not an easy solution to substitute steel and substitute coking coal,” CEO Daniel Ozon told Reuters. Financial backing can be an issue for all forms of coal and JSW has its eye on Chinese banks as international lenders are wary. For many Poles, coal mining symbolizes national independence.  State-dominated companies can look to a government striving to win over an electorate divided between an older generation that associates coal with a reliable income and a sense of community, and youths engaged in climate protests. As the demonstrators march, international business works to keep shareholders on side. One of the climate team from the world’s biggest producer of coking coal BHP was among business representatives taking part in the side events accompanying the negotiations. The U.N. talks have proved long and fractious, with flash-points including a revolt by Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United States and Kuwait against a major scientific report that laid out the reasons to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. “The real challenge is not whether it’s 2 degrees or 1.5 degrees; it’s that not enough is happening,” Graham Winkelman, BHP’s practice lead on climate change, said in an interview. BHP stands apart from other big miners with a goal to make its own operations carbon neutral, in line with the Paris agreement, by the second half of the century. But just as governments have to work out practicalities, it is also unclear how BHP can achieve its goals. “There is no definitive path-way,” Winkelman said, although he repeated a frequent industry request for a carbon price to help shift investment towards a greener technology. Poland’s aim is to share the challenges of bringing about a “just transition”, Polish Deputy Environment Minister Michal Kurtyka, who presided over the talks, said. As a graduate of Paris’ elite Ecole Polytechnique, a physicist, an economist and an engineer, his favored solution is electric vehicles. With fewer moving parts and less wasted heat than internal combustion engines, he says they will help even if they run on coal-fired power. As a citizen of a country that switched in 1989 from “a centrally planned to a market economy,” Kurtyka has first-hand experience of deep change. “In my young days, growing up in Krakow, that was a completely different city from now. At 8 p.m. the lights switched off. You could not open the window because of air pollution,” he said. In Katowice, some residents say they still can’t let the air in and are not confident that is about to change.

2018-12-14,"KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - F ossil fuel-dependent Ukraine will strengthen its climate change action plan under the Paris Agreement to curb global warming, its government said at U.N. climate talks in Poland this week. Four Ukrainian cities also reaffirmed their goal of shifting to 100 percent renewable energy by 2050, announced this year. Svitlana Romanko, Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia director for climate campaign 350.org, said Ukrainian citizens and mayors were showing that a rapid and fair transition to clean energy was “both possible and popular”. “The new national target should reflect and build on these cities’ climate and energy plans,” she added. Ukraine has pledged to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2030, under the 2015 Paris accord. By 2016, its emissions had already fallen 64 percent due to an economic collapse following the break-up of the Soviet Union. Ilya Eremenko, head of the Ukrainian Climate Network, said many cities had set their own goals for reducing emissions, which are far more ambitious than national ones. “A combination of national and local targets is crucial for effective climate policy,” he added. In June, the northwest Ukrainian city of Zhytomyr became the first city in the wider region to adopt a target of using 100 percent renewable energy by 2050, according to its mayor. Three other Ukrainian cities - Kamianets-Podilskyi, Chortkiv and Lviv - have since signed up to the same ambition. In Ukraine, energy is a crucial issue in both international and domestic politics, Zhytomyr Mayor Serhiy Sukhomlyn told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at September’s Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco. Moving to local, clean energy production would end dependence on imported fossil fuels, including natural gas, which can be exploited for political ends, he said. “Hundred percent renewable also means 100 percent energy independence,” Sukhomlyn said. Major rows have flared up several times with Russia over issues such as whether Ukraine siphoned off gas supplies for Europe as they were transported through Russia’s neighbouring state, as well as payments relating to gas supply and transit. Since Russia annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea in 2014, Ukraine imports gas mainly from other European countries, though some of that originates from Russia. And it is aiming to produce more from its own fields, including shale gas, in future. To help end Zhytomyr’s dependency on gas and other fossil fuels, it plans to build a 10-megawatt (MW) solar power plant by mid-2019, and add another 30 MW of solar capacity later. Today, renewable sources account for less than 1 percent of energy used by the city, known as the birthplace of Soviet rocket engineer Sergei Korolev, who played a lead role in launching the first human into space. Zhytomyr is also planning four micro-hydropower plants and three biofuel co-generation plants, replacing close to half the gas used by the city in the next few years. Sukhomlyn said the projects had been made possible by reforms to decentralise energy production in Ukraine. “Local authorities and municipalities are getting a lot of independence”, enabling them to develop partnerships with investors and international financial institutions, he said. The energy transition in the city of just over 250,000 people is supported by donors including Germany, Switzerland and Slovenia, as well as multilateral financial institutions. Sukhomlyn said the city plans to reduce energy consumption by at least 20 percent by 2050 and curb related emissions. To help achieve that, it will retrofit schools and other municipal buildings, put in new electric trolley buses, and use LED bulbs for street lighting. The district heating system will be modernised with boilers that run on biofuels including wood chips and farm waste. The city has also launched a programme to fund energy-efficient insulation for co-owned housing associations. The overall transformation aims to bring down energy prices for households by 10 percent, the city council said. Producing energy locally will be cheaper than importing gas, and efficiency measures will lower usage, it added. The economic rationale for going self-sufficient in energy is key to getting citizens onboard, said the mayor. “Fossil fuel prices have recently been increasing, and switching to local energy sources will provide stable and cheaper alternatives,” Sukhomlyn said. In 2012, Zhytomyr joined the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, an international coalition, and committed to reduce its carbon emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020. Two years later, a working group uniting city government experts, municipal energy companies, scientists and the public drafted a 10-year sustainable energy policy. Climate action group 350.org will help city authorities develop further plans for the transition to renewable energy and craft a climate strategy in 2019 together with inhabitants. “Public demand for clean energy is also an opportunity for city residents to have an influence over the decision makers on local climate and energy solutions,” said Romanko. Activists, meanwhile, have launched an app called “Climate Drops” that rewards green behaviour such as recycling and tree-planting. When residents bring plastic bottles to the recycling centre, for example, they receive points (or “drops”) via the app which can be traded for discounts in restaurants and stores. The app has spread to another 10 cities across the country and has about 1,000 active users. Excluding large hydropower dams, renewable energy accounts for less than 2 percent of Ukraine’s electricity production, said Komila Nabiyeva of Energy Watch Group, a Berlin-based network of scientists and parliamentarians. The government has set a 2020 target to generate 11 percent from renewable sources, but that includes hydropower, which already accounts for 7 percent, making the goal unambitious, said Nabiyeva. This year, Ukraine also published a low-emission development strategy through to 2050, aimed at helping work out how to boost renewable energy and implement energy efficiency measures, while modernising its electricity grid and transport infrastructure. Nabiyeva said a recent study by Energy Watch Group and Finland’s LUT University showed Ukraine’s electricity could be supplied entirely from local renewable energy sources - excluding large hydro dams - by 2050, which would be more cost-effective than today’s system based mainly on coal and nuclear. The government’s current energy strategy, which runs until 2026, prioritises growth in hydropower. While it is aimed at reducing coal-fired production, the plan could be thwarted by strong coal lobby groups, warned Ukrainian energy journalist Sergey Golovnev.

2018-12-14,"MOSCOW, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Palmali, one of the biggest players in Russia’s river-to-sea cargo market, plans to appeal against a court decision declaring its Russian business bankrupt and effectively handing its fleet over to Sberbank, the shipping firm’s owner said on Friday. Last month, a court in Rostov-on-Don in southern Russia declared the Palmali unit bankrupt. The unit owes $180 million to Sberbank, with almost all of its roughly 50 ships held as collateral with Russia’s largest bank. Palmali also owes 1.6 billion roubles ($24 million) to Russia’s tax authorities. Palmali’s owner, Mubariz Mansimov, told Reuters the company, which is headquartered in Istanbul and also operates in the Black and Mediterranean Seas, planned to challenge the ruling. “We will continue legal actions against Sberbank and tax authorities of the Russian Federation,” he added. “For some reasons, Sberbank didn’t want to restructure (our debt).” In an emailed reply to Reuters, Sberbank said bankruptcy proceeding were the best way to resolve the Palmali unit’s debt problems. “Meanwhile, we support the company’s willingness to continue its business as usual until after the bankruptcy process is finished, this would help to preserve the fleet and workers,” Sberbank said. Palmali has around 3,500 staff in Russia. The company has handled large volumes of non-pipeline oil and products exports, plying routes between refineries in the Volga region and Black and Azov Seas. One of its main clients is the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in southern Russia. However, it has suffered from cheaper transport options, such as railways and pipelines. River shipments in Russia, which include cargoes of grains and construction materials, oil products and cars, fell 6.4 percent in 2017 from the year before, according to KPMG. Western sanctions imposed for Moscow’s role in Ukraine’s crisis have also hit some shippers. Mansimov said the sanctions “paralysed” the firm, which uses the Russian flag on most of its vessels operating in Russia. “We can’t enter Ukraine with a Russian flag aboard. There is also pressure from the Western companies. They just don’t want to hand their cargoes to a Russian flag,” he said. $1 = 66.3917 roubles

2018-12-14,"KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Ministers are working around the clock to complete and strengthen the rules for making a landmark agreement to combat climate change operational, with one day of talks remaining. Delegates from nearly 200 nations are on a self-imposed deadline to produce a “rule book” to flesh out details of 2015 Paris Agreement which aims to limit the global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius and which comes into force in 2020. Talks in Katowice, Poland, under way since Dec. 2, have been clouded by political divisions and progress had been slow until some deadlocks were broken and draft texts produced overnight. The drafts show that there has been compromise in some areas, such as language to recognise the importance of a U.N. report on limiting global warming to 1.5C which caused rifts last week, and on finance. “We are entering the final lap. There are still people unhappy but basically it looks good. I think we will make it in the end but not everyone is satisfied yet,” said German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze. It will be a long night in the sprawling Spodek conference venue, a flying saucer-shaped concert and sports hall, as teams continue to haggle over the texts in groups. “This is a start, but far from finished business. Compromise texts are paid for in human lives lost and the poor and vulnerable are calling for so much more,” said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International. Delegates said concerns remained about the rules for implementing Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and whether they can be beefed up to avoid double-counting of emissions and weakening the integrity of environmental markets. A big issue for countries most vulnerable to climate change is a mechanism to find ways to cover the growing costs of “loss and damage”, which has been relegated to a footnote in the draft. Greater clarity is also sought on what countries will do after leaving Poland and how they will strengthen their commitments and targets under the agreement.

2018-12-14,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Around $150 millions’ worth of oil was stolen from Shell’s biggest global refinery over several years, Singapore court documents reviewed by Reuters show, far more than reported when police first revealed the heist earlier this year.  Almost a year on from raids that led to over a dozen arrests, including of several former employees of the local unit of Royal Dutch Shell, charge sheets state that around 340,000 tonnes of gasoil were stolen from the oil major’s Pulau Bukom site in Singapore, in incidents dating back to 2014.  Charges filed in the first few months of investigations after police raids in January related to the theft of around $10 million in oil. Further charges levied in May showed a total of $40 million had been stolen.  A spokeswoman for Shell said the firm is “disappointed”, adding that it has been working with investigators and taken measures to avoid repeat incidents at the Pulau Bukom facility, which lies just south of Singapore’s main island.  “These include closer monitoring of products moving in and out of Bukom, tightening vessel management procedures, and stepping up ethics and compliance training,” the spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters on Thursday.  Southeast Asia is a hot spot for illegal fuel trading, with its island-dotted waters providing cover for small-scale smuggling of oil products across borders. But the regularity and audacity of the thefts at Shell’s refining facility - some of which took place during working hours - stand out.  “Fuel is both ubiquitous and untraceable, making its theft a seemingly low-risk criminal operation compared to something like drug smuggling or arms trafficking, where the concern about being caught is much higher,” said Ian Ralby, a maritime crime expert who works with both the U.N. and the U.S.-based think tank Atlantic Council.  “That false sense of security leads to some fairly brazen forms of theft.”  Fuel theft could be worth $133 billion a year globally, according to industry estimates, although Ralby said that figure might be conservative.  The case in Singapore looks like it could drag on, given the routine addition of new charges and amendments to older charges. The police investigation is still ongoing.  “We are at the stage that the charges are still being rearranged ... it’s quite far from final sentencing,” said Ho Lifen, a lawyer at Rajah & Tann representing one of the accused former Shell employees, Cai Zhi Zhong.  Besides the former Shell employees, there have been related charges filed against former employees of one of Singapore’s biggest marine fuel suppliers, Sentek Marine & Trading Pte Ltd; a Singaporean who worked for Intertek, a British-listed company specializing in quality and quantity assurance, including for fuel products; and three Vietnamese nationals who allegedly received stolen property aboard ships.

2018-12-14,"* Chinese data stokes worries over oil demand outlook * OPEC-led deal to cut supply supports crude prices * IEA expects deficit in oil supply by Q2 next year (Updates throughout, changes dateline, previous SINGAPORE) By Christopher Johnson LONDON, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped on Friday after China reported slower economic growth, pointing to lower fuel demand in the world’s biggest oil importer, although market sentiment was supported by supply cuts agreed last week by major crude producers. Benchmark Brent crude was down 40 cents at $61.05 per barrel by 0820 GMT, on course for a decline this week of around 1 percent. U.S. light crude was 25 cents lower at $52.33. China, the world’s No.2 economy, on Friday reported some of its slowest growth in retail sales and industrial output in years, highlighting the risks of the country’s trade dispute with the United States. Chinese oil refinery throughput in November fell from October, suggesting an easing in oil demand, though runs were 2.9 percent above levels a year earlier. Concerned by mounting oversupply, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers including Russia agreed last week to reduce output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), or more than 1 percent of global demand. “For the time being until the OPEC cuts start kicking in, the market is oversupplied in the short term,” said Tony Nunan, oil risk manager at Mitsubishi Corp. “If China is slowing down, that’s definitely a concern.” The International Energy Agency said on Thursday that it expected a deficit in oil supply to emerge by the second quarter of next year, provided OPEC members and other key producers stuck closely to last week’s deal to cut output. “The OPEC cuts will have a substantial impact on 1Q19 balances compared with this quarter, but market observers may need to wait for the cuts to percolate to inventory data,” Barclays analyst Michael Cohen said in a note. As part of the agreement, de facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia plans to reduce its output to 10.2 million bpd in January. The IEA kept its 2019 forecast for global oil demand growth at 1.4 million bpd, unchanged from its projection last month, and said it expected growth of 1.3 million bpd this year. “Our market balance looks 0.5 million bpd tighter next year on reduced OPEC supply, such that the surplus is just 0.2 million bpd,” Cohen said.

2018-12-14,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Stocks worldwide tumbled on Friday after weak economic data from China and Europe fanned concerns of a global economic slowdown and left investors fretting over the wider impact of a still-unresolved Sino-U.S. trade dispute. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks stocks across 47 countries, was down half a percent. Euro zone business ended the year on a weak note, expanding at the slowest pace in over four years as new order growth all but dried up, hurt by trade tensions and violent protests in France, a survey showed. Another survey showed French business activity plunged unexpectedly into contraction this month, retreating at the fastest pace in over four years in the face of violent anti-government protests. Germany’s private sector expansion slowed to a four-year low, meanwhile, suggesting growth in Europe’s largest economy may be weak in the final quarter. The data out of Europe added to weak readings from China, where November retail sales grew at the weakest pace since 2003 and industrial output rose the least in nearly three years, underlining risks to the economy as Beijing works to defuse a trade dispute with the United States. Stock markets in Europe opened sharply lower, with Germany’s DAX index falling 1-1/2 percent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 1.3 percent. “The data this morning out of France really hasn’t helped the mood. You look at China data, you look at the flash PMIs out of France and Germany and they’ve really sort of reinforced concerns that the global economy is slowing down,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. “Ultimately, I think it rather questions the wisdom of the ECB ending its asset purchase programme at the end of this month. You’ve got Mario Draghi basically tightening into a downturn.” MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.5 percent. Japan’s Nikkei, also dragged down by the country’s weak tankan sentiment index, dropped 2.0 percent. China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite and the blue-chip CSI 300 closed down 1.5 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was off 1.5 percent. A Chinese statistics bureau spokesman said the November data showed downward pressure on the economy is increasing. The data “means that the worst is yet to come and policymakers will be very worried, particularly with consumption growth falling off a cliff,” said Sue Trinh, head of Asia FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Hong Kong. “So I expect further support measures including rate cuts will come in coming weeks, although these data would indicate measures to date aren’t really working.” The Chinese yuan weakened 0.4 percent to 6.9063 per dollar in offshore trade following the data. “Although hopes of progress in U.S.-China talks and cheap valuations are supporting the market for now, we have lots of potential pitfalls,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. “If U.S. shares fall below their triple bottoms hit recently, that would be a very weak technical sign.” Overnight on Wall Street, the S&P 500 ticked down 0.02 percent to 2,650, not far from its 6-1/2-month closing low of 2,633 touched on Nov. 23, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.39 percent. U.S. corporate earnings due next month could throw a spotlight on the impact from the U.S. tariffs on imports from China, while there is risk of a government shutdown and further political stalemate in a divided U.S. congress, Kuramochi added. In the currency market, the euro was down 0.7 percent after the weak PMIs, last changing hands at $1.1293. Sterling’s rally fizzled as signs that the British parliament was headed towards a deadlock over Brexit prompted traders to take profits from its gains made after Prime Minister Theresa May had survived a no-confidence vote. The European Union has said the agreed Brexit deal is not open for renegotiation even though its leaders on Thursday gave May assurances that they would seek to agree a new pact with Britain by 2021 so that the contentious Irish “backstop” is never triggered. The pound fell 0.6 percent to $1.2615, on track to post its fifth consecutive week of losses. It was down 0.9 percent so far this week. The dollar stood at 113.48 yen, down 0.1 percent on the day but above this week’s low of 112.245 set on Monday. Oil prices gave up some of their Thursday’s gains following inventory declines in the United States and expectations that the global oil market could have a deficit sooner than they had previously thought. U.S. crude futures edged down 0.5 percent to $52.32 per barrel and Brent crude slipped 0.6 percent to $61.09, after both gained more than 2.5 percent on Thursday. Cryptocurrency Bitcoin fell as low as $3,200, a fresh 15-month low.

2018-12-14,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Coal railway workers at Australian hauler Aurizon Holdings Ltd have postponed some planned strikes in Queensland, a union official said, as a cyclone is forecast to bring poor weather near some of the affected railways.  Aurizon’s four major railways in the Bowen Basin of Queensland, the world’s largest coking coal export region, carry coal from mines owned by BHP Billiton, Glencore, Anglo American and Peabody Energy to ports on the country’s east coast. Bruce Mackie, the Queensland president of the Rail, Tram and Bus Union, which represents train crews and maintenance workers at Aurizon, said by phone that planned stoppages on Friday went ahead but that some other strikes were deferred by seven days. “We are delaying in the best interests of our members,” he said, citing their safety given the storm forecast. Cyclone Owen, a category three storm in the Gulf of Carpentaria, is predicted to hit Queensland’s far north over the weekend. Poor weather has already prompted the Abbot Point Coal Terminal to halt unloading at midnight (1400 GMT) on Friday, Aurizon said, so the hauler has canceled trains on its Newlands line, which runs to the port, until further notice. The strikes at Aurizon had been called after a breakdown in negotiations over pay and rostering. Aurizon, which had previously called the strikes disappointing and unnecessary, said in a statement its rail services will now keep going on its Goonyella corridor, though strikes there and on its Newlands line are now planned for Dec. 22. A BHP spokesman said on Thursday the strikes would have no “material impact” and had no further comment on Friday. A Glencore spokesman said the company had no comment. Peabody had no immediate comment and Anglo American did not immediately reply to an email sent after business hours. Aurizon shares closed flat on Friday while the broader market dropped by a percentage point.

2018-12-14,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) snapped a three-week losing streak to end higher this week, with the onset of winter expected to boost demand for natural gas for heating. But gains were limited amid forecasts of warmer-than-usual temperatures for most of next week in Tokyo, Beijing and Seoul, the top demand centers for natural gas in Asia, and as more spot supply entered the market from the United States and Russia.    Spot prices for January delivery edged up about 10 cents to around $8.90 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), with cargoes trading from as low as $8.50 per mmBtu to as high as $9.10 per mmBtu, several industry sources said. Prices for February delivery also inched higher and were estimated at around $9.10 to $9.30 per mmBtu, keeping the price curve in contango.  “The (spot) market has probably bottomed out with (prices) being pretty flat and I am hearing of more people looking for cargoes,” said a Singapore-based LNG trader.  China, the world’s No. 2 LNG importer, has ramped up both domestic gas production and imports to meet rising demand as the government switches more households to gas heating this winter.  China’s November natural gas output climbed 10 percent to a record-high of 14.3 billion cubic meters (bcm), official data showed on Friday.  It has switched another 3.29 million households to gas heating this winter, Reuters calculations show, more than it added last year. But analysts said the increase would not necessarily boost overall consumption in the country. “Till now, China’s demand is increasing, but it has not affected the inventory too much,” a trader familiar with the Chinese market said. With forecasts of a warmer-than-usual week next week, LNG buyers in China are taking a wait-and-see approach before deciding to ramp up imports of the super-chilled fuel, he said.  Taiwan’s CPC Corp entered the spot market to seek a cargo for delivery in January, while South Korea’s state-run Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) is looking for long-term supply starting from 2025, traders said. On the supply side, Cheniere Energy (LNG.A) loaded the commissioning cargo of LNG from its Corpus Christi liquefaction facility in Texas, the third big LNG export terminal to enter service in the lower 48 U.S. states.  Greece this week said it would import its first U.S. LNG cargο of 150,000 cubic meters on Dec. 29 from Cheniere. Russia’s Yamal LNG has started up train 3 at its plant, 12 months ahead of schedule, with the plant reaching full capacity of 16.5 million tonnes a year.

2018-12-14,"* Asian shares extend losses after disappointing Chinese data * Worries about U.S.-China collision also keep investors on edge * Euro steady a day after ECB ends QE but keeps reinvestments * Spread-betters see European markets opening lower By Hideyuki Sano and Tomo Uetake TOKYO, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Asian shares tumbled on Friday after China reported a set of weak data, fanning fresh worries of a slowdown in the world’s second-biggest economy and leaving investors fretting over the wider impact of a yet unresolved Sino-U.S. trade dispute. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.3 percent. Japan’s Nikkei, also dragged down by the country’s weak tankan sentiment index, dropped 2.0 percent. China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite and the blue-chip CSI 300 closed down 1.5 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was off 1.5 percent. Financial spread-betters expect London’s FTSE Frankfurt’s DAX and Paris’s CAC to fall between 0.7 and 0.8 percent when they open. China’s November retail sales grew at the weakest pace since 2003 and industrial output rose the least in nearly three years as domestic demand softened further, underlining rising risks to the economy as Beijing works to defuse a trade dispute with the United States. A Chinese statistics bureau spokesman said the November data showed downward pressure on the economy is increasing. The data “means that the worst is yet to come and policymakers will be very worried, particularly with consumption growth falling off a cliff,” said Sue Trinh, head of Asia FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Hong Kong. “So I expect further support measures including rate cuts will come in coming weeks, although these data would indicate measures to date aren’t really working.” The Chinese yuan weakened 0.15 percent to 6.8888 per dollar in offshore trade following the data. “Although hopes of progress in U.S.-China talks and cheap valuations are supporting the market for now, we have lots of potential pitfalls,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. “If U.S. shares fall below their triple bottoms hit recently, that would be a very weak technical sign.” Overnight on Wall Street, the S&P 500 ticked down 0.02 percent to 2,650, not far from its 6-1/2-month closing low of 2,633 touched on Nov. 23, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.39 percent. U.S. corporate earnings due next month could throw a spotlight on the impact from the U.S. tariffs on imports from China, while there is risk of a government shutdown and further political stalemate in a divided U.S. congress, Kuramochi added. In the currency market, the euro stuck in its well-worn $1.13-$1.14 range over the past few days, a day after the European Central Bank ended its 2.6 trillion euro bond purchase scheme but pledged to continue reinvesting maturing bonds -thereby avoiding shrinking its balance sheet- for an extended period of time. The common currency last changed hands at $1.1352. “With Thursday’s decision, the ECB is only taking very lightly the foot off the accelerator of monetary policy, which is by no means a real normalisation of monetary policy,” said Oliver Eichmann, co-head of EMEA fixed income at DWS in Frankfurt. Sterling’s rally fizzled as signs that the British parliament was headed towards a deadlock over Brexit prompted traders to take profits from its gains made after Prime Minister Theresa May had survived a no-confidence vote. The European Union has said the agreed Brexit deal is not open for renegotiation even though its leaders on Thursday gave May assurances that they would seek to agree a new pact with Britain by 2021 so that the contentious Irish “backstop” is never triggered. The pound fell 0.4 percent to $1.2615, on track to post its fifth consecutive week of losses. It was down 0.9 percent so far this week. The dollar stood at 113.57 yen, flat on the day but above this week’s low of 112.245 set on Monday. The kiwi fell as much as 1.0 percent to $0.6861 after the central bank said it was considering almost doubling the required capital banks would need to hold to bolster the financial system’s capacity to handle any shocks. Oil prices gave up some of their Thursday’s gains following inventory declines in the United States and expectations that the global oil market could have a deficit sooner than they had previously thought. U.S. crude futures edged down 0.6 percent to $52.27 per barrel and Brent crude slipped 0.8 percent to $60.94, after both gained more than 2.5 percent on Thursday. Cryptocurrency Bitcoin fell as low as $3,200, a fresh 15-month low.

2018-12-14,"* Refiners scale back runs from Sept, Oct as prices fall * Throughput headed for annual record as refinery starts up * Natural gas output at record as heating season starts * China expected to consume 270 bcm of gas in 2018 (Adds background of Hengli refinery starting test runs, export quotas being issued) By Meng Meng and Chen Aizhu BEIJING/SINGAPORE, Dec 14 (Reuters) - China’s November refinery throughput rose from a year earlier, heading for an annual record, official data indicated on Friday, although the runs eased from highs touched in the previous two months as product inventories swelled and sales slowed. Refineries in November processed 50.46 million tonnes of crude oil, or 12.28 million barrels per day, up 2.9 percent from the same month last year, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the National Bureau of Statistics. The daily crude processing rates, however, came off 12.43 million bpd in October and a record of 12.49 million bpd in September, the statistics data showed. The fall from the September-October peaks came as the government lowered prices for gasoline and diesel in November to track a steep drop in global crude prices, and to counter a sharp slowdown in local sales that started in mid-October. “China’s state planner lowered gasoline and diesel prices three times in November. Both teapots and state refiners were under pressure to sell products to meet their annual sales target,” said Han Cong, products analyst with consultancy JLC. She added that private refiners’ utilisation rates fell to 63.22 percent in the first week of December from 65.71 percent at the start of November, further indication of the pressure plants are under to scale back operations amid slowing sales. Still, for the first 11 months, refinery output gained 7.2 percent to 554.48 million tonnes, or 12.12 million bpd, on track for an annual record. The slowing domestic products sales have also prompted state refiners to seek additional fuel export quotas to release some of the glut. Crude throughput is still expected to increase over last year levels in December as a new refinery starts up. China’s private refiner Hengli Petrochemical said on Wednesday it plans test operations at its 400,000-bpd refinery in Dalian on Dec. 15, which is likely to be reflected more fully in the country’s refinery output in January. China’s November natural gas production rose 10 percent to a record of 14.3 billion cubic meters (bcm), the data showed, to cope with heating demand that typically starts every year from around mid-November. China ramped up both domestic output and imports to meet rising demand from households as the government switched another 3 million households to gas heating this winter. For January-November, gas output was up 6.6 percent from a year ago at 143.8 bcm. China is expected to consume 270 bcm of gas this year, the chairwoman of Beijing Gas, the dominant gas distributor in China’s capital, said on Thursday. That represents a rise of 12.5 percent, in line with an earlier estimate by consultancy SIA Energy. China’s crude oil output in November fell 1.3 percent from the same month last year, and was down 1.6 percent versus a year earlier for the first 11 months, the data showed. 1 tonne of crude = 7.3 barrels

2018-12-14,"* China produced 2.82 mln T of aluminium last month * Up around 4 pct from Oct, 19 pct from Nov last year * That came despite weakness in aluminium prices * Analysts had expected fourth straight monthly drop (Recasts, adds analyst comment) By Tom Daly BEIJING, Dec 14 (Reuters) - China’s primary aluminium output rebounded in November after three straight months of decline, defying a fall in prices for the metal used in everything from construction to making cars. Analysts were surprised by the climb, which came as smelters apparently ramped up output ahead of winter production curbs that kicked in around the middle of the month. The world’s top aluminium maker produced 2.82 million tonnes of the material last month, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Friday. That was up 3.9 percent from 2.72 million tonnes in October and up 19.2 percent from November 2017, the bureau said. On a daily basis, China produced 94,000 tonnes of aluminium last month, versus around 88,000 tonnes in October, according to Reuters calculations. That was the highest daily rate since July, when the monthly total of 2.93 million tonnes matched the all-time high. November has one less day than October. Shanghai aluminium prices fell by 2.8 percent over November and hit two-year lows, leaving smelters struggling to turn a profit in a well-supplied market. “New capacity increases (probably) outpaced the capacity closures,” said Helen Lau, an analyst at Argonaut Securities in Hong Kong. Lower prices for raw materials bauxite and alumina may also have been a factor, she added. “The cost pressure is lower and that also helps (smelters) to increase production.” Paul Adkins, managing director of AZ China, said his consultancy’s own output numbers for November showed a 1.6-percent drop from October amid capacity closures. State-run Aluminum Corp of China Ltd , known as Chalco, said on Nov. 30 that it was cutting 470,000 tonnes of annual capacity due to market conditions and environmental protection requirements. China is waging a self-styled ‘war on pollution’ after years of breakneck economic growth. Top producer China Hongqiao Group has been ordered to close up to 550,000 tonnes of annual smelting capacity for the winter heating season that started in mid-November, according to analyst calculations. Over the first 11 months of 2018, China produced 31.45 million tonnes of aluminium, up 7.5 percent year-on-year and on course for record annual output, the NBS data showed. Meanwhile, output of 10 nonferrous metals - including copper, aluminium, lead, zinc and nickel - came in at 4.71 million tonnes in November, up 4.2 percent from October and up 12.7 percent year-on-year. On a daily basis, production came to 157,000 tonnes, the highest since June 2017. January-November output was up 6.1 percent at 50.43 million tonnes. The other metals in the group are tin, antimony, mercury, magnesium and titanium.

A Chinese commerce ministry spokesman said on Thursday China and the United States are in close contact over trade and that any U.S. trade delegation would be welcome to visit. But that has hardly dispelled concerns about a broadening confrontation between the two economic heavyweights. China said on Thursday a Canadian businessman is being investigated on suspicion of harming China’s security, days after a former Canadian diplomat was detained in an escalating diplomatic row. The moves are seen as a reaction to Canada’s arrest on Dec. 1 of Chinese executive Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies, for extradition to the United States. . The euro changed hands at $1.1362, stuck in its well-worn $1.13-$1.14 range over the past few days. The European Central Bank ended its 2.6 trillion euro crisis-fighting bond purchase scheme but pledged to continue reinvesting maturing bonds - thereby avoiding shrinking its balance sheet - for an extended period of time. The plan lifted Portuguese and Irish government bond prices sharply on Thursday. “We expect the first rate hike in the fall of 2019.
