2018-04-29,"LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistani opposition figure Imran Khan on Sunday vowed to sweep to power in upcoming elections, promising radical change for the poor at a campaign kick-off rally in the city of Lahore that has long been the power base of ousted premier Nawaz Sharif. With the red-brick minarets of Lahore’s Mughal-era Badshahi mosque in sight, Khan outlined a populist 11-point plan to usher in a new era of prosperity that he envisages for Pakistan after the general election at which he hopes to become prime minister. “Today we are at crossroads,” said Khan, a former cricketing hero and founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party.  “It is time to change our destiny and think big.” Khan told a boisterous crowd of about 100,000 people that Pakistan was “heading towards destruction” but his plan would help forge a fairer society and steer Pakistan towards a path first envisaged by the nation’s father, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Khan said that if elected he would build schools and “world class hospitals” across the country, while farmers would get cheap loans. He also pledged to build 5 million homes for the poor, which would create jobs and stimulate the economy. After spending much of his post-cricket political career on the fringes, Khan has in recent years emerged as a key challenger to Sharif, a three-time prime minister who was ousted by the Supreme Court last year but whose party retains power. Sharif’s legal woes, which the veteran leader says are politically motivated, could further boost Khan in the run up to the elections as an anti-corruption court is due to soon deliver a verdict on another Sharif trial. Khan has predicted Sharif will be jailed before the polls, likely in July. Khan, who has sought to shed his playboy image of the past, is betting that his anti-corruption message, coupled with anti-America rhetoric and a projecting image of pious devotion, will propel him into power in the deeply conservative Muslim nation of 208 million people. In Lahore, Khan’s message resonated with many of the bandana-wearing young men waving PTI’s green and red-colour flags. “Imran Khan has given us the slogan of ‘New Pakistan’ and that’s what we want,” said Shahzad Khan, 17, in reference to the “Naya Pakistan” slogan used by PTI. Sharif has accused Khan of being a puppet of the powerful military establishment that has a history of meddling in Pakistani politics. Khan denies colluding with the army and the military denies interfering in modern-day politics. To dislodge Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, Khan’s PTI will have to make inroads into Pakistan’s biggest province, which is home to 110 million people and a well-oiled PML-N electoral machine built over several decades. Sharif was the chief minister of Punjab in the 1980s and his younger brother Shahbaz has ruled the province since 2008, entrenching PML-N’s support across the wealthiest of Pakistan’s four provinces. “We feel they are weakening with every day,” Khan told foreign journalist ahead of the rally. He added that unlike in 2013, when PML-N swept to power, this time around many of the so-called “electables” - politicians who carry large rural vote banks due to their status as tribal elders, feudal lords and heads of various clans - will switch allegiances away from PML-N to PTI.   “The electables...weigh things up, they want to be on the winning side,” Khan told foreign media. But at the Lahore rally, Khan shunned talk of electables and focused on promising a new dawn for Pakistan’s poor. “This system cannot run unless we stand up with the downtrodden,” he said. “I am standing with you, it is time of make new Pakistan.” Additional reporting by Syed Raza Hassan in KARACHI; Writing by Drazen Jorgic; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg",https://uk.reuters.com/article/pakistan-politics-khan/pakistans-imran-khan-woos-poor-vows-radical-change-in-election-pitch-idUKL8N1S608O,29 Apr 2018,"Pakistani opposition

2018-04-29,"AMMAN (Reuters) - U.S-backed Syrian Democratic Forces said they expelled had Syrian troops that briefly took control of a string of villages in oil rich areas east of the Euphrates river near the Iraqi border on Sunday.  SDF forces led by the Kurdish YPG militia said they had waged a counter-attack against Syrian troops it said were backed by Russian forces, adding they were driven “far away” from four villages they had seized earlier in the day. “Our forces regained the initiative,” they said in a statement. It did not say if the U.S. coalition took part in the operation. Washington has a strong military presence in the area in eastern Syria which holds the bulk of the country’s oil and gas reserves, according to regional diplomatic sources. A U.S. army statement sent to Reuters confirmed the attack on SDF forces by what it called pro-regime forces near Deir al-Zor city and said the “coalition used established deconfliction channels to de-escalate the situation”, without elaborating. “The coalition remains committed to our SDF partners in the campaign to defeat Daesh (Islamic State) in eastern Syria,” the statement added. A Western diplomatic source earlier told Reuters U.S. coalition jets from bases in northern Syria hit the attacking forces which were believed to include Iranian-backed militias operating in Deir al-Zor area. Iranian-backed forces led by Iraqi and Lebanese Hezbolah Shi’ite militias played a major role in defeating the militants last year in eastern Syria.  A source in the SDF also confirmed coalition forces had intervened. Earlier, the Syrian army said it had captured a string of villages east of the Euphrates near the border with Iraq held by Kurdish-led forces, state television said. It gave no explanation for the move. The U.S.-backed proxy forces spearheaded by the YPG since last year control much of the territory east of the Euphrates in Deir al-Zor province as part of a major aerial and ground campaign led by the Pentagon that drove Islamic State militants from eastern Syria and their former de facto capital Raqqa.  The Russian-backed Syrian army has rarely clashed with SDF forces in its campaign against Islamic State and had kept away from their areas east of the Euphrates, focusing on regaining territory from the militants west of the river. There have been elaborate “deconfliction lines” separating the coalition forces on the eastern side of the river from the Russian and Iranian backed forces on the western side to prevent clashes, U.S army officials and defence analysts say.  In February, U.S. airstrikes killed and wounded hundreds of pro-government forces including Russian paramilitary contractors advancing near the eastern city of Deir al-Zor towards one of the largest gas fields in the hands of U.S.-backed forces. Before the announcement that the Syrian army had taken control of the villages, the SDF said they were engaged in heavy clashes with Syrian army troops on the outskirts of the village of Janin near the Euphrates. They accused Syrian authorities of seeking to disrupt preparations by the U.S.-led coalition to resume an imminent offensive against Islamic State in several pockets of territory along the middle Euphrates River Valley that they still control. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Thursday he expected a “re-energized” effort against Islamic State militants in eastern Syria in the coming days. U.S. officials have said that in recent days they have seen SDF fighters returning to the area of the Euphrates where the militants operate to relaunch new operations against them. The Kurdish-led militia has blamed a Turkish offensive in Afrin against it for diverting efforts away from the fight against the militants.

2018-04-29,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt said on Sunday it wants talks over a dam Ethiopia is building speeded up in a sign of its apparent frustration over what it sees as footdragging by Addis Ababa over the dispute. Egypt and Ethiopia are at loggerheads over the construction of the Grand Renaissance Dam, a $4 billion (£2.9 billion)-hydroelectric project that Cairo fears will reduce waters that run to its fields and reservoirs from Ethiopia’s highlands and via Sudan. Addis Ababa hopes the dam will make it a hub for the electricity-hungry region and denies it will undermine Egypt’s access to water.  Ties between Egypt and Sudan were strained when Khartoum backed the dam because of its need for electricity. “There’s a need to accelerate the pace of negotiations after some three years or more have passed since the signing of the preliminary agreement in Khartoum and things have remained frozen,” Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told a joint news conference with his visiting French counterpart in Cairo. The three African neighbours are set to meet on May 15 for further talks, Shoukry said, adding that Egypt had initially proposed several nearer dates for negotiations, but they were turned down by the two other countries.  “We continue to show flexibility and continue in a positive direction, but taking into account that we must achieve the progress that leads to achieving common interests, and also that there is a time frame for all countries that must be taken into consideration,” Shoukry said.  Earlier this month, talks in Khartoum between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan failed to reach agreement, but were described by the Sudanese foreign minister as “constructive”. The countries’ technical committees will meet on May 4, Shoukry said.

2018-04-29,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s interior minister Amber Rudd was under growing pressure on Sunday after a challenge to her testimony on the deportation of immigrants prompted fresh calls for her resignation. The Guardian newspaper reported a letter from Rudd to Prime Minister Theresa May last year in which she stated an “ambitious but deliverable” aim for an increase in the enforced deportation of immigrants. Earlier, her former deputy said he discussed with her attempts to increase the number of government deportations, but he said the increase was an ambition rather than a target.  The controversy surrounding one of May’s closest allies coincides with Britain entering crucial negotiations on a future trade deal with the European Union and amid rising domestic tension over Brexit policy. For the last two weeks, British ministers have struggled to explain why some descendants of the so-called “Windrush generation”, invited to Britain from Caribbean nations to plug labour shortfalls between 1948 and 1971, are being denied basic rights because of trouble documenting their status. The scandal overshadowed the Commonwealth summit in London earlier this month and has raised questions about May’s six-year stint as interior minister before she became prime minister in the wake of the 2016 Brexit referendum. The government has apologised for the fiasco, promised citizenship and compensation to those affected, including to people who have lost their jobs, been threatened with deportation and denied benefits because of the errors. But more than 200 mainly opposition members of parliament have written to the prime minister calling for the pledges to be written into law “without delay”. The letter accuses the Rudd of making up policy “on the hoof” to defuse the situation. Rudd is due to make a statement to parliament on Monday after giving contradictory statements about whether the government has immigration removal targets. The pressure on Rudd to stand down increased after she said the government didn’t have targets for deporting people — only for a memo to emerge mentioning specific targets for enforced removals. Rudd was facing new questions about whether she misled parliament after her former deputy said on Sunday he discussed with her a plan to increase deportations by 10 percent. Brandon Lewis, now the Conservative Party chairman, told the BBC in an interview that targets were “very different” from an aim to increase the number of removals referred to in the memo. Labour accused him of “hiding behind semantics” in an effort to save Rudd’s career. “He let the truth slip and sealed her fate. Amber Rudd knew of the targets she pretended didn’t exist,” the shadow interior minister Diane Abbott said. “It’s time for Rudd to go.” In a separate letter, Abbott has called for a full inquiry into whether the interior minister misled parliament and breached the ministerial code. Abbott said Rudd’s explanations as to why she had told members of parliament there were no such targets, when in fact there were, “stretch credulity to the limit”. But May’s office said there is no need for an investigation because ministerial code only requires a resignation if a minister knowingly misleads parliament - a charge the interior minister denies.

2018-04-29,"YEREVAN (Reuters) - Armenia’s ruling party said on Sunday it would not stop protest leader Nikol Pashinyan becoming interim prime minister if all opposition factions in parliament support his candidacy.   More than two weeks of anti-government protests forced the resignation of Republican Party veteran Serzh Sarksyan as prime minister and the party has said it will not put forward one of its own members to replace him, in a bid to calm tensions.    Pashinyan, a former journalist turned lawmaker, has said parliament must elect him prime minister on May 1.  He is so far the only person to put himself forward and, as of Sunday, had received the support of all opposition parties in parliament that hold 47 seats of the 105-seat legislature where the Republicans have a majority.  After talks with Pashinyan on Sunday, the parliamentary leader of the Republican Party, Vahram Baghdasaryan, said the party would not “impede the election of the people’s candidate” if all three opposition factions in parliament supported him. The announcement coincided with the resumption of protests in the capital Yerevan after a two-day moratorium during which demonstrations against the Republican Party and official corruption were held in smaller cities.  Addressing demonstrators on Yerevan’s Republic Square, Pashinyan said he would meet with lawmakers on Monday and called for his supporters to refrain from acts of civil disobedience. Although demonstrations have been peaceful, the upheaval has threatened to destabilise Armenia, a close ally of Russia in a volatile region riven by a decades-long, low-level conflict with neighbouring Azerbaijan.

2018-04-29,"* Gulf markets mixed after strong opening * Islamic lender Alinma weighs on Saudi index * Shuaa Capital lifts Dubai market * Dana Gas pulls Abu Dhabi down after UK dividend order * Industries Qatar’s results support index By Davide Barbuscia DUBAI, April 29 (Reuters) - After a strong opening on the back of last week’s firm oil prices, Gulf stock markets were mixed on Sunday, with the Qatari index lifted by Industries Qatar’s positive first quarter results and Dana Gas weighing on the Abu Dhabi exchange. The Saudi index lost 0.3 percent after rising in early trade. Blue chip Saudi Basic Industries Corp lost 0.6 percent despite reporting a 5.4 percent rise in first-quarter net profit, broadly in line with analysts’ forecasts. Islamic lender Alinma, one of the most heavily traded stocks, climbed 0.5 percent early on Sunday but had dropped 0.7 percent by the market close. The bank reported a quarterly profit rise of 38 percent year on year. But according to a note by SICO Research, Alinma was trading at a “demanding valuation” compared to banking peers in Saudi Arabia. The note also said the bank’s dividend yield was “moderate” at 4 percent. In Dubai, the index was up 0.2 percent, lifted by Shuaa Capital, the market’s most heavily traded stock, which gained 5.7 percent to 1.11 dirhams ($0.3022). Shuaa began rebounding from an 18-month low last Thursday and is testing technical resistance on its 200-day average, now at 1.14 dirhams, which it has not exceeded since June 2017. The company said last week it had completed the acquisition of Integrated Capital and brokerage subsidiary Integrated Securities, which became the third company to offer technical short-selling services on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. Emaar Malls rose 1.4 percent as it announced a first quarter net profit of 548 million dirhams on Sunday, up from 539 million dirhams one year earlier. In Abu Dhabi, energy producer Dana Gas, by large the most traded stock on Sunday, dropped 5 percent, pushing the index down 0.2 percent. Late last week, an English court refused the company’s application to overturn a previous order restraining Dana Gas from distributing dividends to its shareholders for 2017. A London high court judge ordered Dana to pay any dividends into an English bank account where the funds must be held until the company’s dispute with creditors over its $700 million Islamic bond is resolved, sources told Reuters on Friday. Qatar’s index gained 0.6 percent as Industries Qatar rose 3.7 percent after posting a 37 percent rise in first-quarter net profit to 1.3 billion riyals ($357.06 million); the average forecast of three analysts polled by Reuters had been 1.10 billion riyals. * The index shed 0.3 percent to 8,225 points. * The index climbed 0.2 percent to 3,048 points. * The index dropped 0.2 percent to 4,685 points. * The index gained 0.6 percent to 9,140 points. * The index fell 0.7 percent to 4,775 points. * The index was little changed at 1,263 points. * The index rose 0.2 percent to 4,734 points. * The index slipped 0.3 percent to 18,304 points. $1 = 3.6730 UAE dirham

2018-04-29,"DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - An audit of Saudi Aramco’s oil reserves - an essential part of the preparatory work for its planned initial public offering - has found the state oil giant to have higher reserves than it previously reported, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.  Saudi Arabia’s reserves of easily recoverable oil have long been the world’s largest. Two sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the independent external audit has found the proven oil reserves to be at least 270 billion barrels, which is slightly higher than the 260.8 billion barrels the company reported in its 2016 annual review.  Having an internationally recognised reserves audit has become a key task for Aramco as it seeks to become the world’s most valuable company when it lists a 5 percent stake in an IPO later this year or early 2019. Aramco’s official reserves figures were “more than confirmed” said one source. “This is good for the company’s valuation,” another source said.  Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment. For nearly 30 years - despite rising production, large swings in oil prices and improved technology - Riyadh has annually reported the same number for reserves at around 261 billion barrels, according to BP’s statistical review. A reserves total significantly above or below the 261 billion figure would likely affect Aramco’s potential market value in the listing and is being closely watched by investors. Dallas-based DeGolyer and MacNaughton, and Gaffney, Cline and Associates, part of Baker Hughes BHI.N, are involved in the auditing, sources have said.  Baker Hughes and DeGolyer did not respond to a request for comment.    The sale of a stake in Aramco is a centrepiece of Vision 2030, an ambitious reform plan to diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil which is championed by Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. No decision about the location of the international share listing has been announced, fuelling market speculation the IPO could be delayed or shelved. But Prince Mohammad told Reuters in March the IPO could still take place at the end of 2018 or in early 2019, depending on financial market conditions. The New York stock exchange is in the running for the IPO, alongside London and Hong Kong, but Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih has told Reuters that there was a risk of legal action if Aramco was listed in the United States. The Aramco board meets next in early May in Houston where they will review the latest IPO developments, sources said. Aramco said on Sunday it has appointed new members to its board including a female executive, a milestone for Saudi Arabia and the oil industry where there are few women executives.

2018-04-29,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India has electrified all its villages 12 days ahead of a deadline set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government said on Sunday, which could give the ruling party a boost ahead of a general election in 2019. Asia’s third-largest economy has been held back for years by a power shortage, with industries having to cope with blackouts and hospitals forced to rely on diesel-run generators for backup. But Modi said on Sunday that April 28, on the evening of which a remote village in the northeast became the last to be connected to the grid, would be remembered as a “historic day in the development journey of India”. “Yesterday, we fulfilled a commitment due to which the lives of several Indians will be transformed forever!” Modi wrote on Twitter, as various ministers in his government took to social media to congratulate him. Government data showed that all of India’s 597,464 census villages have now been electrified. When Modi took office in 2014, there were some 18,452 villages without electricity. But just because all villages are connected to the grid does not mean all Indians have access to power. The government considers a village electrified if it has basic electrical infrastructure and 10 percent of its households and public places including schools, local administrative offices and health centres have power. Some people, however, said on Twitter their villages had yet to be electrified despite the government’s claim. “No. Not every village yet,” said Twitter user Dilip Gupta, identifying his village in a district of Uttar Pradesh in the north. “Over the course of years my native place has been expecting electricity every year, but it hasn’t arrived yet.” The World Bank said in a report last year that globally 1.06 billion people had no electricity, with India and Nigeria topping the list of most power-deficient countries.

2018-04-29,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco, the world’s top oil company which is preparing to go public, said on Sunday it has appointed new members to its board including a female executive, a milestone for Saudi Arabia and the oil industry where there are few women executives. The appointments, which bring in more international experience, come as the Saudi government plans to float around 5 percent of Aramco in an initial public offering (IPO) - the world’s largest - later this year or early 2019.  Saudi Arabian Minister of Finance Mohammed al-Jadaan and Minister of Economy and Planning Mohammed al-Tuwaijri were appointed as members of the board of directors, Aramco said in a statement. They are joined by Lynn Laverty Elsenhans, the former chairwoman, president and CEO of U.S. oil refiner Sunoco Inc. from 2008 to 2012. Other new members also include Peter Cella, former president & CEO of Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. LP, and Andrew Liveris, director of DowDuPont Inc, and the CEO of the Dow Chemical Company. Liveris’s appointment is effective as of July 1, Aramco said. The five new members of Aramco’s board will join six returning members including Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, who is also Aramco’s chairman, and Amin Nasser, Aramco’s CEO. Minister of State Ibrahim al-Assaf and Managing Director of the government-owned Public Investment Fund (PIF) Yasir al-Rumayyan also remain on the board.  The outgoing board members are Majid Al-Moneef, advisor to the Saudi Royal Court; Khaled al-Sultan, Rector of King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals; and Peter Woicke, former managing director of the World Bank and former vice president of the International Finance Corporation. Appointment decisions to the new 11-member board of directors are made by the Saudi government.       Elsenhans was named by Forbes as one of the world’s most powerful women in 2008. Prior to her role at Sunoco, Elsenhans was the executive vice president of global manufacturing for Royal Dutch Shell, where she worked for more than 28 years. She also served on Baker Hughes’s board of directors from 2012 to July 2017 and sits on the board of GlaxoSmithKline. Only a handful of Saudi women are appointed to the board of major Saudi companies but that is slowly changing in the conservative kingdom, where women are subject to a male guardianship system which in many cases restricts their opportunities to work.  Last year, the Saudi Stock Exchange appointed Sarah Al-Suhaimi, as its first female chair. She was the first woman to chair a major government financial institution in the kingdom.  In 2004, Lubna Olayan became the first woman to be elected to the board of Saudi Hollandi Bank, now called Alawwal Bank.

2018-04-29,"LONDON, April 29 (Reuters) - Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure to introduce legislation guaranteeing promises made to long-term residents from the Caribbean who have being incorrectly labelled illegal immigrants. For almost two weeks, British ministers have been struggling to explain why some descendants of the so-called “Windrush generation”, invited to Britain to plug labour shortfalls between 1948 and 1971, are being denied basic rights because of trouble documenting their status. The Windrush scandal overshadowed the Commonwealth summit in London earlier this month and has raised questions about May’s six-year stint as interior minister before she became prime minister in the wake of the 2016 Brexit referendum. The government has apologised for the fiasco, promised citizenship and compensation to those affected, including to people who have lost their jobs, been threatened with deportation and denied benefits because of the errors. But more than 200 mainly opposition members of parliament have written to the prime minister calling for the pledges to be written into law “without delay”. The letter accuses the interior minister Amber Rudd, who has faced calls to resign over her handling of the scandal, of making up policy “on the hoof” to defuse the situation. Rudd is due to address parliament on Monday after giving contradictory statements about whether the government has immigration removal targets. In a separate letter, the shadow interior minister Diane Abbott has called for a full inquiry into whether the interior minister misled parliament and breached the ministerial code. Abbott said Rudd’s explanations as to why she had told members of parliament there were no such targets, when in fact there were, “stretch credulity to the limit”. But May’s office said there is no need for an investigation because ministerial code only requires a resignation if a minister knowingly misleads parliament - a charge the interior minister denies.

2018-04-29,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s Great Barrier Reef will receive A$500 million ($379.10 million) in new funding to restore water quality and protect the coral from starfish attacks, government ministers announced on Sunday. Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said in a televised interview that some of the money would go directly to farmers to modify their practices “to ensure that the reef doesn’t get the large amounts of sediment, nitrogen and pesticide run-off which is so damaging to coral and which helps breed this crown-of-thorns starfish.” The Great Barrier Reef, which can be seen from space, covers 348,000 square kilometers and was world-heritage listed in 1981 as the most spectacular coral reef on the planet, according to the website of the United Nations cultural body UNESCO. UNESCO considered putting it on the “in danger” list last year due to recent widespread destruction but voted against it, allowing Australia’s conservative government to dodge political embarrassment and potential damage to the country’s tourism industry. A major outbreak of coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish has been destroying areas of the world heritage-listed reef, prompting a major cull in January. The predator starfish feeds on corals by spreading its stomach over them and using digestive enzymes to liquefy tissue. Agricultural run-off from sugar cane farms and cattle stations has also harmed the section of reef that is closest to shore, according to Bradley Opdike, a marine scientist at the Australian National University. “What happens with the sediment is it just smothers it, while higher nutrients cause algae to out-compete the corals,” he told Reuters by telephone on Sunday. While the funding announcement was welcomed by scientists, some were skeptical on whether it would actually help. Jon Brodie, a professor at James Cook University’s Coral Reef Studies Centre of Excellence said the funding was an extension of existing failed programs. “It’s not working, it’s not achieving major water quality improvements,” he told Reuters by telephone on Sunday. However, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said that Australia was a world leader in managing and protecting its reef, as the government’s Reef 2050 plan had been approved by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee as being the standard for the rest of the world to follow. “They look to Australia to provide the technical expertise the scientific research, and to give the best practice management of coral reefs and that’s what we demonstrate,” she told reporters on Sunday from Cairns on Australia’s east coast.
