2019-02-03,"LONDON (Reuters) - Carmaker Nissan has scrapped plans to build its new X-Trail SUV in Britain and will produce it solely in Japan, warning two months before Brexit that uncertainty over Britain’s departure was making it harder to plan for the future. Falling demand for diesel cars in Europe has forced Nissan to invest in other technologies and save costs. It cut hundreds of jobs at its Sunderland factory in the north of England, Britain’s biggest car plant, last year as output slumped 11 percent, hit by levies and crackdowns on diesel.  “Nissan has increased its investments in new powertrains and technology for its future European vehicles,” the firm said. “Therefore the company has decided to optimise its investments in Europe by consolidating X-Trail production in Kyushu.” “While we have taken this decision for business reasons, the continued uncertainty around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future,” said Nissan Europe Chairman Gianluca de Ficchy. Britain’s business minister Greg Clark said the announcement was a “blow to the sector and the region.”  Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29. Lawmakers last month rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal, heightening fears of a disorderly no-deal Brexit and of new trade barriers. May said on Sunday she would seek a “pragmatic solution”. In a letter to workers, de Ficchy said Nissan has a task force that reports to him and is “considering all of the possible scenarios and the potential impact on the business.” Nissan (7201.T) builds roughly 30 percent of the country’s 1.52 million cars and exports the vast majority to the continent It said four months after Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016 that it would manufacture the new X-Trail in Britain - a major vote of confidence in the country and May, shortly after she took office.  A source told Reuters at the time that Nissan received a letter from the government promising extra support in the event that Brexit hit the competitiveness of the Sunderland plant.  According to the Sunday Times newspaper, ministers are now considering whether to withdraw a 60 million pounds ($78.46 million) package of support for the company. “This kind of support package to help in areas such as training and skills is typical across the industry. Clearly we will be reviewing it in the light of this decision,” a government source told the newspaper.  The new X-Trail could have created hundreds of jobs. The carmaker’s planned investment in the next-generation Juke and Qashqai models, which was also announced in 2016, was unaffected, Nissan said on Sunday.  The announcement came just two days after an EU-Japan free trade agreement kicked in, which includes the European Union’s commitment to removing tariffs of 10 percent on imported Japanese cars. Many Japanese companies had long seen Britain as the gateway to Europe, after being encouraged to open factories in the country by former prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Brexit has thrown that into doubt, prompting consternation in Tokyo.  Sunday’s announcement also came as the carmaker continues to deal with the fallout from the arrest of its former boss Carlos Ghosn, which has clouded the outlook for the automaking alliance between Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi.

2019-02-03,"VIENNA, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Austria will acknowledge Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president if Nicolas Maduro does not respond to the European Union’s call for a free and fair presidential election, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said on Twitter. President Maduro proposed an early parliamentary election on Saturday, seeking to shore up his crumbling rule after a senior general defected to the opposition and tens of thousands thronged the streets in protest at his government. Kurz’s message on Sunday echoed a statement by France’s European Affairs Minister Nathalie Loiseau, who dismissed Maduro’s election proposal as a “farce”. “I just had a very good phone call with President @jguaido,” Kurz tweeted. “He has our full support to restore democracy in Venezuela.” Venezuelans had suffered too long from mismanagement and a disregard for the rule of law under Maduro, he said.

2019-02-03,"PRAGUE, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The Czech Republic is unlikely to be ready to hold a tender to build new nuclear reactors this year, given the financing structure has still not been decided, Industry Minister Marta Novakova said on Sunday. The government and electricity producer CEZ, which is 70 percent owned by the state, have been locked in a debate over how to finance the construction of new nuclear units. “If we take into consideration, what lies ahead of us, then I personally think that it is not entirely realistic this year, that means to have the tender launched,” Novakova said at a debate aired by public Czech Television. “The question of state support will be quite significant. It will have to be part of the tender,” she said. Builders for nuclear power plants from countries including Russia, China and the United States are all set to vie for the Czech deal.

2019-02-03,"PARIS (Reuters) - France’s Europe affairs minister said on Sunday the bloc’s competition rules were absurd and needed to be overhauled, citing the difficulties Alstom (ALSO.PA) and Siemens SIEDn.DE are facing over their planned rail business merger.  “I’m not criticizing the (European) Commission for applying the rules ... But these rules are absurd and were set up in the 20th century and we’re in 2019,” Nathalie Loiseau told LCI television. The European Commission is set this week to block the tie-up, a deal which Loiseau has said is necessary to let them compete against a much bigger Chinese rival. Loiseau said Paris was still trying to convince the commission why the merger was needed to be more competitive against large international rail groups.
