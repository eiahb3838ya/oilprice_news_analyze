2018-09-30,"(Corrects typographical error in paragraph 7) Sept 30 (Reuters) - Canadian oil and gas producer Husky Energy Inc said on Sunday it has made an unsolicited bid to acquire rival MEG Energy Corp in a deal valued at C$6.4 billion ($5 billion) including debt. The combined company would have total production of more than 410,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) and refining and upgrading capacity of about 400,000 barrels per day (bpd), Husky said in a statement. The offer comes as many Canadian oil producers have struggled with transportation bottlenecks as output has surged, pushing Canadian heavy crude to near-historic discounts to U.S. light crude. Husky Chief Executive Rob Peabody told Reuters that the combination of MEG’s top-quality assets and staff with its own production and downstream network would allow MEG to circumvent some of the effects from the Canadian crude discount, and provide benefits for both sets of shareholders. The Husky offer comes less than two months into the tenure of Derek Evans, an industry veteran who took over as chief executive of MEG in August. “We acknowledge that we have received an unsolicited offer from Husky,” John Rogers, vice president of investor relations and external communications at MEG, said in a statement. “The management and board will be reviewing the offer in due course and make a determination if it is in the best interest of shareholders.” Under the terms of the proposal, each MEG shareholder will have the option to choose to receive consideration of C$11 in cash or 0.485 of a Husky share for every share held. That offer is subject to a maximum aggregate cash consideration of C$1 billion and a maximum aggregate number of Husky shares issued of about 107 million. “The MEG Board of Directors has refused to engage in a discussion on the merits of a transaction, giving us no option but to bring this offer directly to MEG shareholders,” Peabody said in the statement. Husky’s offer delivers a 44 percent premium to the 10-day volume-weighted average MEG share price of C$7.62 as of Friday, and a 37 percent premium to MEG’s Friday close of C$8.03. Goldman Sachs Canada Inc is acting as financial adviser and Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP is acting as lead legal adviser to Husky. The proposal, which has been unanimously approved by Husky’s board of directors, is expected to result in C$200 million per year in near-term, realizable synergies.

2018-09-30,"ERBIL/SULAIMANIYA, Iraq (Reuters) - One of the dominant Kurdish parties in northern Iraq said it would not recognise the results of Sunday’s parliamentary election, injecting political uncertainty into a region still demoralised by a failed independence bid. The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) said its decision to ignore the results, which have yet to be announced, was based on what it described as fraud in the voting process.  The PUK is competing with its long-time rival the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) in the election as discontent grows with perceived corruption and economic hardship. With a weak opposition, the political dynasties were expected to extend their power-sharing arrangement in the land of six million people, which gained semi-autonomous status after the 1991 Gulf War. Veteran KDP leader Masoud Barzani has managed to retain a support base even though he led an independence bid that brought humilition and hardship for the Kurds after military and economic retaliation from Baghdad. Splits within the PUK could give the KDP an upper hand in their power-sharing arrangement, which has been fraught with tensions.  While criticism of the ruling Kurdish establishment  -  dominated for decades by the Barzani and the Talabani families - has grown more vocal, a weak opposition means many voters may stick to traditional leaders.    “I don’t know who I will vote for, but our family has always supported the KDP. My son will pick a candidate for me,” said Halima Ahmed, 65, as she walked with a cane in the city of Erbil, the seat of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Preliminary results are expected within 72 hours. There are 111 seats being contested in the election, including 11 reserved for ethnic minorities.  At midday the Independent High Elections and Referendum Commission said turnout was 16-23 percent in a breakdown of provinces. At the Chenar School for Girls polling centre, turnout by 1500 local time (1200 GMT) was less than 35 percent, said poll worker Shaaban Kazem. “The participation rate is very weak, said lawyer and independent observer Belnd Omar. The number of voters has shrunk in recent elections as the region’s stagnant politics, unpaid public sector salaries and corruption have undermined the population’s faith in politics. Observers from two opposition parties said that some people tried to use fake identification to vote but were stopped, though this could not be verified independently by Reuters. Kurdish opposition parties did poorly when Iraq held federal elections in May. But multiple allegations that the KDP and PUK had committed election fraud  - not confirmed in a subsequent recount - may sway some voters in their favour.   Gorran, the main opposition movement, has been weakened by infighting and the death of its founder and leader Nechirvan Mustafa last year.    “I wanted to make sure I voted early. I gave my vote to Gorran and hope for the best,” said Omar Mahmoud Abdullah, 52, at a polling station set up at Shireen School in Sulaimaniya, stronghold of the PUK. At another polling station in Sulaimaniya, lawyer Hassan Dalloush, 65, also said he was voting for the opposition.  “If there’s no fraud in this election, I’ll feel good about it. But the parties in power always want to commit fraud, it’s the only way they stay in power,” he said. “I will never vote for the parties in power. Today I voted for the opposition.”       Reporting by Raya Jalabi in Suleimaniya and Ahmed Aboulenein in Erbil; Writing by Michael Georgy; Editing by David Goodman",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iraq-kurds/update-7-main-iraqi-kurdish-party-says-it-may-reject-regional-election-result-idUKL8N1WG02A,30 Sep 2018,"* Opposition weak, low turnout expected

2018-09-30,"ABUJA (Reuters) - A Nigerian umbrella trade union suspended a nationwide strike on its fourth day on Sunday, after the government agreed to hold a meeting to discuss increasing the minimum wage, a union official said. “The general strike has been suspended, not called off,” said Chris Uyot, deputy secretary general of the Nigerian Labour Congress.  A meeting with the government will be held on Oct. 4-5, the union said in a letter to members. Unions want the monthly minimum wage raised to about 50,000 naira ($164) from 18,000 naira. The strike began on Thursday after talks between President Muhammadu Buhari’s government and unions had broken down. In the letter, the NLC said the meeting was as a result of “united and sustained action”, adding that the suspension was part of an attempt to provide a “conducive atmosphere” for the talks to reach a satisfactory conclusion. “Unions and state councils are requested to maintain a high level of vigilance and mobilization until the struggle for a reasonable minimum wage is successfully concluded,” the letter stated.  Evidence suggested patchy adherence to the strike, and its impact on the economy has been difficult to calculate. President Buhari had promised to review the minimum wage after a fuel price hike and currency devaluation in the last two years. Those were aimed at countering the effects of a global oil price plunge on Nigeria. Buhari’s handling of the economy and the cost of living since he took office in 2015 has become a campaign issue in the build up to the country’s presidential election which is scheduled to take place in February 2019. Nigeria’s ruling All Progressives Congress party on Saturday nominated Buhari as its candidate to stand for re-election in next year’s poll after he ran unopposed in a nationwide primary to select a candidate. The main opposition People’s Democratic Party has not yet selected a candidate.

The Saudi index closed at 7,999.5 points, the highest level since August 29, with petrochemicals giant Saudi Basic Industries closing 1.5 percent higher and refiner Petro Rabigh  up 2.6 percent.

In the third quarter, Brent has gained about 4 percent. “The market was attractive at lower levels with forward PE around 14 times, oil is above $80 now and news on the economy is positive with the government saying they are looking at increasing spending over the next few years,” said Muhammad Faisal Potrik, head of research at Riyad Capital. Saudi Arabia’s government aims to increase spending by over 7 percent next year in an effort to boost sluggish economic growth, while continuing to cut its budget deficit gradually, finance ministry figures released on Sunday showed. A gain of more than 2.2 percent in Industries Qatar lifted Qatari stocks by 0.3 percent. Stocks in oil producing countries are showing strong momentum with oil prices at a four-year high, as U.S. sanctions on Tehran squeezed Iranian crude exports. Kuwait and Russian stocks have also shown sharp gains in the last quarter. The Kuwait index, was flat on Sunday, is up nearly 9 percent this quarter. The Dubai index gained 0.3 percent, helped by a 2.6 percent rise in contractor Arabtec which has been riding high since announcing a 3.2 billion dirham ($871 million) contract earlier this month, won by a consortium involving one of its units. Property firm DAMAC also climbed 2.5 percent ahead of a property show this week where it is expected to showcase new offerings. Abu Dhabi’s index was down 0.3 percent due to weakness in First Abu Dhabi Bank, but Bank of Sharjah closed 1.9 percent higher on merger talk.

2018-09-30,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman is expected to discuss the resumption of oil output from the Neutral Zone, which the kingdom’s shares with Kuwait, during a trip to the Gulf Arab state on Sunday, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Prince Mohammad will be accompanied by Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih during his trip to Kuwait, two separate sources said. The Saudi crown prince will hold talks with Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti News Agency has reported.  The closure of the Neutral Zone’s jointly operated oilfields, mainly Khafji and Wafra, has become a political sticking point between the two Gulf OPEC allies and senior officials have been trying to resolve the issue for months. It was not clear whether the renewed talks on the Neutral Zone would result in the resumption of oil production from the area, one of the sources said. The Saudi government media office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Khafji was shut in October 2014 for environmental reasons and Wafra has been shut since May 2015 due to operating difficulties. Any restart would come at a sensitive time for the oil markets as Washington presses Riyadh to increase oil production to bring crude prices down. Oil prices rose more than 1 percent on Friday, with Brent climbing to a four-year high, as U.S. sanctions on Tehran squeezed Iranian crude exports, tightening supply even as other key exporters increased production. [O/R] U.S. President Donald Trump called Saudi Arabia’s King Salman on Saturday and they discussed efforts being made to maintain supplies to ensure oil market stability and global economic growth, Saudi state news agency SPA reported. The call comes days after the U.S. president called again on OPEC to boost crude output to cool the market ahead of midterm elections in November for U.S. Congress members. Saudi Arabia is the world’s top oil exporter and OPEC’s de-facto leader. The kingdom, the only country with a significant spare capacity, is worried about the tight ability of other producers to raise output amid declining Iranian supplies. The resumption of the Neutral Zone’s oilfields could add up to 500,000 barrels per day of oil output capacity to both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
