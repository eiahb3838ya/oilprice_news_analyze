2018-05-10,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - By restoring sanctions against Iran, U.S. President Donald Trump has tasked a little-known State Department office with convincing companies and governments worldwide to cut imports of Iranian crude - even if that means paying more to buy oil from other suppliers. The Bureau of Energy Resources got the job done during the Iran sanctions that spanned 2012 to 2015, when President Barack Obama had the cooperation of European leaders in choking off Iran’s main revenue source to pressure it to curb its nuclear program. This time around, the office faces steeper challenges: Europe’s leaders now oppose Trump’s aggressive stance on Iran and are considering ways to block the sanctions; the U.S. Senate has yet to confirm a leader for the bureau; and the State Department already has its hands full managing sanctions on Venezuela, trade disputes with China, and looming talks with North Korea. “It’s going to be a lot harder this time,” said Amos Hochstein, who led the bureau under President Obama, when diplomats from the United States, Iran, China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and Germany formed the 2015 nuclear deal. “There’s going to be a lot less good will.”  Under Trump’s renewed sanctions, foreign firms will have 180 days to make reductions or face penalties that can include fines and restrictions on doing business in the United States. Washington can identify the buyers, sellers, traders, shippers, insurers and financial institutions involved in Iranian oil purchases because all foreign transactions in U.S. dollars are cleared by the Federal Reserve. The work is harder if trades are done in other currencies. The United States has banned Iranian oil imports to its own shores for decades, so Washington’s ability to squeeze the exports will rely on convincing foreign governments and companies to pressure the Islamic Republic back to the negotiating table for a “better deal” - as Trump has said he expects. Officials at the Department of Treasury, the Department of Commerce and the White House did not respond to a request for comment on the difficulty in managing oil curbs on Iran. When asked about the challenges, energy bureau spokesman Vincent Campos said the office “will carry out sanctions policy in the current environment.” If successful, sanctions would slash exports from one of the top suppliers in the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and likely raise prices for crude globally by forcing buyers to compete for alternative supplies. U.S. oil prices have already vaulted over $70 a barrel to highs not seen since 2014. [O/R] Under Obama and Hochstein, Iran’s exports of oil plummeted from about 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) to less than 1.3 million bpd, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Imposing those cuts was difficult, even with more geopolitical backing. Teams from the bureau joined with colleagues from the Departments of Treasury and Commerce to visit governments in Asia and the Middle East, cajoling them into finding alternatives to Iranian oil, and to help battle smuggling. The European Union joined the United States and passed its own Iran sanctions in 2012, cutting its imports of Iranian oil from 650,000 bpd to zero. This time, European leaders will be less helpful. They have urged Trump not to leave the nuclear deal, which they say was hard-won and has proven to be an effective tool preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The European Union, meanwhile, is considering a so-called “blocking statute” that would ban any EU company from complying with the U.S. sanctions. French President Emmanuel Macron warned before Trump’s announcement that if Washington pulls fully out of the deal, it could start a war. The leaders of Germany, England, and Russia have also expressed dismay - and are scrambling to salvage the accord after Washington’s exit. A State Department official told reporters in a briefing Tuesday that no U.S. diplomats had yet engaged with any private sector energy companies about cutting their Iranian purchases but that energy bureau staff would “move out immediately” to do so. Sources with three global trading houses involved in Iranian oil purchases said they expected Iran’s customers to ask for waivers under the U.S. sanctions. Some Asian governments, including South Korea, India and China, are also hoping they can avoid the brunt of the sanctions by acquiring waivers - which the U.S. government has said it will only consider granting if a country shows a good faith effort to cut Iranian purchases. The job facing the bureau on Iran sanctions will require strong leadership and a robust workforce, according to three former State Department officials who worked on sanctions.  But the State Department’s energy bureau is embarking on this difficult work without a permanent leader and with some vacancies in the mid-level ranks from a hiring freeze and transfers.  Trump’s nominee to head the bureau, Francis Fannon - a former head of corporate affairs at BHP Billiton and senior director of Murphy Oil Corp - awaits Senate confirmation. The bureau is currently being managed by acting special envoy, John McCarrick, a former corporate lawyer and energy advisor for Republican John McCain’s unsuccessful 2008 presidential campaign. A State Department inspector general report said in 2016 that 81 people worked full time at the bureau. Campos declined to say how many worked there now, but said the teams managing sanctions on Iran and Venezuela are fully staffed. Bob McNally, former President George W. Bush’s top energy adviser, said the State Department is “fully able” to make the sanctions work but the administration still needs to define its goals. The sanctions imposed under the Obama administration were threatened by smuggling of Iranian oil, by crews shutting off tracking devices on tankers, mixing Iranian oil into tankers of non-Iranian oil and other methods. Energy bureau officials controlled that problem through close coordination with other U.S. agencies, embassies abroad and local law enforcement, the former State Department officials said. The bureau also needs to determine how much it wants companies to reduce Iranian oil imports, which requires deft diplomacy and an analysis of historical buying trends. The previous administration avoided telling countries percentages it wanted them to cut and allowed some countries to buy more than others, but countries ended up cutting purchases about 18 to 20 percent. “There is a lot more that goes on in the everyday grunt work than, bluntly, I think this administration understands,” Richard Nephew, who served as the lead sanctions expert for the team that negotiated the Obama administration’s 2015 deal with Iran, said in an interview. Another key priority will be to set a clear requirement for the lifting of sanctions. In 2012, the sanctions were designed to end once Iran agreed to specific limits on its nuclear program. This time there’s less clarity, Hochstein said.  “Countries never want to be told what to do with their economy,” said Hochstein. “At least before it was toward a specific end. Now it’s open ended.” Trump said on Wednesday that Iran would now either negotiate to alter the 2015 deal, or “something will happen.” (This story corrects “Trump’s” to “Trump” in lead paragraph, corrects spelling of John McCarrick’s name in paragraph 21.)

2018-05-10,"LONDON (Reuters) - Equatorial Guinea is in talks to sell liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply from its Punta Europa project to independent and state-backed oil companies and traders from 2020 as it winds down an exclusive deal with Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L). Gabriel Obiang Lima, Minister for Mines and Hydrocarbons, told Reuters he is seeking to lift royalties from future LNG deals close to 50 percent, compared with 12.5 percent under existing arrangements with Shell. Shell’s deal, inherited after it acquired BG Group in 2015, was amended in 2009 under government pressure to include a 12.5 percent share of profits, but it is still among the most lucrative contracts for any LNG exporter. “We invited possible LNG buyers, so they are aware of the opportunities,” Lima said, adding that talks are progressing with China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC)(0883.HK), Russia’s Lukoil (LKOH.MM), France’s Total (TOTF.PA), trader Vitol, Shell and a joint venture between Lukoil and NewAge. Supply deals will be offered for 3-5 years from 2020, Lima said. Equatorial Guinea’s LNG plant, operated by Marathon Oil Corporation, is currently fed by the depleting Alba gas field, which faces a cliff-edge dip in output from 2019/2020, he said. Future production will be underpinned by pooling supply from stranded gas fields in Equatorial Guinea and the wider region, raising the prospect of eventually boosting LNG output and state energy revenue.  Lima’s sales pitch shows how producers from fully paid-up projects can afford to release supply to unconventional buyers, such as trade houses, under short tenors, stimulating global LNG market liquidity. Brunei, Qatar, Malaysia, Algeria and Nigeria all have long-term LNG contracts expiring in coming years. In signing up to buy all of Equatorial Guinea’s 3.4 million tonnes of annual LNG output for 17 years, BG Group - later acquired by Shell - sealed one of the industry’s most lucrative LNG deals. It paid a fixed discount to U.S. Henry Hub gas prices - now one of the cheapest gas benchmarks in the world - as it initially planned to sell supply into that market.  As the shale gas revolution killed demand for LNG imports, BG Group benefited from paying U.S.-linked prices for the LNG as it diverted supply to Asia, where prices were up to five times higher. The original contract made no provision for profit sharing on cargo diversions with the government, highlighting how America’s transformation from gas importer to exporter blindsided LNG players.  Alba gas field reserves of three trillion cubic feet for LNG only provided for the first 12.5 years of the plant’s output, leaving the later part of BG’s 17-year off-take contract uncovered.   This may have allowed the government to exit the deal early in 2020, an industry source said.  But new gas supplies are being lined up. In a statement on Thursday, Noble Energy announced a pact with Equatorial Guinea to make available 600-billion-cubic-feet of gas from its offshore Alen field for the LNG plant. The proposal envisages a platform and 65-kilometre pipeline (40 miles) to Punta Europa big enough to carry gas from other nearby fields, in a concession to Lima’s vision for Equatorial Guinea to be a regional gas export hub. A parallel statement by LNG plant operator Marathon said it would open the facility to third-party gas suppliers.

2018-05-10,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar and U.S. government debt yields fell on Thursday while equity markets rallied after a modest rise in consumer prices in April eased concerns the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates more than expected this year. The U.S. Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent last month, less than forecasts for 0.3 percent, as a moderation in healthcare prices offset increases in the cost of gasoline and rental accommodations. [L1N1SG1UT] The dollar fell against the euro, the Japanese yen and a basket of other major currencies, while the Mexican peso and Brazilian real jumped more than 1 percent on the news. Equity markets rose as the soft inflation data reduced the prospect of the Fed boosting rates three more times in 2018, instead of four that many in the market were forecasting.  Apple hit a record high at $190.37, with all 11 major S&P sectors posting gains. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 8/32 in price to push yields down to 2.964 percent after breaching 3 percent on Wednesday. “Inflation is going to rise in year-over-year terms over the summer, but the rise remains moderate rather than sharp,” said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein LP.  The soft read on inflation should give the Fed comfort that their gradual approach to raising rates is the correct one and ease market concerns, he said. “I view today’s number as a slight positive for risk assets in the near term,” Winograd said. However, the broad-based Underlying Inflation Gauge released by staff at the New York Fed later in the session showed 12-month inflation at 3.2 percent in April. “We did have a miss on CPI for this particular month, but I don’t think the overall trend for higher inflation has materially changed,” said Eddy Vataru, a portfolio manager at Osterweis Capital Management in San Francisco. “With oil prices north of $70, it’s hard for me to believe this is going to be a persistent trend of inflation misses,” he said. MSCI’s broad gauge of global equity markets rose 0.84 percent and turned positive for the year as it hit three-weeks highs.  Apple,  Chinese internet giant Tencent, Exxon Mobil and Microsoft led the index’s advance, while the same stocks lifted Wall Street, with the exception of Tencent.  Emerging market stocks rose 1.41 percent, after Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan and the Nikkei in Tokyo both earlier closed higher.  The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed down 0.13 percent, but markets in London, Germany and France closed higher. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 196.99 points, or 0.8 percent, to 24,739.53. The S&P 500 gained 25.28 points, or 0.94 percent, to 2,723.07 and the Nasdaq Composite added 65.07 points, or 0.89 percent, to 7,404.98. The British pound hit a four-month low versus the greenback after the Bank of England left key borrowing costs unchanged. The recent softening in price growth among major economies has reduced expectations that most central banks other than the Fed will reduce their bond purchases or raise interest rates. The dollar index fell 0.39 percent, with the euro up 0.61 percent to $1.1922. The Japanese yen JPY+ firmed 0.31 percent versus the greenback at 109.43 per dollar.  Oil markets were choppy but settled higher as traders eyed  further declines in Venezuelan crude production in tandem with bullish drawdowns in U.S. crude inventories. Brent crude futures rose 26 cents to settle at $77.47 a barrel, after hitting $78 earlier in the day, their highest since November 2014. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures settled up 22 cents at $71.36.  Gold rose on the weaker dollar and as tensions between the United States and Iran also supported the precious metal.

2018-05-10,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude prices ended the session slightly higher on Thursday as investors weighed the potential disruption to oil flows from major exporter Iran in the face of U.S. sanctions. The market also contended with concerns about Venezuela’s crude production slipping further and with bullish drawdowns in U.S. crude inventories. Crude traded up to 3-1/2 year highs early in the session, and then retreated after a bearish inventory figure from energy industry information supplier Genscape, before rallying on geopolitical risks just before the settlement, traders said.  Brent crude futures settled 26 cents, or 0.3 percent, higher at $77.47 a barrel, after earlier hitting $78, the highest since November 2014. U.S. West Texas Intermediate settled up 22 cents at $71.36.  “It’s not going to take that much in this environment to create a disruption, and people are going to be very nervous to be short,” said Phil Flynn, senior energy analyst at Price Futures Group. “There’s not a lot of room for error.” Traders exited positions late in the day, being afraid of being caught short, said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors. “I think we’re supported on prices until there’s more clarity.” The United States said on Tuesday that it plans to impose new sanctions against Iran after abandoning an agreement reached in late 2015 that curbed Tehran’s nuclear activities in exchange for removal of U.S. and European sanctions. Brent crude could return to $100 a barrel next year, or even sooner, Bank of America said, due to the ongoing collapse of Venezuelan output and risks to Iranian crude exports. The bank also lifted its average Brent forecast to $70 for this year and $75 in 2019.  Oil prices are on track for their fourth consecutive quarterly gain, the longest such stretch for more than 10 years, boosted largely in the past month by fears of disruption in   supplies from Iran, which pumps about 4 percent of the world’s oil and exports about 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) to Europe and around 1.8 million bpd to Asia. Sales to Europe are seen by analysts as the more likely to be reduced by the sanctions. Analysts had little hope that opposition to the U.S. action would prevent sanctions from going ahead. European allies have said they remain committed to maintaining the nuclear deal, with German Chancellor Merkel reiterating her support of the accord Thursday. “Europe and China will not fight against the U.S. sanctions. They will grumble and accept it. There is no one who will realistically choose Iran over the U.S.,” said energy consultancy FGE. “We believe the previous 1 million-bpd limit for exports (imposed during previous sanctions) will be reimposed. As before, it may take several rounds of reductions to reach target levels,” FGE’s founder and chairman Fereidun Fesharaki wrote in a note. Even without disruption to Iran’s crude flows, the balance between supply and demand in the oil market has been tightening steadily, especially in Asia, with top exporter Saudi Arabia and No.1 producer Russia having led efforts since 2017 to cap output to prop up prices. Saudi Arabia is ready to offset any supply shortage but it will not act alone to fill the gap, an OPEC source familiar with the kingdom’s oil thinking said on Wednesday. The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, however, is in no hurry to decide whether to pump more oil to make up for an expected drop in exports from Iran, four sources familiar with the issue said, saying any loss in supply would take time. “What the full impact on Iranian flows will be is still difficult to estimate,” said Petromatrix strategist Olivier Jakob. “One thing that has changed and which I think is clearly a new development is that it seems to me that the White House administration has really pushed Saudi Arabia to do something about price and to put supply back into the market to make sure prices do not run up ... before (when sanctions were last in place) Saudi Arabia was driving its own oil policy.”         One factor that could partially mitigate any shortfall from Iran is soaring U.S. oil output. The EIA on Tuesday raised its forecast for U.S. output in its monthly report to 12 million bpd late next year. The agency has raised its forecasts every month since last August. [EIA/M]  This would make the United States the world’s largest producer, ahead of both Russia and Saudi Arabia.

2018-05-10,"(Adds Conoco response, context) By Alexandra Ulmer and Deisy Buitrago CARACAS, May 10 (Reuters) - Venezuela on Thursday rejected ConocoPhillips’s moves to seize the country’s Caribbean assets to collect on a $2 billion arbitration award, but in a sign the U.S. oil company’s pressure might be working, Caracas also suggested it was ready to pay. In its first official comments since Reuters revealed Conoco’s actions over the weekend, Venezuela’s cash-squeezed leftist government said PDVSA wanted to solve the dispute through legal means. The dispute stems from Venezuela’s nationalization of Conoco’s assets a decade ago under late leader Hugo Chavez. PDVSA “is committed to honoring the decisions stemming from the arbitration award,” the Oil Ministry said in a series of tweets. The tweets disappeared about an hour later. Venezuela’s Oil Ministry and PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment. Conoco is looking forward to PDVSA’s proposals to resolve this matter, said Janet Langford Carrig, ConocoPhillips’ senior vice president, general counsel and corporate secretary in an email. “But absent any agreement and payment of the ICC award we will continue our enforcement actions.” Venezuela would be hard pressed to cough up $2 billion as it faces a brutal recession, hefty debt payments to bondholders and an upcoming presidential election. Nicolas Maduro’s leftist administration is also battling more than a dozen other arbitration cases triggered by a wave of nationalizations under Chavez, who died of cancer in 2013. Venezuela has requested annulments or shown little willingness to pay recent awards, leading creditors to pursue its overseas assets as a form of payment. In the most aggressive move to date, ConocoPhillips last week moved to temporarily seize PDVSA’s assets on Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao and St. Eustatius. That threw Venezuela’s oil export chain into a tailspin just as Venezuela’s crude production has crumbled to an over 30-year low due to underinvestment, theft, a brain drain and mismanagement. PDVSA was forced to suspend oil storage and shipping from its Caribbean facilities and has concentrated most shipping in its main crude terminal of Jose, which is suffering from a backlog. Conoco’s actions may have also spurred action from other creditors who fear ending up at the end of the line. Mining company Rusoro filed a lawsuit seeking to attach assets of PDVSA’s Citgo Petroleum as payment for a $1.2 billion arbitration award. And a firm that received the Venezuelan promissory notes from Canadian contractor SNC-Lavalin on Wednesday sued PDVSA for over $25 million over nonpayment.

2018-05-10,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to quit a multinational nuclear deal would not affect Tehran’s oil exports. “Trump’s decision will not have any impact on our oil export ... that era is history now,” he told state television. Trump announced a U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal on Tuesday and said he was preparing new sanctions against Iran. Zanganeh said foreign investment was needed to develop Iran’s its oil industry, but that it could survive even if foreigners decided to stay away for fear of U.S. penalties.  “If foreigners invest in Iran, it will accelerate the development of our oil sector but, if not, we will not die,” he said. The U.S. Treasury said on Tuesday that the United States  would reimpose a wide array of Iran-related sanctions after the expiry of 90- and 180-day wind-down periods, including sanctions aimed at Iran’s oil sector and transactions with its central bank.   Under the deal reached in 2015 between Iran and six major powers, Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear programme in return for lifting most international sanctions that crippled the country’s economy. Since the sanctions were lifted in 2016, major European companies, partly wary of the remaining U.S. sanctions on Iran, have been reluctant to do business with Tehran, which needs to attract over $100 billion in foreign investment to boost its crude output. New U.S. sanctions will include measures aimed at its oil and shipping sectors, with a six-month “wind down” period “to allow companies to end contracts, terminate business, (and) get their money out”, according to the U.S. State Department. In the wake of new U.S. sanctions, some buyers of OPEC’s third-largest oil producer said on Wednesday they would seek U.S. exemptions to purchase Iranian crude.  Zanganeh said Iran’s crude production was about four million barrels per day (bpd), almost four percent of global output.  “I expect the production to remain the same until the end of this (Iranian) year,” Zanganeh said. The Iranian year ends on March 20.  During the last round of sanctions, Iran’s oil supplies fell by around one million bpd, but the country re-emerged as a major oil exporter after sanctions were lifted by producing 3.81 million bpd in March 2018.  In reaction to a Tweet last month by Trump that accused OPEC of “artificially” boosting oil prices, Zanganeh said “Trump is not honest about oil prices ... He wants higher prices”. Crude prices slipped on Thursday, giving up early gains as investors took profits on a rally triggered by potential disruption to oil flows from Iran. “I personally prefer a stable crude price of $65 per barrel,” Zanganeh said. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and several other producers began to reduce oil output in January 2017 in an attempt to erase a supply glut and prop up prices. They have extended the pact until December 2018, and meet in June to review policy. OPEC, however, is in no hurry to decide whether to pump more oil to make up for an expected drop in exports from Iran, four sources familiar with the issue said, saying any loss in supply would take time.

2018-05-10,"SOLAI, Kenya (Reuters) - A dam on a commercial flower farm in Kenya’s Rift Valley burst after weeks of torrential rain, unleashing a “sea of water” that careered down a hillside and smashed into two villages, killing at least 47 people. The walls of the reservoir, on top of a hill in Nakuru county, 190 km (120 miles) northwest of Nairobi, gave way late on Wednesday as nearby residents were sitting down to evening meals. Kenya is one of the largest suppliers of cut flowers to Europe, and roses from the 3,500-acre Solai farm are exported to the Netherlands and Germany, according to Optimal Connection, its Netherlands-based handling agent. The floodwaters carved out a dark brown chasm in the hillside and swept away everything in their path - powerlines, homes and buildings, including a primary school. The bodies of two women were found several km (miles) away as excavators and rescue workers armed with shovels picked through rubble and mud searching for survivors and victims. Local police chief Japheth Kioko said the death toll could climb. “So far it is 47 dead. We are still on the ground,” he told Reuters. Nakuru governor Lee Kinyanjui said on Twitter that another 40 people were reported missing and a decision had been made to discharge water from another nearby dam as a precaution. After a severe drought last year, East Africa has been hit by two months of heavy rain, affecting nearly a million people in Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia and Uganda. Bridges have been swept away and roads turned into rivers of mud. In Solai, Veronica Wanjiku Ngigi, 67, said she was at home brewing tea with her son at about 8 pm (1700 GMT) when his wife rushed in to say the dam had burst and they needed to get to higher ground immediately. “It was a sea of water. My neighbor was killed when the water smashed through the wall of his house. He was blind, so he could not run. They found his body in the morning,” she said. “My other neighbors also died. All our houses have been ruined.” Nakuru lies in the heart of Kenya’s fertile Rift Valley, home to thousands of commercial farms that grow everything from French beans to macadamia nuts to cut flowers, nearly all of which are exported to Europe. The region is dotted with irrigation reservoirs built in the last two decades to meet the demands of the rapidly expanding agricultural sector, the biggest foreign exchange earner for East Africa’s largest economy and a major source of jobs. Vinoj Kumar, general manager of the Solai farm, blamed the disaster on massive rainfall in a forest above the dam. “In the past two days the intensity of the rain was high and the water started coming down carrying boulders and roots which damaged the wall,” he told Reuters. “The dam wall cracked and the water escaped.” Governor Kinyanjui said 450 homes had been hit by the floodwaters and safety engineers had been sent to inspect three other dams to check for cracks or breaches. Wanjiku, the survivor, said at least one looked like it was ready to burst. “There is another dam which is also overflowing which is looking risky,” she said. “We are scared.” One primary school had been closed as a precaution, education officials said. Arriving at the scene, Interior Minister Fred Matiangi pledged central government assistance to those affected. To date, heavy rains have caused havoc in Kenya, killing at least 158 people and displacing 299,859, according to the government and Kenya Red Cross. Roads and bridges have been destroyed, causing millions of dollars of damage. The U.N. disaster agency UNOCHA said 580,000 people had been affected by torrential rain and flooding in neighboring Somalia, while the Somali region of eastern Ethiopia had also taken a hammering, with 160,000 people affected. The flooding could yet get worse, with heavy rains forecast to continue in the Rift Valley and the Lake Victoria basin over the next few weeks.

2018-05-10,"(Adds LIOC price increase) By Ranga Sirilal COLOMBO, May 10 (Reuters) - State-run Sri Lankan fuel retailer Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) will raise retail prices for gasoline and diesel from midnight on Thursday in repsonse to rising oil prices, a government spokesman said. CPC, which has about two thirds of the country’s retail fuel market, will increase the price of gasoline by 20 rupees to 137 rupees a litre. Diesel rises by 14 rupees to 109 rupees and kerosene oil will rise by 57 rupees to 101 rupees. The move follows that of Lanka IOC, the only other fuel retailer in Sri Lanka, which raised its prices in March. The subsidiary of Indian Oil Corp announced another increase on Thursday, lifting its gasoline price to 137 rupees, on par with the CPC price, and diesel to 111 rupees, higher than the CPC price. Lanka IOC had first raised prices on March 24 after a cumulative loss of 1.3 billion rupees ($8.2 million) in the previous four quarters. CPC had been under pressure to increase its prices after incurring a loss of 9.9 billion rupees ($64 million) in the first two months of the year because of rising oil prices. “After a long discussion, we decided to revise the prices after evaluating the global oil price increase,” Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne told reporters in Colombo, adding that the increase will help to reduce CPC’s losses. Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the cabinet approved the price formula with revisions every two months. The government cut petrol prices in January 2015 after President Maithripala Sirisena was voted into office. It has not increased prices since then, fearing unpopularity among voters. Under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to boost revenue, Sri Lanka’s government increased excise duty on diesel by 10 rupees to 13 rupees per litre from August last year but asked fuel retailers not to pass on the cost to consumers.

2018-05-10,"BONN, Germany (Reuters) - Governments made slow progress on a “rule book” for a global climate accord after two weeks of talks ending on Thursday and agreed to a new round of negotiations to break a diplomatic logjam before a year-end deadline for a deal. Disputes among the senior climate officials from about 180 nations in Bonn included how rich nations will raise finance to a pledged $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing nations cope with rising temperatures and cut their emissions. “We can’t say failure. But overall we’ve been having slow progress,” Gebru Jember Endalew, chair of the group of least developed countries, told Reuters. Poor nations are most vulnerable to more droughts, floods and rising sea levels. Delegates agreed to hold an extra session in Bangkok from September 3-8 before environment ministers meet in Katowice, Poland, in December when the rule book for the Paris pact is due to be agreed. The 2015 Paris Agreement set a sweeping goal of ending the fossil fuel era this century with a trillion-dollar shift toward cleaner energies such as wind or solar power to help limit a rise in temperatures.  But it was vague on the details, such as how to measure financial flows to developing nations and how countries will report and monitor curbs on greenhouse gas emissions and ratchet up national goals every five years to limit global warming. “We have to be very, very clear that we have a lot of work in the months ahead and that we have to improve the pace of progress to achieve a good outcome in Katowice,” Patricia Espinosa, the U.N. climate chief, told a news conference. She said progress had been “satisfactory” in Bonn. Writing the “rule book” - formally known as “implementation guidelines” - is the biggest test of the international commitment to the Paris Agreement since President Donald Trump said in June he will pull out, doubting that climate change has a human cause. Elina Bardram of the European Commission said clear rules on curbing emissions, adapting to climate change and finance were vital in 2018 to bring the Paris agreement to life. But she said some elements were likely to need more time. “We have to accept that not all the nitty gritty details can be agreed by Katowice,” she said. Luke Daunivalu, chief negotiator for Fiji which is presiding at the talks in 2018, also said of the rule book: “How thick or how thin ... is an open question at the moment. It will become a little clearer at Bangkok.” Current national pledges to curb emissions put the world on track for a warming of about 3 degrees Celsius (5.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, far above a Paris goal of “well below” 2C (3.6F).

2018-05-10,"(Updates with price movement, adds analyst quote) By Mark Weinraub WASHINGTON, May 10 (Reuters) - U.S. soybean supplies are seen falling in the upcoming marketing year as domestic usage and exports are expected to remain strong even as production eases, the U.S. Agriculture Department said on Thursday. Domestic corn and wheat stocks are also expected to drop due to smaller harvests, according to the government’s monthly supply and demand report. USDA, in its initial estimate of the 2018/19 marketing year, pegged soybean ending stocks at 415 million bushels, down from its forecast of 530 million bushels for 2017/18. Soybean futures, which had been trading slightly higher throughout the morning, jumped more than 1 percent to session highs after the report was released. Analysts’ forecast for soybean ending stocks had ranged from 400 million to 715 million for 2018/19 and 495 million to 575 million for 2017/18, according to a Reuters survey. “U.S. soybean ending stocks were a big surprise,” said Rich Nelson, chief strategist at Allendale Inc. “They didn’t cut new-crop exports and implied very strong demand likely based on Argentina for the remainder of the new-crop year.” For corn, USDA put ending stocks at 1.682 billion bushels for 2018/19 and 2.182 billion bushels for 2017/18, in line with market forecasts. Wheat ending stocks were seen at 955 million bushels for 2018/19 and 1.070 billion bushels for 2017/18, both of which were above the average of analysts’ estimates. CBOT soft red winter wheat futures, which were trading close to unchanged, sank nearly 2 percent to their lowest since April 30 as the market digested the data. USDA pegged U.S. winter wheat production at 1.192 billion bushels, down 6 percent from a year ago, due to drought in key production states such as Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. Harvested winter wheat acreage was seen falling to a record low of 24.8 million. The government estimated the U.S. soybean harvest for 2018/19 at 4.280 billion bushels, down from 4.392 billion a year earlier. Soybean exports were seen rising to 2.290 billion bushels from 2.065 billion, while the domestic crush was projected to rise by 5 million bushels to 1.995 billion. The U.S. corn harvest was forecast at 14.040 billion bushels in 2018/19, down from 14.604 billion bushels in 2017/18. Exports were seen falling to 2.100 billion bushels from 2.225 billion bushels.

2018-05-10,"PAHOA, Hawaii, May 10 (Reuters) - Hawaii authorities scrambled to move tens of thousands of gallons of highly flammable chemicals from the path of lava on Thursday, and the state’s governor warned mass evacuations might be needed as the Kilauea volcano’s eruption became more violent. After a new fissure opened on Wednesday about half a mile from a geothermal power plant, Hawaii Governor David Ige set up an emergency task force to remove the pentane used in the plant’s turbines. He cited estimates that if the fluid ignites, the resulting explosion could create a blast radius of up to one mile. (1.6 km) The Puna Geothermal Venture plant sits at the edge of the Leilani Estates residential area on Hawaii’s Big Island where lava from 15 volcanic fissures has so far destroyed 36 structures, most of them homes, and forced the evacuation of around 2,000 residents. “As more fissures open and toxic gas exposure increases, the potential of a larger scale evacuation increases,” Ige said in a tweet on Wednesday evening. “A mass evacuation of the lower Puna District would be beyond current county and state capabilities, and would quickly overwhelm our collective resources,” Ige tweeted, saying in a separate post that he signed a request for federal disaster assistance. The lower part of the Puna District, of which Leilani Gardens is a part, covers dozens of square miles and is home to many thousands of residents. It has the highest possible hazard risks for lava flows, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Exposure to very high levels of the sulfur dioxide gas emitted from the fissures can be life-threatening, experts say. Geologists warned on Wednesday that Kilauea may be entering a more violent phase of explosive eruptions, the likes of which Hawaii has not seen in nearly a century. Steam-driven explosive eruptions could hurl “ballistic blocks” weighing several tons upwards of half a mile and dust towns as far away as Hilo, some 25 miles (40 km) distant, with volcanic ash and smog. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, where Kilauea is located, said on Wednesday it would close most of the park on Friday due to the threat of a possible explosive eruption. Magma is draining out of the volcano’s sinking lava pool and flowing underground tens of miles eastward before bursting to the surface on Kilauea’s eastern flank in the lower Puna area. “There’s still quite a fair bit of magma under the ground that’s available to erupt,” Tina Neal, the scientist in charge of the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, said in a conference call, adding that she saw no end to activity in the east rift zone. Kilauea has been in a state of nearly constant eruption for 35 years. It predominantly oozes out lava from fissures that flows into the ocean but occasionally experiences more explosive eruptions, such as an event in 1924.

The debt stems from a 2012 deal that ended a dispute over oil payments between the two nations after South Sudan seceded the previous year. In the deal, South Sudan agreed to pay $3 billion to its northern neighbour. Two years after its secession from Sudan, South Sudan was plunged into civil war, which led to a sharp cut in its oil production that the country is now trying to reverse. The country is currently producing 130,000 barrels per day (bpd) and aims to hit 280,000 bpd later this year. Its peak was 350,000 bpd in 2011. A ramp up this year will come from its Dar Petroleum Operating Co, in which China’s CNPC and Malaysia’s Petronas have major stakes. GPOC, its other venture that has produced oil and whose largest stakeholder is CNPC, has taken initial steps to resume operations in its Unity oilfield. South Sudan’s Nilepet holds an 8 percent stake in GPOC. Gatkuoth said GPOC had hired Hong Kong-listed Frontier Services Group (FSG), which produced a security assessment in March saying it would be safe for GPOC to resume output. FSG is owned by Erik Prince, a former U.S. Navy seal and brother of U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Prince founded a company formerly known as Blackwater that he was forced to sell after some of its guards were convicted of killing 14 unarmed Iraqi civilians. Gatkuoth said several steps remained before GPOC would resume output and that another venture SPOC, led by Petronas, had not yet conducted a similar survey. “The next step (for GPOC) is a technical assessment to see what damage has been done,” the minister said. “The processing facility was destroyed, the control room was destroyed but the pipelines and wellheads are intact. The power lines were destroyed but we got an agreement with Sudan to supply 8 megawatts (MW); the facility needs 18 MW.” The United States ramped up its sanctions on South Sudan in March this year by adding 15 companies operating in the African country’s oil sector to its list. Washington accused the government and officials of using revenues “to purchase weapons and fund irregular militias that undermine the peace, security, and stability of South Sudan.” Gatkuoth said the restrictions had no impact on oil production other than deterring U.S. investment, but added he was in discussions with foreign firms such as Total for stakes in some oilfields. “The machines, rigs ... they all come from China but I want U.S. companies to come back as well,” he said. Land-locked South Sudan sells its crude via pipeline through Sudan. Gatkuoth said Switzerland-based Trafigura, Lebanon’s BB Energy and Nigeria’s Sahara Energy were the three buyers for the country’s crude with cash advances. Trafigura used to be the sole lifter but BB Energy began last year and Sahara will start this month. He said South Sudan was not seeking long-term pre-payments for now.

The U.S. Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent last month, less than forecasts for 0.3 percent, as a moderation in healthcare prices offset increases in the cost of gasoline and rental accommodations. The dollar fell against the euro, the Japanese yen and a basket of other major currencies, while the Mexican peso and Brazilian real jumped about 1 percent on the news. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 8/32 in price to push yields down to 2.964 percent after breaching 3 percent on Wednesday. “Inflation is going to rise in year-over-year terms over the summer, but the rise remains moderate rather than sharp,” said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein LP. The soft read on inflation should give the Fed comfort that their gradual approach to raising rates is the correct one and ease market concerns, he said. “I view today’s number as a slight positive for risk assets in the near term,” Winograd said. MSCI’s broad gauge of global equity markets rose 0.51 percent and turned positive for the year as it hit three-weeks highs. Chinese internet giant Tencent, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook led the index’s advance, while the U.S. technology sector lifted Wall Street. Emerging market stocks rose 1.26 percent, while Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan and the Nikkei in Tokyo both earlier closed higher. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares fell 0.25 percent, but shares in London, Germany and France were higher. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 154.43 points, or 0.63 percent, to 24,696.97. The S&P 500 gained 15.07 points, or 0.56 percent, to 2,712.86 and the Nasdaq Composite added 45.80 points, or 0.62 percent, to 7,385.70. Oil prices were in flux and gave up earlier gains as investors took profit on a rally triggered by the potential disruption to crude flows from major exporter Iran in the face of U.S. sanctions. The United States said on Tuesday it plans to impose new sanctions against Iran after abandoning an agreement reached in late 2015 that curbed Tehran’s nuclear activities in exchange for removal of U.S. and European sanctions. Brent crude futures were down 0.08 percent at $77.13 a barrel, after hitting $78 earlier in the day, their highest since November 2014.

2018-05-10,"* India scraps import duty on solar modules * Sudden change in tax policy last year led to logjams at ports * Indian component makers have struggled to compete with Chinese firms By Sudarshan Varadhan NEW DELHI, May 10 (Reuters) - India has scrapped a duty on solar modules, making it easier to import the products after a sudden change in customs policy last year led to a logjam of shipments at Indian ports. Several consignments of solar modules, worth more than $150 million in total, were held up for more than three months at ports after Indian customs’ officials in August demanded that some of them be classified as “electric motors and generators”, carrying a 7.5 percent import duty. Previously they were subject to no duty. The finance ministry reversed the policy last month, stating in a notice seen by Reuters that most solar modules should revert to their original classification and that no tax should be levied on them. Indian component makers have struggled to compete with Chinese companies such as Trina Solar and Yingli and have sought anti-dumping duties as well as long-term safeguards. But the logjam of shipments at ports posed a headache for solar power producers and threatened to delay Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s plan of nearly tripling the country’s total renewable energy capacity to 175 gigawatt (GW) by 2022. The plan has spurred foreign investment in the sector, with Japan’s SoftBank and Goldman Sachs among others investing in solar projects in India. Any duty is bad news for solar power producers such as SoftBank-backed SB Energy but good for local solar component makers such as Indosolar and Moser Baer. The change in policy last August led to logjams as it was not immediately clear which modules belonged to the new classification. To ease the situation customs officials agreed to release shipments if importers paid a bank guarantee to cover any duty they may be required to pay. An executive at the Indian unit of Germany’s Enerparc, which had 30 of its containers stuck at the port of Chennai, said there was still some uncertainty about the process even though the duty had been scrapped. “Looks like it will take a month before we get our money (bank guarantees) back, but we are happy that the issue has been resolved,” Enerparc’s Managing Director Santosh Khatelsal said. Customs officials were not available for comment outside of regular business hours.

2018-05-10,"RIYADH, May 10 (Reuters) - Bahrain’s government has launched an energy fund that aims to raise $1 billion from local, regional and international investors to develop the kingdom’s energy assets, Oil Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa al-Khalifa said on Thursday. The Bahrain Energy Fund will receive its initial capital from local entities including Nogaholding, the investment arm of Bahrain’s National Oil and Gas Authority, as well as from investment banks Osool and SICO, according to the minister’s statement. It will invest in a range of energy projects across the downstream, mid-stream and upstream sectors, including developments in a newly discovered oil and gas resource. In April, Bahrain said it had discovered extensive tight oil and deep gas resources off the west coast of the kingdom, estimated to contain some 80 billion barrels of tight oil resources, a form of light crude oil held in shale deep below the earth’s surface. Bahrain, which has sub-investment grade ratings from all three major credit rating agencies, earned $4.3 billion in oil and gas revenue last year and ran a budget deficit of $2.7 billion. The small non-OPEC Gulf oil producer, with around 124.6 million barrels of proven reserves, gets it oil revenues from two fields: the onshore Bahrain field, and the offshore Abu Safah field, which is shared jointly with Saudi Arabia.

2018-05-10,"(Reuters) - Canadian Tire Corp will buy Norway-based Helly Hansen for C$985 million ($771.2 million) including debt, the retailer said on Thursday, making a bigger push into high-end sportswear in a bid to diversify itself further. Toronto-based Canadian Tire, whose stores sell everything from clothes to kitchen appliances across the country, already sells Helly Hansen’s trademark parkas. The 96-year old retailer has been steadily moving away from its roots of selling car parts and appliances to offering sportswear and apparel to attract millennial shoppers. Helly Hansen owns stores in more than 40 countries and counts the United States, United Kingdom, Norway and Canada as core markets. “With our capabilities and Helly Hansen’s trusted global brand and management team, we see tremendous opportunity for Canadian Tire and Helly Hansen, in Canada and internationally,” said Stephen Wetmore, chief executive officer of Canadian Tire. Helly Hansen, currently owned by the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, sells clothes and gear for sailing, skiing, mountaineering and hiking at its own stores as well as retailers like Nordstrom. With parkas that can cost more than $1,000, the European brand competes with American rivals like The North Face, Columbia Sportswear and Patagonia. In its acquirer’s home country, Helly Hansen competes with hip winter-wear maker Canada Goose. Canadian Tire said the deal is part of its strategy to sell its own brands internationally. “In addition to fitting in exceptionally well strategically, we get a well run profitable business that is immediately accretive to our earnings,” Canadian Tire Chief Financial Officer Dean McCann told analysts on a conference call. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter. Separately on Thursday, Canadian Tire also reported quarterly results that showed net income fell 8 percent to C$99.1 million in the three months to March 31 as expenses rose 7.8 percent. The company, like other retailers, has been spending more on online services and offering promotions to fend off competition from the likes of Amazon.com Inc. Excluding one-time items, Canadian Tire earned C$1.37 per share, while analysts on average had expected C$1.38, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Its same-store sales rose 5.2 percent as more people shopped its brands during the winter. Total revenue climbed 3.4 percent to C$2.81 billion.

2018-05-10,"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO) may sell more assets than expected this year, seeing strong interest from potential buyers after achieving a goal this week for 2018 divestitures. Enbridge has been under pressure to reduce leverage, one of the factors that has weighed on its share price. Selling assets would also help the company become a pure pipeline utility. The company announced two sales on Wednesday that will help it exceed its target for $3 billion in divestitures this year, but more deals are being discussed. “A good example of where we’re getting a lot of inbound interest is on the Canadian (gathering and processing) assets in whole or in part,” Chief Executive Al Monaco said on a quarterly conference call on Thursday. “Based on what we see at this point, we could move on additional asset sales, which would create added flexibility on (the) financial side.” On Wednesday, Enbridge said it would sell a U.S. gas pipelines business and part of its renewable energy portfolio  for a combined $2.5 billion to reduce debt, which stood at $61 billion as of end-2017. The company has also received bids as high as C$4.5 billion for the Canadian midstream assets it is selling as part of its debt-reduction efforts, Reuters reported. U.S.-listed shares of Enbridge (ENB.N) rose 2.3 percent to $32.85 and its Toronto-listed stock added 1.4 percent to C$42.03. The Toronto shares touched their highest in nearly two months. Enbridge’s first-quarter profit handily topped analysts’ forecasts on Thursday, as Canada’s largest pipeline operator transported higher volumes of crude oil and natural gas. Enbridge moved 2.63 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil on its Mainline system across Canada and the United States in the three months ended March 31, up from 2.59 million bpd a year earlier. The Enbridge Mainline system is Canada’s largest transporter of crude oil. It originates in Edmonton, Alberta and extends east across the Prairies to the Canada-U.S. border near Gretna, Manitoba. Calgary-based Enbridge’s first-quarter net income attributable to shareholders fell about 30 percent to C$445 million ($348.15 million) due to one-time costs.

Zambia urged South Africa’s government to do more to protect its nationals, saying the assaults could hurt international trade. Police said at least some of the attacks were carried out by people angered by truck companies hiring foreign drivers. Three trucks were destroyed by petrol bombs in two separate attacks in Limpopo Province on Wednesday evening, Zambia’s High Commission in Pretoria said in a statement. One of the Zambian drivers was attacked as he drove to Groblersbrug, a border crossing with Botswana, it added. Last week attackers burned around 30 foreign-owned trucks more than 800km (500 miles) further south on the N3 toll road in KwaZulu-Natal province, the High Commission said on Thursday. At least three of those trucks were Zambian, it added. Police said they did not know the nationalities of the other drivers. “There were many trucks burnt ... The protesters were complaining that truck owners are only hiring foreign nationals,” said KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele. Zambia’s High Commissioner, Emmanuel Mwamba, said the attacks could “halt the movement of goods and services between the two countries.” Most of Zambia’s copper exports reach the international market via South Africa’s roads and through its port at Durban.

2018-05-10,"(Repeating May 9 story without changes for wider distribution) By Sebastien Malo and Nichola Groom NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES, May 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - B uilders in California will be required to fit solar panels on most new homes from 2020 under new building standards adopted on Wednesday, a move that is the first in the United States and could provide a big boost to the solar industry. The decision, adopted unanimously by the five-member California Energy Commission, is part of the state’s effort to fight global climate change. It came despite estimates it would raise the up-front cost of a new home by nearly $10,000 in one of the most expensive parts of the country. The Commission estimated the standards will add about $40 to monthly mortgage payments but will compensate for that by saving residents $80 a month on energy bills. “We cannot let Californians be in homes that are essentially the residential equivalent of gas guzzlers,” Commissioner David Hochschild said ahead of the vote. The new building codes include updates to building ventilation and lighting standards. They are collectively expected to reduce the state’s greenhouse gas emissions by 700,000 metric tons over three years, a level equal to taking 115,000 cars off the road, according to state officials. The vote was a major win for the solar installation industry, which already counts California as its biggest market. Demand for solar equipment in California could rise by 10 percent to 15 percent because of the new standards, the Energy Commission forecast in a study earlier this year. Solar companies cheered the move, saying they hoped such requirements would one day be adopted in other states, too. “We think it’s another example of California policy preceding what will happen in other markets,” Tom Werner, chief executive of San Jose-based solar company SunPower, said in an interview ahead of the decision. California has one of the most ambitious renewable energy mandates in the country, with a goal of sourcing half of its electricity needs from renewable sources by 2030. At the end of 2017, it had reached about 30 percent, according to the CEC. Because of such policies, the most populous U.S. state has frequently been at odds with President Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of policies to combat climate change. Governor Jerry Brown is planning a global climate summit this September. Just 9 percent of single-family detached homes in the state of 39.5 million people currently have solar panels, according to a 2017 U.S. Department of Energy report the Energy Commission cited. Buildings that are shaded or have a roof that is too small to accommodate panels will be among those exempt, California Energy Commission spokeswoman Amber Pasricha Beck said.

2018-05-10,"LONDON/MOSCOW/DUBAI (Reuters) - When Qatar negotiated a deal to increase its holding in Rosneft it told the Russian oil company it wanted higher returns on its existing stake before it bought more, three sources familiar with the deal said. Qatar’s request was one of the triggers which prompted Igor Sechin, Rosneft’s boss and a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, to propose last week a $2 billion share buyback and an $8 billion debt reduction, marking a significant shift in the oil company’s strategy.  Days later, Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund Qatar Investment Authority, one of the world’s largest, raised its stake in state-controlled Rosneft to just under 19 percent from 4.8 percent bringing the value of its total investment to 10 billion euros. “The pledge to reduce debts and embark on a buyback was taken by Rosneft’s directors as part of preparations for Qatar’s investment,” one of the three sources familiar with the talks, said. Rosneft and the QIA declined to comment. Rosneft’s shift to focus on shareholder returns and debt reduction is its biggest in years after a decade of expansion which turned the group into Russia’s most indebted company with borrowings of more than $90 billion as of the end of 2017. This has had an impact in terms of Rosneft’s valuation versus its rivals. Rosneft’s market value is currently around $65 billion, while its production is at more than 5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest oil company by market value, has a market cap of $330 billion while producing less than 4 million boe.  Investors say this partly reflects the impact of Rosneft’s   heavy debts. “Rosneft is just plain cheap. Look at where it value stands versus peers and compare it with its production,” one of the sources involved in negotiation told Reuters asking not to be named as the matter is not public. Rosneft’s shares were also hit by sanctions on many Russian companies after Moscow’s annexation of Crimea and incursion in east Ukraine.     Sechin travelled to Doha in March together with his right hand man, first vice-president Pavel Fyodorov, who spent days negotiating the Qatar deal, according to two sources close to the talks. The new partnership could also help Rosneft expand its gas projects around the world, possibly in cooperation with Qatar Petroleum, the world’s largest producer of liquefied gas. For Qatar, the deal showed the country’s return to making large scale investments nearly a year after a boycott by its Gulf neighbours. The Rosneft deal would help Qatar guarantee long-term access to “good gas assets”, a Doha-based industry source said: “Qatar is thinking long-term game. By long-term they mean decades, when their own gas reserves could start depleting.” Qatar bought the Rosneft shares when a deal by Chinese energy firm CEFC to buy a 14 percent stake in the Russian oil company collapsed after an investigation into the Chinese group’s chairman. The Rosneft deal makes the QIA the third biggest investor in the oil company behind the Russian state with 50 percent and BP with 19.75 percent. Set up in 2005, the QIA benefited from Qatar’s gas boom amassing assets of over $300 billion and making it one of 10 world’s largest sovereign wealth funds, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute. Its investments from the United States to France and China effectively helped the tiny state to gather political support in some of the world’s biggest capitals.

2018-05-10,"(Adds quotes from Maas and Lavrov, background) MOSCOW, May 10 (Reuters) - The foreign ministers of Germany and Russia said on Thursday they were working to preserve the Iran nuclear deal after U.S. President Donald Trump announced Washington would leave it and ordered sanctions reimposed on Tehran. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said it was crucial Iran sticks to its obligations under the international 2015 deal despite Trump promising to impose new sanctions on Tehran. Moscow, he said, could use its influence on Tehran to that end. “It is necessary that Iran stays in the agreement. It is in Iran’s interest, too, to keep the agreement alive,” Maas said after meeting Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the deal on Tuesday, saying it was deeply flawed, a stance at odds with major U.S. allies and Russia and China. Under the accord, reached before Trump took office, Iran curbed its nuclear fuel production drive and won sanctions relief in return. Maas said Germany was seeking more details from the United States about fresh sanctions Washington was considering. The White House said on Wednesday that Trump was preparing to impose new sanctions on Tehran, perhaps as early as next week, but gave no details. “It is important to learn about the rules concerning the so called secondary effects, that is, what does it mean for a European company’s America business if it continues to do business with Iran,” Maas said. Lavrov said it was crucial that any new U.S. sanctions on Iran did not scuttle the hard-won deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. “Without doubt we will make sure firstly that this does not destroy the JCPOA. This is our common objective, we confirmed this,” Lavrov said at a joint conference with Maas. Lavrov said Moscow had urged Iran and its arch-enemy Israel to avoid acts that could lead to a spiral of Middle East conflict in the wake of Trump’s announcement. Iranian forces in Syria fired rockets at Israeli army bases in the Golan Heights early on Thursday, Israel said, prompting one of the heaviest Israeli barrages against Syria since the conflict there began in 2011. Lavrov said President Vladimir Putin had raised the issue with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was in Moscow on Wednesday to attend a military parade commemorating the Soviet victory in World War Two over Nazi Germany. Maas said attacks by Iranian forces were a provocation and that Israel had the right to self-defence.

2018-05-10,"BONN, Germany (Reuters) - Governments made slow progress on a “rule book” for a global climate accord after two weeks of talks ending on Thursday and agreed to a new round of negotiations to break a diplomatic logjam before a year-end deadline for a deal. Disputes among the senior climate officials from about 180 nations in Bonn included how rich nations will raise finance to a pledged $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing nations cope with rising temperatures and cut their emissions. “We can’t say failure. But overall we’ve been having slow progress,” Gebru Jember Endalew, chair of the group of least developed countries, told Reuters. Poor nations are most vulnerable to more droughts, floods and rising sea levels. Delegates agreed to hold an extra session in Bangkok from September 3-8 before environment ministers meet in Katowice, Poland, in December when the rule book for the Paris pact is due to be agreed. The 2015 Paris Agreement set a sweeping goal of ending the fossil fuel era this century with a trillion-dollar shift towards cleaner energies such as wind or solar power to help limit a rise in temperatures.  But it was vague on the details, such as how to measure financial flows to developing nations and how countries will report and monitor curbs on greenhouse gas emissions and ratchet up national goals every five years to limit global warming. “We have to be very, very clear that we have a lot of work in the months ahead and that we have to improve the pace of progress to achieve a good outcome in Katowice,” Patricia Espinosa, the U.N. climate chief, told a news conference. She said progress had been “satisfactory” in Bonn. Writing the “rule book” - formally known as “implementation guidelines” - is the biggest test of the international commitment to the Paris Agreement since President Donald Trump said in June he will pull out, doubting that climate change has a human cause. Elina Bardram of the European Commission said clear rules on curbing emissions, adapting to climate change and finance were vital in 2018 to bring the Paris agreement to life. But she said some elements were likely to need more time. “We have to accept that not all the nitty gritty details can be agreed by Katowice,” she said. Luke Daunivalu, chief negotiator for Fiji which is presiding at the talks in 2018, also said of the rule book: “How thick or how thin ... is an open question at the moment. It will become a little clearer at Bangkok.” Current national pledges to curb emissions put the world on track for a warming of about 3 degrees Celsius (5.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, far above a Paris goal of “well below” 2C (3.6F).

2018-05-10," LONDON (Reuters) - The United States and Saudi Arabia seem to have an understanding to keep the oil market well supplied and avoid a significant price rise after the U.S. re-imposition of sanctions on Iran. But exactly what this involves is not clear to the market, and may not even be clear to the two governments themselves, sowing uncertainty in the weeks ahead. “We have had various conversations with various parties about different parties that would be willing to increase oil supply to offset [the impact of sanctions]” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters on May 8. (For a chartbook, click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/2rxY4mS) “My expectation is not that oil prices go higher. To a certain extent some of this was already in the market, on oil prices,” Mnuchin added. He declined to name the countries or companies involved but since Saudi Arabia holds most of the world’s spare production capacity it is likely to have been included. In retrospect, the U.S. president’s April 20 tweet blaming OPEC for high oil prices can be seen as part of the negotiating. The basic bargain appears to be that the United States will impose tough sanctions that curb Iran’s oil exports and in return Saudi Arabia will avoid a damaging and politically controversial spike in prices. Saudi Arabia appeared to confirm the existence of an understanding by committing to maintain “the stability of oil markets” and more specifically to “mitigate the impact of any potential supply shortages”. The kingdom committed to “work with major producers within and outside OPEC as well as major consumers” to limit the impact from possible supply disruptions. The comments were made in an unusual statement issued by the kingdom’s ministry of energy and carried by the official news agency shortly after the sanctions were announced. They were subsequently confirmed by the energy minister in a statement on Twitter and in briefings with news organisations. While the existence of an understanding seems fairly well confirmed, its content remains a mystery. Neither Saudi Arabia nor the United States have indicated a specific price level that would trigger a production increase, and the kingdom has declined to give a specific commitment to replace any fall in Iranian oil exports now or in the future. Instead, Saudi sources have briefed the media to say the kingdom would not act alone to increase production and intends to consult with other OPEC and non-OPEC members. OPEC sources have indicated the organisation has up to 180 days, until the end of the sanctions phase-in period, before needing to decide whether to increase output elsewhere to compensate for Iran. The safest thing for OPEC may be to leave output unchanged in the near term and monitor the situation (“OPEC in no hurry to decide if extra oil needed to offset Iran”, Reuters, May 10). In the past, Saudi Arabia has usually been slow to raise production in response to rising prices, preferring the extra revenue to using spare capacity to put a lid on prices. But in a market like oil, traders will respond to the prospect of supply curbs in future by driving up the price now. So if Saudi Arabia and its allies stall, the market will reach its own judgement about the impact on the supply-demand balance. The United States and Saudi Arabia may have reached a detailed agreement on how to handle the prospective reduction of Iranian oil exports and its impact on oil prices. But it is also possible that they have reached nothing more than a vague high-level political consensus or “gentleman’s agreement” and plan to improvise. If so, that leaves plenty of room for misunderstandings and uncertainty. The recent rise in crude oil prices will very likely push average U.S. gasoline prices above the psychologically important threshold of $3 per gallon next week, for the first time since 2014. And if prices continue to escalate, they could become a political issue in the United States ahead of congressional elections in November. Neither the Trump administration nor Saudi Arabia will want to be blamed for driving oil prices significantly higher. The U.S. president has already said that oil prices are “artificially very high” and this “will not be accepted”, while Saudi Arabia has been trying to push prices higher, and resisting calls for it to ease production curbs. Saudi officials have said that the market can absorb higher prices, though they do not want them to rise too much. But there is a lot of uncertainty about how much is “too much”. In the end, Saudi Arabia and the United States may have differing views about what would constitute an unacceptable spike in prices in response to sanctions. Whatever they may want, benchmark Brent futures prices have risen by almost $4 per barrel or 5 percent over the last week, and more than $6 or 9 percent higher over the last month, and are still trending higher.

2018-05-10,"ABU DHABI, May 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When people picture the United Arab Emirates, what likely comes to mind are desert sands, skyscrapers and a blue sea under a shimmering sun. Agriculture does not. There are good reasons for this: the federation of seven emirates is hampered by high temperatures, a lack of arable land, salty soil and steep production costs. And that is without accounting for the occasional voracious locust swarm. So it is hardly surprising that the UAE imports nearly 90 percent of its food needs, according to the Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative, a data research organization. This reliance on the global food trade brings opportunity, said Saudi Arabian entrepreneur Omar Al Jundi, who has built the Middle East’s first commercial vertical farm in Dubai. Badia Farm - the word means ‘oasis’ in Arabic - grows greens like radish, kale, mustard, basil and arugula in a controlled, indoors environment using hydroponic technology and LED lights. “As a region that has struggled to grow crops due to largely hostile desert landscapes, our farm offers a viable solution to farming that produces harvests 365 days of the year,” he said. “The produce will not only be cheaper than imported goods, but fresher too, as the farms will be producing all year round.” The farm, which began production late last year, is on an 800-square-metre plot of land in one of Dubai’s main industrial areas, and produces two hundred boxes of green vegetables a day. Though this pales in comparison to the world’s largest vertical farm - which operates on 6,500 square metres of a former steel factory in New Jersey in the United States - it marks a big step for alternative farming in this region. Vertical farming is taking off elsewhere too: Europe’s first commercial farm opened near Amsterdam last year, and Shanghai will next year start a 250-acre agricultural district with skyscrapers dedicated to growing fruit and vegetables. Vertical farming brings some important benefits, said Al Jundi: because produce is grown in a controlled environment there is no need for pesticides or chemicals. And they use much less water - 90 percent less than open-field farming. Growing food locally for the firm’s 30 UAE clients - mainly restaurants and hotels - means a smaller carbon footprint, and saves on transport costs. “It makes no sense to order produce that arrives in boxes in the back of a ship from as far tens of thousands of miles away when it can be grown at home,” he said. Even though the UAE imports most of its food, the emirates are food secure, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). However, its food security is not without risk, said Hina Kamal, a research analyst at the UAE University’s College of Food & Agriculture, as it is reliant on vulnerabilities in supplier countries and on the international food trade market. Another concern is climate change, which is likely to increase food prices in the years ahead, said Majid Sultan Al Qassimi of the UAE’s ministry of climate change and environment. Although the UAE has strategic reserves in place to protect it from short-term disruptions, he said, “ensuring global food security will be challenging in the future due to impacts of climate change”. Part of the solution, he said, is to boost domestic production through sustainable means; another is “to diversify imports and investments to ensure that the country is food secure in the long-run”. Other solutions include setting up storage facilities abroad and acquiring farmland in Africa, Europe and Asia. Emirates NBD, a large regional bank, says UAE investors were part of at least 28 deals in the past 50 years covering about 1 million hectares of farmland globally. The emirates’ drive to secure land abroad to assure its food supply is not risk-free, Kamal said, and could be undone by political conditions in those countries or by climate change. “It is possible that some of (the countries) will be highly affected by climate change - both through more extreme weather events and reduced productivity over time.” Droughts or food shortages could, for example, see host governments impose export bans, she said, which is why boosting productivity at home is the lowest-risk way to ensure food security in the decades to come. It is also more sustainable. FUTURE-PROOFING The UAE will need to improve its agricultural productivity in the coming decades to meet demand, said Qassimi, and to do so in the face of rising global temperatures that are expected to worsen extreme weather events. “All of this has a direct impact on agricultural production, affecting both food producers and those who depend on them. The UAE is no exception,” he said. Nor, for that matter, is the Gulf region, noted a report last year from the Emirates Wildlife Society and World Wildlife Fund (EWS-WWF), which evaluated the likely effects of climate change on food security. The UAE is a major regional hub for the re-export of food commodities, it pointed out, and the consequences of climate change, including hotter weather, could affect those facilities. Any resultant food price spikes would hurt the poorest the most, and that could drive a long-term need for food subsidies. There are other factors too, not least water. The UAE’s agricultural sector accounts for just 1 percent of its economy, the EWS-WWF report noted, yet uses about one-third of its water - vastly disproportionate to its GDP contribution, said Fanack Water, a research group. Given that water is more expensive than electricity in the UAE - and given that regular farmers benefit from subsidies for water - Al Jundi of Badia Farm said ending such breaks would make vertical farming a cheaper solution. “The money spent on powering vertical farms is relatively much lower than of the cost of water used in open fields.” That said, Badia does use plenty of electricity: from pumping water to powering the artificial lighting and computers that monitor temperatures. But looking ahead, said Al Jundi, it is working with the government on a shift to renewable energy. The impact one vertical farm can have, though, is limited, and will be felt only on the margins: it will not change the UAE’s reliance on countries such as Brazil, India, Iran and South Africa for cereals, sugar and food oils, for example. But what it represents - a better way of growing produce in a region that is facing significant challenges from climate change - is important, Al Jundi said. ""This technology will be a major contributor to agriculture sustainability, food diversity and security as it enhances crop production and lowers their cost,"" he said.

2018-05-10,"COLOMBO, May 10 (Reuters) - State run Sri Lankan fuel retailer Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) will raise retail prices for gasoline and diesel from midnight on Thursday after being hit by rising oil prices, a government spokesman said. CPC, which has around two-thirds of the country’s retail fuel market, will increase the price of gasoline by 20 rupees to 137 rupees a litre; diesel goes up by 14 rupees to 109 rupees; and kerosene oil will rise by 57 rupees to 101 rupees. It follows Lanka IOC, the only other fuel retailer in Sri Lanka, which lifted its prices in March. CPC had been under pressure to raise prices after incurring a loss of 9.9 billion rupees ($64 million) in the first two months of the year due to rising oil prices. “After a long discussion, we decided to revise the prices after evaluating the global oil price increase,” Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne told reporters in Colombo. “With this increase it will help to reduce the losses to the CPC.” Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the cabinet approved the fuel price formula and under the formula there would be revisions in every two months. The government cut petrol prices in January 2015 after President Maithripala Sirisena was voted into office, and has not increased prices since then, fearing unpopularity among voters. Lanka IOC, a subsidiary of Indian Oil Corp, raised its prices on March 24 after incurring a cumulative loss of 1.3 billion rupees in the last four quarters. Lanka IOC’s prices will be lower than CPC’s after Thursday’s increases, but Lanka IOC Managing Director Shyam Bohra said they are likely to go up again. “Definitely prices will be increased because internationally crude oil is at a peak for the last few years,” he told Reuters. Under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to boost revenue, Sri Lanka’s government increased the excise duty on diesel by 10 rupees to 13 rupees per litre from August last year, but asked fuel retailers not to pass on the cost to consumers.

2018-05-10,"LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - OPEC is in no hurry to decide whether to pump more oil to make up for an expected drop in exports from Iran after the imposition of new U.S. sanctions, four sources familiar with the issue said, saying any loss in supply would take time. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has a deal with Russia and non-OPEC producers to cut supplies that has helped erase a global glut and boosted oil prices to their highest since 2014. Officials are considering whether a drop in Iranian exports and a decline in supply from another OPEC member, Venezuela, demands adjusting the deal that runs to the end of 2018. Ministers meet in June to review the policy. U.S. sanctions on Iran will have a six-month period during which buyers should “wind down” oil purchases, meaning any loss of supply will not be immediately felt in the market. “I think we have 180 days before any supply impact,” an OPEC source said when asked about any plans for action. A second OPEC source said that, while the need to add extra supply was being considered, the safest thing for the group to do for now was to sit tight and monitor the situation. Oil LCOc1 reached $78 a barrel on Thursday, its highest since November 2014, two days after President Donald Trump said the United States was abandoning an international nuclear deal with Iran and would impose new sanctions. Iran, which pumps about 4 percent of the world’s oil, exports about 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) to Europe and around 1.8 million bpd to Asia. Sales to Europe are seen by analysts as the more likely to be reduced by the sanctions. “It’s too early to know now the impact,” said a third OPEC source. “We need to wait and see what China will do, what Japan will do. Who will buy Iranian oil and who will side with Trump.” As part of the supply deal, OPEC pledged to cut 1.2 million bpd from supplies from its members. In practice, the group has overshot this, partly because Venezuelan output has plunged due an economic crisis. Oil ministers from OPEC and its partners meet on June 22-23 in Vienna to review the existing agreement. Before that, technical officials meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on May 22-23 when the issue of whether extra barrels are needed to offset any Iranian loss will likely come up, the second source said.  A fourth OPEC source also said it was too soon to tell if extra oil was needed, citing Iran’s ability to keep much of its exports flowing under a previous round of sanctions. “Too early to judge,” he said. On Wednesday, a separate OPEC source had said Saudi Arabia was monitoring the impact of the U.S. move on oil supplies and was ready to offset any shortage but would not act alone. This source had also said the impact of U.S. sanctions on Iranian supplies needed to be assessed first and Saudi Arabia did not expect any physical impact on the market until the third or fourth quarters. Analysts also expect Saudi Arabia to be cautious and step in only to offset an actual supply loss, not an anticipated one. “Saudi will remain reactive and not pre-empt forward fundamentals. If a supply dislocation emerges and inventories get abnormally low, then OPEC and Russia may act,” said Yasser El Guindi, market strategist at Energy Aspects. “People are putting the cart before the horse.”  Editing by Edmund Blair and Jason Neely",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-opec/update-1-opec-in-no-hurry-to-decide-if-extra-oil-needed-to-offset-iran-sources-idUKL8N1SH4J6,10 May 2018,"* Too early to know how much Iranian supply will fall

2018-05-10,"HANOI, May 10 (Reuters) - Police in Vietnam arrested the chairman and the chief accountant of Binh Son Refining and Petrochemical Co. Ltd. on suspicion of embezzlement on Thursday as the communist-led government widens a crackdown on corruption. Nguyen Hoai Giang, chairman, and Pham Xuan Quang, chief accountant, were accused of “abusing power to appropriate property”, the Ministry of Public Security said in a statement. Binh Son Refining and Petrochemical is a unit of the state-run Vietnam Oil and Gas Group and the operator of the Southeast Asian country’s first oil refinery, Dung Quat. The ministry said in the statement it was widening the investigation into the case. It did not elaborate. Giang, Quang and their lawyers were not immediately available for comment. The 130,000-barrel-a-day Dung Quat refinery in the central province of Quang Ngai became operational in 2009, meeting around one-third of Vietnam’s demand for refined petroleum products. In January, the government raised $245 million by selling a 7.79 percent stake in Binh Son Refining and Petrochemical in an initial public offering. Indian Oil Corp applied to be the refinery’s strategic investor in February. Thursday’s arrests come amid a corruption crackdown in Vietnam that has seen several senior government officials and executives of state-owned enterprises arrested and jailed. According to Vietnam’s penal code, anyone found guilty of abusing power to appropriate property may face life in prison. Earlier this year, Vietnam jailed former Politburo member Dinh La Thang for 31 years for financial irregularities at Vietnam Oil and Gas Group.

2018-05-10,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: Global coal trade vs. Newcastle price: tmsnrt.rs/2ruII2O By Clyde Russell NUSA DUA, Indonesia, May 10 (Reuters) - Asia’s coal miners, shippers and traders are seeing strong demand and rising prices for their fuel, and they expect this happy situation to persist for several years to come. It was a challenge to find anybody pessimistic about the outlook for coal in Asia, the world’s largest producing and consuming region, at this week’s annual gathering of the industry on the Indonesian resort island of Bali. This was in stark contrast to the Coaltrans Asia conferences in prior years, where the moods were gloomy as the industry battled to survive five years of declining prices from 2011 to 2015 and policies aimed at cutting the use of the polluting fuel in the two biggest importers, China and India. Certainly, it would seem that the industry has some reason to be optimistic, with Chinese imports up 9.3 percent in the first four months of the year, and hopes that India’s two years of declining imports will end in 2018. Prices are also performing better recently, with Australian benchmark thermal coal at Newcastle Port up to $101.35 a tonne in the week ended May 6, a gain of 11.6 percent from the low so far this year of $90.68 at the end of March. Even low-rank Indonesian coal is performing better, with Argus Media assessing 4,200 kilocalorie per kilogram (kcal/kg) coal at $42.79 a tonne in the week to May 4, up from the 2018 low of $41.08 on April 13, and 18.2 percent higher than the low for 2017 of $36.20 in May of that year. The main driver of coal’s improving performance is Chinese demand, with traders reporting buying interest from China for a variety of coal grades, from low-rank Indonesian fuel to higher quality coal from Australia. The bullish Chinese story may have taken a slight hit in the April numbers, with customs data showing coal imports dropped to 22.8 million tonnes from 26.7 million the month before. But traders at the Bali event expressed confidence that this was merely a blip, caused largely by some increased scrutiny by customs and certain port restrictions, impediments that they expect to only last a short time. India’s imports were also lower month-on-month in April, dropping to 15.5 million tonnes from March’s 16.6 million, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts. But India’s imports are up slightly in the first four months of 2018, to 60.4 million tonnes, a gain of 3 percent over the 58.6 million recorded in the same period last year. Although both China and India have shown only modest increases in imports so far this year, this is stoking optimism in the industry, especially when added to additional emerging demand from other Asian countries, such as Pakistan and Vietnam. But while there may be scope to be bullish on the short- to medium-term outlook for coal, the risk factors for the industry appear to be mounting. On the supply side it appears that it will be quite difficult to add any more tonnes to the market to meet additional demand. Indonesia, the top shipper of thermal coal used in power plants, has put in place policies aimed at directing more of its coal to the domestic market, and the government appears to be mulling restricting overall output in order to conserve resources for the long term. Like many government policies in Indonesia, this is likely to go through several iterations and changes, but the trend does appear clear, and it’s toward lower overall exports over time. In Australia, the main constraint on boosting exports is environmental activism against the industry, which is becoming more sophisticated as well as popular with the public. Witness the struggles of India’s Adani Enterprises to finance and build its Carmichael mine, which is currently the largest coal project in the world aimed at the seaborne market. While Adani has all the necessary government approvals, it’s struggling to find financial backers and is facing a non-stop public campaign against Carmichael, which is starting to cause its political support to evaporate. The other major supplier of coal to Asia, South Africa, has capacity constraints and is unlikely to be able to boost its shipments, leaving additional tonnes to come from new mines in Mozambique, and possibly from the United States and Colombia. The looming supply constraints suggest prices will rise, which may be seen as good news for miners, but ultimately serves to undermine coal’s main advantage over natural gas and renewables, namely being cheaper. This is already happening in India, where power plants relying on imported coal are struggling to be profitable, while solar generators are able to offer lower prices. Also, supply constraints may cause power plant developers in countries such as Vietnam and the Philippines to think twice about making a 40-year commitment to building a coal-fired plant. If your plan is to buy cheap Indonesian low-rank coal for your power plant for the coming decades, you now have to consider the possibility that there won’t be enough, and what there is won’t be cheap. The coal industry in Asia also tends to ignore the pollution elephant in the room. The idea that public pressure may halt coal projects or force cutbacks in its consumption seems alien to many in the industry, despite evidence that this is exactly what is happening in China, and has already happened in Europe. Ten years ago the conversation I had most often with people in China’s coal sector was how they were going to have to cut back on burning the fuel. It took some years, but the trend is now clear in China, and the authorities are actively looking to boost the use of natural gas, nuclear and renewables over coal. It’s almost inevitable that similar pressures will emerge in India, and any other country that decides to make coal its main source of power. While the coal sector in Asia is currently enjoying something of a renaissance, the longer-term outlook is darkening.

Brent crude rose to another 3-1/2 year high of $77.89 overnight amid fears of supply disruptions after President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran and ordered sanctions be re-imposed. The dollar meanwhile eased slightly from 2018 highs ahead of U.S. April inflation numbers on Thursday and as currency markets eyed the Bank of England’s policy meeting and inflation report. “It’s difficult to know what the principal drivers are given there’s a whole host of events, but it could well be that the effect of oil prices on resources companies is outweighing negatives elsewhere,” said Investec economist Philip Shaw. “But I think the main thing the market is looking out for is whether growth in the global economy has peaked and is slowing down,” he said, citing reduced growth data in the euro zone and Britain as examples. Energy shares led Asian stock indexes higher, pushing the 47-country MSCI world equity index to its highest level in three weeks. It is now positive on the year, up 0.3 percent from its starting level on Jan. 1. European shares largely took their cues from Asian and U.S. peers and rose, but the gains were tempered as British phone company BT reported disappointing results and Italian political worries weighed on sentiment. The pan European STOXX 600 Index started on the front foot but was 0.2 percent lower around midday, pulled down by Italian stocks, which fell 1.5 percent. Italian government debt also sold off sharply, with 10-year yields hitting a seven-week high as Italy’s 5-Star Movement and the far-right League moved closer to forming a government of anti-establishment parties. A crucial obstacle was removed late on Wednesday when former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, the League’s main ally, gave a green light to the talks, accepting a demand from 5-Star that his Forza Italia party take no part in the next government. In Malaysia, meanwhile, an alliance of opposition parties spearheaded by Mahathir Mohamad won the general election, putting the 92-year old strongman on course for a return to the prime minister’s office he occupied for 22 years. Over the past day the Malaysian ringgit has slid nearly 3 percent in the one-month non-deliverable forward market and the cost of insuring the country’s debt against default has risen. Britain’s FTSE 100 index was flat on the day after the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold. It said weak growth during the snowy start to 2018 was likely to be only temporary, but that it wanted to see a pick-up in the next few months before raising borrowing costs. The British central bank had until recently been expected by investors to hike rates this month. The BoE also cut growth and inflation forecasts for the coming years, pushing sterling lower. The U.S. Federal Reserve now remains the only major central bank that appears to be on course for rate hikes, with New Zealand’s Reserve Bank saying it will keeping the Official Cash Rate (OCR) at 1.75 percent “for some time to come”. The New Zealand dollar retreated to a five-month low of $0.6915. Earlier, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.6 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei climbed 0.3 percent. South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.5 percent and Shanghai SSEC was 0.2 percent higher.

2018-05-10,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iranian nuclear deal has cast a shadow over an already fraught election in Iraq, where Tehran and Washington have vied for influence since the U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003. The removal of a Sunni dictatorship cleared the path for the country’s Shi’ite majority, from which the three top contenders for the premiership, including incumbent Haider al-Abadi, are drawn. The outcome of the May 12 ballot is too close to call. Whoever wins must balance Iraq’s interests - and the need to reduce the struggling economy’s dependence on oil - with those of the United States and Iran, whose intensifying rivalry makes that more difficult. Abadi and his main rivals - predecessor Nuri al-Maliki and new challenger Hadi al-Amiri, a hardline militia commander at the head of a powerful paramilitary coalition aligned with Iran - tilt heavily towards Tehran. With Trump increasing pressure on Iran, its Shi’ite clerical leadership will be even more determined to maintain its patronage in Iraq. For Iran, Iraq is the most important Arab state, even more than Syria and Lebanon, where it also holds political and military sway. That is because Iran and Iraq share a border and Iraq is positioned in the heart of the Gulf region. Iraq is also Iran’s main route for supplying arms and fighters to Syria, where it has deployed with allied Iraqi and Lebanese Shi’ite militias to back President Bashar al-Assad in the civil war.     One concern for Iraq is the risk of clashes between the 5,000 U.S. troops there and Shi’ite paramilitaries notionally under Baghdad’s command but answering to Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, and to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. “The Iraqis are very worried. They don’t want Iraq to become a new theatre of ... war between Iran and the United States,” said one senior Western envoy. “If there is a war between Iran and the United States, part of it will be here.” The U.S. and Iran had found a common enemy in Islamic State, which at one point held about a third of Iraq, mainly in the north and the west. Its rapid advance owed much to the collapse of Iraq’s army, hollowed out by the sectarian policies of the Maliki government. Many Iraqis attribute the jihadis’ subsequent defeat to men like Amiri and the Iranian-trained militias, rather than to  U.S.-led coalition forces. America mainly provided air power, while relying on Kurdish fighters on the ground in both Syria and Iraq. But while Iran sees Iraq as the most strategically important Arab state, some experts believe Tehran will focus more on Israel and the Syrian battlefield. The conflict there threatens to draw in Israel. Only hours after Trump’s announcement on the Iran nuclear deal it launched air strikes against what it says were Iranian and Hezbollah assets, creeping closer to Israel’s borders. Iranian forces in Syria shelled Israeli army outposts across the Syrian frontier overnight, Israel said, prompting one of the heaviest Israeli strikes in Syria since the war began in 2011. Iraq’s foreign ministry called Trump’s decision “hasty and rash”, and said Washington’s withdrawal from the nuclear accord “goes in the direction of escalation which would bring nothing but destruction and the desolation of war” in the Middle East. In the worst-case scenario, diplomats in the region said, Iran would target U.S. interests in Iraq as their militias did in 2005 by firing rockets into the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. But Iran might prefer to steer clear of Iraq and use Syria instead. Iraq’s Shi’ite leaders nonetheless face a dilemma about how to balance policy between the United States and Iran. Some Iraqi leaders, among them Abadi, say they want to steer clear of U.S.-Iranian rivalries. They would “want to follow the model of non-aligned policies, friends of all”, said another Western diplomat. Others, including Amiri, believe that Iraq’s single most important relationship is with Iran, and that they have to reinforce that relationship. Also important to Iraq is building bridges with the minority Sunni community, although some politicians are wary of Abadi’s tentative rapprochement with Sunni Saudi Arabia, nurtured after decades of estrangement. “Their greatest nightmare is to wake up and have the Sunnis or Arabs undermine their ascendancy and dominance in the system, as happened with Daesh,” said the second Western diplomat, referring to Islamic State’s advances in 2014. “They are reminded that Iran will be their ultimate resort when that nightmare happens ... When the (Islamic State) caliphate was declared, they (the Iranians) were the first to come to their rescue, not the U.S. or anybody else.” Iraq’s Shi’ites do not want to be dominated by Iran, but Trump’s move this week against Tehran may make that harder. “After (Trump’s decision) the question is how do you implement a balanced policy when Iran will use Iraq’s airspace to arm its militias in Syria? What will they do?”, said the diplomat. Powerful militias trained, funded and armed by Iran and led by Amiri might answer to Tehran rather than Baghdad. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has built Shi’ite militias at the heart of the so-called Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) into a structure to rival the Iraqi army and security forces. It did something similar within Lebanon’s Shi’ite Hezbollah movement, which has helped Tehran project military strength across the region.

2018-05-10,"LISBON/BARCELONA, May 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A fter learning that three babies died in a government hospital in the Sierra Leone city of Bo last November when a power cut switched off machinery keeping them alive, London-based energy adviser Michael Liebreich decided to act. He set up Project Bo to provide a solar electricity and battery system to supply uninterrupted power to the hospital’s oxygen devices and baby “warmers”. The campaign has so far raised just over three-quarters of the £100,000 ($135,830) it is seeking. A shift in thinking is needed to channel more funding to places where a lack of clean, reliable power is putting babies in danger and holding people back, Liebreich told a Lisbon conference on improving access to energy this month. “The economic value of saving that life is currently not financeable,” said the founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, urging greater efforts to work out how it could be turned into something “markets can spray money at”. Shine, an investment campaign officially launched at the Portugal forum, aims to do just that. It brings together more than 35 faith, financial and philanthropic organisations - including the IKEA Foundation, the World Evangelical Alliance and Oikocredit, a cooperative and social impact investor - that will galvanise new money and expand solutions to boost energy access in the world’s poorest communities. U.N. data showed last week that roughly 1 billion people on the planet still have no electric power, while about 3 billion cook with polluting fuels such as kerosene, crop waste and dung. Investments by governments and business are lagging far behind the amounts needed to close the gap in providing sustainable and affordable energy to everyone by the U.N. deadline of 2030. Experts estimate that would require just 0.2 percent of global gross domestic product. While the energy sector receives some $2 trillion in investments each year, only $13 billion of that prioritises those living without electricity, according to Shine. Ellen Dorsey, executive director of Wallace Global Fund, a private foundation and one of the founding partners in the campaign, said Shine - which aims to mobilise $100 million this year - will help investors put their money to good use in getting power to the world’s poorest people. “We needed to have a champion, a constituency to stand up and say the billion (people) must be reached first,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from Washington DC. Virtually all the 17 Sustainable Development Goals - from ending poverty and hunger, to providing healthcare for all - will be influenced by people’s access to energy, she added. Wallace Global Fund has committed to put 1 percent of its capital into impact investments in energy access, and to provide at least $1 million in grants each year with a focus on helping women in sub-Saharan Africa. Rachel Kyte, CEO of Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), a U.N.-founded body which organised the Lisbon forum, said entrepreneurs trying to build local markets for small-scale solar systems in developing countries are struggling to find capital, including from development banks. “The money is beginning to flow from the top, but... it’s not reaching some markets and in other markets, it’s reaching (there) but it’s too expensive,” she said in an interview this week. Shine, in which SEforALL is a partner, hopes to attract new funders that could contribute to filling those gaps - whether in geographical locations or supply chains - with low-cost “patient” capital which is invested for at least three years. “We need to stay committed until we get the job done,” said Dorsey. “This can’t be a fad.” Some governments - including in Mexico and Rwanda - have set up funds dedicated to boosting investment in renewables and getting electricity to those without, and are cross-subsiding those efforts with levies on large power consumers. Meanwhile, energy investment businesses like SunFunder are starting to raise larger amounts of debt finance for companies that are building off-grid solar systems in sub-Saharan Africa, often based on pay-as-you-go technology. In a report this month, SunFunder said “catalytic capital” from foundations and impact investors, including Facebook and The Rockefeller Foundation, had been critical in helping attract institutional investors to its debt funds, by bearing upfront risks. Yet despite a rise in investor interest, development and energy experts in Lisbon agreed that commercial dollars are unlikely to reach the most marginalised communities any time soon - especially impoverished women. “There is a crying need among financiers to better understand the needs of small enterprises doing the last mile,” said Lucy Stevens of development charity Practical Action, referring to companies bringing clean energy to remote areas. Researchers spoke about the importance of helping local people develop businesses that will stimulate demand for the power generated by micro-grids using renewable energy sources. In south Tanzania, for example, a community-run hydropower utility set up agricultural processing plants whose revenues go towards maintenance costs and subsidising cheaper power. But in some cases, where a sustainable business model is simply not possible, governments and development agencies may need to look at bundling access to energy into social safety nets for the poorest, said SEforALL’s Kyte and others. Andrew Scott of the London-based Overseas Development Institute said there would always be a proportion of people who cannot afford to pay for electricity or cleaner cooking fuels. Under social protection programmes, they could be given cash transfers and vouchers, or free power connections and equipment, he added. Kyte said “all kinds of new capital” would be needed to meet the world’s energy access targets. To that end, the Shine campaign can link the growing ranks of philanthropists and investors looking to make a social impact with in-depth evidence on how to achieve that by supplying clean energy to the poor, she said. “We’ve been able to converge these different conversations around ‘this is the time, this is the place, we are the people’,” she added. $1 = 0.7362 pounds

2018-05-10,"LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - OPEC is in no hurry to decide whether to pump more oil to make up for an expected drop in exports from Iran after the imposition of new U.S. sanctions, four sources familiar with the issue said, saying any loss in supply would take time. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has a deal with Russia and non-OPEC producers to cut supplies that has helped erase a global glut and boosted oil prices to their highest since 2014. Officials are considering whether a drop in Iranian exports and a decline in supply from another OPEC member, Venezuela, demands adjusting the deal that runs to the end of 2018. Ministers meet in June to review the policy. U.S. sanctions on Iran will have a six-month period during which buyers should “wind down” oil purchases, meaning any loss of supply will not be immediately felt in the market. “I think we have 180 days before any supply impact,” an OPEC source said when asked about any plans for action. A second OPEC source said that, while the need to add extra supply was being considered, the safest thing for the group to do for now was to sit tight and monitor the situation. Oil LCOc1 reached $78 a barrel on Thursday, its highest since November 2014, two days after President Donald Trump said the United States was abandoning an international nuclear deal with Iran and would impose new sanctions. Iran, which pumps about 4 percent of the world’s oil, exports about 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) to Europe and around 1.8 million bpd to Asia. Sales to Europe are seen by analysts as the more likely to be reduced by the sanctions. “It’s too early to know now the impact,” said a third OPEC source. “We need to wait and see what China will do, what Japan will do. Who will buy Iranian oil and who will side with Trump.” As part of the supply deal, OPEC pledged to cut 1.2 million bpd from supplies from its members. In practice, the group has overshot this, partly because Venezuelan output has plunged due an economic crisis. Oil ministers from OPEC and its partners meet on June 22-23 in Vienna to review the existing agreement. Before that, technical officials meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on May 22-23 when the issue of whether extra barrels are needed to offset any Iranian loss will likely come up, the second source said.  A fourth OPEC source also said it was too soon to tell if extra oil was needed, citing Iran’s ability to keep much of its exports flowing under a previous round of sanctions. “Too early to judge,” he said. On Wednesday, a separate OPEC source had said Saudi Arabia was monitoring the impact of the U.S. move on oil supplies and was ready to offset any shortage but would not act alone. This source had also said the impact of U.S. sanctions on Iranian supplies needed to be assessed first and Saudi Arabia did not expect any physical impact on the market until the third or fourth quarters. Analysts also expect Saudi Arabia to be cautious and step in only to offset an actual supply loss, not an anticipated one. “Saudi will remain reactive and not pre-empt forward fundamentals. If a supply dislocation emerges and inventories get abnormally low, then OPEC and Russia may act,” said Yasser El Guindi, market strategist at Energy Aspects. “People are putting the cart before the horse.”  Editing by Edmund Blair and Jason Neely",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-opec/opec-in-no-hurry-to-decide-if-extra-oil-needed-to-offset-iran-sources-idUKL8N1SG70C,10 May 2018,"OPEC is in no hurry to decide

2018-05-10,"* Samir refinery’s debts estimated at $4.7 bln * Several offers made, no deal reached so far * Staff salaries slashed, shutdown sparks protests By Ahmed Eljechtimi MOHAMMEDIA, Morocco, May 10 (Reuters) - Morocco’s only refinery will find it tougher to find a buyer the longer it stays closed as equipment ages and qualified staff move away, industry sources say, almost three years after operations were halted due to heavy debts. One source said court-appointed trustees had received offers for the 200,000 barrel-per-day Samir plant, controlled by Saudi billionaire Mohammed al-Amoudi’s Corral Holdings and shut by the government in 2015 over unpaid taxes. But he said trustees had failed to agree terms with potential buyers of the plant, which has total debts estimated at 44 billion dirhams ($4.7 billion), the equivalent of about 4 percent of the North African nation’s gross domestic product. The source did not say why terms were not agreed for Samir, which was a victim of the crash in oil prices from their 2014 peaks that left the plant struggling to service debts some of which were linked to crude loaned when prices were higher. Shuttering the plant, which court-appointed experts value at 21.6 billion dirhams, has left Morocco reliant on imported refined products and sparked protests by workers. Energy imports cost Morocco 70 billion dirhams last year. “The longer the crisis drags on, the more difficult it will be for Samir to find a buyer,” said the source, who asked not to be named because of the sensitive nature of the subject. He said this was “not only due to the piling up of debt but also because equipment is getting old and some of the best human resources are tired of waiting and have sought other jobs.” Other industry sources and parties interested in the plant have previously said idling the refinery, which the government said owed 13 billion dirhams in unpaid taxes, made it more difficult to find a buyer. Hussain al-Yamani, head of oil and gas industries at the CDT union, said the government should work faster to sell the plant in Mohammedia, about 20 km (12 miles) north of Casablanca, saying 20,000 jobs at the plant and in related industries were at stake. He also said delays would make a sale tougher. Some staff at the refinery, which had directly employed 850 people, still show up for work, mainly to maintain the plant. But salaries have been slashed, hurting the economy of the town and prompting protests and sit-ins over the shutdown. “We live in acute uncertainty,” said Farid Baroudi, 46, an employee whose wages were halved. Trustees first invited bids for the refinery in February 2017 and have extended the deadline for offers. Industry sources said in May 2017 that Swiss trader Glencore and U.S. private equity firm Carlyle Group teamed up to bid, aiming to recoup about $600 million in loans. A banking source familiar with the situation said talks had not progressed, while the firms and trustees have not commented. A diplomatic source said an Iraqi oil ministry delegation visited Samir in April this year. Local website Media24.ma said OPEC member Iraq might be interested in the refinery to boost refined product exports to Europe and North Africa. No further developments have been reported. “Most offers are from parties whose capacity to relaunch Samir is shrouded in doubt,” said energy expert El Mehdi Fakir. “The complicated legal proceedings and debt are making it hard to sell.” Corral, with a 67.26 percent stake in the plant, has sought international arbitration against the government, saying it breached an investment agreement and demanding compensation for the decision to liquidate Samir. Yamani, head of oil and gas industries at the CDT union, said the state should nationalise Samir “to safeguard thousands of jobs and save Morocco’s refining industry” if no sale was agreed. He said the shutdown was costing Mohammedia about 1 billion dirhams a year as a result of unpaid salaries and lost fees from services linked to the plant. Government spokesman Mustapha El Khalfi said the state would ensure oil supplies and protect employees’ rights as the legal process proceeded. “Morocco will defend its interests,” he said. $1 = 9.3990 Moroccan dirham

2018-05-10,"ZAGREB (Reuters) - The Croatian government proposed a special law on Thursday to facilitate the construction of an EU-backed liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in the northern Adriatic. The floating terminal is expected to start operations in 2020. The European Union wants the facility to help diversify sources of supply and reduce dependence on Russian gas, most notably for countries in central Europe.  Brussels will invest 101.4 million euros (88.5 million pounds), or 28 percent of the project’s assessed value. The law, which will help untangle property issues and other factors, is planned to get parliamentary approval in an urgent procedure, but the project still faces opposition from local municipalities which have voiced concern about the terminal’s environmental impact. They have staged several protests and say they are considering legal action against the project. The energy and environment ministry say the project would not pose a significant threat to the environment. The new law envisages construction of the terminal on the island of Krk in two stages, the first involving a floating terminal followed by a land-based facility. “It is in Croatia’s interest to ensure fast implementation of this project,” the state secretary in the energy ministry, Mile Horvat, told a cabinet session. “The law, among other things, regulates property issues and concession fees to municipal authorities for using maritime domains.”  Croatia is currently running a tender for delivery of a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) for the planned terminal. An FSRU is a special type of ship where LNG brought in by tanker is converted back to gas to feed into the grid. LNG Croatia, the company behind the project, is also preparing a second round of bidding for use of the terminal’s capacity, which was initially planned at 2.6 billion cubic metres of gas a year. The final capacity of the floating terminal will depend on demand. U.S. government officials have also expressed strong support for the LNG terminal and have said that U.S. energy companies are keen to be major suppliers for it.

2018-05-10,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s northern city of Shijiazhuang will take aim at everything from coal-fired power plants to crematoriums and even public toilets in its latest effort to fix its notorious pollution problem, the city government said on Thursday. Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei province, which surrounds the Beijing metropolitan region, has given all 52 crematoriums in the city until the end of October to replace or upgrade their furnaces to ensure they meet emission standards, the government said in a statement on its website. Furnaces at chemical, steel, non-ferrous metal and coking factories have to install ultra-low emission equipment by the same date.    The moves are among 44 measures outlined in a 2018 action plan released by the city government that targets emissions from industries such as transportation, construction and open-pit mining. But pollution sources from residential activities are also being marked, with Shijiazhuang banning outdoor barbecues and the sale of fireworks. It has also pledged action against “foul-smelling” air emitted from rubbish transfer stations and public toilets. The smog-prone city aims to cuts its concentration of particulate matter that is smaller than 2.5 microns, hazardous airborne pollutants known as PM2.5, to 74 micrograms per cubic meter in 2018, down 14 percent from 2017.  PM2.5 pollution is considered especially hazardous since the particles can lodge deep inside the lungs. Shijiazhuang achieved a 13.7 percent drop in PM2.5 levels last year but still ranked seventh from the bottom of 365 cities nationwide, according to data compiled by Greenpeace. In March, Hebei set up a “punishment and reward system” designed to give incentives for local cities to improve air quality. Shijiazhuang said it will also launch a punishment system to push local authorities to adopt “iron-fisted pollution-control measures”.     It also asked industrial companies to be ready to adopt capacity restriction measures in the coming winter, but detailed plan will be published after September.

2018-05-10,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s biggest energy explorer, Inpex Corp, (1605.T) said on Thursday it may drop its second attempt to join in developing Iran’s South Azadegan oilfield after U.S. President Donald Trump said he will re-impose sanctions on Tehran. The comment illustrates the turmoil that Trump’s withdrawal from a 2015 agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear programme has set in motion for potential investors in the Iranian economy. Inpex relinquished a 10 percent stake in Azadegan in 2010 because sanctions by the United States on Iran made it difficult to access financing for the project. According to energy consultants Wood Mackenzie, the Azadegan fields are considered one of the world’s biggest oil discoveries of the past 30 years with an estimate of about 33.2 billion barrels of oil in place. Oil production at the fields was planned to reach 600,000 barrels per day.  The lifting of the sanctions in 2016 after the agreement opened the way for Inpex to again participate in developing the oilfield. “We recognise that it has become difficult for us to engage in activities for the bidding” after Trump’s decision this week, an Inpex spokeswoman told Reuters by phone. President Trump on Tuesday said he was pulling out of the multi-party nuclear agreement and will reinstitute U.S. sanctions against Tehran that were suspended under the 2015 accord. Other energy projects could be affected, including Total’s multi-billion dollar natural gas project in Iran, unless waivers can be secured. While governments in Europe and Asia were still trying to delay the sanctions by salvaging some parts of the deal with Iran, analysts had little hope that opposition to the U.S. action would prevent the restrictions. Fereidun Fesharaki, the founder and chairman of energy consultancy FGE, said Europe and Asia would not be able or willing to significantly fight against the U.S. sanctions. “They will grumble and accept it. There is no one who will realistically choose Iran over the U.S.,” he said. Inpex remains interested in participating in Iran’s oil and gas sector because of its “high potential” and would be interested in joining the project if the situation changes, the Inpex spokeswoman said. In August 2017, Inpex joined a workshop held in Iran on the South Azadegan field to gather information for the bidding, the spokeswoman added, without giving further details on the status of the bidding process due to a confidentiality agreement.

Brent crude rose to another 3-1/2 year high of $77.89 overnight amid fears of supply disruptions after President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from a nuclear accord with Iran and ordered sanctions to be reimposed. The dollar meanwhile eased slightly from 2018 highs ahead of U.S. April inflation numbers later on Thursday and as currency markets eyed the Bank of England’s policy meeting and inflation report. “It’s difficult to know what the principal drivers are given there’s a whole host of events, but it could well be that the effect of oil prices on resources companies is outweighing negatives elsewhere,” said Investec economist Philip Shaw. “But I think the main thing the market is looking out for is whether growth in the global economy has peaked and is slowing down,” he said, citing reduced growth data in the euro zone and Britain as examples. Energy shares led Asian stock indexes higher, pushing the 47-country MSCI world equity index to its highest level in three weeks. It is now positive on the year, up 0.3 percent from its starting level on Jan. 1. European shares largely took their cues from Asian and U.S. peers and rose, but the gains were tempered as British phone company BT reported disappointing results and the pan European STOXX 600 Index was only marginally higher. Britain’s FTSE 100 Index was still up on the day ahead of a Bank of England policy meeting at which rates are expected to be kept on hold, a sea change from expectations a few weeks ago, when a hike seemed nailed on. Overall, the U.S. Federal Reserve remains the only major central bank that appears to be on course for rate hikes, with New Zealand’s Reserve Bank saying it will keeping the Official Cash Rate (OCR) at 1.75 percent “for some time to come”. The New Zealand dollar retreated to a five-month low of $0.6915. Italian government debt sold off sharply in early trades, with 10-year yields hitting a seven-week high as Italy’s 5-Star Movement and the far-right League moved closer to the formation of a government of anti-establishment parties. A crucial obstacle was removed late on Wednesday when former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, the League’s main ally, gave his green light to the talks, accepting a demand from 5-Star that his Forza Italia party take no part in the next government. Nor is this the only electoral concern on investor minds today; in Malaysia, an alliance of opposition parties spearheaded by Mahathir Mohamad won the general election, putting the 92-year old strongman on course for a return to the prime minister’s office he occupied for 22 years. Over the past day the Malaysian ringgit has slid nearly 3 percent in the one-month non-deliverable forward market and the cost of insuring the country’s debt against default has risen. Earlier, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.6 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei climbed 0.3 percent. South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.5 percent and Shanghai SSEC was 0.2 percent higher. Brent crude futures were up 0.8 percent to $77.66 a barrel, the highest since November 2014 and building on gains of about 3 percent on Wednesday. U.S. light crude futures were up 0.6 percent at $71.59.

2018-05-10,"BONN, Germany (Reuters) - A U.S. architect of the Paris climate accord under ex-President Barack Obama has been working to bolster the pact at global talks in Germany, reckoning it matches long-term U.S. interests despite U.S. President Donald Trump plans to pull out. “I don’t want to see the Paris Agreement roll off the tracks,” Todd Stern, who was Obama’s Special Envoy for Climate Change, told Reuters during two-week talks ending on Thursday in Germany on a detailed “rule book” for the 2015 Paris Agreement. “That’s not in the interests of the United States,” he told Reuters. Stern is with the World Resources Institute think-tank at the Bonn meeting of almost 200 nations and also works at the Brookings Institution. He, and many other delegates, said the United States has been concerned for decades under both Republican and Democratic administrations to ensure that rules governing environmental pacts were strong and oblige China, for instance, to abide by the same standards as rich nations. In Bonn, the U.S. delegation is also insisting on strong rules for reporting and monitoring greenhouse gas emissions in a rare overlap between Obama’s and Trump’s interests. A rule book is due to be in place by the end of 2018 at a meeting in Poland. A strong rule book “is not only in the interests of the U.S. … It would mean everyone can say: ‘that’s a pretty good deal’,” Stern said. Stern said he was listening to delegates and giving advice. Washington is still formally part of the Paris accord, which aims to end the fossil fuel era this century, even though Trump announced plans to quit last year and bolster the U.S. fossil fuel industry. Formally, a pullout will only take effect in 2020. [nL1N1IZ1BA] “It’s not surprising to me,” Patricia Espinosa, head of the U.N. Climate Change Secretariat, said of Stern’s presence.  She told Reuters there is always a need “for people with skills, who can advise people, who can give a perspective on different things.” Asked about Stern, a U.S. State Department official said: “the United States has always supported access for non-party stakeholders in the (U.N. climate) process, including business groups, NGOs, and other civil society representatives.” Alden Meyer, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said a strong rule book could make it easier for a future U.S. administration to re-enter the deal. “U.S. policy since the 1990s has been to hold countries to the same standards,” he said.

2018-05-10,"(Reuters) - French manufacturing group Alstom (ALSO.PA) said on Thursday it had signed an agreement with General Electric (GE.N) to exit three joint ventures in return for a payment of 2.594 billion euros ($3.08 billion). The three joint ventures, in grid, nuclear and renewable assets, were created as part of Alstom’s 12.35 billion euro sale of its energy business to General Electric in 2015. “Alstom intends to exercise its options to sell its interests in the ‘Renewables’ and ‘Grid’ Joint Ventures in 2018,” the company announced in a statement.  The exercise of these options between September 4 and 10 would imply General Electric had exercised its option to acquire Alstom’s interest in the “nuclear” joint venture, it said.  The three joint ventures would be transferred to GE’s full ownership on Oct. 2, it said.

2018-05-10,"WARSAW/GDYNIA (Reuters) - State-controlled PGE (PGE.WA) has abandoned its leading role in plans to build Poland’s first nuclear power station as it focuses on new wind farms in the Baltic Sea, two sources said. Two other sources said state-run refiner PKN Orlen (PKN.WA) could take on PGE’s role.       PGE, the largest Polish power group, announced a nearly $10 billion offshore wind project in March but has also been responsible for the nuclear project. Both plans are part of a major change in Polish policy. Coal mining provides around 80 percent of its energy and thousands of jobs but makes it one of Europe’s biggest polluters. The government promised to defend coal from competition but has been forced to look for alternatives to fill an electricity shortfall and to meet European Union emissions targets.  One source said PGE could not fund both projects and cheap technology had swung the decision in favour of wind. PGE could still play a smaller role in the nuclear project which has been delayed and still needs government approval.  “PGE cannot afford both - offshore wind and nuclear. The decision was taken to go for offshore,” the source said. A government source also said that PGE would focus on offshore. A spokesmen for PGE declined to comment. For a graphic on change in Market Value of Polenergia and PGE, click reut.rs/2woZUvo Asked whether it could take the project on, PKN Orlen’s press office said in an emailed statement that the company “continuously analyses a number of different projects that could be part of the long-term development plans of the group.” Poland’s ruling conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party promised before elections in 2015 to defend the coal industry and put in place laws to prevent new investment in both onshore and offshore windfarms.  But in March it changed tack and proposed a law to make it easier to build wind turbines. That is currently being debated in parliament. If the law is passed, as expected, several other wind farm projects could also proceed. Polenergia (PEPP.WA), owned by the Kulczyk family, has said it would like to build a wind farm in the Baltic by 2022. PKN Orlen is also considering building one. PGE said in March that it wants to build offshore windfarms with a capacity of 2.5 gigawatts (GW) by 2030.  PGE did not say how this would be financed. The state owns 57.39 pct and there are over a hundred other small shareholders, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data.  The group’s cash amounted to 2.5 billion zlotys ($712.92 million) at the end of 2017. It could issue more bonds as part of its 2 billion euros and 5 billion zlotys bond programs.  Analysts and investors say that offshore wind farms are the easiest and fastest way for Poland to fill the expected capacity gap from coal and reduce CO2 emissions in line with EU’s 2030 targets as Poland seeks improved ties with Brussels.    They provide more electricity than onshore windfarms, which Poland already has, and can be built more quickly than a nuclear power plant. The decision to open up the offshore power industry could also draw in investors. Statoil said in April it would join Polenergia’s offshore project  which has drawn interest from other international wind companies.     “We received phone calls from all over Europe after Statoil’s decision was announced. If such a player has entered, we need to be in too, many investors say,” said Maciej Stryjecki, the president of the board at SMDI Advisory Group.  Some investors will also be waiting to see if Poland offers subsidies in cash or payments for getting connected to the grid.     “Even if we take into account the very positive trend in the decline in offshore technology costs, offshore wind farms will not be built without support,” said Michal Michalski, Polenergia management board member. The government’s official position on this is not clear. Officials in the energy ministry were not available to comment.     The PiS minister responsible for Poland’s power and gas infrastructure, who reports directly to the prime minister, said companies should not need such incentives.    “We expect that offshore windfarms will be built without support, but the falling cost trend is very encouraging,” Piotr Naimski told Reuters. He has been a strong advocate of coal but said offshore would be a part of Poland’s energy mix in 2025-30.         Reducing the dependence on coal is an emotional issue in Poland. The coal industry still employs 83,000 people and some are worried the shift in strategy could lead to job cuts. “I do not believe that offshore wind can be profitable,” said Jaroslaw Grzesik, the head of one of the biggest trade unions in Polish coal industry. “We are definitely against it.”  But other industries could benefit from the development of offshore power. The Polish Wind Energy Association (PWEA) estimates that offshore windfarms with a total capacity of 6 GW would help create around 77,000 new jobs and add around 60 billion zlotys to economic growth. Local authorities in the windy Baltic resort and port of Leba, which is close to the future offshore sites, are hoping  the industry could provide year-round employment as a balance to seasonal jobs.  “If investors choose Leba, a base and functional and technical facilities for wind farms could be created here,” the mayor of Leba, Andrzej Strzechminski, said.  PWEA has identified around 70 potential Polish suppliers to the offshore industry including shipyards Crist SA and GSG Towers. Their workers’ boat-building skills can be transferred to make windmill components.     GSG Towers, a unit of Gdansk Shipyard Group, is looking forward to Poland’s first offshore windmills and contracts with new clients.    “We are not talking anymore about whether Poland needs to develop offshore wind projects...there are no more question marks and we only talk about when and how to do it right,” said Liudmyla Buimister who was the CEO of GSG Towers, a unit of Gdansk Shipyard Group, until April 16. It has approached PGE and Polenergia about building a device to send electricity generated at sea to the onshore grid.

2018-05-10,"(Repeats Wednesday’s story with no changes to text) * Trump pulls U.S. out of Iran nuclear deal * Europeans failed to persuade Trump to stay in * Saudi Arabia, Israel hail Trump’s decision * Saudi and Israeli leaders had visited U.S. * GRAPHIC-Iran's nuclear facilities tmsnrt.rs/2K9tVRX By John Irish, Rania El Gamal and Steve Holland PARIS/DUBAI/WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - When Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince visited France in April, he oozed confidence that President Donald Trump would pull the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal which Riyadh has long opposed. Answering reporters’ questions in Paris, two weeks after talks with Trump in Washington, Prince Mohammed bin Salman compared the deal to the 1938 Munich Agreement which was meant by European powers to appease Nazi Germany but ended in war. Where French, German and British diplomatic efforts failed with Trump, Saudi Arabia’s appear to have succeeded. A source close to Saudi policymakers said Washington and Riyadh, Iran’s main regional rival, had been discussing the 2015 nuclear deal “for some time” before Trump announced on Tuesday that the United States was pulling out of it. The source said it was “obvious” from the Crown Prince’s talks with Trump in the White House on March 20 and a visit to Riyadh a month later by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that there had been a “coordination” of positions. “We were for it and we worked on it,” another Saudi source said of Riyadh’s diplomacy. Also celebrating is Israel, another of Iran’s enemies. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled what he said was evidence of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons programme on April 30. Most of the purported evidence Netanyahu presented dated to the period before the 2015 accord was signed, although he said Iran had also kept important files on nuclear technology since then, and continued adding to its “nuclear weapons knowledge”. Tehran dismissed Netanyahu as “the boy who cried wolf”, and called his presentation propaganda. Although Israeli officials said they did not know whether Trump had been swayed by the information, the president referred to it in his announcement on Tuesday. Netanyahu had talks with Trump in the White House in March and Israeli diplomats worked hard behind the scenes to get their country’s views across on the deal, intended to prevent Tehran obtaining a nuclear bomb but seen by opponents as flawed. Asked how much of the Israeli ambassador to Washington’s time had been spent arguing the case against the deal, Deputy Minister for Diplomacy Michael Oren told Reuters: “Ball-park guess? Something in the vicinity of 90-plus (percent) ... This issue is, for Netanyahu, paramount.” Trump’s announcement was a blow to French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Both tried to change Trump’s mind on Iran during visits to the White House in April, and both failed. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson also made a last-minute dash to Washington but did not get to see the president. He put Britain’s case at talks with Pompeo and in an interview with “Fox & Friends” on cable channel Fox News, which Trump regularly watches. Despite their efforts, European leaders knew by mid-April that the chances of persuading Trump to stay in the nuclear deal were fading, European diplomats said. “Macron’s visit was the last resort,” a European official told Reuters in Brussels, referring to the French leader’s talks with Trump in the White House on April 24. Describing the last month of diplomacy as “disastrous”, the official said: “For weeks all the indications from the White House and State Department were: ‘He’s out (of the deal)’.” On Wednesday, the European allies were seeking to salvage the nuclear deal and preserve their business with Iran. Trump’s message to the Europeans in the run-up to his announcement was that they must come up with a way to toughen the nuclear deal if the United States was to remain in it, said sources familiar with the discussions. He pressed for a separate deal to go alongside the nuclear agreement that would address other U.S. concerns about Iran such as its ballistic missile program, which was not covered in the 2015 accord, they said. Progress was made in the negotiations, but not enough to sway Trump. The sources familiar with the debate said Trump wanted a separate agreement with the other main signatories of the original deal — France, Britain, Germany, China and Russia. But Berlin said the agreement would have to be submitted to a European Union body for approval, and this appeared to stall the effort, they said. Pompeo told the German and British foreign ministers and a senior French official by telephone last Friday that Washington would no longer pursue the process with Europe. The European and U.S. positions were too far apart on the so-called sunset clauses allowing for some restriction on Iran’s nuclear enrichment programme to be lifted. By midway through last week, European diplomats “felt like we were going through the motions,” a European official said. Some European diplomats believed any chance of persuading Trump to stay in the deal had gone even before Macron visited Washington. They saw Pompeo’s appointment in March as a deadly blow, and it was quickly followed by the arrival in the White House of John Bolton, another Iran hawk, as national security adviser. Rex Tillerson, the previous secretary of state, had seen value in staying in the deal, as did Defense Secretary James Mattis. The president reluctantly agreed to give the deal more time in April 2017 when an initial renewal deadline approached. But by the next deadline, last July, Trump was furious at aides for trying to persuade him to stay in the deal, a source familiar with the debate said. “You mean you had three months, and you didn’t do anything?” he told them, the source said. In October, Trump announced he would not permit U.S. certification of Iranian compliance with the deal, setting the United States on the path that it reached on Tuesday. A White House official said that in the days leading up to the president’s announcement, top aides had not been seeking aggressively to talk Trump out of withdrawing because his mind had been made up. By then, European officials were despondent, a European diplomat said. “We realised we have to buy time. On the eve of the Trump decision, all we could do is to tell the Iranians: don’t do anything rash,” the diplomat said. Writing by Steve Holland and Timothy Heritage; Additional

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open higher as well, with Britain’s FTSE adding 0.2 percent, Germany’s DAX rising 0.4 percent and France’s CAC gaining 0.3 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.6 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei climbed 0.3 percent. South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.5 percent and Shanghai was 0.2 percent higher. Brent crude futures rose 0.8 percent to $77.82 a barrel, the highest since November 2014 and building on gains of about 3 percent on Wednesday. U.S. light crude futures were up 0.6 percent at $71.69. Energy shares soared as crude oil prices reached 3-1/2-year highs, with investors betting the U.S. withdrawal from a nuclear agreement with Iran would increase tensions in the Middle East and curtail oil supply. Overnight, the Dow gained 0.75 percent and the S&P 500 climbed nearly 1 percent, with the S&P energy index rallying 2 percent. Rising oil prices in turn pushed up U.S. Treasury yields by fanning inflation concerns. The 10-year Treasury note yield rose to a two-week high above the 3 percent threshold before pulling back to 2.982 percent. Shored up by higher yields, the dollar climbed to a 4-1/2-month high of 93.416 against a basket of six major currencies overnight. The dollar index was last at 92.956. The New Zealand dollar retreated to a five-month low of $0.6915 after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) wrongfooted hawks. It kept interest rates steady as expected, but said its next move might be a cut or a hike. “The RBNZ surprised markets with a slight dovish shift,” said Imre Speizer, an economist at Westpac. The euro crawled back to $1.1871 after slipping overnight to $1.1823, its lowest since late December. The dollar was steady at 109.690 yen after brushing an eight-day peak of 109.930. Investors in emerging markets, already facing financial uncertainty in countries such as Argentina and Turkey, received another jolt after a stunning election upset in Malaysia. Moody’s ratings agency said the country was now in uncharted territory after an alliance of opposition parties led by former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad shocked the ruling coalition. Over the past day the Malaysian ringgit slid nearly 3 percent in the one-month non-deliverable forward market and the cost to insure against the country’s debt default has risen. “The surprise win by Mahathir’s coalition party is likely to see an increase in policy uncertainty at least in the short term with market volatility likely to be higher,” said Sian Fenner, lead Asian economist at Oxford Economics.

2018-05-10," NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) - Asia’s coal miners, shippers and traders are seeing strong demand and rising prices for their fuel, and they expect this happy situation to persist for several years to come. It was a challenge to find anybody pessimistic about the outlook for coal in Asia, the world’s largest producing and consuming region, at this week’s annual gathering of the industry on the Indonesian resort island of Bali. This was in stark contrast to the Coaltrans Asia conferences in prior years, where the moods were gloomy as the industry battled to survive five years of declining prices from 2011 to 2015 and policies aimed at cutting the use of the polluting fuel in the two biggest importers, China and India. Certainly, it would seem that the industry has some reason to be optimistic, with Chinese imports up 9.3 percent in the first four months of the year, and hopes that India’s two years of declining imports will end in 2018. Prices are also performing better recently, with Australian benchmark thermal coal at Newcastle Port up to $101.35 a tonne in the week ended May 6, a gain of 11.6 percent from the low so far this year of $90.68 at the end of March. Even low-rank Indonesian coal is performing better, with Argus Media assessing 4,200 kilocalorie per kilogram (kcal/kg) coal at $42.79 a tonne in the week to May 4, up from the 2018 low of $41.08 on April 13, and 18.2 percent higher than the low for 2017 of $36.20 in May of that year. The main driver of coal’s improving performance is Chinese demand, with traders reporting buying interest from China for a variety of coal grades, from low-rank Indonesian fuel to higher quality coal from Australia. The bullish Chinese story may have taken a slight hit in the April numbers, with customs data showing coal imports dropped to 22.8 million tonnes from 26.7 million the month before. But traders at the Bali event expressed confidence that this was merely a blip, caused largely by some increased scrutiny by customs and certain port restrictions, impediments that they expect to only last a short time. India’s imports were also lower month-on-month in April, dropping to 15.5 million tonnes from March’s 16.6 million, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts. But India’s imports are up slightly in the first four months of 2018, to 60.4 million tonnes, a gain of 3 percent over the 58.6 million recorded in the same period last year. Although both China and India have shown only modest increases in imports so far this year, this is stoking optimism in the industry, especially when added to additional emerging demand from other Asian countries, such as Pakistan and Vietnam. But while there may be scope to be bullish on the short- to medium-term outlook for coal, the risk factors for the industry appear to be mounting. (For a graphic showing Global coal trade vs. Newcastle price, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2ruII2O)  On the supply side it appears that it will be quite difficult to add any more tonnes to the market to meet additional demand. Indonesia, the top shipper of thermal coal used in power plants, has put in place policies aimed at directing more of its coal to the domestic market, and the government appears to be mulling restricting overall output in order to conserve resources for the long term. Like many government policies in Indonesia, this is likely to go through several iterations and changes, but the trend does appear clear, and it’s toward lower overall exports over time. In Australia, the main constraint on boosting exports is environmental activism against the industry, which is becoming more sophisticated as well as popular with the public. Witness the struggles of India’s Adani Enterprises to finance and build its Carmichael mine, which is currently the largest coal project in the world aimed at the seaborne market. While Adani has all the necessary government approvals, it’s struggling to find financial backers and is facing a non-stop public campaign against Carmichael, which is starting to cause its political support to evaporate. The other major supplier of coal to Asia, South Africa, has capacity constraints and is unlikely to be able to boost its shipments, leaving additional tonnes to come from new mines in Mozambique, and possibly from the United States and Colombia. The looming supply constraints suggest prices will rise, which may be seen as good news for miners, but ultimately serves to undermine coal’s main advantage over natural gas and renewables, namely being cheaper. This is already happening in India, where power plants relying on imported coal are struggling to be profitable, while solar generators are able to offer lower prices. Also, supply constraints may cause power plant developers in countries such as Vietnam and the Philippines to think twice about making a 40-year commitment to building a coal-fired plant. If your plan is to buy cheap Indonesian low-rank coal for your power plant for the coming decades, you now have to consider the possibility that there won’t be enough, and what there is won’t be cheap. The coal industry in Asia also tends to ignore the pollution elephant in the room. The idea that public pressure may halt coal projects or force cutbacks in its consumption seems alien to many in the industry, despite evidence that this is exactly what is happening in China, and has already happened in Europe. Ten years ago the conversation I had most often with people in China’s coal sector was how they were going to have to cut back on burning the fuel. It took some years, but the trend is now clear in China, and the authorities are actively looking to boost the use of natural gas, nuclear and renewables over coal. It’s almost inevitable that similar pressures will emerge in India, and any other country that decides to make coal its main source of power. While the coal sector in Asia is currently enjoying something of a renaissance, the longer-term outlook is darkening.

2018-05-10,"TOKYO, May 10 (Reuters) - Japan’s biggest energy explorer, Inpex Corp, said on Thursday it may drop its second attempt to join in developing Iran’s South Azadegan oilfield after U.S. President Donald Trump said he will re-impose sanctions on Tehran. The company was forced to relinquish a 10 percent stake in Azadegan in 2010 because sanctions by the United States on Iran made it difficult to access financing for the project. According to energy consultants Wood Mackenzie, the Azadegan fields are considered one of the world’s biggest oil discoveries of the past 30 years with an estimate of about 33.2 billion barrels of oil in place. Oil production at the fields was planned to reach 600,000 barrels per day. The lifting of the sanctions in 2016 after an international agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme had opened the way for Inpex to again participate in developing the oilfield. “We recognise that it has become difficult for us to engage in activities for the bidding” after Trump’s decision this week, an Inpex spokeswoman told Reuters by phone. President Trump on Tuesday said he was pulling out of the multi-party nuclear agreement and will reinstitute U.S. sanctions against Tehran that were suspended under the 2015 accord. Inpex remains interested in participating in Iran’s oil and gas sector because of its “high potential” and would be interested in joining the project if the situation changes, the Inpex spokeswoman said. In August 2017, Inpex joined a workshop held in Iran on the South Azadegan field to gather information for the bidding, the spokeswoman added, without giving further details on the status of the bidding process due to a confidentiality agreement. The news service for Iran’s oil ministry reported on May 7 that the country planned to tender 14 exploration blocks and Iranian energy officials said that the country’s oil industry would continue to develop despite any new U.S. sanctions.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.4 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei climbed 0.1 percent. South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.4 percent and Shanghai edged up 0.3 percent. Brent crude futures rose 0.7 percent to $77.76 a barrel in early trade, the highest since November 2014 and building on gains of about 3 percent on Wednesday. U.S. light crude futures rose 0.8 percent. But battered emerging market investors got another jolt after a stunning election upset in Malaysia. Moody’s ratings agency said the country was now in uncharted territory after an alliance of opposition parties led by former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad shocked the ruling coalition. The ringgit slid more than 2 percent in the non-deliverable forward market and the cost to insure against a Malaysian debt default rose. “The surprise win by Mahathir’s coalition party is likely to see an increase in policy uncertainty at least in the short term with market volatility likely to be higher,” said Sian Fenner, lead Asian economist at Oxford Economics. Special public holidays were declared for Thursday and Friday following the elections.

That said, the opposition parties that won is a loose coalition and it remains to be seen if they can retain a united front.” Overnight, the Dow gained 0.75 percent and the S&P 500 climbed nearly 1 percent, with the S&P energy index rallying 2 percent. Energy shares soared as crude oil prices reached 3-1/2-year highs, with investors betting the U.S. withdrawal from a nuclear agreement with Iran would increase tensions in the Middle East and curtail oil supply. Rising oil prices in turn pushed up U.S. Treasury yields by fanning inflation concerns. The 10-year Treasury note yield rose to a two-week high above the 3 percent threshold before pulling back a little to 2.986 percent. Shored up by higher yields, the dollar climbed to a 4-1/2-month high of 93.416 against a basket of six major currencies overnight. The dollar index was last at 92.979. The New Zealand dollar retreated to a five-month low of $0.6916 after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) wrongfooted hawks by keeping interest rates steady and saying the next move might be a cut or a hike. “The RBNZ surprised markets with a slight dovish shift. It kept the official cash rate (OCR) on hold, as was widely expected, but notably allowed for the OCR to move ‘up or down’, rather than simply on hold – a slightly dovish development in our view,” said Imre Speizer, economist at Westpac.

2018-05-10,"* Brent, WTI crude oil futures mark highest since Nov 2014 * China’s Shanghai crude oil futures reach record-peak * U.S. this week announced new sanctions against oil exporter Iran * Iran producers almost 4 pct of global oil supplies By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, May 10 (Reuters) - Oil prices clocked up more multi-year highs on Thursday as traders adjusted to the prospects of renewed U.S. sanctions against major crude exporter Iran amid an already tightening market. The United States plans to impose new sanctions against Iran, which produces around 4 percent of global oil supplies, after abandoning an agreement reached in late 2015 which limited Tehran’s nuclear ambitions in exchange for removing U.S.-Europe sanctions. Oil prices rose sharply in response to the announced measures. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, hit their strongest since November 2014 at $77.76 per barrel on Thursday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures also marked a November-2014 high, at $71.75 a barrel, and they still stood at $71.67 a barrel at 0219 GMT, up over half a dollar, or 0.7 percent, from their last settlement. In China, which is Iran’s single biggest buyer of oil, Shanghai crude futures posted their biggest intra-day rally since their launch in March, rising more than 4 percent to a dollar-denominated record of around $73.40 per barrel. Goldman Sachs said the planned unilateral U.S. sanctions against Iran would likely have a “high level of efficiency”. As a result of sanctions and because of risks to supplies elsewhere, especially in Venezuela, the U.S. bank said “this leaves risk our summer $82.50 per barrel Brent price forecast (is) squarely skewed to the upside”. Analysts had little hope that opposition to the U.S. action would prevent sanctions from going ahead. “Europe and China will not fight against the U.S. sanctions. They will grumble and accept it. There is no one who will realistically choose Iran over the U.S.,” said energy consultancy FGE. “We believe the previous 1 million bpd limit for exports (imposed during previous sanctions) will be reimposed. As before, it may take several rounds of reductions to reach target levels,” FGE’s founder and chairman Fereidun Fesharaki wrote in a note. He added that condensate, a super-light form of crude oil that was excluded in the last round of sanctions, may well be included. Despite this, Fesharaki said the near-term impact on the oil market would be limited due to a 180-day wind down period as planned sanctions are implemented. “But the impact will escalate as we approach November (i.e. the end of 180-day wind down period) ... Oil prices will certainly move up, and $90-100 per barrel prices may again be on the cards.” Sanctions come amid an oil market that has already been tightening due to strong demand, especially in Asia, and as top exporter Saudi Arabia and top producer Russia have led efforts since 2017 to withhold oil supplies to prop up prices. U.S. crude inventories C-STK-T-EIA fell by 2.2 million barrels in the week to May 4, to 433.76 million barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), slightly above the 420 million barrels five-year average level. One factor that could prevent markets from tightening further is soaring U.S. oil output. Weekly U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA hit another record last week, climbing to 10.7 million barrels per day (bpd). That’s up 27 percent since mid-2016 and means U.S. output is creeping ever closer to that of top producer Russia, which pumps around 11 million bpd. Reporting by Henning Gloystein

2018-05-10,"WASHINGTON/PARIS (Reuters) - Dismayed European allies sought on Wednesday to salvage the Iran nuclear deal and preserve their Iranian trade after President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the landmark accord and ordered sanctions reimposed on Tehran. “The deal is not dead. There’s an American withdrawal from the deal but the deal is still there,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said. But Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, a pragmatist who helped engineer the 2015 deal to ease Iran’s economically crippling isolation, told French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in a phone call that Europe had only a “limited opportunity” to preserve the pact, the Iranian Students’ News Agency reported. “(Europe)... must, as quickly as possible, clarify its position and specify and announce its intentions with regard to its obligations,” ISNA quoted Rouhani as telling Macron. Macron, who like other European leaders had lobbied Trump to keep the agreement that was struck before the Republican president took office in January 2017, urged Rouhani to adhere to the deal and to consider broader negotiations. Trump said on Tuesday he would revive U.S. economic sanctions, which would penalize foreign firms doing business with Tehran, to undermine what he called “a horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made”. On Wednesday, he said Iran would now either negotiate or “something will happen.” It was not immediately clear what actions he was suggesting would take place. The White House said later that Trump was preparing to impose new sanctions on Iran, perhaps as early as next week, but gave no details. Iran has drafted a “proportional” plan to cope with the U.S. withdrawal, the official news agency, IRNA, quoted government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht as saying. He said without elaborating that budgets had been drawn up to handle various scenarios. The fruit of more than a decade of diplomacy, the nuclear agreement was clinched in July 2015 by the United States, France, Britain, Germany, Russia, China and Iran. It was designed to prevent Iran developing a nuclear bomb in return for the removal of sanctions that had crippled its economy, not least by Washington threatening to penalize businesses anywhere in the world that traded with Iran. Trump complained that the deal, the signature foreign policy achievement of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, did not address Iran’s ballistic missile program, its nuclear activities beyond 2025 or its role in conflicts in Yemen and Syria. His decision raises the risk of deepening conflicts in the Middle East, puts the United States at odds with European diplomatic and business interests and casts uncertainty over global oil supplies. Oil prices rose more than 2 percent, with Brent touching a 3-1/2-year high. [O/R] In the latest violence, Iranian forces on the Syrian-held side of the Golan Heights shelled Israeli army outposts on the strategic plateau but caused no casualties, an Israeli military spokesman said, saying Israel had retaliated. Syrian air defences confronted Israeli rockets on Syrian territory without specifying the location, Syrian state media reported, quoting a military source. The U.S. pullout could strengthen hardliners in Iranian politics at the expense of moderates like Rouhani who had pinned their hopes on the deal to boost living standards in Iran, with limited success so far. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a hardliner, said: “Mr Trump, I tell you on behalf of the Iranian people: You’ve made a mistake. ... I said many times from the first day: Don’t trust America.”  Le Drian, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) all said Iran was honouring its commitments under the accord. “The region deserves better than further destabilisation provoked by American withdrawal,” Le Drian said. Later on Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis sought to allay concerns that Washington had alienated itself from close allies with Trump’s decision. “The president could not affirm as required that this agreement was being lived up to,” Mattis told a U.S. Senate hearing. “We now have the opportunity to move forward to address those shortcomings and make it more compelling.” The European Union said it would ensure sanctions on Iran remain lifted, as long as Tehran meets its commitments. The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin was “deeply concerned” by the withdrawal, the RIA news agency said. Merkel said that while the existing deal should not be called into question, there should be discussion of “a broader deal that goes beyond it”. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson spoke of a “follow-on agreement,” but said it was up to Washington to come up with concrete proposals. Macron said he wanted a broader discussion with all relevant parties on the development of Iran’s nuclear programme after 2025, when key elements of the current deal start to expire, as well as Iran’s ballistic missile programme and wider Middle East issues. Iranian officials will next week meet counterparts from France, Britain and Germany. Khamenei appeared sceptical whether they could deliver: “I don’t trust these three countries.” The chances of saving the deal without Washington depend largely on whether international firms are willing and able to keep trading with Iran despite the threat of U.S. sanctions. In a sign of what may be in store, Trump’s ambassador to Berlin tweeted within hours of taking up his post that German businesses should halt activities in Iran at once. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the United States should not consider itself the world’s “economic policeman”. Britain, France and Germany said they would do all they could to protect their business interests in Iran, yet it was unclear how much they can shield firms from U.S. sanctions.   Brussels has a “blocking statute” at its disposal that bans any EU company from complying with U.S. sanctions and does not recognise any court rulings that enforce American penalties. But the statute has never been used and is seen by European governments more as a political weapon than a regulation, because its rules are vague and difficult to enforce. British Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman made the limits of potential action clear: “UK businesses may wish to consider the implications for their business activities in Iran and, where necessary, seek appropriate legal advice.” European companies including carmaker PSA (PEUP.PA), plane manufacturer Airbus (AIR.PA) and engineering group Siemens (SIEGn.DE) all said they were watching the situation. A senior French diplomat said businesses would ultimately be forced to choose between their Iranian economic interests and their potential U.S. interests, adding: “Generally, that decision is quickly made in favour of the U.S.” Hardliner lawmakers in Iran’s parliament burned a U.S. flag and a symbolic copy of the deal, known officially as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), chanting: “Death to America!”  Rouhani, who could be weakened by a blow to Iran’s economy, struck a more conciliatory tone in a televised speech, saying Iran would negotiate with EU countries, China and Russia. “If at the end of this short period, we conclude that we can fully benefit from the JCPOA with the cooperation of all countries, the deal will remain,” he said. The Trump administration kept the door open to negotiating another deal, but it is far from clear whether the Europeans would pursue that option or be able to win Iran over. Abandoning the pact was one of the most consequential decisions of Trump’s “America First” policy, which has led him to quit the global Paris climate accord, come close to a trade war with China and pull out of an Asian-Pacific trade deal.  Iran denies long-standing Western suspicions that it tried in the past to develop atomic weapons and says its nuclear energy program has been for peaceful purposes. Senior U.S. officials themselves have said several times that Iran is in technical compliance with the nuclear pact. Renewing sanctions would make it much harder for Iran to sell its oil abroad or use the international banking system.    Iran is the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’s third-largest member, pumping about 3.8 million barrels per day of crude, or just under 4 percent of global supply. China, India, Japan and South Korea buy most of its 2.5 million bpd of exports. Iran’s rial currency plunged to a record low against the U.S. dollar in the free market, after sliding for months because of a weak economy, financial difficulties at local banks and heavy demand for dollars among Iranians who feared that renewed U.S. sanctions would hit Iranian exports hard. Among the few nations to welcome Trump’s decision were Israel and Saudi Arabia, Iran’s arch-foes in the Middle East, regarding it as a political victory.

2018-05-10,"(Adds Citgo no comment) HOUSTON, May 9 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s state-run oil firm PDVSA is being sued for more than $25 million in the United States over nonpayment of notes issued for work performed by Canadian energy contractor SNC-Lavalin, according to a court filing. The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, is the latest in a series of legal filings seeking to press the cash-strapped oil company and its refining subsidiary for payment, with actions in recent days by U.S. oil producer ConocoPhillips and Canadian mining company Rusoro. PDVSA’s deteriorating infrastructure and declining oil export revenues have thrown Venezuela into a severe recession. The recent court actions have cut its ability to run oil storage, processing and blending facilities that feed its exports. The lawsuit was filed by White Beech SNC LLC, identified in the complaint as a Delaware corporation that this month received the PDVSA notes from SNC-Lavalin. White Beech’s attorney was not available for comment. White Beach SNC is not an affiliate of SNC-Lavalin, said Nicolas Ryan, spokesman for the Canadian engineering and construction company, declining to comment further. PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company is facing rising pressures from an inability to finance exploration and refining operations, contributing to a lack of spare parts for its oil and gas and refining operations. The OPEC member country’s crude exports in the first quarter fell 29 percent year-on-year to 1.19 million barrels per day, according to Thomson Reuters data. Oil service firms, including Schlumberger NV, Baker Hughes, a GE company, and Weatherford International PLC , have reduced operations in the country due to a lack of payments. “It’s pretty hard getting paid in Venezuela,” Christian Brown, president of SNC-Lavalin’s oil and gas business, said in an interview at a Houston energy conference. “We’ve done no work recently in Venezuela.” Conoco this month sought to attach PDVSA oil inventories and other assets to collect on a $2 billion arbitration award, crimping the South American company’s oil storage and export operations in the Caribbean. Rusoro also filed in a New York court seeking to attach assets of PDVSA’s Citgo Petroleum as payment for a $1.2 billion arbitration award. Citgo declined to comment. The case is White Beech SNC vs Petroleos de Venezuela, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 1:18-cv-4148.
