2018-04-20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. bond sell-off continued for a second day on Friday, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield to its highest level in more than four years and steepening the yield curve after two weeks of flattening. World stock markets dipped as worries about a global slowdown in smartphone demand dented the technology sector, while oil prices fell after U.S. President Donald Trump sent a tweet criticizing OPEC and then mostly recovered. The higher yields seemed to reflect a technical shift in the market, rather than a jump in investor confidence in the U.S. economy or rising inflation, so analysts are regarding the steeper curve as temporary. “If you look at the chart, you have to squint to see it,” Gene Tannuzzo, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, said of the two-day counter-trend. With the Federal Reserve raising short-term interest rates, “a flattening makes sense,” Tannuzzo added. Benchmark 10-year notes touched 2.962 percent, surpassing their January 2014 levels. They last fell 13/32 in price to yield 2.9602 percent. “Investors want to wait on the sidelines. It seems like the 10-year will get to 3 percent. Everybody’s being patient so they can see how far it corrects until we get there,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. U.S. crude fell 0.4 percent to $68.06 per barrel and Brent was last at $73.66, down 0.16 percent on the day. Oil prices have been supported by tightening crude supplies and continued support from OPEC and its allies on supply cuts.  Trump’s tweet, in which he called prices “artificially Very High!”, sent crude futures tumbling, but they stabilized a bit later. [O/R] “We have a difficult time seeing how OPEC would in any way be swayed here in terms of changing course, in terms of policy,” said Michael Tran, commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “One of the major variables that’s fuelling the rally in oil prices is the market’s perception that his administration is taking an increasingly hawkish stance on foreign policy,” he said. Weakness among tech stocks drove Wall Street equities lower for a second session, following a slide on Thursday by Apple Inc and its suppliers.

2018-04-20,"ABIDJAN (Reuters) - The IMF will propose a financial arrangement to Congo Republic once the central African country has completed work needed to make its debt sustainable, the fund said on Friday, contradicting a claim by Congo that the deal was already done. Congo said on Friday it had fulfilled the criteria for a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and had reached an agreement on a three-year program aimed at turning around its debt-crippled economy. “The authorities and the IMF mission have reached broad understandings on a program that could be supported by the IMF under a financial arrangement,” an IMF spokesman said in response to emailed questions. “The Republic of Congo ... (is) working to restore debt sustainability and ensure full program financing. Once this work is completed, IMF Management will be prepared to propose the arrangement,” he added. Like other Central African oil producing countries, Congo has been hit by low crude prices. While several neighbors, including Chad and Gabon, have secured bailouts from the IMF, talks with Congo have dragged on since last year. The delay is largely due to the IMF’s call for the government to restructure its debt, which stood at $9.14 billion, or around 110 percent of GDP, by the end of July - a level the Fund says is unsustainable. “Republic of Congo congratulates itself for having met all of the criteria to be eligible for financing of its economic and financial program by the IMF and its international partners,” Congo had earlier said. It said the program, which still required IMF board approval, aimed to restore sustainable and inclusive economic growth and support a “stable microeconomic environment compatible with the viability of the public debt”. The statement did not give the expected size of the IMF package, but it said that conclusion of the program would unlock an additional 135 million euros ($166 million) from France.  The IMF said in a statement on Thursday that it expected Congo to continue implementing its strategy to restore debt sustainability and would propose a program to the board “once compliance with all relevant IMF policies has been established”. Congolese authorities are in talks with creditors, including trading houses Trafigura and Glencore (GLEN.L) from whom it borrowing $2 billion.  The bulk of its external debt, however, is owed to Chinese entities.

2018-04-20,"YEREVAN (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Armenian opposition supporters rallied on Friday for an eighth consecutive day against the appointment of ex-president Serzh Sarksyan as the new prime minister and  demanded an early parliamentary election. Parliament voted on Tuesday to allow Sarksyan, who had served as president of the small ex-Soviet republic from 2008 until this month, to become premier, in a job switch his opponents say show he is clinging to power. Under a revised constitution approved by referendum in 2015, the prime minister now has most power in Armenia while the presidency has become largely ceremonial. A Sarksyan ally, Armen Sarkissan, was sworn in as president last week after being elected by the parliament. The opposition activists marched through the capital Yerevan on Friday, waving national flags and chanting: “Make a stand, say no to Serzh.” They blocked several streets in the centre and staged sit-ins. Police detained about 200 activists. “Serzh Sarksyan should resign ... An early parliamentary election should be held in the country,” Nikol Pashinyan, one of the opposition leaders, told a crowd of more than 30,000 people. He said the opposition was ready to discuss such a plan with the ruling Republican Party after President Sarkissian on Thursday called for dialogue. “There is no intention to use force (against the protesters), but the atmosphere of permissiveness can not prevail in the country,” Sarksyan told independent Armenian Shant TV late on Thursday. Armenia seceded from the Soviet Union in 1991 but remains dependent on Russia for aid and investment. Many Armenians accuse the government of corruption and mishandling an economy that has struggled to overcome the legacy of central planning.

2018-04-20,"WASHINGTON/JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump accused OPEC on Friday of “artificially” boosting oil prices, drawing rebukes from some of the world’s top energy exporters. “Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea. Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!” Trump wrote on Twitter. It was unclear what triggered the tweet, Trump’s first mention of OPEC on social media during his term. U.S. oil prices are near a three-year high, at close to $70 a barrel, and have been rising since OPEC and non-OPEC producers including Russia cut supply in January 2017 to end a global oil glut and price collapse.  Trump’s tweet came shortly after officials from top oil exporter Saudi Arabia said they would like to see prices climb even higher and that they were still far from their goal of ending the supply glut.  The cartel is expected to restrain supply through the end of this year, and possibly into 2019. Three Saudi officials told Reuters this week they would be happy to see oil hit $80 or $100 a barrel. Higher prices drive up gasoline prices for motorists worldwide and rising energy costs feed inflation. But higher oil prices have also benefitted the U.S. energy industry, feeding rapid growth in output from shale fields. U.S. oil output is at record levels. Despite Trump’s comments, oil benchmarks ended the day modestly higher, rebounding from early losses.  Several members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries responded to the tweet, saying prices were not artificially inflated.  Delegates at an OPEC/non-OPEC monitoring committee meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia said oil prices were higher partially because of global political tensions, mentioning sanctions on Venezuela, threats to the Iran nuclear agreement, strikes on Syria and sabre-rattling over North Korea. OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo said the output cut agreement halted the collapse in global oil prices, and is “on course to restore stability on a sustainable basis in the interest of producers, consumers and the global economy.” “We don’t have any price objective in OPEC, and not in this joint endeavour with non-OPEC,” Barkindo said on Friday, in response to Trump’s tweet. The group is next slated to meet in June to discuss output policy. Ministers from both Iraq and the United Arab Emirates also disagreed with Trump on Friday, with Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi saying prices are “not very high” and that the market is stabilizing. Trump gave no details on what action his administration might take regarding oil or OPEC, and the White House did not respond to elaborate on the issue on the record.  “We have a difficult time seeing how OPEC would in any way be swayed here in terms of changing course, in terms of policy,” said Michael Tran, commodity strategist at RBC. OPEC’s output fell in March to an 11-month low, according to a Reuters survey. The cartel has targeted the five-year average of inventories in 35 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries as a barometer for the deal’s success. As of mid-April, those inventories were 2.85 billion barrels, or 43 million more than the five-year average; a year ago, it was 268 million barrels above that benchmark. This week, crude futures benchmarks Brent LCOc1 and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) CLc1 hit their highest since November 2014, with Brent touching $74.75 and U.S. crude $69.56 per barrel.  [O/R] That has raised fuel costs, with average U.S. prices for gasoline hitting $2.75 a gallon on Wednesday, according to motorist advocacy group AAA, up more than 30 cents from a year earlier and at their highest since July 2015.  Trump is “just trying to relate to his base when it comes to the retail gasoline prices, so he’s blaming OPEC for this,” said Josh Graves, senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago.     Beyond OPEC’s supply management, crude prices have been supported by expectations that Washington will re-introduce sanctions on OPEC-member Iran, and might expand sanctions against Venezuela after that country’s presidential election next month.  “If one concern about reinstating sanctions on Iranian oil is the impact that it could have on oil prices, then it could be a preemptive measure to blame OPEC instead,” said Antoine Halff, senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. Hedge funds and other speculators hold a record level of bullish bets on Brent, on expectations of further price rises. The U.S. government cannot legally influence oil prices other than through releasing oil from its strategic reserve which it does occasionally.  This year’s budget agreement includes the sale of about 100 million barrels of crude oil - about 15 percent of the reserve - as U.S. oil production recently hit a record at more than 10 million barrels a day. That release is not related to high oil prices, and analysts said it signalled Washington was not concerned about the potential for future global shortages. “Washington has fully given up this idea of scarcity. You don’t get to the point of selling your strategic reserves to balance your budget if you think the world is short,” said Kevin Book, managing director at Clearview Energy Partners.

2018-04-20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up on Friday, stabilizing after an earlier slide driven by U.S. President Donald Trump’s criticism of OPEC’s role in pushing up global oil prices.   Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 gained 28 cents, or 0.4 percent, to settle at $74.06 per barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude futures CLc2 for delivery in June, the most active U.S. contract, were up 7 cents at $68.40. The May WTI contract, which expired on Friday, CLc1 gained 9 cents, or 0.1 percent, to settle at $68.38. “Looks like OPEC is at it again,” Trump tweeted. “With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!”  Since early 2017, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies have curbed output in the hopes of eliminating a global oil glut.  Prices held up, even under Trump’s comments, said Walter Zimmerman, chief technical analyst at United-ICAP.   “Oil looks like it wants to explore the upside a little more,” Zimmerman said. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said that the organisation does not have a price objective, but that it is working to restore stability to oil markets.  Earlier this week, both Brent and WTI hit their highest levels since November 2014, at $74.75 and $69.56 per barrel respectively, buoyed by geopolitical risk and a tightening market. For the week, both benchmarks gained over 1 percent. “The only thing [Trump] can really do is drain the SPR (Strategic Petroleum Reserve). Now, I have not seen any indication that the administration plans on doing that,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York.  If Trump does start discussing the possibility of draining the strategic petroleum reserves, or SPR, that would pressure prices, Yawger said. “We have a difficult time seeing how OPEC would in any way be swayed here in terms of changing course, in terms of policy,” said Michael Tran, commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets.  Trump has recently been a bullish factor for oil, Tran said.  “One of the major variables that’s fuelling the rally in oil prices is the market’s perception that his administration is taking an increasingly hawkish stance on foreign policy,” he said.  The United States has until May 12 to decide whether it will leave the Iran nuclear deal, which would further tighten global supplies.

A U.S. bond selloff continued for a second day, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield to its highest level in more than four years and steepening the yield curve after two weeks of flattening. “Looks like OPEC is at it again,” Trump tweeted, saying oil prices were “artificially Very High!

Shares in Europe turned steady and were on track for a fourth week of gains. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.05 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.97 percent. The recent surge in oil prices to their highest for more than three years supported bond yields across the euro zone. Higher oil prices tend to fuel inflation, leading to tighter monetary policy and higher rates. U.S. yields also rose, with the 10-year Treasury hitting 2.958 percent, the highest since January 2014. “It’s slowly creeping closer to 3 percent, so the 10-year from a technical standpoint will show up on people’s radar,” said Ryan Larson, head of U.S. equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management in Chicago. Dovish remarks overnight from Bank of England Governor Mark Carney weakened sterling and helped the FTSE 100 index advance. It was last up 0.54 percent. Sterling continued to fall against the dollar, hitting its lowest against the greenback since April 6. Expectations of a British interest rate increase in May have shrunk.

2018-04-20,"SAN CRISTOBAL/MARACAIBO, Venezuela, April 20, Reuters - M ultiple daily power outages are on the increase in several cities in western Venezuela, despite the supposed end of state-sanctioned electricity rationing, people who live in the area say. Electricity supply problems have long been on the rise in Venezuela and are notably worse in the first few months of the year, when there is little rainfall and reservoirs lack the flow to power hydraulic plants. Critics blame inept management and maintenance, too, saying that has also impacted Venezuela’s cash cow, state oil company PDVSA. The OPEC country is undergoing a major economic and social crisis, with millions suffering food shortages amid soaring inflation. State electricity company Corpoelec, which originally ordered rationing in March following a drought, lifted the measure last week. “There was a six-hour blackout on the day the minister said that rationing was suspended!” said Nelly Moreno, a 32-year-old nursing assistant, as she waited for power to return to her home in San Cristobal, a city near Venezuela’s border with Colombia. Electricity minister Luis Motta blamed sabotage and asked people to report suspicious activity. President Nicolas Maduro, who is gearing up for presidential elections in a month’s time, often points to sabotage for the country’s ills. He blames Venezuela’s economic woes on a war that he says is being waged against his government by the United States and the opposition. “We live with uncertainty. We have no idea what time they are going to cut the power today,” said Yoselin Cote, a 31-year-old homemaker who lives in a poor neighborhood of San Cristobal.

2018-04-20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) said on Friday it was still considering a potential breakup of the 126-year-old industrial conglomerate, but such a move was secondary to running its businesses better. Boston-based GE is divesting about $20 billion in assets in an effort to reduce costs and boost profits as part of a three-year restructuring plan under Chief Executive Officer John Flannery, who took over Aug. 1.  The company on Friday reported adjusted earnings that beat expectations, sending shares higher, though some analysts saw GE’s relatively weak unadjusted results as more telling. Asked about a potential break-up, Flannery said the company is considering all options, but is focused on ensuring the businesses perform well.  “There’s no sacred cows,” he said on a conference call with analysts. “We are reviewing a number of structures. We are working through this right now in great detail with the board.” He promised investors an update “in the next couple of months.” GE shareholders are due to vote on board members next week.  GE said on Friday it had decided to sell its distributed power business and may be able to announce a deal by mid-year, confirming an earlier Reuters report. The business, which includes GE’s Jenbacher and Waukesha lines of reciprocating gas engines, is attracting strong interest from potential buyers, GE said. Reuters reported in February that GE was considering a sale of the business, which could be worth $2 billion. Separately, GE was exploring merging its transportation business, which makes locomotives, with Wabtec Corp (WAB.N), a U.S. maker of equipment for the rail industry, a person familiar with the matter said. GE is considering the deal as one of several alternatives for the transportation business, including a potential spin-off, and no decision has been taken, the source said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential discussions. GE and Wabtec did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Bloomberg News first reported on the talks.

2018-04-20,"* Trump tells OPEC oil has rallied too far * Confused OPEC ministers say they helped U.S. oil industry * Trump Iranian, Saudi policies in focus By Rania El Gamal, Alex Lawler and Dmitry Zhdannikov JEDDAH/LONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - With oil prices hitting $75 per barrel, it was meant to be one of the smoothest meetings OPEC has had in recent years. The night before the meeting, the ministers gathered in Jeddah celebrated with a traditional Saudi sword dance - just as U.S. President Donald Trump had done when he visited Saudi Arabia last May. Little did they know that Trump was about to spoil their post-meeting party when he tweeted that oil prices had rallied too far. “Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea. Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!” Trump said on Twitter. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is in the midst of an oil supply-cutting deal with non-OPEC producers like Russia that has helped erase a global glut and boosted oil prices to their highest since 2014. Oil prices fell on Trump’s tweet as market analysts tried to interpret what it could mean for U.S. policies. Ministers and delegates were having lunch at the time, to celebrate OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo’s birthday, when delegates were alerted to Trump’s tweet. “We in OPEC pride ourselves as friends of the United States,” Barkindo told reporters when emerging from the lunch and asked for his response to the tweet. An OPEC source said delegates were confused by Trump’s stance: “Higher oil prices helped the U.S. oil industry and the Americans themselves. The U.S. oil industry would have collapsed if it wasn’t for this OPEC deal”. UAE’s Energy Minister Suhail Mohamed al-Mazrouei said prices were not artificially high. Asked whether he thought it was fair that the U.S. president was getting involved in OPEC matters, he said jokingly: “Since when is it about fairness?” Trump, a regular twitter user, has never tweeted about OPEC before although he has regularly attacked cartels that control prices. The United States is on course to become the world’s largest oil producer but it has never participated in OPEC meetings due to tough anti-trust legislation. Reuters reported this week that Saudi Arabia would be happy to see crude rise even higher to $80 or even $100 a barrel, a sign Riyadh will seek no changes to the supply-cutting deal at a June meeting to set policy. Ole Hansen of Saxo Bank, said oil had risen to current levels in part because of the risk Trump might pull the U.S. out of an Iranian nuclear deal, thus curbing Iranian oil exports. Rapidan Energy thinktank said Trump’s tweet would initially push non-OPEC Russia and Saudi Arabia closer together and assist Riyadh’s attempts to prolong oil supply cuts. “But the intensifying clash will impact US-Saudi relations, Iran sanctions, US-Saudi discussions on civilian nuclear cooperation, and a host of other issues,” it added.

2018-04-20,"LONDON, April 20 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The dense smog of Delhi and the haze of Beijing cloud the sky as visitors sniff the air during a unique exhibition in London aimed at raising awareness of pollution. The new art installation allows people to experience different pollution levels using five domes that replicate the environments of the Indian, Chinese and British capitals, Brazil’s Sao Paulo and Norway’s Tautra peninsula. British artist Michael Pinsky, whose work often focuses on environmental issues, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation he wanted to make people stop and think about how their everyday actions impact the atmosphere. “The idea of polar bears on a melting glacier wasn’t something that makes people change their lifestyles. It’s the things that affect them every day,” Pinsky said in an interview at London’s Somerset House, where the pollution pods are on display. “(For) London, we’ve just focused entirely on diesel emissions because that’s the primary cause of pollution. It exceeds any other form of pollution.” The pods are climatically controlled and expose visitors to moderate levels of the different toxins, from nitrogen dioxide in London to ethanol in Sao Paulo. The Tautra dome contains the cleanest air. “You’re seeing a comparison between different cities, and you can feel it and see it as you move from dome to dome. I think it’s a really powerful way of bringing this (issue) to people’s minds,” said South African visitor Gillian Benjamin. Pinsky said the worst air quality was in the Delhi pod, reflecting the conditions of the Indian capital. If exposed to levels recreated in the artwork, residents in New Delhi would shorten their lifespans by four years, while those living in London would lose up to 16 months of their lives, he said. According to the World Health Organization, more than 92 percent of the world’s population live in places where air pollution levels exceed its safe limits. Nearly 9,500 residents of London die prematurely every year as a result of long-term exposure to air pollution, a 2015 study by researchers at King’s College London showed. Delhi’s state government has adopted anti-pollution measures in recent years, including limiting car use and temporarily closing coal-fired power plants. Last November, the city struggled with its worst pollution in nearly 20 years. Around a million children were forced to miss school as a result and thousands of workers reported illness. The “pollution pods” artwork is on display at Somerset House until April 25 and coincides with Earth Day on Sunday. (Additional reporting by Max Baring; Editing by Claire Cozens.

2018-04-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - Staff and investors in HSBC (HSBA.L) questioned its new bosses on Friday over how they will improve gender balance and ethnic diversity in senior management at a bank that only weeks ago reported the biggest gender pay gap among big British companies. Mark Tucker, the bank’s new chairman, and new chief executive John Flint faced questions from their own employees at the bank’s annual general meeting (AGM) in London over why so few women and people of colour are in its senior ranks. “I want to know specifically what HSBC is going to do to get people like myself sitting there [on the bank’s board], I want to come to this AGM and see a reflection of myself sitting there,” said Ololade Durodola, a black woman who works in HSBC’s retail banking division. Flint replied that the bank has committed to a target of increasing the ratio of women in senior management roles to 30 percent by 2020, from 26.5 percent today, but that it needs to do more on both diversity and gender balance. “Until our senior leadership is representative of the people we are serving, we are running a business risk,” Flint said. At board level, five of the HSBC’s 14 directors are women after the bank reduced the board from 17 members on Friday as part of efforts by Tucker to reduce bureaucracy and speed up decision-making. Europe’s biggest bank also faced questions on its funding of coal power plants in Asia after it unveiled a new energy policy on Friday that involves phasing out funding for fossil fuels. Shareolders queried HSBC on an exception it has made for coal-fired power plants in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam, which the bank said is a sensible short-term exception given the lack of alternative power sources in some parts of those countries. HSBC last month revealed it has a gender pay gap of 59 percent, the largest among British companies with more than 250 employees and caused by the lack of women in senior, better-paid roles. CEO Flint told reporters on the sidelines of the AGM that the bank has taken measures including a requirement for hiring shortlists to be gender-balanced but said the bank would stop short of choosing women for senior jobs because of their gender. “We have to create an environment where women can fulfil their potential, but if we start trying to put women into roles because they are women, we undermine this agenda,” Flint said. Durodola told Reuters after the meeting that she had confidence that Flint would try to tackle the problems of gender and ethnic balance in HSBC’s senior ranks but said she did not expect the problem to be fixed quickly. “There’s no Indian person, no African-American, no Afro-Caribbean on that board,” she said. “We need to look at diversity together. Flint’s been through the system, he’s been groomed with HSBC values so hopefully he’s a man of his word,” she said.

2018-04-20,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German prosecutors may widen an investigation into auto supplier Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL] over its suspected involvement in emissions test cheating to include dealings with Fiat (FCHA.MI), Ford (F.N), General Motors (GM.N) and Hyundai (005380.KS), according to the Stuttgart public prosecutor’s office. German weekly der Spiegel reported on Friday that the prosecutors suspect Bosch supplied those carmakers with illicit emissions control software. The prosecutor’s office confirmed it had launched preliminary inquiries in connection with Bosch and the four carmakers, but did not provide details. It has not launched any formal investigations on the matter, a spokesman for the office said. The prosecutor’s office launched an investigation over Bosch’s emissions dealings with Volkswagen (VW) (VOWG_p.DE) in 2015, when VW’s diesel test-cheating scandal in the United States broke.  It later started separate probes in relation to its suspected involvement in alleged emissions irregularities at Daimler (DAIGn.DE), VW’s premium unit Audi and Chyrsler. Bosch said it could not comment on the details of the investigations.  “We are taking accusations that diesel software was manipulated very seriously,” the company said in a statement, adding it was cooperating fully with the relevant authorities.

2018-04-20,"(Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) posted quarterly results that topped expectations on Friday, as earnings from aviation, healthcare and transportation offset weak power and oil-and-gas profits, sending shares sharply higher. GE affirmed its forecast for 2018 earnings and cash flow, and said it expects to book as much as $10 billion in proceeds from divesting industrial assets this year. Those comments eased concern that GE would post poor results.  GE’s profit reflected 7-percent revenue growth and vigorous cost cutting. Revenue rose in aviation, oil-and-gas and healthcare, offsetting declines in power, transportation, lighting and renewable energy. GE sliced $1 billion in costs, including $800 million in industrial structural costs. GE’s shares were up 3.8 percent to $14.52 on Thursday. The stock has lost more than half its value in the past last year. But GE also took a $1.5-billion reserve charge for potential costs associated with its discontinued WMC mortgage business, formerly part GE Capital.  The U.S. Department of Justice has been investigating the activities of GE’s former mortgage unit during the subprime mortgage crisis, since 2015. GE said settlement discussions with the DOJ in March and analysis of other banks’ reserves prompted it to take the charge, but it sees limited impact to results.  “We do not expect this to change our view on GE Capital with regards to cash and liquidity,” GE Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller said on a conference call with analysts.  Excluding adjustments, GE earned $369 million, or 4 cents a share, on revenue of $28.7 billion. That compared with 1 cent a share a year ago.  While several analysts thought GE handily beat forecasts, others cited the unadjusted earnings as being more telling. “I’m looking at it as coming in as expected,” analyst Jeff Windau at Edward Jones, said of the results and the adjustments. “And expectations were low.” JPMorgan analyst Steve Tusa was among those who said GE may cut its full-year earnings forecast in coming months. While results were “not that bad” compared with other quarters, Tusa said, negative free cash flow of $1.68 billion was weaker than he expected. GE typically reports negative cash flow early in the year as it spends on inventory shipped later in the year. GE earned an adjusted 16 cents per share, up from a restated 14 cents a share a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected 11 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. GE recently restated 2017 results to reflect changes in accounting standards. Analysts had forecast GE’s profit to decline in the first quarter and some thought Friday’s results might fail to meet even those diminished expectations. But the company’s aviation, transportation and healthcare businesses produced double-digit profit growth in the quarter, boosting overall results. Profit at GE’s power business fell 38 percent on a 9 percent decline in sales; orders dropped 29 percent.  “The industry continues to be challenging and is trending softer than our forecast,” GE said of the power business. Profit in GE’s oil and gas unit fell 30 percent, excluding restructuring and other charges, GE said.

2018-04-20,"KIGALI, April 20 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In the rainy season, water used to pour into Dativa Nyiramajyambere’s house on a cheap plot of land in the Kigali suburb of Rugenge. Outside her home, a half-metre-wide hole in the pavement gathered rubbish. But in 2009, Kigali’s leaders decided to start demolishing slums in the capital’s poor suburbs – those with little access to piped water or electricity – and replace them with new roads and homes. Nyiramajyambere, who had owned a small milk shop, was given a modest new home on the outskirts of the city. Families like hers also got compensation of $1,500-2,000 to help them settle in. The move was a first step in what has turned into an ambitious master plan to clean up Kigali – one that has led to the city being hailed as one of the greenest and cleanest in Africa. Earlier this year, at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, U.N. Environment Programme head Eric Solheim referred to Kigali as the “cleanest city on the planet”, both in terms of lack of rubbish on the streets and green initiatives. The accolade recognised a combination of government schemes that have made the Rwandan capital much tidier than before, but that also have spurred resistance from many displaced slumdwellers. The clean-up effort is in part a response to rapid growth in the capital, which has seen its population double since 1996, to about 1.3 million residents, many of them living in informal settlements, according to the municipal government. In 2013, municipal authorities drew up a master plan to improve the city’s environment while also trying to promote social inclusion, sustainable economic development and access to civic facilities. One focus was traffic congestion. To try to alleviate it, the Rwandan government spent $76 million to pave narrow streets, widen all main roads to dual carriageways, and improve signs. It also upgraded bus services between the suburbs and the city centre to encourage people to use public transport, said Bruno Rangira, a Kigali city spokesman, in an interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation. As well, the government committed nearly $40 million to relocate several dozen factories in a former wetlands industrial area to a newly established Special Economic Zone. It has also begun to remove nearly 2,100 smaller businesses – from motor repair shops to restaurants – that encroach on the city’s wetlands, with the goal of restoring the land to its natural state by 2020. Parfait Busabizwa, Kigali’s vice-mayor for economic development, told reporters in December that the city wants to create an artificial lake on reclaimed wetlands, for recreation and to protect against flooding, a worsening problem in the city as climate change brings more intense rainfall. Owners of businesses constructed illegally on wetlands are not being offered compensation, according to the Rwanda Environmental Management Authority and the ministry in charge of industries. But they will be given the chance to buy new land in a suburban area, where they will be given construction permits, Busabizwa said. Other legal businesses displaced by the cleanup effort are expected to receive compensation and help relocating by the end of 2019, using a nearly $30 million government fund, he said. Not all business owners are happy about the shift. Emile Murekezi, who saw his garage in Kinamba, a marshland suburb, closed and demolished in 2015, said he is now doing part-time jobs while waiting to find an appropriate place to relocate his shop. Shifting businesses could lead to “many people losing their jobs”, he said, as old clients disappear and finding new ones proves a struggle. Slum residents and landlords with property in central parts of the city also have objected to being relocated, usually to more distant areas. One goal of the changes in the city is to reach more people with services, but greener ones – such as biogas from sewage, Rangira said. Key contributors to Kigali’s green push are residents themselves who, like all Rwandan citizens, are required to perform a day of community work, called “umuganda”, once a month. In the capital, the long-established workdays focus on things like clearing land for community gardens, picking up rubbish, or helping to build new roads, classrooms or residential toilets for families that lack them. The city also is trying to set up trash collection sites in all suburban areas and is working with local businesses to install public toilets, Rangira said. In the meantime, Busabizwa said that Kigali, rather than relying primarily on fines to ensure cleanliness, is building awareness campaigns to promote a culture of hygiene. According to national government statistics, more than 90 percent of households in Kigali now have access to toilets and to clean water. The city also plans to create a new more than $300 million wastewater treatment plant by 2022 in Giti Cy’Inyoni, a suburb of Kigali, according to Giselle Umuhumuza, deputy managing director of the government’s Water and Sanitation Corporation. Teddy Kaberuka, a Kigali-based independent researcher on economic and development issues, said that clean-up efforts – from banning plastic bags to budgeting for city cleaning – have crucially been accompanied by efforts to persuade people of the benefits of the changes. Even more progress in winning backing for the green push could be made by creating more jobs for cleaners, rubbish collectors, and gardeners, he said. So far, the Rwanda Utility Regulatory Authority has granted nearly 200 licenses to cleaning services companies, which mostly hire women relocated from shanty towns, according to a 2017 report by the authority. Nyiramajyambere is one of them, having traded her job as an informal shop owner for one as a street cleaner – something she says has increased her income. “Thanks to the new job, I can now feed my family and my children are now going to schools,” she said.

While the MSCI index of global stock markets was down 0.91 percent on the day, it was still poised for its second week in the black after a strong start to the corporate earnings season. A robust earnings season could offset fears of slowing global growth and help stock markets recover from a turbulent first quarter which saw greater volatility, a trade spat between the United States and China, and increased geopolitical tensions in the Middle East over Syria. “While fundamentals remain robust, geopolitics and trade war fears, concerns over slowing global growth, and idiosyncratic issues in the tech sector have all weighed,” Deutsche Bank strategists wrote in note to clients, noting that a full-blown trade war between the U.S. and China was a major risk. “In equities we see the recent correction as overdone, and the first quarter earnings season could act as the needed circuit breaker.” Wall Street equities slid on weakness in energy stocks, dented by the falling oil prices, and a second session of limp tech stocks following a slide by Apple Inc and its suppliers on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 187.96 points, or 0.76 percent, to 24,476.93, the S&P 500 lost 19.45 points, or 0.72 percent, to 2,673.68 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 72.64 points, or 1 percent, to 7,165.42. Oil prices tanked after Trump said via Twitter that prices were “artificially very high” and “will not be accepted.” U.S. crude fell 0.42 percent to $68.00 per barrel and Brent was at $73.35, down 0.58 percent on the day. However, they were still set for a second consecutive week of gains, buoyed by tightening supplies and continued support from OPEC and its allies on supply cuts. The recent surge in oil prices to their highest for more than three years supported bond yields across the euro zone. Higher oil prices tend to push up inflation, which strengthens the case for tighter monetary policy and higher rates. Asian shares slipped as a warning from the world’s largest contract chipmaker knocked the tech sector. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.45 percent lower, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.13 percent. Emerging market stocks lost 1.52 percent. Shares in Europe fell 0.14 percent but were on track for a fourth week of gains. Dovish remarks overnight from Bank of England Governor Mark Carney weakened sterling and helped the FTSE 100 index advance. It was last up 0.35 percent. Sterling continued to fall against the dollar, hitting its lowest against the greenback since April 6. Expectations of a British interest rate increase in May have shrunk to 40 percent from 70 percent earlier this week. The dollar index, measured against a basket of peer currencies, rose 0.41 percent, with the euro down 0.54 percent to $1.2274. Spot gold dropped 0.5 percent to $1,338.84 an ounce.

Euro zone bond yields hit fresh highs on Friday and are now well above their levels at the start of the week after a sharp sell-off prompted by Brent crude prices hitting their highest in more than three years at $74.75 a barrel on Thursday. This prompted a tweet from U.S. President Donald Trump in which he said oil prices were “articifially very high” and “will not be accepted”. Higher oil prices tend to push up inflation, which strengthens the case for tighter monetary policy and higher interest rates. The yield on Germany’s 10-year government bond, the benchmark for the region, hit a five-week high of 0.613 percent and is about 10 basis points (bps) higher this week, having fallen in seven of the past 10 weeks. French and Dutch equivalents were also set for their biggest weekly rises in 10 weeks. “The market is hoping that higher oil prices will lead to higher inflation in a sustainable manner,” said DZ Bank strategist Sebastian Fellechner. “But this is hard to say because oil prices are only one factor; we need confirmation, we need to see other factors kick in, such as wage growth.” Still, a market gauge of long-term euro zone inflation expectations, the five-year five-year forward inflation-linked swap, was close to its highest level since mid-March, hit on Thursday at 1.6898 percent. The sell-off in bonds this week comes after a long stretch in which euro zone yields were kept compressed by factors including the possibility of a trade war between the United States and other major world economies, China in particular. As G20 policy meetings get under way, this is likely to be a major topic for discussion ahead of next week’s European Central Bank meeting, Commerzbank analysts said in a note. Japan has warned its G20 counterparts that protectionism and exchange of retaliatory measures will disrupt financial markets and heighten volatility. In a speech on Friday, ECB president Mario Draghi said the euro zone economy needs strong global growth and open trade if it is to continue to prosper. Large redemptions this month have also played a role in keeping yields lower, and this is set to continue next week with French coupon and redemptions alone worth 37.3 billion euros, the Commerzbank analysts said. Also on Friday British borrowing costs dropped after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney dampened expectations of a May increase to UK interest rates. The yield on 10-year Gilts was 3 bps lower while two-year Gilts were down 6 bps on the day. Later on Friday Moody’s is scheduled to review Portugal’s rating and market participants are looking to see if the Iberian country regains its third major investment grade rating. “For Portugal, we might get some small mechanical buying off the back of this,” said Rabo Bank rates strategist Lyn Graham-Taylor.

2018-04-20,"VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuania wants the United States to bring more defence systems such as long-range Patriot and short-range Avenger missiles to the Baltics where some fear Russia is more powerful in the air. The country has asked Washington to install the systems more regularly for exercises, arguing NATO needs to know the region well in case of conflict, Defence Minister Raimundas Karoblis told Reuters. “Yes, of course (we are asking)”, he told Reuters on Thursday. “We are talking not only about the Patriots but also other capabilities, such as short-range Avengers, and other systems to create a regional architecture of air defence, because we are not able to do that ourselves.” Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, once ruled from Moscow but now part of NATO and the European Union, need Western help despite growing defence budgets due to their small economies. Poland was equally alarmed by Moscow’s seizure of Crimea in 2014 and is spending more than $5 billion on buying Patriot missiles from Raytheon Co after a deal in March. Patriot missile defence interceptors are designed to detect, track and engage unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), cruise missiles and short-range or tactical ballistic missiles. But the small Baltic countries cannot afford costly military jets or advanced air defences, making them reliant on the United States and NATO to fill the gap.  From Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave on the Baltic Sea, any aircraft or missiles could reach most of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.  Karoblis did not expect NATO to increase defences in the Baltics immediately but he expects the alliance to show greater commitment at a NATO leaders summit in July to deterring any threat in the Baltics. One difficulty is that other NATO members face defence gaps after years of better ties with Russia following the end of the Cold War that made such defences unnecessary. “We would like to have the permanent deployment of ground missile systems and other capabilities, but we understand that a quite significant part of these capabilities were lost by NATO after the Cold War and it’s difficult to rebuild them fast”, he said. “We need to ensure that (air defences) could be deployed (in the Baltics) at any time necessary.” NATO began improving the region’s defences after Russia’s Crimea annexation, including putting four multinational battalions of about 1,000 troops to rotate in each Baltic state and Poland. But the alliance has shied away from deploying permanent military capabilities, partly to avoid escalating tension with Russia. The Kremlin says NATO, not Moscow, is the risk to peace in Europe. “The security situation (in the Baltics) is not improving,” said Karoblis, sitting in his ministry next to a painting depicting a Lithuanian cavalry battle with Russian Bolsheviks, almost a hundred years ago. “One of the places where (NATO) unity could be tested is the Baltic countries. This is, at least, a theoretic possibility”.

The Russian government said in a statement on Thursday that the gas processing complex, with a capacity of 8 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year, had been launched ahead of schedule. Lukoil has not revealed any data on gas exports to China from Uzbekistan. Lukoil also said on Thursday it has raised a $660 million loan to finance part of the cost of building the gas plant in Uzbekistan. Lukoil is working in the country under a production-sharing agreement that accounts for a quarter of all of Uzbekistan’s gas output. The company plans to double gas production in Uzbekistan to 16 bcm per year by 2020 from 8 bcm in 2017. Lukoil’s total gas output reached almost 33 bcm in 2017.

2018-04-20,"MOSCOW, April 20 (Reuters) - Russian gas giant Gazprom said on Friday it has lodged a claim to an international arbitration seeking to cancel its supply and transit contracts with Ukraine. It said talks with Kiev over the contracts had ended without concrete results and it had lodged a claim to a Stockholm arbitration court. The contracts are due to expire at the end of 2019. Last month Gazprom appealed against a previous Stockholm arbitration ruling, which obliged the Kremlin-controlled company to pay Ukraine’s Naftogaz $2.65 billion following a long dispute between the companies over gas delivery. Ukraine is a major transit country for Russian gas supplies to Europe where Gazprom accounts for around 35 percent of the gas market. Gazprom said last month it would terminate its gas contracts with Ukraine after it lost the court case, escalating a dispute which had left Ukraine struggling to stay warm and which the European Union said could threaten gas flows to Europe. Ukraine has not bought gas from Russia since November 2015 due to a broader political conflict between the two ex-Soviet countries following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine.

2018-04-20,"FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Investor Macquarie (MQG.AX) is interested in some assets of German energy firm Innogy (IGY.DE), two people familiar with the matter said, potentially disrupting plans by parent RWE (RWEG.DE) to break up the group with rival E.ON (EONGn.DE). The news comes about a month after RWE, which owns 76.8 percent in Innogy, unveiled plans to split up the unit and share its assets with E.ON in one of the sector’s most radical restructurings in recent history.     A rival bid for some of Innogy’s assets would give the group a stronger hand in negotiations with E.ON, the prospective future owner of its networks and retail units which has flagged as many as 5,000 job cuts as part of the deal. Macquarie and Innogy both declined to comment. RWE said it would continue with the proposed deal with E.ON, which it said offered shareholders and employees the best prospects. “Breaking up and selling Innogy in pieces is not an alternative for RWE,” it said in a statement.  A separate source said the assets Macquarie is eyeing are worth a low single-digit billion euro amount. It was not clear whether this includes offshore wind park project Triton Knoll, which sources say has also attracted Macquarie’s interest. Innogy earlier said it had received a request from a suitor it did not name, adding it had granted due diligence for its Czech activities. It said the suitor also expressed interest in certain parts of Innogy’s renewables, retail and networks units. “Discussions are at an early stage and at this point in time it is open whether and on what terms offers for individual business activities will be submitted,” Innogy said. Business paper Handelsblatt first reported Macquarie as the bidder. Shares in RWE and E.ON fell following the news and were down 1.65 percent and 1.2 percent respectively at 1514 GMT. Innogy shares were 0.4 percent lower at 37.76 euros, below the 40 euros E.ON will offer minority owners as part of the deal with RWE. With a regulated asset base of 1.7 billion euros ($2.1 billion), Innogy is the largest gas distribution networks operator in the Czech Republic and already shares ownership of that business with Macquarie, which holds just below 50 percent. Innogy also has 1.63 million power and gas customers in the country, about 7 percent of the group’s total. If Macquarie ends up buying some of Innogy’s assets it could mean the complex break-up plans by E.ON and RWE might have to be changed, said Thomas Hechtfischer, managing director of shareholder advisory group DSW. “What happens if the Innogy pie gets smaller and smaller? Everything has been calculated and valued. It certainly wouldn’t get any easier.” Additional reporting by Arno Schuetze; Editing by Maria Sheahan and Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/innogy-ma/update-3-german-utility-deal-faces-snag-as-macquarie-eyes-innogy-assets-sources-idUKL8N1RX23U,20 Apr 2018,"* RWE says selling Innogy in pieces is not an alternative

2018-04-20,"SARAJEVO, April 20 (Reuters) - The management board of Bosnia’s second largest power utility ERS have resigned over losses the company could not account for, the prime minister of Bosnia’s autonomous Serb region - where the utility is located - said on Friday. Zeljka Cvijanovic said ERS had recorded a loss in 2017 that couldn’t be “objectively explained,” though ERS has not yet officially published its 2017 business results, SRNA news agency reported. A meeting of ERS’s supervisory board is underway. Local media have reported the state-run utility suffered a loss of 47.8 million Bosnian marka ($30.3 million) due to suspicious power sale and purchase agreements, but no official was immediately available for comment. In 2016, ERS posted a profit of 5.2 million marka. A long drought and soaring temperatures lowered water levels across the Western Balkans last year, hitting hydro-power output and driving consumption and spot power prices sharply higher. Bosnia’s biggest power utility EPBiH’s said last week its 2017 net profit tumbled to 620,382 marka from nearly 13 million marka in 2016, as drought curbed its hydro generation and forced it turn to costly imports. ERS operates two coal-fired power plants with a combined capacity of 600 megawatts (MW) and three big and several small hydro power plants with a total capacity of 617 MW. Bosnia, normally the region’s only net power exporter, more than doubled power imports to 317 million marka last year to make up for the hydro-power shortfall, according to data from the state statistics agency.

2018-04-20,"(Recasts, updates throughout) By Fergus Jensen JAKARTA, April 20 (Reuters) - Pertamina has signed deals to take over rights to eight expiring oil field blocks previously held by firms including Chevron, CNOOC and Inpex, Indonesian energy ministry officials said on Friday. Earlier this week officials at the ministry said the transfer would “compensate” the state energy company for the dent to its profits from government fuel pricing policies. “We hope Pertamina can use the employees who worked for the previous operators (and) maintain output,” Oil and Gas Director General Djoko Siswanto said of the new agreements. Pertamina had committed to spending $556.5 million on developing the fields over the next three years, including for drilling, exploration and workovers, Siswanto told reporters. As of December, output from the blocks was at 68,599 barrels of oil equivalent of liquids and 306 million cubic feet per day of gas, upstream oil and gas regulator (SKKMigas) chief Amien Sunaryadhi said. Acting Pertamina chief executive Nicke Widyawati acknowledged the “government’s intentions” and said the additions would increase Pertamina’s profits. “We hope this will add to Pertamina’s ammunition to carry out its tasks for the state,” Widyawati told reporters. Indonesia this week enacted rules giving government control over all retail fuel prices, aiming to control inflation and boost consumers’ purchasing power. That follows a government promise in March not to hike fuel prices until after elections which are due in 2019. The moves, also aimed at shifting the burden of state-controlled prices away from the government, have further raised doubts over Jakarta’s commitment to reform and sent chills through energy investors. Highlighting Pertamina’s problems, its chief executive and four other directors were replaced on Friday, partly as a result of slower-than-hoped development of refineries. Pertamina, which holds a near monopoly on retail fuel sales in Indonesia, lost nearly 19 trillion rupiah ($1.4 billion) on government-priced fuel sales from January to September last year, crimping its spending capacity. But Pertamina would gain up to 9 trillion rupiah ($649 million) a year in revenues from the Mahakam block and the latest handover, for at least 20 years, Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Ignasius Jonan was quoted as saying by Dunia Energi earlier this week. “Compensation for maintaining fuel prices will come from upstream,” Jonan said. The Mahakam block was operated by French major Total up to 2017, when it was handed over to Pertamina after a more than seven-year tussle over rights to the resources. Contacted about the proposed “compensation” for Pertamina, a spokeswoman for Chevron and a Jakarta-based spokesman for Total declined to comment. A Tokyo-based spokesman for Inpex declined to comment on the handover decision, but said Inpex still hoped to work with Pertamina under a new contract in the Mahakam, where it believes there are still “substantial reserves.” Several sources working in the oil and gas sector questioned the benefit of the handover to Pertamina, as output from most of those fields had declined to levels deemed uneconomical by the original contractors. Komaidi Notonegoro, head of the Jakarta-based research group ReforMiner Institute, said the policy risked damaging investor confidence in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy. In future the government may overlook requests by upstream investors to extend expiring contracts, instead prioritising “compensation” for Pertamina, he said. And that meanes that “one by one, investors will leave.” ($1 = 13,875 rupiah) (Reporting by Jakarta bureau; Writing by Fergus Jensen; Editing by Tom Hogue and Alexander Smith)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/indonesia-pertamina-blocks/update-1-indonesia-compensates-pertamina-with-oil-block-handover-idUKL3N1RX4RG,20 Apr 2018,"Pertamina has

2018-04-20,"(Reuters) - Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) on Friday reported first-quarter profit that scraped past estimates, but the stock fell 1.3 percent on a drop in oil prices and a jump in costs for the oilfield services provider. Brent and U.S. crude turned negative after U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday criticized OPEC for output curbs that have helped raise global oil prices and said “artificially” high prices would not be accepted. U.S. and Brent crude were both down nearly 1 percent. [O/R] Schlumberger, a bellwether for the oilfield services and drilling industries, said global oil supply and demand were in balance and that investments in exploration and production were expected to rise about 5 percent internationally. The absence of normal seasonal softness indicated that supply and demand were in balance, and combined with “increased geopolitical risk” had driven up oil prices,” Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on a call with analysts.         Oilfield service companies have benefited from a jump in U.S crude prices CLc1 to around $67 a barrel but providers such as Schlumberger and Halliburton (HAL.N) had signaled to investors that freezing weather in parts of the United States and frack sand delivery delays would be a negative on first-quarter results.  Overcapacity in the pressure pumping market also dampened earnings. Kibsgaard warned that the shale industry could face production challenges from drilling wells too close together, leading to lower output per well, and as producers move to less optimal areas. Despite the headwinds, Schlumberger’s profit rose to $525 million, or 38 cents per share, in the quarter, from $279 million, or 20 cents, a year earlier. Excluding items, it earned 38 cents per share, beating analysts’ estimate of 37 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Schlumberger’s results were “fairly in line after expectations had already been tempered,” Capital One Securities analysts wrote in a note on Friday. Schlumberger expects to see growth in the North American pressure pumping market, but warned that its ability to raise prices would be constrained amid capacity additions.  The company anticipates add 1 million extra hydraulic horsepower this year, but deployed fewer frack fleets than anticipated in the quarter due to softer pricing and deployments by competitors.  Consultancy Rystad Energy estimates that some 3.3 million of hydraulic horsepower were added last year, and another 3.3 million will be added this year. Schlumberger revenue from North America soared nearly 52 percent to $2.84 billion. However, the total cost of manufacturing products and delivering services rose nearly 12 percent to $6.80 billion. Revenue from international operations, the company’s biggest segment, fell 0.8 percent to $4.88 billion. Total revenue rose to $7.83 billion from $6.89 billion. Revenue fell in Latin America on delays on a project in Ecuador and decreased activity in Argentina. Activity in Venezuela continued to decline. Shares of Schlumberger fell 92 cents at $69.37.

2018-04-20,"GENEVA/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq resumed paying Kuwait compensation on Friday for the destruction of Kuwaiti oil fields and facilities during the 1990-91 Gulf War, the United Nations said in Geneva in a prepared statement. The payment had been suspended since October 2014 because of security and budgetary problems the Iraqi government in its fight against Islamic State. “The United Nations Compensation Commission (UNCC) today made available $90 million to the Government of the State of Kuwait,” the U.N said. “With today’s payment, the Commission has paid out $47.9 billion, leaving approximately $4.5 billion remaining to be paid to the only outstanding claim.”  The sum owed, as well as the $90 million payment, goes towards an overall claim of $14.7 billion in damages by the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation , the largest approved by the Geneva-based commission, set up by the U.N. Security Council in 1991.  Payouts are made quarterly as funds become available.  The UNCC said in November that Baghdad should finish paying by the end of 2021 compensation for damages to states, companies and individuals caused by Iraq’s invasion and seven-month occupation of Kuwait under former president Saddam Hussein. Kuwait and Iraq agreed last year that payments would gradually increase from 0.5 percent of Iraqi oil proceeds in 2018 to 1.5 percent in 2019 and 3 percent in both 2020 and 2021.

2018-04-20,"(Reuters) - General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes posted quarterly profit that beat Wall Street estimates on Friday as improving oil prices prompted companies to ramp up oil and gas production.  U.S. crude futures climbed 7.5 percent in the first quarter of 2018, re-energizing oil and gas producers that held back investments in recent years amid a steep drop in prices. That boost has benefited service companies, among the hardest hit by the oil price downturn that started in mid-2014. “Market fundamentals remain supportive, as crude oil prices are relatively rangebound, providing stability to customers as they evaluate projects,” said Baker Hughes Chief Executive Officer Lorenzo Simonelli in a statement.  Excluding items, GE Baker Hughes earned 9 cents per share, beating analysts’ estimates by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to $5.40 billion from $5.32 billion on a combined basis a year earlier.  Results were boosted by a $124 million benefit from U.S. tax reform in December 2017.  Less than a year ago conglomerate General Electric Co combined its oilfield business with Baker Hughes, creating the second largest oilfield services company by revenue.  The combined company achieved $144 million in synergies in the first quarter of 2018, putting it on track to hit an expected $700 million by year-end, Simonelli said. Shares were up 0.8 percent at $33.99. Although the liquefied natural gas (LNG) and offshore markets were stagnant at the start of the year, the company was positive on both segments, Simonelli said.  So were investors. “We believe offshore and international markets have turned the corner and will soon become a more evident tailwind for the shares,” wrote James West, senior managing director for investment bank Evercore ISI in a note on Friday.  Oilfield services revenue, which accounted for half of overall sales, rose 10.1 percent to $2.64 billion in the quarter. The company was awarded a five-year contract by Kinder Morgan to provide artificial lift services in the Permian Basin as well as a wireline contract with a large international oil company in the Gulf of Mexico, it said. The company said on Friday it was awarded a subsea equipment contract for Phase II of Chevron’s project in Australia.  Net income attributable to the company was $70 million, or 17 cents per share, in the quarter. Orders rose 8.7 percent.

2018-04-20,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Merck KGaA will seek development partners for experimental treatments including tepotinib as the German company looks to licensing deals to help fund clinical trials, according to its head of drug R&D. Merck has a promising drug pipeline for the first time in several years. It is looking to take a collaborative approach, as an expected decline in operating profit this year forces it to find new ways to finance pharmaceutical development. Luciano Rossetti, its drug research and development chief, told Reuters the company was engaged in “very intense ongoing conversations” over deals to help fund trials of drugs in its pipeline. He said Merck was looking to strike agreements for treatments including oral lung cancer drug tepotinib as well as a so-called bifunctional fusion protein at an earlier stage of development, which aims to assist the immune system in fighting cancer cells.  Merck did not disclose the names of potential partners. Rossetti said the company was preparing to present initial Phase 2 trial data for tepotinib at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago in June which he expected would show the drug blocks a genetic mutation that drives tumor growth in certain lung cancer cases.  “What we expect from this high-precision approach is to have a high response rate in this patient population,” said Rossetti, adding that ASCO had the final word over whether the findings could be presented at the conference.  Bernstein analysts said in a March 21 note that tepotinib was the “one to watch” among Merck’s early and mid-stage pipeline drugs, and predicted 2030 sales of 530 million euros ($650 million). Licence partnership agreements, which typically see a drugmaker share the cost of trials with another pharma or biotech firm in return for a share of future sales, offer Merck a way to drive through a promising drug pipeline in as many disease types as possible. However such deals are double-edged; while they curb risk, they also curb earnings.  Merck, a diversified company that also has chemicals and lab equipment divisions, does not have the financial firepower in pharmaceuticals of the sector’s biggest players, including Roche, Pfizer, Novartis and Sanofi. This could prevent it challenging larger rivals in acquiring assets in a consolidating global market, analysts say.  Pharma majors often buy certain rights to experimental drugs from rivals or smaller biotech firms to bolster their pipeline. Selling rights, so-called outlicensing, is also common but is mainly driven by a desire to win partners in unfamiliar markets rather than financial constraints. Merck’s bifunctional fusion protein, which combines its approved cancer drug Bavencio’s immunotherapy mechanism with a second immune trigger, is in Phase 1 trials. Drugs typically go through three phases of testing before a market launch, but in cancer can be cut short to two when regulators see sufficient promise.  Merck, which started out 350 years ago as an apothecary shop in the German city of Darmstadt, sells products ranging from pearlescent pigments to dimmable window panes.  Healthcare - pharmaceuticals, allergy treatments and consumer health - accounted for 46 percent of its 15.3 billion euros of sales last year. Merck struck a deal this week to sell the consumer health unit to Procter & Gamble Co for 3.4 billion euros, but the company said this would not affect its plans to seek partners to help develop its pharma pipeline. The group is in a bind; just as it turned around its drug pipeline with promising candidates against arthritis and cancer, its finances have been squeezed by Chinese competition for its biggest cash generator - liquid crystals for TV screens.  This means it is lacking the money to take the drug candidates forward under its own steam. Its shares have fallen 21 percent over the past year, compared with an 8 percent decline in the European pharma index and a 3 percent gain in the European chemicals index. “Considering that Merck had next to no pipeline five years ago, they’ve built up something quite solid,” said Markus Manns, portfolio manager at Union Investment, which holds shares in the German company. “As an investor I wouldn’t want to take an earnings hit if Merck were to decide to go it alone in pharmaceuticals development.” He added many pharma and biotech players were eager to grab a slice of other companies’ promising new treatments, putting Merck in a “very comfortable position”.  Merck, when it flagged its collaborative approach to drug development last month, had highlighted evobrutinib, a so-called BTK inhibitor designed to block white blood cells from launching an immune response at healthy cells. It is in the second phase of testing. The drug’s potentially broad use in the fast-growing autoimmune market, including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and lupus, would attract prospective partners such as Abbvie and Roche, said Manns. Bernstein has identified Merck’s stock as a bargain due to low market expectations. “Merck KGaA’s pipeline is often overlooked by investors, rightly so given the lack of visibility and poor track record,” said analyst Wimal Kapadia. “Given most investors expect failure, the risk/reward is to the upside.” ($1 = 0.8112 euros) Editing by Pravin Char",https://uk.reuters.com/article/merck-pipeline/focus-germanys-merck-seeks-partners-for-cancer-and-immune-system-drugs-idUKL8N1RU5H3,20 Apr 2018,"* Merck needs development funding just as profit seen

2018-04-20,"(Adds details of release, background) OTTAWA, April 20 (Reuters) - Canada’s annual inflation rate in March edged up to 2.3 percent from 2.2 percent in February, the highest level in more than three years, in part due to costlier gasoline, Statistics Canada said on Friday. The annual rate - slightly less than the 2.4 percent forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll - was the most elevated since the 2.4 percent recorded in October 2014. The Bank of Canada, which maintains a 2.0 percent target for inflation, has raised interest rates three times since July 2017 amid a strengthening economy and near record low unemployment, and markets see an 80 percent chance of an increase by this July. The main contributor to the higher annual inflation rate in March was a 17.1 percent jump in gasoline prices. Seven of the eight major components increased on a year-over-year basis. The Bank of Canada’s three measures of core inflation were little changed. CPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy’s underperformance, remained at 1.9 percent. CPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, stayed at 2.1 percent, while CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, edged down to 2.0 percent from 2.1 percent.

2018-04-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shipping industry hopes that so-called sulphur scrubbers are a quick-fix solution to compliance with drastic emissions reduction demanded by 2020 are somewhat misguided, one of the world’s biggest manufacturers of the equipment told Reuters. The International Maritime Organization's (IMO) cut to the amount of sulphur the world's fleet can emit will have massive implications for shippers, oil refiners and even crude oil producers. [reut.rs/2HElqk2]     Scrubbers that strip sulphur as fuels are burned allows ships to continue using high-sulphur fuel oil, and Finland’s Wartsila Marine Solutions is taking in record orders as the 2020 deadline draws nearer. However, Sigurd Jenssen, the company’s director of exhaust gas cleaning, said that while the equipment has a major part to play, there is “no silver bullet” to ensure the deadline is met. “You can’t equip 20,000, 30,000, 40,000 ships ... in one year,” he said.  Wartsila installed 70-80 scrubbers last year, accounting for about a third of the market, and Jenssen said that fitting 2,000-3,000 ships with scrubbers by 2020 is “doable”. But with a global fleet of about 60,000 vessels travelling international routes, according to brokers Alphatanker, a large number will have to turn to cleaner fuels.  The International Energy Agency said on Wednesday that there has not been enough investment in scrubbers and it is worried about the market’s ability to meet demand for the low-sulphur marine fuel that will be needed by ships without scrubbers. The IMO rules cut the maximum amount of sulphur emissions to 0.5 percent from 3.5 percent, meaning that ships without scrubbers have to burn lower-sulphur fuels such as marine gasoil or ultra-low-sulphur fuel oil. Experts say this will cut fuel oil demand by anywhere from 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) to 3.5 million bpd. Jenssen said that 60 percent of new-build ships in Korea, a major ship-building hub, were fitted with scrubbers last year and that the market to retrofit existing vessels is “picking up quite rapidly”.  But at a cost of between 1 million euros and 5 million euros (876,228 pounds to 4.9 million pounds) for the equipment alone, Jenssen said some ship owners are holding back. “A lot of smaller players with less-strong balance sheets ... want to wait to see how the fuel market is moving as well,” he said.       Fitting a scrubber can take as little as 10-20 days but a bespoke engineering plan is also required and the entire process can take up to a year.  “The lead time on the equipment is somewhere between 7-9 months. But before you get to the point of ordering there’s some investigations and work to be done that can easily take a couple (more) months,” Jenssen said. As demand increases, that time frame could get longer, he added.

2018-04-20,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * World stocks dip as smartphone demand worries hit tech * MSCI All Country World Index set for second week of gains * Oil slides after Trump says prices are artificially high * Pound on back foot after dovish remarks from BoE’s Carney By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - World stocks dipped on Friday as worries about a global slowdown in smartphone demand dented the technology sector while oil prices fell after U.S. President Donald Trump said prices were artificially high. Down 0.3 percent on the day, the MSCI All Country World Index was on track for its second week in the black after a strong start to the corporate earnings season. But it has struggled to recover all of its losses since a violent selloff knocked it off a record high in February. A strong earnings season could offset fears of slowing global growth and help stock markets recover from a turbulent first quarter which saw a spike in volatility, increased trade tensions between the United States and China, and spiking geopolitical tensions in the Middle East over Syria. “While fundamentals remain robust, geopolitics and trade war fears, concerns over slowing global growth, and idiosyncratic issues in the tech sector have all weighed,” Deutsche Bank strategists wrote in note to clients, noting that a full-blown trade war between the U.S. and China was a major risk. “In equities we see the recent correction as overdone, and the first quarter earnings season could act as the needed circuit breaker.” Futures indicated a positive opening for Wall Street following strong earnings from industrial heavyweights General Electric and Honeywell. Oil prices fell after Trump tweeted that prices were “artificially very high” and “will not be accepted”. Brent crude futures slid more than half a percent to $73.32 per barrel while U.S. crude fell 0.7 percent to $67.82 per barrel. They were still set for a second consecutive week of gains, buoyed by tightening supplies and continued support from OPEC and its allies on supply cuts. The recent surge in oil prices to their highest for more than three years supported bond yields across the euro zone. Higher oil prices tend to push up inflation, which in turn strengthens the case for tighter monetary policy and higher rates. Earlier, in Asia, shares slipped as a warning from the world’s largest contract chipmaker knocked the tech sector. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing cut its revenue target to the low end of forecasts, blaming softer demand for smartphones. Shares in Apple Inc and its suppliers fell on Wall Street on Thursday, paving the way for Friday’s falls. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 1.1 percent, again led by a 1.6 percent fall in technology. Shares in Europe were down 0.2 percent, but remain up half a percent on the week and set for their fourth straight week of gains. Dovish remarks overnight from Bank of England Governor Mark Carney weakened the pound, helping the internationally exposed FTSE 100 index outperform with a gain of nearly half a percent. Sterling continued to fall against the dollar, hitting its lowest level against the greenback since April 6. Expectations of a UK interest rate increase in May has shrunk to about 40 percent from 70 percent earlier this week. In other currencies, the Swiss franc was slightly stronger against the euro after falling to a three-year low of 1.20 per euro on Thursday. That was past the level which was defended by the Swiss National Bank during the brief era of its currency peg with the euro, abandoned in January 2015. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of peer currencies, was up 0.2 percent. Spot gold was down 0.3 percent at $1,340.91 an ounce by 1153 GMT. Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho

2018-04-20,"TRIPOLI, April 20 (Reuters) - Libya will have to cover its 2018 grain consumption needs of around 1.2 million tonnes almost entirely by imports but hopes to boost production from the next harvest with the help of the United Nations, a senior official said. Abdelmoneim Mohamed Shihab ad-Din, the top official in the agricultural ministry in a U.N.-backed government in Tripoli, said the oil producing nation could meet at least half of its cereal needs in future, if security and power supply improved. To ramp up output, Libya will invest $120 million into its farming sector under a programme with the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), of which more than $10 million will go on seeds for 1,200 farmers, he said. “This year it will be the same (with imports meeting consumption) but if the security improves a bit then output will improve the next (2018) season,” ad-Din said in an interview. “Electricity supply has improved. We can reach 50 percent (of 1.2 million tonnes of grain consumption),” he said, when asked where output could be in the next two years. He said last year’s crop output was around 100,000 tonnes, though no exact figures exist due to the dysfunctional Libyan state, in turmoil since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Farmers have been struggling to get seeds as a fall in oil revenues since 2011 has hit the supply of foreign exchange needed to fund imports. Improving output would not just lower the import bill of a country suffering from economic meltdown but also provide an income in poor rural areas, often cut off from state support due to poor security, and African migrants working as farmhands. But much will depend on whether security improves. The focus of the plan is on the main farming regions deep in the south in Ubari and Sebha, which were hit by tribal fighting and lack of power supply, as well as Benghazi in the east. Libya, a country of six million, was once home to large-scale farming schemes built by Italian colonial rulers, but has neglected the sector since oil exports started in the 1960s. Still, the country produced up to 450,000 tonnes of cereal until 2011, officials said. Since then, crop output has been hovering around 100,000 tonnes. An FAO study showed seeds and modern equipment had become unavailable in many parts of Libya. Development has also been hampered by a split between two governments - the Tripoli one and an eastern rival, though ad-Din said his ministry was cooperating on a technical level with the east, allowing it to ship seeds to Benghazi. Libya also produces some 120,000 tonnes of dates, some of which still get exported despite the chaos, alongside cooking oil and strawberries grown in the more stable north of the country, officials said. “It’s a difficult situation but we are more optimistic now,” ad-Din said. “But we need more foreign assistance.” (Editing by Mark Potter)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/libya-wheat/interview-libya-to-cover-2018-grain-needs-with-imports-eyes-higher-harvest-idUKL8N1RW7HN,20 Apr 2018,"Libya will have to cover its

The process is being run by Citigroup and bids are expected to be finalized in July, according to one of the sources. New York-based Yorktown Partners and Houston-headquartered Merlon did not respond to requests for comment by email and phone. Citi declined to comment. Merlon produced around 7,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2017 from more than 50 wells in the El Fayum region, 80 kilometres (50 miles) south of Cairo, according to its website. El Fayum has estimated recoverable resources of 125-150 million barrels and had produced around 18 million barrels by the end of last year. The development concession was awarded in 2004 and the lease could be extended until 2040. Interest in Egypt’s oil and gas sector has risen in recent years following a number of large gas offshore discoveries and economic reforms in the country.

2018-04-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - Europe’s largest bank HSBC (HSBA.L)(0005.HK) said on Friday it would mostly stop funding new coal power plants, oil sands and arctic drilling, becoming the latest in a long line of investors to shun the fossil fuels. Other large banks such as ING and BNP Paribas have made similar pledges in recent months as investors have mounted pressure to make sure bank’s actions align with the Paris Agreement, a global pact to limit greenhouse gas emissions and curb rising temperatures.  “We recognise the need to reduce emissions rapidly to achieve the target set in the 2015 Paris Agreement... and our responsibility to support the communities in which we operate,” Daniel Klier, group head of strategy and global head of sustainable finance, said in a statement. HSBC said it would make an exception for coal-fired power plants in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam. “There’s a very significant number of people in those three countries who have no access to any electricity,” HSBC CEO John Flint told HSBC shareholders at the bank’s annual general meeting in London on Friday. “The reasonable position for us is to allow a short window for us to continue to get involved in financing coal there... if we think there is not a reasonable alternative,” he said. Aside from the coal exemptions environmental campaigners Greenpeace welcomed the move and said HSBC’s new energy strategy would prevent it from providing project finance for TransCanada Corp’s (TRP.TO) proposed $8 billion Keystone XL oil pipeline to Nebraska. “This latest vote of no-confidence from a major financial institution shows that tar sands are becoming an increasingly toxic business proposition,” John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK said in a statement.

2018-04-20,"JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers could begin easing up on output curbs before the end of the year, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Friday, sounding a bearish tone in contrast to Saudi Arabia’s bullish stance. Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC players led by Russia have reduced output by 1.8 million barrels per day since January 2017 under a deal set to run until the end of this year. The deal has helped raise oil prices to above $74 a barrel, the highest since November 2014, and reduce inventories in OECD industrialised countries almost back to their five-year moving average.   The Joint OPEC/Non-OPEC Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC), which monitors the deal, met on Friday in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, ahead of an OPEC-led meeting set for Vienna in June. “The agreement lasts until the end of the year. In June, we can discuss, among other issues, a question about reduction of some quotas during this time, if it is expedient from the market’s point of view,” Novak said ahead of the JMMC meeting, TASS news agency reported. Still, sources familiar with the meeting told Reuters that Novak told his OPEC and non-OPEC counterparts in a closed-door meeting that Moscow was committed to the deal on cutting output until the end of 2018. The OPEC, non-OPEC ministerial panel said OECD commercial oil stock levels were 2.83 billion bbl in March 2018, still above the level seen before the oil market downturn. The panel tasked OPEC’s Secretariat to look into different metrics with deep analysis of market uncertainties. Saudi Arabia would be happy to see crude rise to $80 or even $100 a barrel, three industry sources said this week, indicating Riyadh will likely seek no changes to the deal in June. Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said OPEC and non-OPEC compliance with the output deal reached 149 percent in March. The deal’s success has helped relations between Russia and Saudi Arabia. Saudi King Salman made a royal visit to Moscow last year.

2018-04-20,"* Eight regions account for 42 pct of China’s power generation in 2017 * Some regions launched monthly, quarterly power markets last year (Adds detail) BEIJING, April 20 (Reuters) - China will launch its first real-time spot electricity markets in eight regions, the National Energy Administration (NEA) said on Friday, as Beijing accelerates efforts to liberalise power prices currently set by the government. In a draft rule, the NEA outlined guidelines for eight regions to set up real-time trading platforms that will set prices for the cash market as well as those for a day ahead, allowing power generators, industrial users and distributors to trade power in real time. The eight regions are Guangdong, western Inner Mongolia, Zhejiang, Shanxi, Shandong, Fujian, Sichuan and Gansu. Their power generation in 2017 was 2.6 trillion kilowatt-hours, 42 percent of China’s total. The move comes after those regions launched electricity markets last year for monthly and quarterly prices. China’s major utilities, including China Huadian Corp, China Datang Group, China State Grid Corp and the Three Gorges hydropower producer will be the biggest players in the market, the NEA statement said.

2018-04-20,"BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese authorities have barred senior staff at embattled Chinese conglomerate CEFC China Energy from travelling overseas amid a government investigation of the firm’s chairman, three sources briefed on the matter have told Reuters. The ban affects dozens of CEFC staff at the vice president-level and above, the people said. The exact timing of the ban is unclear. One of the sources said it has been in place since mid-February and another said it started last month. The three sources said they were briefed by company executives that attempted to travel overseas and were denied exit from China.  The Shanghai-based conglomerate, which grew from a niche oil trader to a $25 billion company, has faced increasing scrutiny after its chairman, Ye Jianming, was put under investigation for suspected economic crimes earlier this year. CEFC did not respond to multiple calls for requests for comment.  The sources could not indicate which government agency imposed the ban.  The Ministry of Public Safety did not respond to a request from Reuters for a comment on whether a travel ban has been imposed on the CEFC executives.  Chinese authorities sometimes put travel bans on top corporate executives without stating a reason, but it is unusual to impose a blanket ban on a number of company executives.  The travel ban is another measure that Chinese authorities are taking amid a crackdown on companies that have engaged in highly-leveraged financial deals and that hold large amounts of corporate debt. In February, the Chinese government seized control of Anbang Insurance Group Co Ltd and said its chairman had been prosecuted. Late on Thursday, Huarong Asset Management Co Ltd (2799.HK) said Lai Xiaomin, the company chairman, had stepped down following a Reuters report earlier this week that he was being investigated for suspected “serious discipline violations”, a euphemism for graft. Huarong’s shares fell more than 10 percent on Friday.  CEFC made a splash last year agreeing to buy a 14.16 percent stake in Russia’s Rosneft for $9.1 billion. CEFC was financing the deal through China Development bank and Russian bank VTB, who was set to provide a loan of 5 billion euros ($6.15 billion). The deal has not closed and remains uncertain after Ye’s investigation has highlighted financial difficulties at CEFC, mainly centred around large holdings of short-term debt.  Shanghai-based CEFC has around 44 billion yuan ($6.94 billion) of short-term borrowing due by the first half of 2018, according to its 2017 half-year financial report disclosed to onshore bondholders. Ahead of Ye’s investigation, CEFC was in talks with Chinese shadow lenders for short-tem loans with annual rates of as much as 36 percent to make up its cash shortfall, Reuters reported in March. In March, Guosheng Group, an investment firm owned by the Shanghai government, was tasked with evaluating CEFC’s financial position as part of a restructuring and takeover process, two sources told Reuters at the time. Reuters reported earlier this month that a creditor had taken legal action against CEFC, even as China Development Bank tried to dissuade lenders from taking action.

The country has four offshore wind parks that produce 871 megawatts of power and wants to increase that capacity to 2.2 gigawatts by 2020 and to 4 gigawatts by 2030. After 2020, the government plans to designate a new, 221-square-kilometre (85 square miles) area near French waters.  “Our North Sea is a crucial partner in the energy transition towards renewable energy which is happening in our country,” Belgian state secretary for the North Sea, Philippe De Backer, said in a statement. Belgium’s two nuclear power plants, at Doel and Tihange with a total capacity of 6 gigawatts, have experienced a series of technical problems at reactors and are earmarked for closure by 2025.

2018-04-20,"BEIJING (Reuters) - First-quarter revenue at CNOOC Ltd (0883.HK), the listed arm of China National Offshore Oil Co, rose 10.8 percent from a year earlier, largely due to a rebound in international oil prices. The revenues for the oil-and-gas group in the first three months rose to 42.54 billion yuan ($6.76 billion), the company said on Friday, marking the highest revenues for a first quarter since 2014. CNOOC did not disclose any profit figures. The rise in revenue came as global oil prices continue to rebound and the offshore oil-and-gas specialist produced more gas supported by rising domestic gas prices. CNOOC’s natural gas revenues rose more than 12 percent from a year ago to 4.5 billion yuan as realized gas sales prices rose 7.8 percent from the same period last year. Total crude oil production worldwide fell to 99 million barrels in the first quarter from 100 million barrels a year ago, mainly due to declines at domestic fields, a company statement showed. CNOOC’s capital spending rose to 9.66 billion yuan in the first three months, up more than 11 percent from the year earlier period, but it was down from record high level of around 19 billion yuan in the same period in 2014.

2018-04-20,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian inquiry into financial sector misconduct claimed its first scalp on Friday as the CEO of the country’s largest wealth manager stepped down over revelations of board-level deception and misappropriation of funds. The departure of AMP Ltd’s (AMP.AX) Craig Meller came as the government vowed to double prison terms for financial crimes, dramatically increase penalties and ramp up the investigative powers of the corporate regulator following shocking admissions of misconduct to the Royal Commission inquiry. Not only has the start of the year-long inquiry been a publicity disaster for Australia’s major lenders, it has also put the conservative government - which had initially opposed a commission despite years of scandals including rate-rigging and alleged money-laundering - in a tight spot. Faced with daily revelations of wrongdoing at the highest levels of corporate Australia, the government is now under mounting pressure to extend the inquiry beyond its February 2019 deadline, meaning it would run concurrently with the next federal election. Treasurer Scott Morrison, who once dismissed opposition calls for a Royal Commission as “crass populism”, on Friday said the government would raise criminal penalties for corporate crimes to a maximum of 10 years in jail, from 5 years currently.  Offending companies would face fines up to A$210 million  ($162 million), versus A$10 million now. Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) would get the power to intercept internal communications of companies if necessary, Morrison said. “They are not victimless crimes,” Morrison told a press conference. “We need to set the tone ... so people understand that misleading regulators about serious issues such as this is no victimless offence, and it won’t carry a victimless penalty.” The changes were the result of years of planning and were not a knee-jerk reaction to the inquiry, he said.  AMP executives admitted in testimony this week that the company had lied to the corporate watchdog for almost a decade to cover a practice of charging customers for services it did not provide. Chairman Catherine Brenner issued an unreserved apology for “misconduct and failures in regulatory disclosures in our advice business”, as she announced Meller’s exit along with a review of the company’s governance.  Government data prepared for the Royal Commission, which has the power to subpoena documents and compel top executives to testify in public, shows more than 80,000 consumers have been given bad advice by financial institutions over the past decade, costing them a total A$5 billion ($3.9 billion). This week’s hearings have been particularly brutal.  A nurse gave tearful testimony on Thursday about losing her home after taking advice from Westpac Banking Corp (WBC.AX), while lawyers presented evidence that Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX), the country’s biggest bank, knowingly charged dead clients for counsel for years. But the revelations about AMP for the first time showed direct board-level involvement in hiding misconduct from ASIC, leading to calls for the watchdog to play a far more aggressive role than it has in the past. The Australian Shareholders’ Association said Meller’s resignation was “not sufficient” and called for Brenner to explain the board’s involvement in the case or step down. The ASA “wants to ask Catherine Brenner about the reported interference with the production of the independent report”, it said in a statement. “If this is not able to be provided, her position as chair is untenable and she should resign,” said the ASA. “The ASA is having further discussions with the company to assess how rigorous these directors are in dealing with the ongoing issues,” it added. The association represented about 700 shareholders at the last AMP annual general meeting, the ASA website shows. AMP shares have lost over A$1.2 billion in market value since the revelations came to light on Tuesday. The stock ended down 0.5 percent on Friday, in a weak overall market . Meller said he was “personally devastated by the issues which have been raised publicly this week”, and while he did not condone making misleading statements to the regulator they had occurred under his watch so his resignation was appropriate. “This is not the AMP I know and these are not the actions our customers should expect from the company.”  AMP Director Mike Wilkins, a former CEO of Australia’s biggest general insurer, Insurance Australia Group Ltd (IAG.AX), will step in as AMP’s acting chief until a permanent replacement for Meller is found, the company added.

2018-04-20,"* Hengli to start trial runs at 400,000-bpd refinery in Oct * Plant aims to buy Saudi crude oil -sources * Hengli has applied for fuel export quota -sources * Could pose challenge to smaller independent plants (Adds analyst comment; source comment on domestic fuel marketing) By Meng Meng and Chen Aizhu BEIJING, April 20 (Reuters) - Chinese private chemical producer Hengli Group has won state approval to import 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) crude oil, the largest quota ever for a private refiner, as it challenges the country’s smaller independent plants in an oversupplied Chinese fuel market. The group’s listed unit Hengli Petrochemical said in an exchange filing late on Thursday that the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the state economic planner, had approved the quota. The firm aims to start trial runs in October at a newly built refinery in the northeastern port city of Dalian that will be among the five biggest refineries in China. “We will start using our quota this year,” said a senior Hengli official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorised to speak to the media. “We hope to get enough allowances for the refinery to start trial operations in October.” Another private chemical firm, Zhejiang Ronsheng Group, is also expected to start operating a new 400,000-bpd refinery in the eastern city of Zhoushan later this year. The additional production capacity in China is likely to add to pressure on the country’s small, independent, or “teapot”, refineries, which are vulnerable to increased competition because of their modest output. Many “teapot” refineries produce less than 100,000 bpd. “Hengli’s world-class scale, sophisticated refinery configuration that favors high-end petrochemicals and its location means it will be a killer competitor to teapots,” said Harry Liu of consultancy IHS Markit. With the government stepping up scrutiny over their tax and environmental practices, Liu predicted some of the smaller of the independents close in the next two years as a result of the competition. Hengli started as a small chemical fiber maker and operates a 6.6 million tonnes per year plant making purified terephthalic acid (PTA), the world’s largest. PTA is a feedstock for producing polyester. Although the NDRC grants approval for quotas, the Commerce Ministry determines how much of a quota can be put to use. “For next year, we are confident of getting 20 million tonnes of allowances from the government,” the senior Hengli official said. He said the refinery’s two crude distillation units (CDU) are designed to process 30 percent of Saudi Arabia’s Arab Medium crude, 60 percent of Saudi Heavy and 10 percent Qatar Marine crude. The company has recently applied for a quota to export fuel oil. The senior Hengli official and another company official said Hengli would market its refined fuel to state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina, as well as independent wholesalers and distributors. There is no near-term plan to build its own retailing network because of the cost. In January, Hengli signed a framework deal with state-run Sinochem Group to cooperate on imports of crude oil and the marketing of refined fuel.

2018-04-20,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian oil demand will hit a record in April just as global crude values are lifted to levels not seen in three years by Middle East supply risks and top exporter Saudi Arabia withholding output and noisily pushing for prices at $80 to $100 per barrel.  Most analysts have pointed to escalating Middle East conflicts, a crisis in Venezuela, and the supply cuts of Saudi Arabia and other producers as the main drivers taking global benchmark Brent LCOc1 and U.S. West Texas Intermediate CLc1 crude futures this week to their highest since late 2014 at almost $75 and $70 a barrel, respectively. Yet a much more fundamental reason has also sparked oil’s bull run: Asian demand, which Goldman Sachs said this week points to an average price of $80 a barrel in 2018.  “Rising tensions in the Middle East have likely played a role in oil price strength, but we believe a tight physical market is the key driver,” U.S. investment bank Jefferies said on Friday in a note to clients.  Trade data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows seaborne imports of crude oil by Asia’s main buyers will hit a record this month, a big portion going to slake China’s voracious thirst.  For graphic on Asia crude oil demand click reut.rs/2K2V89x By end-April, China will likely have taken in more than 9 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, its most ever. That’s nearly 10 percent of global consumption and more than a third of Asia’s overall demand. At $75 a barrel, it implies monthly import costs for China of more than $20 billion.  The record comes despite maintenance season, which usually dents imports at this time of year, and indicates that China’s oil requirement is bigger than expected.  “Chinese demand points to strong growth,” said U.S. bank Goldman Sachs in a note to clients, adding that it may be “higher than currently estimated”.  RE-STOCKING, TEAPOTS, RESERVES  Michal Meidan of consultancy Energy Aspects said Chinese buyers were re-stocking after running down inventories late last year.  Much of China’s new demand also comes from the advent of non-state refiners - often called teapots - as crude importers, resulting in record refining throughput.  “A number of teapots are starting new Crude Distillation Unites (CDUs) and secondary units, pulling in more crude,” Meidan said, adding that there may also be some purchases of Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPRs).  Beyond re-stocking and teapots, analysts said China’s economic performance has also been stronger than expected.  For graphic on Singapore refinery margins click reut.rs/2HdlpjO “Chinese growth of 6.8 percent in Q1 is higher than its target of 6.5 percent for the year. The supportive growth environment in China is one key reason for a supported oil demand story in general,” said Barnabas Gan, analyst at Singapore’s OCBC Bank.  Suresh Sivanandam of energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said he expected China’s overall oil demand to grow by 370,000 bpd this year to 12.78 million bpd.  Adding in other regions, Goldman said global oil demand in the first quarter of 2018 is likely to post the strongest year-on-year growth since the last quarter of 2010.  A tighter market is also showing up in rising costs for crude deliveries to Asia as Middle East producers raise their official selling prices (OSPs).  The OSPs for Abu Dhabi’s Murban and Saudi Arabia’s Light crudes are currently showing their highest premiums to Dubai since 2014.  With demand growing all around, some analysts say there is little reason to expect anything but further price increases.  Standard Chartered Bank said this week there were “no bears left in this oil town”.   So far, refineries in Asia are still operating at high levels to meet strong demand, despite rising crude feedstock prices eating into profit margins. “Refiners are not likely to reduce imports or trim down run rates despite the price increase,” said Lee Dal-seok, senior research fellow at state-run think tank Korea Energy Economics Institute. Still, some dark clouds loom.  China’s Sinopec (600028.SS), Asia’s largest refiner, plans deep cuts to its May crude imports as its biggest refinery - the 460,000 bpd Zhenhai Refining and Chemical Company - goes into major overhaul. Several traders said more such outages are due in May and June, likely reducing China’s crude imports in coming months.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) this week also released its World Economic Outlook in which it warned that rising U.S.-China trade restrictions threatened global growth.  “The prospect of trade restrictions and counter-restrictions threatens to ... derail growth prematurely,” said IMF Chief Economist Maurice Obstfeld.  Goldman Sachs does not share the IMF’s concerns. Worries about “trade wars and fears that higher oil prices will start to weigh on demand growth ... are overdone,” it said.

2018-04-20,"(Repeats story published on Thursday) * Aggressive Sechin tactics cement Rosneft’s influence - sources * Oil company seen as instrument of Russian foreign policy * Rosneft has struck deals from Erbil to Caracas and New Delhi * Graphic of Kurdistan's oil map: tmsnrt.rs/2gq0Gk4 By Dmitry Zhdannikov LONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - Last October, at the height of a political crisis in Iraq’s Kurdistan region, a letter arrived at the Iraqi oil ministry in Baghdad from Igor Sechin, head of Kremlin oil major Rosneft. The Baghdad government was showing a “lack of constructive position and interest” about Rosneft’s offer to develop southern Iraqi oilfields, Sechin wrote in the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. Kurdistan, a region of about 6 million people in northern Iraq, had just tried and failed to break away from the rest of the country. Baghdad had dismissed the Sept. 25 independence referendum and sent in troops to seize control of key oilfields - Kurdistan’s main source of income. Now Sechin, one of the closest allies of President Vladimir Putin, said that given Baghdad’s reluctance to work with Rosneft, his firm would instead do business with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), which showed “a higher interest in expanding strategic cooperation”. Global powers including the United States and European Union, which had previously expressed sympathy with the Kurdish independence drive, would eventually reassure Baghdad they recognised its sovereignty over the whole of Iraq, including Kurdistan. But there was no hint of such conciliation in Sechin’s letter. Rosneft had pledged to invest billions of dollars in Kurdistan to the anger of the Baghdad government. Now, instead of backing off, it was doubling down. And Sechin held a stronger hand than many Iraqi officials realised, according to seven sources familiar with the matter. Days before, Rosneft had taken over ownership of landlocked Kurdistan’s oil export pipelines to Turkey from the KRG in return for $1.8 billion. The aim of the deal for Rosneft was not only commercial, but to cement Russia’s political influence in Iraq and the Middle East, according to the Rosneft, oil industry, Kurdish and Iraqi government sources. Control of the pipelines has given Rosneft a central role in ongoing talks between the KRG and Baghdad aimed at resuming full oil exports, which were disrupted by the referendum and Iraqi seizure of oilfields, said the sources. Kurdistan has large oil reserves - possibly a third of Iraq’s total - and its exports are vital to both the regional and national economies. In a sign of Rosneft’s influence, Kurdish officials have said they will not restart oil flows and transfer funds raised to the Iraqi government unless pipeline transit fees are paid to the Russian oil major, according to three industry sources in Erbil and Baghdad. Iraqi oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi effectively recognised the firm’s growing role in Kurdistan when he met Sechin’s right-hand man Didier Casimiro in Baghdad this month and said he was ready to cooperate with Rosneft “in renovating pipelines”. Rosneft, Sechin, the Kremlin and the Iraq’s prime minister’s office did not respond to requests for comment on this story. Sechin and the Kremlin have repeatedly said Rosneft’s projects are purely commercial, not political. The Iraqi oil ministry declined to comment on any political aspects of the Rosneft deal. Rosneft’s actions in Kurdistan, a region long allied to the United States, provide an insight into how the Kremlin uses Rosneft - and its bold chief executive - as an instrument of Russian foreign policy across the world, from Erbil to Caracas and New Delhi, the sources said. Many countries, including Italy and France, have used their oil majors as tools of foreign policy, but Moscow’s use of Rosneft in this way has increased significantly over the past two decades under Putin’s rule. For Kurdistan, Russia’s growing influence represents a sharp geopolitical reversal. The region has been closely aligned to the United States since the toppling of Saddam Hussein during the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Amos Hochstein, who served as the U.S. Special Energy Envoy in the Obama administration, said while Rosneft and other Russian state firms sought to make profits, they also acted as a political entities when necessary. “They report directly to President Putin. Not every transaction that they do is political. But when Putin wants to perform a political transaction, they will definitely do it,” he told Reuters. “Russia doesn’t have a lot of tools to exercise political influence, and energy is the most efficient one”. Baghdad, which does not recognise the deal for the pipelines, has found itself in a difficult situation. The Iraqi government’s finances have been strained by its battle with Islamic State so it has little money to build new pipelines from Kurdistan, while it is loath to significantly disrupt the region’s oil flows, which it is banking on to deliver much-needed revenue. The role played by Rosneft in furthering Kremlin foreign policy is not unique to Iraq and has also played out in other parts of the world, according to the Rosneft and industry sources. “Sechin behaves like a second Russian foreign minister. Or to put it differently, he represents the economic might behind Russian foreign policies,” said one of the industry sources, an acquaintance of the Rosneft boss. “Very often these policies are about poking the Americans right in the eye.” In Venezuela, Rosneft lent around $6 billion to support the government. The company could end up owning large Texan refineries, currently belonging to Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA, because the plants are collateral against the debt. In India, Rosneft invested $13 billion in a refinery – an abnormally high price for an oil processing complex – as it sought to outbid Saudi firm Aramco and boost Russian ties with the country, traditionally allied with the United States. Sechin said earlier this year in a rare interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung he was confident that both Venezuela and Kurdistan would repay their debts in full and denied the deals were political. Asked if he saw himself as a politician, the 57-year-old responded: “It is a difficult question. It often feels like I have already lived several different lives. “I think the right word is a manager.” Born in St Petersburg, he was sent in the 1980s to act as a military interpreter in Mozambique and Angola, where Moscow and Washington were fighting proxy wars. Putin, who had known Sechin since the early 1990s in St Petersburg, took him to Moscow when he rose to power. Sechin helped him nationalise much of the Russian oil industry and was appointed Rosneft CEO in 2012. The Kurds have long argued that as an autonomous region of Iraq they have the authority to make agreements with foreign companies about pumping oil in their territory. In 2014, they started independent oil exports via Turkey. Iraq’s central government, however, says any Kurdish deals with overseas firms, or to export oil from Kurdistan, are illegal without Baghdad’s blessing. Russia was the only major world power that did not oppose the referendum, saying it understood Kurdish aspirations for independence. The United States, EU, Turkey and Iran all urged Erbil to cancel or postpone the vote in the weeks before it. As U.S. State Secretary Rex Tillerson unsuccessfully tried to negotiate a delay to the independence vote, Sechin was busy negotiating the pipelines deal. In the days following the referendum, Kurdish officials including natural resources minister Ashti Hawrami were flown to Moscow to meet Rosneft executives and Russian foreign ministry officials, according to two of the sources. On Oct. 20, at the peak of the post-referendum chaos when Iraqi Shiite militia backed by Iranian troops ousted Kurdish Peshmerga forces from Kirkuk oilfields, Sechin closed the deal. Rosneft paid the last tranche of the $1.8 billion deal sum to Erbil, the sources said. Rosneft and Sechin, both subject to Western sanctions over Russia’s annexation of Crimea, have never disclosed how much the company paid for the pipelines.

2018-04-20,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - World stocks dipped on Friday but were set for a second week of gains after a strong start to the global corporate earnings season, while a rally in commodity prices fizzled out. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.3 percent. Losses by the tech sector in Asia and profit-taking among mining stocks in Europe contributed to the overall losses. The index is still on track for a 1 percent gain this week, as global markets recover from a turbulent first quarter which saw the return of volatility, trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and tensions in the Middle East. “Our base case is that investor focus will shift back to economic growth as some of the current uncertainties ease,” UBS strategists wrote in a note to clients. “In our base case we do not expect current tensions between NATO and Russia to escalate further than issues in the past, such as Crimea, and expect the trade dispute between the U.S. and China to be negotiated without escalating to a trade war.” Shares in Europe were down 0.2 percent, but remain up half a percent on the week and set for their fourth straight week of gains. Dovish remarks overnight from Bank of England Governor Mark Carney weakened the pound, helping the internationally exposed FTSE 100 index outperform with a gain of nearly half a percent. Sterling continued to fall against the dollar, hitting its lowest level against the greenback since April 6. Expectations of a UK interest rate increase in May has shrunk to around 40 percent from 70 percent earlier this week. Elsewhere in currencies, the Swiss franc was slightly stronger against the euro after falling to a three-year low of 1.20 per euro on Thursday. That was past the level which was defended by the Swiss National Bank (SNB) during the brief era of its currency peg with the euro, abandoned in January 2015. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of peer currencies, was up 0.1 percent. Earlier in Asia, shares slipped as a warning from the world’s largest contract chipmaker slugged the tech sector. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing cut its revenue target to the low end of forecasts and blamed softer demand for smartphones. Stocks in South Korea took a 0.5 percent dip. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 1.1 percent, again led by a 1.6 percent fall in technology. Japan’s Nikkei eased 0.1 percent as the drop is tech outweigh the gains in energy and financials. Brent crude futures were down 0.1 percent to $73.68 a barrel, while U.S. crude slipped 0.1 to $68.23. A global oil glut has been virtually eliminated, according to a joint OPEC and non-OPEC technical panel, two sources familiar with the matter said, thanks in part to an OPEC-led supply cut deal in place since January 2017. Analysts at CBA noted market measures of inflation expectations had spiked higher this week as oil prices surged, with some hitting highs not seen since mid-2014. That in turn pressured fixed-income debt with yields on 10-year Treasuries jumping to a one-month top at 2.93 percent. They had last eased slightly to 2.91 percent. Yields are up 10 basis points in just two days, the sharpest move since early February. London aluminium prices ticked higher as a rally driven by fears of supply disruptions caused by U.S. sanctions on Russia’s United Company Rusal, the world’s second-biggest aluminium producer, regained momentum.

2018-04-20,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German transport minister Andreas Scheuer is asking carmakers to tell him how they plan to complete by the end of the year software upgrades on diesel vehicles to reduce emissions, he told a newspaper. “I am pushing for the promised 5.3 million cars to really be upgraded by the end of the year,” Scheuer told Sueddeutsche Zeitung in an interview published on Friday. “We are nearly done with the 2.5 million affected VW cars. For the other voluntary upgrades I have informed the manufacturers that they must present a time plan showing when they will deliver,” he said. The German car industry, which accounts for some 800,000 jobs in Europe’s biggest economy, is struggling with a global backlash against diesel cars after Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in 2015 that it had cheated U.S. exhaust tests. The question of how to deal with the fall-out continues to divide the German political class. Stephan Weil, who as premier of Lower Saxony is responsible for the state’s 20 percent voting stake in VW, warned that it could take a long time to change the corporate culture that had triggered the scandal. Weil, a Social Democrat at the opposite end of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition from the Bavarian conservative Scheuer, urged the government not to burden carmakers with the cost of fixing vehicles. “Software updates can cut emissions by 25 to 30 percent,” he told Handelsblatt newspaper in a separate interview. “Switchover incentives can be used to encourage modernizing of diesel fleets,” he added. Germany has committed to software upgrades for some 5.3 million diesel cars by the end of the year to reduce emissions by up to 30 percent. But Scheuer was less compromising. “Time is running out. I will take the manufacturers at their word,” he told Sueddeutsche. The issue of emissions came to a head in February when a court allowed local authorities to bar heavily polluting diesel vehicles. Experts say bans could cut the resale value of up to 15 million diesel vehicles in Europe’s biggest car market. Scheuer affirmed that he was opposed to bans, and that there were technical, legal and financial arguments against costly hardware retrofits of diesel vehicles.

2018-04-20,"STOCKHOLM, April 20 (Reuters) - Swedish utility Vattenfall launched plans on Friday to become northwestern Europe’s biggest operator of electric vehicle charging infrastructure within five years. The Nordic region’s biggest player said in a statement it targeted turnover for the business of 1 billion crowns ($119 million) by then, banking on the growing need for charging points for electric cars. With Tesla, Porsche and BMW growing sales of their battery-powered cars, and with other car firms planning to speed up their shifts to EVs, the battle over where Europeans charge them is intensifying. Power utilities such as Vattenfall, but also tech start-ups and oil majors are fighting to establish themselves as the dominant players in this fast-growing business. Among players vying to take control before the sector takes off are French utility Engie, Germany’s Innogy , ChargePoint whose owners include BMW, Daimler and Siemens. Vattenfall’s Finnish rival Fortum has also made several acquisitions to compete in the sector. State-owned Vattenfall, which already operates home, business and public charging solutions in Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands, said the business now planned to enter new markets including Britain, France and Norway. “From now on we expect our charging network to double in size every year in order meet a sharp increase in electric vehicle growth,” it said. Norway has the largest electric car penetration globally, followed by the Netherlands and Sweden.

2018-04-20,"NAIROBI, April 20 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In February, Kenyans awoke to news that has become an annual ritual: Authorities were considering temporarily shutting down hydropower dams, the country’s largest source of electricity. The reason was the one given each dry season for the last four years – too long without rain had left too little water in reservoirs to turn the turbines and generate power. Kenya Power Ltd., the national electricity utility, has so far always managed to avoid a full shutdown, instead turning off just a few turbines at a time. But to make up the gap it has turned to more expensive – and polluting – diesel generators to keep the country plugged in. Now, however, another clean source of power may help fill the gap: Geothermal power. Over more than a decade, Kenya has invested over $1 billion in tapping the country’s underground steam, including a $400 million loan from Japan to develop geothermal wells that are expected to come online in 2019 with 140 megawatts (MW) of new power. The country already gets about 675 MW of the electricity it needs from geothermal power – about a quarter of its total needs – which makes Kenya Africa’s largest geothermal producer, and the eighth largest in the world, according to the country’s Energy Regulatory Commission. With new green power being added from geothermal, solar and wind energy, hydropower now accounts for just 45 percent of the country’s energy mix, down from around 60 percent a decade ago, according to Energy Principal Secretary Joseph Njoroge. That has helped shore up power supplies and hold the line on prices, said Isaac Kiva, the renewable energy secretary in the energy ministry. “Kenya’s decision over the years to invest in geothermal energy has ensured relative stability in power supply to consumers, allowing as well relative stability in electricity costs,” he said in response to email questions. Kenya has tapped less than 10 percent of the geothermal energy it would like to. Experts say that reserves of steam in Kenya’s Rift Valley region could generate up 10,000 MW, double the target set by the government’s Vision 2030 development plan. Geothermal could help many countries in East Africa tap into more sustainable, reliable and clean energy in a region that is facing worsening droughts linked to climate change and strained hydropower production. The East Africa region is estimated to have a geothermal potential of more than 22,000 MW of electricity, according to the African Rift Geothermal Development Facility (ARGeo), a project of the United Nations Environment Programme. It believes Kenya and Ethiopia lead in terms of geothermal potential, with 10,000 MW each. The next highest-ranked countries, Djibouti, Tanzania and Uganda, range from 1,000 MW to 450 MW, according to ARGeo figures. Geothermal could generate nearly half of Tanzania’s current installed electricity capacity, more than half of Uganda’s, and more than double Ethiopia’s, the project noted. Exploring for and developing geothermal energy has high initial costs – a problem shared by many renewable energy technologies. But, once in place, “geothermal provides for a cheap source of energy to many countries”, said Adnan Amin, head of the International Renewable Energy Agency, in an interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Amin noted that Kenya had seen an overall drop of 30 percent in electricity tariffs in the last few years, despite hydropower shortages. Costs as high as $5 million to drill a single geothermal exploration well can deter countries from investing, Amin said. But improving technology – and better investment models – should help cut the cost in the future, he said. In Kenya, for instance, government investment in geothermal exploration and test drilling – combined with offers to buy geothermal power at attractive rates – has made it easier and less risky for private investors to step in, Amin said. That’s one reason Kenya now has more than 650 MW of geothermal power and Ethiopia only 8 MW, though Ethiopia is now moving to develop 1,000 MW of geothermal power, Amin said. Joseph Kabyemera, head of the African Development Bank’s Climate Development Fund, said countries could speed up adding geothermal power to their energy mix by tapping into things like the Geothermal Risk Mitigation Fund for East Africa. The facility, established by the African Union, aims to encourage government and private investment in geothermal power by providing grants for studies to find the best well locations and test drilling.

Spreadbetters pointed to a firm start for European shares, with FTSE futures up 0.3 percent but E-Minis for S&P 500 were a tad softer as were Dow futures. In Asia, Apple led the way after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing cut its revenue target to the low end of forecasts and blamed softer demand for smartphones. “The big story for the APAC region today will be fallout from TSMC’s miss, which will weigh heavily on the tech sector, with first order impacts on the Semis and Samsung Electronics/ Galaxy supply chain,” analysts at JPMorgan said in a note. “The miss appears largely to have been due to Apple iPhones, and so may also weigh on the Apple supply chain.” Taiwan’s main index slid 1.8 percent with techs sinking 3.5 percent and TSMC off more than 6 percent. Stocks in South Korea took a 0.5 percent dip. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 1.1 percent, again led by a 1.6 percent fall in technology. Japan’s Nikkei eased 0.1 percent as the drop is tech outweight the gains in energy and financials. Wall Street had also been hit by weak results from tobacco company Philip Morris, which sent its shares down as much as 17.7 percent and dragged on the S&P 500. The Dow ended down 0.34 percent, while the S&P 500 lost 0.57 percent and the Nasdaq 0.78 percent. Oil prices eased a bit after hitting their highest since late 2014 on drawdowns in global supply and as Saudi Arabia looks to fatten its export revenue. Brent crude futures were off 10 cents to $73.68 a barrel, while U.S. crude slipped 20 cents to $68.09.

In currency markets, the main mover was sterling which dived late on Thursday when Bank of England Governor Mark Carney cooled expectations for an interest rate hike in May, pointing out there were “other meetings” this year. Sterling dropped more than a cent to $1.4078, leaving the week’s peak of $1.4373 a distant memory. The sudden retreat in sterling helped support the U.S. dollar more broadly and the dollar index was steady at 89.986. The euro also eased back a touch to $1.2336, while the dollar inched up on the yen to 107.55 and looked set to test the recent top at 107.78.

2018-04-20,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia moved a step closer on Friday to ending a decade of political bickering over climate and energy policy, with broad support emerging for a national power plan that would also include emissions cuts. State energy ministers agreed to push ahead with a detailed design for a National Energy Guarantee, as proposed by the conservative government, to be put up for approval in August. “This is Australia’s best chance to integrate energy and climate policy and deliver cheaper, cleaner, more reliable power to all Australians,” Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg told reporters.  He said he was confident that issues raised by the states, including differences on emissions cutting goals, could be worked out by August. Carbon policy disputes have claimed the heads of two prime ministers and then-opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull over the past 10 years, killing investment in fossil-fueled power needed for a stable grid and leaving the states to take the lead on renewable energy. The National Energy Guarantee would require the power sector to cut carbon emissions by 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. At the same it will require electricity providers to ensure they have enough supply from steady power sources like coal- and gas-fired plants to back up intermittent sources like wind and solar power. Inching toward long elusive bi-partisan support, Labor opposition energy spokesman Mark Butler and two key Labor-led states, Victoria and Queensland, backed the call to continue work on the proposal. Victoria and Queensland had been seen as the main stumbling blocks, as they want to cut carbon emissions more sharply than the government, with more ambitious targets for renewable energy and plans to end coal-fired generation. “We’re pleased that we’ve received a number of assurances, and that is that the states’ own renewable energy and emissions reduction targets will be honored,” Victorian Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio told reporters after the meeting. Frydenberg said the states’ own emissions targets would stand under the umbrella of the National Energy Guarantee, requiring them to ensure there is back-up for wind and solar power to keep the lights on. Labor has said the policy must be structured to allow the party to ramp up the emissions reduction target if it wins the next federal election. A rare coalition of business groups, power providers, and energy consumers has urged politicians to back the plan, seeking an end to years of investment uncertainty which has led to blackouts and soaring power prices in Australia. “Lack of agreement on the NEG will see increased volatility in markets, higher energy prices, a lack of forward planning and investment, and likely result in manufacturing jobs heading offshore to more secure and affordable energy jurisdictions,” the Energy Users Association of Australia said in a statement.

2018-04-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - Formerly skeptical investors are buying back into oil majors in the hope that upcoming results will mark a turning point for energy stocks which have failed to keep pace with a surge in crude prices. Oil stocks could begin to close that gap if results live up to lofty expectations, with Goldman Sachs predicting the strongest free cash flow figures in a decade for the sector. Oil is the best-performing global asset this year, with Brent crude up 11.4 percent since January, but energy stocks have continued to lag the commodity. While Europe’s oil and gas sector .SXEP is the best-performing year-to-date, it still has a way to go to catch up with crude. The gap between returns from Brent crude LCOc1 and from MSCI’s global energy index .MIWD0EN00PUS from the start of 2017 has widened to 25 percentage points.  For graphic on oil stocks lag crude click tmsnrt.rs/2DPMJUs For investors who put money on a revival in oil stocks a long time ago, the wait has been taxing, and baffling. “We had an overweight all through last year, it was horrendous,” said John Surplice, European equities fund manager at Invesco Perpetual.  “They underperformed the market even though fundamentals have improved quite dramatically. I struggle to answer the question why they’ve been so poor until the last few weeks,” he added. The correlation between WTI crude and share prices has fallen from 90 percent in 2017 to just 36 percent so far this year, according to PVM analyst Tamas Varga, perhaps signaling investors’ lingering doubts about oil companies’ ability to translate higher crude into better shareholder returns. For graphic on European oil stocks EPS rises click reut.rs/2HaYq8V Surplice still has a big overweight in oil and gas, a sector he considers defensive despite many investors remaining skeptical. “Cash flows are growing rapidly, dividends are very good and you’re starting to get some buybacks,” he said. The fact higher oil prices have not yet trickled down into shares leaves a lot of room for gains.  With oil prices currently at $74 a barrel, Europe’s exploration and production firms are pricing in a long-term oil price of just $52 per barrel, Barclays analysts estimate.  Senior management at big oil companies is also aware they still have to put their money where their mouth is for the shares to begin recoupling with the commodity.  For graphic on April 19 Energy stocks valuations click reut.rs/2JXztzD “We’ll need to show for a little bit longer that we actually mean what we say in terms of capital discipline and returning excess free cash flow to shareholders,” said Shell CEO Ben van Beurden in a briefing on Monday.  “The newfound religion and confidence in the sector is, to say the least, fragile,” he added. There are at least some new converts. Eric Moore, an income fund manager at Miton Group who used to be wary of oil stocks due to dividend yields he saw as dangerously high, has now moved to an overweight on the sector.  “With the rise in oil prices that we’ve seen, the sustainability of the dividends is better,” he said.  The damage of the 2014 commodities downturn, along with the rise of mega-cap technology stocks, has taken energy stocks’ share of the total MSCI World market cap to its lowest in 17 years, meaning global investors have ample alternatives available if they want to avoid the sector completely.  It is these generalists that oil companies will have to convince in results. For graphic on April 19 energy share of global market cap click reut.rs/2JZQNnt Brokers JPMorgan, RBC, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and HSBC all believe the oil sector’s first-quarter earnings will deliver strong cash flows and higher dividends. “We see the upcoming results season as a chance at redemption for the group,” wrote Biraj Borkhataria, oil analyst at RBC. Goldman Sachs analysts see the European big oil companies delivering the highest free cash flow in almost a decade. Earnings estimates have recovered to their highest since 2015. And these bigger cash piles should translate into dividend increases. Oil majors have long avoided cutting their dividends, making a dividend hike an even more powerful signal. “A dividend hike is forever,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.  The fundamentals of the oil market are also convincing investors that the crude price surge is more than just a blip. Backwardation - whereby longer-dated crude futures are at a lower price than the nearest month - is good for oil companies, and several analysts pointed to signs of rising supply constraints in the crucial Permian basin oil-producing region in the Southern United States. For graphic on April 19 oil price scatter graph click reut.rs/2J97BHw Brokers’ high expectations have, however, made some investors wary of betting the farm on oil majors.  “We are neutral on European energy, driven by the fact they have had a lot of positive earnings revisions. It’s becoming more of a binary outcome,” said Pierre Bose, head of European strategy at Credit Suisse Wealth Management.  Positioning on the sector is still at average levels, Bose added, an indication many investors are still on the fence.  A main challenge for investors is how to time their rotation back into the sector, and tailor it to the turning tide in the oil market. For graphic on crude price versus oil stocks April 19 click reut.rs/2JWPrtS “You do get these things happening with cyclical stocks - the sentiment just gets overdone and it’s like turning around a super tanker,” said Richard Robinson, oil fund manager at Ashburton. Far from a pessimistic sign, he reads the divergence between crude and stocks as a buy signal.  “The last time we saw that big dislocation was in 2002, and then the bull market where the energy sector went up 202 percent against MSCI World,” he said, adding “2019 is crunch time.” Robinson has reduced his holdings in battery firms, arguing the electric car story was “overcooked”, and put money into offshore oil instead. “An oil price toward the $80 at the end of the year allows the offshore to start again. It’s desperately needed,” he said. Some of the larger exploration and production (E&P) firms, such as Aker, Lundin and Tullow Oil, which are more sensitive to the oil price, trade at a premium to the sector.  Barclays analysts say these stocks’ performance will depend on the extent to which investors risk venturing out of the bigger oil firms in search of higher leverage to crude. Miton’s Moore, for example, owns shares in E&P firm Premier Oil (PMO.L) in order to have geared exposure to the rise in crude prices, balancing out his holdings in Shell (RDSa.L) and BP (BP.L), which are less sensitive to it.

The issue of emissions came to a head in February when a court allowed local authorities to bar heavily polluting diesel vehicles. Experts say bans could cut the resale value of up to 15 million diesel vehicles in Europe’s biggest car market. Scheuer affirmed that he was opposed to bans, and that there were technical, legal and financial arguments against costly hardware retrofits of diesel vehicles.

2018-04-20,"April 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said it expects global oil demand growth to remain strong this year and contribute to further declines in oil inventories. “We believe that the combination of strong developed markets momentum and accelerating emerging markets growth will combine to keep oil demand growth above consensus expectations, with our 2018 year on year forecast at 1.85 million barrels per day (mb/d),” Goldman said in a note dated Thursday. Global oil demand in 2018 has come in line with its optimistic expectations, with the first quarter likely to post the strongest year on year growth since fourth quarter 2010 at 2.55 mb/d, the bank said. “While global oil data for Jan/Feb supports our constructive demand outlook for the year, we expect March data will show weaker demand growth given transient headwinds.” Seasonal distortions and unusually cold temperatures could have resulted in softer March data, the bank said, adding that was likely just a transient weakness as strong refinery margins supported its view of robust demand in April. Goldman, however, said volatile Chinese data, slowdown in global demand growth in March, ongoing trade tensions and fears that higher oil prices will start to weigh on demand growth have led to increased concern about the sustainability of demand strength.

2018-04-20,"* Tech shares follow Apple lower after chipmaker warning * Oil prices just off highs, supported as supply tightens * Inflation unease pushes up long-term bond yields * Sterling skids after BoE’s Carney sounds dovish By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, April 20 (Reuters) - Asian shares slipped on Friday as a warning on smartphone demand from the world’s largest contract chipmaker slugged the tech sector, while high oil prices stirred inflation fears and undermined sovereign bonds. Apple led the way after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing cut its revenue target to the low end of forecasts and blamed softer demand for smartphones. “The big story for the APAC region today will be fallout from TSMC’s miss, which will weigh heavily on the tech sector, with first order impacts on the Semis and Samsung Electronics/ Galaxy supply chain,” analysts at JPMorgan said in a note. “The miss appears largely to have been due to Apple iPhones, and so may also weigh on the Apple supply chain.” Taiwan’s main index slid 1.4 percent with techs sinking 3.5 percent and TSMC off more than 5 percent. Stocks in South Korea took a 0.3 percent dip, with the tech sector losing 1.6 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 0.8 percent, again led by a 0.7 percent fall in technology. Japan’s Nikkei recouped early losses to rise 0.1 percent as gains in energy and financials outweighed the drop in tech. Wall Street had also been hit by weak results from tobacco company Philip Morris, which sent its shares down as much as 17.7 percent and dragged on the S&P 500. The Dow ended down 0.34 percent, while the S&P 500 lost 0.57 percent and the Nasdaq 0.78 percent. Oil prices were creeping up again after hitting their highest since late 2014 on drawdowns in global supply and as Saudi Arabia looks to fatten its export revenue. Brent crude futures edged up 6 cents to $73.83 a barrel, while U.S. crude added 7 cents to $68.36. A global oil glut has been virtually eliminated, according to a joint OPEC and non-OPEC technical panel, two sources familiar with the matter said, thanks in part to an OPEC-led supply cut deal in place since January 2017. Analysts at CBA noted market measures of inflation expectations had spiked higher this week as oil prices surged, with some hitting highs not seen since mid-2014. That in turn pressured fixed-income debt with yields on 10-year Treasuries jumping to a one-month top at 2.93 percent. Yields are up 10 basis points in just two days, the sharpest move since early February. In currency markets, the main mover was sterling which dived late on Thursday when Bank of England Governor Mark Carney cooled expectations for an interest rate hike in May, pointing out there were “other meetings” this year. Sterling dropped more than a cent to $1.4078, leaving the week’s peak of $1.4373 a distant memory. The sudden retreat in sterling helped support the U.S. dollar more broadly and the dollar index was steady at 89.956. The euro also eased back a touch to $1.2341, while the dollar inched up on the yen to 107.62 and looked set to test the recent top at 107.78.

2018-04-20,"ESSEN, Germany (Reuters) - Local utility Steag expects more mergers and acquisitions in Germany’s energy market following a landmark deal between E.ON (EONGn.DE) and RWE (RWEG.DE) to break up renewables and networks group Innogy (IGY.DE). “The energy sector is seeing the next step of consolidation,” Steag’s CEO Joachim Rumstadt said at the company’s annual press conference on Thursday, adding utilities had realised the need to focus and not cover the complete value chain. Innogy’s breakup, announced last month, will see RWE become Europe’s second-biggest wind power player, while E.ON turns into the continent’s largest power and gas networks group. Rumstadt said there were foreign utilities in Germany looking to sell their coal-fired power plants while other power firms were interested in entering the German market, not disclosing any names. Sources previously told Reuters that France’s Engie (ENGIE.PA) was looking to sell its German power plants and that RWE was talking to local peer EnBW (EBKG.DE) about some of its assets. Rumstadt also said that Steag, which is owned by seven municipalities in Germany’s industrial Ruhr heartland in North Rhine-Westphalia, as well as some of its power plants had attracted outside interest including on possible partnerships, declining to comment further. RWE is not in talks with Steag about its power plant assets, a spokeswoman for the group said, confirming similar remarks to newspaper Rheinische Post. Steag saw its sales rise by about 8 percent to 3.6 billion euros (£3.1 billion) last year, while its operating profit (EBIT) jumped 60 percent to 197 million euros. The group expects this year’s EBIT to fall by about 30 percent, hit by lower profits in conventional power generation.

2018-04-20," (This April 17 story has been corrected in the final paragraph to show Aviareto operates a registry that tracks financial interests in aircraft, not ICAO registry for manned aircraft) By Allison Lampert and Jamie Freed MONTREAL/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The world’s airlines are backing the development of a United Nations-led global registry for drones, as a rise in near collisions by unmanned aircraft and commercial jets fuels safety concerns, an executive of their trade group said on Tuesday. The International Air Transport Association backs efforts by the United Nations’ aviation agency to develop such a registry, which could also help track the number of incidents involving drones and jets, said Rob Eagles, IATA’s director of air traffic management infrastructure. IATA would consider collaborating with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to use the registry for data analysis to improve safety. ICAO is developing the registry as part of broader efforts to come up with common rules for flying and tracking unmanned aircraft. “One of the important things we would like to see on a registry as well is the compilation of data which would include incident and accident reporting,” Eagles said in an interview on the sidelines of IATA’s Safety and Flight Ops Conference in Montreal.     Airlines and airport operators are looking to drone registries, geo-fencing technology and stiffer penalties for operating drones near airports. They hope these steps will ensure flying remains safe as hobbyists and companies like Amazon.com Inc use more drones.      In Britain, the number of near misses between drones and aircraft more than tripled between 2015 and 2017, with 92 incidents recorded last year, according to the U.K. Airprox Board.  Air New Zealand Ltd said last month a flight from Tokyo with 278 passengers and crew on board encountered a drone estimated to be just five meters away from the Boeing 777-200 jet during its descent into Auckland.    A single registry would create a one-stop-shop that would allow law enforcement to remotely identify and track unmanned aircraft, along with their operator and owner.   “The intention at present is to merge this activity into the ICAO registry for manned aircraft, so that the sector has a single consolidated registry network,” said ICAO spokesman Anthony Philbin by email.   Barbara Dalibard, head of Switzerland-based aviation technology group SITA, said her company wanted to build a blockchain-based global drone registry and had been working with Geneva Airport on tests of a geo-fenced zone around the airport where drones listed in the registry would not be able to fly.  “The data is connected to the airport system,” she said during an interview in Singapore on Tuesday.  “The drone is approaching the airport and it says ‘No, go back’. If everything is connected you can ask the drone to change its flight plan or to readjust in order to get out of the danger zone,” she added. SITA also has a joint venture with the Irish government called Aviareto which operates a registry that tracks financial interests in certain aircraft.

2018-04-20,"* Brent, WTI this week reached highest levels since November, 2014 * Tighter crude market feeding into refined products * Rising U.S. production is one of few factors holding crude back By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, April 20 (Reuters) - Oil prices were firm on Friday near three-year highs reached earlier this week as ongoing OPEC-led supply cuts gradually drawn down excess supplies. Brent crude oil futures were at $73.69 per barrel at 0129 GMT, down 9 cents from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 7 cents at $68.22 a barrel. Led by top exporter Saudi Arabia, the producer cartel of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has been withholding production since 2017 to draw down a global supply overhang that had depressed crude prices between 2014 and 2016. As a result of a gradually tightening market, both Brent and WTI hit their highest levels since November, 2014 earlier this week, at $74.75 and $69.56 per barrel respectively. The tighter oil market is also starting to feed into refined products, which use crude as their main feedstock to make fuels such as gasoline or diesel “Signs of tightness are emerging in product markets as stocks saw the largest week-on-week draw since October, 2016 ... The U.S. led the draws but was also aided by draws in Singapore,” said U.S. bank Morgan Stanley. Beyond OPEC’s supply management, crude prices have also been supported by an expectation that the United States will re-introduce sanctions on OPEC-member Iran. One of the factors that has somewhat held back prices from rising even further has been rising U.S. production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has jumped by a quarter since mid-2016 to 10.54 million barrels per day, making the United States the world’s second biggest producer of crude oil behind only Russia, which pumps almost 11 million bpd.

2018-04-20,"(Repeats item with no changes to text) * Tomakomai test site to store 300,000 T of CO2 by 2020 * Site aims to show CCS can work for industrial uses * Japan CCS says 1 mln T/yr simulation shows method viable By Aaron Sheldrick TOMAKOMAI, Japan, April 19 (Reuters) - A test site in Japan for burying carbon dioxide (CO2) below the seabed off Hokkaido island is showing more promise than other carbon, capture and storage (CCS) projects by cutting costs and increasing efficiency, its developer says. While the $300 million site at Tomakomai port represents a small portion of the $20 billion invested in CCS, it has potential for easing CO2 emissions from industries such as gas processing and cement and chemical production. Most investments into CCS have focused on capturing carbon from power plants fired by coal and other fossil fuels - the largest source of CO2 emissions - but there have been big setbacks and some projects cancelled. “Tomakomai is an exciting development. Progress on CCS has been far too slow and projects like that are very encouraging,” said Graham Winkelman, climate change lead at BHP. Industrial applications such as that being tested at the Tomakomai site are where the focus now is on CCS, he said. BHP is the world’s largest exporter of coal for steel-making, a fuel and industry often marked as big sources of climate-warming emissions. On an exclusive tour of the Tomakomai test site, developers told Reuters they have cut energy costs by as much as two-thirds compared with other projects and increased the efficiency of capturing CO2. Those claims have yet to be tested commercially but the project operated by Japan CCS - owned by Japan Petroleum Exploration, Mitsubishi Corp, JXTG Holdings and more than 30 other companies - looks promising. In contrast, Southern Co’s Kemper power station in the United States was to use CCS in an attempt to get clean power from coal, but was abandoned after billions of dollars of investment. Chevron Corp has also delayed the world’s largest CO2 injection operation in Australia, after spending A$2.5 billion ($2 billion) on the project at its Gorgon liquefied natural gas plant, itself beset by many problems. CCS involves separating CO2 from other materials and gases and injecting it underground to prevent it from escaping into the atmosphere or to use it to create pressure to push oil to the surface as wells deplete. At Tomakomai, by-product gas is piped from a nearby Idemitsu Kosan refinery and CO2 pulled out as it passes through an amine solution. By using the remaining gases to generate power and recycling heat, energy costs are cut to between 1/2 and 1/3 of a typical extraction plant, the company said. When Reuters visited the site, a counter showed 150,000 tonnes of CO2 had been injected, halfway to the project’s targeted 300,000 tonnes. The injection project is scheduled to run until 2020, with no decision yet on commercial operations. Asked about costs, officials declined to state figures. Japan CCS has run simulations scaling the site to handle 1 million tonnes a year and these show it can make commercial sense, said Chiyoko Suzuki, manager of international relations at Japan CCS, during the visit. Australia’s CarbonNet, looking at a similar type of CCS project, last year estimated the cost of compressing, transporting and burying carbon dioxide from gas processing, fertiliser manufacturing and hydrogen production at A$30 ($23.41) a tonne. Suzuki said he did not know CarbonNet’s details so could not make a judgement. CCS will be needed to cut 14 percent of the emissions that have to be abated by 2060 to limit a global rise in average temperatures to less than 2 Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), the International Energy Agency says.
