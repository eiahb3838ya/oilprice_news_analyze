2018-06-30,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran is studying ways to keep exporting oil and other measures to counter U.S. economic sanctions, state news agency IRNA reported on Saturday. Since last month, when U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal which lifted most sanctions in 2015, the rial currency has dropped up to 40 percent in value, prompting protests by bazaar traders usually loyal to the Islamist rulers. Speaking after three days of those protests, supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the U.S. sanctions were aimed at turning Iranians against their government.  Other protesters clashed with police late on Saturday during a demonstration against shortages of drinking water.  “They bring to bear economic pressure to separate the nation from the system ... but six U.S. presidents before him (Trump) tried this and had to give up,” Khamenei said on his website Khamenei.ir. With the return of U.S. sanctions likely to make it increasingly difficult to access the global financial system, President Hassan Rouhani has met the head of parliament and the judiciary to discuss counter-measures. “Various scenarios of threats to the Iranian economy by the U.S. government were examined and appropriate measures were taken to prepare for any probable U.S. sanctions, and to prevent their negative impact,” IRNA said. One such measure was seeking self-sufficiency in gasoline production, the report added. The government and parliament have also set up a committee to study potential buyers of oil and ways of repatriating the income after U.S. sanctions take effect, Fereydoun Hassanvand, head of the parliament’s energy committee, was quoted as saying by IRNA. “Due to the possibility of U.S. sanctions against Iran, the committee will study the competence of buyers and how to obtain proceeds from the sale of oil, safe sale alternatives which are consistent with international law and do not lead to corruption and profiteering,” Hassanvand said.  The United States has told allies to cut all imports of Iranian oil beginning in November, a senior State Department official said on Tuesday. In the separate unrest, demonstrators protesting against shortages of drinking water in oil-rich southwestern Iran clashed with police late on Saturday after officers ordered about 500 protesters to disperse, IRNA reported.  Police fired tear gas as protesters damaged banks and set fire to a bridge in the city of Khorramshahr, IRNA reported later, adding that some unrest continued into the night. Shots could be heard on videos circulated on social media from the protests in Khorramshahr which has been the scene of demonstrations for the past three days, along with the nearby city of Abadan. The videos could not be authenticated by Reuters. A number of protests have broken out in Iran since the beginning of the year over water, a growing political concern due to a drought which residents of parched areas and analysts say has been exacerbated by mismanagement. Speaking before the IRNA report on the clash, Khamenei said the United States was acting together with Sunni Muslim Gulf Arab states that regard Shi’ite Muslim Iran as their main regional foe in trying to destabilise the government in Tehran. “If America was able to act against Iran, it would not need to form coalitions with notorious and reactionary states in the region and ask their help in fomenting unrest and instability,” Khamenei told graduating Revolutionary Guards officers, in remarks carried by state TV.

2018-06-30,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The CEO of Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Herbert Diess, told a German newspaper the arrest of Audi head Rupert Stadler was a shock and hard to comprehend. VW has suspended Stadler, head of VW’s most profitable brand, after German authorities arrested him as part of an emissions probe. “It was a massive shock for me. The arrest of a CEO of a major car brand: that’s never happened before,” Diess told Germany newspaper Bild am Sonntag. “The arrest is hard to comprehend. I knew Rupert Stadler as a problem solver,” the newspaper quoted him as saying. Diess said that for him, Diess was innocent until proven guilty.  Stadler, who has not made any public comment, has not been charged and prosecutors are set to continue questioning him next week. Asked whether he could imagine Stadler returning, Diess said it depended on what facts emerge: “Should the accusations of the state prosecutors prove to be true, then it’s a clear decision.” He said that he did not believe Audi would suffer immediately from the departure of its CEO.  “But if it lasts too long, then it does become a problem. However, I am convinced that we will get through this.” Reporting by Victoria Bryan; Editing by Robin Pomeroy",https://uk.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-emissions-ceo/vw-ceo-says-arrest-of-audis-stadler-hard-to-comprehend-bild-am-sonntag-idUKL8N1TW0MK,30 Jun 2018,"The CEO of Volkswagen

2018-06-30,"(Adds details, background) LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - Libya’s oil production has been reduced to 315,000 barrels per day (bpd) as storage tanks at Hariga and Zueitina ports fill up due to eastern officials blocking exports, two Libyan oil sources said on Saturday. The production drop has been gradual as ships have been barred from loading at the ports since Thursday. Some two-thirds of storage capacity at eastern ports is out of action and the remaining capacity is nearly full, one of the sources said. Storage at oil fields is also limited due to attacks by Islamic State militants in previous years. Libya had been producing more than 1 million bpd in recent months, but on June 14 an attack against forces loyal to eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar at the ports of Ras Lanuf and Es Sider shut them down, slashing production by 450,000 bpd. After recapturing the ports, Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) announced it would be handing them to a parallel National Oil Corporation (NOC) in the eastern city of Benghazi, which said it would stop exports under the internationally recognised NOC in Tripoli, raising the prospect of prolonged output losses. The Tripoli NOC has said it expects to declare force majeure on exports from Zueitina and Hariga on Sunday, bringing total production losses to 800,000 bpd. Port sources said there was no change to the situation on Saturday, with tankers booked by the NOC in Tripoli still blocked from loading. Western powers have called for the ports to be returned to the exclusive control of NOC Tripoli. Past attempts by eastern-based factions to sell oil independently of Tripoli have been thwarted by U.N. Security Council resolutions.

2018-06-30,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq will begin a manual recount of votes on Tuesday from a May parliamentary election clouded by allegations of fraud, a step towards the formation of a new parliament and government. Only suspect ballots flagged in formal complaints or official reports on fraud will be recounted, a spokesman for the panel of judges conducting the recount said on Saturday. “The manual recount will be conducted in the presence of representatives from the United Nations, foreign embassies and political parties; as well as local and international observers, members of the media, and the Ministries of Defence and the Interior,” Judge Laith Jabr Hamza said in a statement. In seven provinces where many complaints of fraud were made — Kirkuk, Sulaimaniya, Erbil, Dohuk, Nineveh, Salahuddin and Anbar — the recount will be conducted by the local electoral offices, Hamza said. Those ballot boxes which had already been transferred to Baghdad will be recounted in the capital. The recount has been a politically fraught issue with the leaders of winning blocs embroiled in negotiations for weeks over the formation of the next government. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, whose electoral list came third in the poll marred by a historically low turnout, and the winner, cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, entered into an alliance last week, less than two weeks after Sadr announced a similar alliance with second-placed Iran ally Hadi al-Amiri’s bloc, thus bringing the top three blocs together. The recount will exclude Baghdad where a storage site holding half of Baghdad’s ballot boxes went up in flames earlier this month in an incident Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi described as a “plot to harm the nation and its democracy”. Overseas votes in Iran, Turkey, Britain, Lebanon, Jordan, the United States and Germany will also be recounted, Hamza said. Earlier in June, the outgoing parliament passed a law mandating a nationwide manual recount of all votes, but the panel of judges now in charge of the process said it would only be conducted for those problematic ballots.

2018-06-30,"RIYADH, June 30 (Reuters) - Kuwait will raise oil output by 85,000 barrels per day (bpd)starting on Sunday, part of an agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to increase production by one million bpd, Energy Minister Bakhit al-Rashidi told a local newspaper on Saturday. “Kuwait will raise its oil production from tomorrow to 2.785 million barrels, a daily increase of 85,000 compared to May, based on last week’s production cut agreement,” Rashidi told Arabic-language daily Al-Rai. OPEC agreed with Russia and other oil-producing allies this month to raise output from July by about 1 million bpd. Saudi Arabia plans to pump up to 11 million bpd in July, and Russia has said it could increase output by more than 200,000 bpd. Oil prices hit $80 a barrel this year for the first time since 2014, prompting consumers like the United States to raise concerns. The output increases come as the United States has urged some OPEC members to raise output to compensate for supply losses caused by renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran. U.S. President Donald Trump said in a tweet on Saturday that Saudi Arabia’s King Salman had agreed to his request to increase oil production “maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels” to offset production from Iran and Venezuela.
