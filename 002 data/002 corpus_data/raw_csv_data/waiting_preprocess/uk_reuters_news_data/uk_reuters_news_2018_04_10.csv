2018-04-10,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said on Tuesday it boosted Chief Executive Mike Wirth’s salary by 20 percent to $1.5 million when he took the oil producer’s top job two months ago.  Wirth, who has worked at Chevron for more than 35 years and was previously the company’s vice chairman, is also elgible for stock awards and other compansation this year potentially worth more than $15 million. The pay raise came after Wirth’s compensation as vice chairman was boosted last year by more than 25 percent, according to regulatory filings.  Wirth earned compensation last year of $11.7 million, up from $6.5 million in 2016. Chevron paid roughly $350,000 last year to bolster security at Wirth’s home and about $16,000 for a medical checkup and related costs for its incoming CEO. It is not uncommon for companies to insist on tighter security for incoming CEOs. Chevron, like many peers, also has its CEOs travel on company-owned aircraft, even for personal matters. Chevron awarded outgoing CEO John Watson $24.8 million in compensation for 2017, roughly 1 percent higher than the prior year, as the company swung to an annual profit of $9.2 billion.  Watson’s compensation in 2017 was 180 times larger than the median compensation of $137,849 for Chevron’s 52,953 employees. Chevron will hold its annual shareholder meeting on May 30 at its headquarters in San Ramon, Calif. Shareholders will consider proposals on climate change and executive compensation, though those votes will be nonbinding.

2018-04-10,"WELLINGTON, April 11 (Reuters) - Gale-force winds battered New Zealand’s largest city, Auckland, leaving thousands without power on Wednesday morning as authorities urged residents to stay home. Gusts as high as 146 kilometres (90 miles) an hour tore down trees and power lines overnight, leaving more than 100,000 homes and businesses without power and likely taking days to fix, according to electricity distributor Vector. Roads were littered with debris and some traffic lights were out, prompting authorities to request the more than 1.3 million residents of New Zealand’s commercial capital to stay home if possible. “There is damage across Auckland this morning after last night’s severe storm ... please only travel if you have to,” Auckland City Council said on its website. The storm, which was expected to continue for the next few days, started pummelling the country on Tuesday, bringing unseasonable autumn snow to parts of the South Island and small tornados in the central north island. Air New Zealand warned that flights were likely to be affected, though most flights in and out of Auckland were running on Wednesday according to the national carrier’s website. Heavy rains and snow were expected to continue for the next few days and the country’s Metservice issued a warning of more severe winds in Auckland expected to hit on Thursday night.

2018-04-10,"HOUSTON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Chinese investment firm is attempting to restructure an $812 million deal for the U.S. developer of the Alerian MLP Index .AMZ, which tracks publicly traded energy infrastructure companies, three people familiar with the matter said in recent days, after missing two deadlines to close the deal.   Hong Kong-based ZZ Capital International Ltd (8295.HK) agreed last July to buy Alerian, a Dallas-based financial index and data provider, for $582 million in cash and up to $230 million in additional payments if it hit revenue targets from 2018 to 2021. ZZ Capital declined to comment. Alerian did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday and earlier declined to make its chief executive available for comment on the status of the agreement.  A collapse of the deal would demonstrate the difficulties Chinese companies now face in financing and purchasing high-profile U.S. assets. Chinese regulators last year began pressuring domestic banks to rein in their overseas investments, reducing capital for deals.  That clampdown has required ZZ Capital to seek “offshore funding for existing deal pipeline” and slow new M&A proposals, it said in a regulatory filing in February.    While small, Alerian has a significant role in promoting infrastructure investments, especially in U.S. shale fields, through its indexes and data on energy investments. Both parties were continuing to negotiate the deal, the sources familiar with the matter said this week. The purchase originally was expected to close by December, but ZZ Capital said in January it had won an extension to March 31 to fulfill undisclosed conditions. It has not publicly commented since last month’s deadline expired.  The U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an intra-government agency that scrutinizes foreign groups’ purchases of U.S. assets to protect national security interests, rejected the initial application for the Alerian deal, one of the sources said on Tuesday. A Treasury Department spokesman for CFIUS declined to comment, noting the agency is prohibited from disclosing information filed with it.   Alerian is majority-owned by Gabriel and Daniel Hammond, brothers who also own Broad Green Pictures, a Los Angeles film and television production venture. Gabriel Hammond did not respond to an emailed request for comment.  Alerian’s indexes track energy master limited partnerships (MLPs) and provide financial data on energy infrastructure projects in the United States. Terms of the deal included a $25 million breakup fee to Alerian if the transaction was not concluded by March 31. MLP investments have been hard-hit, first by the 2014 downturn in crude prices and more recently by regulatory and taxation shifts. The Alerian MLP Index is down 13 percent this year and major MLPs are restructuring from limited partnerships to traditional corporations.   ZZ Capital also has had a number of executive departures, including from its overseas investment department and international deal execution team, one of the sources said last week. In February, ZZ Capital disclosed its chief executive resigned and also released unaudited results for the nine months ended Dec. 31 showing its after-tax profit had slipped to HK $81.2 million ($10.3 million) from HK $95.4 million a year earlier. The company told Hong Kong regulators at the time that it would “pursue cost cutting as well as short-term income opportunities” in the quarter ending March 31.

2018-04-10,"PARIS (Reuters) - France’s President Emmanuel Macron took on critics of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Tuesday, saying it was too easy to criticise the young leader’s haste to reform and urged detractors to give him time. Prince Mohammed, who was ending a three-day tour to France on Tuesday, has won Western plaudits for seeking to reduce Saudi Arabia’s reliance on oil, tackle chronic corruption and transform the deeply conservative, mainly Sunni Muslim kingdom. But the severity and secrecy of an anti-corruption crackdown last November, after the prince ousted an older cousin as crown prince in a palace coup last June, has unnerved some investors. Human rights groups also question how far the kingdom has come. After a tense first exchange between the two leaders in Riyadh last November that was dominated by a difference of opinion on how to handle Riyadh’s regional rival Iran, Macron and Prince Mohammed sought to get to know each other and work on what they have in common rather than their differences. “I hear legitimate questions from civil society, journalists about human rights and various sensitive issues concerning your country, (but) I’m also looking at what’s going on in the region. We have here a young leader who is going to be in the highest functions in a country where 70 percent of the population is under 30,” Macron said alongside the 32-year-old prince. “We can have the choice to stick to our traditional positions and we can decide that the first acts of modernization of his society are cosmetic. If we do that then we are leaving Prince Mohammed to face those in his area that think the opposite and decide to go backwards and keep to a political Islam or terrorism,” he said.  Under the reforms closely associated with the crown prince, social restrictions have been loosened, such as bans on cinemas and women driving. He has promised to promote a more moderate form of Islam. During his visit to Paris, he met interfaith leaders and pushed for a new strategic partnership that in essence focused heavily on France’s cultural soft power and tourism know-how rather than signing billions of dollars worth of lucrative contracts as he had done in the United States and Britain. “You and I are old in Saudi Arabia because 70 percent of the population is younger than us,” Prince Mohammed joked during the news conference at the Elysee palace. Macron is only eight years older than the prince. “The partnership between Saudi Arabia and France is very important, especially now that Europe and the Middle East are going through changes in the world.” The two leaders also had some tense moments in November after Lebanese officials accused Saudi Arabia of holding Prime Minister Saad Hariri hostage in the kingdom. Macron eventually mediated a solution with Prince Mohammed to the problem, and on Tuesday the three dined at the Elysee palace with Hariri tweeting a selfie of the three of them.   While Macron made no specific references to human rights or freedoms in the kingdom, he had perhaps opted to push a more subtle message two days earlier in a private dinner and tour of the Louvre museum, including an exhibition of revolutionary 19th-century French painter Eugene Delacroix. A picture on Macron’s Twitter feed showed the two men contemplating Delacroix’ most famous painting, Liberty Leading The People, a bare-breasted woman standing over revolutionary barricades holding a French tricolour flag. “If there is one chance that his project succeeds, then it’s the responsibility of France to accompany him,” Macron said on Tuesday.

2018-04-10,"BAKU, April 11 (Reuters) - President Ilham Aliyev is expected to secure a fourth consecutive term in Azerbaijan’s election on Wednesday that opponents say has already been skewed in his favour. The former Soviet republic’s huge energy reserves and its strategic location along the Caspian Sea mean it is viewed by Europe as an important alternative to Russia for energy supplies. Opposition parties say they are boycotting the presidential vote because of Aliyev’s sustained crackdown on dissent during his rule and a likely rigging of electoral results. “We are not going to participate in this show,” Jamil Hasanly, head of the National Council of Democratic Forces, the Azeri opposition coalition, told Reuters. The 56-year-old Aliyev and his supporters deny allegations of vote fraud or that dissent has been suppressed. “Some political forces who decided to boycott the election have boycotted themselves as they were aware of their own defeat in advance,” Malakhat Ibragimova, a member of the ruling Yeni Azerbaijan Party, told Reuters. Aliyev, first elected president in 2003, two months before his ailing father and long-serving leader Heydar died, cemented his position with two referendums - one in 2009 that scrapped a two-term presidential limit, and another in 2016 that extended the presidential term of office to seven years from five. Aliyev brought forward the date of the latest vote to April 11 from Oct. 17, a move his allies said was necessary to avoid presidential and parliamentary elections clashing in 2025. Seven other candidates were running in Wednesday’s election, which will have international monitors including the Organisation for Cooperation and Security in Europe (OSCE), but critics questioned whether the other candidates were genuine. “Several OSCE ODIHR (Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights) interlocutors stated that the current legal framework and its implementation impede free election campaigning, noting previously voiced concerns over limitations to fundamental freedoms of expression, assembly and association,” the ODIHR said in a March 29 report. Aliyev has tried to strike a balance between big regional power Russia, Azerbaijan’s former Soviet master, and the West, notably on energy policy. His rule has benefited from an economic boom fuelled by oil exports but a slump in global crude prices in the last three years has weakened the Azeri currency and shrunk the economy. Many people in Azerbaijan are struggling on low incomes and amid a growing gap between rich and poor, and tensions are rising with neighbouring Armenia over a territorial conflict that caused a war in the 1990s. “I’m not going to vote as it’s very clear in advance that Ilham Aliyev will be elected as president,” said Gulshan Gajiyeva, a 20-year-old student. There are 5.2 million eligible voters in the country of 9 million people. The president is directly elected by an absolute majority of votes cast, with no turnout requirement. Polls open at 8 a.m. (0400 GMT) and close at 7 p.m. (1500 GMT). First official preliminary results are expected within hours of the polls closing.

2018-04-10,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity markets rose for the fifth session in six and the Japanese yen fell on Tuesday as Chinese President Xi Jinping’s promise to cut import tariffs eased investor concerns about an escalating trade spat between the United States and China. In a speech, Xi vowed to open China’s economy further, protect intellectual property of foreign firms and criticized a “Cold War mentality” as obsolete, in his first public comments since the trade dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration erupted. Later in the trading session in New York, Trump said via Twitter that he was “Very thankful for President Xi of China’s kind words on tariffs and automobile barriers.” Xi’s comments prompted a largely positive reaction in financial markets, which have been rattled on fears that tit-for-tat U.S.-China tariffs will escalate into a full-scale trade war that would threaten global growth. “What you are seeing in the market is an alleviation of trade war fears and people trying to get back in and reposition themselves for what they hope - no trade war,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 428.9 points, or 1.79 percent, to 24,408, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 43.71 points, or 1.67 percent, to 2,656.87 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 143.96 points, or 2.07 percent, to 7,094.30. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.87 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 1.36 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 1.05 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 1.24 percent higher, while Japan's Nikkei .N225 rose 0.54 percent. Oil markets gained sharply on hopes that the trade dispute may be resolved without greater damage to the global economy. “This has been another huge day,” said Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Futures in Chicago. “There’s soothing trade war fears, geopolitics, and a weaker dollar at play.” U.S. crude CLc1 rose 3.42 percent to $65.59 per barrel. Brent LCOc1 hit $71.34, the highest since December 2014, and was last at $71.00, up 3.42 percent on the day. Xi’s comments also lifted the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. “The main driver was the speech by China’s president overnight that helped to calm some concerns about a looming trade war,” said Omer Esiner, chief market strategist with Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. The Japanese yen weakened 0.37 percent versus the greenback at 107.16 per dollar, while Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.4174, up 0.32 percent on the day. The dollar index .DXY fell 0.23 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.28 percent to $1.2353. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR last fell 4/32 in price to yield 2.7991 percent, from 2.786 percent late on Monday. The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last fell 1/32 in price to yield 3.0182 percent, from 3.017 percent late on Monday. Russian assets extended Monday’s slide as investors digested the new round of U.S. sanctions targeting the country’s tycoons. The ruble plunged 3.7 percent against the dollar and touched 63.925 per dollar, its lowest since late 2016.

2018-04-10,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The spokesman for a Saudi-led coalition said on Tuesday that its military campaign in Yemen was not aimed at establishing a permanent presence along the country’s West coast but at restoring its internationally recognised government. A Yemeni official had told Reuters that Saudi Arabia and its main ally the United Arab Emirates would likely seek to remain deployed along the country’s Red Sea coast, where it is currently fighting an offensive against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement. “Saudi Arabia and UAE are very worried about Iran’s influence, so they are seeking to keep some military presence on the Yemeni coasts even if the civil war ends,” said the official who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. In a response to a request for comment, the coalition denied the allegation. “The coalition is working by all means to restore Yemen’s legitimacy so it can become stable and secure”, spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said in a statement. “The Yemeni Republic will restore its role in protecting its lands and territorial waters, as well as contributing to the maintenance of regional and international security,” he added. The kingdom and its mostly Gulf Arab allies intervened in a civil war in Yemen in 2015 to roll back the Houthis after they had pushed the government into Saudi exile. Coalition and Yemeni forces have been making modest territorial gains in recent months against the group in an armed push moving northward from the Bab al-Mandab strait toward the Houthi-held port city of Hodeidah. Yemen lies beside the southern mouth of the Red Sea, one of the most important trade routes in the world for oil tankers, which pass near Yemen’s shores while heading from the Middle East through the Suez Canal to Europe.

2018-04-10,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Rusal’s (0486.HK) dollar bonds slumped to record lows, two major customers said they were reviewing their contracts, and the London Metal Exchange distanced itself from the aluminium giant on Tuesday, in the latest aftershocks from U.S. sanctions. The sanctions imposed on Rusal and its boss, metals magnate Oleg Deripaska, mark the first time a major international company has been targeted by Washington in its moves to punish Russia for alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. While Russian markets, including the rouble, fell across the board on Monday, Rusal assets were hardest hit, with its Hong Kong-listed shares halving in value and the company warning it risked tipping into technical default. On Tuesday its dollar bonds maturing in 2023 fell 17.3 cents to a new low, according to TradeWeb. Their yields had previously been steady at around 6 percent, but on Tuesday spiked to 28.5 percent, a record high. XS1759468967=TE Swiss-based commodities trader Glencore (GLEN.L), a Rusal shareholder and one of its biggest customers, said it was evaluating the position under its contracts with Rusal in the light of the sanctions.  Glencore chief executive Ivan Glasenberg also resigned from his role as a Rusal director.  Deripaska’s companies have seen other resignations by non-Russian board members since the sanctions, with his newly created holding company En+ Group (ENPLq.L) saying board directors Dominique Fraisse and Zhao Guangming had quit on April 6 and 9 respectively. To offset the impact of the punitive measures, Rusal has triggered a contingency plan asking customers to pay in euros instead of U.S. dollars in a bid to skirt the sanctions, a source close to the matter said. This follows the example of Iran, which a few years ago opted to use gold, oil and the Japanese yen to pay for goods that would typically be priced in dollars. Glencore also said it was pulling back from earlier plans to swap its 8.75 percent stake in Rusal for global depository receipts in En+. “Glencore is committed to complying with all applicable sanctions in its business and is taking all necessary measures in order to mitigate any risks to Glencore’s business as a result of the designation of Rusal and En+ as SDNs (specially designated nationals), including in respect of secondary sanctions,” Glencore said in a statement. “Glencore will not proceed with the transaction at this time in light of the designation of Rusal and En+ as SDNs,” it said. Matt Chamberlain, the chief executive of the London Metal Exchange (LME), said the LME would take steps to keep aluminium produced by Rusal and sold after the sanctions were imposed out of its warehouses. Speaking in the Chilean capital, Chamberlain said aluminium that entered LME warehouses before the sanctions were imposed would not be affected. The websites of Rusal and En+ were down on Tuesday evening for unknown reasons. The U.S. sanctions explicitly bar U.S. entities from doing business with Rusal, but the impact extended to companies outside the United States too.  They are wary that Washington could slap so-called “secondary sanctions” on them if they are deemed to be facilitating Rusal’s business. Rio Tinto (RIO.L), a Rusal customer, said it was reviewing its trading relationship with the Russian firm.  “We will obviously do what we have to do to ensure that we comply with applicable sanctions,” Alf Barrios, Rio Tinto Aluminium’s chief executive, said in an interview. But the company said it was premature to speculate on the future of an Australian venture of which Rusal is part owner. Rusal owns 20 percent of Rio’s Queensland Alumina operation, and Rio owns the remaining 80 percent. According to a Rusal prospectus, its other major customers include Toyota (7203.T). Other foreign firms with ties to Deripaska’s empire include Austrian construction company Strabag, in which the Russian’s firm Rasperia has a blocking stake, and Singapore’s Changi Airports International, which is a partner with a Deripaska-owned airports firm. The sanctions are likely to mean Rusal is unable to pay the coupon, due on May 3, on one of its Eurobonds, putting the company in technical default on the paper, investors and analysts said. Rusal has the money to pay the coupon, which is the interest payment on the bond, but will be unable to make the payment because it will be blocked off from essential bond market infrastructure such as clearing services, trading platforms and correspondent banks, market participants said. The companies that provide those services are wary that, if they have to handle transactions relating to the Rusal bond, they too could come under sanctions risk. Almost all of Rusal’s $7.6 billion debt is dollar-denominated, making it difficult for the company to make repayments since the sanctions effectively cut off its access to the U.S. banking system and correspondent banks and creditors. Rusal declined to comment on Tuesday. On Monday, it said: “The company intends to continue to fulfil its existing commitments in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.” Reporting by Jack Stubbs and Andrey Ostroukh in MOSCOW, Abhinav Ramnarayan in LONDON and Peter Hobson in SANTIAGO; Writing by Polina Ivanova and Christian Lowe; Editing by Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-russia-sanctions-rusal/update-2-rusal-bonds-slump-customers-review-contracts-as-u-s-sanctions-bite-idUKL8N1RN64H,10 Apr 2018,"Rusal's dollar bonds

2018-04-10,"(Adds stock jump, additional details of layoffs) By Ernest Scheyder HOUSTON, April 10 (Reuters) - Devon Energy Corp said on Tuesday it would lay off 300 workers, roughly 9 percent of staff, part of a plan to streamline operations and boost the shale oil producer’s sagging returns and stock price. The cuts will affect all areas of the company’s operations, not just its Oklahoma City headquarters. Staff will be let go “in the weeks ahead,” Devon said in a statement. Shares of Devon jumped nearly 7 percent on Tuesday to close at $33.60 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock had been up about 5 percent earlier in the day, in line with broader markets and oil prices, but kept rising after the layoffs were announced. Devon, like many of its shale peers, has come under pressure from Wall Street in recent months to focus less on production and more on ways to boost shareholder returns. The company’s stock had, as of Tuesday’s close, lost more than 20 percent of its value in the past year despite a jump in oil prices. Devon said it expects the cuts to help save $150 million to $200 million by 2020. “The company must continue to sharpen its focus on core operations, increase its operating and financial efficiencies and align its workforce with this heightened focus to be as competitive and successful as possible in this environment,” Devon spokesman John Porretto said in a statement. Devon also laid off staff in 2016 as the oil industry grappled with oil prices nearly half of current levels. Chief Executive Dave Hager said last month that Devon had to shed assets of more than $5 billion to become a “lean, efficient company that drives high returns.” Devon, which operates in several large U.S. shale fields, also said last month that it would buy back $1 billion of its stock and raise its quarterly dividend by 33 percent after posting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings.

2018-04-10,"(Recasts; adds background) By Fergal Smith TORONTO, April 10 (Reuters) - The Canadian province of Saskatchewan, home to major potash and uranium reserves, said on Tuesday it would run a smaller deficit in the current fiscal year and balance its books in 2019-20 as it keeps a tight lid on spending despite projected higher commodity prices. Saskatchewan, which has endured a slump in its resource revenues in recent years, projected a C$365 million deficit for 2018-19, which follows a C$595 million deficit forecast for the fiscal year that ended on March 31. The 2018-19 projection does not include a contingency reserve. The right-leaning Saskatchewan Party, which controls a provincial majority and is led by Scott Moe, expects to run a modest C$6 million surplus in 2019-20 and then projects higher surpluses in future years. Moe was chosen in January to replace Brad Wall as party leader and the province’s premier. Wall retired after serving as premier for a decade. Saskatchewan is home to some of the world’s biggest potash and uranium reserves, which are mined by companies including Nutrien Ltd and Cameco Corp. The provincial government earns royalties from production of its mined resources as well as of crude oil. Saskatchewan forecast an average 2018 price for the crop nutrient of $190.43 per tonne, up from $180.58 last year. It expects the price of West Texas Intermediate oil in 2018 to average $59 per barrel, up from $50.78 per barrel in 2017. The province is Canada’s second largest oil producing province after Alberta. Spending is projected to rise 0.5 percent in 2018-19 to C$14.6 billion, while revenue is seen 2.2 percent higher at C$14.2 bln, helped by a predicted return to growth in the economy after contraction in 2015 and 2016. Taxation revenue is projected to climb 6.2 percent after the province last year bumped its sales tax up by 1 percent and applied it to more items in an effort to reduce its reliance on volatile resource revenues. The government said it will put on hold planned further reduction in personal income tax rates. Non-renewable resource revenue is projected to rise 4.4 percent to nearly C$1.5 billion. Still, that is C$1.1 billion lower than in 2014-15. Saskatchewan expects total public debt to climb by C$2.3 billion to C$20.0 billion, by March 31, 2019, due mostly to financing of infrastructure assets. At 15 percent in 2017-18, only British Columbia, among the provinces, has a lower net-debt as a share of gross domestic product. The budget comes just days after fifteen people were killed in the province when a bus carrying a Canadian junior ice hockey team collided with a truck, in one of the worst disasters to strike Canada’s sporting community.

2018-04-10,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices surged more than 3 percent on Tuesday as investors grew more confident the United States and China would resolve their trade dispute without damaging the global economy, while Middle East tensions and a weak dollar also supported prices.  Brent crude futures jumped $2.39, or 3.5 percent, to settle at $71.04 a barrel. This was its largest single-day percentage gain since September. In post-settlement trading, Brent hit $71.34, its highest since December 2014.  West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained 3.3 percent, or $2.09, to settle at $65.51 a barrel. “This has been another huge day,” said Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Futures in Chicago. “There’s soothing trade war fears, geopolitics, and a weaker dollar at play,” Baruch said.  President Xi Jinping on Tuesday promised to open China’s economy further and lower import tariffs, striking a conciliatory tone on the trade tensions between his country and the United States. Prices of both crude benchmarks have risen more than 5 percent in the past two trading days. Both have erased their losses from last week, when concerns over a possible trade war between the two largest economies contributed to declines of more than 4 percent. Middle East tensions also supported prices, said Phillip Streible, analyst at RJO Futures in Chicago.  “Oil markets are getting a bounce on increasing speculation about Trump and Syria,” Streible said. U.S. President Donald Trump promised a swift response to a suspected chemical attack in Syria. Such a response is likely to increase the push for the United States to exit the Iran nuclear deal, Streible said, given Iran’s support of the Syrian government.  Departures from the accord would result in renewed sanctions against Iran, which would hurt its oil industry.  Also supportive to crude prices was the weakness of the U.S. dollar. The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies, hitting its lowest in nearly two weeks. Because oil is dollar-priced, a stronger greenback makes purchases in other currencies more expensive. The American Petroleum Institute will publish its storage data later on Tuesday. Analysts anticipated a decline in crude and gasoline inventories.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration said it expected domestic crude oil production to rise by 750,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 11.44 million bpd next year, more than previously expected. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Ministry said it would keep exports below 7 million bpd and restore its inventories to normal levels.

Xi, speaking at a forum, vowed to open China’s economy further, protect intellectual property of foreign firms and he criticized a “Cold War mentality” as obsolete, in his first public comments since the trade dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration erupted. Later in the trading session in New York, Trump said via Twitter that he was “Very thankful for President Xi of China’s kind words regarding tariffs and automobile barriers.” Xi’s comments prompted a largely positive reaction in financial markets, which have been rattled on fears that tit-for-tat U.S.-China tariffs will escalate into a full-scale trade war that would threaten global growth. “What you are seeing in the market is an alleviation of trade war fears and people trying to get back in and reposition themselves for what they hope - no trade war,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 435.03 points, or 1.81 percent, to 24,414.13, the S&P 500 gained 43.22 points, or 1.65 percent, to 2,656.38 and the Nasdaq Composite added 130.92 points, or 1.88 percent, to 7,081.27. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.87 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.36 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 1.06 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.27 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.54 percent. Oil markets rose sharply on hopes that the trade dispute may be resolved without greater damage to the global economy. “This has been another huge day,” said Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Futures in Chicago. “There’s soothing trade war fears, geopolitics, and a weaker dollar at play.” U.S. crude rose 3.66 percent to $65.74 per barrel and Brent was last at $71.22, up 3.74 percent on the day. Xi’s comments also lifted the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. “The main driver was the speech by China’s President overnight that helped to calm some concerns about a looming trade war,” said Omer Esiner, chief market strategist with Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. The Japanese yen weakened 0.38 percent versus the greenback at 107.19 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.4181, up 0.37 percent on the day. The dollar index fell 0.26 percent, with the euro up 0.31 percent to $1.2357. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 4/32 in price to yield 2.7991 percent, from 2.786 percent late on Monday. The 30-year bond last /32 in price to yield 3.0174 percent, from 3.017 percent late on Monday. Russian assets extended Monday’s slide as investors digested the new round of U.S. sanctions targeting the country’s tycoons. The rouble plunged 3.9 percent against the dollar and touched 63.925 per dollar, its lowest since late 2016. Stocks in Moscow calculated in U.S. dollars fell as much as 4.8 percent after dropping more than 11 percent on Monday, but shaved most of Tuesday’s loss to end down 0.4 percent.

2018-04-10,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer denied the government was considering setting up a joint fund with carmakers to pay for exhaust systems to make diesel cars cleaner, citing legal and technical concerns about retrofitting older cars. Der Spiegel magazine reported last week the government could ask carmakers to contribute 5 billion euros ($6 billion) to such a fund, which would also include government payments. Scheuer told the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper on Tuesday  there had not yet been any discussion about funding, and he remained committed to meeting emissions targets using measures already being implemented and without costly hardware retrofits. “The discussion about hardware retrofits is not appropriate at this point, and definitely not with the participation of taxpayers,” he told the newspaper in an interview. The issue is being closely watched by major German carmakers Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler and BMW. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her cabinet are due to discuss vehicle emissions and how to avert driving bans during their cabinet retreat this week after Germany’s top administrative court ruled in February that local authorities could bar heavily polluting diesel cars. There has been a global backlash against diesel-engine cars since Volkswagen (VW) admitted in September 2015 to cheating U.S. exhaust tests. The scandal has spread across the industry and boosted investment in electric vehicles. Of the 15 million diesel cars in Germany, only 2.7 million are equipped with the latest Euro-6 emissions technology. Scheuer said there was “no reason to panic,” noting a combination of incentives and specific measures could help lower emissions in cities now exceeding permitted levels. He said software updates of some 5.3 million diesel cars to be completed by the auto industry by the end of the year would  reduce emissions by up to 30 percent. He said he had already released the first 20 million euros of 175 million euros in government subsidies to fund the acquisition of electric vehicles for public infrastructure agencies. The initial funds would pay for 2,000 such vehicles, he said.

2018-04-10,"(Adds details, quotes) DUBAI, April 10 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, plans to keep its crude oil shipments in May below 7 million barrels per day (bpd) for the 12th consecutive month, the Saudi Energy Ministry said on Tuesday. Saudi Arabia has been pumping below its OPEC target since January and reducing its crude shipments, particularly to the United States, as it turns its focus to cutting exports in an attempt to drain global oil stocks. “Allocations to international customers were kept under 7 million barrels a day despite nominations coming in higher than the previous month as demand picks up seasonally,” the ministry said in a statement. It gave no details on its production plan for May. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producers led by Russia have agreed to maintain oil output cuts until the end of 2018 aiming to reduce global inventories and boost oil prices. OPEC has made the five-year average its main target and managed to reduce the glut to around 74 million barrels above that benchmark, from above 300 million when the cuts began in 2017. A spokesman for the energy ministry said that Saudi Arabia “reiterates its steadfast commitment to restoring inventories back to their normal levels.” “Saudi Arabia continues to lead by example, producing less than its ceiling... despite seasonally rising domestic and international demand, and looks forward to all OPEC and participating non-OPEC countries maintaining or exceeding full conformity with their commitments.” Saudi Arabia also reported its March oil production at 9.91 million bpd, the ministry said. This is below the kingdom’s output target of 10.058 million bpd under the global supply cut agreement. OPEC has delivered more than 100 percent of the output cuts that members pledged under the deal, according to figures from OPEC and other analysts, helped in part by an involuntary drop in Venezuela, where output is falling amid an economic crisis. OPEC meets next in June to decide its output policy. Global oil producers agreed they should continue cooperating after their agreement expires at the end of this year, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Khalid al-Falih said in January.

2018-04-10,"(Adds detail) By Vladimir Soldatkin MOSCOW, April 10 (Reuters) - Future Russian gas transit flows through Ukraine to Europe may be between 10 and 15 billion cubic metres per year, Alexei Miller, head of Russian gas giant Gazprom, said on Tuesday, which is a significant decline from current levels. Miller issued his comments after German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the planned new Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany could not go ahead without clarity on Ukraine’s role as a transit route for gas. “We have never raised an issue about abandoning the Ukrainian transit. However, the Russian resource base has been moving northward and there won’t be the same resources in the central gas transportation corridor as it was in the past,” Miller said in a statement. “That’s why a certain transit could still be in place, in the amount of 10-15 bcm per year, but the Ukrainian side has to explain the viability of the new transit contract,” he said. He did not give a time frame for when the transit could be 10-15 bcm a year. Ukraine has been a key route for carrying Russian gas to Europe where it supplies around a third of gas needs, but Moscow and Kiev have clashed frequently over energy. Last year, the transit amounted to more than 93 bcm, while Gazprom’s total exports to Europe and Turkey reached an all-time high of 194 bcm. Last year, Ukraine earned around $3 billion in Russian gas transit fees. Gazprom said last month it would terminate its gas contracts with Ukraine after it lost a court case, escalating a dispute which had left Ukraine struggling to stay warm and which the European Union said could threaten gas flows to Europe. A Stockholm arbitration court ordered Gazprom in February to pay more than $2.5 billion to Ukrainian energy firm Naftogaz - a ruling meant to conclude a long legal battle that has run alongside Ukraine’s broader political stand-off with Russia. Gazprom wants to bypass Ukraine as an export route and plans to build two more undersea gas pipelines to Europe: TurkStream to Turkey and Nord Stream 2 to Germany. Eastern European and Baltic states fear Nord Stream 2, planned to run through the Baltic Sea, could increase reliance on Russian gas and undermine Ukraine’s role as a gas transit route. The plans for the pipelines were given new impetus after relations between Moscow and Kiev plunged as Russia-leaning president Viktor Yanukovich fled Ukraine in 2014 following street protests and a pro-Moscow revolt subsequently flared in eastern Ukraine. The current deal between Russia and Ukraine on gas purchases and transit expires at the end of 2019 and Kiev has been worrying about losing its transfer fees for shipping the Russian gas westwards to Europe.

The government raised its outlook for wheat and corn ending stocks, reflecting decreased demand for both grains from the feed and residual sector. Soybean futures rallied to their highest since March 9 after the report was released. Corn and wheat remained in negative territory. In its monthly supply and demand report, USDA pegged soybean ending stocks for the 2017-18 marketing year at 550 million bushels, down 5 million from its March estimate. It raised its estimate for soybeans used for crushing by 10 million bushels to 1.970 billion bushels. USDA left its U.S. soybean export forecast unchanged at 2.065 billion bushels. Analysts had been expecting soybean ending stocks of 574 million bushels, based on the average of estimates given in a Reuters poll. Despite USDA’s lower forecast, soybean ending stocks would still be the second-biggest total on record if realized. USDA also lowered its estimate for the Argentine soybean crop by 7 million tonnes to 40 million tonnes, and reduced its export outlook for that key South American supplier by 2.60 million tonnes to 4.20 million tonnes. “We are seeing some benefit from what’s happening with the short Argentina (soybean) crop, but not enough to offset the export business we lost in the first half of the marketing year,” said Arlan Suderman, analyst at INTL FCStone. “We need a late-year surge in export business just to hit USDA’s current target.” The harvest outlook for Brazil was raised to 115 million tonnes from 113 million tonnes. Brazil soybean exports were pegged at 73.10 million tonnes, up 2.60 million tonnes from USDA’s March outlook. For corn, USDA raised its domestic ending stocks outlook to 2.182 billion bushels, up from 2.127 billion in March. USDA lowered corn usage in the feed and residual category by 50 million bushels and by 5 million bushels in the food, seed and industrial category. The government also lowered its estimate of both Brazil’s and Argentina’s corn harvests and said that reduced competition was expected to impact U.S. exports during the first half of the 2018-19 marketing year.

2018-04-10,"MOSCOW, April 10 (Reuters) - Rusal’s dollar bonds slumped to record lows and a prominent board member resigned on Tuesday in the latest aftershocks from the Russian aluminium giant’s inclusion last week on a new U.S. sanctions list. The measures against Rusal and its boss, metals magnate Oleg Deripaska, mark the first time a major international company has been targeted by Washington in its moves to punish Russia for alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. While Russian markets, including the rouble, fell across the board on Monday, Rusal assets were hardest hit, with its Hong Kong listed shares halving in value and the company warning it risked tipping into technical default. On Tuesday its dollar bonds maturing in 2023 fell 17.3 cents to a new record low, according to TradeWeb. Its yield had previously been steady at around 6 percent, but on Tuesday it spiked to 28.5 percent, a record high. Meanwhile, Rusal board member Ivan Glasenberg, who is chief executive of Swiss-based trader Glencore, resigned on Tuesday, Glencore said. Deripaska’s companies have seen other resignations by non-Russian board members since the sanctions, with his newly-created holding company En+ Group saying board directors Dominique Fraisse and Zhao Guangming had quit on April 6 and 9 respectively. As a major Rusal shareholder, Glencore added it was carefully considering how to protect its business and said it was pulling back from earlier plans to swap its 8.75 percent of Rusal for Global Depository Receipts in En+. “Glencore is committed to complying with all applicable sanctions in its business and is taking all necessary measures in order to mitigate any risks to Glencore’s business as a result of the designation of Rusal and EN+ as SDNs (specially designated nationals), including in respect of secondary sanctions,” Glencore said in a statement. “Glencore will not proceed with the Transaction at this time in light of the designation of Rusal and EN+ as SDNs,” it said.

2018-04-10,"(Reuters) - Vivo Energy, the African fuels supplier owned by oil trading giant Vitol and Helios Investment Partners, will float on the London Stock Exchange and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the company said on Tuesday.        The public offering of the company, which sells Shell-branded (RDSa.L) fuels and lubricants in 15 African countries, is one of a string of large listings expected in Europe, which is on course for its busiest start to the year since 2015. Vitol’s European refining and downstream venture, Varo Energy, was also expected to float in Amsterdam this year, but in an announcement later on Tuesday, Varo said it had canceled those plans due to poor market conditions.  Prior to Vivo’s float, Britvic (BVIC.L) Chairman John Daly will become chairman of Vivo, the company announced. Vivo, established in December 2011 through the carve-out of Shell’s African downstream business, is wholly owned by Vitol, the world’s largest oil trader, and Helios, an Africa-focused private investment firm. It reported adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of $376 million in 2017, up from $302 million a year earlier. Since the 2011 takeover, Vivo has spent $600 million on expanding its retail network and sold 9 billion liters of fuel and lubricants in 2017 – nearly 40 percent more than when it took over. “We have shown that we are going to continue our growth story and create more value for investors. If you want to attract investors, you want to do it where governance is really strong and London is known for that. And we also wanted to stay in Africa because we are a pan-African retail company,” CEO Christian Chammas told Reuters. After the completion of an acquisition later this year, Vivo will be active in 24 of 54 countries on the continent, which its management said provided a natural hedge against political turbulence, conflict and currency swings. The company expects to have a free float of at least 25 percent on admission, expected in May, after which it is also expected to be able to join FTSE UK indices.  According to a bookrunner, the selling shareholders will include Vitol Africa B.V and no proceeds of the listing will go to the company. JPMorgan (JP.N), Citigroup (C.N) and Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) are leading the listing.

2018-04-10,"(Updates prices, changes dateline from previous LONDON) * Stocks up as Xi seen conciliatory on trade * Russian rouble touches lowest since late 2016 versus USD * Oil adds almost 3 pct as trade war fears ebb By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, April 10 (Reuters) - Global equity markets rallied and the Japanese yen fell on Tuesday as Chinese President Xi Jinping’s promise to cut import tariffs eased investor concerns about an escalating U.S.-China trade row. Speaking at the Boao Forum for Asia in China’s Hainan province, Xi vowed to open China’s economy further, protect intellectual property of foreign firms and he criticized a “Cold War mentality” as obsolete, in his first public comments since the trade dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration erupted. Xi’s comments prompted a largely positive reaction in financial markets, which have been rattled on fears that tit-for-tat U.S.-China tariffs will escalate into a full-scale trade war that would threaten global growth. “The expectation was this could have gone one of two ways: he could have been aggressive about U.S. tariffs or been conciliatory, and it feels like he’s more conciliatory,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 481.37 points, or 2.01 percent, to 24,460.47, the S&P 500 gained 42.97 points, or 1.64 percent, to 2,656.13 and the Nasdaq Composite added 116.44 points, or 1.68 percent, to 7,066.79. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.84 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.29 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 0.93 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.17 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.54 percent. Oil markets rose sharply on hopes that the trade dispute may be resolved without greater damage to the global economy. “It’s not so much ‘risk on/risk off’, as it is ‘trade war on/trade war off’ and, at the moment, we’re ‘trade-war off’,” London Capital Group’s Jasper Lawler said. “There’s a lot of political motivation in the tariffs in the United States, but ultimately, they won’t want a trade war, there is a general desire to boost the U.S. economy.” U.S. crude rose 2.82 percent to $65.21 per barrel and Brent was last at $70.68, up 2.96 percent on the day. Xi’s comments also lifted the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. “The main driver was the speech by China’s President overnight that helped to calm some concerns about a looming trade war,” said Omer Esiner, chief market strategist with Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. The Japanese yen weakened 0.53 percent versus the greenback at 107.35 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.4158, up 0.21 percent on the day. The dollar index fell 0.06 percent, with the euro up 0.07 percent to $1.2328. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 4/32 in price to yield 2.7991 percent, from 2.786 percent late on Monday. The 30-year bond last fell 4/32 in price to yield 3.0238 percent, from 3.017 percent late on Monday. Russian assets extended Monday’s slide as investors digested the new round of U.S. sanctions targeting the country’s tycoons. The rouble plunged 3.7 percent against the dollar and touched 63.925 per dollar, its lowest since late 2016. Stocks in Moscow calculated in U.S. dollars fell as much as 4.8 percent after dropping more than 11 percent on Monday, but shaved most of Tuesday’s loss to be down -0.8 percent. Shares of Rusal, the aluminum giant highlighted prominently in the sanctions alongside its boss Oleg Deripaska, fell a further 8.7 percent in Hong Kong after slumping 50 percent on Monday.

2018-04-10,"(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is in talks with Qatar over a possible deal that could see the country investing in the company’s U.S. shale gas resources, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The deal could take the shape of a joint venture in which Qatar, through state-owned Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL], could partner or invest in future wells with Exxon's XTO Energy subsidiary, the newspaper said on.wsj.com/2HoPiyj. The newspaper said no deal had been finalized yet and talks could collapse. The newspaper did not say how much Qatar was planning to invest in XTO Energy. If the deal takes shape as described, it would be the first time a Middle Eastern country invested significantly in a U.S. shale-related project. Exxon, which is targeting Qatar for additional investments in liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects reut.rs/2qn9FUr, already partners with Qatar Petroleum in Cyprus and Brazil. Exxon spokeswoman Rebecca Arnold declined to comment on the newspaper’s report. A representative for Qatar Petroleum was not immediately available to comment. Mohammed Saleh Al Sada, Qatar’s minister of energy and economy, declined to comment on the newspaper’s report when asked by Reuters at an industry event in India. Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani is set to meet U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Wednesday. The shale revolution in the United States has not only seen a huge rise in crude production, but also in gas output. Exxon, already the second-largest U.S. natural gas producer, said earlier this year it is aiming to triple production in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico to 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2025. For Qatar, which is locked in a dispute with Saudi Arabia,  the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, the move could help broaden its investments outside the Middle East.  Qatar is one of the smallest producers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and also one of the most influential players in the global LNG market due to its annual production of 77 million tonnes, cementing its position as the world’s largest LNG supplier. Qatar Petroleum is majority owner of the Golden Pass LNG terminal in Texas, with Exxon and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) holding smaller stakes.

2018-04-10,"NANTES, France (Reuters) - Researchers have unveiled what they billed as the world’s first 3D-printed house to serve as a home in the French city of Nantes, with the first tenants due to move in by June.  Academics at the University of Nantes who led the project said it was the first house built in situ for human habitation using a robot 3D-printer. The robot, known as BatiPrint3D, uses a special polymer material that should keep the building insulated effectively for a century. It took BatiPrint3D around 18 days to complete its part of the work on the house - creating hollow walls that were subsequently filled with concrete for insulation.  “Is this the future? It’s a solution and a constructive principle that is interesting because we create the house directly on site and in addition thanks to the robot, we are able to create walls with complex shapes,” said Benoit Furet, a professor who worked on the project. The 95 square metre (1000 square feet), five-room house will be allocated to a local family which qualifies for social housing, authorities said. The Y-shaped home is equipped with multiple sensors that monitor air quality, humidity and temperature, as well as equipment to evaluate and analyse the thermal properties of the building. Researchers believe this technology will enable tenants to save on energy costs.  Authorities in Nantes are planning further 3D-printed building projects, including a public reception building and a housing estate.

2018-04-10,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will meet on Tuesday with his cabinet ministers to discuss Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd’s (KML.TO) threat to walk away from a troubled pipeline expansion as various levels of government signal interest in spending public funds to ensure the project proceeds. The company, losing patience with moves by politicians and activists to block plans to almost triple the capacity of its Trans Mountain pipeline, is vowing to halt all work on May 31 unless the challenges can be resolved. The 90-minute cabinet meeting is due to start at 3 p.m. (1900 GMT). The pipeline carries crude from Alberta’s oil sands to the Pacific province of British Columbia. The issue is a major political challenge for Trudeau, who approved the expansion plan in 2016. Critics have said he needs to be more forceful with the provincial government in British Columbia, which is vowing to do all it can to halt the project. Alberta premier Rachel Notley, asked by the Calgary Herald newspaper whether her government would buy out Kinder Morgan Canada’s stake in the pipeline if necessary, replied: “That’s what we’d do.” The newspaper quoted her as saying she was “determined that the province, hopefully with Ottawa as co-investor, would control the project” in case the company bailed. Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said on Monday that Ottawa was looking at whether to take a stake. “We are doing an assessment of what might be necessary, working with the government of Alberta,” Carr told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. The government is “looking at all options including legal, regulatory and financial options,” a spokesman for Carr said. Shares of Kinder Morgan Canada stabilized on Tuesday and were up 2.1 percent at C$16.62 in early morning trade after shedding 12.6 percent on Monday. Political observers have said Trudeau is unlikely to crack down too harshly on British Columbia for fear of antagonizing voters ahead of a federal election set for October 2019.

2018-04-10,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Nestle wants to make all of its packaging recyclable or reusable by 2025, the Swiss food giant said on Tuesday, becoming the latest food company to vow to reduce plastic waste. Environmentalists criticised the plan as lacking substance. European governments have stepped up efforts to reduce plastic waste littering land and sea, and companies across the food supply chain are following suit. UK supermarket chain Waitrose [JLPLC.UL] pledged on Tuesday to ban disposable coffee cups from its shops by this autumn.   “Plastic waste is one of the biggest sustainability issues the world is facing today. Tackling it requires a collective approach,” Nestle Chief Executive Mark Schneider said in a statement. The world’s biggest packaged food company said it would focus on eliminating non-recyclable plastics, encourage the use of plastics that allow better recycling rates and eliminate or change complex combinations of packaging materials.  “We are working on changing the colours used for our plastic packaging. Lighter colours are easier to recycle,” Nestle sustainability expert Duncan Pollard told reporters on a call. Environmental group Greenpeace said Nestle had missed giving clear quantitative targets on the reduction of plastic waste, calling the announcement “greenwashing”.  “The company is one of the parties responsible for the serious plastic crisis in the oceans,” Greenpeace Switzerland spokesman Yves Zenger said in a statement, adding Nestle should ultimately completely renounce single-use plastic packaging. Nestle’s Pollard said on the call the recycling of single-use plastics depended on there being a recycling infrastructure in place and particularly countries in South-East Asia, such as the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, had to make improvements in this area.     Nestle rival Unilever said last week it had struck a partnership to pioneer a new technology which converts PET (polyethylene terephthalate) waste back into virgin-grade material for use in food packaging. The company already committed last year to making all of its plastic packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. Coffee chain Starbucks is doing its bit by offering customers a discount on their drink if they bring in their own tumbler or cup.  The British government announced plans last month to introduce a deposit return scheme for single-use drink containers and EU regulators have said they want to increase recycling of plastic, after China banned imports of “foreign garbage” from the start of 2018.

2018-04-10,"MOSTAR, Bosnia, April 10 (Reuters) - Serbia’s president called on western Balkan countries to settle their differences and create a common market to attract badly needed foreign investment. Armed conflict in the Balkans ended more than 18 years ago, but five of the states that emerged after the former Yugoslavia broke up - Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo and Serbia - still have border disputes to settle. All five, along with Albania, hope to join the European Union, which has called on them to settle their disputes before they join, but little progress has been made. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic told a business fair in the Bosnian town of Mostar the six need to work more closely to create a better investment climate. “Split into small states and even smaller markets, we have nothing to look and hope for. Our only chance to catch up with the rest of the world is in creating a much bigger market in the future,” Vucic said. He said economic cooperation could also help build stability and peace in the region, where persistent ethnic tensions still block economic progress. “Such a market could attract more investors, open bigger projects, create jobs and fuel growth and development,” Vucic said. To create the market, the six countries need to lift barriers to the flow of goods and people, harmonise taxes and abolish fiscal charges, Vucic said. Such measures could attract up to 15 billion euros in investment in coming years, more than triple their current value, he said. Our businessmen need it more than our politicians,” Vucic said - operating costs for companies whose trucks wait as long as 30 hours more than necessary to cross borders have increased by 7 percent. But to create a common market, Belgrade would need to resolve all outstanding issues with Kosovo, among others. Little progress has been made there despite EU meditation — Belgrade still refuses to recognise Kosovo’s independence. The idea of a common market has drawn a mixed response in the region. Some of the countries fear it would be dominated by Serbia. “It would mean a lot for boosting economic ties,” said Pane Skrbic, a member of the European Association of Managers. “The businessmen have been erasing these borders much more easily than politicians.

2018-04-10,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - A rare public appearance by veteran Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika is fuelling speculation he will run for a fifth term next year, a move that would mean at least short-term stability for a key U.S. ally and one of Europe’s main gas suppliers. Bouteflika has largely disappeared from public view since a stroke in 2013 so his appearance on Monday to open a restored mosque and two metro stations is seen as a sign the country’s ruling elite want him to stay on to avoid an unclear succession. In power since 1999, the visibly frail, wheelchair-bound 81-year-old saluted a crowd outside the Ketchaoua Mosque in the capital Algiers waving national flags and holding placards with photos of the president. Bouteflika’s appearance also came two days after the ruling National Liberation Front (FLN) called on him to run again and as state media sought to dispel doubts about his health by showcasing his past meetings with foreign dignitaries. While another term for Bouteflika would give a ruling caste of FLN officials, generals and business tycoons time to organise a smooth succession, it is likely to be a source of frustration for young Algerians worried about unemployment and austerity in a state-controlled economy suffering from low oil prices. “I do not care about politics and politicians. Bouteflika running for a fifth term, a sixth term, or not? Not my problem,” said Amin Ferrah, a 22-year-old student who works in a pizzeria. “Politics is not my world.” In a country where about half the population is under 25, many young Algerians are looking abroad. Ferrah wants to go to Canada while others have taken the perilous sea crossing to Europe. The government has said it wants to diversify the economy away from oil and gas, which accounts for 60 percent of budget finances, but there has been resistance from those within the ruling elite to opening up to foreign investment. The key decision makers in Algeria are veterans who fought from 1954-1962 against French occupation and fiercely oppose what they call foreign interference. That has left the economy dominated by the state and firms run by business tycoons. Opponents say Algeria needs a national dialogue to overcome what they call “the gravity of the situation”, a veiled call on the country’s power brokers to assess Bouteflika’s health. “Our country has never been in such a delicate situation, carrying such a great risk of breaking civil peace, stability and national security as it is now,” Ali Benflis, a leading opposition figure who ran against Bouteflika in 2004 and 2014, told reporters a month ago. Benflis was referring to strikes by teachers and doctors that have been running for months because the government has been unable to offer them more cash as it has done in the past because the fall in oil prices has stretched public finances. Energy revenues have halved since 2014 and the government has launched austerity measures, banning the import of 900 goods and freezing public sector hiring and development projects. Bouteflika has not said he wants to run again but previous presidential campaigns have followed similar statements from the FLN calling on him to continue. Bouteflika’s supporters say his mind remains sharp, even though he needs a microphone to speak. “The president enjoys all his mental and intellectual abilities,” Lakhdar Brahimi, a retired U.N diplomat and close friend said in a recent interview with local media. “His memory is very strong. And it’s him sometimes who reminds me of dates and people,” he said. “Except for his dead voice, he is in good shape and he rules the country.” Bouteflika is part of a thinning elite of the veterans who fought France in the independence war and have run Algeria ever since. Many also credit him with ending a civil war with Islamists in the 1990s that killed 200,000 people. He is unlikely to face competition from within ruling circles. Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia, leader of the National Rally for Democracy (RND) allied to the FLN, has already said he will not run if Bouteflika goes for a fifth term. Analysts say the opposition, fractured between moderate Islamists and left-wing groups, is also unlikely to mount a serious challenge in presidential elections expected in the first half of 2019. No date has been set yet. In addition, thousands of former Islamist fighters who accepted a partial amnesty to end the civil war could be potential Bouteflika supporters if he runs again. While the fighters did not get any political rights under the original deal, Bouteflika is now expected to offer them full rights. Nobody has yet said they will run against Bouteflika, even though the president has said he wants more competition. He won with 82 percent of the vote in 2014, 90 percent in 2009, 85 percent in 2004 and 74 percent in 1999. “The political scene must experience diversity, a confrontation of programmes, and a race to power,” Bouteflika said last month in a letter read out by an adviser.

2018-04-10,"(Adds details, quotes) By Elias Biryabarema KAMPALA, April 10 (Reuters) - Uganda signed an agreement on Tuesday with a consortium, including a subsidiary of America’s General Electric, to build and operate an oil refinery in western Uganda that will cost $3 billion-$4 billion, the president’s office said. According to a statement, the project framework agreement that was signed will “ensure development, design, financing, construction, operation and maintenance” of the planned 60,000-barrel-a-day refinery. Uganda discovered crude reserves estimated by government geologists at 6.5 billion barrels in the Albertine rift basin along its border with the Democratic Republic of Congo more than 10 years ago. But the start of production has been repeatedly delayed by disagreements with field operators UK’s Tullow Oil, China’s CNOOC and France’s Total over taxes and development strategy. A lack of associated infrastructure such as a crude transportation pipeline and a refining facility have also hampered the start of production. The east African country is aiming to both refine domestically and also export some of the crude via a pipeline through neighbouring Tanzania currently under development. Uganda has said it is eyeing the start of commercial production in 2020. According to the statement, members of the consortium are Albertine Graben Refinery Consortium (AGRC) include Nuovo Pignone International SRL, a General Electric subsidiary in Italy. Others include YAATRA Africa and Lionworks Group Ltd both from Mauritius and Saipem Spa also from Italy. “There has been sleeping in the West, they don’t care about what potential is in Africa,” the statement quoted Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni as saying at the signing ceremony at Entebbe, a lakeside town where his office is located. “Africa is going to be a huge powerhouse in terms of business.” Initial efforts to secure an investor for the refinery collapsed after talks with Russia’s RT Global Resources broke down.

2018-04-10,"ABOARD THE USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT, South China Sea, April 10 (Reuters) - I n a span of 20 minutes, 20 F-18 fighter jets took off and landed on the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier, in a powerful display of military precision and efficiency. The nuclear-powered warship, leading a carrier strike group, was conducting what the U.S. military called routine training in the disputed South China Sea on Tuesday, headed for a port call in the Philippines, a defence treaty ally. The United States is not alone in carrying out naval patrols in the strategic waterway, where Chinese, Japanese and some Southeast Asian navies operate, possibly increasing tensions and risking accidents at sea. “We have seen Chinese ships around us,” Rear Admiral Steve Koehler, the strike group commander, told a small group of reporters on board the three-decade-old carrier. “They are one of the navies that operate in the South China Sea but I would tell you that we have seen nothing but professional work out of the ships we have encountered.” Navies in the western Pacific, including China and nine Southeast Asian countries, have been working on a code of unexpected encounters (CUES) at sea to avoid conflict. The USS Theodore Roosevelt’s presence in the South China Sea comes days after China’s massive air and naval drills in the area, in what some analysts described as an unusually large display of Beijing’s growing naval might. China’s growing military presence in the waters has fuelled concern in the West about Beijing’s end game. The United States has criticised China’s apparent militarisation of manmade islands and carried out regular air and naval patrols to assert its right to freedom of navigation in stretches of a sea China claims largely as its own. “This transit in the South China Sea is nothing new in our planning cycle or in a reaction to that. It is probably by happenstance that all that is happening at the same time,” said Koehler, who gave a tour of the carrier to Philippine military officials and watched flight operations aboard the 100,000-tonne warship. “All of the operations that we do in and around the South China Sea or any of the bodies of water we operate in, there is a function of international law and that is ultimately what we want to recognise,” Koehler said. Tension between the United States and China over trade and territory under U.S. President Donald Trump has been stepped up of late, with fear in the region that the South China Sea, vital to global trade, could one day become a battleground between the two rival powers. Philippine ties with China have meanwhile warmed under President Rodrigo Duterte, who has put aside disputes with Beijing and wants it to play a key role in building and funding urgently needed infrastructure, from highways and ports to railways and power plants. China has long objected to U.S. military operations off its coasts, even in areas Washington insists are free to international passage. “They (China) certainly have the right to exercise off their coast like we do, nor are they necessarily in charge of our transit cycle, but our deployment’s been planned,” Koehler said. As the crew in colour-coded uniforms raced to service dozens of aircraft taking off and landing, “handlers” in the flight deck control made sure the deck had enough room for jets to manoeuvre and refuel with the help of a “Ouija board”. The board has all the models of each aircraft, which are marked with squadron name, model, make, and number of personnel. At any given moment, the flight deck is home to dozens of aircraft and helicopters. “It is a showcase of the capability of the U.S. armed forces,” Philippine army chief Rolando Bautista said of the demonstration. “Since Americans are our friends in one way or another, they can help us deter any threat.” (Editing by Martin Petty and Nick Macfie)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/southechinasea-usa/after-chinas-massive-drill-u-s-patrols-disputed-south-china-sea-idUKL3N1RN4JH,10 Apr 2018,"I n a span of 20 minutes, 20 F-18 fighter jets took

2018-04-10,"LONDON (Reuters) - (John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own.) Trade tensions between the United States and China are likely to have an adverse impact on global growth even if the threatened tariffs are never imposed. Conflict between the world’s two largest economies is creating significant uncertainty for businesses that threatens their global supply chains and future investment plans. Senior U.S. officials have emphasized the tariffs are only a proposal at this stage and could be averted by a settlement between the two countries. But the disjunction between hardline rhetoric and aggressive tariff proposals on the one hand and reassurance to investors and businesses on the other has whipsawed the financial markets. Equity indices and commodity prices have alternated between selloffs and rallies as traders try to estimate the probability tariffs will be imposed. In reality, the direct economic damage done by tariffs would be fairly small, though the impact on some firms and sectors would be more concentrated. Bilateral trade of around $700 billion between the two countries represents only a small percentage of the gross domestic production of the United States ($19 trillion) and China ($11 trillion). But the threat of tariffs will have a much more damaging and chilling impact on investment decisions that depend on global supply chains - even if the import taxes are never actually imposed. For multinational businesses considering the location of new manufacturing facility, the threat of tariffs is likely to cause at least an additional pause before the project is given the go-ahead. If decisions are delayed, the result will be a slowdown in investment, at least in the short term, with negative implications for growth. U.S. officials have indicated it could take six months or more to reach a final decision on tariffs which implies an extended period of damaging uncertainty. The damage will extend well beyond decisions on the location of new automotive plants and semiconductor factories. Most major construction projects and manufacturing systems depend on raw materials and components that cross international borders at least once and in some cases multiple times. Raw materials, components and finished goods generally have to be ordered many months or even years in advance. Projected costs depend on estimates of the price of items ordered now, but which may not arrive and clear customs until many months in the future, when they could be liable to new tariffs. Every business relying on items from one of the countries engaged in a potential trade war must calculate the risk the items will be unavailable or significantly more expensive and make contingency plans accordingly. DE-GLOBALIZATION? Even if a truce is declared in the current trade spat, it has raised major questions about the future direction of trade and investment policies. Since 1947, the broad thrust of international economic policies has been towards greater openness to trade and investment, led by the United States. Successive rounds of trade negotiations have lowered average tariff barriers and tried to control non-tariff barriers on trade and investment to create a more predictable environment for business. Officials conducted eight successful rounds of multinational trade negotiations between 1947 and 1994 under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In addition, there have been several ambitious attempts to liberalize regional trade, notably the European Union and the North American Free Trade Agreement, as well as a dense network of bilateral free trade agreements. Protectionism has never been far from the surface but the broad trend has been in the direction of greater liberalization. The liberalization thrust has seemed to run out of momentum in recent years with the failure to conclude a new round of global trade negotiations. The tariff war now threatens to send the process into reverse. Proponents of tariffs have made explicitly clear they want to revive U.S. manufacturing by cutting global supply chains and re-nationalizing them. This marks a major change in the direction of the international economic system and could upend corporate strategies that have been based on global supply chain management. The results could leave hundreds of billions of dollars of foreign investments as stranded assets if multinationals are forced to reconfigure their supply networks. The potential for asset stranding and write-downs helps explain why stock markets have reacted so badly to the threat of tariffs even when their direct economic impact would be limited. The threat of a trade war has injected an extra degree of uncertainty that will not necessarily be lifted even if the two sides reach a settlement. It comes at a time when Britain is withdrawing from the European Union and international sanctions are also proliferating and disrupting the operation of supply chains for energy and minerals. And there is no guarantee another tariff war will not break out in future over another issue. Corporate leaders must plan for a world in which greater openness to trade and investment is no longer a given. Trade tensions between the United States and China have revealed the shallowness of political support for the current open trading system let alone further liberalization. Whatever the merits of the current dispute, the threat of tariffs has injected a significant additional source of uncertainty into the global economy that is likely to inhibit investment and output growth. The tariff war is a sign the post-war project of trade liberalization is in deep trouble and the impact could linger even if the United States and China can negotiate a truce.

2018-04-10,"(Adds quotes, details) By Rania El Gamal ABU DHABI, April 10 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) said on Tuesday it was launching a competitive exploration and production licensing round for six oil and gas blocks, its first ever. Two of the six blocks are offshore and four are onshore and estimates suggest they contain substantial amounts of oil and gas, ADNOC said in a statement. The successful bidders will enter into agreements granting exploration and development rights under terms that will be set out in the bidding package, it added. ADNOC has embarked on a major plan to privatize its services businesses, venture into oil trading and expand partnerships with strategic investors. The shake-up aims to make ADNOC more competitive and commercially focused, operating in a way that is more akin to other state-controlled peers. “The launch of these large new licensing blocks is an important step for Abu Dhabi and ADNOC as we develop and apply new strategies to realize the full potential of our resources, maximize value through competitive bidding and accelerate the exploration and development of new commercial opportunities,” ADNOC’s Chief Executive Sultan al-Jaber said. Bids are due by October and the first bidding round is expected to conclude this year. The six blocks comprise a total area of around 30,000 square kilometres. The blocks hold multi-billion barrels of oil and multi- trillion cubic feet of natural gas, Abdulmunim al-Kindy, head of upstream at ADNOC, said at a press conference in Abu Dhabi to announce the bidding round. A global technical and commercial roadshow for the new round will start on April 23 in Abu Dhabi. This will be followed by others in North American, European and Asian cities such as Houston on April 26, and Hong Kong on May 8, ADNOC said. Al-Jaber said ADNOC had received an overwhelming response to the bidding round from energy companies, both existing and new partners. He did not name any interested parties. ADNOC is to maintain a 60 percent share during the production phase for the blocks, he added. ADNOC pumps around 3 million barrels of oil per day, or about 3 percent of global production. It also produces more than 9.8 billion cubic feet of raw gas per day, placing it among the largest energy producers in the world.

2018-04-10,"LONDON, April 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - British supermarket Waitrose, food giant Nestle and accounting firm KPMG on Tuesday became the latest brands to announce plans to cut down on plastics wreaking havoc on the environment. Waitrose, an upmarket grocer that treats loyal shoppers with free tea or coffee at its stores, said it will stop using disposable cups - which are very hard to recycle - this year. Customers will continue to get their free coffee fix if they bring their own reusable cup, the company said in a statement. “We believe removing all takeaway disposable cups is the right thing to do for our business and are confident the majority of customers will support the environmental benefits,” Tor Harris, the supermarket’s head of sustainability, said. The shift by some of the biggest high-street names answers widespread consumer disquiet over pollution, accelerated after popular British naturalist David Attenborough urged consumers to stop using plastic bottles in his “Blue Planet II” TV series. In January, privately-owned Iceland pledged to eliminate plastic packaging from its own-brand products by the end of 2023 - a first by a major British grocer. KPMG said it would phase out the use of plastic water cups and cutlery at its 22 offices around Britain by the end of the year, after a successful trial in Manchester where employees were given metal water bottles to use instead. The global accounting firm said it uses about 3 million plastic cups every year, costing 60,000 pounds ($85,000). “Even with supplying each of our 15,000 employees with a free metal water bottle, the scheme is projected to pay for itself within 18 months,” KPMG’s environment manager Sarah Lindsay said in a statement. Separately, Nestle, which owns more than 2,000 brands worldwide from chocolate snacks like KitKat and Smarties to Perrier bottled water, announced it aims to make all of its packaging recyclable or re-usable by 2025. “Plastic waste is one of the biggest sustainability issues the world is facing today,” Nestle chief executive Mark Schneider, said in a statement. United Nations figures show 8 million tonnes of plastic - bottles, packaging and other waste - enter the ocean each year, degrading precious habitats, killing marine life and entering the human food chain. Scientists have urged tougher restrictions on plastic waste. In December, almost 200 nations agreed to limit plastic pollution of the oceans, warning it could outweigh fish by 2030. $1 = 0.7064 pounds

Russian assets extended Monday’s slide as investors digested the new round of U.S. sanctions targeting the country’s tycoons. The rouble plunged more than 4 percent against the dollar to its lowest since late-2016. Speaking at the Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan province, Xi vowed to open China’s economy further, protect intellectual property of foreign firms and he criticised a “Cold War mentality” as obsolete, in his first public comments since the trade dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration erupted. Xi’s comments prompted a largely positive reaction in financial markets, which have been rattled over the past week on fears the tit-for-tat U.S.-China tariffs will escalate into a full-scale trade war that would threaten global growth. European markets followed Asia with solid gains. Germany’s DAX rose 0.8 percent, France’s CAC 40 0.51 percent and Britain’s FTSE 100 0.59 percent. The U.S. S&P 500 E-mini futures gained 1.15 percent, suggesting U.S. shares would open positively. The MSCI World Index rose 0.34 percent. “In the current environment markets are grabbing at the slightest hint. Today’s message from Xi contained nothing really new but it seemed like a conciliatory tone and so the market is just grabbing at that,” said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen. “It goes back to the fact that there is still uncertainty on trade wars and even if we get a slight indication that it won’t be the worst case scenario, the market reacts positively,” he said, while predicting ongoing trade tensions throughout 2018. Oil markets rose sharply on hopes that the trade dispute may be resolved without greater damage to the global economy. Brent crude futures climbed more 2 percent to $70.12. After trading flat for most of the day, the euro surged when European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny told Reuters that the central bank could stagger the process of raising euro zone interest rates by first lifting its sub-zero deposit rate back toward positive territory. The euro rose 0.4 percent to $1.2378 and left the dollar down across most major currencies aside from the Japanese yen. The yen, which traditionally rises in times of market stress, fell versus both the dollar and euro. The dollar rose to as high as 107.245 before giving up some of those gains. Safe haven bond prices including 10-year Treasuries initially dropped as risk appetite recovered. Gold rose 0.2 percent. The Australian dollar, which has fallen in recent weeks because of the economy’s exposure to global trade flows, gained against the dollar, as did Asian currencies including the Chinese yuan “Xi explicitly did not continue the trade war rhetoric so this is going to be risk-friendly and the market will be relieved,” said Kit Juckes, a macro strategist at Societe Generale. Russian financial markets sold off sharply. The rouble tumbled 4.2 percent, bringing its losses against the dollar since last Friday to around 10 percent. Rouble-denominated shares rose 0.8 percent, bouncing off multi-month lows hit on Monday when the Moscow bourse dropped 8.3 percent The shares of Rusal, the aluminium giant, which, with its boss Oleg Deripaska, was highlighted prominently in the sanctions, fell a further 7.5 percent in Hong Kong after slumping 50 percent on Monday. Its dollar bonds maturing 2022 were trading at record lows around 52 cents, having lost half their value since the sanctions were announced. “It is very serious, it’s very rare that you see a country literally force a company from another country towards bankruptcy. When you are shut out of dollar funding markets, a lot of your business will just stop working,” Saxo Bank’s Garnry said, adding that Russia’s smaller role in global financial markets would limit the wider fallout. The MSCI Emerging markets index was up 0.63 percent as other larger markets outside of Russia rallied.

Saudi Aramco holds a 62.5 percent stake in the refinery, while Total holds the other 37.5 percent. The memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed on the sidelines of a visit by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Paris. “The project will represent an investment of around $5 billion. The two partners are planning to start the front-end engineering and design in the third quarter of 2018,” Total said in a statement. Total added that 8,000 jobs would be created by the deal.

2018-04-10,"(Repeats item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell SINGAPORE, April 10 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco may have shot itself in the foot by unexpectedly increasing the price of its crude oil to Asia, with a major Chinese refiner responding by sharply cutting back on the volume of cargoes from the world’s top exporter. Sinopec, Asia’s largest refiner, aims to slash its crude oil imports from Saudi Arabia’s state producer by 40 percent in May, according to an official from the company’s trading arm Unipec. Such a large cut sends two very clear messages to Aramco, the first being that Sinopec didn’t agree with the price hike, and the second that the Chinese refiner feels it can make up any shortfall from other suppliers. It’s an almost unprecedented response by a significant buyer of Saudi crude, and it underlines the extent to which the market was caught by surprise by Aramco’s decision to increase the official selling prices (OSPs) for May-loading cargoes. And it’s not just Sinopec that is sending a message, with trading sources at two North Asian refiners saying they also plan to reduce volumes from Saudi Arabia by 10 percent in May. Aramco boosted the OSP for its benchmark Arab Light grade for Asian customers for May cargoes to a premium of $1.20 a barrel over the average of quotes for regional grades Oman and Dubai, up 10 cents from the prior month. The market had been expecting a cut of between 50 and 60 cents a barrel, based on movements in the price curve between front- and third-month cash Dubai prices. Unlike Brent and West Texas Intermediate, the two largest global crude benchmarks, the Dubai market is in contango, where prices for later-dated cargoes are higher than those for immediate delivery. This suggested to the market that Aramco would lower their OSP, as the company usually sets its OSPs in line with changes in the pricing structure for Dubai crude. Aramco doesn’t disclose reasons for changes in its pricing, leaving the market somewhat nonplussed at the action. The most plausible explanation for the deviation from previous practice is that Aramco is doing its best to keep oil prices high ahead of its planned initial public offering (IPO). The listing, which is slated for later this year but is probably more likely in 2019, needs a strong oil price to be successful, with a figure above $70 a barrel seen as a minimum. Brent crude is currently around $67 a barrel, meaning the Saudis have to continue to do everything possible to keep the price biased higher. Up to now the main vehicle for boosting prices has been the deal to cut output, struck by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allied producers, including Russia. The surprise increase in the OSP for its major customers in Asia may be another tactic aimed at keeping oil prices strong. But as the Sinopec reaction shows, Aramco may end up with the worst of possible outcomes. It’s likely to continue to surrender market share to rivals in China, and if Sinopec has no difficulty obtaining alternative supplies it undermines any narrative that oil markets are tight and prices should rise further. Saudi Arabia used to be China’s largest supplier of crude oil, but has lost that spot to Russia in the past two years. Chinese customs data showed imports from Saudi Arabia rose only 2.3 percent on 2017 from the previous year, below the overall increase of 10.2 percent. Imports from Russia jumped 13.8 percent, and those from third-ranked supplier Angola by 15.3 percent. Detailed figures for 2018 are only available for the first two months of the year, but these show China’s imports from Saudi Arabia down by 8.9 percent, while those from Russia surged 20.7 percent and those from Angola rose by 2.6 percent. If Angola continues to gain market share in China, it may well overtake Saudi Arabia to take second spot behind Russia this year, a possibility that surely should concern Aramco’s executives and their political masters. It appears as if the Saudis are increasingly putting themselves between a rock and a hard place. They need to keep the crude price high to boost the IPO, but face the loss of market share in Asia and potential damage to relations with long-term customers.

2018-04-10,"(Repeats to additional subscribers, adds pictures) ZURICH, April 10 (Reuters) - Nestle wants to make all of its packaging recyclable or reusable by 2025, the Swiss food giant said on Tuesday, becoming the latest food company to vow to reduce plastic waste. European governments have stepped up efforts to reduce plastic waste littering land and sea, and companies across the food supply chain are following suit. UK supermarket chain Waitrose pledged on Tuesday to ban disposable coffee cups from its shops by this autumn. “Plastic waste is one of the biggest sustainability issues the world is facing today. Tackling it requires a collective approach,” Nestle Chief Executive Mark Schneider said in a statement. The world’s biggest packaged food company said it would focus on eliminating non-recyclable plastics, encourage the use of plastics that allow better recycling rates and eliminate or change complex combinations of packaging materials. “We are working on changing the colours used for our plastic packaging. Lighter colours are easier to recycle,” Nestle sustainability expert Duncan Pollard told reporters on a call. Nestle rival Unilever said last week it had struck a partnership to pioneer a new technology which converts PET (polyethylene terephthalate) waste back into virgin-grade material for use in food packaging. The company already committed last year to making all of its plastic packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. Coffee chain Starbucks is doing its bit by offering customers a discount on their drink if they bring in their own tumbler or cup. The British government announced plans last month to introduce a deposit return scheme for single-use drink containers and EU regulators have said they want to increase recycling of plastic, after China banned imports of “foreign garbage” from the start of 2018.

2018-04-10,"(Adds context) By Ehab Farouk CAIRO, April 10 (Reuters) - Egypt plans to cut fuel subsidies by a quarter and nearly halve those for electricity in the financial year starting in July, but will raise food subsidies slightly, a government document said, in a move that would reduce budget costs by $2.4 billion. Cutting subsidies to reduce pressure on government spending is one of the country’s main goals as it pushes forward with reforms to revive an economy that has struggled since a 2011 uprising. It is also a condition of a $12 billion deal Egypt signed with the International Monetary Fund in 2016. Egypt aims to reduce subsidies on fuel to 89.075 billion Egyptian pounds ($5.05 billion) from 120.926 billion pounds in the 2018/19 fiscal year, according to the document. It will also reduce electricity subsidies by almost half, bringing them down to 16 billion Egyptian pounds from 30 billion pounds, the statement said. Last summer, Egypt raised fuel and electricity prices by 50 and 42 percent respectively, sending inflation shooting up. The country aims to increase food subsidies by 5 percent, to reach 86.175 billion pounds from 82.177 billion pounds, according to the same document. Egypt supports about 68.8 million citizens through 20.8 million subsidy cards that grant each citizen 50 pounds monthly to buy essential goods. The government submitted a 2018/19 budget draft to parliament last month and expects it to be ratified before the start of the new fiscal year. $1 = 17.6200 Egyptian pounds

2018-04-10,"PARIS (Reuters) - Problems with weldings at a nuclear reactor under construction in Flamanville are worse than first expected and may impact the cost and startup of the long-delayed project, French state-owned utility EDF (EDF.PA) said on Tuesday. When EDF first reported weldings problems on Feb. 22, it initially said there would be no impact on safety, costs or the reactor startup schedule. However, France’s ASN nuclear regulator warned on Feb. 28 that the substandard welding could well have an impact on Flamanville’s startup. Even before the welding problems emerged, ASN had warned several times the reactor’s construction schedule was tight. “Following the current checks and the licensing process by the ASN, EDF will be able to specify whether the project requires an adjustment to its timetable and its costs,” EDF said in a statement about the site in northern France. EDF shares fell as much as 2.2 percent in early trading, then recovered to stand one percent lower.  Any major further delay to Flamanville’s EPR reactor - the same type EDF is building in Hinkley Point in Britain - could add hundreds of millions of euros to the budget and negatively impact EDF earnings.  The Flamanville 3 reactor is expected to load nuclear fuel at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. Construction started in 2007 with a launch target of 2012.  After a string of delays, its cost was estimated at 10.5 billion euros ($12.9 billion) in 2015 - more than three times its original budget. Since then the cost has not been updated, despite the discovery of several additional major problems, notably weak spots in the steel of its containment vessel. On Feb. 22, EDF said 38 of 66 areas of welding on the reactor's secondary cooling circuit were not in line with standards aimed at making them rupture-proof, although it said they still met ASN requirements. reut.rs/2H6Km3B But on Tuesday EDF said additional controls of all 150 weldings on the circuit had shown that some were not in line with ASN requirements.  “Some weldings will have to be redone,” said Flamanville director Laurent Thieffry. EDF head of new nuclear Xavier Ursat said testing and review of the welding will be completed by the end of May, after which EDF will announce any impact on startup timing.  The secondary circuit consists of 360 metres of 50-75 cm diametre piping that conducts steam from the reactor’s four steam generators to the plant’s turbine, and pumps condensed water back to the steam generators.  Three-to-four centimetres thick, the pipes require high-tech welding that takes up to eight weeks in each case. Repairs could take up to a few weeks per welding.

Russian assets extended Monday’s slide as investors digested the new round of U.S. sanctions targeting the country’s tycoons. The Russian rouble plunged more than 4 percent against the dollar to its lowest since late-2016. Speaking at the Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan province, Xi vowed to open China’s economy, protect intellectual property of foreign firms and he criticized isolationism in his first public comments since the trade dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration erupted. Xi’s comments prompted a largely positive reaction in financial markets, which have been rattled over the past week on fears the tit-for-tat U.S.-China tariffs will explode into a full-scale trade war in a blow to global growth. European markets followed their Asian counterparts at the open with solid gains. Germany’s DAX rose almost 1 percent, France’s CAC 40 0.56 percent and Britain’s FTSE 100 0.46 percent. The U.S. S&P 500 E-mini futures gained 1.01 percent, suggesting U.S. shares would open positively later on Tuesday. The MSCI World Index rose 0.27 percent. “In the current environment markets are grabbing at the slightest hint. Today’s message from Xi contained nothing really new but it seemed like a conciliatory tone and so the market is just grabbing at that,” said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen. “It goes back to the fact that there is still uncertainty on trade wars and even if we get a slight indication that it won’t be the worst case scenario, the market reacts positively,” he said, while predicting ongoing trade tensions throughout 2018. Oil markets rose by more than 1 percent on hopes that the trade dispute between the world’s two-largest economies may be resolved without greater damage to the global economy. Brent crude futures climbed more 1.15 percent to $69.44. The Japanese yen, which traditionally rises in times of market stress, fell versus the dollar and euro. The dollar rose to as high as 107.245 before giving up some of those gains and trading up 0.2 percent at 107.03. Safe haven bond prices dropped as risk appetite recovered. U.S. 10-year Treasuries fell, pushing their yields up 1.5 basis points to 2.8027 percent before easing back. Gold rose 0.3 percent but later gave up those gains. The Australian dollar, which has fallen in recent weeks because of the Australian economy’s exposure to global trade flows, gained against the dollar and set a three-week high versus the yen. “Xi explicitly did not continue the trade war rhetoric so this is going to be risk friendly and the market will be relieved,” said Kit Juckes, a macro strategist at Societe Generale. Russian financial markets sold-off sharply. The rouble tumbled 4.2 percent, bringing its losses against the dollar since last Friday to around 10 percent. Rouble-denominated shares rose 0.8 percent, bouncing off multi-month lows hit on Monday when the Moscow bourse dropped 8.3 percent The shares of Rusal, the aluminium giant, which, with its boss Oleg Deripaska, was highlighted prominently in the sanctions, fell a further 7.5 percent in Hong Kong after slumping 50 percent on Monday.

2018-04-10,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s National Grid (NG.L) said on Tuesday it expects low demand for electricity this summer as small-scale renewables output increases and warned there could be times when there is more generation than needed.  In its summer outlook report, National Grid said peak transmission system demand for high summer (June-August) was forecast at 33.7 gigawatts (GW) and the summer minimum at 17 GW. “The increase in distribution connected generation, for example wind and solar photovoltaic, has contributed to this downward trend in demand,” the grid operator said in the report. Summer electricity demand from the grid has been falling over the past few years due in part to a rapid increase in the amount of solar power generation on people’s homes and factory roofs. However, increased renewables output can create challenges as solar and wind output is variable. “As a result, we may need to take more actions to curtail generation and possibly instruct inflexible generators to reduce their output in order to balance the system,” the report added. Lower overall electricity demand, along with increased renewables generation, means there is less need for gas-fired electricity generation. Total UK gas demand for this summer is forecast at 35.7 billion cubic meters, slightly lower than last summer. National Grid said it expects to see similar gas supply and demand patterns to last summer, with demand only around 30 percent lower than the winter peak.  However, National Grid said its expects one of the highest volumes of maintenance on the gas transmission system to date this summer. The grid operator also forecasts that there will be 1.8 bcm of gas demand for storage sites, compared to demand of 2.5 bcm last summer. The amount of gas which will be injected into gas storage sites this summer will depend on the level of stock at the end of winter. Gas is traditionally stored during the summer months to be used during winter when demand and prices are higher. However the closure of Britain’s largest gas storage site Rough means less gas can be stored. Last year, the most significant injection into storage was when the InterconnectorUK pipeline to continental Europe closed for annual maintenance during the summer. National Grid expects a similar trend this summer.

2018-04-10,"* Huaneng, Datang, Zhejiang working on index plan -Huaneng exec * Utilities have complained about wild volatility in prices * Index to cover 70 pct of China coal imports * Plan comes as utilities fret over falling imports (Updating with reaction, comment) By Meng Meng and Josephine Mason BEIJING, April 10 (Reuters) - China’s major utilities are preparing to launch their own coal price index for imports, an official at China Huaneng Group said, in a move the power firms hope will give them more control over how much they pay for their key raw material. Huaneng is working on the plan with China Datang Corp , Guangdong Yuedean Group and Zhejiang Energy, said Xu Zanfei, director of planning for Huaneng’s fuel department, in a presentation at the 16th Coaltrans China conference. The plan for an index also has the backing of smaller power companies, he said. Even as China’s government tries to cut the use of dirty fuels, coal still accounts for a majority of the country’s power. Utilities have complained over the past two years that a prolonged rally in prices to record highs - due to tighter supplies of the fuel and strong demand - has hurt profits. The plan also comes as utility executives say they are increasingly worried the government will expand efforts to curb imports, potentially fueling another rally and cutting their access to raw materials. Imports are expected to fall 8 percent this year. The new index - which Xu said will be launched “soon” - will cover 70 percent of China’s total coal intake and will offer prices for southern and eastern imports. The utilities hope the huge volumes involved in supplying major Chinese power producers will induce coal suppliers to use the index in their contracts. “We hope China can have some consistency (in its import policy). Imported coal is crucial for power plants in the coastal areas, especially in the summer when rail freight capacity is tight,” Xu said. Speaking on the conference sidelines after his presentation, Xu said the index will mainly reflect prices for material from Austrialia and Indonesia, which together accounted for almost two-thirds of China’s coal imports last year. Zhao Jianguo, the vice chairman of China’s Coal Transportation Association, said the index has a decent chance of being used as an industry benchmark because it has backing from major utilities. “This index is likely to be influential, because it will reflect prices purchased by power plants,” he said on the sidelines of the conference. This would be China’s first price index for coal imports. The Bohai-Rim Steam-Coal Price Index (BSPI) is a widely used spot price benchmark for domestic trade. Companies have different schemes for pricing their imports, but traders said having a coal price index may help make the market more transparent.

2018-04-10,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Armed groups in Libya are killing and torturing detainees in prisons, some nominally under government control, where thousands of civilians are being unlawfully held, the United Nations said on Tuesday. Successive governments in Tripoli have allowed the armed groups to arrest opponents, activists, journalists and politicians, while paying the fighters salaries and providing them with equipment and uniforms, it said. “As a result, armed groups’ power has grown unchecked and they have remained free of effective government oversight,” the U.N. human rights office and UNSMIL (U.N. Support Mission in Libya) said in a report. “Men, women and children across Libya are arbitrarily detained or unlawfully deprived of their liberty based on their tribal or family links and perceived political affiliations.” U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein denounced “appalling abuses” and “the sheer horror”. Zeid urged authorities to release people held in custody without cause and to prosecute crimes including torture, kidnapping and executions as a step towards re-establishing the rule of law. The report said many detainees have been held without charge or trial since the 2011 revolution that overthrew former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. Disputed elections in 2014 resulted in Libya being split between competing political and military factions in the west and east of the country. Political turmoil and sporadic armed conflict have led to economic collapse, giving space to militant groups, including Islamist insurgents. “Torture and ill-treatment are systematic in detention facilities across Libya, particularly in the initial period of detention and during interrogations,” the U.N. said. Methods include beatings with metal bars, flogging, and electronic shocks, it said in the report based on interviews, prison visits, legal and forensic records, and photographic and video evidence. Official prisons overseen by the justice ministry hold an estimated 6,500 inmates and thousands more are in facilities nominally under government control but run by armed groups, the report said.  The detention facility at Mitiga airbase in Tripoli is run by the Special Deterence Force (SDF) armed group, allied to the Government of National Accord, and is probably the largest in western Libya with 2,600 detainees.  “Detainees are subjected to torture, unlawful killing, denial of adequate medical treatment and poor detention conditions,” the U.N. said. At least 37 bodies bearing signs of torture were brought to Tripoli hospitals last year, according to the report. In the east, about 1,800 detainees are held at Kuweifiya prison, where the U.N. documented torture and inhumane conditions, including in a section run by the Libyan National Army, a coalition led by Khalifa Haftar. Bodies of people taken by armed groups have been found on the streets and in rubbish dumps of Benghazi, many with bound limbs, marks of torture and gunshot wounds, it said.

2018-04-10,"FRANKFURT/MILAN (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency miners are moving in to Norway and Sweden to take advantage of cheap hydro-electric energy and low temperatures to power and cool their servers. Iceland has been Europe’s most popular location for miners of digital currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum. But at 6.5 euro cents and 7.1 cents per kilowatt hours, respectively, commercial power prices in Sweden and Norway are cheaper than Iceland’s 8 cents and far below the European average of 11 cents. The interest is good news for Sweden’s Vattenfall [VATN.UL] and Norway’s Statkraft [STATKF.UL], the dominant utilities in their countries.  Supplying power to cryptocurrency miners is a tiny part of current business but the two state-owned firms have said they see it as an opportunity. The process is energy intensive. Miners plug in thousands of servers at a time to get the computing power to produce cryptocurrencies, which is done by solving mathematical equations. Miners of bitcoin will use about 130 terawatt hours of energy this year, matching Argentina’s consumption or the projected usage of all the world’s electric vehicles by the mid-2020s, according to Morgan Stanley. “We’re on a global hunt to secure as much power as we can,” said Olivier Roussy Newton, director and co-founder of Canadian group HIVE Blockchain Technologies (HIVE.V), which started mining ethereum in Sweden in January. The company said it was expanding energy capacity for its crypto mining in Sweden to 17.4 megawatts, with funds available to ramp up a further 26.8 MW by September. Last month, it agreed to buy data centre company Kolos Norway AS for $9.9 million (7.00 million pounds) with a view to expanding its mining operations. In March, U.S. miner Bitfury opened a new $35 million mining data centre in Norway. The miner will be buying 350 gigawatt hours of pure clean energy from local renewable energy provider Helgeland Kraft [HKRAT.UL]. Many bitcoin miners are looking at the area including the Chinese because of abundant cheap hydro power, said Bill Tai, a member of Bitfury’s board of directors. China’s Bitmain, the world’s largest bitcoin miner which recently set up a unit in Switzerland, has also been investigating Sweden and Norway’s potential, two industry sources with knowledge of the matter said. China accounts for around 70 percent of the crytopcurrency mining industry but Beijing has discouraged it in part, due to concerns about pollution from coal-fired power. This has forced them to look elsewhere. “A lot of miners are keen to get into Norway and that includes Bitmain and other Chinese names,” said Mark Collins, chief executive of CBH Consulting AG, a Zurich-based clean energy consultant running for the blockchain industry. A second source with knowledge of the matter also mentioned Bitmain’s interest. “A number of nationalities are turning to the Nordics,” that source said. Bitmain spokesman Nishant Sharma said the company would announce expansions in Europe and other regions as they occur. He said he was not aware of any “special plans” for Sweden or Norway. Mining a single bitcoin requires $1,400-$1,800 worth of electricity, up to a quarter of the total costs and about the annual power bill of a four-person household in Germany. This means that cryptocurrency miners are under pressure from policymakers to prove their green credentials and Norway and Sweden’s clean energy holds even greater appeal. “This area is the Saudi Arabia of green energy,” said Tai. In Norway, hydropower accounts for over 99 percent of electricity production while in Sweden the number is about 40 percent with the same again from nuclear. Some utilities in Europe such as Italy’s Enel (ENEI.MI) and Germany’s E.ON (EONGn.DE) are worried that the speculation behind cryptocurrencies could lead to a market crash. Enel said in February it was not interested in powering cryptocurrency miners. But Norway and Sweden have welcomed the business. “It is an opportunity for energy providers in the area. It’s a consistent power draw for them without spikes and troughs and energy providers like that,” said Collins. Norway recently changed tax rules to exempt data centres from paying property taxes in a bid to attract foreign companies. Node Pole, a Swedish investment advisor owned by Vattenfall and smaller peer Skelleftea Kraft, helped Chinese tech company Canaan Creative, a miner and one of the world’s largest makers of bitcoin mining chips, to set up shop in Sweden last year. “For the last 6-8 months there has been an increasing interest in opportunities in Sweden,” Node Pole Chief Executive Patrik Oehlund said. Vattenfall provides Canaan with the roughly 10 MW of power capacity it needs and the utility sees more bitcoin deals on the horizon.    “There are a number of companies in different phases of evaluating establishment on the Nordic Market,” said Matts Wesslen, Vattenfall’s manager of energy intensive industries. Nevertheless, Alex de Vries, blockchain specialist at PwC, said the opportunities in cryptocurrency mining may be short-lived. “If bitcoin energy consumption continues like it does today it will become unsustainable,” he said. “That might be an opportunity for utilities in the short-term but over the long-term miners will have to find ways to become more efficient to cut electricity use.” (For a graphic on Bitcoin's energy consumption, click tmsnrt.rs/2H6FpYz) Additional reporting by Patricia Uhlig in Frankfurt and Lefteris Karagiannopoulos in Oslo; editing by Anna Willard",https://uk.reuters.com/article/crypto-currencies-nordics-energy/cryptocurrency-miners-seek-cheap-energy-in-norway-and-sweden-idUKL8N1RM31G,10 Apr 2018,"Cryptocurrency miners

2018-04-10,"BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China’s Sinochem Group has hired seven banks to manage a $2 billion Hong Kong stock listing of its key oil assets, three people said, as the state-owned firm shifts to higher-value businesses, including petrochemicals production. Sinochem has chosen BOC International, CLSA and Morgan Stanley as joint sponsors of the initial public offering (IPO), the people, who have direct knowledge of the matter, said. It has also picked China International Capital Corp (CICC), HSBC, ICBC International and JPMorgan to work on the IPO, which is expected in the second half of this year, said the people. The planned IPO will likely include Sinochem’s oil refining, oil trading, storage and logistics, as well as distribution and retail businesses, but not its struggling upstream business - mostly overseas oil and gas production. The proposed float comes amid a push by Beijing to inject new life into bloated state-owned enterprises by encouraging private capital investment in the enterprises. China’s government has been moving to create bigger, stronger state firms, and build globally competitive enterprises. It is also weeding out excess capacity in bloated sectors, but wants to avoid any risk of mass layoffs or a blow to economic growth. JPMorgan and CLSA declined to comment. Sinochem and all the other investment banks did not respond to a request for comment. The people declined to be named as the deal details are not public yet. Sinochem’s IPO plans have been pushed ahead by chairman Frank Ning, who joined the firm in early 2016 from food group COFCO, where he was well known for aggressive restructuring and M&A, Reuters reported in October. Under his leadership, several Sinochem units have been given more leeway in their expansion plans and more support for tapping capital markets for fundraising. Hit by low oil prices, Beijing-based Sinochem has aimed to shift from oil exploration and production to the more value-added refining and retailing businesses. It has been looking to sell a stake in Brazil’s Peregrino offshore oilfield.  The oil and chemicals group is also looking to leverage technology, according to one company official. “Otherwise the business is too traditional,” said the official. Sinochem Energy Technology Co Ltd, a newly established unit with more than 300 staff, has so far invested more than 100 million yuan ($15.88 million) in technology, according to a separate company official.  Sinochem controls the 240,000 barrel-per-day Quanzhou refinery in the coastal province of Fujian, a major source of group profits in the past two years. Sinochem has said it wants to boost investment at the refinery to diversify into petrochemicals. It also runs nearly 10 crude and oil products terminals, and more than 700 retail stations across China, its website showed. The group’s annual turnover of crude and products is about 150 million tonnes, while the combined annual capacity of its three refineries is nearly 25 million tonnes.

2018-04-10,"TOKYO (Reuters) - An influential Japanese energy panel on Tuesday left the door open to building nuclear plants to help meet long-term emissions targets, urging rapid technology improvements to allow industry to develop safer and more economic reactors. The advisory panel, whose recommendations will feed into a review of the country’s 2030 basic energy plan and its measures to cut carbon emissions by 2050, said Japan should reduce its dependence on nuclear power, shift from coal to gas and boost renewable energy. However, it listed nuclear power as an option for decarbonization in 2050, implying the possibility of new reactors, which is not part of the current policy of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. “The report does not specifically talk about possible building of new reactors or replacing existing reactors, but it does not deny such a possibility either,” Shogo Tanaka, director of the ministry’s energy strategy office told reporters. Nuclear faces strong public opposition in the wake of the deadly 2011 Fukushima disaster, with just five of the country’s 39 commercially viable reactors currently operating. The closures have boosted Japan’s reliance on coal and natural gas and it is currently the world’s fifth-biggest carbon emitter. The country has pledged to trim its emissions from 2013 levels by 26 percent by 2030 and by 80 percent by 2050. It is currently aiming for a 2030 electricity mix of 22-24 percent renewables, 20-22 percent nuclear and 56 percent fossil fuels including 27 percent gas and 26 percent coal. In the fiscal year to March 2017, fossil fuels accounted for 83 percent of Japan’s electricity, renewables 15 percent and nuclear just 2 percent. The advisory panel, made up of industry and academic representatives and including Hitachi Ltd Chairman Hiroaki Nakanishi, did not give a proposed energy mix for future years. It called for a further boost in renewable energy to make the sector a key and economically independent power source by 2050, citing accelerating development in hydrogen and energy storage technology.  While urging a shift away from coal, it also recommended the continued development and export of high-efficient coal power technology to help curb emissions overseas.

2018-04-10,"* Asian shares and U.S. stock futures rally * Xi’s remarks soothe worries about China-U.S. trade spat * U.S. Treasuries slip; safe haven yen falls (Updates prices, adds European shares seen opening higher) By Masayuki Kitano SINGAPORE, April 10 (Reuters) - U.S stock futures rallied, Asian equities bounced and the safe haven yen fell on Tuesday, as Chinese President Xi Jinping promised to lower import tariffs on products including cars,  helping soothe investor jitters over an escalating U.S.-China trade row. Xi, speaking at the Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan province, said that China will take measures to sharply widen market access for foreign investors, raise the foreign ownership limit in the automobile sector and protect intellectual property of foreign firms. Xi’s comments prompted a rapid and largely positive reaction in financial markets, which have been rattled over the past week on fears the tit-for-tat U.S.-China tariffs will explode into a full-scale trade war in a blow to global growth. “His comments seem to have covered all the major issues the U.S. has raised, including intellectual property and liberalisation of domestic markets,” said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist for JPMorgan Asset Management in Tokyo. “Xi threw the ball into the U.S. court but it appears China is laying the groundwork to achieve an agreement with the U.S.” In the stock market, U.S. S&P 500 E-mini futures rose 1.2 percent, while China’s Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.5 percent. Financial spreadbetters expect London’s FTSE to open 46 points up at 7,240, Frankfurt’s DAX to open 109 points higher at 12,371 and Paris’ CAC to open 47 points firmer at 5,311. The MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan recovered from early losses and advanced 0.8 percent. “By and large it appears that the speech is more conciliatory than it is pugilistic with respect to how their approach to the U.S. is,” said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy for Mizuho Bank in Singapore. “At the end of the day the sense is that the political incentives will be for both parties to get to the negotiation table.” Japan’s Nikkei share average rose 0.8 percent, helped by a jump in the transportation sector. Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co, which have operations in China, rallied 2 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Hopes that the trade dispute between the world’s two-largest economies may be resolved without greater damage to the global economy gave a lift to oil markets, with Brent crude futures rising 0.5 percent. As risk sentiment improved, the safe haven currencies and assets retreated. U.S. 10-year Treasuries fell, pushing their yields up 2 basis points to 2.806 percent. Gold eased 0.3 percent. The safe-haven yen fell broadly, helping the dollar rise 0.3 percent to 107.16 yen. The Australian dollar set a three-week high at 82.94 yen. Against the U.S. dollar, the Australian dollar gained 0.4 percent to $0.7730. China is Australia’s top export market and the Aussie is often used as a liquid proxy by investors expressing views on the country’s outlook. “President Xi has ignited a rally in risk assets that might have some legs if the U.S. can keep a lid on the protectionist rhetoric for a while,” said Sean Callow, FX strategist for Westpac in Sydney.

2018-04-10,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell SINGAPORE, April 10 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco may have shot itself in the foot by unexpectedly increasing the price of its crude oil to Asia, with a major Chinese refiner responding by sharply cutting back on the volume of cargoes from the world’s top exporter. Sinopec, Asia’s largest refiner, aims to slash its crude oil imports from Saudi Arabia’s state producer by 40 percent in May, according to an official from the company’s trading arm Unipec. Such a large cut sends two very clear messages to Aramco, the first being that Sinopec didn’t agree with the price hike, and the second that the Chinese refiner feels it can make up any shortfall from other suppliers. It’s an almost unprecedented response by a significant buyer of Saudi crude, and it underlines the extent to which the market was caught by surprise by Aramco’s decision to increase the official selling prices (OSPs) for May-loading cargoes. And it’s not just Sinopec that is sending a message, with trading sources at two North Asian refiners saying they also plan to reduce volumes from Saudi Arabia by 10 percent in May. Aramco boosted the OSP for its benchmark Arab Light grade for Asian customers for May cargoes to a premium of $1.20 a barrel over the average of quotes for regional grades Oman and Dubai, up 10 cents from the prior month. The market had been expecting a cut of between 50 and 60 cents a barrel, based on movements in the price curve between front- and third-month cash Dubai prices. Unlike Brent and West Texas Intermediate, the two largest global crude benchmarks, the Dubai market is in contango, where prices for later-dated cargoes are higher than those for immediate delivery. This suggested to the market that Aramco would lower their OSP, as the company usually sets its OSPs in line with changes in the pricing structure for Dubai crude. Aramco doesn’t disclose reasons for changes in its pricing, leaving the market somewhat nonplussed at the action. The most plausible explanation for the deviation from previous practice is that Aramco is doing its best to keep oil prices high ahead of its planned initial public offering (IPO). The listing, which is slated for later this year but is probably more likely in 2019, needs a strong oil price to be successful, with a figure above $70 a barrel seen as a minimum. Brent crude is currently around $67 a barrel, meaning the Saudis have to continue to do everything possible to keep the price biased higher. Up to now the main vehicle for boosting prices has been the deal to cut output, struck by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allied producers, including Russia. The surprise increase in the OSP for its major customers in Asia may be another tactic aimed at keeping oil prices strong. But as the Sinopec reaction shows, Aramco may end up with the worst of possible outcomes. It’s likely to continue to surrender market share to rivals in China, and if Sinopec has no difficulty obtaining alternative supplies it undermines any narrative that oil markets are tight and prices should rise further. Saudi Arabia used to be China’s largest supplier of crude oil, but has lost that spot to Russia in the past two years. Chinese customs data showed imports from Saudi Arabia rose only 2.3 percent on 2017 from the previous year, below the overall increase of 10.2 percent. Imports from Russia jumped 13.8 percent, and those from third-ranked supplier Angola by 15.3 percent. Detailed figures for 2018 are only available for the first two months of the year, but these show China’s imports from Saudi Arabia down by 8.9 percent, while those from Russia surged 20.7 percent and those from Angola rose by 2.6 percent. If Angola continues to gain market share in China, it may well overtake Saudi Arabia to take second spot behind Russia this year, a possibility that surely should concern Aramco’s executives and their political masters. It appears as if the Saudis are increasingly putting themselves between a rock and a hard place. They need to keep the crude price high to boost the IPO, but face the loss of market share in Asia and potential damage to relations with long-term customers.

2018-04-10,"SINGAPORE, April 10 (Reuters) - Asian shares edged lower on Tuesday as Wall Street retreated from its highs after the FBI raided the offices of U.S. President Donald Trump’s long time lawyer, dampening risk appetite already under strain from an escalating U.S.-China trade spat. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.2 percent. South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.8 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei shed 0.4 percent. The sharp pull-back on Wall Street late in Monday’s trading seems to be dampening market sentiment, said Hirofumi Suzuki, an economist for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore. “U.S. equities rapidly lost momentum and so sentiment wasn’t that positive in the end,” Suzuki said. News that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had raided the offices and home of Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen on Monday had put a dampener on equities, which had rallied on signs of cooling in the China-U.S. trade spat. Cohen has been at the centre of a controversy surrounding payment to a porn star who has alleged that she had sex once in 2006 with Trump and was paid money shortly before the 2016 election to keep quiet about it. On Wall Street on Monday, the S&P 500 stock index gave up intraday gains as much as 1.9 percent to end up 0.3 percent. Markets are keenly awaiting a speech by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Boao Forum on Tuesday, which could elicit Xi’s first reaction on the tariff standoff with the United States. Financial markets have been buffeted over the past week or so amid the tit-for-tat tariff threats between the world’s two biggest economies. On Monday, China stepped up its attacks Washington over billions of dollars worth of threatened tariffs, but Trump again voiced optimism the two sides would hammer out a trade deal. Global equities managed to rally overnight on hopes the two sides will cool tensions and avert a full-scale trade row, with oil prices up more than 2 percent overnight for their biggest daily percentage gain since March 21. Brent crude futures rose $1.54 to settle at $68.65 a barrel. Russian stock indexes and the rouble both fell sharply on Monday after the United States hit Russian companies and officials with new financial sanctions to punish Moscow for a range of activities, including alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. The dollar-denominated RTS stock market index slid 11.4 percent, its largest single-day drop since December 2014, while the rouble slid more than 4 percent against the dollar, the biggest loss since January 2015. The U.S. dollar nursed its losses after slipping against a basket of six major currencies on Monday, hampered by persistent worries about the U.S.-China trade conflict. The dollar index held steady at 89.805, after shedding 0.3 percent on Monday. The euro inched up 0.1 percent to $1.2327, clinging to the gains made on Monday when it rose 0.3 percent as comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi were seen as supportive for the common currency. A slide in stock markets this year has not materially impacted euro zone financial conditions, Draghi said on Monday, suggesting that policymakers remain calm about the recent market volatility.

2018-04-10,"(Repeats April 9 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2GPRVs8 By John Kemp LONDON, April 9 (Reuters) - Hedge funds trimmed their bullish position in crude oil and fuels in the most recent week after increasing it significantly over the previous fortnight. But the overall reduction conceals a sharp shift away from U.S. light crude (WTI) and towards the international marker Brent, according to an analysis of position data published by regulators and exchanges. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum by 43 million barrels in the week to April 3. Portfolio managers cut their net long position in WTI (NYMEX and ICE) by 48 million barrels while trimming their net long in Brent by just 4 million barrels (tmsnrt.rs/2GPRVs8). The fall in WTI net length was the largest one-week reduction since the end of August, when hurricanes disrupted the U.S. refining system, and continues a trend evident in recent weeks. Funds have been steadily cutting their exposure to WTI over the last two months while maintaining a strong bullish position in Brent. The net long position in WTI has fallen by 105 million barrels since it peaked on Jan. 23 even as the net position in Brent has risen by an extra 27 million barrels over the same period. The result is that the position in Brent now looks exceptionally stretched while positioning in WTI looks far less lopsided. Fund managers now hold almost 21 long positions in Brent for every short position, a record imbalance, up from a ratio of 11:1 on Jan. 23. By contrast, funds hold fewer than nine long positions in WTI for every short, down from a ratio of almost 12:1 in late January. The shift in relative positioning between WTI and Brent mirrors the changing calendar spreads at the front end of the futures curve. The front-month calendar spread in WTI has gradually eased from backwardation towards contango since the start of February. Crude stocks have been increasing around the WTI delivery point at Cushing and there are reports of spreading pipeline bottlenecks throughout the West Texas/Permian region. By contrast, Brent calendar spreads have remained firmly in backwardation, and recently tightened again after softening during much of the last three months. Hedge funds are being drawn from WTI towards Brent in the search for roll yield (long positions have a positive yield in a backwardated market but cost money to maintain in a contango market). With oil prices having been basically flat since December, roll yield is becoming increasingly important to portfolio managers.

2018-04-10,"* Oil prices generally supported by OPEC-led supply restraint * Soaring U.S. output undermines OPEC efforts to prop up prices * China seeks alternative to Saudi supplies By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, April 10 (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Tuesday, easing after strong gains in the previous session when hopes that trade disputes between the United States and China could be resolved buoyed global markets. Despite a softening of trade concerns, oil markets still face an abundance of supplies that puts pressure on producers to keep their prices competitive in order not to lose market share. U.S. WTI crude futures were at $63.26 a barrel at 0031 GMT, down 16 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their previous settlement. Brent crude futures were at $68.52 per barrel, down 13 cents, or 0.2 percent. The dips came after a more than 2 percent rally on Monday during European and American trade hours. “Oil prices rose sharply (on Monday) as a weaker U.S.-dollar and easing concerns about the trade war saw investor appetite return,” ANZ bank said. “Reports that back-channel talks over the trade dispute between the U.S. and China are ongoing helped soothe investor angst,” it added. Concerns of a prolonged trade dispute between the world’s two biggest economies and uncertainty over the supply and demand balance of global oil markets have resulted in volatile yet range-bound recent trading. “Oil prices remain rangebound with WTI oil right in the middle of the $60-$65 per barrel range that has largely held since January of this year,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities. “U.S. oil inventories had been rising for the past couple of months but the data released last week showed an unexpected draw. This week’s data may be crucial for determining the direction of WTI,” he added. The American Petroleum Institute is due to publish oil storage data later on Tuesday while official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) is due on Wednesday. Oil markets have generally been supported by healthy demand as well as supply restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). However, soaring U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has jumped by a quarter since mid-2016 to 10.46 million barrels per day (bpd), is threatening to undermine OPEC’s efforts to tighten the market and prop up prices. The United States late last year overtook top exporter Saudi Arabia as the world’s second biggest crude producer. Only Russia pumps more crude out of the ground, at almost 11 million bpd. In a sign that oil supplies remain ample, China’s Sinopec , Asia’s largest refiner, plans to cut Saudi crude imports in May by 40 percent, instead buying from alternative sources, after Saudi Aramco set higher-than-expected prices, a company official said on Monday.

2018-04-10,"SHANGHAI, April 10 (Reuters) - China and Mongolia should begin research into a free trade agreement and speed up the launch of a cross-border cooperation zone in a bid to make use of the two countries complimentary advantages, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Monday. According to the official Xinhua news agency, Li told Mongolian Prime Minister Ukhnaa Khurelsukh in Beijing the two sides should work together more in industry, agriculture and animal husbandry, energy and minerals, transportation, pollution control and infrastructure construction. Landlocked Mongolia sells the bulk of its exports to China, its southern neighbour, and it has also been trying to make greater use of China’s transport network as well as its commodities exchanges in order to gain access to foreign markets. Mongolia aims to become a “transit corridor” to facilitate trade, as well as oil and gas deliveries, between Russia and China, and has sought funding for transportation projects from the China-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. But some nationalist politicians in Mongolia remain suspicious of Beijing’s intentions, and have expressed concern that China’s growing economic might could further enhance its political dominance in the region.

2018-04-10,"OSLO (Reuters) - Aluminium producer Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) denied on Monday its Alunorte alumina refinery in Brazil had contaminated local waters, contradicting the findings of a Brazilian public health group. Citing an internal study and a report commissioned from green consultancy SGW Services, Hydro said no evidence was found of overflow from its bauxite deposits or of any significant or lasting environmental impact. The company has previously admitted making some unregulated spills of untreated water, which it said was “completely unacceptable.” Hydro reiterated on Monday it would improve the plant’s water treatment. “Both reports confirm our previous statements that there was no overflow from the bauxite residue deposit areas, as well as no indication or evidence of contamination to nearby local communities from Alunorte as a result of the heavy rainfall in February,” Hydro CEO Svein Richard Brandtzaeg said in a statement. The public prosecutors’ office in the northern Brazilian state of Para where Alunorte is located said in a statement that scientific evidence shows the serious impact of regular discharges from the plant, disputing Hydro’s account. “Any attempt to conceal this fact is a violent attack on the rights of families who have had their health and livelihoods seriously undermined,” it said. Alunorte is currently running at about 50 percent capacity under a judicial order. The firm believes the two environmental reports will help the company win permission to resume full output from the plant, Brandtzaeg told Reuters. “This puts the facts on the table and gives us a foundation for resolving the situation,” he said, adding the firm was in “a constructive dialogue” with local authorities. Alunorte is the world’s largest alumina refinery with around 2,000 employees and a production capacity of 6.3 million tonnes, transforming bauxite to alumina, which is turned into aluminium at smelters. Hydro shares close up 6.62 percent, outperforming a flat Oslo benchmark index .OSEBX and extending gains from before the firm’s statement was published. They were benefiting from sanctions imposed on rival Rusal of Russia, traders said.  On April 6, Alunorte sued prosecutors in the Brazilian state of Para, asking a court to reject findings from the government-backed Evandro Chagas Institute, a public health research organisation. Marcelo Lima, a researcher at the institute, in an interview on Monday repeated that its analysis was scientifically rigorous and in line with international standards. In late February, Brazilian authorities ordered Hydro to temporarily halve its output from the plant.

2018-04-10,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - California’s top clean air regulator told Reuters on Monday the state is willing to give automakers more flexibility to comply with vehicle greenhouse-gas emissions rules even as her agency prepares to fight the Trump administration over car and truck pollution standards. Mary Nichols, who chairs the California Air Resources Board, said in an interview she thinks the Trump administration, California and automakers can reach agreement to revise and extend the standards. “We think there’s a way you could give some recognition to the concerns of the auto companies have raised that would not do fundamental damage to those standards,” Nichols said, suggesting the state could endorse new “credits and flexibilities” or “tweaks.” She said the state’s “precondition” for discussing changing the rules is that “you also need to talk to us about the next set of rules” extending to at least 2030. Last week, Scott Pruitt, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the standards on model year 2022 to 2025 vehicles were not appropriate and should be revised, reversing a decision by the Obama administration in January 2017 that had sought to lock in the rules. Nichols said California and other states are “actively examining” a lawsuit challenging Pruitt’s decision on the appropriateness of the 2025 rules before the administration proposes specific changes to the requirements. A legal filing seeking to preserve states’ rights is under consideration but does not mean they could not still try to reach agreement with automakers and the federal government.  “We can sue and talk at the same time,”  Nichols said. The Obama standards, agreed to by California and major automakers, called for roughly doubling by 2025 the average fuel efficiency of new vehicles sold in the United States to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025. Proponents said they could help spur innovation in clean technologies. Auto industry executives asked the Trump administration to revise the Obama standards to make it less costly to meet complex emissions and fuel economy targets, which vary depending on the size of vehicles and whether they are classified as cars or trucks. Nichols said federal and state governments and automakers should work on setting rules through 2030 and suggested California is open to a significant overhaul of the way the emissions rules work. She rejected the idea that there is a “crisis” facing automakers in meeting existing emissions rules. She said current federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy  standards do “not effectively incentivize” electric vehicles or other advanced vehicles. Those standards, commonly known as CAFE, were set in 1975 in response to the Arab oil embargos. Nichols said the state could agree to new credits to account for zero emission ride sharing vehicles or revise earlier rules that held automakers accountable for “upstream” emissions from the generation of power for electric vehicles. California has long been allowed by an EPA waiver to impose stricter standards than Washington does on vehicle emissions of some pollutants, but the state agreed to adopt the Obama emissions rules in 2011. And 12 other states, including New York, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, follow California’s lead on cleaner cars. The Trump administration has not shared any data with California yet, and there have been no substantial talks with the state and federal regulators, Nichols said. A primary concern among automakers is to avoid overlapping, conflicting regulatory standards. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sets Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, requirements that are not identical to the EPA limits on vehicle carbon dioxide emissions.  Automakers “agree and we do too that the CAFE standards have somewhat outlived their usefulness,” Nichols said. Auto regulations should be focused on overall vehicle emissions as “the driving factor,” she said.

2018-04-10,"MONTREAL/BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Canadian government on Monday said it was considering all its options on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, including a possible investment of public funds to ensure construction goes ahead, after Kinder Morgan Canada halted most work on the project and set a May 31 deadline to scrap the plan. Canada’s Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr, when asked whether the federal government would invest in the C$7.4 billion ($5.8 billion) project, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation: “We are looking at all options — that’s on the table. We’re not ruling anything out. We are doing an assessment of what might be necessary, working with the government of Alberta.” Carr’s comments follow Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s pledge on Sunday that the oil-rich province was prepared to invest in the pipeline to ensure the project moves ahead. Kinder Morgan Canada said on Sunday that it would scrap plans to nearly triple the capacity of its existing Trans Mountain pipeline, which extends from Alberta to British Columbia’s coast, unless various legal and jurisdictional challenges could be resolved by May 31. The project was approved by the federal government in 2016, but that approval is being challenged in court by First Nation groups and local municipalities, and British Columbia is eyeing whether it has jurisdiction to block increased oil shipments through its territory. To go ahead, the company needs more certainty, said Kinder Morgan’s Chief Executive Steve Kean in a conference call on Monday, which could mean “some kind of preemptive action” to make clear Canada’s jurisdiction over the project.  If the project is ultimately canceled, then the company would evaluate any write-off in the second quarter, he added.     Shares of Kinder Morgan Canada, spun off by its U.S. parent to raise funds for the project a year ago, fell as much as 19 percent to their lowest since its listing. The shares pared some losses but still ended down 12.58 percent at C$16.12.   The 1,147-kilometer (712 mile) pipeline is considered crucial to Canadian oil producers, who are desperate to access new overseas markets. Canada sends the majority of its energy products to the United States.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, when asked by reporters on Monday in Montreal, reiterated that the pipeline would be built. For a story on the Canada’s options: On Monday, Notley said she was still very hopeful a solution could be found, citing the risks of an imminent constitutional crisis. Craig Wright, chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said that not increasing pipeline capacity had the potential to knock C$10 billion ($7.9 billion) off wealth generation in Canada annually by adding to a sustained discount for the country’s crude oil. Canadian crude trades at a discount to the U.S. oil benchmark, with tight pipeline and rail capacity sending the Western Canadian Select differential sharply wider than normal earlier this year. It was trading at $16.25 on Monday, according to Shorcan Energy brokers. The pipeline dispute spurred business lobby groups to ask the federal government to clear up the uncertainty. “The Trans Mountain Expansion is in the national interest and if it fails to move forward, it will send a strong negative signal to investors at home and abroad that we, as a country, are not open for business,” said Perrin Beatty, President and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.
