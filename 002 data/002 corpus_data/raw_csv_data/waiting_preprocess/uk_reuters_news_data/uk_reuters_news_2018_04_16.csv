2018-04-16,"(Recasts, adds legislation detail, comments from politicians and First Nation elder) By Julie Gordon and Nicole Mordant VANCOUVER, April 16 (Reuters) - Canada’s Alberta province on Monday edged closer to cutting off fuel shipments to neighboring British Columbia in an escalation of a row over the stalled C$7.4 billion ($5.9 billion) expansion of the Kinder Morgan Canada Trans Mountain pipeline. The project has pitted Ottawa and Alberta against British Columbia (B.C.), and could turn into a constitutional crisis, derail Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s energy strategy and dent business confidence. Kinder Morgan said earlier this month it was halting most work on the Trans Mountain expansion project, which was approved by Canada in 2016 but has been beset by legal tussles. The expansion of the pipeline, which extends from Alberta to the B.C. coast, is desperately needed by oil-rich Alberta, which wants to export more of the crude it produces. But it is vehemently opposed by B.C., which has pledged new environmental rules and a legal challenge, putting construction at risk. Seeking to put pressure on its neighbor, Alberta introduced legislation on Monday that gives it the power to control what products flow through export pipelines, allowing it to prioritize more valuable crude oil shipments over refined fuels, like gasoline. That could hurt B.C., which uses Alberta’s refined fuel. Trans Mountain is the only pipeline in North America that carries both crude and refined fuel products. “We did not start this fight, but let there be no doubt we will do whatever it takes to build this pipeline,” Alberta Premier Rachel Notley told reporters. B.C. environment minister George Heyman said in response that his government was “prepared to defend British Columbians’ interests with every legal means available.” On Sunday, Trudeau pledged financial aid and said his government would draft legislation to reaffirm federal jurisdiction over the issue. Those measures have the aim “of making sure that one, that this pipeline will be built and two, that all of the investors involved know that we take this seriously and they can be confident it will go through,” said a source close to the government on Monday. Kinder Morgan Canada’s shares closed up 13 Canadian cents at C$17.37 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Under the new legislation, Alberta can ask companies exporting energy products to seek a license, allowing the government to impose restrictions on transport by pipeline, rail and truck. The province will only enforce the new rules if deemed necessary and any move may be tied to the outcome of a planned May 31 decision by Kinder Morgan on whether construction will go ahead, Notley said. Aboriginal and municipal leaders held a news conference in the B.C. port city of Vancouver to reiterate their opposition to the project, which they say poses a grave environmental risk. “They can call in the Canadian army, ok, I’ll stand in front,” said Amy George, a First Nation elder. “I’m going to stand up for my grandchildren, for my waters, for my land and for my air.” $1 = 1.2576 Canadian dollars

2018-04-16,"WASHINGTON, April 16 (Reuters) - U.S. government watchdogs rapped two members of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet on Monday over their spending last year, adding pressure on an administration already roiled by ethics complaints. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) said the Environmental Protection Agency violated the law when it approved a $43,000 soundproof phone booth last year for Administrator Scott Pruitt without seeking approval from lawmakers. And the Department of Interior’s Office of Inspector General said Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke took an unnecessary charter flight in June after a speech he made there to a professional hockey team that cost taxpayers more than $12,000. The new reports come as the White House seeks to shake off persistent criticism by lawmakers of ethical lapses and wasteful spending by Trump’s senior officials - something that has helped fuel a high rate of turnover. Health Secretary Tom Price was forced out and replaced last year after reports emerged of lavish spending on flights. Pruitt and Zinke are viewed as among Trump’s most productive Cabinet officials and key to the president’s policy of expanding energy production and exports by slashing environmental regulations and opening federal lands to drilling and mining. Trump has rebuffed recent calls by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers to fire Pruitt, saying he is doing a “fantastic job” and is well-loved in “coal and energy country.” The Government Accountability Office said the EPA violated the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act with Pruitt’s privacy booth. The law prohibits an agency from obligating more than $5,000 in federal funds to furnish, redecorate or make improvements in the office of a presidential appointee without first notifying appropriations committees in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. Liz Bowman, an EPA spokeswoman, said the agency was “addressing GAO’s concern, with regard to Congressional notification about this expense, and will be sending Congress the necessary information this week.” The booth, which Pruitt had told lawmakers in a hearing was needed to conduct agency business, was built in a former storage closet in the administrator’s office. The GAO had been asked to investigate the matter by Democratic lawmakers. Senator John Barrasso, a Republican and the head of the Senate environment committee, said in a statement after the GAO’s decision that Pruitt’s agency must give a “full public accounting” of the spending. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Also on Monday, the EPA’s Office of Inspector General released documents showing EPA’s chief of staff, Ryan Jackson, had signed off on pay raises for three of Pruitt’s staff, including a raise of $29,000 to above $114,000 for his scheduling director, Millan Hupp. Pruitt had originally recommended the raises but was denied by the White House. Jackson approved them using the authority granted under an obscure provision in a clean water law, the documents said. Pruitt told Fox News this month that he had no knowledge of the raises. EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox did not respond to a request for comment. The Interior Department’s watchdog said in its report Monday that Secretary Zinke chartered a plane for $12,375 from Las Vegas to Kalispell, Montana, in June that “could have been avoided.” The flight was linked to a controversial visit Zinke made to a National Hockey League team owned by a campaign donor. “We determined that Zinke’s use of chartered flights in fiscal year (FY) 2017 generally followed relevant law, policy, rules, and regulations,” the report said. “We found, however, that a $12,375 chartered flight he took in June 2017 after speaking at the developmental camp for the Golden Knights, a professional hockey team based in Las Vegas, Nevada, could have been avoided,” it added. The report said the visit appeared unrelated to Zinke’s work as Interior chief, pointing out that a video recording of the speech showed he never mentioned his role at the department and focused mainly on his experience as a Navy SEAL. The hockey team is owned by Bill Foley, a donor to Zinke’s past congressional campaigns. Heather Swift, an Interior Department spokeswoman, said the report “said exactly what was known all along,” that the chartered aircraft followed relevant law and regulations. She did not comment on the watchdog’s finding that the Las Vegas flight could have been avoided. Zinke has also defended his use of noncommercial aircraft as necessary for reaching the remote parts of the country that his department oversees, and said past Interior secretaries have also relied on them. Zinke has also taken heat for other types of spending, including the repair of doors in his office that cost thousands of dollars.

2018-04-16,"(Reuters) - The United States and Britain on Monday accused Russia of launching cyber attacks on computer routers, firewalls and other networking equipment used by government agencies, businesses and critical infrastructure operators around the globe. Washington and London issued a joint alert saying the campaign by Russian government-backed hackers was intended to advance spying, intellectual property theft and other “malicious” activities and could be escalated to launch offensive attacks. It followed a series of warnings by Western governments that Moscow is behind a string of cyber attacks. The United States, Britain and other nations in February accused Russia of releasing the “NotPetya” virus, which in 2017 crippled parts of Ukraine’s infrastructure and damaged computers across the globe, costing companies billions of dollars. The Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But Russia’s embassy in London issued a statement citing British accusations of cyber threats from Moscow as “striking examples of a reckless, provocative and unfounded policy against Russia.” Moscow has denied previous accusations that it carried out cyber attacks on the United States and other countries. U.S. intelligence agencies last year accused Russia of interfering in the 2016 election with a hacking and propaganda campaign supporting Donald Trump’s campaign for president. Last month the Trump administration blamed Russia for a campaign of cyber attacks that targeted the U.S. power grid. American and British officials said that the attacks disclosed on Monday affected a wide range of organizations including internet service providers, private businesses and critical infrastructure providers. They did not identify victims or provide details on the impact of the attacks. “When we see malicious cyber activity, whether it be from the Kremlin or other malicious nation-state actors, we are going to push back,” said Rob Joyce, the White House cyber security coordinator. Relations between Russia and Britain were already on edge after Prime Minister Theresa May blamed Moscow for the March 4 nerve agent poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the city of Salisbury. “This is yet another example of Russia’s disregard for international norms and global order - this time through a campaign of cyber espionage and aggression, which attempts to disrupt governments and destabilise business,” a British government spokesman said in London. Britain and the United States said they issued the new alert to help targets protect themselves and persuade victims to share information with government investigators so they can better understand the threat. “We don’t have full insight into the scope of the compromise,” said U.S. Department of Homeland Security cyber security official Jeanette Manfra. The alert is not related to the suspected chemical weapons attack in a town in Syria that prompted a U.S.-led military strike over the weekend targeting facilities of the Russian-backed Syrian government, Joyce said. Shortly after the announcement, the White House said Joyce would leave his post and return to the U.S. National Security Agency. U.S. and British officials warned that infected routers could be used to launch future offensive cyber operations. “They could be pre-positioning for use in times of tension,” said Ciaran Martin, chief executive of the British government’s National Cyber Security Centre cyber defence agency, who added that “millions of machines” were targeted.

2018-04-16,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street closed higher on Monday as investors appeared less concerned about possible retaliation for U.S.-led missile strikes on Syria, and the yield curve reached its flattest level in over a decade. Saturday’s strikes were the biggest intervention by Western countries against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whose ally Russia is facing further U.S. economic sanctions over its role in the conflict. “The catalyst had been the concern about trade issues, which is calming down. The bombing in Syria looks to be an event rather than an ongoing thing and it was a coalition,” said Jeffrey Carbone, managing partner, Cornerstone Wealth, in Huntersville, North Carolina.  “Now we get to concentrate on fundamentals,” he said, adding that earnings season is beginning as economic data has shown an accelerating economy. President Donald Trump said on Monday that he will nominate economist Richard Clarida as Federal Reserve Vice Chairman, adding another hawkish voice at the central bank.  The news flattened the spread between five- and 30-year Treasury bonds US5US30=TWEB to 34.6 basis points, the lowest in over 10 years. Expectations of further interest rate increases lifted the short end of the curve earlier in the day, led by the two-year government bond US2YT=RR, which hit 2.394, its highest since September 2008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 212.9 points, or 0.87 percent, to 24,573.04, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 21.54 points, or 0.81 percent, to 2,677.84 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 49.64 points, or 0.7 percent, to 7,156.29. Hopes that the strike against Syria would not escalate also spurred investors to shed the U.S. dollar. The greenback fell 0.41 percent against a basket of major currencies .DXY, while the euro EUR= rose 0.4 percent to $1.2378. European shares eased, adding to a mixed picture from lower Asian stock markets and suggesting that a degree of caution remains. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 0.46 percent. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.39 percent, though emerging market stocks dipped 0.58 percent.  The yields on German DE10YT=RR and 10-year U.S. government US10YT=RR bonds, among the most liquid and safe assets in the world, touched their highest levels in nearly two weeks and four weeks, respectively. That was partly as attention turned to what is expected to be a robust first-quarter U.S. corporate earnings season, which begins in earnest this week.  Some other traditional safe-haven bets held firmer, with gold XAU= and Japan's yen JPY= edging higher. Dealers were keeping a wary eye on Japanese politics after a survey showed support for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had fallen to 26.7 percent, the lowest since he took office in 2012.     Meanwhile, oil prices fell on waning investor concern about Syria. U.S. crude CLcv1 fell 1.62 percent to $66.30 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $71.49, down 1.5 percent on the day.

2018-04-16,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices dropped on Monday as investor concern waned about escalating tensions in the Middle East following air strikes on Syria over the weekend.     The United States, France and Britain launched 105 missiles on Saturday, targeting what they said were three chemical weapons facilities in Syria in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack on April 7. Oil prices had risen nearly 10 percent in the run-up to the strikes, as investors bulked up on assets, such as gold or U.S. Treasuries, that can shield against geopolitical risks. “Some of the ease in Syria is the headline that is bringing it down,” said Phil Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago. Because the attacks were more surgical than anticipated in more extreme scenarios, the market has shrugged off bullish factors, he said.  “It has got everything to possibly boost it: weak dollar, Syria, potential sanctions, White House uncertainty, China trade,” he said.  Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 settled down $1.16 at $71.42, while U.S. crude futures CLc1 were down $1.17 at $66.22 a barrel. “As far as developments in Syria are concerned, the market has had a sigh of relief in the sense that there is no escalation, either diplomatically, or on the ground, following the intervention by the U.S., France and the UK,” said BNP Paribas global head of commodity market strategy Harry Tchilinguirian. “As a macro asset-allocator, if you want to hedge your portfolio against geopolitical risk, your prime candidate is oil, especially if that risk is in the Middle East.” Although Syria itself is not a significant oil producer, the wider Middle East is the world’s most important crude exporter and tension in the region tends to put oil markets on edge. “Investors continued to worry about the impact of a wider conflict in the Middle East,” ANZ bank said. Fund managers hold more Brent futures and options than at any time since records began in 2011, according to data from the InterContinental Exchange. [O/ICE] Investors have added to their bullish positions in Brent, which now equal nearly 640 million barrels of oil, in nine out of the last 10 months. The next event on investors’ radar is potential U.S. withdrawal from a deal on Iran’s nuclear restrictions, signed in 2015. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw the United States from the pact, barring action from Congress and Europe.  Even the imposition of unilateral sanctions by the U.S. government could hamper exports of oil from Iran, one of the world’s largest producers.  “Oil is still holding relatively well and the mid-May Iranian deadline is going to be a bit of a subject for the next four weeks,” Petromatrix strategist Olivier Jakob said.

2018-04-16,"(Adds EPA inspector general report on pay raises for staff by Pruitt’s chief of staff) By Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON, April 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency violated the law when it approved a $43,000 soundproof phone booth last year for the office of embattled Administrator Scott Pruitt, a congressional watchdog unit said on Monday. The Government Accountability Office said the EPA violated the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act. The law prohibits an agency from obligating more than $5,000 in federal funds to furnish, redecorate or make improvements in the office of a presidential appointee without first notifying appropriations committees in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. The EPA also violated the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from incurring expenses in excess of funds available in appropriations, the GAO said. Liz Bowman, an EPA spokeswoman, said the agency was “addressing GAO’s concern, with regard to Congressional notification about this expense, and will be sending Congress the necessary information this week.” The privacy booth, which Pruitt had told lawmakers in a hearing was needed to conduct agency business, was built in a spot of a former storage closet in the administrator’s office. The GAO had been asked to investigate the matter by Democratic lawmakers including U.S. Senators Tom Carper and Tom Udall. Senator John Barrasso, a Republican and the head of the Senate environment committee, earlier this month had rejected a request by Carper and others for a hearing looking into allegations that Pruitt had spent wastefully. But Barrasso said in a statement after the GAO’s decision that Pruitt’s agency must give a “full public accounting” on the spending on the booth and explain why the agency thinks it was complying with the law. Pruitt has been under fire from Republican and Democratic lawmakers for expensive travel and other expenses. Last week, Democratic lawmakers asked him to provide documents about ethics issues they said were revealed to them by a former agency official, including spending on bulletproof vests, guns and a contract with an Italian security service. Also last week, fellow Republican Trey Gowdy, head of the oversight committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, asked Pruitt for more documents for his probe into the administrator’s first-class air travel and leasing of a room in a Washington condo for $50 a night for nights he was there. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the GAO decision.

2018-04-16,"VANCOUVER, April 16 (Reuters) - Alberta officials will introduce legislation on Monday expected to give the provincial government power to cut oil shipments to neighboring British Columbia in an escalation of a row over the stalled expansion of a Kinder Morgan Canada pipeline, which the Pacific province opposes. The Trans Mountain expansion issue has pitted Ottawa against British Columbia (B.C.). It could turn into a constitutional crisis, derail Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s energy strategy and dent business confidence. Alberta’s legislation, slated for Monday afternoon, could make gasoline more expensive in British Columbia and comes a day after an emergency summit to unlock the stalemate failed. On Sunday, Trudeau pledged financial aid to the C$7.4 billion ($5.9 billion) project, reiterating Ottawa has jurisdiction over it and it will be built. But shortly after the summit ended, B.C. Premier John Horgan tweeted: “I will continue to fight to defend B.C. jobs, our economy and environment – now, and for future generations.” Horgan campaigned on a pledge to block the expansion, which would nearly triple capacity on the existing pipeline from Alberta to B.C.’s coast. Trudeau said his government would draft legislation, which is unlikely to come for several weeks, to reaffirm federal jurisdiction over the issue. The legislation and financial aid have the same aim “of making sure that one, that this pipeline will be built and two, that all of the investors involved know that we take this seriously and they can be confident it will go through,” said a source close to the government. Kinder Morgan Canada’s shares rose in early trading and then dipped to C$17.17 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, down 8 Canadian cents. The energy sector as a whole was also slightly down as oil prices slipped. Twenty-eight Kinder Morgan pipeline protesters who have been arrested for civil contempt at the company’s Burnaby Mountain facilities were due to appear in court on Monday. More than 170 people, including federal Green Party leader Elizabeth May, have been arrested since mid-March for violating a civil injunction obtained by Kinder Morgan. “We continue to regard the calculus as fraught, and believe the failure to resolve legal challenges make the actual construction of (the Trans Mountain expansion)difficult – even with federal government intervention,” Credit Suisse analysts said in a research note on Monday. Oil producers and the Alberta government are desperate for the pipeline to go ahead, as rising production has outstripped existing pipeline capacity, leading to a widening of the normal differential between Western Canadian oil prices and the U.S. benchmark. $1 = 1.2576 Canadian dollars

Saturday’s strikes were the biggest intervention by Western countries against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his ally Russia, which is facing further economic sanctions over its role in the conflict. “There is a feeling (in the market) that there will be no follow-up action,” Rabobank fixed income analyst Lyn Graham-Taylor said.

2018-04-16,"(Adds natural gas data) NEW YORK, April 16 (Reuters) - U.S. shale oil production is expected to increase in May for the fourth consecutive month, U.S. Energy Information Administration data showed on Monday, boosted by record production in the prolific Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. Total oil output is set to rise by 125,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 7 million bpd, the EIA said in its monthly drilling productivity report. Production in the Permian Basin is expected to jump by 73,000 bpd to 3.2 million bpd, the largest according to records dating back to 2007. The expanding production there has led to bottlenecks as pipelines transporting the crude have filled more quickly than expected. Bakken output is expected to rise by 15,000 bpd to 1.2 million bpd, the highest since July 2015. In the Eagle Ford shale fields, production is set to rise by 24,000 bpd to 1.3 million bpd, the most since May 2016. Meanwhile, U.S. natural gas production was projected to increase to a record 66.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in May, the highest on record. That would be up more than 1 bcfd over the April forecast. Output in the Appalachia region, the biggest shale gas play, was set to rise by almost 0.4 bcfd to a record high of 27.7 bcfd in May.

The move sets up a showdown at SandRidge’s annual meeting later this year between the existing board and the hard-driving investor who has been trying to force the company to sell itself outright to either himself or another potential bidder. Icahn has spent recent months blasting SandRidge’s leadership, at one point accusing it of an apparent “disregard for any semblance of accountability.” He has successfully scuttled SandRidge’s planned buyout of rival Bonanza Creek Energy Inc (BCEI.N) and forced the removal of the company’s chief executive and finance chief. Now, Icahn has set his sights on the company’s board.     A SandRidge spokesperson said the company will be reviewing Icahn’s proposed candidates and declined further comment.   Icahn, who waited until a Monday deadline to nominate his slate, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares of Oklahoma City-based SandRidge, which produces oil in Oklahoma and Colorado, were off a penny at $14.64 in afternoon trading on Monday.  SandRidge’s stock has lost nearly a third of its value since January, far below levels where Icahn first amassed his majority stake last fall. Icahn had telegraphed earlier this month that he was likely to nominate directors. He has said he is willing to make an all-cash offer to buy the company. SandRidge has not set a date for its 2018 shareholder meeting. The 2017 meeting was held in June. Most companies hold their annual meetings at the same time each year. Icahn’s slate includes current employees and employees or board members of companies he has controlled. Icahn, who owns about 13.5 percent of SandRidge’s float, nominated Jonathan Frates and Nicholas Graziano, both of whom work for the investor’s companies.  The other three nominees are John Lipinski and Bob Alexander who have worked with refining company CVR Energy Inc (CVI.N), which is majority owned by Icahn, and Randolph Read, who has worked with investment fund Nevada Strategic Credit Investment. Icahn has not always been successful in agitating for change at energy companies. In 2016, his hand-picked director at Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) resigned in what was widely seen as a tacit admission that the investor’s turnaround strategy was not working fast enough.

2018-04-16,"(Adds context, details on operations) By Marianna Parraga April 16 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s oil refineries worked at 31 percent of their combined 1.62 million-barrel-per-day capacity in the first quarter, well below 2017 levels, according to an internal document from state-run firm PDVSA viewed by Reuters. PDVSA’s refining operations have been degraded in recent years due to lack of cash for spare parts and maintenance, and insufficient light oil for the facilities. Staff departures, which have particularly affected the firm’s refineries, have become the most recent obstacle to sustaining output levels. The company’s Amuay, Cardon, Isla, Puerto la Cruz and El Palito refineries processed 510,000 bpd of crude in the first quarter, down sharply from a 631,000 bpd average in all of 2017, the document said. The very low processing rate, worse than in Mexico, where growing fuel imports have displaced domestic production, has led to a lack of refined products to fulfill the country’s export commitments, according to the report. In May, PDVSA will face a deficit of 14,000 bpd - mainly diesel and jet fuel- for export contracts, even though Venezuela’s fuel consumption this year has remained well below the peak of 750,000 bpd registered a decade ago. Declining domestic demand should have left a surplus for shipping abroad. Instead, the deficit continues to cause delays in exports, with customers receiving only a portion of the cargoes promised. The lack of spare parts and feedstock to operate the refineries properly is PDVSA’s most recurrent problem. But a lack of crude has become another big issue, forcing the firm to boost oil imports, according to the document. PDVSA did not respond a request for comment. PDVSA lowered its expectation for refining in May compared with April to 647,000 bpd, 39.9 percent of capacity, due to longer-than-expected maintenance projects. The firm was hoping to restart one of the Amuay refinery’s five atmospheric distillation units in April, but has postponed it without setting a new deadline. At Cardon, a vacuum distillation unit is out of service, while the reformer and a diesel hydrotreater are working with limitations. At the 335,000-bpd Isla refinery in Curacao, the restart of several units under maintenance since February and April was delayed to May, including two crude units, an alkylation unit, a catalytic cracker and two hydrotreaters, the document showed. At El Palito and Puerto la Cruz, an acute lack of medium crude has forced a halt to key units.

2018-04-16,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s Europe minister called on Monday for a new policy of easing tensions with Russia, adding to a chorus of voices pressing Chancellor Angela Merkel to moderate her hardened stance towards the Kremlin. The conservative chancellor swung behind Britain after the poison attack on a former Russian double agent in England last month, expelling four diplomats despite uneasiness among a political class that is wary of confrontation with Germany’s giant eastern neighbour. Europe Minister Michael Roth, a member of the Social Democrat party (SPD), said that while the European Union needed a united front on Russia, sanctions should aim to bring Moscow to the negotiating table. “Anti-Russian reflexes are just as dangerous as naively... remaining silent over the nationalist-tinged policies of the current Russian leadership,” he wrote in Die Welt newspaper. Many Western countries are pushing for a more assertive stance against Moscow over President Vladimir Putin’s backing for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, accused of using chemical weapons in the country’s civil war. Merkel’s tone has hardened over the four years since Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula, which led to Western nations imposing the sanctions on Moscow.  But with extensive business and energy links to Russia, Germany has been traditionally cautious in its relations with Moscow - a view reflected on Monday by a close Merkel ally.  Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, secretary general of Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU), said she backed “actively using the channels of communication that we have with Russia”, adding: “That’s certainly an area where the chancellor can play a decisive role.” Kramp-Karrenbauer - tipped as a possible successor to Merkel - said a debate was underway among the conservatives about whether sanctions made sense, although she added that unjust acts committed by Russia needed to be penalised. The German Committee on Eastern European Economic Relations, a business lobby group, expressed concern about a new wave of U.S. sanctions. These could hit European companies that had supported “significant transactions” on behalf of blacklisted Russian individuals, it said, adding that the German government and Brussels needed to protect EU firms from sanctions. Roth, whose party is junior partner in Merkel’s coalition, echoed comments from President Frank-Walter Steinmeier - a fellow Social Democrat - that “too much is at stake” for Germany to cast Russia as an enemy. Opinion in the coalition is not necessarily divided along party lines. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, also a Social Democrat, has appeared to shift away from a conciliatory approach to Moscow while Alexander Dobrindt, a lawmaker for Merkel’s Bavarian sister party, has questioned the effectiveness of the sanctions against Russia. The sequence of interventions, by Roth and Steinmeier from the SPD, and Dobrindt and former defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg on the right, highlight how Merkel’s diminished authority in her fourth and likely final term in office is limiting her room for manoeuvre. Guttenberg, himself once tipped as a potential Merkel successor before his fall from grace in an academic plagiarism scandal, criticised the government for its policy towards intervention in Syria in the face of a cynical Russia. “We make it easy for ourselves, letting the others do the dirty work,” he said of Merkel’s decision not to participate in  missile strikes launched by the United States, Britain and France on Syria last week after its suspected use of chemical weapons. “It is good that somebody still acts when someone kills children, innocent people,” he told mass-selling Bild newspaper.

Saturday’s strikes marked the biggest intervention by Western countries against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his ally Russia, which is facing further economic sanctions over its role in the conflict. “There is a feeling (in the market) that there will be no follow-up action,” Rabobank fixed income analyst Lyn Graham-Taylor said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 190.35 points, or 0.78 percent, to 24,550.49, the S&P 500 gained 16.89 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,673.19 and the Nasdaq Composite added 29.31 points, or 0.41 percent, to 7,135.96. “The action was well-received ... and that’s giving a chance for investors to focus on macro news and earnings,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. Healthcare shares also rose after positive updates on a cancer drug from Merck. Hopes that the strike against Syria would not escalate further also spurred investors to shed the U.S. dollar. The dollar index fell 0.3 percent, with the euro up 0.28 percent to $1.2364. European shares eased, however, adding to a mixed picture from Asian stock markets and suggesting that a degree of caution prevails. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.41 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.5 percent lower, as Chinese blue-chips skidded 1.6 percent. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.30 percent. European and U.S. government bond yields, which move inversely to prices, rose across the board. That was partly as attention turned to what is expected to be a robust first-quarter U.S. corporate earnings season, which begins in earnest this week. The yields on German and U.S. government bonds, among the most liquid and safe assets in the world, were at their highest levels in nearly two weeks and four weeks, respectively. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 5/32 in price to yield 2.8469 percent, from 2.828 percent late on Friday. The 30-year bond last fell 7/32 in price to yield 3.0463 percent, from 3.036 percent. Some other traditional safe-haven bets held firmer, with gold and Japan’s yen edging higher. Dealers were keeping a wary eye on Japanese politics after a survey showed support for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had fallen to 26.7 percent, the lowest since he took office in late 2012. Even so, Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.26 percent. Oil prices, meanwhile, recouped some losses after falling sharply. Brent crude was last at $71.78, down 1.1 percent on the day, with a rise in U.S. drilling for new production also dragging on prices. U.S. crude fell 1.34 percent to $66.49 per barrel.

2018-04-16,"YEREVAN, April 16 (Reuters) - Around 6,000 gathered in Armenia’s capital on Monday in protest at what the opposition calls a power grab by former president Serzh Sarksyan and several people were injured in scuffles with police. Hundreds of opposition activists have held rallies in recent weeks to protest at Sarksyan’s campaign to become prime minister after a constitutional amendment approved in 2015 that transfers governing powers to the premier from the presidency. The number of protesters has grown to thousands in recent days with protesters blocking the centre of Yerevan, capital of the former Soviet republic. A Reuters correspondent saw at least three protesters with blood on their hands and legs after scuffles broke out in the city centre. Local media quoted a hospital doctor as saying three policemen and one protester had been injured. Police warned demonstrators they would use tear gas and other means to disperse protesters if they did not leave the Opera House square and unblock the city centre. The ruling Republican party nominated Sarksyan, who served as president for a decade from 2008, as its candidate for prime minister on Saturday. Sarksyan’s ally Armen Sarkissian, a former premier and ambassador to Britain, was sworn in as president last week after being elected by parliament in a vote that was meant to herald the start of a power shift to the premier and parliament. Under the terms of an amended constitution approved in 2015 by referendum, the presidency will become largely ceremonial. Parliament, which is dominated by the ruling party, is to decide on Tuesday whether to install Sarkysan as prime minister. The Dashnaktsutsiun Party, the Republicans’ coalition ally, also backs Sarksyan’s candidacy, meaning he should easily secure the simple majority needed for election. No other candidates are running. Opposition leaders have accused Sarksyan of changing the nation’s political system to ensure he can remain in power. Sarksyan had denied any intention of becoming premier until March, when he said his appointment would allow him to share the benefit of his experience as president. Armenia, a country of three million people in the southern Caucasus, seceded in 1991 from the then-Soviet Union but still relies on Russia for aid and investment. Many Armenians accuse the government of corruption and mismanaging the economy.

2018-04-16,"OSLO (Reuters) - International experts have not been able to find what caused a cloud of radioactive pollution that spread over Europe last year and prompted fears of a nuclear leak, Swedish authorities said on Monday. Monitoring stations recorded high levels of a radioactive isotope in the air over most European cities at the beginning of October. Scientists from France said soon afterwards they thought the source was an accident at a nuclear facility in Russia or Kazakhstan - a suggestion dismissed by both countries.  A group of experts formed to investigate the incident had now decided there was not enough information to pinpoint the origin, Sweden’s radiation safety authority, one of the group’s members, said on Monday. “Available data does not provide sufficient information to verify that the Ru-106 emissions originate from any of the activities that have been assumed to cause the event,” the Swedish authority said. The authority was referring to ruthenium 106, the radioactive isotope identified by the monitoring stations that does not occur naturally and is the product of splitting atoms in a nuclear reaction. The commission of experts met last week and decided that its member groups - from Russia, Sweden, France, Germany, Britain, Finland and Norway - could return to their countries and carry on their research independently, said Sweden. France’s nuclear safety institute IRSN said in November that the likely source was an accident at a nuclear fuel treatment site or centre for radioactive medicine. It said its findings ruled out a nuclear reactor. It added there had been no impact on human health or the environment in Europe.

2018-04-16,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP said on Monday it will keep carbon emissions flat over the decade to 2025 even as its oil and gas ouput is set to grow, responding to rising investor pressure to help tackle climate change. The London-based company said it plans to reduce emissions of CO2 gases by 3.5 million tonnes by 2025 through higher production of gas, the least polluting fossil fuel, reducing leakage of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and limiting flaring of excess gas.  BP also plans to invest up to $500 million per year on  renewable energies such as solar, wind and power storage. As a result, BP said it plans to keep net emissions from its operations stable between 2015 and 2025. The company uses its 2015 emissions of 51.2 million tonnes of CO2 as a baseline. “We now know that a race to renewables will not be enough. To deliver significantly lower emissions every type of energy needs to be cleaner and better,” Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said in a statement. Dudley has led calls for the energy sector to play a leading role in the transition towards low-carbon energy following a landmark 2015 Paris agreement to limit global warming by the end of the century. He nevertheless said that expected growth in demand for energy means oil and gas companies such as BP will have to invest in new production while slowly growing a low carbon business. BP’s near-term targets contrast with ambitions that rival Royal Dutch Shell outlined last November to halve emissions from its operations as well as from fuel it sells by 2050, known as scope 3 emissions. BP’s reduction targets do not include scope 3. The company planned to grow its production by 900,000 barrels per day of oil and gas between 2015 and 2021. Its production was around 3.6 million bpd in 2017.

2018-04-16,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A fight over the planned privatisation of Dutch energy company Eneco resurfaced on Monday as its works council called for an inquiry after the company announced that its CEO will step down in September. A large majority of the company’s 53 municipal shareholders voted in October to privatise Eneco, while CEO Jeroen de Haas and works council chairman Willem Hofman had lobbied against it and pressed for conditions including preservation of its profile as a renewables-focused business. The company said on Monday that De Haas, CEO since 2007, will leave on Sept. 1. Eneco said its supervisory board reached the decision “in close consultation” with De Haas but declined to clarify the reasons for his departure. Hours later the works council issued a statement signed by Hofman, saying it will ask the Amsterdam Enterprise Chamber to launch an inquiry into De Haas’s departure and other recent actions of the supervisory board. Eneco spokesman Edwin van de Haar read a statement from the company’s supervisory board, saying that it is preparing for the works council’s actions.  After months of feuding, shareholders and Eneco’s boards had agreed in February that the company would be sold, paving the way for privatisation in the coming months. Details of the sale process have not yet been made public, but sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that the company was seeking a trade sale as its preferred option, with an initial public offering as second choice. Despite the agreement with shareholders, Eneco’s works council said it still fears a sale to a party that would harm its sustainable profile.  “Basically it comes down to the question whether it would be conceivable for Eneco to be bought by a company like (Royal Dutch) Shell (RDSa.L),” spokesman Jan Driessen said.  Eneco, estimated to be worth about 4 billion euros (3.46 billion pounds), is heavily invested in sustainable energy projects and could appeal to companies that want to increase exposure to renewables. Potential bidders include Shell, Total SA (TOTF.PA), Enel (ENEI.MI), Engie (ENGIE.PA), Verbund (VERB.VI), Orsted (ORSTED.CO) and Fortum (FORTUM.HE).

2018-04-16,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is likely to receive average monsoon rains in 2018, the weather office said, raising the possibility of higher farm and economic growth in Asia’s third-biggest economy, where half of the farmland lacks irrigation. Monsoon rains, the lifeblood of the country’s $2 trillion economy, are expected to be 97 percent of a long-term average, K.J. Ramesh, director general of the state-run India Meteorological Department (IMD), told a news conference. “We see very less probability of a deficit monsoon,” Ramesh said on Monday. Other than lifting farm and wider economic growth, a spell of good rains will keep a lid on inflation, potentially tempting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bring forward general elections due in May 2019. India’s weather office defines average, or normal, rainfall as between 96 percent and 104 percent of a 50-year average of 89 cms for the entire four-month season beginning June. “The moderate La Nina conditions developed in the equatorial Pacific during last year started weakening in the early part of this year and currently have turned to weak La Nina conditions,” IMD said in a statement. La Nina is a weather pattern that brings equatorial Pacific Ocean temperatures, rainfall patterns and winds closer to average. The latest forecasts from global models indicate conditions over the Pacific will turn neutral before the beginning of monsoon season, the IMD said. Good rains will spur the planting of crops such as rice, corn, cotton and soybeans, accelerating economic growth that rose 7.2 percent in the December quarter, its fastest in five quarters, compared with China’s 6.8 percent in that quarter. Growth in the December quarter restored India’s status as the world’s fastest growing major economy. Average monsoon rains, with good distribution in July and August would support rural demand, said Rupa Rege Nitsure, group chief economist at L&T Finance Holdings, a Mumbai-based non-banking finance company. Good rains boost rural incomes, lifting the demand for an array of consumer goods ranging from lipsticks to refrigerators. An average monsoon would keep food inflation lower, Nitsure said. On Monday, government data showed India’s wholesale food prices fell 0.07 percent in March 2018 from a year earlier. India’s weather office will update its forecast in June. On an average, the IMD has forecast accurately only once in every five years over the past two decades, even after taking into account an error band of plus or minus 5 percentage points. Rains usually lash Kerala state on the south coast around June 1, and cover the whole country by mid-July. Timely rains trigger planting of crops such as rice, soybeans and cotton. The monsoon usually covers the half of the country in the first 15 days. The rains reach central India’s soybean areas by the third week of June and western cotton-growing areas by the first week of July. Good rains would help boost soybean output which in turn could cut expensive vegetable oil imports by India, the world’s biggest importer of edible oils, which is the third-biggest import item after crude oil and gold.

2018-04-16,"LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell defended its ambition to cut carbon emissions on Monday, urging investors to oppose a shareholder resolution arguing that the oil and gas giant is not doing enough to meet international targets to tackle climate change. The Anglo-Dutch company, like many of its peers, has faced growing investor pressure to address the need to reduce fossil fuel burning, forcing it to seek a delicate balance with a need to secure growing returns from its traditional business.  Last November, Shell outlined plans to halve carbon emissions from its operations and sales of its fuels by 2050, responding to stepped-up investor pressure with what is seen as one of the most ambitious goals in the sector. (For a graphic on 'Shell carbon reduction goals' click reut.rs/2JOGJgZ) But Follow This, a climate activist shareholder group, put forward a resolution that will be voted on at Shell’s annual general meeting next month urging it to set more aggressive targets aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement goal of limiting global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius. “I don’t think a 50 percent reduction of CO2 emissions footprint in 2050 meets the Paris climate agreement,” Mark van Baal, founder of Follow This, told Reuters. “Shell uses these ambitions to do business as usual in the next decades.” The company should stop exploring for new oil and gas resources and shift to renewable energy, van Baal said. Last year’s resolution by Follow This on the topic won the support of 6.3 percent of shareholders but the debate around Shell’s climate strategy has become central in recent years. Shell’s management urged shareholders to vote against the resolution at the AGM which will be held in the Hague on May 22. “We share the objective of Follow This for Shell to show leadership in the energy transition but at the same time we consider the resolution unnecessary given that we have already outlined an approach that is much wider-ranging and much more progressive,” Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden told reporters in a phone briefing. Shell will have to initially “catch up” with society’s carbon reduction goals because Shell’s current emissions are higher than other businesses but by 2050 it plans to be in line with the global targets. “We’ll be aligned with society’s progress but we will not be tied to an approach that potentially moves too quickly or too slowly to this transition,” van Beurden said. Van Beurden admitted that the transition could have a “very significant” impact on Shell’s business in the long run. Shell plans to reduce its emissions by increasing the share of gas and biofuels production, investing in renewable energy such as solar and offshore wind as well as in technologies to capture carbon and tree-planting, van Beurden said. Shell plans to invest between $1-$2 billion per year on its low-carbon energy business by the end of the decade, less than a tenth of its planned annual spending but significantly higher than its rivals.

2018-04-16,"* U.S., German govt bond yields hit three-week highs * Oil prices drop more than 1.5 percent * Stocks remain flat ahead of U.S. earnings * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Adds U.S. stock futures, updates prices) By Abhinav Ramnarayan LONDON, April 16 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell sharply and government bond yields rose on Monday on the view that this weekend’s U.S.-led missile strikes on Syria were unlikely to mark the start of a broader conflict. Saturday’s strikes marked the biggest intervention by Western countries against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his ally Russia, which is facing further economic sanctions over its role in the conflict. “There is a feeling (in the market) that there will be no follow-up action,” Rabobank fixed income analyst Lyn Graham-Taylor said. European shares eased, however, adding to a mixed picture from Asian stock markets and suggesting that a degree of caution prevails. While last week’s bid for investment safety in top-rated government bonds unwound, other traditional safe-haven bets held firmer. Gold prices were little changed, while Japan’s yen and the Swiss franc were higher than levels seen late on Friday. European and U.S. government bond yields, which move inversely to prices, rose across the board. That was partly as attention turned to what is expected to be a robust first-quarter U.S. corporate earnings season, which begins in earnest this week. The yield on both German and U.S. 10-year government bonds, seen as among the most liquid and safe assets in the world, were at their highest levels for three weeks. Oil prices, meanwhile, dropped sharply. Brent crude fell more than 1 percent to $71.78 a barrel, with a rise in U.S. drilling for new production also dragging on prices. MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was flat on the day and a benchmark pan-European stock index was marginally lower. U.S. stock futures were pointing to a higher opening on Wall Street, with Dow and S&P Futures up 0.6 percent each and Nasdaq futures up 0.7 percent. First quarter earnings for U.S. companies will be very important after February’s sell-off, Lombard Odier Investment Managers chief investment strategist Salman Ahmed said. “If there is a genuine dent in earnings, people will sit up and take notice,” he said, noting that regulation will be a powerful driver for the technology sector, citing the example of Facebook, as well as the banking industry. The dollar failed to hold its early gains on the yen and eased to 107.27, though that was still up on last week’s low around 106.62. Dealers were keeping a wary eye on Japanese politics after a survey showed support for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had fallen to 26.7 percent, the lowest since he took office in late 2012. Abe’s sliding ratings are raising doubts about whether he can win a third three-year term as ruling Liberal Democratic Party leader in a September vote, or if he might even resign before the party election. “For markets, the question is whether this matters for economic policy,” UBS Wealth Management global chief economist Paul Donovan said. “A change in leadership may matter if the next prime minister has a radically different agenda.” Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.3 percent while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.4 percent as Chinese blue-chips skidded 1.7 percent. The euro was a higher at $1.2368, while the dollar index eased to 89.540.

2018-04-16,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2EQ0vFd By John Kemp LONDON, April 16 (Reuters) - Hedge funds are holding a near-record bullish position in crude oil and refined fuels but the buying seems to have run out of momentum and is increasingly concentrated only in Brent. Hedge funds and other money managers increased their net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum by 12 million barrels in the week to April 10. The net long position has increased by 149 million barrels over the last four weeks to 1.365 billion barrels. Net length across the petroleum complex is only 118 million below the record of 1.484 billion set on Jan. 23. But the increasing bullishness is becoming more selective and is almost entirely concentrated in Brent, according to an analysis of position records published by regulators and exchanges. Portfolio managers increased their net long position in Brent by 17 million barrels in the week to April 10 and have raised net length by a total of 48 million barrels since Jan. 23. By contrast, the net long position in WTI was cut by 3 million barrels last week and is down by 108 million barrels since Jan. 23. Net positions in U.S. gasoline, U.S. heating oil and European gasoil were cut or essentially unchanged in the most recent week (tmsnrt.rs/2EQ0vFd). The result is an increasing divergence between Brent and WTI and to a lesser extent between Brent and refined fuels. Portfolio managers now hold a record net long position of 632 million barrels in Brent, up from 584 million on Jan. 23. Hedge fund long positions outnumber shorts in Brent by more than 20:1, up from a ratio of 11:1 back in January. There are plenty of reasons to be bullish about crude prices, including strong growth in oil consumption, continued output restrictions by OPEC, disruption in Venezuela, and the threat of new sanctions on Iran. OPEC members have indicated they want to see a further rise in oil prices to stimulate more upstream investment and may be targeting prices as high as $80 per barrel, up from just over $70 currently. The latest position data refers to positions at the end of trading on April 10, before the United States and its allies launched air strikes on Syria in the early hours of April 14. Rising political and military tensions across the Middle East, including in Syria and Yemen, have created a speculative bid for oil prices. Nonetheless, hedge fund positioning in Brent has become exceptionally stretched and is a significant source of downside risk if and when fund managers try to realise some of their profits.

2018-04-16,"OSLO (Reuters) - The global aluminium market could face supply shortages because of U.S. sanctions on Russia and Norsk Hydro’s production cuts in Brazil, Hydro’s chief executive told Reuters on Monday. Industries ranging from automakers to soda-can producers are worrying over deliveries and sharp price hikes, Svein Richard Brandtzaeg said in an interview. Over the weekend, Hydro cut output from the Albras aluminium plant in Brazil by half, as it had previously warned, in response to an unresolved dispute at its nearby Alunorte alumina refinery, which supplies the key raw material. “If this lasts long, it’s possible it will also lead to production cuts at our Norwegian smelters, which also receive alumina from Alunorte,” Brandtzaeg said. “This is not positive for the aluminium industry. We’ve got long-term customers seeking stable relations, and our car-making customers are particularly worried in this situation, both by the prices but also by the cost of delivery premiums,” he added. Aluminium prices hit six-year highs on the London Metal Exchange on Monday, continuing a spike that began when the United States imposed sanctions on UC Rusal, the world’s second-biggest producer, as well as Hydro’s own cuts. “There is a shortage of alumina, and there will also be a shortage of aluminium unless Rusal can find new markets quite quickly,” Brandtzaeg said at Hydro’s headquarters in Oslo. Rusal could potentially maintain its production by exporting more to Asian countries, although this could in turn disrupt the regional market balance, he added. “The metal would remain part of the global balance and we’d have to expect more exports from Asia into our European markets, particularly since China faces restrictions on exports to the U.S.,” Brandtzaeg said. U.S. President Donald Trump last month imposed import tariffs of 10 percent on aluminium and 25 percent on steel to protect U.S. metal producers from cheap imports. Rio Tinto’s declaration of force majeure on certain customer contracts as a result of the U.S. sanctions on Rusal also boosted aluminium prices on Monday. Hydro’s cutbacks at Albras, South America’s largest aluminium plant with an annual capacity of 460,000 tonnes, amount to an equivalent of 230,000 tonnes per year, and will last until Alunorte is back to full capacity. Following heavy rains in February, Hydro admitted there had been unregulated emissions of water into a river at the Alunorte plant, but denied it had contaminated the environment. Alunorte, the world’s largest alumina refinery, declared force majeure after Brazilian authorities ordered it to halve its production.

2018-04-16,"KATOWICE, Poland, April 16 (Reuters) - State-run PGG, Poland’s biggest coal mining firm, expects capital expenditure to rise this year to 2.56 billion zlotys  ($759.67 million) from 1.82 billion in 2017, it said on Monday. PGG’s coal output in 2017 was about 30 million tonnes, lower than originally planned as cost cutting pushed down investment. PGG also said it booked a net profit of 86 million zlotys in 2017 compared with a net loss of 332 million zlotys in 2016. A fall in coal prices and high labour costs pushed PGG to the brink of bankruptcy in 2015. In 2016 state-run utilities bought shares in PGG, helping it avoid collapse. “We are generating positive cash flows at the moment, which enable financing investment, this is why we do not need financing from our shareholders,” PGG Chief Executive Tomasz Rogala told reporters.

2018-04-16,"MUMBAI, April 16 (Reuters) - India’s monsoon rains are likely to be 97 percent of their long-term average in 2018, its meteorological department said on Monday, reassuring farmers ahead of summer planting in a country where only half of the farmland is irrigated. What are the categories of monsoon? A normal, or average, monsoon means rainfall between 96 percent and 104 percent of a 50-year average of 89 cm (35 inches) in total during the four-month monsoon season from June, according to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) classification. Rainfall below 90 percent of the average would be classified as a drought. During Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first two years in office, in 2014 and 2015, there were consecutive droughts that led to some criticism here due to the government's handling of the issue. Rainfall above 110 percent of the average would mean an excessive monsoon, which would not be as damaging as a drought but could be potentially harmful for the yields of certain crops. The monsoon season starts with rains on the southern Kerala coast around June 1, covering the whole country by the middle of July. Why is the monsoon important? The monsoon delivers about 70 percent of India’s annual rainfall and determines the yield of key crops such as rice, wheat, sugarcane and oilseeds such as soybeans. The farm sector accounts for about 15 percent of India’s $2 trillion economy, but employs more than half of the country’s 1.3 billion people. If monsoon rains lift farm output, it can boost demand for consumer goods as it raises incomes of rural people. A stronger economic outlook would lift equities, mainly for companies selling products in rural areas, including consumer goods, automobiles, fertilisers and pesticides. India is self-sufficient in crops such as rice and wheat, but a drought would require the country to import foodstuffs. In 2009, India imported sugar after poor rains, sending global prices to record highs and pushing up local inflation. Monsoon rains replenish reservoirs and groundwater, allowing better irrigation and more hydropower output. Higher rainfall can trim demand for subsidised diesel, which is used to pump water from wells for irrigation. How does the monsoon affect inflation and central bank policy? Food accounts for 50 percent of India’s consumer price index, which the central bank closely monitors while deciding on monetary policy. A bumper farm output would keep food prices under control. During past droughts, the government supported farmers by giving out incentives, straining the fiscal deficit. A good monsoon will limit government spending on such measures. How reliable is the monsoon forecast? The IMD issues its first forecast typically more than a month ahead of the monsoon’s onset. On average, its forecast has been accurate only once every five years over the past two decades, even after taking into account an error band of plus or minus 5 percentage points. The IMD’s forecast for the 2017 monsoon was its most accurate since 2008. Last year, there was a difference of only 1 percentage point between the forecast and the actual rainfall. Even during normal monsoon years, some parts of India face drought, while some others suffer from floods. The IMD will come out with a second forecast for the 2018 monsoon rains in June. Why is the monsoon important for Prime Minister Modi ahead of the 2019 elections? Modi, who has promised to double farmers’ income over five years, remains popular nearly four years into his term. Farmer unrest, however, has flared in some states ruled by his party, catching regional leaders flat-footed. A normal monsoon could lead to higher output of summer-sown crops, helping state leaders placate farmers. Reporting by Rajendra Jadhav; Additional reporting by

The level of demand is likely to determine whether the project on the island of Krk will go ahead. “The first round for submitting binding bids ended on April 8. The second round will finish on May 6 and, in case a third round is necessary, it will close on May 23,” the managing director of LNG Hrvatska, Goran Francic, told Reuters. “The final results of demand for buying capacities in the terminal will be released on May 28.” LNG Hrvatska is preparing to build the floating terminal, which Croatia hopes will start operations in early 2020. The final investment decision is expected by the end of June. The terminal, with projected capacity of 2.6 billion cubic metres of gas a year, is part of European Union efforts to diversify away from Russian energy imports, most notably for countries in central Europe. The EU has said it would finance 28 percent of the terminal’s value, or 101.4 million euros ($125 million). The Jutarnji List daily reported over the weekend, citing sources familiar to the process, that demand reached only four percent of overall capacity in the first round of the tender. “Given the confidentiality of the procedure we cannot comment on the first round results, but with a knowledge of how the gas traders operate we can expect their active involvement in the following rounds as the first round usually revolves around testing the market and competition,” Francic said. $1 = 0.8089 euros

2018-04-16,"AMSTERDAM, April 16 (Reuters) - Eneco, the Dutch energy company on the verge of being privatised, is looking for a new chief executive to replace Jeroen de Haas who will step down on Sept. 1, its supervisory board said on Monday. The decision to appoint a new CEO was reached “in close consultation” with De Haas, the board said, while declining to clarify the reasons for his departure. In recent months, De Haas, who has led Eneco since 2007, has clashed with a group representing shareholders over the company’s sale process. The 53 cities that currently own Eneco voted by a large majority to sell the company in October, but met resistance from the company’s boards, which preferred a stock market listing or partial sale that would ensure its continuity as a renewables-oriented firm. After months of feuding, shareholders and Eneco’s management boards finally agreed in February the firm would be sold, paving the way for a privatisation in the coming months. Details of the sale process have not yet been made public. Company spokesman Edwin van de Haar said de Haas’ departure was not expected to have any effect on the sale. Eneco, estimated to be worth around 4 billion euros ($4.9 billion), is heavily invested in sustainable energy projects and could appeal to energy companies that want to increase exposure to renewable production.

2018-04-16,"(Repeats April 15 story with no changes to text) By David Ljunggren OTTAWA, April 15 (Reuters) - Canada’s government got just 24 hours notice that it would be thrust into a political and economic crisis by an ultimatum from a pipeline operator, government sources said, leaving Prime Minister Justin Trudeau scrambling for options in a dispute that could damage his re-election chances. The Kinder Morgan Canada pipeline issue has pitted Ottawa against the Pacific province of British Columbia and could turn into a constitutional crisis, derail Trudeau’s energy strategy and dent business confidence. Trudeau broke off a foreign trip to hold an emergency meeting on Sunday with the premiers of two provinces locked in a standoff over the pipeline after the company set a May 31 deadline to resolve the impasse or it would walk away. Federal officials had been talking to the company since February when British Columbia’s left-leaning coalition, which includes the Green party, made clear it would delay the planned expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline from Alberta’s oil sands to the coast. But the government had no idea that Kinder Morgan Canada was about to drop a bombshell. “Kinder Morgan’s announcement on Sunday was unexpected,” said a senior government official who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the situation. “We had 24 hours’ notice.” The move by Kinder Morgan Canada, which was spun off by its U.S. parent last year, puts pressure on Trudeau to solve the problem without alienating voters in British Columbia or presiding over an investment failure ahead of 2019 elections. A second federal government source said the prime minister and senior cabinet members had worked behind the scenes for weeks, pressing British Columbia to change its position. “If we’re talking of things going awry, British Columbia knew this was federal jurisdiction,” said the source. The operator wants to almost triple the capacity of the existing pipeline. Ottawa, which approved the project in 2016, insists it has jurisdiction. British Columbia’s government, elected in 2017, disagrees, citing the risk of a spill. “I do believe we have a mandate to defend the coast,” provincial Premier John Horgan told reporters on Friday. Trudeau won power in 2015 partly thanks to extra seats his Liberals won in British Columbia as well as increased support from environmentalists. Cracking down too hard would cost him support in both camps, leaving him with a weak minority government in the October 2019 elections. Long-standing tensions over the pipeline meant Liberals in British Columbia were already nervous about softening support before Kinder Morgan Canada’s ultimatum, said a Liberal party official. The Liberals also have to pick up seats in the province of Quebec, which has a strong green tradition. “It wouldn’t really take a lot to tip the government into minority territory,” said pollster Nik Nanos of Nanos Research. “If you’re looking at hard political calculus, the prime minister realistically has to tilt in favor of the environment because if he doesn’t that will kill him in Quebec.” During Sunday’s meeting, Trudeau will lay out the various financial, regulatory and legal options, said the second government source. “It’s not a matter of getting angry, or being mean or nice about it - he will lay out the facts,” said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The federal and Alberta governments both say they could take a stake in the pipeline to keep the project alive, with Alberta’s premier saying her province could even buy it outright. Kinder Morgan Canada has said it was open to discussions but did not elaborate. The first government source there was a “huge gray zone” of possible government help, citing the past bailout of the auto industry in 2009, federal loan guarantees for a hydro-electric project and Ottawa’s investment in an offshore energy project. Toronto-Dominion Bank Deputy Chairman Frank McKenna, a member of Alberta’s pipeline advisory taskforce, said he raised the issue with Trudeau in a recent call and that Ottawa has to “provide deal certainty ... a backstop”. “That could be something in the nature of an indemnity agreement or a guarantee against potential losses that would come from political instability and not based on normal construction risk,” said McKenna, a former premier of New Brunswick. TD Bank is Kinder Morgan Canada’s biggest lender. “At the end of the day this pipeline can’t be allowed to fail, it would be a huge blow to the leadership of the country and to the image of the country.” (With additional reporting by Matt Scuffham in Toronto, Julie Gordon in Vancouver;)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/kinder-morgan-cn-pipeline-surprise/rpt-canadas-trudeau-faces-election-risk-after-firms-pipeline-surprise-idUKL1N1RR0HX,16 Apr 2018,"Canada's government got just 24

2018-04-16,"JERUSALEM, April 16 (Reuters) - Israel’s Together has agreed to sell 5 tonnes of cannabis oil to an unnamed Canadian company that will potentially bring revenue of hundreds of millions of shekels. The Canadian company will buy from Together subsidiary Globus Pharma 50 tonnes of dried inflorescences of cannabis each year, which is equivalent to five tonnes of medical cannabis oil. The two companies will also collaborate in the field of research and development and promoting technologies in the medical cannabis sector. They have estimated sales will amount to $3.17 to $4.7 per gram of inflorescence. Investors have piled into cannabis stocks, such as Canadian producers Aurora and Canopy Growth, as many countries consider legalizing marijuana at least for medicinal purposes, such as a treatment for chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder, side effects from cancer therapy and other ailments. Canada approved medical pot in 2001 and will legalize recreational use by July. The parties intend to draw up a detailed agreement as soon as possible, which will fix the price of the sale of the various cannabis products according to prices on the Canadian market at the time of signing, the company said in a statement. Globus plans to provide the Canadian company with medical cannabis from farms in Israel subject to receiving an export permit for medical cannabis, or from its farm in an overseas country, which has an export agreement with Canada. The Canadian company is currently applying for a license to market and sell medical cannabis products in Canada and abroad and according to the information given to Globus, it expects to receive the license within four to five months.

2018-04-16,"OSLO, April 16 (Reuters) - The global aluminium market risks facing supply shortages over U.S. sanctions against Russia as well as Norsk Hydro’s production cutbacks in Brazil, Hydro’s chief executive told Reuters on Monday. Industries ranging from automakers to soda-can producers worry over deliveries and sharp price hikes, Svein Richard Brandtzaeg said in an interview. During the weekend, Hydro carried out a 50-percent output reduction at Brazil’s Albras aluminium plant as previously warned, triggered by an unresolved dispute at its nearby Alunorte alumina refinery, which supplies the key raw material. Aluminium prices hit six-year highs on the London Metal Exchange on Monday, continuing a spike that began when the United States imposed sanctions on UC Rusal, the world’s second-biggest producer, as well as Hydro’s own cuts. “There is a shortage of alumina, and there will also be a shortage of aluminium unless Rusal can find new markets quite quickly,” Brandtzaeg said at Hydro’s headquarters in Oslo.

European shares were broadly flat, however, adding to a mixed picture in Asian stock markets and suggesting that a degree of caution prevails. While last week’s bid for investment safety in top-rated government bonds unwound, other traditional havens in times of global political tension held firmer. Gold prices were little changed, while Japan’s yen and the Swiss franc were higher than levels late on Friday. “There is some relief that a direct confrontation between the U.S. and Russia over Syria has been avoided,” said DZ Bank rate strategist Daniel Lenz after Russian President Vladimir Putin warned on Sunday that further Western attacks in Syria would bring chaos to world affairs. Saturday’s strikes marked the biggest intervention by Western countries against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his ally Russia, which is facing further economic sanctions over its role in the conflict. The United States, Britain and France said the missile strikes targeted Syria’s chemical weapons capabilities and were not aimed at toppling Assad or intervening in the civil war. U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted “mission accomplished” after the attack, underlining expectations that Western action would be limited. However, while President Putin warned on the potential impact on world affairs if there were further Western strikes on Syria, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said the United States would announce new economic sanctions on Monday aimed at companies “dealing with equipment” related to Syria’s alleged chemical weapons use. European and U.S. government bond yields — which move inversely to prices — rose across the board. That was partly as attention turned to what is expected to be a robust first-quarter U.S. corporate earnings season, which begins in earnest this week. The yield on both German and U.S. 10-year government bonds, seen as among the most liquid and safe assets in the world, were at their highest levels in three weeks. Oil prices, meanwhile, dropped sharply. Brent crude shed more than 1.5 percent to $71.45 a barrel, with a rise in U.S. drilling for new production also dragging on prices. MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was flat on the day and a pan-European stock index was marginally lower. U.S. stock futures were pointing to a higher opening on Wall Street. First quarter earnings for U.S. companies will be very important after February’s sell-off, said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. “If there is a genuine dent in earnings, people will sit up and take notice,” he said, adding that regulation will be a powerful driver for the technology sector, citing the example of Facebook, as well as the banking industry. The dollar failed to hold its early gains on the yen and eased to 107.20, though that was still up on last week’s low around 106.62. Dealers were keeping a wary eye on Japanese politics after a survey showed support for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had fallen to 26.7 percent, the lowest since he took office in late 2012. Abe’s sliding ratings are raising doubts about whether he can win a third three-year term as ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leader in a September vote, or if he might even resign before the party election. “For markets, the question is whether this matters for economic policy,” said Paul Donovan, global chief economist at UBS Wealth Management. “A change in leadership may matter if the next prime minister has a radically different agenda.” Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.3 percent while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.4 percent as Chinese blue-chips skidded 1.7 percent.

Bakhit al-Rashidi also said the meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in June in Vienna would offer a chance to review the deal, adding that oil markets were heading in the right direction for stability. “The agreement will continue until the end of this year,” the minister told reporters at an oil industry event in Kuwait. He added that “it would depend on market conditions whether to extend this agreement beyond 2018 or to reach a permanent agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC to support market stability”, saying this issue would be reviewed later in the year. An initial draft of a longer-term alliance agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers would be discussed at the June meeting, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said last week. OPEC, Russia and several other non-OPEC producers began to cut supply in January 2017 in an effort to lift oil prices. The pact runs until the end of this year, and the June meeting will see participants decide their next course of action. A surplus in global oil inventories was close to evaporating, OPEC said last week, citing healthy energy demand and its own supply cuts. It also revised up its forecast for output from rivals that have benefited from higher oil prices. OPEC has a self-imposed goal of bringing oil inventories in industrialised countries down to their five-year average. Barkindo said in Kuwait on Monday that oil stocks in the developed world fell in February to below 50 million barrels above the latest five-year average and that the declining trend would continue over the coming months.

2018-04-16,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian rouble and shares in some of Russia’s biggest companies slid lower on Monday, dragged down by the threat of new U.S. sanctions and lower oil prices.  Volatility on the Russian market has soared since Washington imposed fresh sanctions against Moscow on April 6, targeting major Russian companies and some of the country’s most prominent businessmen. Dangers of a direct military confrontation between Russia and the United States eased over the weekend after Western missiles fired at Syria over a suspected poison gas attack steered clear of any Russian troops on the ground. But Washington said on Sunday it would impose further sanctions against Russia on Monday over Moscow’s support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.      At 0740 GMT, the rouble was 0.36 percent weaker against the dollar at 62.27 RUBUTSTN=MCX and had lost 0.37 percent to trade at 76.80 versus the euro EURRUBTN=MCX. Russia's dollar-denominated RTS index .IRTS was down 0.57 percent to 1,098.26 points, while the rouble-based MOEX Russian index .IMOEX was 0.18 percent lower at 2,171.28 points. Shares in aluminium giant Rusal, which was placed on the April 6 U.S. sanctions list, were down more than 5 percent on the Moscow Exchange (RUAL.MM) after falling 30 percent in Hong Kong. “Fears of a direct military conflict between the U.S. and Russia have been sidelined, allowing markets to breathe easier, but only somewhat,” BCS analysts said in a note. “Sentiment, still, will be tempered awaiting the Kremlin’s response to the U.S.-led strike in Syria, to U.S. sanctions of last week and potential new sanctions.” Lower prices for oil, Russia’s main export, also weighed on Russian assets.

2018-04-16,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan and China agree that a trade war will have serious consequences for the world economy, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said on Monday after a high-level economic dialogue between the world’s third- and second-largest economies.  Concern is growing about a trade row between China and the United States in which the two nations have threatened each other with tariffs. Japan has been criticised by U.S. President Donald Trump on trade and been hit with tariffs on steel and aluminium, but it has not yet threatened counter-tariffs. “We have shared understanding that a trade war, no matter which country has brought it about, would have a very large impact on the prosperity of the international economy,” Kono told reporters after the first such dialogue in more than seven years.     Kono and the Chinese government’s top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, co-chaired the Tokyo meeting. Wang is also foreign minister. Financial markets have been roiled recently over fears that a full-blown U.S.-China trade war could shatter global trade and economic growth. Trade issues will likely be at the forefront of a summit between Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Trump later this week. Tokyo is eager to avoid being pushed into talks on a two-way free trade agreement aimed not only at market access but at monetary and currency policies.   Kono also said it was possible that Japan works with China on Beijing’s Belt and Road projects. “It is quite possible that Japan cooperates with China on various (Belt and Road) projects on a case by case basis where international standards are met,” Kono said. Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative, unveiled in 2013, aims at building a modern-day Silk Road connecting China by land and sea to Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.  Abe and Xi pledged last year to reset the sometimes touchy relationship between Asia’s two largest economic powers.   Wang, who spent eight years in Japan as a diplomat including three as ambassador, said the changing economic climate presented fresh opportunities. “After reopening these talks, we’re both standing at new starting points to discuss future cooperation that will, I hope, lead to fresh economic growth for both nations,” Wang said at the start of the economic dialogue. Wang is the first Chinese foreign minister to visit Japan in a bilateral context in nine years. He and Kono discussed a broad range of issues, including North Korea, on Sunday night.

2018-04-16,"(Repeats from Friday; no changes to text) By Giancarlo Navach MILAN, April 13 (Reuters) - Italian energy group Eni is considering stepping up its investment in nuclear fusion, potentially doubling down on a technology considered so uncertain that Eni remains the only global oil company prepared to place a bet on it. Eni and bigger rivals such as Shell and BP have been looking at moving into renewable energy as climate change, the falling cost of solar and wind power and a shift to electric vehicles raise doubts over long-term demand for oil. Eni last month committed 50 million euros ($62 million) to one of several projects aiming to produce energy by fusing atoms at temperatures as hot as the sun, a process seen by doubters as still closer to science fiction than commercial reality. After the move, Eni’s head of development operations and technology, Roberto Casula, said it might raise its investment in Commonwealth Fusion System, a firm created by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which is developing the project. “After the transition to renewable energy, the real breakthrough technologically is nuclear fusion,” Casula said, adding the process involved recreating the physics of the sun, producing heat but no emissions and very limited nuclear waste. Casula estimates it will cost $3 billion to develop a 200-megawatt fusion reactor by 2033 and says Commonwealth Fusion System is looking to raise more funds and to draw up an overall investment agreement with a range of financiers. Casula and MIT declined to give the size of Eni’s current stake, and the Eni executive could not say at this stage how much it would be ready to invest. He said Eni had signed a deal giving it the right to use the project’s intellectual property. “The eventual stake we’ll have in the company will be decided when there is an overall investment agreement, depending also on how much they will raise,” Casula said. The MIT project is vying with research teams in France, China and Britain to develop a reactor that can generate more energy than the enormous amount that fusion consumes, and can also safely contain a mass of super-hot gases or plasma. Italy also recently entered the race, though Eni is sticking with MIT, saying the Boston project is unique in its aim to produce electricity, while others have scientific objectives. All projects are based on a system known as tokamak, which uses superconducting magnets to hold the plasma at temperatures of up to 100 million degrees, suspending it inside a vacuum chamber without it touching the chamber’s walls. To make electricity, heat produced by the fusion of hydrogen isotopes is used to spin steam turbines in the conventional way. The France-based ITER project is the largest endeavour, with a budget of around 20 billion euros. A collaboration between Europe, the United States, China, India, Japan, Russia and South Korea, it is more than halfway towards the first test of its super-heated plasma by 2025 and first full-power fusion by 2035. Unlike the MIT project, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) team does not plan to generate electricity, saying this will be further in the future, and is being supported by governments rather than the private sector. “Based on our experience with the ITER project, we feel the MIT timeline to a power plant in 15 years is very ambitious, if not overly ambitious,” ITER chief scientist Tim Luce said. “But if they succeed, we will celebrate their success.” ITER director Bernard Bigot said nuclear fusion research and development were being driven mainly by governments, likening it to the early days of space technology and suggesting the time had yet to arrive when private investors would take the lead. “In fusion research we are only about in the 1960s, before anybody got to the moon,” Bigot said. MIT and Eni are more optimistic. The Boston-based team, which has built a bedroom-sized experimental tokamak reactor, plans to develop a larger-scale system of superconducting magnets within three years and build a fusion reactor within eight before finally, within 15 years, completing a nuclear-fusion power plant generating electricity. “Our goal is to do things even faster than that because it is a unique opportunity right now and with climate change we should be aggressive and ambitious,” said Bob Mumgaard, chief executive of MIT project company Commonwealth Fusion System. He said the MIT and ITER projects differed mainly in their magnet technologies, and that MIT’s system enabled it to contain plasma in a smaller chamber. “In fusion devices the magnetic field is very important and this will allow us to build a device which is one sixtieth the volume of ITER,” Mumgaard said, adding that MIT’s final-stage reactor would be the size of a basketball court. Though research into nuclear fusion dates to the 1950s, some scientists doubt the technology can become a commercial energy source within MIT’s 15-year timeframe. “The ability to make these components work in the desired way in the presence of such intense fields of irradiation ... is a very big challenge,” said Matteo Passoni, a nuclear engineer and expert on plasma physics at Milan’s Polytechnic University. For Eni, though, its investment in fusion represents a modest bet on a potentially big discovery, a familiar equation to its upstream division when it explores for oil and gas. “Arriving within 15-16 years at a commercial reactor is exactly the timeframe we use in upstream,” Casula said.

EMini futures for the S&P 500 rose right from the start and were last up 0.4 percent, while Eurostoxx 50 futures added 0.27 percent. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.3 percent. Yet MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.4 percent as Chinese blue chips skidded 1.7 percent. Real estate and financial firms led the declines as Chinese authorities continue to tighten the screws on riskier types of financing in a bid to reduce systemic risks. The early mood had been one of relief that the well-telegraphed attack on Syria had been limited in scale. The United States, France and Britain launched 105 missiles targeting what the Pentagon said were three chemical weapons facilities in Syria in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack in Douma on April 7. Russian President Vladimir Putin warned on Sunday that further Western attacks on Syria would bring chaos to world affairs, as Washington prepared to increase pressure on Russia with new economic sanctions. But with President Donald Trump declaring mission accomplished, investors assumed the worst had been avoided. “Trump was able to enforce his chemical weapons red line without crossing the threshold for Russian retaliation,” analysts at JPMorgan said in a note. “Stocks were concerned about a prolonged and expanded U.S. campaign towards Assad and that doesn’t look probable.” Safe-haven assets eased slightly in response, with yields on U.S. 10-year Treasury debt up two basis points at 2.84 percent. The dollar failed to hold its early gains on the yen and eased to 107.20, though that was still up on last week’s low around 106.62. Dealers were keeping a wary eye on Japanese politics after a survey showed support for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had fallen to 26.7 percent, the lowest since he took office in late 2012.

2018-04-16,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe could find his oft-touted close ties with Donald Trump sorely tested at a summit this week in which Tokyo fears the U.S. leader will to try to link vital security matters with touchy trade topics. It is a fraught time for both sides, and comes as Trump prepares to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whose government has been openly antagonistic toward Japan.  Abe is struggling with declining popularity because of suspected cronyism scandals. Trump, whose White House is grappling with scandals and investigations of its own, may be hunting for a political win ahead of November midterm congressional elections. Japan wants Trump to avoid a deal in which Pyongyang gives up ballistic missiles that can hit the U.S. mainland but keeps shorter-range missiles that threaten Japan. Abe also wants Trump to bring up Japanese citizens kidnapped by Pyongyang long ago. At the summit with Trump on Tuesday and Wednesday, Tokyo is equally eager to avoid being pushed into talks on a two-way free trade agreement aimed not only at market access but at monetary and currency policies. “If Abe brings up abductions and short and mid-range missiles, it’s obvious that Trump will say, ‘OK, do something on the economic side,’” said a Japanese ruling party lawmaker well-versed in U.S.-Japan ties, who declined to be identified because the topic and timing are sensitive. Trump’s ability to give allies policy whiplash was on display last week when he said he’d asked aides to re-open talks on the multinational Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) that he abandoned last year. Afterward, he tweeted that the United States would only rejoin if offered “substantially better” terms and urged a bilateral deal with Japan, which “has hit us hard on trade for years!” Eleven remaining members, led by Japan, signed a TPP-11 agreement in March. Tokyo has long hoped Washington would return to TPP but is opposed to any major makeover of the pact to help that happen.  “What Trump wants most is a ‘success story,’ and that means bringing Japan into bilateral economic talks,” the lawmaker said. Trump’s decision to include Japan as a target for tariffs on its steel exports while exempting several other countries was widely seen as pressure on Japan to agree to a free-trade deal. Japan will propose a new framework to discuss trade issues with Washington as a way to coax it back to TPP, the Nikkei business daily said on Saturday. Ongoing talks led by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso have produced few results. But such a proposal would face headwinds if Trump insists on renegotiating the TPP or tries to push Tokyo into a two-way pact. “TPP achieved the impossible … if they want to rebalance or change, it is very delicate and I don’t see a realistic possibility of going further in any way,” said a Japanese government source who also declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the topic. Abe, who was the first foreign leader to meet Trump after his election and has since held two summits - both of which included chummy rounds of golf - sought this week’s meeting after Trump stunned Tokyo with his willingness meet Kim Jong Un. A senior U.S. administration official told reporters in Washington that the two countries were cooperating from the top down. “We manage frictions as they come. And I think, overall, the relationship has never been better,” the official said. Japanese officials fear the U.S. midterm elections this year and other domestic headaches are making Trump especially keen for success both in talks with North Korea and on the economic front, where he has threatened a trade war with China and pressed South Korea into revising a bilateral free-trade deal.  “The midterm elections are foremost in Trump’s mind,” Katsuyuki Kawai, a special ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) adviser for foreign affairs to Abe, told Reuters.  “This is precisely the time when allies must join together on security matters to face North Korea,” Kawai added. Abe may find the talks complicated by his efforts to improve ties with Russia and China - while being likely to join Trump in criticising some of Beijing’s trade practices. Abe is expected to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in May to seek progress in a decades-old territorial dispute. On Saturday, Abe expressed support for the “resolve” of the United States, Britain and France to halt chemical weapons use but only  “understanding” for their attacks on Syria, which Putin has denounced.  Given Trump’s propensity for deal-making, diplomatic experts advised Abe to steer clear of details at the summit. “We don’t want to turn the whole thing into bargaining between the United States and Japan,” said Narushige Michishita, a former defence official and now a professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies.

2018-04-16,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - The Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries (CPOPC), a palm oil board led by Indonesia and Malaysia, said British supermarket chain Iceland’s decision to remove palm oil from its own-brand food products misleads consumers.  Iceland said last week that due to concerns over rainforest destruction it would remove palm oil from all of its own-brand products by end-2018, reducing demand for the vegetable oil by more than 500 tonnes per year.  The claims being made against palm oil are “misleading the consumers on the environmental benefits of other vegetable oil,” CPOPC Executive Director Mahendra Siregar said in a letter addressed to Richard Walker, managing director of Iceland.  Siregar confirmed the content of the letter, dated April 13, late on Sunday.  CPOPC said demand for vegetable oil continues to grow and that replacing palm oil with other vegetable oils, such as from rapeseed, soybeans and sunflower seeds, would lead to 10 to 20 times greater land use to produce the same amount of oil.  Iceland, which specializes in frozen food and operates around 900 stores, said it has already removed palm oil from half of its own-brand products.  A demand boom for widely-used palm oil has led to palm plantations spread across 18 million hectares in Indonesia and Malaysia, according to data from Indonesian government and Malaysia Palm Oil Board. Indonesia and Malaysia are the world’s largest and second-largest producers of palm oil.  Critics say the expansion has resulted in an increase in the greenhouse gases that warm the planet.  Palm plantation are also often blamed for forest fires that regularly take place on Sumatra and Kalimantan in Indonesia, blanketing large areas of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore in a choking haze that can hang in the air for weeks. The European Parliament last year voted to phase out use of unsustainable palm oil in biodiesel by 2020. The resolution endorsed a single Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (CSPO) plan for Europe-bound palm and other vegetable oils to ensure they are produced in an environmentally sustainable way.  Europe is the second-largest market for both Indonesia and Malaysia. India is the largest.  Indonesia has been promoting palm oil in new markets to mitigate the risk of dropping European demand, while promoting wider use of biodiesel locally to soak up supply.

2018-04-16,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Total profit from China’s central government-owned firms accelerated in the first quarter while debt levels fell from the beginning of the year, suggesting Beijing is having some success with revamping its debt-ridden and lumbering state sector.  Profit in the first quarter rose 20.9 percent from a year earlier to 377.06 billion yuan ($60.03 billion), up from 15.2 percent for 2017 - the highest in five years, the country’s state assets regulator said on Monday.  For March, profit rose 17.8 percent from a year earlier to 169.87 billion yuan, the highest for a month on record, spokesman Peng Huagang told a news briefing.  The strong profit numbers could give Beijing leeway to push forward corporate deleveraging reforms as it aims to make state-owned enterprises (SOEs) more profitable and responsive to the market. Indeed, the average debt-to-assets ratio was at 65.9 percent at end-March, 0.4 percentage point lower compared with the beginning of this year, Peng said. SASAC said in January that China would cut the debt-to-asset ratio of central government-run enterprises’ by another 2 percentage points by the end of 2020. The regulator encourages centrally-owned firms to list their traditional assets or introduce private capital into their traditional businesses and invest the money raised to forward-looking and strategic industries, Peng said.  SASAC will also increase efforts to clean up non-performing assets and strictly control high-risk businesses, including  monitoring firms’ debt investments and their global businesses, Peng added.  Overseas investments by centrally-owned SOEs account for 60 percent of China’s non-financial outbound investments, Peng said. China has already cut the number of enterprises administered by the central government to 98 from 117 in 2012 through a series of high-profile mergers and acquisitions. The regulator will complete coal overcapacity cuts and firmly deal with “zombie firms,” Peng said.  He added that centrally-owned firms have cut 16 million tonnes of steel capacity and 62 million tonnes of coal capacity so far.

2018-04-16,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German automotive industry must invest heavily in electric car technology and develop battery production facilities in Europe to keep up with global competitors, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said in a newspaper interview published on Monday. Altmaier told Germany’s mass-circulation Bild newspaper that the carmakers needed to invest high “two-digit billion amounts” in electric car technology, saying he did not understand why the firms had hesitated for so long. Investments were also needed in battery production, given expected demand for many millions of electric batteries that could help firms earn good money, he said. “Otherwise we’ll have to accept that a large part of the added value will be produced in Asia or the United States, instead of here with us,” he said. The German car industry, which accounts for some 800,000 jobs in Europe’s biggest economy, is struggling with a global backlash against diesel cars after Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in 2015 that it had cheated U.S. exhaust tests. To help reduce pollution levels and avoid a total ban on diesel vehicles, VW, Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and others have stepped up development of electric cars. The new German coalition government plans to ease the tax burden on drivers of electric vehicles, provide at least an additional 100,000 charge points across the country and subsidise car-sharing to push a shift to greener transportation. There are also plans to provide funding for research into autonomous driving technology and support the establishment of battery cell production in Germany.  Altmaier said German carmakers needed to develop a model that had at least the range of a Tesla (TSLA.O) but costs less, and should work on developing an information technology platform for self-driving cars that was the best in the world. “The first safe self-driving cars must operate with German technology,” he said. German companies should also work with other European firms to develop a European battery cell production. The conservative minister said it was imperative to secure the hundreds of thousands of jobs now supporting the car and supplier industries.

2018-04-16,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: Trends in China's trade, economy: tmsnrt.rs/2iO9Q6a By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, April 16 (Reuters) - China’s imports of major commodities may be losing some of their strong growth momentum, with gains in the first quarter of this year failing to keep pace with those from the same period in 2017. At first glance, China’s imports of crude oil, iron ore, coal and copper looked to have bounced back in March after a poor showing in February. However, the first two months of the year generally result in some distortions in the data, depending on the timing of the Lunar New Year. This year’s holiday fell entirely within February, resulting in weaker import numbers. It’s always more illuminating to look at first quarter numbers when assessing China’s commodity imports, and here the story is far more mixed. Crude oil imports rose 7 percent in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period a year earlier to the equivalent of about 9.1 million barrels per day (bpd). However, the growth rate in the first quarter of 2017 was 15 percent, meaning that although China’s imports of crude oil are still increasing, they aren’t doing so at the same pace as they did in the early part of last year. In volume terms, the gain still looks impressive, with imports in the first quarter some 600,000 bpd more than they were in the same period in 2017. However, it’s also worth noting that exports of refined fuels were about 1.27 million bpd, which is about 210,000 bpd more than they were in the first quarter of last year. This implies that of the additional 600,000 bpd of crude imported in the first quarter of 2018, just over a third was exported as refined products, a further factor pointing to the loss of some growth momentum in China’s crude demand. Coal imports also looked to have rebounded strongly in March, with a 27.8 percent jump over the previous month, but the gain for the first quarter as a whole was a more modest 16.6 percent. This growth rate is still robust, but it is about half the pace of what was achieved in the first quarter of 2017. The story is even weaker for iron ore, with first quarter imports of 270.5 million tonnes actually being 0.1 percent down from the same quarter last year. In the January-March period last year, iron ore imports were up 12.2 percent from the same period in 2016. It would appear that China’s vast steel sector may be taking a breather after several months of strong gains, and the build-up of iron ore inventories at ports to record levels in recent weeks probably has helped lower the appetite for imports. However, copper is an area of strength in China’s first quarter, with imports of unwrought copper increasing 7.3 percent in the first quarter, a reversal of the decline of 20 percent experienced in the first three months of 2017. However, it’s likely that some of this gain is due to a change in regulations, making it more difficult to import copper scrap and thereby boosting demand for the refined metal. Overall, the picture that emerges from China’s first quarter trade data is somewhat similar to an Australian government public information campaign on terrorism, which urged citizens to “be alert, not alarmed”. There is little to suggest that China’s economy is slowing faster than expected, and the data show that commodity imports are still relatively robust, even if the pace of growth is slowing. It’s likely that a healthy moderation is the best outcome for China, just so long as it doesn’t turn into something more pronounced in the current quarter.

2018-04-16,"TOKYO, April 16 (Reuters) - Japanese Foreign Affairs Minister Taro Kono and his Chinese counterpart kicked off the first high-level economic talks between their nations in eight years on Monday, at a time of tense trade relations with the United States for both countries. Concern is growing about a trade row between China and the United States in which the two nations have threatened each other with tariffs. Japan has come in for criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump on trade and been hit with tariffs on steel and aluminium, but Japan has not yet threatened counter-tariffs. China’s top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, is the first Chinese foreign minister to visit Japan in a bilateral context in nine years. He and Kono discussed a broad range of issues, including North Korea, Kono on Sunday night. “In these eight years, both nations as well as the economic conditions surrounding them have changed greatly, even as our regional economic roles have increased,” Kono said at the start of Monday’s discussions, noting a need for a reset of their often-fraught bilateral ties. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged last year to reset the sometimes touchy relationship between Asia’s two largest economic powers. “I hope that today we can discuss closer, tighter economic cooperation as well as the regional and global economic situations,” Kono added. Wang, who spent eight years in Japan as a diplomat including three as ambassador, said the changing economic climate presented fresh opportunities. “After reopening these talks we’re both standing at new starting points to discuss future cooperation that will, I hope, lead to fresh economic growth for both nations,” Wang said. Financial markets have been roiled recently over fears that a full-blown U.S.-China trade war could shatter global trade and economic growth, and these issues are likely to be high on the agenda, along with Japanese cooperation on China’s Belt and Road projects. Japanese officials are also eager to avoid trade friction with the United States, with the issue to be discussed in the Abe and Trump talks later this week.

The United States, France and Britain launched 105 missiles on Saturday, targeting what they said were three chemical weapons facilities in Syria in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack in Douma on April 7. Brent crude oil futures were at $71.87 per barrel at 0124 GMT, down 71 cents, or 1 percent from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 59 cents, or 0.9 percent, at $66.80 a barrel. Traders said markets in Asia began cautiously after the weekend stikes, while oil markets also came under pressure from a rise in U.S. oil drilling activity. U.S. energy companies added seven oil rigs drilling for new production in the week to April 13, bringing the total to 815, the highest since March 2015, energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday. Despite this, Brent is still up more than 16 percent from its 2018 low in February, due to healthy demand and also because of conflict and tension in the Middle East. Although Syria itself is not a significant oil producer itself, the wider Middle East is the world’s most important crude exporter and tension in the region tends to put oil markets on edge. “Investors continued to worry about the impact of a wider conflict in the Middle East,” ANZ bank said.
