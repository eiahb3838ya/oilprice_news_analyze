2018-09-08,"(Adding official data for August) BEIJING, Sept 8 (Reuters) - China’s imports of steelmaking raw material iron ore fell slightly in August from the previous month, according to customs data on Saturday, hit by output curbs on steel mills as the government battles pollution. Arrivals totalled 89.35 million tonnes last month, down 0.7 percent from 89.96 million tonnes in July, according to data from the General Administration of Customs. That compares with 88.66 million tonnes in August last year. The data showed that in the year to date, imports hit 710 million tonnes, down 0.5 percent. “Steel mills reduced their replenishing demand for raw materials due to continued anti-pollution measures and environmental inspections,” Zhuo Guiqiu, an analyst at Jinrui Futures, said before the data was released. Utilisation rates at blast furnaces at steel mills across China fell to 66.16 percent in mid-August, the lowest level since early April, data from the Mysteel consultancy showed. The country’s main steelmaking hub, Tangshan city, said this week it would continue to carry out production restrictions in September. That comes after mills there were ordered to cut output capacity by as much as 50 percent over a six-week period from July 20 to Aug. 30. Meanwhile, teams of inspectors have been sent by the central government to the provinces of Shanxi and Shaanxi to check environmental issues from Aug. 20 to Nov. 11, which could crimp production activity in the region. Zhuo expects iron ore demand to be focused on high-grade fines and pellets, with mills looking to boost production efficiency. Average profit margins at Chinese steel mills remain at about 1,000 yuan ($146.30) a tonne, just below record levels seen in November last year, according to Huatai Futures.

2018-09-08,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s crude oil imports rose 6.5 percent in August from a month earlier to their highest since May, boosted by a rebound in demand from smaller, independent refiners, customs data showed on Saturday. Arrivals last month were 38.38 million tonnes, or 9.04 million barrels per day (bpd), according to the General Administration of Customs. This was up from 8.0 million bpd a year ago and 8.48 million in July and just slightly lower than the forecast of 9.12 million bpd from Thomson Reuters Oil Research.         For the first eight months of the year, crude purchases stood at 299 million tonnes, up 6.5 percent, the data showed. Independent refiners, known as teapots, wound back their crude buying earlier this year, shutting or suspending operations due to a combination of sinking diesel demand, higher crude prices and new tax rules. However, a recent rise in fuel prices and improved margins have led to an in increase in crude processing, with many now returning from summer maintenance to gear up for rising winter demand. Teapot buying in August rose to 6 million tonnes, or 1.4 million bpd, up 40 percent from July, and September arrivals are expected to breach 7 million tonnes, data from Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodities Research showed.

2018-09-08,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Power had been restored to almost all customers in the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido by early Saturday, two days after an earthquake caused an island-wide blackout and killed at least 21 people. But the impact of Thursday’s 6.7 magnitude quake was set to rumble on with Toyota Motor planning to halt operations at 16 of 18 domestic full-assembly plants due to a parts factory shutdown. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the confirmed death toll was 21, with six people in cardiopulmonary arrest - a term used in Japan to describe a victim’s condition before death is officially confirmed - and 13 people were missing. The earthquake triggered landslides that buried houses and paralyzed Hokkaido with widespread power and transport cuts, the latest natural disaster to hit Japan after typhoons, floods and deadly heat waves in the past two months. Toyota Motor said it would suspend work at the 16 plants on Monday due to the shutdown of its transmission factory in Tomakomai in Hokkaido following the quake.  The company said it would decide later on whether to extend the shutdowns beyond Monday. Suga called on businesses and Hokkaido’s 5.3 million residents to save power by about 10 percent from Monday, when usage rises, and said the government would likely resort to rolling blackouts if demand threatened to exceed supply capacity.    That would be the first use of rolling blackouts in Japan to deal with power shortages since March 2011, when a magnitude 9 earthquake and tsunami caused the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Hokkaido Electric said power supplies had been restored island-wide to 2.93 million customers by early Saturday, leaving only 20,000 customers without electricity. The utility will have supplies of up to 3.6 GW available by the end of Saturday, the trade ministry said, which is still short of pre-quake peak demand of 3.8 GW. Japanese refiner Idemitsu Kosan Co is preparing to resume truck product shipments at its 150,000 barrels-per-day Hokkaido refinery, a company official said.  Refining operations have been halted since Thursday.

2018-09-08,"(Adds background on Pemex and details of plan to increase production) VILLAHERMOSA, Mexico, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Saturday that crude production in the country is expected to reach at least 2.6 million barrels per day (bpd) by the end of his administration, up from current levels of 1.8 million bpd. Lopez Obrador added that new tenders for drilling oil wells announced this week will take place on state oil firm Pemex’s fields and shallow waters. “The public investment will be dedicated to extracting petroleum in Pemex’s territory,” he said. “Those platforms that are not being occupied will have work again.” Lopez Obrador said earlier this week that the tenders will begin in   December but did not provide further details. To boost production, Pemex will need to strike agreements with companies it has traditionally partnered with to begin drilling or tap existing wells, said Lopez Obrador. Pemex’s production has hit its lowest level in decades, with its six refineries operating at just 40 percent capacity, increasing the need for fuel imports. Lopez Obrador, who takes office in December, has long criticized the outgoing government’s move to open the oil industry to private capital.   The leftist has vowed to strengthen state oil company Petróleos Mexicanos PEMX.UL, known as Pemex, and refine more crude in Mexico.

2018-09-08,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A working group of German government officials and car industry lobbyists has recommended hardware retrofits for older diesel vehicles as a way to avert inner-city bans, Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported. A sub-committee of experts of Germany’s National Diesel Forum will back so-called selective catalytic reduction hardware refits to cut nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, the newspaper said in an excerpt of an article to be published on Sunday, made available to Reuters on Saturday. There is, however, no consensus on who will foot the bill for the retrofits, which can cost 3,000 euros or more per car, the paper said. It cited a government spokeswoman as reaffirming a plan for Chancellor Angela Merkel to decide on measures to cut NOx emissions this month.  A court ruled last week that Frankfurt, Germany’s financial center, must ban highly-polluting, older diesel vehicles from the city center from next February as part of a plan to improve air quality. The city of Hamburg this year voluntarily blocked older diesel models from using selected trunk roads. Other cities including Aachen, Duesseldorf and Stuttgart, home to Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and Porsche (VOWG_p.DE), are also considering bans. The debate over air quality has been stoked by reports of persistently high NOx emissions in Germany’s largest cities and by Volkswagen’s admission in 2015 to have rigged diesel emissions tests in the U.S. with the help of engine control devices.

2018-09-08,"ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump warned on Friday he was ready to slap tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports into the United States, threatening duties on another $267 billion (£206.7 billion) of goods on top of $200 billion in imports primed for levies in coming days. The moves would sharply escalate Trump’s trade war with Beijing over his demands for major changes in economic, trade and technology policy. China has threatened retaliation, which could include action against U.S. companies operating there. Hours after a public comment period closed on his $200 billion China tariff list, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he was “being strong on China because I have to be.” “The $200 billion we are talking about could take place very soon depending on what happens with them. To a certain extent it’s going to be up to China,” Trump said. “And I hate to say this, but behind that is another $267 billion ready to go on short notice if I want. That totally changes the equation.” Stock prices slipped after his comments, with the S&P 500 off 0.2 percent, while China’s off-shore trade yuan currency fell against the dollar. [MKTS/GLOB] There was no immediate reaction to Trump’s comments from the Chinese government, and the threat of more tariffs had not been reported by mainstream state-owned Chinese media as of Saturday evening. Trump has already imposed 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, mostly industrial machinery and intermediate electronics parts, including semiconductors. The $200 billion list, which includes some consumer products such as cameras and recording devices, luggage, handbags, tires and vacuum cleaners, would be subject to tariffs of 10 percent to 25 percent. Cell phones, the biggest U.S. import from China, have so far been spared, but would be engulfed if Trump activates the $267 billion tariff list. Trump’s threatened tariffs, now totalling $517 billion in Chinese goods, would exceed the $505 billion in goods imported from China last year. But 2018 imports from China through July were up nearly 9 percent over the same period of 2017, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Earlier on Friday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Bloomberg Television the administration would evaluate public comments before making decisions on the $200 billion tariff list. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office received nearly 6,000 comments and held seven days of public hearings on the proposed levies. Most comments were from companies seeking to remove products from the tariff list, arguing there were few, if any alternative sources and the duties would cause financial hardship. Comparatively few applauded the tariffs.  Major technology company Apple Inc said a “wide range” of its products would be hit by the tariffs, but not its iPhone. It said in a late submission that its AirPods headphones, some of Apple’s Beats headphones, and its new HomePod smart speaker would face levies, causing its shares to slip in late trading.  “Our concern with these tariffs is that the U.S. will be hardest hit, and that will result in lower U.S. growth and competitiveness and higher prices for U.S. consumers,” Apple said in the letter. Retailers had successfully kept high-profile consumer electronics such as cell phones and television sets off of previous tariff lists. But David French, top lobbyist for the National Retail Federation, whose members include Amazon.com , BJ’s Wholesale Club and Macy’s, said nearly every consumer good could be affected if Trump follows through on all threatened tariffs. “The Chinese aren’t paying these tariffs, American families are going to pay these tariffs. These are taxes and they’re going to find their way into the pocket book of folks around the country,” French said. Kudlow, who heads the National Economic Council, told CNBC the administration was still talking with China about trade issues but so far China had not met U.S. requests. The United States has demanded that China better protect American intellectual property, cut its U.S. trade surplus, allow U.S. companies greater access to its markets and roll back its high-technology industrial subsidy programs.   “We are still talking with China on a number of issues ... Those talks will continue to go on. We want lower (trade) barriers across the board,” Kudlow said. Specifically, Kudlow said, the United States was seeking “zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, zero subsidies, stop the IP theft, stop the technology transfer, allow Americans to own their own companies.” “Those have been our asks for many months and so far those asks have not been satisfied,” he said. “However, hope springs eternal.” Additional reporting by Susan Heavey, and by Elias Glenn and Xu Jing in Beijing; Writing by David Lawder and Lisa Lambert; Editing by Catherine Evans",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-china/update-7-trump-ups-ante-on-china-threatens-duties-on-nearly-all-its-imports-idUKL2N1VT0U5,08 Sep 2018,"U.S.

2018-09-08,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s trade surplus with the United States widened to a record in August even as the country’s export growth slowed slightly, an outcome that could push President Donald Trump to turn up the heat on Beijing in their cantankerous trade dispute. The politically sensitive surplus hit $31.05 billion in August, up from $28.09 billion in July, customs data showed on Saturday, surpassing the previous record set in June. Over the first eight months of the year, China’s surplus with its largest export market has risen nearly 15 percent, adding to tensions in the trade relationship between the world’s two largest economies.  China’s annual export growth in August moderated slightly to 9.8 percent, the data showed, the weakest rate since March but only slightly below recent trends. The number missed analysts’ forecasts that shipments from the world’s largest exporter would rise 10.1 percent, slowing only slightly from 12.2 percent in July.   Even with U.S. tariffs targeting $50 billion of Chinese exports in effect for their first full month in August, China’s exports to the United States still accelerated, growing 13.2 percent from a year earlier from 11.2 percent in July.  “There is still an impact from front-loading of exports, but the main reason (for still-solid export growth) is strong growth in the U.S. economy,” said Zhang Yi, an economist at Zhonghai Shengrong Capital Management. Zhang said the impact from U.S. tariffs on China’s exports would likely be limited over the next few months.  China’s imports from the United States grew only 2.7 percent in August, a slowdown from 11.1 percent in July.  The world’s largest trading nation got off to a strong start this year, but its economic outlook is being clouded by the rapidly escalating U.S. trade dispute and cooling domestic demand. Trump upped the ante on Friday, warning he was ready to slap tariffs on nearly all Chinese imports to the United States, threatening duties on another $267 billion of goods on top of $200 billion in imports primed for levies in coming days. Washington has long criticised China’s huge trade surplus with the United States and has demanded Beijing reduce it. Still, disagreements between the two major economic powers run deeper than just the trade balance and tensions remain over limits on U.S. firms’ access to Chinese markets, intellectual property protection, technology transfers and investment.  Imports, a key gauge of the strength of China’s domestic demand, grew 20 percent, beating forecasts. Analysts had expected growth of 18.7 percent, slowing from July’s surprisingly high 27.3 percent. That resulted in China posting a smaller overall trade surplus of $27.91 billion for the month. Analysts had expected the surplus would rise to $31.79 billion from $28.05 billion in July. The surplus with the United States was larger than China’s net surplus for the month, indicating China would be running a deficit if trade with the world’s largest economy was excluded. While no one predicted a sudden, sharp blow from U.S. tariffs, China’s official export data has been surprisingly resilient so far, with growth exceeding analysts’ expectations for five months in a row. Chinese officials acknowledged Chinese exporters have been rushing out shipments to beat new U.S. tariffs, buoying the headline growth readings, while some companies such as steel mills are diversifying and selling more products to other countries. Economists have noted that disruptions in supply chains are likely to be more company specific, and will take time to be reflected in broad economic data and corporate earnings reports. However, anecdotal evidence of mounting trade damage on both sides of the Pacific is on the rise. Official and private manufacturing surveys for China show global demand for Chinese goods is clearly on the wane, with export orders shrinking for months in a row.    “Risks have increased due to the negative impacts of China-U.S. trade friction. The impact on exports may gradually start to show up, with future export growth possible declining,” said Liu Xuezhi, an analyst with Bank of Communications. Policymakers have shifted their focus in recent months to improving credit conditions and shoring up business confidence.  Beijing is ramping up spending on infrastructure projects to spur domestic demand and the central bank is tamping down borrowing costs and leaning on commercial banks to continue lending to struggling firms hit by trade troubles. But such steps will take time to arrest the economy’s slide, and analysts expect the government to unveil more stimulus measures if business conditions continue to deteriorate.
