2018-05-23,"SAO PAULO, May 23 (Reuters) - Brazil’s state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA on Wednesday decided to cut the cost of diesel at its refineries by 10 percent and freeze prices for 15 days to give the government and truck drivers time to negotiate an end to a protest that has crippled the country’s transport logistics. Petrobras, as the company is known, said in a securities filing that after 15 days it would gradually resume a year-old policy of nearly daily price adjustments tracking global markets, adding that the freeze did not represent a change in that policy.

2018-05-23,"* Production unaffected at Raguba field despite protests -NOC * Protesters also call for shut down of Waha field * Unclear if Waha field still operating * Both fields in Marada region; protesters want better state services (Adds AGOCO lowers output) By Ayman al-Warfalli BENGHAZI, Libya, May 23 (Reuters) - Libya’s National Oil Corp on Wednesday cut oil production by about 120,000 barrels a day as its eastern subsidiary AGOCO faced power problems due to unusually hot weather, a company official said on Wednesday. AGOCO hopes to gradually resume production, which has fallen to 146,000 bpd, when the weather gets cooler, the official said by phone. Production has been halted at the Massala field and the Sarir field also has power problems, he said. Temperatures hit 49 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, he said. The historical daily average ranges from 15 to 24 degrees Celsius, according to Accuweather.com. The Raguba field further west had a “minor distribution delay” but production was unaffected despite threats from protesters, state oil firm NOC said in a statement. Protesters in the remote Marada region of eastern Libya have demanded that authorities urgently deal with grievances over the absence of government, a shortage of healthcare and other services. The nation has been in turmoil since the toppling of leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Libya, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has not released a production figure for months but industry sources had put it at one million bpd before the power cut hit AGOCO. Distribution from the 5,000-barrels-per-day (bpd) Raguba field to the port of Brega was halted on Tuesday, but production was uninterrupted and output was stored on-site, the NOC said. Oil production at Raguba is ongoing despite threats by local protesters to shut down the field, the statement said. “No technical or infrastructure damage to the field or wells was incurred.” In a potential escalation, the protesters said they had called on workers at a second oilfield, Waha, to halt output and ask for state support. It was unclear whether production at Waha had stopped. The NOC thanked local groups for their support in resolving the matter following a meeting with protesters. Production at Sirte Oil stands at about 61,000 bpd. A pipeline of the Waha oil company, an NOC joint venture with foreign firms, running through Marada feeds the Es Sider port. Waha pumps around 260,000 bpd, officials have said. Some youths had also protested Marada town’s lack of road links to other communities and demanded jobs, officials have said, a common grievance in Libya. Armed groups have twice blown up the pipeline near Marada since December as security in the remote eastern area is volatile.

2018-05-23,"SAO PAULO, May 23 (Reuters) - Brazil’s agriculture sector is one of the hardest hit by a hike in diesel prices that has provoked a nationwide trucker strike, according to an analysis from a leading university released on Wednesday. The University of Sao Paulo’s College of Agriculture (Esalq) said that as compared to early 2017, farmers are now paying up to 9.05 reais ($2.50) more per tonne to move grains from fields in Mato Grosso state to Latin America’s largest port at Santos. Brazil is a key global supplier of grains, meat, coffee and sugar — most of which reach ports by road. The Esalq study estimated that the cost to move agricultural goods in Brazil was about 120 billion reais last year, with transportation accounting for 87.5 percent of that figure. The diesel hike is a tremendous blow to the sector when the sheer volume of products is considered, Esalq wrote. For instance, Brazil is expected to sell about 73 million tonnes of soybeans in export markets this season, according to projections by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Transport lobby CNT, which estimates that 60 percent of Brazil’s cargo is moved by truckers, called for a revision of the pricing policy of Brazil’s state-controlled oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA. “Brazil’s diesel fuel is more expensive than in countries at a similar stage of development like Russia and Mexico,” CNT said in a Wednesday statement, adding that local prices are on average about 15 percent higher than in the United States. Diesel fuel prices at the pump rose between 13 percent and 15 percent in the key agricultural and industrial states of Mato Grosso, São Paulo and Paraná between January 2017 and May 2018, Esalq said in its study. The federal government and a group representing truck drivers met for talks Wednesday afternoon, but failed to make any progress on ending the protests snarling traffic nationwide . The impasse continued despite Petrobras on Wednesday lowering diesel prices for a second time this week. $1 = 3.6238 reais

2018-05-23,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock markets pared losses and the dollar cut gains on Wednesday after the release of minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s May 1-2 meeting amid heightened concerns that setbacks to U.S.-China trade talks would undermine world economic growth. U.S. President Donald Trump said trade discussions with China would need to be rerouted, saying the current track appeared “too hard to get done” and any agreement reached between the world’s two largest economies needed “a different structure.” The remarks came a day after Trump said he was not pleased with U.S.-China talks, reversing a rally pegged to the White House’s optimistic comments about the discussions over the weekend that led to a strong rally on Monday.   The sell-off was tempered, however, after the Fed released its meeting minutes, indicating interest rates would not be raised at a faster-than-expected pace. That tipped the Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 indexes to close slightly positive. “The stock market seems to have reacted positively to it,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. “Part of what’s driving that is the market was bracing for the meeting minutes to be a bit more hawkish than they are.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 52.4 points, or 0.21 percent, to 24,886.81, the S&P 500 gained 8.85 points, or 0.32 percent, to 2,733.29 and the Nasdaq Composite added 47.50 points, or 0.64 percent, to 7,425.96.     Broad risk aversion hurt the dollar against the Japanese yen. The Japanese currency strengthened 0.73 percent versus the greenback at 110.10 per dollar. But the greenback managed to rise to a six-month high against the euro on data indicating a slowdown in European business activity before paring gains after Wednesday’s Fed minutes release. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 1.16 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.31 percent. Another reason for the euro’s woes is Italy, where an incoming coalition government comprised of the two anti-establishment parties - the League and 5-Star - looks likely to implement big-spending policies.  That could add to the country’s big debt pile and cause Rome to clash with the European Union. Investors were also eyeing Turkey, whose central bank raised interest rates by 300 basis points in an emergency move to put a floor under the plunging lira currency. Turkey’s central bank, which had been scheduled to hold its next policy-setting meeting on June 7, said it had increased its top interest rate to 16.5 percent from 13.5 percent.  The lira has fallen about 20 percent so far this year to a series of record lows, but the currency reversed course after the central bank decision and was about 2 percent firmer on the day at 4.5717 to the dollar at 1637 GMT.  Still, the lira is “not out of the woods yet,” said Win Thin, global head of emerging market currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.  “The relief is unlikely to last, especially if emerging markets continue to be under pressure,” Thin said. “The (Turkish) central bank will see how markets react and it will be important how they react when Europe opens” on Thursday. Investors have sold off their lira holdings on concerns about loose monetary policy, particularly after recent comments by President Tayyip Erdogan, a self-described “enemy of interest rates.” That sell-off spurred a rally in U.S. Treasuries as concerns about the tumbling lira boosted demand for low-risk debt. In other trading, oil fell after an unexpected build in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories despite strong demand, and as traders weighed the possibility of an increase in OPEC crude output to cover any shortfalls in supply from Iran and Venezuela.  Brent crude futures slipped 23 cents to settle at $79.80 a barrel, while U.S. crude lost 36 cents to $71.84 a barrel.

2018-05-23,"LIMA (Reuters) - The government of Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra cancelled his predecessor’s decision to award five offshore oil contracts to London-based Tullow Oil PLC (TLW.L) shortly before resigning, citing insufficient consultations with coastal residents. The reversal, which was published in the official gazette on Wednesday, was a victory for fishermen and environmentalists who said that exploration and drilling would have put important fisheries and whale breeding grounds at risk. It was another setback for efforts to shore up slumping energy investments in Peru, a relatively small oil producer where past bidding rounds have failed to draw offers. Tullow, whose shares fell 5.2 percent in London on Wednesday, said it would consider “next steps.”    The contracts came under fire after Peruvians learned the disgraced former president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, had signed five decrees authorizing them just before stepping down in March over graft allegations. Despite Kuczynski’s approval, the contracts themselves were never signed, state energy promoter Perupetro said. Vizcarra’s government said Perupetro had negotiated the contracts directly with Tullow without giving communities along Peru’s northern coast enough time to weigh in. “We want a country that develops investments with peace and tranquility, and that’s done with a good start to a project,” Prime Minister Cesar Villanueva told a press conference. “With this repeal we are not even remotely opposed to private investment,” Villanueva added. Since taking office, Vizcarra, Kuzynski’s former vice president, has distanced himself from his predecessor as he aims to strengthen ties with the opposition-controlled Congress and build grassroots support following Peru’s worst political crisis in nearly two decades. The revocation of Kuczynski’s decrees “is deeply disappointing,” said George Cazenove, Tullow’s head of communications. “Tullow has complied with the process and procedures required under Peruvian law.”     Earlier this month, the comptroller’s office said it had found nothing illegal about the contracts, but that the process of granting oil concessions through direct talks should be more transparent and give other stakeholders more say. Critics said a public auction should have been held and a higher royalty rate should have been set. Tullow had planned an initial investment of $200 million (£149.8 million) in the five blocks, according to Perupetro. The National Society of Mining, Petroleum and Energy  business association said the government had only created more uncertainty for investors in Peru, where oil imports cost the country billions of dollars per year.

2018-05-23,"SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - China will import record volumes of U.S. oil and is likely to ship more U.S. soy after Beijing signalled to state-run refiners and grains purchasers they should buy more to help ease tensions between the two top economies, trade sources said on Wednesday. China pledged at the weekend to increase imports from its top trading partner to avert a trade war that could damage the global economy. Energy and commodities were high on Washington’s list of products for sale.  The United States is also seeking better access for imports of genetically modified crops into China under the deal. As the two sides stepped back from a full-blown trade war, Washington neared a deal on Tuesday to lift its ban on U.S. firms supplying Chinese telecoms gear maker ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) (0763.HK), and Beijing announced tariff cuts on car imports.  But U.S. President Donald Trump indicated on Wednesday that negotiations were still short of his objectives when he said any deal would need a “different structure”. China is the world’s top importer of both oil and soy, and already buys significant volumes of both from the United States. It is unclear how much more Chinese importers will buy from the United States than they would have otherwise, but any additional shipments would contribute to cutting the trade surplus, as demanded by Trump. Asia’s largest oil refiner, China’s Sinopec (600028.SS) will boost crude imports from the United States to an all-time high in June as part of Chinese efforts to cut the surplus, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday. Sinopec’s trading arm Unipec has bought 16 million barrels, or about 533,000 barrels per day, of U.S. crude to load in June, they said, the largest volume ever to be lifted in a month by the company and worth about $1.1 billion (£823.6 million). “The government has encouraged us to lift more U.S. crude,” one of the sources said. China has been one of the top buyers of U.S. crude exports since Washington lifted a 40-year ban on shipments in late 2015. Since then, U.S. crude exports have risen rapidly as output from shale fields hits record highs. Exports are straining U.S. pipeline and port capacity, and may be reaching a limit until capacity expansion underway are completed, one of the sources said. “We want to buy more but they might not be able to export more,” the source said. Other Chinese refiners are looking to reconfigure their plants so they could buy and process U.S. oil, one trade source said. In agriculture, China’s state grain stockpiler Sinograin returned this week to the U.S. soybean market for the first time since early April, two sources said. Soybeans are America’s top agricultural export to China, worth $12 billion last year, and the absence of Chinese buyers from the market had left U.S. farmers wondering if their biggest buyers was going to want their next harvest. Sinograin enquired about prices for U.S. soybeans this week, traders said, which market participants interpreted as a sign that government curbs on buying American goods had been lifted “Sinograin is in the market today asking U.S. suppliers to make offers for shipment of old-crop as well as new-crop beans for shipment August onwards,” said a source who works at a private soybean crushing company in China. “It is a clear message to even private companies that it is OK now to import U.S. beans.”  Two other sources briefed on the matter said Chinese state grain trader Cofco [CNCOF.UL] would be permitted to buy U.S. soybeans again, ending restrictions imposed by Beijing as trade tensions rose. The sources declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media.  Sinograin, Cofco and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not respond to requests for comment.  The Ministry of Commerce had not told state companies to increase purchases of U.S. soybeans, a ministry spokeswoman said. U.S. Gulf export prices for the new soybean crop rose on Tuesday, which a U.S.-based trader said may indicate a revival in demand from China. Exporters were lining up supplies for October to December shipment, the trader said.  Improving trade relations appeared to be rekindling interest from China for other grains, traders said. That will come as a big relief to U.S. farmers, who saw orders cancelled and business dry up as Washington and Beijing threatened each other with trade tariffs.

2018-05-23,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil benchmarks fell on Wednesday after an unexpected build in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories despite strong demand, and as traders weighed a possible increase in OPEC crude output to cover any shortfalls in supply from Iran and Venezuela. U.S. crude inventories rose 5.8 million barrels last week, while gasoline stocks increased by 1.9 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said. [EIA/S] “Normally, you don’t see builds at this time of year. With Memorial Day Weekend and summer driving season coming up, we were expecting a draw. And getting a build - and such a large build, was surprising,” said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors. Brent crude LCOc1 futures slipped 23 cents to settle at $79.80 a barrel, while U.S. crude CLc1 lost 36 cents to $71.84 a barrel.     “A 5.8 million-barrel build is kind of like a slap in the face, where it’s like, ‘Where did this oil come from?’ And as you look through the numbers, it doesn’t make a lot of sense,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “It is definitely a shock to the system.” The increase in U.S. inventories came from a combination of reduced exports and rising imports. The latter is somewhat surprising, Flynn said, because Brent crude is trading at more than a $7 premium to U.S. crude WTCLc1-LCOc1, making exports more attractive. Indeed, Sinopec (600028.SS), Asia’s largest refiner, will boost U.S. crude oil imports to an all-time high as China tries to reduce its trade deficit with the United States, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. Oil prices have gained nearly 20 percent this year, driven primarily by coordinated supply cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and partners including Russia. OPEC may decide to raise oil output as soon as June as Venezuelan output collapses, U.S. sanctions against Iran loom, and after Washington raised concerns that the oil rally was going too far, OPEC and oil industry sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters.    “It does seem like any move above $80 attracts selling interest right now and that could potentially lead us to a period of consolidation, where I think $77.50 or even $75 might be in focus,” Saxo Bank senior manager Ole Hansen said. Prices have also been affected by rising geopolitical tensions that could dent global output just as demand is set to hit 100 million barrels per day in the final quarter of this year, according to the International Energy Agency.

2018-05-23,"(Adds detail) LONDON, May 23 (Reuters) - Iran’s top leader set out a series of conditions on Wednesday for European powers if they want Tehran to stay in a nuclear deal after the U.S. exit, including steps by European banks to safeguard trade with Tehran and guaranteeing Iranian oil sales. U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out earlier this month from the 2015 nuclear deal that had lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs to its nuclear programme. European powers see the accord as the best chance of stopping Tehran acquiring a nuclear weapon and have intensified efforts to save it. “European banks should safeguard trade with the Islamic Republic. We do not want to start a fight with these three countries (France, Germany and Britain) but we don’t trust them either,” Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted as saying by his website. Khamenei also said European powers must promise they would not seek new negotiations on Iran’s ballistic missile programme and regional Middle East activities, adding: “Europe should fully guarantee Iran’s oil sales. In case Americans can damage our oil sales..., Europeans should make up for that and buy Iranian oil.” Khamenei said that over the past two years the United States “has repeatedly violated” the nuclear deal but the Europeans had remained silent. He asked Europe to “make up for that silence” and to “stand up against the U.S. sanctions.” Khamenei accused the United States of violating U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231 that underpins the nuclear agreement with Iran, and asked Europe to secure “a resolution against the U.S. violation”. He warned that if the Europeans did not meet these demands, Iran would resume its enrichment of uranium, halted under the deal to minimise the risk of Tehran developing the means to build nuclear weapons.

2018-05-23,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top officials from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the departments of Energy and Agriculture plan to meet on Thursday to hammer out details of President Donald Trump’s planned changes to the nation’s biofuel laws, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The meeting marks the latest in a string of high-level talks among Trump administration officials seeking ways to help merchant refiners like Valero Energy Corp reduce the costs of complying with the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard without hurting farmers in the nation’s heartland.  Trump has told some lawmakers he wants to do so by expanding sales of higher-ethanol gasoline blends, counting ethanol exports toward mandated biofuels volumes and scaling back the number of waivers that the EPA can provide to small refiners to free them from the regulation - a set of proposals that includes concessions to both sides. The White House was expected to release the plan last week  but was delayed, the sources said, and Thursday’s meeting is expected to focus on hashing out any remaining legal and political obstacles to the proposals. The meeting will include EPA Deputy Administrator Andrew Wheeler, Energy Department Deputy Secretary Dan Brouillette and Agriculture Department Deputy Secretary Stephen Censky, the sources said. Whether EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Agricultural Secretary Sonny Perdue or Energy Secretary Rick Perry will attend is unclear. White House spokeswoman Kelly Love, EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox, Agriculture Department spokesman Jake Wilkins and Energy Department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes did not respond to a request for comment. The RFS requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of corn-based ethanol or other biofuels into the nation’s fuel each year, and prove compliance by handing in blending credits that can be either earned or purchased. The regulation has created a 15 billion gallon annual market for ethanol, a major boon to the corn industry, but has also angered refiners, which say that the policy costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year. In recent months, the EPA has granted more than two dozen exemptions from the regulation to small refineries to help the refining industry cope with the costs - about triple the typical level under past administrations - infuriating the corn lobby which claims the waivers hurt ethanol demand. Cutting the waiver program back is a key demand of the biofuels industry. The proposal to allow ethanol exports to qualify for credits under the RFS, meanwhile, has been welcomed by refiners as a means of reducing compliance costs but has drawn criticism from the powerful corn lobby, which fears that it amounts to a subsidy and will trigger a trade war. Conversely, expanding the sales of higher-ethanol blends of gasoline known as E15 during the summer months is seen as a big win for the biofuel industry and a setback for refiners - because it will boost seasonal demand for corn and displace petroleum in Americans’ gas tanks.  Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa said she was eager to see that change implemented: “Pruitt has been dragging his feet,” she said in a statement Wednesday.

2018-05-23,"(Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed several legislative initiatives on Wednesday to advance the state’s clean energy goals, including a controversial bill that would subsidize the continued operation of nuclear power plants. The new nuclear law, which could cost about $300 million a year, establishes a Zero Emissions Certificate (ZEC) program to maintain New Jersey’s nuclear energy supply, which contributes close to 40 percent of the state’s electric capacity and is by far its largest source of carbon free energy. Plants seeking to participate in the program would be required, among other things, to demonstrate that they make a significant contribution to New Jersey air quality and are at risk of closure within three years. The four reactors operating in New Jersey are capable of generating over 4,100 megawatts (MW) of electricity. Three are located at the Salem-Hope Creek nuclear plant and are operated by a unit of Public Service Enterprise Group Inc, the state’s biggest power company. One megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes. The other reactor, Oyster Creek, is owned by Exelon Corp, which also owns part of the Salem reactors. Exelon plans to shut Oyster Creek in October 2018 under a long-standing agreement with the state. “Exelon commends New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy...by signing into law a package of legislation that will help to preserve 90 percent of New Jersey’s carbon-free power, protect 5,800 jobs and save residents and businesses $400 million on their electric bills,” Exelon said in a statement. PSEG has warned that it could shut its reactors if they do not receive some sort of federal or state assistance. Nuclear operators have shut several reactors over the past five years and plan to close more as cheap natural gas from shale fields has depressed power prices, making it uneconomic for generators to keep operating some nuclear plants. The new law makes New Jersey the fourth state after New York, Illinois and Connecticut to adopt a program to provide a new revenue stream to keep nuclear reactors in service to help meet the states’ greenhouse gas reduction goals. Other states with reactors set to retire over the next few years for economic reasons, like Pennsylvania and Ohio, and officials in the U.S. Energy Department are also looking at programs to keep nuclear plants operating. In New Jersey, Murphy also signed legislation requiring 50 percent of the state’s power come from renewable sources by 2030, a plan to build 3,500 MW of offshore wind by 2030, a plan to implement energy efficiency programs to reduce electric and gas usage, and a plan to achieve 2,000 MW of energy storage by 2030. The governor also signed an executive order directing state agencies to develop an Energy Master Plan by June 1, 2019 that provides a path to 100 percent clean energy by 2050. “These new laws will preserve and create good-paying jobs and spur billions of dollars in investment in clean energy and energy efficiency across the state,” Ralph Izzo, Chief Executive Officer of PSEG said in a statement. But not everyone is happy with the new nuclear subsidy, including the state’s ratepayer advocate, the Sierra Club, AARP and several power generators that would benefit if the nuclear reactors were to close. “This bill package will mean New Jersey stays hooked on nuclear power at the expense of renewables like solar and wind. It will essentially block our efforts to get to 100 percent renewable energy and will lead to a crash in our solar market,” said Jeff Tittel, Director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, in a statement.

2018-05-23,"AVAZA, Turkmenistan, May 23 (Reuters) - Turkmenistan plans to secure within a few months all the necessary funding to complete the construction of an $8 billion natural gas pipeline to Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, the project’s chief executive said on Wednesday. The Central Asian nation is building the TAPI pipeline to diversify its gas exports, which have mostly gone to China. “We expect the financing to be completed in the third quarter, within the next three-four months,” Muhammetmyrat Amanov, chief executive of TAPI Pipeline company, told an industry conference in the Turkmen resort of Avaza. He said his company was in talks with several export credit agencies such as Italy’s SACE and France’s Hermes, as well as Greek export credit insurer ECIO. TAPI hopes to open the pipeline next year, although security risks, including an attack this week by unknown gunmen on TAPI mine-clearance workers in which six were killed, has raised doubts among analysts about whether it will be finished on time. Amanov did not say how much money TAPI has already raised or mention security issues such as this week’s attack. TAPI said in a brief statement on Tuesday that work continued on schedule despite the attack.

2018-05-23,"* Federal Reserve minutes turn some stock indexes positive * Turkish central bank raises rates sharply to put floor under lira * Trump says trade talks with China need “different structure” * Euro zone slowdown sharper than expected in May -PMI * Oil falls on shock U.S. stock builds, OPEC supply worries (Updates with afternoon trading) By Laila Kearney NEW YORK, May 23 (Reuters) - Global stocks pared losses and the dollar cut gains on Wednesday after the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s May 1-2 meeting amid heightened concerns that setbacks to U.S.-China trade talks would undermine world economic growth. U.S. President Donald Trump said trade discussions with China would need to be rerouted, saying the current track appeared “too hard to get done” and any agreement reached between the world’s two largest economies needed “a different structure.” The remarks came a day after Trump said he was not pleased with U.S.-China talks, reversing a rally pegged to the White House’s optimistic comments about the discussions over the weekend that led to a strong rally on Monday. The selloff was tempered, however, after the Fed released meeting minutes indicating a slower-than-expected rate hike pace, which tipped the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 indexes into positive territory. “You really have to say it is a dovish view to allow inflation to go a little bit above the target for some period of time, recognizing that we have had a long, long run of low inflation,” Mike Baele, managing director at U.S. Bank Private Client Wealth Management in Portland, Oregon said. “As always, the Fed looms large and we will see what happens.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 9.4 points, or 0.04 percent, to 24,825.01, the S&P 500 gained 2.76 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,727.2 and the Nasdaq Composite added 23.49 points, or 0.32 percent, to 7,401.95. Trump also floated plans to fine China’s ZTE Corp and cast doubt on a planned June 12 summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Broad risk aversion hurt the dollar against the Japanese yen. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.63 percent at 110.21 per dollar. But the greenback managed to rise to a six-month high against the euro on data indicating a slowdown in European business activity before paring gains after Wednesday’s Fed minutes release. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 1.16 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.44 percent. Another reason for the euro’s woes is Italy, where an incoming coalition government comprised of the two anti-establishment parties - the League and 5-Star - looks likely to implement big-spending policies. That could add to the country’s big debt pile and see Rome clash with the European Union. Investors were also eyeing Turkey, whose central bank raised interest rates by 300 basis points in an emergency move to put a floor under the plunging lira currency. Turkey’s central bank, which had been scheduled to hold its next policy-setting meeting on June 7, said it had increased its top interest rate to 16.5 percent from 13.5 percent. The lira has fallen about 20 percent so far this year to a series of record lows, but the currency reversed course after the central bank decision and was about 2 percent firmer on the day at 4.5717 to the dollar at 1637 GMT. Investors have sold off their lira holdings on concerns about loose monetary policy, particularly after recent comments by President Tayyip Erdogan, a self-described “enemy of interest rates.” Elsewhere, oil fell after an unexpected build in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories despite strong demand, and as traders weighed the possibility of an increase in OPEC crude output to cover any shortfalls in supply from Iran and Venezuela. U.S. crude fell 0.5 percent to $71.84 per barrel and Brent was last at $79.79, up 0.28 percent on the day.

2018-05-23,"WASHINGTON, May 23 (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats on Wednesday urged President Donald Trump to try to prod OPEC to take steps to lower oil prices and suggested that millions of Americans will see tax cut proceeds canceled out by higher fuel costs. Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer held a news conference at a Capitol Hill Exxon station to criticize Trump for not doing more to lower fuel costs and said that gasoline prices had jumped 25 percent since Trump took office in January 2017. Schumer said Trump’s decision to withdraw from the multinational Iran nuclear deal was a factor in increasing gas prices. He also criticized the administration for planning to rollback fuel economy standards, not doing more to encourage the use of ethanol and for not pushing major oil producing states. “It’s time for this president to stand up to OPEC,” Schumer said of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. “He’s palling around with the Saudis and the UAE and all these other oil-rich countries. Why doesn’t he ask them to lower their prices?” Schumer said, added that Trump “should buck his oil industry buddies.” A letter from Schumer and other Democrats urged Trump to send Energy Secretary Rick Perry to a June 22 OPEC meeting in Vienna to raise the oil prices issue. The news conference came ahead of the busy summer driving season that starts with the U.S. Memorial Day holiday weekend. The White House did not immediately respond to Schumer’s comments. Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican who chairs the Energy Committee, said she agreed “OPEC’s supply restrictions are driving prices higher and should be addressed, but I was stunned to hear my colleagues encouraging more production from the likes of Iran and Saudi Arabia, rather than right here in America.” The push comes as the U.S. Transportation Department has drafted a proposal likely to be made public in early June that backs freezing vehicle emissions requirements at 2020 levels through 2026. On Wednesday, California Air Resources Board chief Mary Nichols held separate meetings with automakers and Trump administration officials in Washington to discuss the emissions rules. Automakers have urged California and U.S. regulators to maintain nationwide fuel efficiency standards. Senator Tom Carper, a Democrat, said a draft of the proposal shows the administration’s preferred alternative would result in Americans using 206 billion more gallons of gasoline through 2050 versus the current standards.

2018-05-23,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s second largest city, Hamburg, will ban the most polluting diesel vehicles from two major streets from next week, a move that could spur others to follow suit and raise pressure on carmakers to consider costly vehicle refits. Hamburg, home to around 1.8 million people, said on Wednesday the ban would start on May 31 and affect diesel models that do not meet the latest Euro-6 emissions standards. This follows a ruling in February by Germany’s top administrative court that the cities of Stuttgart and Duesseldorf should consider bans for older diesels. The detailed publication of that ruling last Friday showed  local authorities were entitled to implement targeted bans with immediate effect to bring air pollution levels into line with European Union rules, although curbs affecting wider city areas should only be phased in over time. Bans on diesel vehicles from city centres are also planned in Paris, Madrid, Mexico City and Athens by 2025, while the mayor of Copenhagen wants to bar new diesel cars from entering the city centre as soon as next year.  Since the German ruling was disclosed, the environment minister of Germany’s northernmost state, Schleswig-Holstein, has said banning older diesel vehicles could also be an option for the regional capital Kiel, a city of about 250,000 people.     Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has long sought to avoid bans, as has the VDA auto industry lobby representing carmakers such as Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler and BMW. Environment Minister Svenja Schulze - a member of the Social Democrats, junior partners in Merkel’s coalition government - urged carmakers to roll out retrofits for diesel cars to lower emissions. “Driving bans like those in Hamburg show how serious the situation is,” she told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. “It’s up to the car industry now.” Levels of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emitted by diesel engines and known to cause respiratory disease should fall significantly as more efficient Euro-6 models are sold and emissions-cleaning software updates take effect, Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer was quoted as saying on Wednesday by the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper. The bans in Hamburg affect a section of about 1.6 km (one mile) on Stresemannstrasse, where the restrictions will apply only to commercial vehicles weighing 3.5 tonnes or more, and a section of about 580 metres on Max-Brauer-Allee, covering all diesel vehicles.  Both thoroughfares are in Altona, a busy district in the west of the city. Drivers aiming for a destination on the two affected streets, including residents, trash collectors, suppliers and taxis, will be exempt from the restrictions as they are designed to filter out through traffic, a spokesman for Hamburg’s environment and energy department said. Of the 330,000 diesel cars on Hamburg’s roads, only about 116,000 have the Euro-6 technology that was introduced in 2014, according to local government data. Police will make random checks and fine drivers of older diesel cars 25 euros (£22) and truck owners up to 75 euros for violating the new rules, he said.

2018-05-23,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Ninety-two-year-old Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad held his first cabinet meeting on Wednesday as officials widen a probe into corruption linked to the previous government with raids on sites linked to the head of a Muslim pilgrimage fund. Mahathir led an opposition coalition to a shock victory in elections this month after campaigning on rising living costs and a promise to clean up corruption. On Wednesday he vowed to cut the national debt of 1 trillion ringgit (188.62 billion pounds). He has also barred former premier Najib Razak and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, from leaving the country, and ordered the anti-graft agency to investigate the disappearance of billions of dollars from state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). Najib, who had ruled the country for a decade, said that Mahathir and his finance minister’s “alarming and confusing” remarks about the country’s debts and 1MDB liabilities “tell half the story” and had caused the stockmarket to fall, in a late-night Facebook post. “While you may want to slander and put all the blame on me to give a perception of a dire financial position to justify why you cannot deliver on your manifesto promises...you must remember that the country and our people comes first,” he wrote. Investigators have already searched Najib’s home and several properties, seizing cash, jewellery and luxury items estimated to be worth millions of dollars. The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) will finish taking a statement from Najib, who ruled the country for almost a decade, on Thursday. In a separate development, police on Tuesday raided five sites linked to Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim, the former government-appointed chairman of Tabung Haji, a fund for Muslim pilgrims to Mecca, an MACC official told Reuters. A number of documents, jewellery and cash were confiscated, said the source, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim was not immediately available for comment. Najib has consistently denied any wrongdoing at 1MDB. New Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said on Wednesday that he has asked for PricewaterhouseCoopers to be appointed for a review and audit of 1MDB. “The directors of 1MDB confirmed that 1MDB was ‘insolvent’ and was unable to repay its debts,” Lim said. Lim said on Tuesday Najib’s government deceived parliament over 1MDB finances and suppressed an investigation by intimidating and purging anti-corruption agents.  Mahathir, who was also prime minister for 22 years from 1981, said after his first cabinet meeting his government would try to cut the national debt, which he put at 65 percent of GDP, by reviewing projects and a 10 percent reduction in cabinet ministers’ salaries. The previous government had said the national debt had been below its self-imposed ceiling of 55 percent of GDP. Malaysia’s stock market  closed 2.2 percent lower, its largest daily fall in more than two years, while the ringgit edged down 0.2 percent against the dollar. Mahathir also said he would review the search by a U.S. firm for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 which disappeared on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board in one of the world’s biggest aviation mysteries.  The new transport minister later said the search would end on Tuesday.  Mahathir also said his government would decide “very soon” on whether to continue with the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur high speed rail project.       Mahathir has already announced plans to revoke a controversial goods and services tax that was intended to rake in 43.8 billion ringgit this year, and reinstate fuel subsidies amid rising oil prices.

2018-05-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - A Turkish vessel carrying wheat to Yemen this month was hit by a rocket or missile and more attacks on merchant ships are likely due to a spillover of the conflict, a senior European naval official said on Wednesday. The Turkish flagged Ince Inebolu bulk carrier was damaged by an explosion on May 10, some 70 miles off the Red Sea port of Salif where it was due to deliver a 50,000 tonne cargo of Russian wheat. “The assessment at the moment is it was almost certainly non-state Yemen based actors firing a land-based missile or rocket at the vessel,” Major Tom Mobbs, head of intelligence and security with the European Union’s counter piracy mission EU Navfor, told Reuters.  “It has sharpened the focus in our mind with this happening.”  Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Sunni Muslim allies have been fighting in Yemen for three years against the Houthis, a Shi’ite group that controls much of North Yemen including the capital Sanaa, and drove a Saudi-backed government into exile in 2014. The Houthis, who are aligned with the Middle East’s pre-eminent Shi’ite power Iran, have fired missiles into Saudi Arabia. The Saudi-led coalition has carried out a campaign of thousands of airstrikes and restricted imports into Yemen, worsening what the United Nations says is potentially the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Mobbs declined to comment on whether the attack on the Turkish ship was carried out by Houthis, adding “that is the natural speculation”.     The ship’s owner Ince Shipping Group said in an emailed statement to Reuters that the vessel had been “hit by an unidentified missile while she was waiting for coalition forces” to give clearance to proceed to the port.  Mobbs said international merchant shipping was “unlikely to be deliberately targeted”.  “Clearly the events show the risk of misidentification and collateral damage,” he said in the sidelines of the launch of a report by the non-profit group Oceans Beyond Piracy.  The Saudi-led coalition says one of the main justifications for its intervention is to protect shipping routes through the narrow Bab al-Mandab waterway, which connects the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea, through which nearly 4 million barrels of oil are shipped daily to Europe, the United states and Asia plus commercial goods.       Saudi and Emirati state media said on Wednesday that the Saudi-led coalition had foiled attacks in the Red Sea by explosives-laden speedboats deployed by Houthis against commercial vessels, including an oil tanker.       Last month, a Saudi oil tanker was hit off Yemen’s main port city of Hodeidah, suffering limited damage, in what coalition forces said was an attack by the Houthis. The Houthis said they had targeted a coalition warship. The worsening situation prompted the international shipping industry in January to issue guidance to mariners of the multiple threats including missiles, sea mines and water-borne improvised explosives devices.     “The same set of circumstances that are prompting these attacks are unlikely to go away, certainly in the near future. So, the attacks will continue,” Mobbs said.

2018-05-23,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Sinopec, Asia’s largest refiner, will boost U.S. crude oil imports to an all-time high as China tries to reduce its trade deficit with the United States, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday. The company’s trading arm Unipec has bought 16 million barrels, or about 533,000 barrels per day (bpd), of U.S. crude to load in June, they said, the largest volume ever to be lifted in a month by the company. “The government has encouraged us to lift more U.S. crude,” one of the sources said. Sinopec could not immediately be reached for comment. China has pledged to buy more U.S. goods to reduce the huge trade deficit with the United States and help ease the threat of a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. Energy and commodities are high on Washington’s list of products for sale. Unipec’s June oil purchases would be worth about $1.1 billion at current prices. They would represent a notable increase in China’s imports of U.S. crude, which have averaged about 330,000 barrels a day for the six-month period ended in February, according to U.S. Energy Department data. An arbitrage opportunity has also opened up after U.S. crude futures recorded the widest discount in three years against Brent at $8.06 a barrel last week, enabling Unipec to boost imports to replace more expensive Middle East oil. Washington is keen to sell more of the country’s surging oil and gas production. However, U.S. energy exports can grow only gradually due to infrastructure bottlenecks, and only if U.S. oil, gas and other goods remain attractively priced compared with global competition. “We want to buy more but they might not be able to export more” because of infrastructure constraints in the U.S. Gulf Coast, a source said. The United States exported a record 2.6 million bpd of crude oil in the week ended May 11, and analysts estimate the country’s limit is somewhere between 3.5 million and 4 million bpd.  However, reaching that level would be a stretch, because only one terminal - the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) - is equipped to handle the very large crude carriers (VLCCs) that transit many Asian ports; the LOOP only started testing VLCCs for export in February. “Whenever we talk about these numbers, the issues are not just of pure dock capacity. For China, the more important issue for them is the size of vessel that you can load. (Of) all of the main (U.S.) regions where loading is occurring, none can load a VLCC directly,” said Sandy Fielden, director of research in commodities and energy at Morningstar. Also, China prefers a heavier quality of crude whereas the bulk of U.S. oil exports is light crude, the source said.

2018-05-23,"(Reuters) - Marathon Petroleum Corp, the second-biggest refining company in the United States, has asked the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for a hardship waiver exempting one of its facilities from the nation’s biofuels law, two sources with knowledge of the application told Reuters. The request comes as the EPA expands its use of biofuel waivers in a way that has reduced regulatory costs for the oil industry by hundreds of millions of dollars in recent months, but which has also infuriated the powerful corn lobby. EPA has authority to grant waivers freeing small refineries from their obligation to mix biofuels such as ethanol into their fuel under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) if they can prove complying would cause them “disproportionate economic hardship.” The waivers can save individual facilities tens of millions of dollars in regulatory costs, adding to a company’s bottom line. Ohio-based Marathon made the waiver application for one of its facilities for the 2017 calendar year, according to the sources, who asked not to be named. The sources did not specify which facility the waiver would cover and did not know whether EPA had made a decision. Marathon spokesman Jamal Kheiry declined to comment and EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox did not respond to requests for comment.  Marathon’s smallest refinery is a 93,000 barrel per day  plant in Canton, Ohio. While that plant has a nameplate capacity above the 75,000 bpd threshold that EPA uses for “small refineries,” the facility could meet the criteria by operating at reduced rates. Refineries typically bring down units at least once a year for maintenance work, limiting production. It is also possible that Marathon made the request for a portion of one of its larger refining complexes, such as its Galveston Bay refinery in Texas, arguing that certain parts of the complex operate distinctly. An EPA source said earlier this year that the agency has granted more than two dozen small refinery waivers for 2017 in recent months, a level that former officials say is about triple the number given each year under previous administrations. The expanded use of biofuel waivers under President Donald Trump’s administration has been a flashpoint between the oil and corn industries. While refining industry representatives have said EPA is required to provide such exemptions to qualifying facilities, corn-state Republicans have said the program is being abused in a way that hurts corn farmers. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa said in an emailed statement that the move was a sign of “how broken this process is.”  “NOTE TO EPA definition of hardship: a condition that is difficult to endure, suffering, deprivation, oppression,” Grassley said separately on Twitter. “Surely Marathon doesn’t qualify for a waiver They had a net income of $3.4B in 2017 BILLIONS IN PROFITS ISNT HARDSHIP.” He and other lawmakers have pressed the EPA to curb the exemptions and to name the companies that have received them. EPA does not reveal the names of waiver applicants or recipients - arguing the information is confidential.  Sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters that large U.S. refiner Andeavor and billionaire Carl Icahn’s CVR Energy were among the companies that had been granted waivers recently – showing EPA is willing to award exemptions to plants owned by big, profitable companies.      Andeavor, which recorded net profits of $1.4 billion in 2017, said this month it saved $100 million in costs from waivers.     Majors Chevron Corp and ExxonMobil Corp have also asked for relief for smaller units, according to sources, though it is unclear if their requests were granted.     Marathon, which owns six refineries and sells gasoline through independent retailers and its Speedway unit, booked net income of $3.4 billion in 2017. It recently announced it is buying Andeavor in a $23.3 billion deal that would make it the nation’s largest refiner. “This is the theater of the absurd. Marathon wants a small refinery hardship waiver at the very moment it is seeking to become the nation’s largest refiner,” Brooke Coleman, head of the Advanced Biofuels Business Council, said. “The federal government should be protecting consumers by scrutinizing mergers like this instead of handing out dividends to multibillion dollar oil companies seeking to monopolize critical energy sectors.”      Prices of the biofuel blending credits that refiners need to prove compliance with the RFS, known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), have fallen to five-year lows in recent weeks as the increase in hardship waivers has turned traditional buyers of credits into sellers.     Marathon has long called for a legislative overhaul of the RFS to ease the burden on refiners but began investing years ago in terminal blending capacity to help curb its RIN expenses.     Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President Timothy Griffith in April 2017 told investors and analysts on a conference call that the costs associated with the RFS are “incorporated into our trading and pricing decision and ultimately recovered and passed on to consumers.” Reporting by Jarrett Renshaw and Chris Prentice in New York; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Susan Thomas",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-biofuels-marathon-pete/exclusive-large-u-s-refiner-marathon-seeks-biofuel-hardship-waiver-sources-idUKL2N1SU0MS,23 May 2018,"Marathon Petroleum Corp, the

2018-05-23,"* Trump says trade talks with China need “different structure” * Euro zone slowdown sharper than expected in May -PMI * Turkish lira down to new record low * Oil falls on shock U.S. stock builds, OPEC supply worries (Updates with opening of U.S. markets; changes dateline, pvs LONDON) By Laila Kearney NEW YORK, May 23 (Reuters) - Global stocks sold off while investors raced for the safety of the Japanese yen and some government bonds on Wednesday as concerns rose that setbacks to U.S.-China trade talks would undermine world economic growth. U.S. President Donald Trump said trade discussions with China would need to be rerouted, saying the current track appeared “too hard to get done” and any agreement reached between the world’s two largest economies needed “a different structure.” The remarks came a day after Trump said he was not pleased with U.S.-China talks, reversing a rally pegged to the White House’s optimistic comments about the discussions over the weekend that led to a strong rally on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 107.45 points, or 0.43 percent, to 24,726.96, the S&P 500 lost 8.16 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,716.28 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 11.66 points, or 0.16 percent, to 7,366.80. Trump also floated plans to fine China’s ZTE Corp and cast doubt on a planned June 12 summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Fears over the further dampening of U.S. relations with China and North Korea weighed on equities, and the Federal Reserve’s May meeting minutes due for release on Wednesday were also giving investors pause, analysts said. “A combination of the Fed and the trade worries will make today a rocky session,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. The minutes, which could indicate the number of rate hikes likely this year, are expected to show the Fed taking a more hawkish tone, Cardillo said. Broad risk aversion hurt the dollar against the Japanese yen. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.75 percent at 110.08 per dollar. But the greenback managed to rise to a six-month high against the euro on data indicating a slowdown in European business activity. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 1.17 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.67 percent. Another reason for the euro’s woes is Italy, where an incoming coalition government comprised of the two anti-establishment parties - the League and 5-Star - looks likely to implement big-spending policies. That could add to the country’s big debt pile and see Rome clash with the European Union. Italian bonds fell in value, reversing the modest gains seen on Tuesday and 10-year yields rose 11 basis points (bps) to a new 14-month high. The premium investors demand to hold Italian debt versus safer German bonds rose sharply to 192 bps. Investors were also eyeing Turkey, which is seemingly headed for a full-blown economic crisis as the Turkish lira plunged to record lows. Elsewhere, oil fell after an unexpected build in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories despite strong demand, and as traders weighed the possibility of an increase in OPEC crude output to cover any shortfalls in supply from Iran and Venezuela. U.S. crude fell 0.98 percent to $71.49 per barrel and Brent was last at $78.89, down 0.85 percent on the day.

2018-05-23,"(Adds comments from former minister and executive, context) By Rodrigo Viga Gaier and Luciano Costa RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO, May 23 (Reuters) - Shares of Brazil’s state-run power company Eletrobras sank on Wednesday after a Congressional decision likely torpedoed for the near future a planned privatization of the company and some of its subsidiaries. Shares of Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras SA, as the company is formally known, lost 10 percent in morning trading in São Paulo, dropping to their lowest level since August, as investors’ hopes for the company’s privatization or the sale of some of its money-losing subsidiaries faded. Late on Tuesday, the head of Brazil’s lower house, Rodrigo Maia, said the chamber would not vote on a presidential decree outlining rules for the sale of state-controlled power companies. He asked President Michel Temer to send a draft bill instead, which would likely take more time to go through both houses of Congress. “It becomes very hard now to head in the direction of a privatization,” former energy minister Fernando Coelho told Reuters on the sidelines of a power industry seminar in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday. With a general election scheduled for October, Congress likely will not have enough time to evaluate and vote on a new draft bill. “Congress was absolutely irresponsible,” Elena Landau, former chairwoman of Eletrobras, told reporters at the power event. Temer’s government announced plans to sell a controlling stake in Eletrobras last August. The presidential decree would have helped clear some of the debt of several power distribution subsidiaries in the north of Brazil that Eletrobras wanted to sell. It would have allowed the firm to receive around 8 billion reais ($2.2 billion) in credits due to those subsidiaries, and was also set to change some power generation policies to give more assurances to investors willing to participate in the sale of Eletrobras. Eletrobras is the largest power generator in Brazil and controls dozens of subsidiaries in all regions. Control of it is a politically sensitive topic, as many politicians have had the power to nominate directors for some of its branches. $1 = 3.6457 reais

2018-05-23,"DUBAI (Reuters) - A Saudi-led military coalition foiled attacks by explosives-laden speedboats deployed by Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi movement against commercial vessels, including an oil tanker, in the Red Sea, Saudi and Emirati state media said on Wednesday. United Arab Emirates (UAE) state news agency WAM reported that UAE coalition forces had destroyed two boats “which were threatening a commercial oil tanker” in the Red Sea. Two other Houthi boats escaped, it added. Later Saudi state news channel al-Ekhbariya said that remote-controlled speedboats rigged with explosives had tried to attack three commercial vessels being escorted by two coalition warships, but that coalition forces had foiled the attack and destroyed three speedboats. Neither the Houthis nor a coalition spokesman could immediately be reached for comment. Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Sunni Muslim allies have been fighting in Yemen for three years against the Houthis, a Shi’ite group that controls much of North Yemen including the capital Sanaa, and drove a Saudi-backed government into exile in 2014. The Houthis, who are aligned with the Middle East’s pre-eminent Shi’ite power Iran, have fired missiles into Saudi Arabia. The Saudi-led coalition has carried out a campaign of thousands of airstrikes and restricted imports into Yemen, worsening what the United Nations says is potentially the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. The coalition says one of the main justifications for its intervention is to protect shipping routes such as the Red Sea, which is used to bring Middle Eastern oil and Asian goods to Europe through the Suez canal. The Saudi and Emirati TV reports did not mention whether any of the ships had been damaged in the incident, nor did they provide any identifying details about the commercial vessels.  Last month, a Saudi oil tanker was hit off Yemen’s main port city of Hodeidah, suffering limited damage, in what coalition forces said was an attack by the Houthis. The Houthis said they had targeted a coalition warship.

Mahathir led an opposition coalition to a shock victory in elections this month after campaigning on rising living costs and a promise to clean up corruption and on Wednesday vowed to cut the national debt of 1 trillion ringgit ($251.67 billion). He has barred former premier Najib Razak and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, from leaving the country, and ordered the anti-graft agency to investigate the disappearance of billions of dollars from state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). Investigators have already searched Najib’s home and several properties, seizing cash, jewellery and luxury items estimated to be worth millions of dollars. The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) will finish taking a statement from Najib, who ruled the country for almost a decade, on Thursday. In a separate development, police on Tuesday raided five sites linked to Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim, the former government-appointed chairman of Tabung Haji, a fund for Muslim pilgrims to Mecca, an MACC official told Reuters. A number of documents, jewellery and cash were confiscated, said the source, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim was not immediately available for comment. Najib has consistently denied any wrongdoing at 1MDB. New Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said on Wednesday that he has asked for PricewaterhouseCoopers to be appointed for a review and audit of 1MDB. “The directors of 1MDB confirmed that 1MDB was ‘insolvent’ and was unable to repay its debts,” Lim said. Lim said on Tuesday Najib’s government deceived parliament over 1MDB finances and suppressed an investigation by intimidating and purging anti-corruption agents. Mahathir, who was also prime minister for 22 years from 1981, said after his first cabinet meeting his government would try to cut the national debt, which he put at 65 percent of GDP, by reviewing projects and a 10 percent reduction in cabinet ministers’ salaries. The previous government had said the national debt had been below its self-imposed ceiling of 55 percent of GDP. Mahathir also said he would review the search by a U.S. firm for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 which disappeared on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board in one of the world’s biggest aviation mysteries. The new transport minister later said the search would end on Tuesday. Mahathir also said his government would decide “very soon” on whether to continue with the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur high speed rail project. Mahathir has already announced plans to revoke a controversial goods and services tax that was intended to rake in 43.8 billion ringgit ($11.05 billion) this year, and reinstate fuel subsidies amid rising oil prices.

2018-05-23,"(Adds details, quote, price reaction) NEW YORK, May 23 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil stockpiles climbed unexpectedly last week as net imports jumped, while gasoline stocks also posted a surprise build, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude inventories rose 5.8 million barrels in the week to May 18, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 1.6 million barrels. Inventories rose in part due to a sharp 1.4 million-barrels-per-day hike in net crude imports. Exports fell 818,000 bpd last week to 1.7 million bpd, after reaching a weekly record of 2.6 million bpd in the previous week. “The large rise in crude oil inventories made for a bearish report, and it came as a result of decent sized drop in exports, along with a large increase in imports,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. Oil prices were down on the news, pulling back from the broader rally on concerns about tightening supply around the world. The collapse of Venezuela’s economy and increased U.S. sanctions is likely to hamper already depressed output from the OPEC member. Renewed U.S. sanctions following the cancellation of the Iran nuclear arms deal may also remove supply from the market. Both of those factors, along with strong demand, have pushed oil to near-four-year highs. Brent crude recently touched $80 a barrel, though it was lower on Wednesday. As of 10:46 a.m. EDT (1446 GMT), Brent was down $1.17 a barrel at $78.40; U.S. crude lost 85 cents to $71.35 a barrel. Refinery crude runs fell by 7,000 bpd, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates rose by 0.7 percentage point to 91.8 percent of total capacity. Gasoline stocks rose by 1.9 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.4 million-barrel drop. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 1 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.3 million-barrel drop, the EIA data showed. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub fell by 1.1 million barrels, EIA said.

2018-05-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - The UK Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) on Wednesday awarded 123 licences to 61 companies to explore for and develop new fields in the North Sea, in the latest sign of confidence in the ageing basin that has enjoyed a revival in recent years. Companies ranging from Royal Dutch Shell RDSaL, BP (BP.L) and Norway’s Equinor EQRN.OL, to smaller independents including Siccar Point, Chrysaor and Premier Oil (PMO.L) were awarded 229 blocks covering a total area of 26,659 square km, the OGA said in a statement.  “The OGA expects this round to lead very quickly to activity, providing a welcome boost to exploration,” it said.  Fourteen of those licences are expected to progress straight to field development planning, it said. The round could unlock about a dozen undeveloped discoveries containing an estimated 320 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe), it added. The North Sea was one of the world’s first offshore basins, and has produced oil for more than four decades.  Although output in the basin has sharply declined since peaking in the late 1990s, it has seen a revival in recent years after large projects such as the BP-operated, 130,000-barrels-per-day Quad 204 in the western Shetlands came on line.  The OGA estimates the North Sea holds reserves of 1.5 billion boe.  “The OGA’s first mature licensing round, following the Norwegian model, appears to have been a great success,” Wood Mackenzie analyst Kevin Swann said in a note. “The UK is in desperate need of new projects to fill a development pipeline that is all but empty beyond the early 2020s,” Swann said. “The eight firm exploration wells among the awards, with big companies like Shell, BP, Equinor and ConocoPhillips among those set to drill, is a big vote of confidence in the UK.

2018-05-23,"ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Lawyers for jailed Congo Republic opposition figure Jean-Marie Michel Mokoko called on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to make his release a condition for the approval of a bailout for the debt-crippled nation. Like other Central African oil producing countries, Congo has been hit by low crude prices. Several neighbours, including Chad and Gabon, have already secured bailouts from the IMF. Last month the Fund said it had “reached broad understandings on policies” it could support and that it would propose a deal once Congo fulfilled conditions including debt restructuring. Mokoko, a former army chief and presidential candidate, was jailed for 20 years this month after his conviction on charges of seeking to topple the government of President Denis Sassou-Nguesso. His supporters said his prosecution was an attempt by Sassou-Nguesso, who has ruled Congo for all but five of the past 38 years, to use the courts to stifle dissent. Paris-based lawyers Jessica Finelle and Etienne Arnaud wrote to IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde on Tuesday requesting that Congo’s human rights situation be factored into any decision on a bailout. “We call upon the IMF to make the agreement about to be ratified by the board conditional upon the end of repression of members of the political opposition ... and the immediate release of Jean-Marie Michel Mokoko,” they said.  Mokoko finished third in the 2016 presidential vote and was arrested later that year.  Congo held a referendum in 2015 that changed the constitution, allowing Sassou-Nguesso to seek a third term in office, leading to protests in which at least 18 people were killed by security forces. Campaign groups say the human rights situation has worsened since the referendum.  Over 20 opposition activists were arrested earlier this month during peaceful protests in the coastal city of Pointe-Noire, according to Amnesty International.  The IMF acknowledged it received the letter but would not say whether it would respond to the demands of the Mokoko’s legal team. “IMF lending and conditionality decisions are based on considerations that fall within the scope of its mandate, i.e. as a specialised agency tasked with promoting economic and financial stability,” it said. While the Fund has said that the implementation of reforms to improve governance is among the conditions for an agreement with Congo, it has made no specific mention of human rights.  The IMF said Congo was still in talks with its creditors, which include commodities traders Trafigura [TRAFGF.UL] and Glencore, to make its debt load more sustainable.

2018-05-23,"(Adds quote, details) By Nidhi Verma and Swati Bhat NEW DELHI/MUMBAI, May 23 (Reuters) - India will take a long-term view on the retail pricing of petrol and diesel to shield consumers from volatility in global markets, the government said on Wednesday, suggesting it could change the way pump prices are calculated. Prices of diesel and petrol in India have surged to a record high, stoking opposition criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration for causing hardship to ordinary people. Rising global crude prices are largely behind the surge, but fuel is also heavily taxed by India’s state and federal authorities, accounting for about half the cost of petrol and 40 percent of the diesel price. In Delhi, petrol costs 77.17 rupees ($1.13) a litre and diesel costs 68.34 rupees a litre. “The government is keen that instead of having an ad hoc measure it may be desirable to have a long-term view which addresses not only the volatility but also takes care of the unnecessary ambiguity arising out of frequent ups and downs,” Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told a news conference. India is particularly at risk from stronger global prices for crude oil as it is the No.3 importer of the commodity buying about 80 percent of its oil needs. The South Asian nation has a surplus of refined products, but local prices of petrol and diesel are linked to Singapore gasoline prices GL95-SIN and Arab Gulf diesel prices GO-AG. The pump price of the two locally-refined fuels also include import tax on the two products which the government could tinker with to help customers, industry sources say. M. K. Surana, chairman of state-run fuel retailer and refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp, said the government should review taxation of petrol and diesel to provide relief to the customer. “The long term solution is to bring all the petroleum products under goods and service tax that will rationalise the taxation structure,” he added. Opposition leaders have criticised the government for failing to rein in rising fuel prices, a politically-sensitive issue in one of the world’s biggest economies. Rising pump prices are already adding to inflationary pressure and are strengthening the case for a rate hike. India’s Economic Survey, issued by the finance ministry at the end of January, estimated a $10 per barrel rise in global oil prices reduced growth by 0.2-0.3 percentage points, increased wholesale price inflation by about 1.7 percentage points and worsens the current account deficit by about $9-10 billion. Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram of the opposition Congress Party tweeted that there was space to reduce petrol prices by about 25 rupees a litre. “Fuel price hike has a cascading effect on inflation and the Reserve Bank of India will have to front-load interest rate hikes now,” said Rupa Rege Nitsure, group chief economist at L&T Finance Holdings in Mumbai. $1 = 68.3650 Indian rupees

2018-05-23,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cabinet agreed on Wednesday to grant compensation of up to 1 billion euros to utilities for income lost due to Germany’s planned phasing out of nuclear power, the environment ministry said. A Constitutional Court ruled in 2016 that a decision in 2011 to decommission nuclear power stations by the end of 2022 violated some property rights, clearing the way to compensation but leaving the amount open.  Utilities affected include RWE (RWEG.DE), Vattenfall and E.ON (EONGn.DE). A draft law seen by Reuters was drawn up last month, stating that the amount would probably be in the high three-digit-million euros range. A ministry spokesman said he could not put an exact figure on the compensation. The cabinet agreed that utilities could now demand financial compensation for investments in nuclear power plants made between October 2010 and March 2011. Merkel’s government decided in October 2010 to push back a decommission date for nuclear power plants by several years, causing companies to invest in their sites. But only several months later, the government decided to scrap its earlier decision and speed up the nuclear phase out in light of the Fukushima reactor explosion in Japan. The cabinet also agreed that RWE and Vattenfall should get “adequate financial compensation” for electricity at closed nuclear power plants at Brunsbuettel, Kruemmel and Muelheim-Kaerlich.

The yen rose more than 1 percent against the dollar, U.S. bond yields, which move inversely to price, fell to eight-day lows. World shares meanwhile slipped half a percent to a two-week low as weak euro zone data added to negative sentiment following U.S. President Donald Trump’s comments on the crucial trade talks. Investors were also eyeing Turkey and Italy, with the former seemingly headed for a full-blown economic crisis as the Turkish lira plunged to new record lows. Italian borrowing costs resumed their rise to hit new multi-month highs on fears that an incoming coalition will sharply boost government spending. The risk-off mood was initially triggered by Trump saying he was not pleased with progress on trade talks with China. The comments tempered optimism that China and the United States would be able to avert a damaging global trade war. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had said at the weekend the “trade war” was “on hold”. Trump also floated plans to fine China’s ZTE Corp and cast doubt on a planned June 12 summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. Those developments are set to weigh on Wall Street later in the day, with S&P500 and Dow Jones futures down 0.6-0.8 percent . In Asian trading, MSCI’s ex-Japan Asian equity benchmark fell 0.3 percent and Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.2 percent to reach 1-1/2-week lows. European shares also fell, with one pan-European stock index down 1 percent. “People have realised the risk of trade war remains with us,” Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners chief investment officer Francois Savary said. “Increase in trade was a major reason behind the synchronised global growth and if you blow this up you limit the opportunities for the world economy,” he said. Such worries were underscored by flash Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data, which showed on Wednesday that the euro zone economy was slowing more sharply than previously expected. The data, along with the global sentiment setbacks, sent euro zone bond yields broadly lower, while U.S. Treasury yields slipped to an eight-day low after retreating sharply on Tuesday from near seven-year highs. They are now on the cusp of slipping back under the psychologically significant 3-percent level. “Italy’s political impasse continues, French and German PMIs were soft and global risk sentiment has taken another knock,” Societe Generale analysts said. Prime Partners’ Savary was more sanguine on the data, noting that growth, while slowing, remained healthy. But he warned that trade issues alongside geopolitics, especially the reimposition of Iran sanctions, could have economic consequences associated with potentially higher inflation. Oil prices came off 3-1/2-year highs hit on concerns over supply from Venezuela and Iran. Brent futures were down 1 percent, inching further from the $80 per barrel milestone. Lower U.S. yields sapped some of the appetite for the dollar, taking it more than 1 percent lower against the yen , heading for its biggest daily loss in a year. Bond and currency traders worldwide are now waiting for U.S. Federal Reserve minutes from its last meeting, to glean clues on how many more times the central bank might raise interest rates in 2018. The minutes are due later on Wednesday. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar rose 0.2 percent and the euro bore the brunt with a 0.4-percent loss. The single currency also fell against another “safe” asset, the Swiss franc, touching a near two-month low. One reason for the euro’s woes is Italy, where an incoming coalition government comprised of the two anti-establishment parties - the League and 5-Star - looks likely to implement big-spending policies. That could add to the country’s big debt pile and see Rome clash with the European Union. Italian bonds fell in value, reversing the modest gains seen on Tuesday and 10-year yields rose 11 basis points (bps) to a new 14-month high. The premium investors demand to hold Italian debt versus safer German bonds rose sharply to 192 bps. The spread was about 120 bps at the start of May. Italian stocks tumbled 1.8 percent and are so far suffering their biggest monthly losses since mid-2016. Investors are watching to see if the eurosceptic Paolo Savona would be appointed to the economy minister position. “It is a major blow for Europe potentially,” Savary said. “As long as (coalition partners) play the game of speaking unwisely, bond yields can go higher.” Elsewhere, emerging markets remained under heavy pressure, with currencies down 0.3-0.6 percent across the board. The selling storm was concentrated on Turkey where the lira fell more than 3.5 percent, bringing losses just in May to more than 16 percent. Turkish bond yields have jumped to almost 15 percent, more than 250 bps up from the end of April, with an emergency interest rate rise looking all but certain. “I doubt (the Turkish central bank) have time to wait until June 7 for the scheduled meeting – the lira is in freefall and concrete steps are urgently required to slow down this quite rapid rate of depreciation,” Rabobank analyst Piotr Matys said.

2018-05-23,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s top climate envoy on Wednesday said the country could meet its pledge to cap carbon emissions ahead of its target of around 2030, while a senior environmental official said plans for a carbon market were on track despite ministerial restructuring.  Xie Zhenhua, China’s chief negotiator on the Paris climate agreement in late 2015, said China has already met several objectives it promised to fulfil by 2020, including cutting its carbon intensity by 40 percent to 45 percent three years early.  China, the world’s biggest emitter of climate-warming greenhouse gases, has reiterated its commitment to the Paris deal despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to pull the United States out of the agreement. Speaking at a seminar on global climate governance and the Sino-American climate relationship in Beijing, Xie expressed a “personal opinion” that it was “possible” to meet the 2030 target in advance, based on what China had already achieved, and that its actual carbon intensity reduction by 2020 could be greater. A study by Chinese researchers published in November said China could bring its emissions to a peak by 2023.    Li Gao, head of the climate department at China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE), said on the sidelines of the meeting that there would be no delays to the development of the country’s carbon market despite a restructuring of Chinese ministries in March. The restructuring replaced the Ministry of Environmental Protection with the MEE, and gave it responsibility for all climate matters, including the management and adaptation of carbon emissions trading systems, and for international negotiations. Climate experts have previously expressed concern that the transfer of responsibilities from the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the state planner, to the MEE would disrupt progress on the nationwide carbon market at a crucial time in its development. They also worry that the MEE lacks the clout of the NDRC to advance the climate agenda. Both Xie and Li previously worked for the NDRC. China formally launched the first phase of its nationwide carbon market last December after months of delays. It currently covers only the power sector but will be extended to other emitters at a later stage.

2018-05-23,"* Sumitomo president: Sierra Gorda may turn profitable next year * Looking to invest in upstream metals and energy * To boost investment in natural resources and chemical business By Yuka Obayashi and Ritsuko  Shimizu TOKYO, May 23 (Reuters) - Japan’s Sumitomo Corp sees its Ambatovy nickel-cobalt project in Madagascar and Sierra Gorda copper project in Chile turning profitable within three years, as the mines recover from repeated delays and damage from inclement weather. While the 99-year-old trading house managed to turn in a record net profit in the year ended March 2018 on robust metal prices, its results continue to be pressured by losses from the two projects. “We hope the two projects to turn profitable within three years,” Sumitomo President Masayuki Hyodo told Reuters. “Sierra Gorda may reach full utilisation and turn profitable next year,” Hyodo said, adding that for Ambatovy, he wants “the turn-around to happen this year”. Earlier this month, the company projected losses from its Sierra Gorda stake would widen 38 percent to 1.1 billion yen ($10 million) in the year to March 2019, while narrowing about 30 percent from its Ambatovy stake to 9.8 billion yen. Sumitomo owns 47.7 percent of Ambatovy and 13.5 percent of Sierra Gorda. Hit by technical problems and damages caused by cyclone, Sumitomo has booked a total impairment loss of 77 billion yen on Ambatovy and 47.6 billion yen on Sierra Gorda over the past few years. However, stronger profit contributions from its silver, zinc and lead project in Bolivia and iron ore project in South Africa helped boost its profit in the resource segment last year. To reinforce its natural resources and chemical business, Sumitomo plans to invest 190 billion yen in the segment over the next three years, up 6 percent from the previous three years. Hyodo said the company was looking to invest in upstream assets in both metals and energy. Japanese trading houses are scouting for assets as they enjoy their best profit outlook in six years. But smarting from huge writedowns in the last investment cycle, big debt-fuelled acquisitions still look to be off the agenda. “We will selectively invest in the metals and energy which will attract higher demand as global population grows,” Hyodo said, adding copper, nickel and cobalt as well as natural gas and oil were potential targets. The 58-year old Hyodo, who became president for the trading house last month, has expertise in electric power business, having spent considerable time on Sumitomo’s Tanjung Jati B coal-fired power project in Indonesia. Sumitomo, a major power producer with global capacity of about 7,500 megawatt, aims to reduce the ratio of coal-fired power in its portfolio to 30 percent by 2035 from 50 percent while raising renewable energy to 30 percent from 20 percent. “We won’t build any more pure coal-fired stations in developed countries including Japan,” he said. “But we’ll continue to provide coal-fired power plants in developing countries,” he said, citing financial and technical difficulties in supplying all additional power through renewable energy and natural gas.

2018-05-23,"DUBAI, May 23 (Reuters) - A Kuwait Petroleum Corporation-owned firm plans to borrow up to $2.6 billion from banks and export credit agencies to build a liquefied natural gas import terminal, banking sources said. Kuwait Integrated Petroleum Industries Company (KIPIC) will use the money raised to develop the terminal at Kuwait’s Al Zour complex, which also has a refinery and a petrochemical facility. KPC did not respond to requests for comment on the planned loan for the LNG facility, which will be used to meet domestic demand for gas and is expected to be operating by 2020. Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) is advising KIPIC on the financing, which will also include a loan denominated in Kuwaiti dinars and backed by local banks. Hyundai Engineering, Hyundai Engineering & Construction and Korea Gas Corporation are building the project, the banking sources told Reuters. The $2.6 billion international debt facility, with a maturity of around 15 years, is coordinated by four banks, and will partly be backed by the Export-Import Bank of Korea (Kexim) and Korea Trade Insurance Corporation (K-Sure). The local loan will be worth up to $800 million, with Islamic and conventional tranches, one source said. Kuwait Finance House is leading the Islamic tranche and National Bank of Kuwait the conventional one, with Gulf Bank and Commercial Bank of Kuwait also involved. State-owned KPC plans to invest more than $500 billion by 2040 as it aims to boost its crude oil production capacity to 4.75 million barrels per day by then. KPC expects to spend $114 billion in capex over the next five years and an additional $394 billion beyond that to 2040, Chief Executive Nizar al-Adsani said this year.

2018-05-23,"BEIJING, May 23 (Reuters) - China’s independent oil refiners are once again using fuel oil to feed their plants as stricter tax enforcement and rising crude oil prices have squeezed their margins. These independent refiners, nicknamed teapots, buy nearly one-fifth of China’s crude imports and any reduction in their crude purchases would cap demand in what is now the world’s biggest oil importer. Two independent refiners based in the eastern province of Shandong, home to most of China’s teapots, have each bought an 80,000 tonne cargo of straight-run fuel oil (SRFO) cargo, together totalling about 1.02 million barrels, for April and May delivery, according to three traders with knowledge of the deals. One cargo is arriving from Abu Dhabi and the other from Singapore, said one of the sources, an executive with a western trader involved in the supply talks. The independents had primarily used straight-run fuel oil, the residue left after crude oil has been initially distilled in a refinery, as a feedstock for their plants since it cost less than crude oil and was taxed less. However, in 2014, the Chinese government raised taxes on fuel oil imports. But, that was followed in 2015 by teapots winning licences to import crude. Straight-run fuel oil consumption slumped as the refiners bought crude oil, which yielded a higher volume of higher-value products such as gasoline and diesel than the SRFO when processed and boosted profit margins for the teapots. China remained a large buyer of so-called cracked fuel oil as fuel for ships. However, starting on March 1, Beijing enacted new tax rules that more rigidly enforced on the teapots the collection of a $38 per barrel gasoline consumption tax and $29 per barrel tax on diesel. Combined with a recent surge in crude oil prices to their highest since 2014, the higher tax collection has crushed the independent’s margins. That has prompted the renewed interest in lower-priced fuel oil. “Buying SRFO may not necessarily save tax cost as the buyer needs to pay up-front the (fuel oil) consumption tax, but obviously plants are exploring the old trade as the government’s tax stick is really a hard one this time,” said the oil trading executive. Processing the SRFO does have an added tax benefit, however. The independents can deduct the tax of about $31 per barrel paid on their fuel oil imports from the consumption tax they are required to collect on their gasoline and diesel sales, said an official with an independent plant seeking fuel oil. “Processing fuel oil gives better margins than (refining) crude oil as plants can get tax deducted (when selling refined fuel) later,” the official said. The source, who declined to be named as he is not authorized to talk to press, added that his plant expected margins to be negative if they only processed crude oil. The lower margins have resulted in the teapots cutting their run rates. In early May, the independent refiners operated at only 63 percent of their processing capacity, the lowest since February during the Lunar New Year break, according to a weekly survey of 38 plants by Shandong-based consultancy Sublime China Information. Planned maintenance was also a factor, said Gao Lei, an analyst with Sublime. “We’ve seen less impact (from the tax measures) on import volumes as state-run plants increase runs, but more on teapot margins,” said Seng-Yick Tee, of consultancy SIA Energy, “They are definitely making less money now than before.” Additional reporting by Roslan Khasawaneh and Florence Tan in

2018-05-23,"OSLO (Reuters) - The Norwegian Supreme Court began hearing an appeal on Wednesday from some of the owners of the Gassled gas network that are challenging government cuts to pipeline tariffs. A Norwegian appeals court ruled in 2017 against the owners in a lawsuit in which they had argued that the cut in tariffs was unlawful and would cost them 15 billion Norwegian crowns (1.4 billion pounds) in lost earnings through 2028. The case against the government is being pursued by four investment companies - Solveig Gas, Silex Gas, Infragas and CapeOmega - which bought Njord Gas Infrastructure, the original owner. Together they hold a combined 48.2 percent of Gassled. “The state has one sidedly reduced tariffs in the middle of the concession period ... by 90 percent,” Thomas K. Svensen, representing the Gassled owners, told the Supreme Court. “How much protection does the law give owners?” he asked the five-strong panel. The four investment companies were originally owned by Allianz (ALVG.DE), UBS (UBSG.S), the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Canada’s Public Sector Pension Investment Board, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and France’s Caisse des Depots. In October 2017, UBS and Caisse des Depots said they were selling their stakes to Cape Omega, but they will still be in line for any potential proceeds from a decision in favour of the Gassled partners. They will also help pay legal costs. Some of the companies involved have said Norway’s unexpected decision to lower gas transportation tariffs would hurt the image of Norway as an investment destination. The government cut tariffs shortly after the four investors bought their stakes in Gassled in 2011 and 2012 from ExxonMobil (XOM.N), Total (TOTF.PA), Statoil STL.OL and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) for a total of 32 billion crowns. Lawyers representing the aggrieved Gassled owners will continue presenting their arguments this week. The Norwegian state will present its arguments next week.

2018-05-23,"ANKARA (Reuters) - For all of Iran’s fierce verbal response to fresh U.S. threats of tougher sanctions, some senior officials in Tehran believe the door to diplomacy should stay open. On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo presented a list of sweeping demands for Iran, including abandoning nuclear enrichment, its ballistic missile programme and its role in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen, or face “the strongest sanctions in history”. Four senior Iranian officials contacted by Reuters interpreted Pompeo’s remarks as a “bargaining strategy”, similar to Washington’s approach to North Korea. Last year U.S. officials were pressing for tougher sanctions against Pyongyang and sent an aircraft carrier to the region in a show of strength before relations eased to a point where President Donald Trump may hold talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “America does not want to get involved in another war in the region. Iran also cannot afford more economic hardship ... always there is a way to reach a compromise,” said one of the Iranian officials, who was involved in Iran’s nuclear talks with major powers for two years.  “The era of military confrontations is over,” the official said. Like others giving their views on relations with the United States, the official asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. However, it will be difficult for Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to back any diplomatic solution, because doing so could undermine his credibility among his hardline power base, who reject any detente with the West. “They (Americans) are lying. Even if Iran accepts all these demands, they will continue to demand more. Their aim is changing Iran’s regime,” said one official who is close to Khamenei’s camp. “Americans can never be trusted. We don’t give a damn to their threats and sanctions,” he said, echoing Khamenei’s public statements. Pompeo’s speech did not explicitly call for a change in leadership in Iran, but he urged the Iranian people to reject their clerical rulers. Earlier this month the United States withdrew from a 2015 multinational deal which restricted Iran’s nuclear programme in return for lifting sanctions that had crippled the economy. Tehran says its right to nuclear capabilities and its defensive missile programme are non-negotiable. But with Iran’s economy so fragile, weakened by decades of sanctions, corruption and mismanagement, Khamenei may yet consider diplomacy over confrontation with the United States. Some insiders said that, though difficult, he could drink “the cup of poison,” as his predecessor Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini described it when he reluctantly agreed to a U.N.-mediated truce that ended the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. “For most Iranians, the economy is the main issue, not what Iran does in the region or the country’s nuclear programme,” said a senior Western diplomat in Tehran. “That is why Iranian leaders will show some flexibility despite the harsh rhetoric.” It was Iran’s weak economy that forced Khamenei to give tentative backing for the 2015 nuclear agreement with major powers. The deal, engineered by pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani, ended the country’s economic and political isolation. The establishment’s core support comes from lower-income Iranians, who joined anti-government protests in January. The unrest was a reminder to authorities that they were vulnerable to popular anger fuelled by economic hardship.  “If they fail to manage the economy, then the regime will not be able to resist the pressure. It does not mean it will fall apart, but the economy could reach its worst ever breaking point,” said Meir Javedanfar, an Iranian-born expert on Iran at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya in Israel. European parties to the nuclear deal are trying to rescue it after Washington’s exit by keeping Iranian oil trade and investment flowing. But they concede it will be difficult. A third Iranian official said he expected that the United States would eventually have to accept some level of Iranian uranium enrichment activity and ballistic missile work, because “these are Iran’s red lines”. In his speech, Pompeo tried to quash talk of war by saying Washington would lift punishing sanctions it is now moving to impose, restore diplomatic and commercial ties and allow Iran to have access to advanced technology if Washington saw tangible shifts in Iran’s policies. Several Iranian officials told Reuters that the hardline elite, including Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), viewed Pompeo’s demands as a “declaration of war” against Iran. Analysts said the risk of a broader conflict could not be ruled out, despite running counter to Trump’s own stated desire to disentangle the United States from a generation of costly conflicts in the Middle East. “If Americans push Iran to the corner ... then Iran will have no other option but to react harshly,” said Tehran-based analyst Saeed Leylaz. “This is what hawks want.” While Tehran has said it would respond to any military aggression by targeting U.S. interests in the region and Israel, some experts said the country would struggle to defend itself against a direct, multi-fronted attack. “Iran has done well in proxy wars, but they cannot confront Israel or the U.S. in a direct war,” said the Western diplomat. “They don’t have modern weapons.”  Shi’ite Muslim Iran backs President Bashar al-Assad in Syria’s civil war, Shi’ite militias in Iraq, Houthi rebels in Yemen’s conflict and Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement. Washington’s regional allies, Sunni Gulf Arab states and Israel — staunch foes of Tehran — have all praised the United States’ toughening stance on Iran.

2018-05-23,"* Osaka Gas seeking to boost trading of LNG * Intent on LNG supplies may be boost for new projects * Utility plans to resell 3 mln tonnes LNG in 2020 By Osamu Tsukimori OSAKA, Japan, May 23 (Reuters) - Osaka Gas may sign new long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) contracts as Japan’s second-biggest city gas supplier boosts its trading operations amid a shake-up in the Asian market for the fuel, a senior official said. The comment signals there may be a willing buyer of long-term supplies in Japan, where utilities have been spurning such contracts because of a ready availability of the fuel on a short-term, or spot, basis, excess supplies and falling demand. The resistance to long-term contracts among buyers in Japan, the world’s biggest importer of LNG, in recent years has been one factor for a dearth of new big export projects coming online, as developers need commitments over many years. “We are interested in signing new contracts as we make efforts to increase the overall trading volumes,” Keiji Takemori, senior general manager of LNG trading at Osaka Gas, told Reuters in an interview. He said he would prefer to sign any new long-term contracts soon. Takemori declined to say if he would be interested in signing up for supplies from Mozambique or Canada, where there are signs developers may ramp up construction of LNG export projects. He said the company will look for long-term contracts that do not have restrictions on resale, so it can trade the cargoes. No decision has been made on extending long-term contracts with Indonesia and Qatar due to expire by 2021. Osaka Gas expects to raise the ratio of free-on-board contracts to above 70 percent by 2021 from 50 percent now, making it easier to trade cargoes. Osaka Gas has signed contracts to resell more than 3 million tonnes of LNG in 2020, nearly three times the amount in the year ended March 31, 2017, a move that may boost liquidity in Asia’s natural gas markets. The Osaka-based utility plans to increase LNG purchases, including for resale, to more than 10 million tonnes in 2020, up from 9.5 million tonnes in the year through March 2017. Japan’s anti-trust agency ruled last year that so-called destination clauses in long-term LNG contracts that prevent the resale of cargoes are anti-competitive. That has led big Japanese LNG buyers to push for contracts without the clauses and fuelled an increase in trading cargoes.

2018-05-23,"PARIS (Reuters) - Emmanuel Macron heads to St Petersburg on Thursday seeking to win concessions from Vladimir Putin, but with Europe-U.S. ties strained over Iran, the Russian leader may have little incentive to offer the French president a diplomatic success. A year after hosting Putin in the regal halls of the Chateau de Versailles, Macron will seek common ground on Syria and Ukraine during a two-day visit and Moscow’s help in salvaging the Iran nuclear deal abandoned by U.S. President Donald Trump. “The weakness of the transatlantic relationship does not give Macron sufficiently strong positions to counter Putin,” said Tatiana Kastoueva-Jean, director of the Russia centre at the Paris-based Institute for International Relations. “Putin knows that there are differences in the Western camp and as soon as someone shows weakness he exploits it.” Macron has banked on nurturing relationships with awkward leaders such as Putin, appearing engaged on the world stage but remaining non-committal and trying to mediate among opposing sides without unsettling anyone. That policy is now being tested after Trump shunned Macron and other close allies and imposed extraterritorial sanctions on Iran, having already pulled out of the global climate pact and threatened the EU with tariffs on metals.   The U.S. move has left Paris, London and Berlin scrambling to rescue the nuclear deal knowing their interests are not necessarily aligned with the two remaining signatories - Russia and China.   Macron hopes to entice all sides into a grand bargain that would tackle Tehran’s nuclear programme and also address fears over its ballistic missile activity and regional influence as a means to bringing the United States back into the fold.  “We must have a frank dialogue with Russia, but also a demanding dialogue,” Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told France Inter radio. A senior French diplomat was more direct: “A lot needs to be done to convince the Russians because it has interests in the Middle East, especially Syria, and its stance towards the West is aggressive.” Rather than confronting Putin directly in public, Macron has favoured private dialogue and pushed for a restoration of business and cultural ties despite European Union sanctions on Moscow.  Invited as guest of honour to an economic forum at which French firms including Total (TOTF.PA), Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) and Sanofi (SASY.PA) will be present, Macron will on Friday trumpet improved trade ties that have seen French exports steadily recover after a drop in 2015.           But his broad strategy has shown its limits. Over the last year Moscow has not shifted on Syria, where it continues to back President Bashar al-Assad militarily, or in Ukraine, where last week Putin again excluded the restoration of Crimea, annexed in 2014.   Yet even after Britain accused Russia of orchestrating a nerve-gas attack on its soil - further souring EU-Russia ties - Macron has stressed that ostracising Moscow would not yield results. “I felt the eagerness of this dynamic young and ambitious man to quickly find concrete solutions, but alas in life it is a little more complicated. The solution in Syria as in Ukraine depends not only on us or the French, but other actors,” former Russian ambassador to France Alexander Orlov told Reuters. “Nevertheless there is this positive approach on the part of President Macron ... and he is ready to cooperate with Russia to find solutions.”  Few see any likelihood of a breakthrough on Ukraine. However, French diplomats hope the risk of a direct confrontation between Israel and Iran in Syria and the lack of a Syrian political transition process will encourage Putin to yield some ground. But highlighting just how one-sided Macron’s efforts have been, he sent at least two letters to Putin - one last summer and one at the end of the year - outlining concrete areas in which he believed Putin could pressure Assad to ease humanitarian access in the war-torn country.  Neither letter drew a response. “Beyond France’s prestige and commercial opportunities, an effective French diplomacy must ask what levers it can use vis-à-vis recalcitrant actors,” said Jalel Harchaoui, a geopolitics researcher at Paris 8 University. “It seems this basic question is no longer being asked in Paris. “When you conduct foreign policy without a carrot or a stick, that’s what you get.”   Additional reporting by Marine Pennetier; Editing by Richard Lough and Richard Balmforth",https://uk.reuters.com/article/russia-france-macron/update-1-trump-factor-leaves-macron-scrambling-ahead-of-russia-trip-idUKL5N1SU1MB,23 May 2018,"* Macron wants progress in talks on Iran, Syria, Ukraine

The yen rose 1 percent against the dollar, U.S. bond yields fell to eight-day lows and world shares slipped half a percent from one-week highs as weak euro zone data added to negative sentiment after U.S. President Donald Trump’s comments on the crucial trade talks. Investors were also watching Turkey and Italy, with the former seemingly headed for a full-blown crisis as the currency plunged to new record lows. Italian borrowing costs resumed their rise back towards recent multi-month highs on fears an incoming coalition will sharply boost government spending. The risk-off mood was initially triggered by Trump saying he was not pleased with progress on trade talks with China. The comments tempered earlier optimism that China and the United States would be able to avert a damaging global trade war. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had said earlier the “trade war” was “on hold”. Trump also floated plans to fine China’s ZTE Corp and cast doubt on a planned June 12 summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. Those developments drove Wall Street to a weaker close on Tuesday and filtered into Asia where MSCI’s ex-Japan equity benchmark fell 0.3 percent. Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.2 percent to reach 1-1/2-week lows. The pan-European stock index meanwhile fell 0.8 percent while futures signalled a sharply weaker open for New York markets. “People have realised the risk of trade war remains with us,” said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners. “Increase in trade was a major reason behind the synchronised global growth and if you blow this up you limit the opportunities for the world economy.” Such worries were underscored by flash Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data which showed on Wednesday that the euro zone economy was slowing more sharply than previously expected. The data, along with the global sentiment setbacks, sent euro zone bond yields broadly lower, while U.S. Treasury yields slipped to an eight-day low after retreating sharply on Tuesday from near seven-year highs. “Italy’s political impasse continues, French and German PMIs were soft and global risk sentiment has taken another knock,” Societe Generale analysts said. Savary was more sanguine on the data, noting that growth, while slowing, remained healthy. But he warned that trade setbacks alongside geopolitics, especially the reimposition of Iran sanctions, could have economic consequences via potentially higher inflation. Oil prices held near 3-1/2-year highs on concerns over supply from Venezuela and Iran. But Brent futures slipped 0.5 percent, coming off the $80 per barrel milestone. Lower U.S. yields sapped some of the appetite for the dollar, taking it almost 1 percent lower against the yen . Against a basket of currencies, however, it rose 0.3 percent, with the euro hitting a new six-month low against the greenback. The single currency also fell against another “safe” asset, the Swiss franc, touching a two-month low. One reason for the euro’s woes is Italy, where an incoming coalition government comprised of the far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star looks likely to implement big-spending policies. That could add to the country’s big debt pile and see Rome clash with the European Union. Italian bonds fell in value, reversing the modest gains seen on Tuesday after six days of selling that took 10-year yields to their highest in 14 months. Italian stocks tumbled 1.8 percent and are so far suffering their worst month since mid-2016. Investors are watching to see if the eurosceptic Paolo Savona would be appointed to the key economy minister position. “It is a major blow for Europe potentially,” Savary said. “As long as (coalition partners) play the game of speaking unwisely, bond yields can go higher.” Elsewhere, emerging markets remained under heavy pressure but fears were concentrated on Turkey where the lira fell more than 3.5 percent, bringing losses just in May to 16 percent. Turkish bond yields have jumped almost to 15 percent, more than 250 bps higher since end-April, with an emergency interest rate rise looking all but certain.

In June 2017, a Norwegian appeals court ruled against the owners in a lawsuit that argued the cut in tariffs was unlawful and would cost them a combined 15 billion Norwegian crowns ($1.86 billion) in lost earnings through 2028. The case against the government is being pursued by four investment companies, Solveig Gas, Silex Gas, Infragas and CapeOmega, which bought original owner Njord Gas Infrastructure. Together they hold a combined 48.2 percent of Gassled. The four firms were originally owned by Allianz, UBS, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Canada’s Public Sector Pension Investment Board, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and France’s Caisse des Depots. In October 2017, UBS and Caisse des Depots announced they were selling their stakes to Cape Omega, but will still remain in line for any potential proceeds from a decision in favour of the Gassled partners, and will help pay the cost of litigation. Some of the companies involved have said Norway’s unexpected decision to lower gas transportation tariffs would hurt the image of Norway as a country to invest in. The government cut tariffs shortly after the four investors bought their stakes in Gassled in 2011 and 2012 from ExxonMobil , Total, Statoil and Royal Dutch Shell for a total of 32 billion crowns. The hearing is expected to last eight days. $1 = 8.0815 Norwegian crowns

2018-05-23,"PARIS (Reuters) - The U.S. decision to scrap the Iran nuclear deal and implement a tough strategy on the country will strengthen Tehran’s hardliners and endanger the region as a whole, France’s foreign minister said on Wednesday.   Jean-Yves Le Drian was speaking two days after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington would impose “the strongest sanctions in history” if Iran did not curb its regional influence and limit its ballistic missile programme. “We disagree with the method because this collection of sanctions, which will be set up against Iran, will not enable dialogue and on the contrary it will reinforce the conservatives and weaken President (Hassan) Rouhani. This posture risks endangering the region more,” Le Drian told France Inter radio.    He said Paris shared Washington’s concerns over Iran’s ballistic missile “frenzy” and regional hegemonic ambitions, but that the 2015 nuclear deal was the best chance of stopping Tehran developing a nuclear bomb. Deputy foreign ministers of the remaining parties to the accord - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - will meet their Iranian counterpart on Friday in Vienna. The meeting will assess what can be done to keep the deal and circumvent extraterritorial American sanctions that are already impacting foreign business appetite for Iran. European companies say they are worried about getting caught up in the new U.S. sanctions, given the extent of Washington’s global reach, and some have already started pulling out.  “We have another problem which is the security of our companies and the capacity to give Iran the economic benefits that it can expect in return for giving up on nuclear weapons,” Le Drian said. “These (U.S.) sanctions are not acceptable. We can’t allow them to become legitimate.” Reporting by John Irish, Editing by Geert De Clercq, William Maclean",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-france/update-1-u-s-iran-strategy-reinforces-conservatives-endangers-region-france-idUKL5N1SU1PC,23 May 2018,"The U.S. decision to scrap the

Qadeer Mutfi, a spokesman for the mining ministry in Kabul, confirmed the man’s body had been found, but there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack. A Taliban spokesman denied involvement by the movement, which this year pledged to cooperate with the pipeline because of its importance for Afghanistan’s economic development. The $8-billion TAPI pipeline is intended to transport about 33 billion cubic metres of natural gas a year from Turkmenistan through southern Afghanistan to Pakistan and India. The Taliban pledge of cooperation raised hopes that security problems would not threaten construction work but the area includes wide stretches of lawless territory where groups of gunmen of shifting loyalty operate outside central control.

2018-05-23,"(Refiles to remove extraneous xxx in bullet points) * Rosneft wary of Beijing backlash for drilling of Vietnam block * Drilling projects inside Beijing’s “nine-dash line” highly contentious * China seen unlikely to pressure Russia over drilling By James Pearson and Greg Torode HANOI/HONG KONG, May 23 (Reuters) - Some oil blocks off Vietnam’s sprawling coastline fall within an area of the South China Sea demarcated by China’s “nine-dash line”, the basis for Beijing’s controversial claims to most of the resource-rich waterway. Last week, sources said Rosneft Vietnam BV, a unit of Russian state oil firm Rosneft, was concerned its recent drilling in one such block could upset Beijing. That prompted Vietnam’s foreign ministry to assert the blocks are “entirely under Vietnamese sovereignty and jurisdiction”, and a warning from Beijing to respect its sovereign rights. In March, Vietnam halted an oil drilling project in the nearby “Red Emperor” block following pressure from China. The Red Emperor incident was a “blow to Vietnam’s upstream sector and the government’s bid to develop the offshore oil and gas resources that it is legally entitled to under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea,” according to analysis by risk analysts Verisk Maplecroft. The area is important for Vietnam’s economic development. State-run Vietnam Oil & Gas Group, or PetroVietnam, made up 20 percent of Vietnam’s GDP and 30 percent of Hanoi’s total budget revenue from 1986-2009. Vietnam has between 3.3 billion and 4.4 billion tonnes of crude oil and gas reserves in the waters, according to PetroVietnam, which currently produces 22-33 million tonnes of oil equivalent a year from the blocks. According to consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie, if China’s nine dashes were connected as one continuous line, it would bisect or incorporate 67 of Vietnam’s oil blocks. Four of those blocks are currently producing, with others at varying stages of exploration or development, according to Wood Mackenzie. China’s claims in the South China Sea overlap the exclusive economic zones of Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. Despite fierce diplomatic objections by Beijing, the Philippines sought a ruling in 2016 against China in an arbitration case brought under the UN’s Convention of the Law of Sea. The five international judges handed Manila a sweeping victory which dismissed China’s claims and removed any legal basis for Beijing to create a network of linked territorial and economic seas under its control, legal experts said. Chinese officials, who refused to participate in the case, dismissed it as a farce and have continued to insist on jurisdiction over most of the waterway - although they have not yet defined the line as a continuous one. China and other claimants have previously discussed joint development of energy projects in disputed waters, but have been scuppered by issues over sovereignty. Last month, the Philippines said it was looking to seal a pact with China within a few months to jointly explore for oil and gas in waters claimed by both countries. But while China has been ambiguous about precisely what it claims, the waters around Vietnam’s southeastern oil fields have long been a flash-point. Beijing has often attempted to thwart activity through backroom diplomatic threats and, at times, pressure at sea. Those backroom threats were particularly acute in 2007 and 2008, after which U.S. firm ExxonMobil Corp refused to bow to pressure but British oil giant BP and others withdrew from some blocks. China’s reaction to Rosneft’s drilling will be “quite a test of just how far Beijing is willing to go,” said Ian Storey, a South China Sea expert at Singapore’s ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute. “This is a means for China to try to comprehensively trash, in a practical way, the legal ruling against its claims by the arbitral tribunal back in 2016.” At the same time, Beijing and Moscow had an understanding that they don’t challenge each others’ core interests including the South China Sea, he said. Both Vietnamese and foreign diplomats have described Hanoi’s efforts to lure foreign firms as part of a strategy to counter Chinese pressure by “internationalising” the South China Sea dispute. In May and June 2011, Hanoi lodged formal protests over the actions of Chinese civilian vessels interfering with seismic survey ships, at one point cutting sonar cables towed from a Norwegian-registered ship exploring on contract to PetroVietnam. Tensions spiked in May, 2014 as rival coastguard and fishing fleets clashed at sea in ramming and blocking actions after the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) moved a large deepwater rig to drill test wells in exploration blocks off the Vietnamese central coast. It later withdrew amid large scale protests and riots in Vietnam. Vietnam’s crude oil production that year was 15.53 million tonnes, according to its General Statistics Office. By 2017, its crude oil output had fallen to 13.567 million tonnes - a decrease of 12.6 percent. In April, PetroVietnam said maritime tensions with China will hurt its offshore exploration and production activities in 2018, making the Rosneft drilling particularly important. It was partnership with Russia under which Vietnam began exploiting its oil reserves. With both Vietnam’s gold star and Moscow’s hammer and sickle in its logo, the Vietnam-Soviet Petroleum Joint Venture, “Vietsovpetro”, was created in 1981. Vietsovpetro began to explore Vietnam’s continental shelf and discovered the country’s first oil field, Bach Ho, in 1984. Unlike other nations, Russian oil concerns in the region appear to have been largely left alone, said Moscow-based Southeast Asia analyst Anton Tsvetov of the independent Centre for Strategic Research think-tank. It was unlikely that, beyond official rhetoric, China would directly pressure either Rosneft or the Russian government over the latest Vietnamese drilling, Tsvetov said. “There is a strong relationship between China and Russia right now, and energy issues are high on the agenda, so I think it would be highly unusual for the Chinese to cause a problem for such a large Russian oil company.” Reporting by James Pearson in Hanoi and Greg Torode in Hong

2018-05-23,"* Trump says not pleased by recent trade talks with China * Turkish lira tumbles after rating agency warnings * Oil prices still near 3-1/2-year high on supply concerns * European stocks seen opening lower By Hideyuki Sano and Tomo Uetake TOKYO, May 23 (Reuters) - Asian shares were mostly weaker on Wednesday with investors cautious after U.S. President Donald Trump tempered optimism over progress made in trade talks between the world’s two largest economic powers. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.3 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.2 percent to end at a 1-1/2-week low and the Shanghai Composite Index retreated 1.1 percent. European stock futures   suggest major European share indexes   will open about 0.5 percent lower. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 shed 0.31 percent overnight, losing steam after hitting a two-month high. Trump said on Tuesday he was not pleased with recent trade talks between the United States and China, souring the improved market sentiment following weekend comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that the “trade war” is “on hold”. His remarks followed Beijing’s announcement that it would cut import tariffs for automobiles and car parts. Trump also floated a plan to fine ZTE Corp, and shake up its management as his administration considered rolling back more severe penalties. “The market probably became overly optimistic on Monday. The reality is the talks are still continuing as they haven’t made headway on various issues, including intellectual property,” said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. Further weighing on prices of risk assets, Trump also said there was a “substantial chance” his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will not take place as planned on June 12 amid concerns that Kim is resistant to giving up his nuclear weapons. “There are many uncertainties in the air, we still don’t know whether U.S.-North Korea summit is possible and scandals continued to drag Prime Minister (Shinzo) Abe’s popularity,” said Yasuo Sakuma at Libra Investments. Investors fret Abe’s long-running cronyism scandal could attract more attention as the Ministry of Finance is due to release related documents on Thursday. “Many investors are sitting on the sidelines. Personally, I haven’t done much trading over the past week, after the earnings season. The current price levels are not really attractive. I’m waiting for a 5 percent correction.” The cautious mood helped to underpin bonds. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield stood at 3.050 percent, off Monday’s near seven-year high of 3.128 percent. As lower U.S. yields sap the appetite for the dollar, the euro traded at $1.1765, hovering above Monday’s five-month low of $1.1717. Against the yen the dollar slipped 0.4 percent to 110.49 from Monday’s four-month high of 111.395. The biggest mover in the currency market was the Turkish lira, which fell more than two percent early on Wednesday to a record low of 4.8450 after rating agencies sounded the alarm on Tuesday over plans by President Tayyip Erdogan to tighten his grip on monetary policy. The lira has fallen around 15 percent so far this month. In commodities, oil prices held firm near 3-1/2-year highs on potential supply concerns surrounding Venezuela and Iran. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures traded little changed at $71.95 a barrel, a 0.4 percent loss. They touched $72.83 a barrel, the highest since November 2014, on Tuesday. Brent futures were 0.6 percent lower at $79.11 a barrel. Last week, the global benchmark topped $80 for the first time since November 2014.

This posture risks endangering the region more,” Jean-Yves Le Drian told France Inter radio.

2018-05-23,"MELBOURNE, May 23 (Reuters) - Australia’s biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) producer Woodside Petroleum on Wednesday outlined plans to accelerate and expand its Scarborough gas project off northwestern Australia, now expected to cost $10 billion. Fresh from buying out ExxonMobil Corp to gain control over the Scarborough field, Woodside is looking to start producing gas in 2023, two years earlier than previously flagged, with LNG production from an expanded Pluto plant starting in 2024. First gas would be piped to the North West Shelf LNG plant, operated by Woodside, via a link from the Pluto facility. This meant Woodside would reap revenue on up to 3 million tonnes of LNG one year ahead of completing a second LNG production unit at the Pluto plant, which would then handle Scarborough gas. Woodside also said it has increased the planned size of the second unit, or train, at Pluto to 4-5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), which would double the plant’s capacity. The original plan was for a second train that could produce 2-3.3 mtpa. The expanded plant could take gas from other long stranded fields in the area, which have substantial reserves but no way of getting the gas to market, including fields owned by Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell. As operator of Australia’s biggest LNG plant, North West Shelf LNG, as well as Pluto LNG, Woodside sees other companies relying on it to help them develop remote, deepwater gas fields discovered over the past 40 years to fill what is expected to be a gas supply gap opening up around 2023, as Asian demand soars. “That puts us really in a commanding position as we go forward in dealing with those owners,” Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman said at the company’s annual investor day. Coleman said he was open to talking to other resource owners who could hook into Woodside’s pipelines and LNG plants, but they would need to talk to him by the third quarter of this year, before the company starts design work on the Scarborough project. “They need to stop messing around and give me some offers,” Coleman said.

2018-05-23,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German solar battery maker sonnen has secured 60 million euros (53 million pounds) in funds from Shell Ventures and existing shareholders to expand at home and abroad. Shell Ventures, a unit of the Anglo-Dutch oil major that has been boosting its investments in solar and other renewables, was a lead investor in the latest funding round, sonnen Chief executive Christoph Ostermann told Reuters. “With this money, we can get started on important investment plans, especially in the United States and Australia,” he said, adding that existing shareholders also contributed extra cash. “We also want to invest in broadening our sonnen community and our virtual power plant (VPP), and expand our offering of grid-related services,” the sonnen CEO said, adding that the firm aimed to turn a profit in Germany in two years. The company provides battery storage systems to households with rooftop solar panels and links up home-produced electricity to other solar users in Germany, Europe’s biggest solar market.  The company — which also operates in Italy, France, Australia, Austria, Britain and the United States — provides hardware and software to customers seeking more independence from power markets dominated by big utilities generating most of their electricity from fossil fuels. So far, sonnen has sold 30,000 batteries worldwide with combined capacity for 210 megawatts. This only equates to a small fossil-fuel power plant but it has potential to expand as storage becomes cheaper and generation becomes less centralised. The company has teamed up with grid companies to help iron out imbalances in transmission networks by aggregating battery owners to operate as a single “virtual” power plant. In 2016, sonnen received 76 million euros from investors, including China’s Envision. Ostermann said the 76 million euros plus the latest funding round would cover investment for the next two years. “It is important for us to have leg room, as we are a growth company and need to develop,” he said. Other sonnen investors include Germany’s eCapital and MVP, Dutch firm SET Ventures, Czech company Inven Capital, and GE Ventures, a unit of U.S. firm General Electric. The investment from Shell, which operates in 140 countries, would help sonnen expand into new areas, Ostermann said. The company boosted turnover by 65 percent to 65 million euros in 2017, outpacing growth in German solar battery sales of 30 percent, Ostermann said, adding that a stock market listing (IPO) was a possibility but was not on the immediate horizon.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.2 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei lost as much as 1.4 percent to hit a 1-1/2-week low and the Shanghai Composite Index retreated 0.6 percent. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 shed 0.31 percent overnight, losing steam after hitting a two-month high. Trump said on Tuesday he was not pleased with recent trade talks between the United States and China, souring the improved market sentiment following weekend comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that the “trade war” is “on hold”. His remarks followed Beijing’s announcement that it would cut import tariffs for automobiles and car parts. Trump also floated a plan to fine ZTE Corp, and shake up its management as his administration considered rolling back more severe penalties. “The market probably became overly optimistic on Monday. The reality is the talks are still continuing as they haven’t made headway on various issues, including intellectual property,” said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. Further weighing on prices of risk assets, Trump also said there was a “substantial chance” his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will not take place as planned on June 12 amid concerns that Kim is resistant to giving up his nuclear weapons. “There are many uncertainties in the air, we still don’t know whether U.S.-North Korea summit is possible and scandals continued to drag Prime Minister (Shinzo) Abe’s popularity,” said Yasuo Sakuma at Libra Investments. Investors fret Abe’s long-running cronyism scandal could attract more attention as the Ministry of Finance is due to release related documents on Thursday. “Many investors are sitting on the sidelines. Personally, I haven’t done much trading over the past week, after the earnings season. The current price levels are not really attractive. I’m waiting for a 5 percent correction.” The cautious mood helped to underpin bonds. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield stood at 3.054 percent, off Monday’s near seven-year high of 3.128 percent. As lower U.S. yields sap the appetite for the dollar, the euro traded at $1.1754, hovering above Monday’s five-month low of $1.1717. Against the yen the dollar slipped 0.4 percent to 110.47 from Monday’s four-month high of 111.395. The biggest mover in the currency market was the Turkish lira, which fell more than two percent early on Wednesday to a record low of 4.8450 after rating agencies sounded the alarm on Tuesday over plans by President Tayyip Erdogan to tighten his grip on monetary policy. The lira has fallen almost 15 percent so far this month. In commodities, oil prices held firm near 3-1/2-year highs on potential supply concerns surrounding Venezuela and Iran. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures traded little changed at $72.01 a barrel, a 0.26 percent loss. They touched $72.83 a barrel, the highest since November 2014, on Tuesday.

Thermal coal futures fell to 588.8 yuan ($92.37) per tonne by 0250 GMT, extending a more than 3 percent fall in the overnight trading session as investors rushed to close out long positions and pile on short bets. Reuters reported on Tuesday that China’s state planner ordered utilities this week to stop stockpiling thermal coal and told miners to slash prices, citing sources, in the government’s first direct intervention since mid-2016. Total open interest for September contracts rose to 415,108 lots, or 41.5 million tonnes, from 400,336 lots on Tuesday. In a meeting with utilities, miners and port officials, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) encouraged utilities to halt buying in the next two to three weeks or reduce inventories. The NDRC also asked miners to bring spot coal prices back under 570 yuan ($90) per tonne by June 10, from current levels of as much as 650 yuan per tonne, the sources said. Some traders worried that the direct intervention could cause problems further out as summer approaches and power consumption rises. “NDRC has ordered power plants to stop buying coal as of now. But pent-up demand from this month and expectation of tight rail transportation capacity in summer could lead to supply crunches,” a coal trader based in Hefei, southern Anhui province said.

Brent futures dipped 4 cents to $79.53 a barrel by 0006 GMT, after climbing 35 cents on Tuesday. Last week, the global benchmark hit $80.50 a barrel, the highest since November 2014.

The OPEC-led supply curbs have largely cleared an inventory surplus in industrialized countries based on the deal’s original goals, and stocks continue to decline. Rising supply in the United States, where shale production is forecast to hit a record high in June, has limited the upward move in prices. Concerns about a potential drop in Iranian oil exports following Washington’s exit from a nuclear arms control deal with Tehran have driven prices to multi-year highs.

2018-05-23,"(Repeats without change. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chart 1: tmsnrt.rs/2LkQO6q * Chart 2: tmsnrt.rs/2Ln8DBI By John Kemp LONDON, May 22 (Reuters) - Hedge funds are rolling forward long positions in the Brent futures contract, and in the absence of offsetting factors this is depressing the value of expiring contracts, pushing futures prices into contango. Since the end of June 2017 hedge funds and other money managers have built up a near-record net long position in Brent in the expectation that prices will continue to rise. Hedge funds held long futures and options positions equivalent to almost 615 million barrels on May 15, according to position reports published by the Intercontinental Exchange. These were partially offset by short positions amounting to 66 million barrels, giving a net long of almost 549 million barrels. Fund managers also held 374 million barrels of positions in the calendar spreads, offsetting long and short positions in different contract months. Some positions were held in the form of options, but most were futures, with a net long position in futures alone amounting to 519 million barrels. For the Brent contract as a whole, the total number of open positions in futures across all maturities and all market participants was equivalent to 2,704 million barrels. Of all the open positions, almost 44 percent were concentrated in the first three contracts expiring in July 2018 (437 million barrels), August 2018 (463 million barrels) and September 2018 (281 million barrels). Unless the hedge fund positions were distributed very differently to other market participants, a substantial number must have been held in the first three months (tmsnrt.rs/2LkQO6q). In fact, many fund managers, especially those following momentum-based strategies, have a strong preference for liquidity, so they tend to hold their position in the closest and most liquid contract months. But as those contracts approach expiry, positions must be rolled forward or allowed to terminate automatically with the passage of time (tmsnrt.rs/2Ln8DBI). Chart 1: tmsnrt.rs/2LkQO6q Chart 2: tmsnrt.rs/2Ln8DBI The rolling forward of long positions tends to push the front end of the futures curve from backwardation towards contango because they involve the simultaneous sale of a near-term contract and purchase of one further forward. Of course, for every long position there is a short, and the rolling of short positions tends to have the opposite effect, pushing the market from contango towards backwardation. In theory, the impact of rolling forward long and short positions should be neutral. In practice, different groups of market participants employ different strategies and have a different impact on price formation. Hedge funds and other money managers tend to be dynamic price-makers rather than passive price-takers because they trade on expectations of where prices will move in future. The sheer number of hedge fund long positions already established in the market and needing to be rolled forward each month is now weighing on prices at the front end of the curve. While fund managers were still accumulating net longs between June 2017 and March 2018, the negative impact on near-term calendar spreads was masked by the amount of new buying each month. But hedge funds have been reducing their net position in Brent since the middle of April. The net position has been cut by 84 million barrels, or 13 percent, since April 10. If the problem of rolled longs persists, many more hedge funds are likely to try to escape it by shifting positions further along the curve towards contracts expiring in 2019 or 2020.

A year after hosting Putin in the regal halls of the Chateau de Versailles, Macron wants to find common ground on Syria and Ukraine during his two-day visit, while opening a broader dialogue on Iran after President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal. “The weakness of the transatlantic relationship does not give Macron sufficiently strong positions to counter Putin,” said Tatiana Kastoueva-Jean, director of the Russia centre at the Paris-based Institute for International Relations. “Putin knows that there are differences in the Western camp and as soon as someone shows weakness he exploits it.” Macron has bet on nurturing relationships with leaders such as Putin to appear engaged but non-committal, trying to mediate among the sides without unsettling anyone. That policy is now being tested after Trump shunned his closest allies and slapped on extraterritorial sanctions on Iran, having already pulled out of the global climate pact and threatened the EU with tariffs on metals. The U.S. move has left Paris, London and Berlin scrambling to salvage the nuclear deal knowing full well that their interests are not necessarily aligned with the two remaining signatories - Russia and China. Macron hopes to entice all sides into a grand bargain that would tackle Iran’s nuclear programme and also address fears over its ballistic missile activity and regional influence as a means to bringing the United States back into the fold. “A lot needs to be done to convince the Russians because it has interests in the Middle East, especially Syria, and its stance towards the West is aggressive,” said a senior French diplomat. Rather than directly confronting Putin publicly, Macron has emphasised private dialogue, while pushing for a restoration of business and cultural ties despite existing European Union sanctions on Moscow. Invited as guest of honour to an economic forum that will be attended by the likes of French oil major Total, Macron will on Friday at least trumpet improved trade ties that have seen French exports steadily recover after a drop in 2015. But the strategy as a whole has shown its limits. Over the last year Moscow has not altered its positions in Syria, where it continues to back President Bashar al-Assad militarily, or in Ukraine, where just last week Putin again excluded ever restoring annexed Crimea. Yet even after Britain accused Russia of orchestrating a nerve-gas attack on its soil - further souring EU-Russia ties - Macron has continued to stress that despite differences, ostracising Moscow would not yield results. “I felt the eagerness of this dynamic young and ambitious man to quickly find concrete solutions, but alas in life it is a little more complicated. The solution in Syria as in Ukraine depends not only on us or the French, but other actors,” former Russian ambassador to France Alexander Orlov told Reuters. “But nevertheless there is this positive approach on the part of President Macron ... and he is ready to cooperate with Russia to find solutions.” Few see any likelihood of a breakthrough on the Ukraine crisis. However, French diplomats hope that the potential for a direct confrontation between Israel and Iran in Syria and the lack of a political transition process in the country will encourage Putin to yield some ground. But highlighting just how one-sided Macron’s efforts have been, he sent at least two letters to Putin - one last summer and one at the end of the year - outlining concrete areas in which he believed Putin could pressure Assad to ease humanitarian access in the war-torn country. Neither drew clear responses. “Beyond France’s prestige and commercial opportunities, an effective French diplomacy must ask what levers it can use vis-à-vis recalcitrant actors,” said Jalel Harchaoui, a geopolitics researcher at Paris 8 University. “It seems this basic question is no longer being asked in Paris. “When you conduct foreign policy without a carrot or a stick, that’s what you get.” (Additional reporting by Marine Pennetier; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/russia-france-macron/preview-trump-factor-leaves-macron-scrambling-ahead-of-russia-trip-idUKL5N1ST63P,23 May 2018,"Emmanuel Macron heads to St

2018-05-23,"* Energy ministry seeks Duterte help to tap nuclear energy * Philippines has the only nuclear plant in Southeast Asia * Completed in 1984 after cost blowout, plant was never used * Country’s power demand expected to triple by 2040 By Manolo Serapio Jr and Enrico Dela Cruz MORONG, Philippines/MANILA, May 23 (Reuters) - Filipino Wilfredo Torres was hired as a technician for Southeast Asia’s only nuclear power plant in the 1980s, but has spent the past decade giving guided tours at the never-used facility. The Philippines splashed out $2.3 billion on the 621-megawatt Bataan Nuclear Power Plant, but mothballed it after the collapse of a dictatorship and the devastating Chernobyl disaster. Now, there’s a chance that Torres, 56, might get to see the plant in action before he retires in four years. As power demand soars in one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, the Philippines’ energy ministry is looking seriously again at nuclear power and urging President Rodrigo Duterte to fast-track its revival. “There’s still a few of us who have been here from the start who are hoping to see the plant running before we retire,” said Torres during a tour of the facility, nearly 200km (125 miles) northwest of Manila. The Department of Energy has asked Duterte for an executive order declaring the Philippines ready for a nuclear power programme, said Gerardo Erguiza, energy assistant secretary. “With the need for cheaper, reliable power, nuclear is ideal,” Erguiza told Reuters. “It’s a template in successful economies.” Previous attempts to pursue nuclear energy in the Philippines have failed due to safety concerns and because central to the plan is the revival of the Bataan plant, built during dictator Ferdinand Marcos’ rule. Marcos ordered the Bataan nuclear plant built in 1976 in response to an energy crisis, convinced nuclear energy was the solution to the Middle East oil embargo of the early 1970s. Completed in 1984, the government mothballed it two years later following Marcos’ ouster and the deadly Chernobyl nuclear disaster. From 2009, the government opened the plant to tourists for a fee, helping defray the cost of maintaining it, along with an annual state budget that this year was 32 million Philippine pesos ($612,000). While reopening the Westinghouse-built Bataan plant is an option, so is building a new nuclear facility, said Erguiza, acknowledging the former will “open up so many wounds” after costs came in more than four times the initial budget. Coal fuels half of the Philippines’ power grid, with natural gas and renewables each accounting for over a fifth and oil the rest. With an economy growing as fast as China’s - at 6.8 percent in the first quarter - Manila expects energy consumption to triple to 67,000 MW by 2040. By tapping nuclear - where upfront investment is high but fuel costs are lower - electricity costs will drop, said Carlo Arcilla, director of the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute. “The biggest issue in the Philippines is that we have one of the most expensive power in the world,” he said. Philippine power rates, which are not state-subsidised, were ranked the 16th most expensive out of 44 countries surveyed in a 2016 study commissioned by power retailer Manila Electric Co . Japan topped the list. Nuclear reactor builders Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co Ltd and Russia’s Rosatom submitted plans last year to rehabilitate the Bataan plant, at costs ranging from $1 billion to more than $3 billion, said engineer Mauro Marcelo who oversaw the maintenance and preservation of the plant before he retired in March. Other companies that have expressed interest include China’s top nuclear power plant builder, China Nuclear Engineering and Construction, and Belgium’s Tractebel, said Marcelo. Rehabilitating the Bataan plant would be the shortest nuclear route for the Philippines, taking about five years all up, versus about a decade for a new plant, said Marcelo. “In my view, the nuclear policy may be issued during Duterte’s term,” said Marcelo. “But to start the Bataan plant, I think it’s still a long way to go.” Duterte has said safety will be his top consideration in deciding whether the country will pursue nuclear energy. Opposition to reviving Manila’s nuclear ambitions remains strong, with advocates citing a reliance on imported uranium, high waste and decommissioning costs, as well as safety concerns. Geologist Kelvin Rodolfo has repeatedly warned against the activation of the Bataan plant, saying it sits on an active earthquake fault that runs through a volcano, currently dormant. “A nuclear accident there would affect a much larger area than the Philippines alone, and so the Philippines cannot make the decision to activate (it) all by itself,” said Rodolfo. He would like to see the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) make that judgment. “I have every confidence that they would not approve it,” Rodolfo said. IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano met with Philippine energy officials in February to discuss Manila’s possible nuclear plans. An IAEA review mission to the Philippines is planned later this year. In the wake of Japan’s Fukushima disaster, the number of construction starts of nuclear reactors dropped from a high of 15 in 2010 to four last year - all in Asia, according to the World Nuclear Industry Status Report. “Nuclear is very controversial and if we ever wanted to install it in the Philippines, it would not succeed without very strong intervention by the government,” said Antonio Moraza, president of Aboitiz Power, one of the country’s biggest power producers.
