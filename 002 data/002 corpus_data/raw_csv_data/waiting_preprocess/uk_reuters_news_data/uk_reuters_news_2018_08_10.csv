2018-08-10,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Iran test-fired a short-range anti-ship missile in the Strait of Hormuz during naval drills last week that Washington believes were aimed at sending a message as the United States reimposes sanctions on Tehran, a U.S. official said on Friday. The official, however, did not suggest that such a missile test was unusual during naval exercises or that it was carried out unsafely, noting it occurred in what could be described as Iranian territorial waters in the Strait. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards confirmed on Sunday it had held war games in the Gulf over the past several days, saying they were aimed at “confronting possible threats” by enemies. U.S. Army General Joseph Votel, head of the U.S. military’s Central Command, said earlier this week the scope and scale of the exercises were similar to ones Iran had carried out in the past. But the timing of this particular set of exercises was designed to get Washington’s attention. “It’s pretty clear to us that they were trying to use that exercise to send a message to us that as we approach this period of the sanctions here, that they had some capabilities,” Votel told reporters at the Pentagon. Iran has been furious over U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of an international agreement on Iran’s nuclear program and re-impose sanctions on Tehran. Senior Iranian officials have warned the country would not easily yield to a renewed U.S. campaign to strangle Iran’s vital oil exports. Last month, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei backed President Hassan Rouhani’s suggestion that Iran may block Gulf oil exports if its own exports are stopped. Votel said the U.S. military was keenly aware of Iran’s military activities. “We are aware of what’s going on, and we remain ready to protect ourselves as we pursue our objectives of freedom of navigation and the freedom of commerce in international waters,” Votel said.

2018-08-10,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude oil prices rose more than 1.0 percent on Friday as U.S. sanctions against Iran looked set to tighten supply, but futures contracts posted a weekly decline as investors worried that global trade disputes could slow economic growth and hurt demand for energy. Benchmark Brent crude oil LCOc1 settled 74 cents higher at $72.96 a barrel on Friday. U.S. light crude CLc1 was 82 cents higher at $67.63 a barrel.  A sell-off on Wednesday left both benchmarks down for the week overall, with Brent off 0.5 percent and U.S. crude 1.2 percent lower.  Hedge funds and other money managers cut their bullish positions on U.S. crude in the week ending Aug. 7 to the lowest level since June, data showed on Friday. Prices are expected to remain under pressure as U.S. gasoline demand slows going into the autumn and refiners shut for maintenance, pushing more crude into storage, said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital in New York. “I think it now comes down to the point of what we see in demand numbers.”  U.S. crude supplies fell less than expected in the latest week, and data released on Friday showed U.S. energy companies this week added the most oil rigs since May. Drillers added 10 oil rigs in the week to Aug. 10, bringing the total to 869, the most since March 2015, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI [RIG/U] Escalating trade disputes between the U.S, China and other countries have dimmed the outlook for economic growth and boosted the U.S. dollar, making oil more expensive for consumers using other currencies. Currencies of major emerging economies including China, India and Turkey have slumped. Despite these worries, prices got a boost from U.S. sanctions against Iran, which from November will affect oil exports from that country. Although the European Union, China and India oppose the U.S.  sanctions against Iran, many are expected to bow to U.S. pressure. Analysts expect Iranian crude exports to fall by between 500,000 and 1.3 million barrels per day, with buyers in Japan, South Korea and India already dialing back orders.  The reduction will depend on whether buyers of Iranian oil receive waivers that would allow some imports. The International Energy Agency said on Friday the oil market could see more turbulence. “The recent cooling down of the market, with short-term supply tensions easing, currently lower prices, and lower demand growth might not last,” the IEA said in a monthly report. “As oil sanctions against Iran take effect, perhaps in combination with production problems elsewhere, maintaining global supply might be very challenging.” Investors are wary of the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing. In the latest round of levies, China said it would impose additional tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of U.S. imports. Although crude oil was removed from the list, replaced by refined products and liquefied petroleum gas, analysts say Chinese imports of U.S. crude will fall significantly.

2018-08-10,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - A plunge in the Turkish lira rocked global equities and emerging markets on Friday and fear of further fallout sent investors scurrying for safety in assets like the yen and U.S. government bonds. European shares and a gauge of global equity markets closed down more than 1 percent, while Wall Street also fell, though not as much. Germany’s DAX index slid 2 percent.  The lira fell as much as 18 percent against the dollar in its worst day since Turkey’s financial crisis of 2001. The plunge followed a deepening rift with the United States, worries about its own economy and lack of action from policymakers. President Tayyip Erdogan told Turks to swap gold and dollars into lira as the currency tumbled after President Donald Trump doubled U.S. tariffs on metals imports from Turkey. Turkey later warned the United States that sanctions and pressure would only serve to harm ties between the two NATO allies, adding Ankara would continue to retaliate as necessary against U.S. tariffs. The lira has fallen more than 40 percent this year, fanning worries about a full-blown economic crisis.  ((Graphic: Turkish lira: reut.rs/2MeTRjH)) Bank shares across Europe fell and the euro slipped to its lowest since July 2017 as the Financial Times quoted sources as saying the European Central Bank was concerned about European lenders’ exposure to Turkey. The country is not a member of the European Union but is economically linked to it. The dollar rose as exposure to Turkey could impact European banks and spark a domino effect as people begin to pull out of those banks and into U.S. assets, said Gregan Anderson, macroeconomic strategist at brokerage Bulltick LLC. The flare-up in tensions has made it difficult for global investors to justify remaining in Europe and is negative for emerging markets, he said. Policy errors created the current situation, with Turkey’s central bank decision not to raise rates in their last meeting a key driver, said Charlie Wilson, an emerging markets-focused portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, New Mexico. “The lira has been weakening since and it’s coming to a head today,” Wilson said, adding the downward spiral will continue if Turkey insists on a soft landing.   “The only way to correct these policy mistakes is to really make some concrete changes on the fiscal and monetary side.” Shares in France’s BNP Paribas, Italy’s UniCredit and Spain’s BBVA, the banks seen as most exposed to Turkey, fell 3 percent or more. An index of regional banking shares closed down 3.2 percent while the pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 1.07 percent. The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 1.22 percent and erased all its gains for the week.  Wall Street also fell.

Investors piled into “safe” government debt, with German yields hitting three-week lows and the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note falling to 2.8750 percent as investors sought its safety.  The safe-haven Japanese yen hit a one-month high of 113.38 against the dollar, and was last traded at 110.91. The dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a group of six major currencies, breached 96, taking it to its highest level since July 2017. It was last up 0.84 percent at 96.309. Emerging market stocks lost 1.66 percent, while the Mexican peso, a proxy for emerging market currencies, shed 1.29 percent to the dollar.

2018-08-10,"(Adds rig count in the Permian basin) NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies this week added the most oil rigs since May as drillers follow though on plans to spend more on exploration and production in anticipation of higher crude prices in 2018 than recent years. Drillers added 10 oil rigs in the week to Aug. 10, bringing the total count to 869, the highest level since March 2015, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI That rig count increase occurred despite U.S. crude prices falling for a sixth week in a row for the first time since August 2015 on worries trade tensions between the United States and China could hurt oil demand. More than half the total oil rigs are in the Permian basin in west Texas and eastern New Mexico, the nation’s biggest shale oil field. Active units there increased by six to 485, the most since January 2015. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 768 rigs were active as energy companies have been ramping up production in anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than previous years. So far this year, U.S. oil futures have averaged $66.28 per barrel. That compares with averages of $50.85 in 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading near $67 for the balance of 2018 and over $64 for calendar 2019 . In anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than 2017, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks, including Anadarko Petroleum Corp, Apache Corp and Cabot Oil and Gas Corp, have provided guidance indicating an 18 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. In recent weeks, Anadarko, Apache, Cabot and other energy firms have boosted the amount of capital they plan to spend on drilling and completions in 2018. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks now expect to spend a total of $85.2 billion in 2018, up from an estimate of $83.6 billion last week. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,032 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020, the same as last week. Since 1,057 oil and gas rigs were already in service, drillers would only have to add a handful of rigs during the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. So far this year, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,012. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) this month projected average annual U.S. production will rise to a record high 10.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 and 11.7 million bpd in 2019 from 9.4 million bpd in 2017. The current all-time U.S. annual output peak was in 1970 at 9.6 million bpd, according to federal energy data. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-08-10,"(Updates with closing prices, adds details) By Mark Weinraub CHICAGO, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Agriculture Department on Friday raised its outlook for domestic corn and soybean harvests by a more than expected amount due to good weather during key phases of development. The increased domestic projections, which pushed futures markets sharply lower, will boost the U.S. soybean stockpile to its biggest ever while a trade war with China threatens to shut off the top market for the oilseed. “The bean number is so unbelievably large,” said Mark Gold with Top Third Ag Marketing. “If we don’t do a trade deal with the Chinese, the American farmer is going to be in dire straits.” Chicago Board of Trade soybean futures sank 4.8 percent, the biggest daily decline for the most-active contract in three years. CBOT corn futures were 3 percent lower. The government’s closely watched supply and demand report pegged U.S. soybean production and corn yields at all-time records. USDA also lowered its outlook for global wheat production and supplies as hot and dry conditions crippled harvest prospects in the European Union. USDA boosted its outlook for 2018/19 soybean exports to 2.060 billion bushels after sharply cutting them in July. But soybean exports were still expected to fall below the 2017/18 total. Corn harvest for the 2018/2019 crop year was seen at 14.586 billion bushels, the third-biggest ever. Yields were raised 4.4 bushels per acre to 178.4 bushels per acre, which would top the previous record of 176.6 set a year ago. Analysts had been expecting a corn harvest of 14.411 billion bushels and average yields of 176.2 bushels per acre, according to the average of estimates given in a Reuters poll. USDA predicted soybean production for the 2018/19 crop year at 4.586 billion bushels, with average yields coming in at 51.6 bushels per acre. Both the yield and production outlooks topped the high end of market forecasts. If realized, U.S. soybean production would top Brazil’s harvest. Brazil had been expected to take over the mantle as the world’s largest soybean producer for the first time this year. “From a U.S. standpoint, it’s supply-bearish,” said Don Roose, president of U.S. Commodities. “There’s just not a lot of bullishness to talk about.” Soybean end stocks were forecast at 430 million bushels for the 2017/18 marketing year and 785 million bushels for 2018/19. For corn, 2017/18 end stocks were seen at 2.027 billion bushels and 2018/19 end stocks were seen at 1.684 billion bushels.

2018-08-10,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to double tariffs on steel and aluminum from Turkey could push up costs even further for domestic oil and gas pipeline projects, as energy executives said they were already struggling from earlier tariff rises.  There are more than a dozen U.S. energy pipelines on the drawing board, some of which are still seeking financing. The projects would pave the way for greater U.S. oil and gas exports and relieve a bottleneck in West Texas shale fields that is starting to pinch output in the region. Turkey delivers just 4 percent of steel mill imports, valued about $1.18 billion last year, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. But doubling tariffs on a supplier could force buyers to turn to other steel makers and, in turn, lift steel prices that have already ballooned in recent months.  On Friday, Trump authorized a doubling of tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum imports - to 50 percent and 20 percent, respectively - ratcheting up a diplomatic dispute with the NATO-member country. The Trump administration’s original move in March to raise tariffs on most steel and aluminum imports was proposed to safeguard U.S. jobs against overseas rivals. That had already added $40 million to the cost of a Plains All American (PAA.N) crude oil pipeline that will use steel supplied by a Greek company, Plains executives said.  “We are moving forward with the project, but believe that imposing a tax on pre-existing orders is unjust, especially considering the specific materials we purchased abroad were not readily available in the U.S.,” Willie Chiang, Plains’ chief operating officer, said on Tuesday. The trade actions “threaten important energy infrastructure projects,” said Catherine Landry, a vice president at trade group Interstate Natural Gas Association of America. Companies were “being unfairly punished for participating in international trade,” she said. Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N), the second largest North American pipeline operator, had already ordered nearly half of the specialized pipe needed for its Gulf Coast Express project from Turkish steel maker Borusan Mannesmann (BRSAN.IS) before the original tariff went into effect, spokeswoman Sara Hughes said. The Houston-based company on Friday declined to comment on the impact on the project of the doubling of the tariff. The $1.75 billion Gulf Coast Express is a natural gas line being constructed from West Texas to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Kinder Morgan had applied to the U.S. Commerce Department for an exemption to the original, 25 percent tariff but had not yet received a decision, the spokeswoman added. Alan Madison, a spokesman for Borusan Mannesmann’s U.S. subsidiary, said the company and its Turkish parent were still studying Trump’s new proposal and declined to comment further. The Turkish currency fell more than 18 percent on Friday, increasing its costs to import raw materials, but making exports relatively cheaper.  “The Turks can export to many other countries, but with a weak lira, their products become cheaper to buy. The cheap lira actually can help increase their export volume,” said George Gero, a managing director at RBC Wealth Management who follows metals markets.  Steel futures on Friday were up 1 percent at $907 per ton on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but are up 46 percent from $621 per ton a year ago.

2018-08-10,"NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies this week added the most oil rigs since May as drillers follow though on plans to spend more on exploration and production in anticipation of higher crude prices in 2018 than recent years. Drillers added 10 oil rigs in the week to Aug. 10, bringing the total count to 869, the highest level since March 2015, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI That rig count increase occurred desite U.S. crude prices being on track to fall for a sixth week in a row for the first time since August 2015 on worries trade tensions between the United States and China could hurt oil demand. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 768 rigs were active as energy companies have been ramping up production in anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than previous years. So far this year, U.S. oil futures have averaged $66.28 per barrel. That compares with averages of $50.85 in 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading near $67 for the balance of 2018 and over $64 for calendar 2019 . In anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than 2017, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks, including Anadarko Petroleum Corp, Apache Corp and Cabot Oil and Gas Corp, have provided guidance indicating an 18 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. In recent weeks, Anadarko, Apache, Cabot and other energy firms have boosted the amount of capital they plan to spend on drilling and completions in 2018. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks now expect to spend a total of $85.2 billion in 2018, up from an estimate of $83.6 billion last week. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,032 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020, the same as last week. Since 1,057 oil and gas rigs were already in service, drillers would only have to add a handful of rigs during the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. So far this year, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,012. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) this month projected average annual U.S. production will rise to a record high 10.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 and 11.7 million bpd in 2019 from 9.4 million bpd in 2017. The current all-time U.S. annual output peak was in 1970 at 9.6 million bpd, according to federal energy data. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-08-10,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Russia largely failed in its bid to overturn the European Union’s gas market rules in a World Trade Organization ruling published on Friday. Russia launched the dispute in 2014, claiming that the EU’s “Third Energy Package” and the EU’s energy policy overall unfairly restricted and discriminated against Russia’s gas export monopoly Gazprom (GAZP.MM). Russia argued that the EU broke WTO rules by requiring the “unbundling” of gas transmission assets and production and supply assets, which effectively stopped Gazprom - long the major supplier of gas to Europe - from owning the pipelines through which it sent gas to the European market. Russia said the EU had unfairly discriminated in favour of liquefied natural gas and upstream pipeline operators by exempting them from those unbundling requirements. The panel of three WTO adjudicators ruled against Russia on those points.  However, they upheld Russia’s complaint about an unbundling exemption for Germany’s OPAL pipeline, granted on condition that Gazprom supplied no more than 50 percent of the gas in the pipeline. The 50 percent cap could only be exceeded if 3 billion cubic metres of gas was released annually at a fixed price to competing suppliers on the Czech market. The WTO panel also agreed that Croatia, Hungary and Lithuania had discriminated against Russia by requiring a security of energy supply assessment for foreign, but not domestic, pipeline operators. The European Commission called the ruling an important positive outcome that secured the core elements of the Third Energy Package, a 2009 reform that sought to integrate the EU’s energy market while increasing competition. “The Commission will now analyse the ruling in detail, in particular as regards a limited number of issues on which the WTO-compatibility of EU energy policy has still not been recognised,” it said in a statement. Russia’s Economy Ministry said the parts of the ruling that went in its favour would help to improve access for Russian gas on the European market, and to level the playing field for pipeline service providers.  “This is a positive precedent that makes it possible to change the norms that created obstacles for Russian suppliers in the EU market, both in EU legislation and in the legislation of its individual member countries,” it said in a statement. Gazprom said it had always said that European energy policy should take gas suppliers’ interests into account, and therefore it was satisfied with the points where Russia had won.   Either side can appeal within 60 days.

2018-08-10,"* Turkish lira plunges to record low * FT reports ECB worried about European bank exposure to Turkey * Bank shares fall * Euro falls to lowest since July 2017 * Yen climbs, bond yields fall By Herbert Lash and Ritvik Carvalho NEW YORK/LONDON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - A plunge in the Turkish lira rocked global equities and emerging markets on Friday and fear of more turmoil sent investors scurrying for safety in assets like the yen and U.S. government bonds. The lira fell as much as 18 percent against the dollar in its worst day since Turkey’s financial crisis of 2001. It followed a deepening rift with the United States, worries about its own economy and lack of action from policymakers. President Tayyip Erdogan told Turks to exchange gold and dollars into lira as the currency tumbled after President Donald Trump doubled U.S. tariffs on metals imports from Turkey. The currency has fallen more than 40 percent this year, fanning worries about a full-blown economic crisis. Bank shares across Europe fell and the euro slipped to its lowest since July 2017 as the Financial Times quoted sources as saying the European Central Bank was concerned about European lenders’ exposure to Turkey. The dollar rose as exposure to Turkey could impact European banks and spark a domino effect throughout Europe as people begin to pull out of those banks and into the U.S., said Gregan Anderson, macroeconomic strategist at brokerage Bulltick LLC. The turmoil makes it difficult for global investors to justify remaining in Europe and it is also negative for emerging markets. “In that sense, the Turkey situation can be a contagion not only in Europe but across emerging markets,” Anderson said. Shares in France’s BNP Paribas, Italy’s UniCredit and Spain’s BBVA, the banks seen as most exposed to Turkey, fell 4 percent or more. An index of regional banking shares slid 3.7 percent while the pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 1.2 percent. The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 1.1 percent and erased all its gains for the week. Wall Street opened lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 185.15 points, or 0.73 percent, to 25,324.08. The S&P 500 lost 14.92 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,838.66 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 36.64 points, or 0.46 percent, to 7,855.15. Investors piled into “safe” government debt, with German yields hitting three-week lows and the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note falling to 2.88822 percent.

The dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a group of six major currencies, breached 96, taking it to its highest level since July 2017. It was last up 0.7 percent at 96.173. Adding to emerging market currency woes was the Russian ruble, which weakened to 67.12 to the dollar. Overnight it had retreated to its lowest since November 2016 on threats of new U.S. sanctions, weakening beyond the psychologically important 65-per-dollar threshold. Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho

2018-08-10,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil cut its greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation in 2017 to levels below its internationally agreed 2020 climate change targets, the country’s Environment Ministry said on Thursday.  Brazil reduced its emission from deforestation in the Amazon rainforest by 610 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2), compared to its 2020 target of 564 million tonnes. In the Cerrado savanna, emissions were reduced 170 million tonnes of carbon dioxide versus a target of 104 million tonnes. The Amazon, the world’s largest tropical rainforest, and the Cerrado, South America’s biggest savanna, soak up vast amounts of carbon dioxide and their preservation is seen as vital to the fight against climate change. But destruction of the forest releases large quantities of CO2, one of the main greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming. Large-scale Amazon deforestation has made Brazil one of the world’s top greenhouse gas emitters, due to fires and the spread of agriculture and cattle ranching. The 2020 emission goals were set out in the 2009 Copenhagen Accord to combat climate change. Under the more ambitious Paris Agreement in 2015 on climate change, Brazil has set goals for further steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for 2025 and 2030. “The policy message is that we can and should remain in the Paris Agreement (because) it is possible to effectively implement the commitments that have been made,” said Thiago Mendes, secretary of climate change in the Environment Ministry.

2018-08-10,"TURKANA, Kenya, Aug 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Kenyan villager Ekeno Pedo never considered that golden fields of sorghum - or indeed any crop - might one day flourish on the outskirts of his village in drought-stricken Turkana county. “From the time I was a small herdsboy in this community I never imagined the possibility of farming in this area given the tough climate and our nomadic lifestyle,” said 65-year-old Pedo. The fields that have sprung up in this vast and arid scrubland in Kenya’s northwest are in part due to the hard work of refugees, who have come here from neighbouring South Sudan, Ethiopia and Uganda in recent decades. Turkana is Kenya’s second-largest county and its poorest, yet in 2015 it donated 1,500 hectares (3,707 acres) of land for the refugee settlement of about 60,000 people near Pedo’s village of Kalobeyei. The idea was to develop an agricultural project that would help bring together the new arrivals and locals. Residents and refugees alike say it has worked well. “Apart from seeing our people marry some of the refugees, they also guide us a lot when it comes to farming, because some of them came from communities that depended on agriculture,” said 50-year-old nomadic pastoralist, Jeremiah Kazimoto. Namuzungu Berta, a refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo, said it was liberating for refugees to grow their own food and earn an income, instead of relying on aid. “With this arrangement, we now have the freedom to choose what to eat, because we can either grow it or buy from the community,” said Berta. The project began as kitchen gardens in 2016, but today it includes 100 hectares of sorghum, a cereal, with large fields subdivided between refugees and the local community, which both harvest and earn money from the crop. When the sorghum ripens, the farmers sell it to aid agencies, which grind it and use it to feed the refugees. “I harvested seven bags of sorghum from my quarter-hectare piece of land, and I sold four of them to the Red Cross at a premium price of 3,000 Kenyan shillings ($30) for a 50-kilogramme bag,” said Jackson Akure Sokona, a resident from nearby Kolioro village. The kitchen gardens and the more recent sorghum crop were part of a 15 million euro ($17.4 million) development project for the area funded by the European Union Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, and implemented by the local authorities and the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The 14-year project, which ends in 2030, aims to provide refugees with sustainable livelihoods through agriculture, while helping them integrate with their host community. It is the first of its kind in Kenya, U.N. officials said. “Due to prolonged political instability in some neighbouring countries, refugees are almost permanent here. So it makes sense to allow them to generate an income alongside the host community,” said Gabriel Rugalema from the FAO in Kenya. “When you allow them to mingle and work together, they get used to each other,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Kenya continues to experience an influx of refugees, the FAO said, which reinforces the need to help them become economically self-sufficient and less dependent on aid. Local authorities say they also hope to avoid complications encountered in 2015 at Kakuma camp, some 40 kilometres away, where the host community felt they did not benefit from the refugees’ presence. The goal at Kalobeyei is for the local community of about 20,000 people to take over the refugees’ small-scale farms if and when they go home, allowing the area to remain productive. “Food security is one of our priorities, and if the refugees can work alongside our communities to produce food locally, then we must support such an initiative,” Turkana deputy governor Peter Emuria Lotethiro told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Turkana’s low rainfall makes farming here challenging. The area is sorely in need of rainwater harvesting techniques such as sand dams and underground water tanks. In addition, its soils and water are saline and struggle to support agriculture, which is why most local people keep livestock - mainly sheep and goats. But technologies like sunken-bed farming and irrigation have enabled them to use stored rainwater to cultivate crops. “We are using proven rainwater harvesting techniques to capitalise on perennial floods in this area whenever it rains,” said Zippy Mbati, a programme officer at the World Food Programme. Community members who take part in the farming project are trained to plant sorghum using a method in which a sand barrier is built in front of the growing area, capturing rainwater and releasing it slowly, the FAO said. Work is underway to expand the area under cultivation: the Turkana government and the FAO are due to set up an irrigation system on a 400-hectare piece of land set aside for farming in Kalobeyei, said FAO field officer Michael Ngututo. This will give 3,500 people enough land to produce about 100 metric tonnes of food worth 100 million Kenyan shillings ($996,000), Ngututo said. Meantime, refugees who have made this arid part of Kenya home said they were glad of the difference the project has made to their lives. “As a refugee, it is very exciting that I am able to grow and feed my children on fresh vegetables,” said Hellen Chebachoge, who was relocated here from Dadaab refugee camp in northeast Kenya earlier this year. “I came from a farming community in Uganda, and so having a kitchen garden makes me feel at home.” Reporting by Isaiah Esipisu.

2018-08-10,"NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - A federal auction of exploration leases in the Gulf of Mexico next week will test energy companies’ appetite for acreage after the Trump administration left royalty rates for deepwater parcels unchanged, bucking an industry call to lower them. The U.S. Gulf of Mexico has faced waning interest in recent years as competition stepped up from other basins globally, as well as from onshore shale basins and Mexico’s waters in the Gulf. Oil companies had lobbied for lower royalty payments for deepwater acreage because of the projects’ high cost and long lead time before production can begin. In February, the Interior Department’s Royalty Policy Committee had recommended lowering the rates. Some companies may have bid on fewer parcels in March’s auction, waiting to see if the Interior Department would cut royalties, said William Turner, a senior research analyst at Wood Mackenzie. In that auction, only 1 percent of the 77 million acres (31.2 million hectares) on offer received bids. Next week’s sale is the first since U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said in April that he would leave deepwater royalty rates unchanged at 18.75 percent, rather than drop them to the 12.5 percent rate for shallow-water parcels. “The uncertainty is gone, it is off the table,” said Imran Khan, senior manager at consultants Wood Mackenzie. The clearer royalty rules may draw companies that held off in March, said Khan and Turner. The auction is likely to draw the largest and smallest Gulf of Mexico participants: companies such Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron Corp on one end, and LLOG, Kosmos Energy and Fieldwood Energy on the other, they said. “If you’re a company like Chevron or Exxon who plays in multiple basins, you have to make sure it is competitive with other basins globally,” said Bob Fryklund, chief upstream strategist at IHS Markit. In the March lease sale, companies largely stuck close to acreage they already held, and did not acquire new territory to explore. “We’re seeing a little bit of a resurgence in the Gulf,” said Fryklund, adding that the rig count has climbed to about 20 rigs from 12 in March. The focus is still on evaluating current acreage rather than looking for new prospects. By 2028, though, IHS expects that pattern to shift slightly with over 100 newfield, wildcat wells expected in the U.S. side of the Gulf.

The lira fell as much as 12 percent against the dollar earlier in the day, its worst day since Turkey’s financial crisis of 2001, on the back of a deepening rift with the United States, worries about its own economy and lack of action from policymakers. The currency is down more than 35 percent this year, its losses accelerating as the dollar jumped to 13-month highs That is spreading fear of an impact on other economies and markets — bank shares across the continent fell and the euro slipped to its lowest since July 2017 as the Financial Times quoted sources as saying the European Central Bank was concerned about European banks’ exposure to Turkey. Shares in France’s BNP Paribas, Italy’s UniCredit and Spain’s BBVA, the banks seen as most exposed to Turkey, fell as much as 4 percent. That took European bank shares down 1.3 percent while the pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.7 percent. The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.6 percent on the day, having erased all its gains for the week. Wall Street was set for a weak open. “People looking at things this morning are much more aware that there is central (major) contagion risk,” said David Owen, chief European economist at Jeffries in London. “Having said that, what’s happening in emerging markets is leading to risk-free rates being bid for and that includes Treasuries, Bunds and gilts.” As investors piled into “safe” bonds, German yields hit three-week lows and yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries fell to 2.8913 percent. Investors are now awaiting the release of the U.S. consumer price inflation for July for clues on the interest rate outlook and to gauge if new import tariffs were starting to have an impact. The data is expected to show inflation likely increased 0.2 percent, after rising 0.1 percent in June. The Australian dollar - often viewed as a proxy for global risk appetite because of its commodity reliance  - was the biggest faller among developed currencies, down 1 percent on the day. Going in the opposite direction was the safe haven Japanese yen, which hit a one-month high against the dollar. The dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a group of six major currencies, breached the 96 level, taking it to its highest level since July 2017. Adding to emerging market currency woes was the Russian rouble, weakened to 67.12 to the dollar. Overnight it had retreated to its lowest since November 2016 on threats of new U.S. sanctions, weakening beyond the psychologically important 65-per-dollar threshold. “Other EM currencies have held their ground against the dollar, having generally been weakening previously,” said analysts at Capital Economics. “In most cases though, we suspect that this resilience will prove temporary,” they said, highlighting expectations of rising U.S. interest rates and worries over growing U.S. protectionism. In commodities, U.S. crude oil fell 0.5 percent to $66.51 a barrel, while Brent crude was 0.4 percent lower at $71.77 per barrel. Despite the broader flight to safe havens, gold was lower. Spot gold fell 0.3 percent to trade at $1,207.15 per ounce.

2018-08-10,"* Billionaire’s 2020 production target seen as ambitious * Government hopes refinery will end need for imports * Construction problems, weather, logistics could delay project By Julia Payne and Libby George LONDON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - A huge oil refinery being built in Nigeria by Africa’s richest man is unlikely to start production until 2022, two years later than the target date, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. The 650,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery near Lagos, set to be Africa’s biggest, is expected to boost Nigeria’s growth and turn the country from an importer of refined products into an exporter, transforming global trade patterns. Billionaire Aliko Dangote, who built his fortune on cement, told Reuters last month he hoped to finish building the refinery in 2019 and to start production in early 2020. However, the sources, who have been on the site many times, said they do not expect gasoline or diesel output before early 2022 and even then, many units at the refinery and accompanying petrochemical plant would not be complete. Dangote Group Executive Director Devakumar Edwin, who oversees the project, described the suggestion that the refinery is unlikely to start production until 2022 as the product of “someone’s wild imagination”. “Ninety-five percent of engineering has been completed, 90 percent of procurement has been completed.” “We started civil works in July last year and we have scheduled 2-1/2 years for mechanical completion,” he said, referring to the point where a plant is ready to be handed over for commissioning. Dangote, who expects the project to cost $12-14 billion, said in July he has raised more than $4.5 billion. “I’ve never seen a refinery of that scale built in two years. It’s highly improbable due to the sequence of events that need to happen, it cannot be fast-tracked safely,” a source advising the Nigerian government said. The sources said a refinery on such a scale would likely need five years to complete and the piling underpinning the plant had only started in the second half of last year and would take some more months to complete. Extra piling was needed to support the plant’s units in the swampy area, causing an unforeseen delay, the sources said. Analysts also anticipate delays owing to the scale of the project in an area with limited infrastructure. “In our forecast, we are putting late 2021 at the earliest for some gasoline production but it may slip to 2022,” said Gary Still, executive director of CITAC, a specialist consulting company focused on African downstream energy. Fuel shortages are common in Nigeria, despite the country of 180 million people being Africa’s biggest oil producer. The existing 445,000 bpd refining system operates well below capacity due to corruption and lack of investment, leaving the state oil firm to import the bulk of its gasoline and gasoil needs paid for with cargoes of crude oil. Edwin told Reuters last month that more than half the plant’s output could be exported after covering domestic needs. The plant will be the world’s largest single-train refinery, meaning it will have only one crude distillation unit (CDU). The government adviser said the CDU would not be ready for commissioning until the third or fourth quarter of 2021 at the earliest, and that process would take about six months. Major pieces of equipment have yet to arrive or are still being constructed overseas. A lack of infrastructure to transport and install oversized equipment and risks from rainy season storms could add unforeseen delays, the government adviser said. The refinery project was first announced in 2013 as a smaller plant to be finished in 2016. A site move to Lekki in Lagos state and a currency crisis caused initial delays. The first producing unit of the fertilizer plant at the same site is complete but the pipeline that was supposed to bring its key input, natural gas, is not finished, meaning that the end-year start would also be missed, two of the sources said.

2018-08-10,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Oil markets have entered a brief period of calm but a storm might be looming later this year when new U.S. sanctions are poised to slash supplies of Iranian oil, the International Energy Agency said on Friday. “The recent cooling down of the market, with short-term supply tensions easing, currently lower prices, and lower demand growth might not last,” the IEA, which oversees the energy policies of industrialized nations, said in a monthly report. Oil prices have rallied close to $80 per barrel, their highest since 2014, on concerns about supply shortages but cooled in recent weeks as Libya regained some lost production and Washington signaled it could give Asian buyers of Iranian oil some exemptions from sanctions for next year. However, the United States said it was still seeking to force Iran’s oil customers to stop purchases completely in the long run.  Iran is OPEC’s third-largest producer, with output at around 4 million barrels per day (bpd) or 4 percent of global supply. “As oil sanctions against Iran take effect, perhaps in combination with production problems elsewhere, maintaining global supply might be very challenging and would come at the expense of maintaining an adequate spare capacity cushion,” the IEA said. Saudi Arabia, Iran’s arch-foe and a close ally of Washington, has pledged intervention to prevent any supply shortage. Saudi Arabia is producing around 10.4 million bpd and could in theory raise output to above 12 million bpd.  But such a move would leave the world with virtually no spare capacity to cushion against possible supply disruptions in producer countries like Libya, Venezuela or Nigeria. “Thus, the market outlook could be far less calm at that point than it is today,” the Paris-based IEA said. Besides supply fears, oil prices are being supported by healthy demand growth that has repeatedly surprised on the upside in recent years despite a recovery in prices. The IEA kept its 2018 oil demand growth forecast unchanged at 1.4 million bpd but raised its 2019 forecast by around 110,000 bpd to 1.49 million bpd. “Another factor to consider is that trade tensions might escalate and lead to slower economic growth, and in turn lower oil demand,” the IEA said, referring to a trade dispute between the United States and China.

2018-08-10,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will work to improve the monitoring of emissions from heavy industries like steel, coal-fired power generation, coke and chemicals in key regions over the coming three years, stepping up an already-intensive campaign to tackle smog. “There remain some outstanding problems in environmental monitoring, such as repeated data forgery and illicit administrative intervention,” the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) said in a statement on Friday. China has been trying to crack down on fraudulent data reporting and the misuse and manipulation of monitoring equipment. Since issuing new rules last year, it has exposed dozens of cases and punished hundreds of officials.  However, a report to China’s parliament in July warned that there were still enforcement “gaps” and a shortage of monitoring points in some regions.  This week the MEE castigated officials in the city of Linfen in the major coal-producing province of Shanxi province for deliberately interfering with air pollution monitoring stations on nearly 100 occasions in the past year. According to the Friday statement, China aims to ensure that environmental monitoring data is “accurate, genuine, objective and comprehensive” and wants monitoring institutes and staff to be completely independent of local governments by 2020. China already has set up a total of 1,436 state-controlled monitoring stations in 338 cities since 2012, and plans to install even more equipment to provide a more detailed picture of pollution across the country. It also aims to plug all major polluters into a real-time, online monitoring system by the end of the year. Eventually it aims to extend the system to all industrial enterprises, allowing authorities to detect and treat excess emissions almost immediately.  Steel mills, paper makers, coal-fired heat and power generators, chemical producers and urban sewage disposal plants in the smog-prone Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River delta and Fenwei plain regions will be the main target of the latest campaign. The MEE also plans to randomly select around 200 environmental monitoring institutes across the country every year to check their qualifications and operations. Inspections will focus on air pollution monitoring this year, water pollution in 2019 and remaining issues in 2020. The ministry said it will also urge local authorities to draw up their own regional plans to coordinate with Beijing’s efforts.

2018-08-10,"SHANGHAI, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Worries over the plunging Turkish lira and Russian rouble pulled the euro lower on Friday and rippled through riskier assets worldwide, sending stock markets lower and buoying safe haven assets such as U.S. Treasuries. The euro fell to its lowest level since July 2017 and the dollar rallied as Washington piled pressure on Ankara and Moscow. The lira went into free-fall, sinking more than 10 percent to all-time lows. European stocks looked set to start well in the red, following losses in Asia and U.S. futures. Spreadbetters indicated London’s FTSE was set to open 4 points lower at 7,738, Frankfurt’s DAX 17 points lower at 12,660 and Paris’ CAC 11 points down at 5,491. U.S. S&P mini-futures were down 0.4 percent, after modest losses on Wall Street overnight. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 1.1 percent, trimming its gains for the week to 0.6 percent. The Nikkei stock index fell 1.3 percent as the yen firmed and investors fretted over trade pressure from Washington, overshadowing data which showed Japan’s economy expanded faster-than-expected in the second quarter. Worries over the escalating Sino-U.S. trade conflict continued to drag on shares in China, with the Shanghai Composite index down 0.4 percent. The tech-heavy ChiNext Composite index trimmed its early gains, but was still 0.2 percent higher in afternoon trade, extending Thursday’s strong gains. Josh Sheng, chief investment officer at Shanghai Tongshengtonghui Asset Management, said that a late rally in tech shares this week reflected moves by Beijing to boost local firms, such as revamping a government leadership group to focus on supporting homegrown technology. “The market in China is ‘risk on’ thanks to government support policies and rising infrastructure investment. I am optimistic about the A-share market for the rest of 2018,” he said. The Shanghai composite has gained 1.5 percent this week, while the CSI300 is up 2.1 percent. Both indexes posted heavy losses last week. Turmoil in the lira and rouble and intensifying global trade tensions pushed the dollar to 13-month highs. The dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a group of six major currencies, breached the 96 level, taking it to its highest level since July 14, 2017. The euro dropped 0.6 percent to $1.1456 after earlier falling as low as $1.1436, a 13-month low. The dollar was 0.1 percent lower at 110.97 yen. Turkey’s lira plumbed new depths against the dollar, with a meeting between a Turkish delegation and U.S. officials in Washington yielding no apparent solution to a diplomatic rift over the detention in Turkey of a U.S. pastor. Deepening investor concerns about Turkey’s authoritarian trajectory under President Tayyip Erdogan and the economic fallout have also weighed on the currency. By 0617 GMT, the lira was at 6.4, having fallen as low as 6.4915 earlier. The currency has lost more than one third of its value this year.

2018-08-10,"* China threatens to slap import tariff on U.S. LNG supplies * Northern hemisphere heatwave triggers strong cooling demand * APLNG in partial September maintenance outage * Overall supplies from Australia, US, Russia rising By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Asian spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices held largely steady this week as healthy demand and relatively tight supplies supported the market. LNG cargo prices for delivery in September LNG-AS were around $10 per million British thermal units (Btu), unchanged from last week, while cargoes for delivery in October were priced around $1 per mmBtu higher, traders said. Consumption of power fuels like LNG and thermal coal has been unseasonably strong as severe heatwaves, especially in Asia and Europe, have pushed up demand for residential and industrial cooling. Meanwhile, maintenance work at the Australia Pacific liquefied natural gas (APLNG) plant in September will take some supply from the market, while Malaysian LNG exports hit a four-year low due to ongoing pipeline trouble. Analysts said a threat late last week by China’s government to slap import tariff on U.S. LNG imports could further push up prices. “If China implements tariffs on U.S. LNG imports, we would expect to see spot LNG prices move higher in the short-term,” ANZ bank said on Friday. Shipping data shows that U.S. LNG sales to China have already slumped to 130,000 tonnes in July from almost 400,000 tonnes in May, while supplies from the Asia/Pacific region have increased. U.S. LNG exports only started in 2015, and sales to China were a booming business opportunity for the American natural gas industry, while China needs LNG to meet its soaring demand amid its programme of moving millions of households and factories from coal to gas. “China’s ongoing campaign to switch from coal to gas heating has seen consumption demand rise 20 percent this year,” ANZ said. To meet rising demand, PetroChina is in advanced discussions with top exporter Qatar to purchase LNG under short- and long-term agreements, sources said this week. In another sign of China’s rising imports, gas distributor ENN received its maiden cargo for the country’s first major privately-owned LNG import terminal this week, Thomson Reuters Eikon shiptracking data showed. Not all factors, however, pointed to a tighter market. Overall LNG output from Australia and the United States is rising as new and expanded projects are completed. In Russia, the world’s biggest natural gas exporter but which has so far relied mostly on pipeline supplies for sales, Novatek this week launched a second LNG production train at its plant on the Yamal peninsula ahead of schedule. There were also several open tenders for available supply. ExxonMobil offered an August-September cargo from Australia’s Gorgon facility, and a September cargo from Papua New Guinea. In Africa, Angola LNG offered a cargo for loading in August. Reporting by Henning Gloystein; additional reporting by

2018-08-10,"(Adds picture available) SHANGHAI, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Asian stock markets fell on Friday amid heightened global trade tensions, while currency markets were whipsawed by a searing  selloff in Russia’s rouble after the United States slapped new sanctions, and as economic worries sent the Turkish lira tumbling. Washington said it would impose fresh sanctions because it had determined that Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian agent and his daughter in Britain, which the Kremlin denies. The rouble slid to its lowest level since late 2016 on Thursday, hitting 66.7099 roubles to the dollar. At 0021 GMT Thursday, it was changing hands at 66.5245 to the dollar. Turkey’s lira fell to record lows against the dollar on Thursday, with a meeting between a Turkish delegation and U.S. officials in Washington yielding no apparent solution to a diplomatic rift over the detention in Turkey of a U.S. pastor. Deepening investor concerns about Turkey’s authoritarian trajectory under President Tayyip Erdogan and the economic fallout have also weighed on the currency. The lira stood at 5.5700 against the dollar at 0021 GMT, after touching an all-time low. Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak is set to unveil the latest plan for Turkey’s economy on Friday. The turmoil in emerging currencies and ongoing global trade tensions helped to support the dollar Thursday, but it was little changed in early Asian trading. The dollar was flat against the yen and euro, while the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals was 0.1 percent higher at 95.613. U.S. Treasury yields also fell on the risk-off mood. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 2.9276 percent compared with its U.S. close of 2.935 percent on Thursday. In equity markets, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.3 percent.

2018-08-10,"SHANGHAI, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Asian stock markets fell on Friday amid heightened global trade tensions, while currency markets were whipsawed by a searing  selloff in Russia’s rouble after the United States slapped on new sanctions, and as economic worries sent the Turkish lira tumbling. Washington said it would impose fresh sanctions because it had determined that Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian agent and his daughter in Britain, which the Kremlin denies. The rouble slid to its lowest level since late 2016 on Thursday, hitting 66.7099 roubles to the dollar. At 0021 GMT Thursday, it was changing hands at 66.5245 to the dollar. Turkey’s lira fell to record lows against the dollar on Thursday, with a meeting between a Turkish delegation and U.S. officials in Washington yielding no apparent solution to a diplomatic rift over the detention in Turkey of a U.S. pastor. Deepening investor concerns about Turkey’s authoritarian trajectory under President Tayyip Erdogan and the economic fallout have also weighed on the currency. The lira stood at 5.5700 against the dollar at 0021 GMT, after touching an all-time low. Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak is set to unveil the latest plan for Turkey’s economy on Friday. The turmoil in emerging currencies and ongoing global trade tensions helped to support the dollar Thursday, but it was little changed in early Asian trading. The dollar was flat against the yen and euro, while the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals was 0.1 percent higher at 95.613. U.S. Treasury yields also fell on the risk-off mood. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 2.9276 percent compared with its U.S. close of 2.935 percent on Thursday. In equity markets, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.3 percent.

2018-08-10,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil cut its greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation in 2017 to levels below its internationally agreed 2020 climate change targets, the country’s Environment Ministry said on Thursday.  Brazil reduced its emission from deforestation in the Amazon rainforest by 610 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2), compared to its 2020 target of 564 million tonnes. In the Cerrado savanna, emissions were reduced 170 million tonnes of carbon dioxide versus a target of 104 million tonnes. The Amazon, the world’s largest tropical rainforest, and the Cerrado, South America’s biggest savanna, soak up vast amounts of carbon dioxide and their preservation is seen as vital to the fight against climate change. But destruction of the forest releases large quantities of CO2, one of the main greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming. Large-scale Amazon deforestation has made Brazil one of the world’s top greenhouse gas emitters, due to fires and the spread of agriculture and cattle ranching. The 2020 emission goals were set out in the 2009 Copenhagen Accord to combat climate change. Under the more ambitious Paris Agreement in 2015 on climate change, Brazil has set goals for further steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for 2025 and 2030. “The policy message is that we can and should remain in the Paris Agreement (because) it is possible to effectively implement the commitments that have been made,” said Thiago Mendes, secretary of climate change in the Environment Ministry.

2018-08-10,"TURKANA, Kenya, Aug 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Kenyan villager Ekeno Pedo never considered that golden fields of sorghum - or indeed any crop - might one day flourish on the outskirts of his village in drought-stricken Turkana county. “From the time I was a small herdsboy in this community I never imagined the possibility of farming in this area given the tough climate and our nomadic lifestyle,” said 65-year-old Pedo. The fields that have sprung up in this vast and arid scrubland in Kenya’s northwest are in part due to the hard work of refugees, who have come here from neighbouring South Sudan, Ethiopia and Uganda in recent decades. Turkana is Kenya’s second-largest county and its poorest, yet in 2015 it donated 1,500 hectares (3,707 acres) of land for the refugee settlement of about 60,000 people near Pedo’s village of Kalobeyei. The idea was to develop an agricultural project that would help bring together the new arrivals and locals. Residents and refugees alike say it has worked well. “Apart from seeing our people marry some of the refugees, they also guide us a lot when it comes to farming, because some of them came from communities that depended on agriculture,” said 50-year-old nomadic pastoralist, Jeremiah Kazimoto. Namuzungu Berta, a refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo, said it was liberating for refugees to grow their own food and earn an income, instead of relying on aid. “With this arrangement, we now have the freedom to choose what to eat, because we can either grow it or buy from the community,” said Berta. The project began as kitchen gardens in 2016, but today it includes 100 hectares of sorghum, a cereal, with large fields subdivided between refugees and the local community, which both harvest and earn money from the crop. When the sorghum ripens, the farmers sell it to aid agencies, which grind it and use it to feed the refugees. “I harvested seven bags of sorghum from my quarter-hectare piece of land, and I sold four of them to the Red Cross at a premium price of 3,000 Kenyan shillings ($30) for a 50-kilogramme bag,” said Jackson Akure Sokona, a resident from nearby Kolioro village. The kitchen gardens and the more recent sorghum crop were part of a 15 million euro ($17.4 million) development project for the area funded by the European Union Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, and implemented by the local authorities and the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The 14-year project, which ends in 2030, aims to provide refugees with sustainable livelihoods through agriculture, while helping them integrate with their host community. It is the first of its kind in Kenya, U.N. officials said. “Due to prolonged political instability in some neighbouring countries, refugees are almost permanent here. So it makes sense to allow them to generate an income alongside the host community,” said Gabriel Rugalema from the FAO in Kenya. “When you allow them to mingle and work together, they get used to each other,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Kenya continues to experience an influx of refugees, the FAO said, which reinforces the need to help them become economically self-sufficient and less dependent on aid. Local authorities say they also hope to avoid complications encountered in 2015 at Kakuma camp, some 40 kilometres away, where the host community felt they did not benefit from the refugees’ presence. The goal at Kalobeyei is for the local community of about 20,000 people to take over the refugees’ small-scale farms if and when they go home, allowing the area to remain productive. “Food security is one of our priorities, and if the refugees can work alongside our communities to produce food locally, then we must support such an initiative,” Turkana deputy governor Peter Emuria Lotethiro told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Turkana’s low rainfall makes farming here challenging. The area is sorely in need of rainwater harvesting techniques such as sand dams and underground water tanks. In addition, its soils and water are saline and struggle to support agriculture, which is why most local people keep livestock - mainly sheep and goats. But technologies like sunken-bed farming and irrigation have enabled them to use stored rainwater to cultivate crops. “We are using proven rainwater harvesting techniques to capitalise on perennial floods in this area whenever it rains,” said Zippy Mbati, a programme officer at the World Food Programme. Community members who take part in the farming project are trained to plant sorghum using a method in which a sand barrier is built in front of the growing area, capturing rainwater and releasing it slowly, the FAO said. Work is underway to expand the area under cultivation: the Turkana government and the FAO are due to set up an irrigation system on a 400-hectare piece of land set aside for farming in Kalobeyei, said FAO field officer Michael Ngututo. This will give 3,500 people enough land to produce about 100 metric tonnes of food worth 100 million Kenyan shillings ($996,000), Ngututo said. Meantime, refugees who have made this arid part of Kenya home said they were glad of the difference the project has made to their lives. “As a refugee, it is very exciting that I am able to grow and feed my children on fresh vegetables,” said Hellen Chebachoge, who was relocated here from Dadaab refugee camp in northeast Kenya earlier this year. “I came from a farming community in Uganda, and so having a kitchen garden makes me feel at home.” Reporting by Isaiah Esipisu.
