2018-10-20,"ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - The ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) came first in a parliamentary election in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq, winning 45 seats, the election commission said on Sunday, positioning it to lead the next regional government. A year after a failed bid for independence, Iraq’s Kurds voted last month in a parliamentary election that could disrupt the delicate balance of power in the region. Announcement of the results was delayed for three weeks after the Independent High Elections and Referendum Commission said it received and was investigating 1,045 complaints of electoral violations. The KDP’s historic rival and junior coalition partner in government, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), was in second place with 21 seats, the commission said in a news conference. With opposition parties weak, the KDP and PUK are likely to extend their almost three decades of sharing power, but the results suggest that Masoud Barzani’s KDP will take a dominant position in Kurdish politics. On Sept. 30, election day, the PUK said it might not recognise the results of the election due to what it described as electoral violations but then appeared to backtrack, injecting uncertainty into the process. Election observers also said there were irregularities. The two parties, who fought a civil war in the 1990s but more recently have taken to sharing power, have recently come out of a gruelling political battle in Baghdad, where they competed for the presidency of federal Iraq. The PUK came out on top with the election of Barham Salih. The largest Kurdish opposition party, Gorran, or Movement for Change, was a distant third with 12 seats.  There are 111 seats in the Iraqi Kurdistan Parliament with 11 reserved for minority groups.

2018-10-20,"(Recasts with oil minister interview, adds figures) By Ahmed Rasheed and Ahmed Aboulenein SULAIMANIYA/ERBIL, Iraq, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi has reversed his decision to transfer the ownership of nine state-owned oil companies from the ministry to the newly formed National Oil Company, the ministry said on Saturday. He later told state television in an interview that Iraq hopes to produce 7 million barrels of oil a day (bpd) through the National Oil Company and to export 4 million bpd in 2019. The reversal of the transfer decision would enable the incoming government of Prime Minister-designate Adel Abdul Mahdi to make its own decisions in  the oil sector, the ministry said in a statement. Luaibi is the oil minister in an outgoing government led by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. A senior Iraqi oil official told Reuters that Abdul Mahdi had been annoyed by the original transfer decision which had been “made in a rush and without his approval.” Luaibi had issued a decree on Thursday transferring ownership of the nine state-owned oil companies, including state oil marketer SOMO, to the National Oil Company. On the same day, Abdul Mahdi, who has the task of forming a new government after months of political deadlock following a May election, called on officials in the outgoing government to refrain from signing urgent contracts, making non-essential hires, or other key decisions. The Iraqi government last week named Luaibi as head of the new company, which is to serve as an umbrella organisation for state oil firms. Luaibi currently holds both the position of minister and that of company chief. Parliament voted in March to set up the company, which is meant to manage Iraq’s upstream operations and free up the ministry to be able to set plans and strategies for developing the sector. In an interview with state television on Saturday night, Luaibi said Iraq hoped to export 1 million bpd through Jordan’s Akaba port, without specifying a timeline. The burning of gas produced as a byproduct of oil extraction would stop by 2021, he said. The northern refinery of Baiji was brought back online and is producing 70,000 bpd, Luaibi added.

2018-10-20,"DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzanian police have arrested 104 suspected militants planning to establish bases in neighbouring Mozambique, where scores of people have been killed in Islamist attacks over the last year, a senior official said. Forty attacks have been carried out since October 2017 in Mozambique’s Cabo Delgado province, an area near the Tanzanian border close to where companies are developing one of the biggest natural gas finds in a decade. More than 100 people have been killed, often by decapitation. In a press conference on Friday, Inspector General of Police Simon Sirro said security forces had launched operations over the last few months against “criminals” in eastern and southern areas, but that some of them had managed to flee. “During that operation, some criminals were arrested and some ... died, and a few escaped. Those who escaped are the ones trying to cross the border to Mozambique to establish a base,” he told a news conference. “After questioning them, they said they were going there to join radical camps,” Sirro added. Earlier this month, Mozambique put 189 people, including foreigners, on trial on accusations of involvement in Islamist attacks in Cabo Delgado. [L8N1WJ557] The province is near one of the world’s biggest untapped offshore natural gas fields, and Anadarko Petroleum is seeking to raise $14 billion-$15 billion for a liquefied natural gas project in the region. In June, President Filipe Nyusi vowed to be relentless and firm in detaining those responsible for the attacks. Mozambique has no history of Islamist militancy and authorities have been reluctant to ascribe the attacks to Islamists. About 30 percent of Mozambique’s 30 million people are Roman Catholics, while 18 percent are Muslim.

2018-10-20,"TUZI, Montenegro (Reuters) - Dozens of environmental activists cycled from Montenegro’s capital to the Albanian border on Saturday to protest over the neighboring nation’s construction of a dam on the Cijevna river that flows through both countries. As governments hurry to meet renewable energy goals set by the Paris climate change agreement, plans to build almost 3,000 small hydro-power plants have sparked protests across the Balkans this year.  At Saturday’s demonstration, some of the protesters carried placards reading “The Cijevna is our Fortune”. “Don’t (put) the Cijevna in pipes,” red a banner spread along a bridge over a dry river bed, where protesters gathered. Critics say the dams are endangering Europe’s last free-flowing rivers, including the Cijevna, or Cem as it is called in Albanian. “When you clog veins in a human body, a human dies; so do rivers,” said Adem Kajosaj, 60, a pensioner and fisherman from the area around the border town of Tuzi, who joined the protest. A dam on the 60 kilometer-long (40-mile) river is already being built, and protesters say Albania did not request consent from authorities in Montenegro or notify them about the project. They have also criticized Montenegrin authorities for failing to lodge a protest with Albania. The two countries signed a deal on joint water management earlier this year. Authorities and investors say boosting hydro power will reduce regional dependency on coal and comply with European Union energy policies. All the countries of the Western Balkans — Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia and Albania — want to join the bloc.  Most of the small hydro plants in the region produce no more than 1 megawatt (MW) each — roughly enough to power 750 homes, but environmentalists say they disrupt fish migration routes and pose a threat to dozens of species, including the Danube Salmon and Balkan Lynx. In southern Bosnia on Saturday, villagers protested over the construction of two dams on the river Doljanka by a company owned by NBA former player Mirza Teletovic. “Ninety-five percent of villagers in the area where Doljanka flows have signed a petition against the mini hydro plants, which would destroy local community’s plans to develop fly-fishing and sport fishing,” the Coalition for the protection of rivers in Bosnia, the NGO, said in a statement.

2018-10-20,"(In paragraph 9, removes incorrect description of Dunleavy as “retired Air Force lieutenant colonel”, clarifies he was a former teacher) By Yereth Rosen ANCHORAGE, Alaska, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Alaska Governor Bill Walker, a political independent, halted his re-election campaign on Friday and endorsed his Democratic challenger, ending a three-way contest in which neither had appeared capable of defeating the Republican front-runner. With just 18 days left before the Nov. 6 election, Walker said he concluded that he could not win a second term in a race against both former U.S. Senator Mark Begich, a Democrat, and former state Senator Mike Dunleavy, a Republican. Walker, 67, said his decision to bow out was based entirely on what he felt was “best for Alaska” and involved no deal with the Democrat or any promise of a role in a Begich administration should he win. Walker’s withdrawal came three days after his former running mate, Byron Mallott, a Democrat and the first Alaska Native elected to statewide office, abruptly resigned as lieutenant governor over admitted but unspecified “inappropriate comments” in a scandal that threw the governor’s campaign into disarray. But public opinion surveys were already showing Dunleavy, 57, running well ahead of the two other men and indicated Begich, 56, had greater support than the incumbent governor. After consulting for days on whether Walker or Begich had a better shot at running a competitive race against Dunleavy, the determination was made that “Begich has the better odds,” the governor said in a statement posted on his campaign’s website. Walker also said Begich’s positions on various key issues “more closely align with my priorities for Alaska,” including their support for Medicaid expansion in Alaska and state action on climate change. Dunleavy opposes both. “Today’s developments leave Alaska voters with a clear choice,” Dunleavy’s campaign said after learning Walker halted his re-election campaign. A former teacher and outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump, Dunleavy had focused his campaign on criticizing Walker for reducing the annual oil-fund dividends all Alaska residents receive. Walker has said limiting the payout was necessary to address big budget deficits. Dunleavy has advocated deeper spending cuts and more oil and mining development. The latest announcement came at the annual convention of the Alaska Federation of Natives, a powerful constituency in the state, just before Walker, Begich and Dunleavy were all scheduled to participate in a gubernatorial debate. Begich and Walker, whose name will remain on the ballot despite his withdrawal, were widely seen as likely to take votes away from each other in a three-way race. Begich, a one-time Anchorage mayor who served six years as a U.S. senator from Alaska ending in 2015, called Walker’s move “unbelievably gracious.” Walker changed his party affiliation from Republican to independent before launching his successful 2014 campaign for governor on a “unity” ticket with Mallot as his running mate. In that election, Walker unseated the Republican incumbent, Sean Parnell, who had been lieutenant governor under Sarah Palin, the one-time Republican U.S. vice presidential nominee, and he became governor in 2009 when she quit. Walker’s campaign spokesman previously acknowledged that the governor and Begich had been in talks for days to discuss a “path forward that’s best for Alaska.” Begich told reporters Friday night he did not know of Walker’s decision until just before it was announced.

2018-10-20,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration wants pollution limits on ship fuels that a United Nations maritime agency will implement in 2020 to be phased in to protect consumers from any price spikes in heating and trucking fuels, a White House spokesman said on Friday. Under the International Maritime Organization rule, ships cannot use fuels with more than 0.5 percent of sulfur, compared with 3.5 percent now, unless equipped with so-called scrubbers limiting the emissions. The rule will be enforced through fines levied by IMO member states. The IMO said last month it would not delay implementation after some shipping groups as well as the Bahamas, Panama, Liberia and the Marshall Islands supported a phased-in implementation of the rules. If refiners are unprepared for the changes, some analysts have said, prices for related fuels, such as diesel and heating oil, could rise. A spike in fuel prices ahead of the 2020 elections would be a political risk for Trump.  “The United States supports an experience building phase, which has been proposed by several other countries, in IMO 2020 in order to mitigate the impact of precipitous fuel cost increases on consumers,” the White House spokesman said. The administration was not seeking a delay of the rules, the spokesman said. A phase-in would mean that the rule would not have to be fully complied with until a later unspecified date. Jason Bordoff, founding director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy policy, and a former White House adviser on energy to former U.S. President Barack Obama, indicated that a phase-in would be unnecessary. Reducing emissions from ships brings “HUGE” health benefits and the industry has known about the upcoming rules for “YEARS,” Bordoff tweeted. Many U.S. refineries and shippers have already spent billions of dollars on preparing for cleaner fuel, and the rules already have opportunities for waivers, he added. “The administration wants to ensure that IMO 2020 occurs in a manner that is not harmful to consumers and the global economy,” the White House spokesman said. His comments were first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Analysts at Energy Aspects were skeptical the Trump administration could change the process. “Given that the IMO rulemaking process takes nearly two years to run its course, it is unclear how any proposed phased implementation could be accomplished at an international level,” analyst Robert Campbell wrote.
