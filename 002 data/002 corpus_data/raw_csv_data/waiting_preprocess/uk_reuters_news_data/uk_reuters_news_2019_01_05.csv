2019-01-05,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The German Federal State of Baden-Wuerttemberg is seeking damages from Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) after local authorities purchased VW diesel vehicles which now face bans in cities like Stuttgart, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said on Saturday. The value of diesel cars plummeted after German environmental groups scored a court victory last year that forced cities to consider bans of older diesel vehicles to bring emissions into line with European Union clean air rules. The FAZ daily said state authorities filed a lawsuit with a court in Stuttgart at the end of last year, seeking damages totalling “low double digit millions”.  Volkswagen could not confirm this, and told Reuters the company had not seen the particular lawsuit.  But it added that previous court decisions had backed its stance that legal actions to seek damages are without merit given that VW cars had valid road certification at the time of sale. Officials at Baden-Wuerttemberg state could not be immediately reached for comment. The paper said taxpayer money had been spent on buying and leasing diesel vehicles for the police service. It did not specify how Baden-Wuerttemberg had lost money.  U.S. regulators in 2015 blew the whistle on Volkswagen’s systematic emissions test cheating which revealed that the carmaker’s vehicles emitted far higher levels of nitrogen oxide pollution than permitted by the law.  A global clampdown on pollution ensued, prompting regulators and environmental groups in Germany to scrutinise emissions. Unlike in the United States, older VW cars have not been found to be illegal in Germany after the carmaker agreed recall its vehicles to modify emissions filtering systems.

2019-01-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - All countries that were granted waivers from the United States to continue buying a certain amount of Iranian oil imports are complying with U.S. sanctions, a senior Iranian energy official said, noting that Tehran was hopeful to find new buyers.  The United States withdrew from a nuclear deal with Iran last year and snapped sanctions in place to choke Iran’s oil and banking industries, while temporarily allowing eight customers to keep buying crude from the Islamic Republic.  “China, India, Japan, South Korea and other countries that were granted waivers from America to import Iranian oil are not willing to buy even one barrel more from Iran,” Amir Hossein Zamaninia, Iran’s deputy oil minister for trade and international affairs, was quoted as saying by the Oil Ministry’s news agency SHANA. However, without giving details, Zamaninia said: “Despite U.S. pressures on Iranian oil market, the number of potential buyers of Iranian oil has significantly increased due to a competitive market, greed and pursuit of more profit.”  The 180-day exemptions were also granted to Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey. Washington seeks to bring Iranian oil exports to zero in order to curb Tehran’s missile and nuclear programs and counter its growing military and political influence in the Middle East. Iran has urged European countries, which are still committed to the nuclear deal, to oppose the sanctions by creating a financial mechanism that facilitates payments of Iranian oil sales. Zamaninia said the mechanism, known as SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle for trade), would be “helpful but could not resolve the problems since U.S. influence will affect any European action”.

2019-01-05,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will take action against highly-polluting diesel trucks by imposing tougher fuel and engine standards, raising rail freight volumes and strengthening its monitoring capabilities, new guidelines published by the environment ministry said. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment said in a policy document on Friday it would aim to “significantly increase” the number of diesel trucks capable of meeting emission standards by 2020, targeting a compliance rate of at least 90 percent by next year.  It also promised to improve the quality of diesel, crack down on low-grade fuel and reduce overall nitrogen oxide and particulate matter emissions from fuel combustion. New trucks that fail to comply with state requirements will not be allowed to enter the market, and key regions will also be ordered to implement advanced “China VI” fuel standards starting in July this year, the document said. China is in the fifth year of a “war on pollution” but average emission levels in many smog-prone northern cities remain significantly higher than the levels recommended by the government. The northern regions near the capital Beijing will eliminate more than 1 million outdated diesel-fueled trucks by the end of 2020. Tougher controls on diesel freight will also be imposed during smog build-ups, it said.        National rail freight rates would be increased by 30 percent compared with 2017, and China will work to ensure that long-distance bulk commodity deliveries are done via rail or ships, it said.  Tackling truck emissions has become a major part of China’s efforts to curb pollution. Though trucks produce 13 times more pollution per unit of cargo than trains, the share of rail in total freight amounted to just 7.7 percent in 2017. The environment ministry said last year that while diesel trucks accounted for just 7.8 percent of China’s total vehicles, they contributed as much as 57.3 percent of total nitrogen dioxide emissions and more than three quarters of airborne particulate matter.    The ministry plans to charge higher fees and introduce more stringent monitoring procedures to try to persuade firms to make better use of the rail network to deliver goods.
