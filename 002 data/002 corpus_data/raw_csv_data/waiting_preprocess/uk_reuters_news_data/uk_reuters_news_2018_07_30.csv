2018-07-30,"(Adds context) PARIS, July 30 (Reuters) - French utility EDF on Monday extended outages at its 1,300 megawatts (MW) St. Alban and the 900 MW Bugey 3 nuclear reactors until Aug. 1 due to a prolonged heat wave across France. Electricity generation was halted at Bugey 3, while output at St. Ablan was cut by half. EDF had warned last week that extreme weather could force it to limit production from the reactors. It halted power generation at Bugey 3 and reduced output from St. Ablan 1 on Friday. The utility, which operates France’s 58 nuclear reactors that account for more than 75 percent of France’s electricity needs, discharges water it uses as coolants for the reactors into surrounding rivers and canals. The amount of water it discharges is regulated by law to protect plant and animal life, forcing it to cut output during prolonged hot weather when river temperatures rise. Both St. Alban and Bugey nuclear power plants are situated near the Rhone River in the southern half of France where temperatures are expected to reach around 40 degrees Celsius (104°F) in some areas in the Rhone valley area, according the French weather service Meteo France. Meteo France said the heat wave was expected to continue throughout the week across France.

2018-07-30,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s King Salman arrived for a holiday in NEOM, the $500 billion (380.81 billion pounds) flagship business zone that his son and heir apparent has pledged to build from scratch in a remote corner of the kingdom, state media said on Monday. The royal family has traditionally spent much of the summer outside the country in places such as the French Riviera, Marbella in southern Spain and Tangier, Morocco. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced plans for the 26,500 square km (10,230 square mile) futuristic high-tech hub last year as part of reforms aimed at creating jobs, encouraging foreign investment and permitting new freedoms for Saudis steeped in religious puritanism and state dependency. The authorities have announced few details since then and while some companies, including Japan’s Softbank, have said they are prepared to invest in NEOM, major, concrete business ventures have not yet been announced. A statement carried by the state news agency SPA said the king would “spend some time in rest and recreation” in NEOM but gave no details.  It did not specify where the 82-year-old monarch would stay. However, in February, sources told Reuters that the government had asked local construction companies to build five palaces for the king, crown prince and other senior royals on the Red Sea coast about 150 km (95 miles) west of the city of Tabuk. These would be among the first contracts awarded for NEOM. A design document seen by Reuters shows opulent buildings with modern and traditional Moroccan-style architecture featuring Islamic designs and colourful ceramic tiles. The complex of palaces is set to include helipads, a marina and a golf course. The royal court did not immediately respond to questions about the current status of construction in NEOM, which is largely inaccessible to civilians. At least some of the palaces are believed to have been completed in a matter of months, at undisclosed cost.

2018-07-30,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Monday, with U.S. crude futures jumping more than 2 percent, as traders continued to focus on supply disruptions and a possible hit to crude output from U.S. sanctions on Iran.   October Brent crude futures LCOV8, the most actively traded contract, settled at $75.55 a barrel, up 79 cents. The September Brent contract, which expires on Tuesday, settled at $74.97, up 68 cents, or 0.9 percent. Volumes in an expiring contract tend to dwindle in the last few days before it goes off the board.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (WTI) CLc1 rose $1.44, or 2.1 percent, to settle at $70.13 a barrel. WTI rose on expectations that U.S. inventories fell last week and worries that an outage at a Syncrude facility in Canada will not be solved as soon as expected, traders said. “We’re just getting tighter and tighter here in the U.S. in terms of supply, particularly in Cushing,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital Management in New York. “That’s why you’re seeing WTI rise.” Crude inventories at the Oklahoma, delivery point for WTI have been dwindling, in part due to the situation at the Syncrude facility that has reduced the flow of oil into the hub.  Stocks at the Cushing dropped to 23.7 million barrels, the lowest since November 2014 in the week to July 20. [EIA/S] Energy information company Genscape, however, said that inventories at the Cushing rose almost 200,000 barrels, or nearly 1 percent, from Tuesday to Friday last week, according to traders. Oil prices have rebounded from recent lows over the last two weeks, as looming sanctions on Iran have already started to curtail exports from that country. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he would meet with Iran’s President, Hassan Rouhani. “The best-case scenario is that the U.S. provides meaningful sanction waivers in the run-up to the mid-term elections and Iran can get away with a loss of around 500-700,000 barrels per day of exports,” PVM Oil Associates Tamas Varga said in a note. The market held gains even after a Reuters survey showed the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries increased production in July. OPEC hiked production 70,000 barrels per day to 32.64 million bpd, a 2018 high. Further supply increases could offset production outages and pressure prices.  Prices remain buoyed by a tight supply outlook, with global inventories down from record highs in 2017 and U.S. inventories at three-year lows, said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.  “If you take a step back and look at where global inventories and U.S. inventories are, you’re seeing a tighter picture than where we were a year ago,” McGillian said. “Overall, I think the market is in the process of stabilizing.” Saudi Arabia last week said it was suspending oil shipments through the Red Sea’s Bab al-Mandeb strait, one of the world’s most important tanker routes, after Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthis attacked two ships in the waterway.  “The ongoing concerns about the lack of supply coming out of the Bab al-Mandeb strait on top of continued disruption in Venezuela seems to be giving the market momentum, not to mention the potential loss of Iranian supply,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.

2018-07-30,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of global equity markets fell on Monday, pulled down by a sell-off in U.S. technology heavyweights, while the dollar slipped against the euro ahead of several central bank monetary policy meetings later this week. Most major currencies stuck to narrow trading ranges ahead of central bank decisions. The Bank of Japan ends a two-day meeting on Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve concludes its policy meeting on Wednesday, and the Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates on Thursday. Shares in Europe fell, led by a 2.9 percent decline in software maker SAP SE (SAPG.DE) and a 2.5 percent drop in French industrial gases company Air Liquide (AIRP.PA). The FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 of leading European shares closed down 0.3 percent.  MSCI’s all-country world stock index .MIWD00000PUS fell 0.37 percent on weakness in the so-called U.S. FAANG group: Facebook (FB.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Netflix (NFLX.O) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O).  Wall Street stocks also closed down on the tech sell-off, which included Microsoft (MSFT.O) as another big decliner. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 144.23 points, or 0.57 percent, to 25,306.83. The S&P 500 .SPX lost 16.22 points, or 0.58 percent, to 2,802.6 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 107.42 points, or 1.39 percent, to 7,630.00. The technology index .SPLRCT tumbled 1.78 percent as disappointing results spurred concerns about future growth for a sector that has led U.S. equities to record highs. (Graphic: FAANG market cap - reut.rs/2mRA3oi)    “There’s a lot of money and speculation piled into the FAANG stocks, and now that money is coming out,” said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services in New York. “It’s money coming out of a crowded trade,” he said.   Industrials, energy and materials led gainers on Wall Street, with Caterpillar (CAT.N) raising its full-year outlook after second-quarter earnings nearly doubled and beat expectations, helped by robust global demand for its equipment. A revival in global growth may lift stocks even as tech shares stop leading the market higher, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. “You’re seeing a change in leadership in the market, and that’s the underlying story here. Energy, financials, materials and industrials are the early leaders,” Arone said. The S&P telecommunications services index .SPLRCL rose 1.95 percent and the S&P energy sector .SPNY jumped 0.84 percent as oil prices gained. Investors remained cautious over the supply outlook and a potential hit to global output due to U.S. sanctions on Iran.     U.S. crude CLc1 rose $1.44 to settle at $70.13 a barrel while Brent LCOc1 settled up 68 cents at $74.97. The dollar slipped the most against the euro, with the common currency 0.41 percent higher as it recovered from its weakest weekly performance against the greenback in six weeks. The euro tumbled last week after the European Central Bank reaffirmed that rates would stay low through next year’s summer. Analysts said the euro rebounded largely because traders felt it had been oversold last week.  The dollar index .DXY fell 0.33 percent, while the Japanese yen JPY= retreated slightly, slipping 0.04 percent versus the greenback to 111.07 per dollar. The euro EUR= rose to $1.1703. Euro zone government bond yields rose after a strong Italian auction boosted demand for Italian debt at the expense of higher-rated markets in the bloc. Expectations for the upcoming Bank of Japan meeting also pressured yields, analysts said, along with German and Spanish inflation data that remained slightly above the ECB’s price stability target in July. Germany’s 10-year government bond yield DE10YT=RR, the benchmark for the euro zone, rose more than 4 basis points to a six-week high of 0.46 percent. Yields on U.S. Treasury bonds rose, with the benchmark 10-year at a six-week high, as investors sold U.S. government bonds on growing speculation that the BOJ may adjust its ultra-loose monetary policy at its meeting.  U.S. benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR were down 3/32 in price to yield 2.9747 percent. Gold steadied ahead of this week’s Fed meeting, which could give clues about the outlook for U.S. interest rates and the dollar, key factors for precious metals prices. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 for August delivery settled down $1.70 at $1,221.30 per ounce.

2018-07-30,"(Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) has hired an investment bank to organize an auction for its digital assets, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday citing people familiar with the matter. GE’s multibillion-dollar digital business, which includes its Predix software system and applications, has been struggling with technical issues and weakening sales.   GE has been seeking partners to invest in GE Digital as it narrowed the target markets for the division and abandoned plans to build a cloud platform, instead partnering with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) clouds.  Faced with cash constraints and falling profits at its large power business, GE chose to reduce investment in the digital unit and focus on partnerships.  The Wall Street Journal report did not reveal the exact assets for sale or the potential deal value.GE declined to comment. Former GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt invested more than $4 billion in GE Digital and placed it at the strategic center of what he called GE’s new role as a “digital industrial company.”  But technical issues and competition from less costly systems slowed the unit’s growth, forcing GE to shift strategy.  The unit, which became a standalone business in 2015, has not reported profit and loss as other GE units do. It posted revenue of $4 billion last year, a 12 percent increase from 2016, GE said.  But growth has slowed. Revenue growth was flat in the latest quarter, compared with a year ago, and new orders fell 23 percent, GE said earlier this month.  GE also has been laying off programmers at the GE Digital’s San Ramon, California, headquarters.      The potential sale of digital assets comes amid a broader GE restructuring. The Boston-based conglomerate said in June that it plans to spin off its healthcare business and divest its stake in oil-services firm Baker Hughes (BHGE.N), effectively breaking up the 126-year-old company.  The slimmed-down company under Chief Executive John Flannery will focus on jet engines, power plants and renewable energy, which GE hopes will reward battered shareholders who have seen the stock lose more than half its value over the past 20 years. GE shares were up 0.7 percent at $13.14 in afternoon trading on Monday.

Italy has told its allies it wants to hold an international conference on Libya this autumn and Conte was eager to get Trump’s blessing for the gathering at their meeting on Monday. Italy is competing with neighbouring France over how best to deal with Libya, which has been wracked by violence for years. Conte believes a conference in Rome, backed by the United States, will help Rome establish itself as the major interlocutor for Libya’s warring factions. After their meeting, Conte said Trump had agreed Italy would become “a reference point in Europe and the main interlocutor for the main issues that need to be faced ... with particular reference to Libya.” “We are going to discuss economic aspects, but also social aspects: the need for protection of civil rights; the problem of constitutional process - of issuing and passing laws so as to enable Libya, in particular, to get to democratic elections in a condition of the utmost stability,” Conte said.

2018-07-30,"* Africa’s largest power firm emerging from financial crisis * Workers bring utility to its knees for 2nd month in row * Eskom warns high risk of outages this week (Recasts after Eskom statement) JOHANNESBURG, July 30 (Reuters) - South Africa’s struggling state power firm Eskom warned on Monday that there was a high risk of electricity cuts this week, as wage protests disrupted its operations for the second month in a row. Eskom, which supplies more than 90 percent of the electricity in Africa’s most industrialised economy, has been grappling with labour unrest as it tries to reverse a decade of steep financial decline by cutting costs. It was forced to implement controlled power outages for three days in June after its initial refusal to raise salaries triggered a round of protests. The threat of further outages had appeared to recede after Eskom offered to raise salaries by around 7 percent annually over the next three years, but trade unions want bonuses to be paid before they agree a wage deal. “The current industrial action has negatively impacted plant operations at several power stations,” Eskom said in a statement. “Customers are advised to plan on the assumption that load-shedding will take place,” it added, using a term used in South Africa to refer to controlled power outages. Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said on Twitter that a handful of power generating units were offline, including at the Matla and Arnot power plants. A union source told Reuters that striking workers had affected operations at the Kendal and Duvha power stations. President Cyril Ramaphosa has given his blessing for drastic measures to reform Eskom, and the dispute will test his commitment to reforms aimed at reviving sluggish economic growth. Eskom is regularly cited as a threat to South Africa’s sovereign credit ratings because it has around 270 billion rand ($20 billion) of government-guaranteed debt. The National Union of Mineworkers, one of the largest unions at Eskom, said payment of bonuses was a deal breaker. “Without a bonus, there will be no agreement,” it said in a statement. Eskom said it planned to meet unions again on Friday after talks last week failed to settle the pay dispute.

2018-07-30,"LONDON (Reuters) - Workers at three of Total’s (TOTF.PA) British offshore oil and gas platforms went ahead with a 12-hour strike on Monday, a spokesman for Unite said, with further industrial action planned if no agreement on new rotas is reached. The strike by 45 workers at the Alwyn, Elgin and Dunbar platforms in the North Sea began at 1100 GMT. It followed a 24-hour stoppage at the same sites last Monday but stored crude cushioned against any immediate oil supply disruption. Britain’s largest labor union Unite has also scheduled 24-hour stoppages on Aug. 6 and 20 and a 12-hour strike on Aug. 13 if it is unable agree new rotas with Total. No formal talks with Total were currently planned, Unite said.  The three fields’ oil production contributes about 45,000 to 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) to the Forties and Brent Blend crude streams. Forties and Brent Blend are key oil grades used to set the dated Brent benchmark that prices more than half of the world’s oil trades. Meanwhile on a separate North Sea dispute, Unite said on Monday it would ballot offshore oil workers on whether to accept a new pay deal offered by Aker Solutions (AKSOL.OL). Mariner is a heavy oilfield located 150 kilometers (93 miles) east of the Shetland Islands that is due to start production in the second half of 2018 with a target plateau output of 55,000 barrels per day. A previous ballot voted in favor of a strike at Mariner and  another British union, GMB, said last week its members on Mariner had also voted to stop work.

2018-07-30,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC oil output has risen this month to a 2018 high as Gulf members pumped more after a deal to ease supply curbs and Congo Republic joined the group, a Reuters survey found, although losses from Iran and Libya limited the increase.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has pumped 32.64 million barrels per day in July, the survey on Monday found, up 70,000 bpd from June’s revised level and the highest this year with Congo added. OPEC and allies agreed last month to boost supply as U.S. President Donald Trump urged producers to offset losses caused by new U.S. sanctions on Iran and to dampen prices LCOc1, which this year hit $80 a barrel for the first time since 2014. On June 22-23, OPEC, Russia and other non-members agreed to return to 100 percent compliance with oil output cuts that began in January 2017, after months of underproduction in Venezuela and elsewhere pushed adherence above 160 percent.   Saudi Arabia said the decision would translate into an output rise of about 1 million bpd.  OPEC’s collective adherence with supply targets has slipped to 111 percent in July from a revised 116 percent in June, the survey found, meaning it is still cutting more than agreed.  Following the OPEC decision, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates raised output by 80,000 bpd and 40,000 bpd respectively in July, the survey found. The bulk of the Saudi supply boost appears to have been  delivered in June as Riyadh tapped storage tanks to push supply to 10.60 million bpd, near a record high. The increase infuriated Iran and surprised other OPEC members with its scale. Riyadh has boosted supply in July by a further 50,000 bpd from June’s revised level, the survey found, because domestic crude use in refineries and power plants has risen while exports have held close to June’s rate. Supply in Nigeria, often curbed by unplanned outages, rose by 50,000 bpd. Royal Dutch Shell’s Nigerian venture lifted force majeure on Bonny Light crude exports. Nigeria and Libya were exempt from the original supply-cutting deal. Iraq also increased supply as exports rose from the country’s southern terminals. Among countries with lower output, the biggest drop of 100,000 bpd was in Iran. Exports fell as returning U.S. sanctions discouraged companies from buying the country’s oil. Output in Libya, which remains volatile due to unrest, edged down. Fields in eastern Libya resumed production after a standoff at export terminals ended, but output was cut mid-month at the largest oilfield, Sharara. Production also slipped in Venezuela, where the oil industry is starved of funds because of economic crisis, and in Angola due to lower exports in July against a backdrop of natural decline at oilfields.  The addition of Congo Republic to OPEC in June has added about 320,000 bpd to production and, coupled with the increases by existing members, has lifted OPEC output in July to the highest since October 2017 according to Reuters surveys. Before Congo joined, OPEC had an implied production target for 2018 of 32.78 million bpd, based on cutbacks detailed in late 2016 and Nigeria and Libya’s expectations of 2018 output.  According to the survey, OPEC excluding Congo pumped about 460,000 bpd below this implied target in July. The survey aims to track supply to market and is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Thomson Reuters flows data and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

2018-07-30,"RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia announced last week it was suspending oil shipments through the Red Sea’s Bab al-Mandeb strait after Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthis attacked two ships in the waterway. To date, no other exporters have followed suit. A full blockage of the strategic waterway would virtually halt shipment to Europe and the United States of about 4.8 million barrels per day of crude oil and refined petroleum products.  Western allies backing a Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis in Yemen expressed concern about the attacks, but have not indicated they would take action to secure the strait. That  would risk deeper involvement in a war seen as a proxy battle for regional supremacy between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The threat to shipping in Bab al-Mandeb has been building for some time, with the Houthis targeting Saudi tankers in at least two other attacks this year. It is not unusual to reevaluate security after such an incident, but Riyadh’s announcement also carries a political dimension. Analysts say Saudi Arabia is trying to encourage its Western allies to take more seriously the danger posed by the Houthis and step up support for its war in Yemen, where thousands of air strikes and a limited ground operation have produced only modest results while deepening the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. “Rather than allowing these hostile maneuvers to go unnoticed in the eyes of the world, the Saudi (energy) minister has placed Iran’s subversions of the whole global economy under the spotlight for everyone to see,” said energy consultant Sadad al-Husseini, a former senior executive at Saudi Aramco. “The capture of the port of Hodeidah will go a long way towards putting an end to these disruptions.” Hodeidah, Yemen’s main port, is the target of a coalition offensive launched on June 12 in a bid to cut off the Houthis’ primary supply line. After failing to make major gains, the coalition halted operations on July 1 to give the United Nations a chance to resolve the situation, though some fighting has continued. The suspension of Saudi shipments - with the implied threat of higher oil prices - may also be aimed at pressuring European allies, who have continued to support the nuclear deal with Iran following the U.S. withdrawal in May, to take a stronger stance against Tehran’s ballistic missiles program and support for armed groups across the region. There was no official confirmation that the move was coordinated with Washington but one analyst said it would be astonishing if it were not, given the strategic alliance between the two countries. No party has much appetite for an all-out conflict, but the situation can easily deteriorate. Both the Saudis and the Houthis appear to want to raise the stakes - with different goals in mind. “The Houthis are trying to provoke a situation where there’s a great effort to negotiate an end to the war in Yemen,” said James Dorsey, senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. “The Saudis are trying to create a situation in which the U.S. would in one form or another significantly step up support ... so that they can claim military victory.” The risk is that one side miscalculates, eliciting a response that is stronger than anticipated. “We’re just one missile away somewhere from getting into a more direct confrontation,” said Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets.  Saudi Arabia announced it was halting oil shipments through the Red Sea “until the situation becomes clearer and maritime transition through Bab al-Mandeb is safe”. It is unclear when that will be. But there may not be a big rush as the world’s top oil exporter has other ways to supply European and U.S. markets. Redirecting ships around the southern tip of Africa would cost a lot more in time and money, making it an unlikely alternative. Instead, Saudi Arabia will probably use the Petroline, or East-West Pipeline, through which it transports crude from fields in its Eastern Province to the Red Sea port of Yanbu for export to Europe and North America. It could also charter non-Saudi ships to carry its oil through Bab al-Mandeb, as it does with Asian customers using different routes, industry and trading sources say. Even before last week’s attack, shipping companies had taken extra precautions, including armed guards, more lookouts at sea, sailing faster and increased contact with international navies. A January United Nations report said existing measures would not protect ships against attacks involving waterborne improvised explosive devices, anti-ship missiles, land based anti-tank guided missiles or sea mines. Experts say the United States and other partners could provide naval escorts to tankers and take more steps to reduce the Houthis’ capacity to target shipping, including arms supplies and help with logistics, intelligence and targeting. Increased naval patrols helped curb pirate attacks in the nearby Gulf of Aden a decade ago, but Western allies are less likely to get directly involved this time to avoid being dragged into the Yemen war. While a military approach might deal with the threat to shipping, Elizabeth Dickinson at the International Crisis Group says the only real solution is a settlement to the war in Yemen, which remains elusive. After withdrawing from a 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers, Washington is now pushing countries to end imports of Iranian oil from November. Tehran has warned of counter-measures and threatened to block Gulf oil exports if its own exports are halted. Despite exchanging bellicose threats with President Donald Trump, Iranian officials consider the possibility of a military confrontation with the United States “very low”. Some still believe in the possibility of direct negotiations, but several contacted by Reuters warned that Tehran’s response to a U.S.-initiated war would be costly. “Our military power might not be equal to America’s but Iran’s non-conventional capabilities can and will be a blow to Americans, which will drag them into another quagmire in the region,” said a senior official who asked not to be named. Besides disrupting the flow of oil in the Gulf, insiders say that in a direct confrontation, Iran could target U.S. interests from Jordan to Afghanistan, including troops in Syria and Iraq. During the “tanker war” of the mid-1980s, Gulf waters were mined as Iran and Iraq attacked oil shipments. U.S., British and other foreign forces escorted other nations’ tankers - with some Kuwaiti ships reflagging with the U.S. banner - and conducted limited strikes on Iranian maritime targets. While the Saudis could fly different flags now to try to avoid Houthi attacks, analysts say that would undermine their efforts to project power in the region.

2018-07-30,"HAMBURG/ZURICH (Reuters) - German prosecutors said on Monday they are investigating whether former Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn moved some of his assets out of Germany following an inquiry into his role in the manipulation of anti-pollution tests. Winterkorn was head of VW Group in September 2015 when U.S. regulators uncovered the carmaker’s cheating and he stepped down days after the scandal broke. Prosecutors in Germany and the United States are investigating whether top Volkswagen managers knew about, and could have prevented, the pollution breaches. “The circumstances around possible transfers of wealth may play a role examining the question whether the accused Winterkorn knew about diesel manipulations and potentially reacted in some way,” the prosecutor’s office in the German city of Braunschweig said in a statement on Monday. Felix Doerr, a lawyer representing Winterkorn, did not respond to requests seeking comment. Winterkorn has previously denied advanced knowledge of emissions fraud or failing in his duty to inform investors in a timely manner. Bild am Sonntag reported on Sunday that transfers worth 7 million euros were made on January 31, 2017 from a bank in Nuremberg, Bavaria to an auditor’s office in Munich. Around 3.4 million euros of this ended up at Bank Vontobel in Switzerland, the paper said. The Braunschweig prosecutor’s office said it was not investigating Winterkorn for tax evasion, but had passed on some of its findings to the tax authorities.  Bank Vontobel said on Monday it complies with all laws and rules, and does not comment on individual clients or accounts. The Swiss financial markets regulator declined to comment. Prosecutors are examining whether Winterkorn was attempting to move money to a safe haven ahead of a possible prosecution, Bild am Sonntag added. Volkswagen struck a deal with the U.S. Department of Justice On January 11, 2017, pleading guilty to criminal and civil penalties and agreeing to pay $4.3 billion in fines and settlements. In total, VW has paid out at least $25 billion relating to the scandal. The Department of Justice then pressed to indict Winterkorn on March 14, 2018 and made public their intention to have him arrested on May 3, 2018. Switzerland effectively abolished bank secrecy in 2017 by agreeing to an automatic exchange of information with Germany concerning bank accounts.

The royal family has traditionally spent much of the summer outside the country in places such as the French Riviera, Marbella in southern Spain and Tangier, Morocco. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced plans for the 26,500 square km (10,230 square mile) futuristic high-tech hub last year as part of reforms aimed at creating jobs, encouraging foreign investment and permitting new freedoms for Saudis steeped in religious puritanism and state dependency. The authorities have announced few details since then and while some companies, including Japan’s Softbank, have said they are prepared to invest in NEOM, major, concrete business ventures have not yet been announced. A statement carried by the state news agency SPA said the king would “spend some time in rest and recreation” in NEOM but gave no details.  It did not specify where the 82-year-old monarch would stay. However, in February, sources told Reuters that the government had asked local construction companies to build five palaces for the king, crown prince and other senior royals on the Red Sea coast about 150 km (95 miles) west of the city of Tabuk. These would be among the first contracts awarded for NEOM. A design document seen by Reuters shows opulent buildings with modern and traditional Moroccan-style architecture featuring Islamic designs and colourful ceramic tiles. The complex of palaces is set to include helipads, a marina and a golf course. The royal court did not immediately respond to questions about the current status of construction in NEOM, which is largely inaccessible to civilians.

2018-07-30,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Monday, with U.S. crude futures jumping more than 2 percent, as traders continued to focus on supply disruptions and a possible hit to crude output from U.S. sanctions on Iran.   October Brent crude futures LCOV8, the most actively traded contract, settled at $75.55 a barrel, up 79 cents. The September Brent contract, which expires on Tuesday, settled at $74.97, up 68 cents, or 0.9 percent. Volumes in an expiring contract tend to dwindle in the last few days before it goes off the board.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (WTI) CLc1 rose $1.44, or 2.1 percent, to settle at $70.13 a barrel. WTI rose on expectations that U.S. inventories fell last week and worries that an outage at a Syncrude facility in Canada will not be solved as soon as expected, traders said. “We’re just getting tighter and tighter here in the U.S. in terms of supply, particularly in Cushing,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital Management in New York. “That’s why you’re seeing WTI rise.” Crude inventories at the Oklahoma, delivery point for WTI have been dwindling, in part due to the situation at the Syncrude facility that has reduced the flow of oil into the hub.  Stocks at the Cushing dropped to 23.7 million barrels, the lowest since November 2014 in the week to July 20. [EIA/S] Energy information company Genscape, however, said that inventories at the Cushing rose almost 200,000 barrels, or nearly 1 percent, from Tuesday to Friday last week, according to traders. Oil prices have rebounded from recent lows over the last two weeks, as looming sanctions on Iran have already started to curtail exports from that country. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he would meet with Iran’s President, Hassan Rouhani. “The best-case scenario is that the U.S. provides meaningful sanction waivers in the run-up to the mid-term elections and Iran can get away with a loss of around 500-700,000 barrels per day of exports,” PVM Oil Associates Tamas Varga said in a note. The market held gains even after a Reuters survey showed the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries increased production in July. OPEC hiked production 70,000 barrels per day to 32.64 million bpd, a 2018 high. Further supply increases could offset production outages and pressure prices.  Prices remain buoyed by a tight supply outlook, with global inventories down from record highs in 2017 and U.S. inventories at three-year lows, said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.  “If you take a step back and look at where global inventories and U.S. inventories are, you’re seeing a tighter picture than where we were a year ago,” McGillian said. “Overall, I think the market is in the process of stabilizing.” Saudi Arabia last week said it was suspending oil shipments through the Red Sea’s Bab al-Mandeb strait, one of the world’s most important tanker routes, after Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthis attacked two ships in the waterway.  “The ongoing concerns about the lack of supply coming out of the Bab al-Mandeb strait on top of continued disruption in Venezuela seems to be giving the market momentum, not to mention the potential loss of Iranian supply,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.

Most major currencies stuck to narrow trading ranges ahead of central bank decisions. The Bank of Japan ends a two-day meeting on Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve concludes its policy meeting on Wednesday, and the Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates on Thursday. Shares in Europe fell, led by a 2.9 percent decline in software maker SAP SE (SAPG.DE) and a 2.5 percent drop in French industrial gases company Air Liquide (AIRP.PA). The FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 of leading European shares closed down 0.3 percent.

Industrials, energy and materials led gainers on Wall Street, with Caterpillar (CAT.N) raising its full-year outlook after second-quarter earnings nearly doubled and beat expectations, helped by robust global demand for its equipment. A revival in global growth may lift stocks even as tech shares stop leading the market higher, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. “You’re seeing a change in leadership in the market, and that’s the underlying story here.

2018-07-30,"(Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) has hired an investment bank to organize an auction for its digital assets, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday citing people familiar with the matter. GE’s multibillion-dollar digital business, which includes its Predix software system and applications, has been struggling with technical issues and weakening sales.   GE has been seeking partners to invest in GE Digital as it narrowed the target markets for the division and abandoned plans to build a cloud platform, instead partnering with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) clouds.  Faced with cash constraints and falling profits at its large power business, GE chose to reduce investment in the digital unit and focus on partnerships.  The Wall Street Journal report did not reveal the exact assets for sale or the potential deal value.GE declined to comment. Former GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt invested more than $4 billion in GE Digital and placed it at the strategic center of what he called GE’s new role as a “digital industrial company.”  But technical issues and competition from less costly systems slowed the unit’s growth, forcing GE to shift strategy.  The unit, which became a standalone business in 2015, has not reported profit and loss as other GE units do. It posted revenue of $4 billion last year, a 12 percent increase from 2016, GE said.  But growth has slowed. Revenue growth was flat in the latest quarter, compared with a year ago, and new orders fell 23 percent, GE said earlier this month.  GE also has been laying off programmers at the GE Digital’s San Ramon, California, headquarters.      The potential sale of digital assets comes amid a broader GE restructuring. The Boston-based conglomerate said in June that it plans to spin off its healthcare business and divest its stake in oil-services firm Baker Hughes (BHGE.N), effectively breaking up the 126-year-old company.  The slimmed-down company under Chief Executive John Flannery will focus on jet engines, power plants and renewable energy, which GE hopes will reward battered shareholders who have seen the stock lose more than half its value over the past 20 years. GE shares were up 0.7 percent at $13.14 in afternoon trading on Monday.

2018-07-30,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Monday he was organising a conference to look for ways to stabilise Libya, a main departure point for migrants from North Africa trying to reach Europe. “In agreement with President (Donald) Trump, I’m going to organise a conference on Libya,” Conte told reporters at the White House after meeting with the U.S. president. “We would like to deal (with) and discuss all of the issues related to the Libyan people, involving all of the stakeholders, actors, protagonists in the whole of the Mediterranean,” said Conte, who took office last month promising a crackdown on immigration. Italy has told its allies it wants to hold an international conference on Libya this autumn and Conte was eager to get Trump’s blessing for the gathering at their meeting on Monday. Italy is competing with neighbouring France over how best to deal with Libya, which has been wracked by violence for years. Conte believes a conference in Rome, backed by the United States, will help Rome establish itself as the major interlocutor for Libya’s warring factions. After their meeting, Conte said Trump had agreed Italy would become “a reference point in Europe and the main interlocutor for the main issues that need to be faced ... with particular reference to Libya.” “We are going to discuss economic aspects, but also social aspects: the need for protection of civil rights; the problem of constitutional process - of issuing and passing laws so as to enable Libya, in particular, to get to democratic elections in a condition of the utmost stability,” Conte said.

Eskom, which supplies more than 90 percent of the electricity in Africa’s most industrialised economy, has been grappling with labour unrest as it tries to reverse a decade of steep financial decline by cutting costs. It was forced to implement controlled power outages for three days in June after its initial refusal to raise salaries triggered a round of protests. The threat of further outages had appeared to recede after Eskom offered to raise salaries by around 7 percent annually over the next three years, but trade unions want bonuses to be paid before they agree a wage deal. “The current industrial action has negatively impacted plant operations at several power stations,” Eskom said in a statement. “Customers are advised to plan on the assumption that load-shedding will take place,” it added, using a term used in South Africa to refer to controlled power outages. Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said on Twitter that a handful of power generating units were offline, including at the Matla and Arnot power plants. A union source told Reuters that striking workers had affected operations at the Kendal and Duvha power stations. President Cyril Ramaphosa has given his blessing for drastic measures to reform Eskom, and the dispute will test his commitment to reforms aimed at reviving sluggish economic growth. Eskom is regularly cited as a threat to South Africa’s sovereign credit ratings because it has around 270 billion rand ($20 billion) of government-guaranteed debt. The National Union of Mineworkers, one of the largest unions at Eskom, said payment of bonuses was a deal breaker. “Without a bonus, there will be no agreement,” it said in a statement. Eskom said it planned to meet unions again on Friday after talks last week failed to settle the pay dispute.

2018-07-30,"LONDON (Reuters) - Workers at three of Total’s (TOTF.PA) British offshore oil and gas platforms went ahead with a 12-hour strike on Monday, a spokesman for Unite said, with further industrial action planned if no agreement on new rotas is reached. The strike by 45 workers at the Alwyn, Elgin and Dunbar platforms in the North Sea began at 1100 GMT. It followed a 24-hour stoppage at the same sites last Monday but stored crude cushioned against any immediate oil supply disruption. Britain’s largest labor union Unite has also scheduled 24-hour stoppages on Aug. 6 and 20 and a 12-hour strike on Aug. 13 if it is unable agree new rotas with Total. No formal talks with Total were currently planned, Unite said.  The three fields’ oil production contributes about 45,000 to 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) to the Forties and Brent Blend crude streams. Forties and Brent Blend are key oil grades used to set the dated Brent benchmark that prices more than half of the world’s oil trades. Meanwhile on a separate North Sea dispute, Unite said on Monday it would ballot offshore oil workers on whether to accept a new pay deal offered by Aker Solutions (AKSOL.OL). Mariner is a heavy oilfield located 150 kilometers (93 miles) east of the Shetland Islands that is due to start production in the second half of 2018 with a target plateau output of 55,000 barrels per day.

2018-07-30,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC oil output has risen this month to a 2018 high as Gulf members pumped more after a deal to ease supply curbs and Congo Republic joined the group, a Reuters survey found, although losses from Iran and Libya limited the increase.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has pumped 32.64 million barrels per day in July, the survey on Monday found, up 70,000 bpd from June’s revised level and the highest this year with Congo added. OPEC and allies agreed last month to boost supply as U.S. President Donald Trump urged producers to offset losses caused by new U.S. sanctions on Iran and to dampen prices LCOc1, which this year hit $80 a barrel for the first time since 2014. On June 22-23, OPEC, Russia and other non-members agreed to return to 100 percent compliance with oil output cuts that began in January 2017, after months of underproduction in Venezuela and elsewhere pushed adherence above 160 percent.   Saudi Arabia said the decision would translate into an output rise of about 1 million bpd.  OPEC’s collective adherence with supply targets has slipped to 111 percent in July from a revised 116 percent in June, the survey found, meaning it is still cutting more than agreed.  Following the OPEC decision, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates raised output by 80,000 bpd and 40,000 bpd respectively in July, the survey found. The bulk of the Saudi supply boost appears to have been  delivered in June as Riyadh tapped storage tanks to push supply to 10.60 million bpd, near a record high. The increase infuriated Iran and surprised other OPEC members with its scale. Riyadh has boosted supply in July by a further 50,000 bpd from June’s revised level, the survey found, because domestic crude use in refineries and power plants has risen while exports have held close to June’s rate. Supply in Nigeria, often curbed by unplanned outages, rose by 50,000 bpd. Royal Dutch Shell’s Nigerian venture lifted force majeure on Bonny Light crude exports. Nigeria and Libya were exempt from the original supply-cutting deal. Iraq also increased supply as exports rose from the country’s southern terminals. Among countries with lower output, the biggest drop of 100,000 bpd was in Iran. Exports fell as returning U.S. sanctions discouraged companies from buying the country’s oil. Output in Libya, which remains volatile due to unrest, edged down. Fields in eastern Libya resumed production after a standoff at export terminals ended, but output was cut mid-month at the largest oilfield, Sharara. Production also slipped in Venezuela, where the oil industry is starved of funds because of economic crisis, and in Angola due to lower exports in July against a backdrop of natural decline at oilfields.  The addition of Congo Republic to OPEC in June has added about 320,000 bpd to production and, coupled with the increases by existing members, has lifted OPEC output in July to the highest since October 2017 according to Reuters surveys. Before Congo joined, OPEC had an implied production target for 2018 of 32.78 million bpd, based on cutbacks detailed in late 2016 and Nigeria and Libya’s expectations of 2018 output.  According to the survey, OPEC excluding Congo pumped about 460,000 bpd below this implied target in July. The survey aims to track supply to market and is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Thomson Reuters flows data and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

2018-07-30,"RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia announced last week it was suspending oil shipments through the Red Sea’s Bab al-Mandeb strait after Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthis attacked two ships in the waterway. To date, no other exporters have followed suit. A full blockage of the strategic waterway would virtually halt shipment to Europe and the United States of about 4.8 million barrels per day of crude oil and refined petroleum products.  Western allies backing a Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis in Yemen expressed concern about the attacks, but have not indicated they would take action to secure the strait. That  would risk deeper involvement in a war seen as a proxy battle for regional supremacy between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The threat to shipping in Bab al-Mandeb has been building for some time, with the Houthis targeting Saudi tankers in at least two other attacks this year. It is not unusual to reevaluate security after such an incident, but Riyadh’s announcement also carries a political dimension. Analysts say Saudi Arabia is trying to encourage its Western allies to take more seriously the danger posed by the Houthis and step up support for its war in Yemen, where thousands of air strikes and a limited ground operation have produced only modest results while deepening the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. “Rather than allowing these hostile maneuvers to go unnoticed in the eyes of the world, the Saudi (energy) minister has placed Iran’s subversions of the whole global economy under the spotlight for everyone to see,” said energy consultant Sadad al-Husseini, a former senior executive at Saudi Aramco. “The capture of the port of Hodeidah will go a long way towards putting an end to these disruptions.” Hodeidah, Yemen’s main port, is the target of a coalition offensive launched on June 12 in a bid to cut off the Houthis’ primary supply line. After failing to make major gains, the coalition halted operations on July 1 to give the United Nations a chance to resolve the situation, though some fighting has continued. The suspension of Saudi shipments - with the implied threat of higher oil prices - may also be aimed at pressuring European allies, who have continued to support the nuclear deal with Iran following the U.S. withdrawal in May, to take a stronger stance against Tehran’s ballistic missiles program and support for armed groups across the region. There was no official confirmation that the move was coordinated with Washington but one analyst said it would be astonishing if it were not, given the strategic alliance between the two countries. No party has much appetite for an all-out conflict, but the situation can easily deteriorate. Both the Saudis and the Houthis appear to want to raise the stakes - with different goals in mind. “The Houthis are trying to provoke a situation where there’s a great effort to negotiate an end to the war in Yemen,” said James Dorsey, senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. “The Saudis are trying to create a situation in which the U.S. would in one form or another significantly step up support ... so that they can claim military victory.” The risk is that one side miscalculates, eliciting a response that is stronger than anticipated. “We’re just one missile away somewhere from getting into a more direct confrontation,” said Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets.  Saudi Arabia announced it was halting oil shipments through the Red Sea “until the situation becomes clearer and maritime transition through Bab al-Mandeb is safe”. It is unclear when that will be. But there may not be a big rush as the world’s top oil exporter has other ways to supply European and U.S. markets. Redirecting ships around the southern tip of Africa would cost a lot more in time and money, making it an unlikely alternative. Instead, Saudi Arabia will probably use the Petroline, or East-West Pipeline, through which it transports crude from fields in its Eastern Province to the Red Sea port of Yanbu for export to Europe and North America. It could also charter non-Saudi ships to carry its oil through Bab al-Mandeb, as it does with Asian customers using different routes, industry and trading sources say. Even before last week’s attack, shipping companies had taken extra precautions, including armed guards, more lookouts at sea, sailing faster and increased contact with international navies. A January United Nations report said existing measures would not protect ships against attacks involving waterborne improvised explosive devices, anti-ship missiles, land based anti-tank guided missiles or sea mines. Experts say the United States and other partners could provide naval escorts to tankers and take more steps to reduce the Houthis’ capacity to target shipping, including arms supplies and help with logistics, intelligence and targeting. Increased naval patrols helped curb pirate attacks in the nearby Gulf of Aden a decade ago, but Western allies are less likely to get directly involved this time to avoid being dragged into the Yemen war. While a military approach might deal with the threat to shipping, Elizabeth Dickinson at the International Crisis Group says the only real solution is a settlement to the war in Yemen, which remains elusive. After withdrawing from a 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers, Washington is now pushing countries to end imports of Iranian oil from November. Tehran has warned of counter-measures and threatened to block Gulf oil exports if its own exports are halted. Despite exchanging bellicose threats with President Donald Trump, Iranian officials consider the possibility of a military confrontation with the United States “very low”. Some still believe in the possibility of direct negotiations, but several contacted by Reuters warned that Tehran’s response to a U.S.-initiated war would be costly. “Our military power might not be equal to America’s but Iran’s non-conventional capabilities can and will be a blow to Americans, which will drag them into another quagmire in the region,” said a senior official who asked not to be named. Besides disrupting the flow of oil in the Gulf, insiders say that in a direct confrontation, Iran could target U.S. interests from Jordan to Afghanistan, including troops in Syria and Iraq. During the “tanker war” of the mid-1980s, Gulf waters were mined as Iran and Iraq attacked oil shipments. U.S., British and other foreign forces escorted other nations’ tankers - with some Kuwaiti ships reflagging with the U.S. banner - and conducted limited strikes on Iranian maritime targets. While the Saudis could fly different flags now to try to avoid Houthi attacks, analysts say that would undermine their efforts to project power in the region.

2018-07-30,"HAMBURG/ZURICH (Reuters) - German prosecutors said on Monday they are investigating whether former Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn moved some of his assets out of Germany following an inquiry into his role in the manipulation of anti-pollution tests. Winterkorn was head of VW Group in September 2015 when U.S. regulators uncovered the carmaker’s cheating and he stepped down days after the scandal broke. Prosecutors in Germany and the United States are investigating whether top Volkswagen managers knew about, and could have prevented, the pollution breaches. “The circumstances around possible transfers of wealth may play a role examining the question whether the accused Winterkorn knew about diesel manipulations and potentially reacted in some way,” the prosecutor’s office in the German city of Braunschweig said in a statement on Monday. Felix Doerr, a lawyer representing Winterkorn, did not respond to requests seeking comment. Winterkorn has previously denied advanced knowledge of emissions fraud or failing in his duty to inform investors in a timely manner. Bild am Sonntag reported on Sunday that transfers worth 7 million euros were made on January 31, 2017 from a bank in Nuremberg, Bavaria to an auditor’s office in Munich. Around 3.4 million euros of this ended up at Bank Vontobel in Switzerland, the paper said. The Braunschweig prosecutor’s office said it was not investigating Winterkorn for tax evasion, but had passed on some of its findings to the tax authorities.  Bank Vontobel said on Monday it complies with all laws and rules, and does not comment on individual clients or accounts. The Swiss financial markets regulator declined to comment. Prosecutors are examining whether Winterkorn was attempting to move money to a safe haven ahead of a possible prosecution, Bild am Sonntag added. Volkswagen struck a deal with the U.S. Department of Justice On January 11, 2017, pleading guilty to criminal and civil penalties and agreeing to pay $4.3 billion in fines and settlements. In total, VW has paid out at least $25 billion relating to the scandal. The Department of Justice then pressed to indict Winterkorn on March 14, 2018 and made public their intention to have him arrested on May 3, 2018. Switzerland effectively abolished bank secrecy in 2017 by agreeing to an automatic exchange of information with Germany concerning bank accounts.

2018-07-30,"(Adds Wall Street futures, details, updates prices) * Investors await Japan, UK, U.S. central bank decisions * Apple results eyed as U.S. tech disappointments sour mood * Japan government bonds sold off ahead of policy meeting * Dow Jones futures gain on Caterpillar earnings By Danilo Masoni MILAN, July 30 (Reuters) - World stocks and the dollar were broadly steady on Monday as a busy week of central bank meetings and company updates began, while Japanese government bonds sold off before possible monetary policy tweaks. Disappointing updates from U.S. tech heavyweights overshadowed solid results elsewhere, helping knock European shares off six-week highs, while a MSCI index that tracks shares in 47 countries pared losses to trade flat. “Quarterly results continue to be more than good overall, but markets appear to be particularly sensitive to the sporadic negative updates, especially from tech stocks,” JCI Capital strategist and fund manager Alessandro Balsotti said. “Meanwhile before the August lull - although that’s not always the case for markets - we’re bracing for an intense week, packed with central bank meetings and macro data,” he said. On Monday, industrial heavyweight Caterpillar posted higher quarterly profit that beat market forecasts and upgraded the full-year profit outlook, citing robust global demand. The encouraging update helped Dow futures rise, while Nasdaq and S&P futures remained under pressure from technology stocks. Apple. is also among the 140 S&P 500 companies that report results this week. The iPhone maker will be closely watched after disappointing results from Facebook and Twitter shook confidence in tech resilience. JPMorgan reported relatively aggressive moves into “value” stocks - banks, in particular - and away from shares leveraged to economic growth. “Tech really began cracking on Tuesday before the floodgates opened on Friday,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note. “The rotation will likely continue, benefiting value categories at the expense of momentum/tech as rates are biased higher,” they said. “Europe’s higher weighting to banks/resource will help it vs the U.S.” In Europe, 70 companies on the pan-regional STOXX 600 benchmark are due to report their updates this week with figures from big banks, including BNP Paribas, Intesa Sanpaolo and Lloyds in the spotlight. According to I/B/E/S data, second-quarter earnings of companies on the STOXX are expected to have risen 7.4 percent. Earnings for the S&P 500 are forecast to have risen 22.6 percent with more than four out of five companies, which have already reported, beating analyst expectations. At 43 percent, earnings beats in Europe have lagged those on Wall Street. Away from earnings, the top focus will be three central bank meetings. Bank of Japan and the Bank of England will be eyed for possible policy tweaks, while the U.S. Federal Reserve is unlikely to deliver surprises. The Fed meets on Tuesday and Wednesday and is expected to keep rates unchanged and reaffirm the outlook for further rate rises. The market is almost fully priced for a hike in September and leaning towards a further move before the end of the year. The BoJ meeting that ends on Tuesday will be closely watched amid speculation the central bank might tweak its massive asset-buying programme and take a step towards less monetary policy accommodation. As the market tried to test the central bank’s intention, Japanese government bonds sagged, sending the benchmark 10-year yield to its highest level for almost a year and a half. That forced the BoJ to conduct a special bond-buying operation for two sessions in a row and to end up buying a record amount to stem rising bond yields. On currency markets, the chance of a BoJ shift has sent the yen higher in the last week or so, leaving the dollar around 111.07 yen from this month’s 113.18 peak. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar moved in tight ranges. It last traded at 94.541, having repeatedly failed to clear resistance around 95.652 this month. The euro edged up to $1.1681 against the dollar, after the European Central Bank reaffirmed last week that rates would remain low through the summer of 2019. Meanwhile, euro zone government bond yields rose across the board after a strong Italian auction boosted demand for Italian debt at the expense of higher-rated markets in the bloc. In Asia, eyes were on China’s yuan after it suffered the longest weekly losing streak since November 2015. It weakened further, slipping past 6.8400 per dollar for the first time since June last year before paring losses. In commodity markets, oil prices rose as investors remained cautious over the supply outlook, having gained nearly 5 percent in price since the middle of July. U.S. crude added 132 cents to $70.01, while Brent rose 73 cents to $74.83 a barrel. In metals, copper prices fell as investors focused instead on economic data this week expected to show slowing growth in top metals consumer China. Spot gold eased 0.07 percent to $1,221.48.

2018-07-30,"LONDON (Reuters) - Delays to the planned sale of Toshiba’s (6502.T) NuGen nuclear project in Britain have prompted a review of the roles of 60 direct employees, who are mainly based in Manchester, raising further doubts over its future. The plant in Moorside, north-west England, was expected to provide around 7 percent of Britain’s electricity when built, but has faced several setbacks after Toshiba’s nuclear arm Westinghouse went bankrupt last year. Following the Westinghouse bankruptcy, NuGen joint venture partner Engie (ENGIE.PA) pulled out of the project, leaving the Japanese firm searching for new investors. Toshiba put NuGen up for sale and South Korea’s Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO) (015760.KS) was chosen as preferred bidder last year, but the process has stalled.  Britain needs to invest in new capacity to replace aging coal and nuclear reactors that are due to close in the 2020s, but large new plants have struggled to get off the ground due to high costs and weak electricity prices. “Toshiba has pursued a sale of NuGen to KEPCO and the prolonged time it has taken reach a conclusion has required NuGen to undertake a review,” a spokesman for NuGen said. “As such additional options are being pursued for NuGen’s future direction to deliver the next generation of nuclear new build in the UK,” he said. NuGen has around 60 direct employees, mostly based in Manchester, while the roles of around 40 contractors would also be placed under a 30 day consultation period later this week, the spokesman added. Britain’s government has yet to announce any kind of deal for the NuGen project. “We continue to engage with new build developers, though the detail of these discussions is commercially confidential,” a spokeswoman for the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy department said. Another plant, to be built by a unit of Japan’s Hitachi Ltd (6501.T), has also struggled to find funding, leading the British government to consider direct investment.  However, EDF’s (EDF.PA) Hinkley Point C will be the first new nuclear plant built in the country in more than twenty years after securing additional backing from the French government, investment from China General Nuclear Power Corp, and a long-term power price guarantee from Britain. The government has been criticised for being too generous in the terms it has set for this deal.

2018-07-30,"(Repeats item with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: U.S. LNG exports to China are falling: tmsnrt.rs/2JyaAsX By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, July 30 (Reuters) - Prices for spot cargoes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in top-consuming region Asia have become more volatile amid a northern hemisphere heat wave, China’s switch to cleaner fuels and a side-helping of Donald Trump-inspired trade disruptions. The spot LNG price LNG-AS for September delivery in North Asia rose to $9.75 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in the week to July 27, the first increase in six weeks. Soaring temperatures in Japan and South Korea were behind the move higher, as utilities ramped up electricity output to meet demand for air-conditioning. Japan even resorted to restarting old and dirty oil-fired power plants, in addition to boosting natural gas generation. The boost to prices last week was the latest turn in a spot LNG market that has become more volatile and sensitive to even relatively modest moves in supply and demand. The spot price reached $11.60 per mmBtu in mid-June, an unusual occurrence as it meant the peak summer price exceeded that for the previous winter for the first time since 2012. LNG has a seasonal pattern, with the peak price usually occurring in the northern winter, followed by a lower high in summer and troughs in autumn and spring. The mid-June price peak was built on strong demand from China, the world’s No. 2 importer, whose rapid growth took it past South Korea last year, although it still has some way to go to dislodge Japan from the top spot. Some supply outages at the same time in major producer Australia, as well as Malaysia and the United States, also drove prices higher in June. While the spot price has shifted up a gear, the extra demand has yet to show up in trade flows. Northeast Asia, which includes the three top LNG buyers of Japan, China and South Korea, is on track to import around 14.2 million tonnes of LNG in July, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters. This would be largely steady to June’s 14.8 million tonnes and 14.5 million tonnes in July last year. Looking at the breakdown by country shows Japan on track to import about 6.4 million tonnes in July, up from June’s 6.03 million, but below last July’s 7.1 million. China will import around 3.85 million tonnes in July, down a tad from June’s 3.95 million, but up from 2.91 million in July of 2017. South Korea’s July imports are headed for 2.5 million tonnes, a 26 percent slump from June’s 3.4 million and also well below the 3 million from July a year ago. While China is still posting large year-on-year gains, it seems current demand for LNG is largely being driven by Japan. The dynamics of LNG flows are also shifting, partly as a result of U.S. President Donald Trump’s escalating trade dispute with China. While trade in LNG isn’t restricted in any way as yet, it seems China is quietly discouraging its major oil and gas companies from buying from the United States. Only two cargoes arrived China in July from the United States, carrying just 0.13 million tonnes of the super-chilled fuel. This was an unchanged number of cargoes from June, but down on five vessels that arrived in May, and well below seven that unloaded in January this year. The winner in China is Australia, with imports totalling to 12.4 million tonnes in the first seven months of the year, up from 9.1 million tonnes in the same period last year. Australia has also upped its shipments to Japan, with 15.9 million tonnes arriving in the first seven months, up from 14.6 million in the same period in 2017. U.S. LNG suppliers have had some success in shipping to Asian countries other than China, with Japan taking three cargoes in July, down from four in June and level with May. South Korea brought in four U.S. cargoes in July, the same number as June and down from five in May. But with Chinese demand for U.S. LNG under a cloud, it’s likely that U.S. producers will have to offer more competitive prices to other buyers in Asia, or perhaps in Europe. This may prompt changes in the way LNG producers such as Qatar and Australia market spot cargoes, increasing volatility in a market that has shifted from being fairly predictable to one characterised by quicker and larger price swings.

2018-07-30,"(Corrects paragraph 8 to say production will rise by (not to) 3 million tonnes.) By Marwa Rashad RIYADH, July 29 (Reuters) - Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC), the world’s fourth-biggest petrochemicals company, said on Sunday it expects positive growth in the second half of this year, backed by an increase in production and enhanced global economic outlook. The comments came after SABIC reported an 81 percent leap in second-quarter net profit, citing higher selling prices and a jump in sales volumes. The first half of 2018 was “very positive” and SABIC expects the second half of the year to be “equally positive,” CEO Yousef al-Benyan told a news conference. SABIC has been a focus of investor attention after Reuters reported earlier this month that Saudi national oil giant Aramco aimed to buy a stake in SABIC, possibly taking the entire 70 percent holding owned by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, Public Investment Fund (PIF). Aramco subsequently confirmed the report. Benyan said on Sunday that talks on the potential acquisition of a stake in his company are taking place solely between Aramco and PIF. “Hard to expect anything in this regard — Aramco-PIF talks are between an owner and a future investor,” Yousef al-Benyan told a news conference. “I can assure you we have trust in our regulators.” SABIC posted a net profit of 6.70 billion riyals ($1.79 billion) in the three months to June 30, up from 3.71 billion riyals in the year-earlier period, beating average analyst forecasts of a 5.8 billion riyals net profit. Benyan said the company’s production rose by about 1.5 million tonnes in the first half of the year and is expected to rise by three million tonnes by year-end. Quarterly sales climbed 26 percent from a year earlier to 43.28 billion riyals, and were up three percent from the previous quarter. SABIC shares edged down 0.6 percent by 0905 GMT, dragging the Saudi index 0.9 percent down, but the stock is richly valued at over 20 times trailing earnings. SABIC’s results are closely tied to oil prices and global economic growth because its products — plastics, fertilisers and metals — are used extensively in construction, agriculture, industry and the manufacturing of consumer goods. The petrochemical giant has plans to expand its presence in global markets; specifically in North America, China and North Africa, Benyan said, adding that the company is looking at various options, without giving further details. In Europe, the company is still committed to its investment in Clariant, and is awaiting antitrust approvals for acquiring a 25 percent stake in the Swiss speciality chemical maker which was announced in January, Benyan said. Earlier this month, Clariant CEO said his company’s update on its ties with SABIC is likely to be delayed as antitrust approvals take longer than expected.

2018-07-30,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2K3n5Nn By John Kemp LONDON, July 30 (Reuters) - Hedge funds appear to have completed the recent wave of liquidation, with bullish positions increased slightly last week after heavy falls the week before, helping to steady the main crude oil benchmarks. Hedge funds and other money managers raised their net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by 37 million barrels in the week to July 24. The boost was a marked turnaround from the previous week, when net long positions were cut by 178 million barrels, one of the heaviest bouts of liquidation on record. In the most recent week, portfolio managers raised net long positions in Brent (+14 million barrels), U.S. gasoline (+11 million), U.S. heating oil (+12 million) and European gasoil (+11 million). The only selling came in NYMEX and ICE WTI, where net long positions were reduced by 11 million barrels last week, according to data published by regulators and exchanges (tmsnrt.rs/2K3n5Nn). The recent wave of liquidation, which started in late April, and accelerated in mid-July, has blown off some of the froth from the top of the market. Portfolio managers remain exceptionally bullish on the outlook, but some of the momentum-chasing and more tactical long positions have been squared up. Long positions in the petroleum complex outnumber short ones by more than 1 billion barrels, but that is down from a net long position of more than 1.4 billion barrels three months ago. Long positions still outnumber shorts by a ratio of more than 9:1, leaving the market stretched, but that is down from almost 14:1 at the peak. For now, bullishness about supply disruptions, the impact of Iran sanctions, and strong growth in oil consumption is outweighing concerns about the global economic outlook and the impact of high prices on oil demand.

2018-07-30,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes in text) * Companies harness big data, hi-tech to boost shale profits * BP’s $10 bln BHP shale buyout reflects confidence in sector By Ernest Scheyder and Ron Bousso LUFKIN, Texas/LONDON, July 30 (Reuters) - In the pine forests of eastern Texas, oilfield workers equipped with virtual-reality goggles are helping BP’s shale business turn a profit for the first time. Thousands of automated wells feed data on their performance into the firm’s supercomputers each evening. If they show a need for maintenance, an Uber-style system summons a subcontracted repair firm to keep the shale wells flowing at optimal output and minimal cost. Such technology has helped slash BP’s shale oil and natural gas production costs by 34 percent over five years. The shale business turned a profit for the first time in 2017, BP said, although the company declined to disclose the figure. BP’s progress in shale underpinned its $10.5 billion acquisition last week of BHP Billiton’s U.S. shale operations. The deal highlighted BP’s newfound confidence in a sector that has challenged oil majors, which initially struggled to adjust to the quick pace and fast-evolving methods used to tap shale with horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. BP and other majors that had traditionally focused on large, multi-year conventional drilling projects - such as Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron - were left behind when the shale boom took off a decade ago. The British energy giant is now catching up with smaller rivals, using technology and its institutional knowledge from global operations to push shale into a second phase that it hopes will reward its massive scale over the agility of smaller competitors. “We spent the last four years retooling our business and getting ready for this opportunity,” David Lawler, who heads BP’s shale business, said in a call with analysts after the BHP deal announcement. “We’re at the lowest production costs we’ve seen in many years. We’ll take that model, put that to work on these (BHP) assets and dramatically improve production and performance.” BP faces other large rivals in the race to grow U.S. shale production and profits, including Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron, Shell and Norway’s Equinor. All are expanding drilling and acquisitions, particularly in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oil field and the center of the shale revolution. They aim to capitalize on the vast resources unearthed by new drilling technologies, which also allow companies to start and stop production quickly in response to market shifts. That’s a key advantage over the long-term commitments of billions of dollars required by offshore oil or liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects. The BHP deal will transform BP into one of the world’s biggest shale oil and gas producers. BP’s total shale output will increase from 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) to more than 500,000 boed. Its reserves will jump 57 percent to 12.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent. BP’s output of shale oil - which is worth more than natural gas - is poised to rise from about 10,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd) to about 200,000 bpd by the middle of the next decade. The deal, BP’s first major acquisition in 20 years, also marked a watershed moment for the company in the United States as it looks to leave behind the $65 billion fallout from the deadly 2010 explosion of its Deepwater Horizon rig in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The BHP deal will also re-establish BP as a major player in the Permian Basin. BP had sold all of its assets there to Apache Corp in August 2010, right after the Gulf disaster. Today, BP operates more than 1,000 shale wells that produce mostly natural gas in the Haynesville basin, which straddles eastern Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana. It has used the data from its automated wells to create a streamlined system that farms out maintenance to a fleet of lower-cost contractors. The firm now orders up repairs much in the same way a homeowner uses a mobile app to hire a maintenance person or a passenger summons an Uber for a ride. BP puts repair work out for bid to pre-approved contractors, who then compete for jobs. Each contractor is rated after completing the work, and those with high rankings have a better chance of getting hired again. “This means we’re not hiring and firing staff all the time depending on market conditions,” said Brian Pugh, chief operating office of BP’s shale division, which the company created as a stand-alone unit in 2015. BP equips field staff and contractors with augmented reality goggles to make repairs more efficient, modeling its methods in part on “Pokemon Go,” a popular video game where virtual images appear to be in real-world surroundings on the player’s screen. The field workers are connected through their headsets to BP’s Houston offices, where experts can see and show staff how to perform repairs while they work. BP has started to collect many of these fixes in a video library so staff can call up videos, much like YouTube, to fix problems themselves without expert consultation. The company’s algorithms crunch data compiled from its wells each evening. Operators wake up each morning to a report telling them which wells may need repair, a task that once took hours each day as workers drove from well to well in search of problems. The systems, BP said, cut downtime for wells needing repairs by 50 percent, boosting production last year by 70 million cubic feet of natural gas across its shale portfolio. The technology provides a panoramic view into the ongoing needs of the oilfield, said Kimberly Krieger, who overseas BP’s shale operations in eastern Texas. “It’s like looking into a crystal ball,” Krieger said. The firm’s success in reducing costs reflects its ability to spend money automating its oil fields and overhaul work processes to drive down service and equipment costs. BP also separated its shale business from the main company to allow the business, now headquartered in Denver, to form its own culture. “We’re able to leverage the best parts of our global business to boost our shale operations,” Pugh said. “Our smaller shale rivals in the U.S. don’t necessarily have that.” Other majors are shooting for the same results. Exxon expects its shale operations to produce $5 billion in profit by 2022, compared to a $2 billion loss in 2016. Chevron expects 10 percent of its profit to come from the Permian by 2020 after it lost money there during the oil downturn of 2014 to 2016. Shell forecasts that shale operations will make money for the first time next year and cash flow will hit $1 billion by 2020. “We use our global size to our advantage when we negotiate with suppliers.” Greg Guidry, who recently retired as Shell’s shale boss, told Reuters in March. “Costs keep coming down.” Reporting by Ernest Scheyder and Ron Bousso

Japanese government bonds sold off before possible monetary policy tweaks. Disappointing updates from U.S. tech heavyweights soured the mood across stock markets, knocking European shares off their six-week highs at the open and dragging down by 0.11 percent a MSCI index that tracks shares in 47 countries. “Quarterly results continue to be more than good overall, but markets appear to be particularly sensitive to the sporadic negative updates, especially from tech stocks,” said Alessandro Balsotti,” strategist and fund manager at JCI Capital. The week features quarterly earnings from more than 140 S&P 500 companies, including Apple. It will be closely watched after disappointing results from Facebook and Twitter shook investor belief in tech resilience. JPMorgan reported relatively aggressive moves into “value” stocks - in particular banks - and away from shares leveraged to economic growth. “Tech really began cracking on Tuesday before the floodgates opened on Friday,” analysts at the U.S. bank wrote in a note. “The rotation will likely continue, benefiting value categories at the expense of momentum/tech as rates are biased higher,” they added. “Europe’s higher weighting to banks/resource will help it vs the U.S.” In Europe, 70 companies on the STOXX 600 are due to report their updates this week with figures from big banks, including BNP Paribas, Intesa Sanpaolo, Lloyds in the spotlight. Away from earnings, the top focus will be three central bank meetings. Bank of Japan and the Bank of England will be eyed for possible policy tweaks, while the U.S. Federal Reserve is unlikely to deliver surprises. The Fed meets on Tuesday and Wednesday and is expected to keep rates unchanged and reaffirm the outlook for further rate rises. The market is almost fully priced for a hike in September and leaning towards a further move before the end of the year. The BoJ meeting that ends on Tuesday will be closely watched amid speculation the central bank might tweak its massive asset-buying programme and take a step towards less monetary policy accommodation. As the market tried to test the central bank’s intention, Japanese government bond sagged, sending the benchmark 10-year yield to its highest level in almost a year and a half . That forced the BoJ to conduct a special bond-buying operation for two sessions in a row and to end up buying a record amount to stem rising bond yields. On currency markets, the chance of a BoJ shift has sent the yen higher in the last week or so, leaving the dollar around 111.05 yen from a peak of 113.18 earlier in the month. Against a basket of currencies the dollar was hovering at 94.606, having repeatedly failed to clear resistance around 95.652 this month. The euro edged up to $1.1664 against the dollar in early European trading, after the European Central Bank reaffirmed last week that rates would remain low through the summer. In Asia, eyes were on China’s yuan after it suffered the longest weekly losing streak since November 2015. It duly weakened further, slipping past 6.8400 per dollar for the first time since June last year. In commodity markets, oil prices rose but gains were limited as the fallout from trade tensions weighed on markets. U.S. crude added 69 cents to $69.19, while Brent rose 13 cents to $74.40 a barrel.

2018-07-30,"(Repeats with no changes to text) TOKYO, July 27 (Reuters) - Japan’s biggest electric utilities are firing up old fossil fuel power plants and ramping up others that are already operating, pushing to meet demand as power prices hit record highs amid a deadly heatwave. The deployment of older, dirtier stations that use commodities such as crude and fuel oil highlights the lingering effects of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, which has left most of the country’s reactors offline as operators upgrade them. Like many other regions of the world, Japan has been hit by record temperatures in a two-week heatwave, with more than 80 people dying and thousands rushed to emergency rooms. Surging appetite for power as households and businesses crank up their air conditioning has driven utilities to start up old fossil fuel plants that had been mothballed but kept on standby or to boost output at already-operational fossil units. Kansai Electric Power, which supplies Japan’s western industrialized heartland where the heatwave has been most persistent, has started up two old oil-fired units, with total capacity of 1.2 gigawatts (GW), a spokesman told Reuters. The nation’s second-biggest utility has also run one station fuelled by natural gas and another fired by oil at higher than planned output levels, he said, adding that Kansai had also received 1 GW of power from five other utilities. The sweltering weather has driven prices on the Japan Electric Power Exchange for the Kansai region to just above 100 yen ($0.90) yen per kilowatt hour this week, the highest on record. Meanwhile, Tokyo Electric Power the country’s biggest electricity provider and the operator of the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant, has run oil, coal and gas plants at rates higher than their typical maximum capacity, a spokesman told Reuters. He declined to say which plants were operating at these levels. Japan relied on nuclear power for nearly a third of its electricity supply before the Fukushima disaster, but now has just six out of 40 available nuclear reactors running. And the scorching conditions could be set to stay as July turns to August, typically the hottest month in Japan. Western Japan has a 50 percent chance of experiencing above-average temperatures over the month, the country’s weather bureau said this week. Chubu Electric Power, the country’s third-biggest utility, sees electricity demand in July and August potentially exceeding initial estimates, President Satoru Katsuno told reporters on July 20. “Our old thermal power plants are working hard. We must get our act together to keep them well maintained,” he said.

2018-07-30,"* Nikkei eases 0.4 pct in early trade, volumes light * Focus on Tuesday’s BoJ meeting amid talk of policy tweaks * Apple results loom as tech sector loses favour By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, July 30 (Reuters) - Asian share markets drifted lower on Monday while currencies kept to familiar ranges ahead of a busy week peppered with central bank meetings, corporate results and updates on U.S. inflation and payrolls. Technology and energy shares led Japan’s Nikkei down 0.4 percent in early trade, while tech also featured in South Korea’s 0.2 percent decline. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.03 percent. The week ahead features quarterly earnings from more than 140 S&P 500 companies, including Apple Inc. Disappointing results from Intel Corp and Twitter Inc soured the mood on the Nasdaq on Friday, though the S&P 500 <.SPX) and Dow still ended firmer for the week. Analysts at JPMorgan cited relatively aggressive moves into “value” stocks - in particular banks - and away from shares particularly leveraged to growth. “Tech really began cracking on Tuesday before the floodgates opened on Friday,” they wrote in a note. “The rotation will likely continue, benefiting value categories at the expense of momentum/tech as rates are biased higher,” they added. “Europe’s higher weighting to banks/resource will help it vs the U.S.” The U.S. Federal Reserve meets on Tuesday and Wednesday and is widely expected to stand pat while reaffirming the outlook for further gradual rate rises. The market is almost fully priced for a hike in September and leaning towards a further move before year-end. A policy meeting by the Bank of Japan on Tuesday has taken on greater importance amid talk it could tweak its massive asset-buying campaign. Elias Haddad, a senior currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, doubted the BoJ would move just yet, but felt it may abandon the negative interest rate applied to accounts held by financial institutions at the central bank. The BoJ could also modify its annual objective of accumulating 80 trillion yen ($720 billion) of Japanese government bonds, as well as potentially lifting its target yield for 10-year JGBs. Those yields recorded the highest close since January 2016 last week. “Any of these policy changes would be interpreted as a step towards less monetary policy accommodation, dragging USD/JPY lower,” Haddad said. Just the chance of such a shift has sent the yen higher in the last week or so, pulling the dollar down to around 110.96 yen from a peak of 113.18 earlier in the month. Against a basket of currencies the dollar was hovering at 94.680, having repeatedly failed to clear resistance around 95.652 this month. The euro has had problems of its own as the European Central Bank emphasised that rates would not be rising until the second half of next year. On Monday, the euro was flat at $1.1658 , corralled between support around $1.1570 and resistance at $1.1750. In Asia, eyes will be on China’s yuan after it suffered its longest weekly losing streak since November 2015. It hit a 13-month low at 6.8369 per dollar last week. In commodity markets, oil prices were supported by easing trade tensions and Saudi Arabia’s temporary shutdown of a key crude shipping lane. U.S. crude added 25 cents to $68.94 in early trade, while Brent rose 1 cent to $74.30 a barrel. Spot gold eased a touch to $1,222.52. ($1 = 110.9000 yen) Reporting by Wayne Cole

2018-07-30,"YAOUNDE, July 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - With a flash of green light, a robot sputters and whizzes across the room, obeying the remote control commands 15-year-old Xaviera Nguefo and her team send its way. It is a scene that would not look out of place in a futuristic sci-fi fantasy, but is instead playing out in Yaounde, the dusty capital of Cameroon with its potholed streets and frequent power outages. In a country where one in four girls do not even learn to read, Xaviera, one of about 20 young Cameroonians studying at the NextGen centre in Yaounde, is picking up the basics of artificial intelligence. “I love doing that because the physics that they teach us (at school) is all applied here,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “And it makes me a little bit smarter!” The centre is the brainchild of Janet Fofang, a pioneering scientist and teacher who aims to train the future tech innovators of her country - with a particular focus on its girls. It enables young Cameroonians to learn to write code, make robots and acquire advanced computer skills, and is one of a range of initiatives Fofang has set up, including a technological school for 800 pupils. “We’ve seen technology prove to every one of us that it’s a good method to move away from poverty. And we all know that in these parts, women always remain at the poverty line,” she said. Nearly one in three girls in Cameroon are married by 18, according to a 2016 study by United Nations children’s agency UNICEF, and this often means they drop out of full-time education early. In 2016, 95 percent of all children out of school were girls, and U.N. data for 2010 - the most up to date available - showed women and girls made up 60 percent of Cameroon’s illiterate population. Studies suggest educating girls has a broader societal benefit that goes well beyond the individual child. If all girls had a secondary education, child deaths would be cut in half, saving almost 3 million lives across the globe, according to research by the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO. Fofang says teaching girls about technology can help break the cycle of “poverty from generation to generation”, but says social attitudes, as well as a lack of opportunities, are still holding them back. “An overly ambitious girl in Cameroon is not a good one – if you’re too ambitious, society judges you,” she said. One woman who has not allowed society to hold her back is chemical engineer Persis Mbangsi, one of a tiny minority of Cameroonian women who have broken through the glass ceiling. She is the only woman among 500 male engineers at the aluminium plant in Cameroon where she works. Together with other female engineers, Mbangsi established a social media initiative entitled Hidden No More Cameroon to showcase the achievements of women in technology. It was inspired by the Hollywood film “Hidden Figures”, which tells the story of three African-American female mathematicians in the 1960s who defy the odds by going to work for NASA. “We have a cultural background that says that a woman sits in the kitchen,” said Mbangsi. “But imagine in a community one person saying ... ‘oh, I’ve seen her, she’s a petroleum engineer’.” Cameroon, a lower-middle income country wedged between Central and West Africa, has natural resources including oil and gas, timber and minerals, yet 40 percent of its 23.7 million people live below the poverty line. The country needs to increase productivity and unleash the potential of its private sector, the World Bank said in April. After she qualified as an electrical engineer, Fofang worked in one of Yaounde’s poorest schools, where most teachers lacked even basic computer skills. In 2009 she established her own school, the Tassah Academy, financing it herself with the help of her mother and sister. The school specialises in technology and 60 percent of its students are girls. Five years later, seeking to take technology to schoolgirls around the country, she launched a scheme to encourage other schools to set up clubs to get girls interested in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). In August, Xaviera and her team will travel to Mexico to take part in an international competition to devise robots that provide reliable energy power systems – a topic close to their hearts given the frequent power outages in Cameroon. “It’s really frustrating sometimes. Just as we’re talking there can be ... a blackout,” said Xaviera, who wants to keep working on the issue. In the meantime, robotics is helping her assert herself against the boys in the team and at school, who she says often think they know best. Xaviera recalled a recent case where she came up with the solution to a problem - forcing them to concede she was right. “And I was so happy!” she laughed. “My solution, it worked!” Reporting by Inna Lazareva, Editing by Claire Cozens.

2018-07-30,"(Repeats with no change to text) * Fields off Darwin hold 30 Tcf of natural gas * Enough space at Ichthys and Darwin LNG to add 5 trains * Study recommends 4 million tonnes/year expansion of Darwin LNG * But ConocoPhillips focused on backfill for Darwin LNG train By Sonali Paul and Osamu Tsukimori MELBOURNE/TOKYO, July 27 (Reuters) - Australia’s tropical city of Darwin wants to establish itself as a world-scale energy export hub, building on its closeness to demand centres in Asia and abundant nearby natural gas resources. With the imminent start-up of Inpex Corp’s $40 billion Ichthys liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, the capital of the Northern Territory will be home to two LNG exporting facilities, with a total capacity of 12.6 million tonnes a year, including ConocoPhillips’ Darwin LNG plant that opened in 2006. Darwin is poised to become the nucleus of the Northern Territory’s push to expand LNG exports by tapping 30 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas offshore northern Australia. Perched at the top of the continent in a region known for saltwater crocodiles, Darwin is closer to Jakarta than Sydney. The city will vie with projects from Alaska to Qatar that will beef up global LNG supply from 2022 onwards to meet growing demand in Asia, the world’s top consuming region. “We have the gas, location and proximity to markets — whether it’s China, India, Japan or Indonesia,” said Paul Tyrrell, chairman of the Northern Territory Gas Taskforce, appointed to lead the region’s gas push. Ichthys and Darwin LNG have the space to add five more LNG production units, know as trains, with a feasibility study at Darwin LNG suggesting another unit producing 4 million tonnes per year (tpy) of the fuel would be optimal. Darwin LNG’s expansion would build off existing facilities, an advantage over the $200 billion of projects built from scratch in Australia over the past decade, said Graeme Bethune, chief executive of advisory firm EnergyQuest. “There’s a reasonable chance an expansion decision could be made within the next five years,” Bethune said. A second train at Darwin LNG would raise the Northern Territory’s LNG output to nearly 17 million tpy, equivalent to Indonesia, the world’s fifth-biggest exporter, according to data from the International Gas Union (IGU). “We remain open to all options” for a potential expansion of Darwin LNG, a spokesman for ConocoPhillips Australia said, adding the company wanted to get the most out of the region’s reserves. But first Conoco wants to secure gas to keep the original train filled when supply from its current source, the Bayu Undan field in the Timor Sea north of Darwin, runs out in 2023. Conoco and its partners Santos and South Korea’s SK E&S have agreed to conduct preliminary design work to develop the Barossa field, 300 kilometres (188 miles) north of Darwin, to supply Darwin LNG. “Darwin excites the heck out of me,” said Santos Chief Executive Kevin Gallagher at an industry conference in May. Santos also has stakes in the Petrel Tern and Crown Lasseter fields that could also feed Darwin LNG. Other reserves offshore Darwin are Evans Shoal, operated by Italy’s Eni, Greater Sunrise, operated by Woodside Petroleum, Cash Maple, operated by Thailand’s PTTEP , and ConocoPhillips’ Poseidon. Inpex would only make a decision to expand exports after getting the initial Ichthys trains up and running after the project has missed several deadlines for first production. “We have to produce 8.9 million tonnes first and then examine whether there is demand. At this stage, there is no concrete plan,” Inpex Chief Executive Officer Takayuki Ueda told Reuters earlier this month. Still, Ueda said the infrastructure for an expansion is in place. “We can develop new gas fields nearby and send gas through the current pipeline,” he said. In addition to the offshore gas, the Northern Territory holds 200 Tcf of onshore shale gas resources that could fuel manufacturing around Darwin. The territory lifted a ban on fracking in April and is developing strict environmental rule before exploration starts. However, environmental groups, farmers and indigenous communities are concerned about damage to water supplies. “We don’t think the government here is up to the task of managing this high risk industry,” said Lauren Mellor, a spokeswoman for the Frack Free NT Alliance.

Petrobras expects to start pumping pre-salt oil from new platforms in the fourth quarter that would add to output from Latin America’s biggest producer and lift its exports. The new supply could enlarge Brazil’s market share in China as buyers there cut oil imports from the United States following Beijing’s announcement it would impose tariffs on U.S. crude in retaliation against similar moves by Washington. “Petrobras’ oil export curve is increasing and China is currently the company’s main market,” a Petrobras spokesman said in an e-mail. “With (Chinese) refineries’ growing interest in buying oil directly from producers ... Petrobras will grow its presence with these refiners.” Petrobras started production in April at its wholly-owned Buzios pre-salt field in the Santos basin from platform P-74, located about 200 km off the Rio de Janeiro coast in water depths of 2,000 metres, according to the company’s website. Two more platforms, P-75 and P-76, are to come online in the fourth quarter. Total Buzios output is expected to grow to 750,000 bpd by 2021, once an additional four platforms come online, the company said. Buzios crude has API gravity of 28.4 degrees and contains about 0.31 percent sulphur, similar in quality to Brazil’s Lula crude, one of the most popular oils in China, the company said. The new supply could help lift Petrobras’ crude oil exports, which dropped 53.8 percent in June from a year ago to 696,000 barrels per day (2.86 million tonnes) as the company hiked its refinery output. Petrobras’ overall production in June stood at 2.03 million bpd, down 1.5 percent from May. Brazil’s oil liquids output, including biofuels, is expected to rise by 200,000 bpd to 3.5 million bpd in 2019, after holding steady in 2018, according to consultancy Energy Aspects. China’s demand for low-sulphur crude, such as oil from Angola and Brazil, jumped over the past two years after its independent refiners, also known as teapots, were allowed to import crude. That has moved Brazil up two notches since 2017 to fifth on China’s supplier list, with 657,000 bpd in the first quarter this year, according to data from China customs. The teapots’ oil imports from Brazil more than doubled in the first half of 2018 to 350,000 bpd compared with the same period a year ago, according to Beijing consultancy SIA Energy. More than half of Brazil’s shipments to China went through ports in Shandong province, home to most of China’s independent refiners, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data. Petrobras also supplied the first crude cargo to Chinese chemical producer Hengli Group for the start-up of its new refinery in northeast China in the fourth quarter of this year. New Brazilian crude Mero was also delivered to Shandong in June. Petrobras has expanded its trading team in Singapore to step up marketing efforts in China, the two sources familiar with the matter said. The company has appointed a business development person from within the company and hired a crude trader from a Chinese refiner who will join in September, the sources said. “In order to improve market share in China, and considering the entry of the teapots in the international market, Petrobras considers that it is necessary to have a professional fluent in Mandarin for the specific development of this market,” the company said, without confirming the new hire. Asia’s largest refiner Sinopec bought a third of China’s Brazilian oil imports in the first half of 2018, up 13 percent from a year ago, SIA Energy analyst Seng Yick Tee said. “Sinopec and independents have the appetite for additional crude imports from Brazil, and the potential tariffs on U.S. crude is one of the reasons,” Tee said. Trade flow data on Eikon, however, shows Brazilian exports to Shandong look set to drop in the third quarter - before the additional Buzios platforms start up - as poor margins and tighter credit have forced teapots to cut runs. The tough environment is expected to push independents to seek more competitive oil supplies, Tee said. Other sellers of Brazilian crude include Royal Dutch Shell and Equinor. State-owned China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and CNOOC Ltd also have equity stakes in Brazilian oilfields. Reporting by Florence Tan in SINGAPORE and Alexandra Alper in
