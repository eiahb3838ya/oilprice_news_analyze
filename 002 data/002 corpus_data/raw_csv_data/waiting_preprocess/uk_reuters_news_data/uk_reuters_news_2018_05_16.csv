2018-05-16,"SOFIA/PARIS (Reuters) - French energy giant Total joined other European companies in signalling on Wednesday they could exit Iran, casting doubt on whether European leaders meeting to try to salvage the Iran nuclear deal can safeguard trade with Tehran. President Donald Trump’s withdrawal of the United States from the nuclear accord and his order that sanctions be reimposed on Tehran have left European allies scrambling to keep the deal alive and protect their Iranian trade. EU leaders gathered in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia on Wednesday for their first meeting on the matter since Trump quit the accord earlier this month. But U.S. clout in international trade and finance limits their scope for action. Total (TOTF.PA) said it might quit a multi-billion-dollar gas project if it could not secure a waiver from U.S. sanctions. Tehran had repeatedly hailed the project as a symbol of the nuclear accord’s success. Such a move would be a blow to President Hassan Rouhani, who had hoped the prestigious project could make other international businesses regain confidence in Iran and bring in investment.  “It’s a bad sign. The EU can’t compel or really protect the private sector,” Sanam Vakil, associate fellow at Chatham House, said of Total’s announcement. Trump’s decision to abandon the 2015 nuclear accord risks exposing European countries that have since invested in Iran to renewed U.S. sanctions, after “wind-down” periods of three to six months expire. Danish oil product shipping operator Maersk Tankers said it would wind down its customer agreements in Iran by November, while German insurer Allianz (ALVG.DE) said on Tuesday it was preparing to wind down Iran-related business. The 28 EU leaders meeting in Sofia did not make any quick decisions on how to try to shield their economic cooperation with Iran. European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker presented options to protect European investment, which include retaliatory sanctions, allowing the European Investment Bank to invest in Iran, and coordinating euro-denominated credit lines from European governments. But the reach of the U.S. financial system, the dominance of the dollar and the presence of European companies’ operations in the United States all weaken any potential EU measures. Iran has said it may start enriching uranium again if it can no longer see any economic benefit from sticking to the deal, which lifted earlier international sanctions on the Islamic Republic in exchange for it curbing its nuclear ambitions. British, French and German foreign ministers vowed to try to keep Iran’s oil and investment flowing after a meeting with their Iranian counterpart on Tuesday but admitted they would struggle to provide the guarantees Tehran seeks. They tasked experts with coming up with measures for a meeting of their deputies in Vienna next week. The EU’s top energy official, Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete, is meanwhile heading to Iran on May 18-21 for talks on energy cooperation, a symbolic gesture from the EU that it wants to stay engaged despite the U.S. withdrawal. Total said it would wind down operations linked to the South Pars gas venture before Nov. 4 unless it were granted a specific project waiver by the U.S. authorities, with the support of the French and European authorities. The French firm signed a deal with Tehran in July 2017 to develop phase 11 of Iran’s South Pars field, marking the first major Western energy investment in the long isolated country since the lifting of sanctions.  Underlining the depth of trans-Atlantic discord, the chairman of EU leaders Donald Tusk said Trump had “rid Europe of all illusions” by withdrawing from the Iran accord and driving trade disputes. “Looking at the latest decisions of President Trump, someone could even think: With friends like that, who needs enemies?” Tusk told a news conference. Repudiating the result of more than a decade of diplomacy, Trump quit the accord last week, complaining that the deal does not cover Iran’s ballistic missiles, its role in regional wars or what happens after the pact begins to expire in 2025. Major European countries share Trump’s concerns, and the EU leaders on Wednesday agreed to seek ways to address them. But they argue that the nuclear deal is the way to stop the increasingly influential regional power from obtaining an atomic weapon. German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted the pact also helped with concerns about Tehran’s role in Middle East conflicts.  “The question is whether you can talk better if you terminate an agreement or if you stay in it ... we say you can talk better if you remain in it,” she told the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament.. In Moscow, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia supported an EU proposal to hold a meeting on the Iran deal in Vienna, Interfax news agency said. The meeting is due on May 25. The United States imposed sanctions on Tuesday on Iran’s central bank governor, three other individuals, and an Iraqi-based bank as Washington seeks to cut off funding it says Tehran is using to fund militant activities overseas. Iran said the new U.S. sanctions were an attempt to derail efforts to save the nuclear deal. Rouhani said Trump had expected Iran to leave the deal after the U.S. withdrawal, but Tehran had refused to follow that plan by trying to save the deal with its remaining signatories. “Trump played his first card, but miscalculated the second move,” Rouhani was quoted as saying by the ISNA agency.

2018-05-16,"(Adds details on LNG Canada project, construction contractors, price update) By Julie Gordon VANCOUVER, May 16 (Reuters) - Construction on TransCanada Corp’s C$4.8 billion ($3.8 billion) Coastal GasLink pipeline will start in early 2019, pending a positive final investment decision on the linked LNG Canada project, the head of the pipeline project said on Wednesday. The comments followed a commitment from the chief executive of LNG Canada on Tuesday that the C$40 billion liquefied natural gas export terminal would be under construction in 2018. A final investment decision, or FID, from the project partners is expected this year. “We would be looking at constructing in the early part of 2019,” Coastal Gaslink President Richard Gateman told reporters at an LNG conference. “We could be doing a little bit of field work in the fall (of 2018), if there’s an FID decision.” TransCanada’s 670-km (415-mile) Coastal GasLink pipeline will cross two mountain ranges to connect rich shale fields in Alberta and northeast British Columbia with the proposed LNG Canada export terminal on British Columbia’s northwest coast. If the project goes ahead, it will be a game changer for Canada’s natural gas producers, which currently face steep discounts for their product because of sagging demand in the United States and a lack of other export markets. TransCanada expects to award contracts for the construction to four consortiums within the next two months, Gateman said. Those contractors will be a mix of local and international players with experience building in mountainous terrain, he said. The company also expects to provide a cost update around the same time, he said, adding: “I’ll say that that was an estimate in 2011 dollars and if you take that to 2018 dollars, it’s a little bit more, but it’s not substantially more.” The C$4.8 billion price tag in 2011 dollars would equate to C$5.3 billion now, according to the Bank of Canada inflation calculator. Bateman also said TransCanada had worked hard to keep costs down on the project, just as the LNG Canada partners have worked to bring down costs on the terminal project. “We contributed our part in terms of the pipeline budget and they did their part on the facility, which is why it looks like it is successfully coming together,” he said. LNG Canada is a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell Plc , PetroChina Co Ltd, Mitsubishi Corp and Korea Gas Corp. TransCanada will own and operate the pipeline. $1 = 1.2785 Canadian dollars

2018-05-16,"SOFIA (Reuters) - European Union leaders agreed on Wednesday to try to keep the Iran nuclear deal alive and maintain their reviving economic cooperation with Tehran after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the pact.  But the 28 EU leaders did not make any quick decisions during their first meeting on the matter since Trump quit the accord earlier this month, highlighting how U.S. clout in international trade and finance limits the Europeans’ scope for action. That was quickly brought home by the French energy giant Total which joined other European companies in signaling on Wednesday they could exit Iran. “As long as Iran respects the provisions of the deal, the EU will also respect it,” said Donald Tusk, president of the European Council and chairman of the leaders’ gathering in the Bulgarian capital Sofia. The leaders of Britain, France and Germany briefed their peers. The three countries were EU signatories of the 2015 deal that gave Iran sanctions relief in exchange for curbing its nuclear program but which Trump dismissed as “the worst deal ever.”  The head of the bloc’s executive, Jean-Claude Juncker of the European Commission, has also presented options the leaders have to shield European investments in Iran and the slowly reviving economic cooperation, which many EU states hope to benefit from. An EU source said after the talks the leaders agreed to start “work to protect European companies negatively affected by the U.S. decision.”   Options include allowing the European Investment Bank to invest there and coordinating euro-denominated credit lines from EU states. Foreign ministers of Germany, France and Britain met their Iranian counterpart in Brussels on Tuesday and tasked their experts to come up with measures for a meeting of their deputies in Vienna next week. But a senior EU official admitted there was no silver-bullet solution and that it would “take some time” for the bloc to come up with what would be a complex mix of national and joint steps. The EU’s top energy and climate official, Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete, is heading to Iran on May 18-21 for talks on energy cooperation, a symbolic gesture from the EU that it wants to stay engaged despite the U.S. withdrawal.  In his criticism of the accord, which the other signatories Russia and China also want to uphold, Trump has said it did not go far enough in restraining Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons, while not addressing its missile program and involvement in various conflicts in the Middle East.  EU leaders agreed on Wednesday to keep on looking into these issues, but their previous efforts have not convinced Trump.  As the EU scrambles to salvage an accord they see as a key element of international security and a diplomatic success, they also wonder about their ties with Washington.  Tusk’s unusually biting criticism of Trump on Wednesday highlighted the deep trans-Atlantic split: “Looking at the latest decisions of President Trump, someone could even think: With friends like that, who needs enemies?”       Reporting by Gabriela Baczynska, Editing by William Maclean and Cynthia Osterman",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-europe/update-1-eu-leaders-struggle-to-save-iran-economic-ties-from-us-sanctions-idUKL5N1SN7MN,16 May 2018,"* Firms mull Iran exit as EU heads discuss how to keep them

2018-05-16,"LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - OPEC sees oil’s rally towards $80 a barrel as a short-term spike driven by geopolitics rather than any supply shortage, four OPEC delegates said, a sign the group is not rushing yet to rethink its supply-cutting agreement. The view of top exporter Saudi Arabia is that any brief, speculator-driven jump in oil prices is not sufficient grounds for producers to boost output, an OPEC source familiar with the kingdom’s thinking said.  For such a decision to occur, the rally would need to be driven by data pointing to a supply impact, the source said. The four OPEC delegates said the latest rise in prices stemmed more from concern about U.S. sanctions on Iran and tension in the Middle East, rather than a suddenly tighter balance between oil supply and demand. “Prices are high just because of the tensions,” one of the OPEC delegates, who declined to be identified, said. Since last year, oil has been supported by a deal by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, plus Russia and other non-members, to cut output. Prices have risen about 40 percent since the accord began in January 2017. Global benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 on Tuesday hit $79.47, the highest since November 2014, before easing below $78 on Wednesday and settling at $79.28 a barrel.  Prices could rally further before declining, according to some in OPEC. “It may exceed $80 and then go down,” one of the sources said. In any case, the extent of the rally has yet to cause any real concern. “Not yet,” said another delegate, asked whether oil at $79 was too high. U.S. President Donald Trump last month accused OPEC of “artificially” boosting prices, putting pressure on producers to cool the market and in turn drawing a rebuke from some OPEC members. OPEC and its allies are cutting production by about 1.8 million barrels per day, almost 2 percent of world supply, until the end of 2018. Oil ministers meet on June 22-23 to review the policy. The producers’ original goal was to reduce oil inventories to the five-year average. While this has largely been achieved, ministers have said other metrics should be considered such as oil industry investment, suggesting they are in no hurry yet to wind down supply cuts. Nonetheless, delegates pointed to growing concern about a decline in Venezuelan output due to economic crisis, which officials had downplayed when inventories were higher.  OPEC has over-delivered on the supply cut due in part to lower Venezuelan supply. OPEC has no official target price for oil. Saudi Arabia has emerged over the past year as OPEC’s leading supporter of measures to boost prices, however, a change from Riyadh’s previous, more moderate stance.  The kingdom, keen to fund economic reforms, would be happy to see crude rise to $80 or even $100, industry sources told Reuters last month. Iran, once a keen OPEC price hawk, now wants lower prices than Saudi Arabia, and has said exporters should aim for crude around $60 to contain U.S. shale oil growth.  “When oil prices rise due to geopolitical concern and not due to demand and supply and fundamentals, it cannot be reasonable,” a source familiar with Iranian thinking said of the current rally.

2018-05-16,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rallied further to a five-month high on Wednesday, supported by relatively robust U.S. economic data in recent days, while Italy’s borrowing costs jumped and its stocks slid on concerns linked to economic plans from the country’s potential coalition government. Wall Street’s main stock indexes gained, with the Russell 2000 small-cap benchmark marking a record high. Investors were digesting Tuesday’s surge in U.S. bond yields on the heels of a retail sales report that fuelled the dollar and hurt stocks. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield held well above 3 percent after bursting through key technical levels on Tuesday. Data on Wednesday showed U.S. industrial production increased solidly in April, the latest indication that the economy was gathering momentum early in the second quarter. “There is a lot of talk about the risks of interest rates and that’s real. But then there’s the question of why rates are rising and that’s faster growth,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network in Waltham, Massachusetts. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 62.52 points, or 0.25 percent, to 24,768.93, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 11.01 points, or 0.41 percent, to 2,722.46 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 46.67 points, or 0.63 percent, to 7,398.30. Shares of U.S. retailers .SPXRT rose 0.5 percent after results from department store chain Macy’s (M.N), whose shares jumped 10.8 percent. The Russell 2000  rose 1.0 percent and set its first record high since late January. “For small caps, they are not exposed to a lot of the risks that larger caps are facing,” McMillan said. Italy’s two anti-system parties appeared on the verge of clinching a deal to form a coalition government, rattling markets with radical ideas to free up billions of euros for tax cuts and welfare. Investors seized on a report that the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the far-right League party plan to ask the European Central Bank to forgive 250 billion euros (£218.8 billion) of Italian debt, according to a draft the parties are working on. Italian stocks .FTMIB tumbled 2.3 percent while Italy's 10-year bond yield jumped nearly 19 basis points to 2.13 percent IT10YT=RR.  “It’s right to resonate with markets because it tells you about the sense of the wisdom between these negotiating parties,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets. Other major European stock markets were higher, and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.19 percent, supported by the weaker euro. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.17 percent. North Korea threw next month’s summit between Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump into doubt by saying it may reconsider if Washington insists it unilaterally gives up its nuclear weapons. “Investors have gotten sort of used to this. Whether we are talking about North Korea or the trade discussions with China ... I think investors are recognising we are at the beginning of the beginning of this, so it’s not anything to make dramatic portfolio moves or any significant bets on,” said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for the wealth management division of Northern Trust in Chicago. U.S. Treasury yields ended slightly higher, with the 10-year yield touching near a seven-year high. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 6/32 in price to yield 3.1001 percent, from 3.08 percent late on Tuesday. The dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, rose 0.16 percent to 93.365 after rising to 93.632 during the session, its highest since mid-December. The euro EUR= was down 0.26 percent to $1.1806. Oil prices gained after an inventory report showed U.S. crude and gasoline stocks fell more than expected. U.S. crude CLcv1 settled up 0.25 percent at $71.49 a barrel, while benchmark Brent LCOcv1 settled at $79.28, up 1.08 percent.

2018-05-16,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices gained on Wednesday, shaking off the effects of a strengthening dollar, after an inventory report showed U.S. crude and gasoline stocks fell more than expected.  Brent crude futures LCOc1 gained 85 cents to settle at $79.28 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures gained 18 cents to settle at $71.49 a barrel. “We rallied as the day went on,” said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition in Stamford. “We continued to receive support from concerns about supply from the Iranian nuclear accord, Venezuela ... as well as the draw in crude,” McGillian said.  U.S. crude inventories USOILC=ECI fell by 1.4 million barrels in the week to May 11, compared with analyst expectations for a 763,000 barrel decrease. [EIA/S] U.S. gasoline stocks fell 3.79 million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s weekly report. Analysts had expected a 1.42 million barrel decline. That helped push gasoline futures RBc1 to their highest levels since October 2014.  “The strength of gasoline, which made new highs, a 3-1/2-year high today ... helped pull up crude later in the session,” said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates in Galena, Illinois. Exports hit a new one-week record, the EIA said. The report pointed to healthy demand for U.S. crude, Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said. In Venezuela, production plunged to 1.5 million barrels last month, its lowest level in decades due to its ongoing economic crisis.  Meanwhile, the dollar .DXY firmed to nearly a five-month high against a basket of other major currencies on Wednesday. A stronger greenback makes it more expensive to buy dollar-denominated commodities such as oil. While futures prices climb, physical crude markets are sagging under the weight of unsold barrels. The 50 percent rise in oil prices in the last year is encouraging major companies such as ExxonMobil (XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Chevron (CVX.N), BP (BP.L) and Total (TOTF.PA) to increase output. Spot crude oil cargo prices are at their steepest discounts to futures prices in years as sellers struggle to find buyers for West African, Russian and Kazakh cargoes, while pipeline bottlenecks trap supply in West Texas and Canada.   The International Energy Agency warned global demand is likely to moderate this year as crude prices near $80 a barrel and many key importing countries no longer offer consumers generous fuel subsidies. In its monthly report, the Paris-based IEA cut its forecast for 2018 global demand growth to 1.4 million barrels per day, from 1.5 million bpd. [IEA/M] “On balance, the report is tending more to the negative side. Demand for oil has been revised downwards for the second half of the year from April,” PVM Oil Associates strategist Tamas Varga said.

2018-05-16,"WASHINGTON, May 16 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s nominee for the top U.S. State Department job dealing with matters related to energy and the global oil industry was approved by a Senate committee on Wednesday, as the United States gears up to re-impose sanctions on Iran’s oil exports. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved Francis Fannon, a former head of corporate affairs at mining company BHP Billiton  and senior director of Murphy Oil Corp , to head the department’s energy bureau. If Fannon is confirmed in a vote by the full Senate, one of his most immediate tasks as assistant secretary of state would be synthesizing reports from intelligence agencies with oil industry data to re-implement sanctions on Iran’s oil exports. Trump announced on May 8 he was withdrawing the United States from the 2015 Iran deal, which removed sanctions in exchange for the Islamic Republic curbing its nuclear program. Fannon was approved by 19 of the 21 members of the panel with two Democratic senators opposing him. One of the Democrats, Senator Bob Menendez, said Fannon had lobbied against comprehensive climate change legislation and against limits on drilling in the Gulf of Mexico put in place after BP’s 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, that killed 11 platform workers. “Energy security rests in energy diversification, innovation, and development of zero and low carbon energy sources,” Menendez said at the hearing. “The appointment of an oil and gas lobbyist to this position demonstrates a backwards outlook on energy policy.” Before working in corporations, Fannon served as counsel to the Senate environment committee and as an aide to two Republican senators. In a hearing before the panel’s vote, Fannon said that he had drafted provisions of the 2005 energy bill that helped unleash innovation and set the conditions for U.S. energy abundance today.

2018-05-16,"LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal’s Environmental Agency gave its tacit approval on Wednesday to a consortium of Galp Energia and Italy’s ENI to drill an oil exploration well off the Alentejo region’s coast, a project that environmental activists are trying to block. It would mark the resumption of drilling in Portugal after a long hiatus, with opponents arguing the risks outweigh the chances of finding any significant quantities of oil. The agency said it had not identified any potentially significant negative effects on the environment from the planned deep-sea well, and would not order a specific study, which opponents of the project have been demanding.  Various local municipalities, politicians and activists have filed lawsuits and petitions to try and block oil exploration off the so-called Vicentine coast in Alentejo, which boasts beautiful beaches and a large natural park.  Several oil companies spudded a few dozen exploration wells in Portugal in the 20th century, but all were either dry or showed just traces of hydrocarbons. Drilling activity petered out in the early 2000s, although seismic studies have continued. Portugal’s Galp and its partner at the time, Brazil’s Petrobras, won an exploration licence in 2007 for three blocks in the Alentejo basin. ENI bought Petrobras’ share in the blocks in 2014. The consortium hopes to drill the well in the last quarter of 2018 after the government last January extended the exploration period for a year. The Expresso newspaper said last month an internal study by the consortium pointed to potential oil reserves of up to 1.5 billion barrels in the area, but the companies would not publicly confirm such estimates, saying only they expected to find hydrocarbons based on seismic studies. Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe last month named Portugal the winner of its 2018 European Fossil Fuel Subsidies anti-award for handing out the drilling licence near its protected biodiversity area and a tourism hotspot and wasting taxpayers’ money on supporting dirty energy.

2018-05-16,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada is prepared to cover some losses Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd might suffer if a proposed oil pipeline expansion is delayed and thinks other investors are ready to step in if need be, Finance Minister Bill Morneau said on Wednesday. The company has given Ottawa a deadline of May 31 to provide assurances it can proceed with a plan to more than double the capacity of its Trans Mountain line from Alberta to British Columbia. The government of the Pacific coast province opposes the project on environmental grounds. “We are willing to indemnify the Trans Mountain expansion against unnecessary delays that are politically motivated,” Morneau told reporters on the same day that Kinder Morgan Canada is holding its annual general meeting. The issue could become one of the biggest crises facing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose Liberal government approved the expansion. Trudeau says Canadian oil producers are losing C$15 billion ($11.7 billion) a year because pipeline bottlenecks mean they cannot get their crude to export markets. Morneau said if Kinder Morgan decided to walk away from the project, the indemnification would stay in place in case someone else took over. Whether the company would allow a rival to take charge of the expansion is unclear. “If Kinder Morgan is not interested in building the project we think plenty of investors would be interested ... especially knowing that the federal government believes it is in the best interest of Canadians,” Morneau said. Despite the legal and political challenges, it is likely investors would consider a commercially sound project with Ottawa behind it, said Andrew Leach, associate professor of business economics at the University of Alberta. “It’s an attractive midstream energy project and there are lots of players in Canada and internationally that would look at that type of a project,” he said. Morneau declined to say what aid Ottawa could provide or how much. Sources have previously said Ottawa is examining options such as loan guarantees, a bailout, or taking a stake in the C$7.4 billion project. Shares in Kinder Morgan Canada rose 2.8 percent on the Toronto Stock exchange. Morneau blamed British Columbia premier John Horgan for delaying the project while making clear Ottawa would not cover losses caused by environmental and aboriginal opponents. “That specific risk (Horgan’s opposition) is a risk that for a private sector player is impossible to deal with. They can’t negotiate between governments,” said Morneau. “We see that as something we can actually indemnify.

2018-05-16,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran signed a preliminary deal on Wednesday for a consortium of international companies to develop an oilfield, the first such contract since Washington withdrew from a nuclear agreement and said it would reinstate sanctions on Tehran. National Iranian South Oil Company (NISOC) signed a so-called heads of agreement (HOA) with London-based Pergas, the oil ministry’s news agency SHANA said.  The consortium will aim to produce 655 million barrels of oil from the Keranj field in Khuzestan province, southwest Iran, over the next 10 years, SHANA said. British Ambassador to Tehran Rob Macaire and Pergas managing director Colin Rowley were present at the signing ceremony in Tehran, it added. “We hope that the UK government ... endorses the agreement,” Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh was quoted as saying by SHANA. Zanganeh added that he expected European countries to make up for the U.S. “betrayal” of the nuclear deal, and support Western companies that sign deals with Tehran. The agreement was announced on the same day that French energy group Total (TOTF.PA) said it would pull out of a multibillion-dollar gas project in Iran if it couldn’t secure a waiver from U.S. sanctions. Zanganeh said Tehran would spare no efforts to maintain its oil production and exports at current levels, and predicted it would overcome the difficulties resulting from the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal. “The current situation will pass and Iran will emerge as a winner,” he was quoted as saying. “Iran is a peace-seeking nation, and honors its contracts,” he added. Zanganeh also said oil prices at $60-$65 per barrel would be “logical” and that he believed the United States was trying to keep prices inflated to support U.S. shale oil growth. “Despite what Americans say that they do not support high oil prices, the high prices of oil can justify shale production, increase investment and create more jobs in the United States,” Bijan Zanganeh was quoted as saying by Mehr news agency.

2018-05-16,"PARIS (Reuters) - Total (TOTF.PA) will pull out of a multibillion-dollar gas project in Iran if it cannot secure a waiver from U.S. sanctions, the French energy company said on Wednesday. Companies are starting to take matters into their own hands as European and some other governments struggle to save an international nuclear deal with Iran after the United States withdrew and said it would reinstate sanctions on Tehran.  Determined to keep the accord alive, European leaders need to find a way to assure companies that their investments are beyond Washington’s extra-territorial reach.  They also want to persuade Tehran the 2015 deal - which lifted earlier sanctions on the Islamic Republic in exchange for it curbing its nuclear ambitions - is worth sticking to. Total signed a contract in 2017 to develop phase 11 of Iran’s South Pars field with an initial investment of $1 billion (£741 million) - a contract Tehran repeatedly hailed as a symbol of the accord’s success.   “Total will not continue the SP11 (South Pars 11) project and will have to unwind all related operations before 4 November 2018, unless Total is granted a specific project waiver by U.S. authorities with the support of the French and European authorities,” the French oil and gas major said in a statement. Total’s announcement comes after German insurer Allianz (ALVG.DE) and Danish oil product tanker operator Maersk Tankers said they were winding down their businesses in Iran. Joe Kaeser, the CEO of Germany’s Siemens (SIEGn.DE), told CNN his company would not be able to do any new business with Tehran. Iran has said it may start enriching uranium again if it can no longer see any economic benefit to the deal. Total said any waiver would need to include protection from secondary sanctions that Washington might impose on companies that continue to do business with Iran.  These might include the loss of financing in dollars by U.S. banks, the loss of U.S. shareholders and the inability to continue its U.S. operations, it said. France, Germany and Britain are leading a European effort to safeguard Europe’s economic interests but have few options that pose any threat to the United States.  “It would be suicide to do any new business or funding for Iran or Iran-related companies without explicit guarantees from the U.S. government. They have us by the throat because so much business is conducted and cleared in dollars,” one European investment banker said.  “The fines are in the multibillions these days so it’s just not worth the risk for a small piece of business and maybe pleasing a (European) government.” An official in the French finance ministry said “precise requests” were being lodged with the U.S. authorities, including for Total, and that the company’s decision was not a surprise. A European diplomat was more blunt: “We have a situation where there is a will to impose sanctions on Europeans and a resentment towards European companies who are now being accused of supporting a terrorist state. With that in mind it’s a logical decision.”  Total said it had so far spent less than 40 million euros (£35 million) on the project and withdrawing would not impact the company’s production growth targets. Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said the French firm would not pay a penalty if it pulled out of the project. Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI), which last June signed a provisional agreement with Tehran to conduct oil and gas feasibility studies, said after Washington’s decision to quit the nuclear deal last week that it had no plans for new projects in Iran.  In an unintended twist, U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to threaten European companies that continue to invest in Iran may open the door to Chinese rivals. Industry sources told Reuters this week that China’s CNPC, which holds a 30 percent stake in the South Pars project, was ready to take over Total’s majority stake in the project if it pulled out.

2018-05-16,"(Adds details on traffic measures, political EPA tweet, and background on pressure from Republican senator concerned about ethanol) By Valerie Volcovici and Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON, May 16 (Reuters) - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt said on Wednesday that he now has a legal fund in place to help him fight off a growing list of allegations against him related to his spending and reported ethical missteps in office. “It has been set up,” Pruitt told the Senate Appropriations Committee’s subcommittee on Interior, Environment and Related Agencies about the fund. He was speaking during a hearing that was meant to focus on the EPA’s 2019 budget but that centered on questions about his conduct - including an allegation he had sought to be transported through traffic with flashing lights and sirens. Pruitt has been under pressure from lawmakers in recent weeks over reports about his routine use of first-class travel, his 24/7 security detail, costly office renovations, and ties to industry - criticisms he called overblown on Wednesday. He is still supported by President Donald Trump and most Republicans lawmakers, who have welcomed his efforts to roll back Obama-era environmental regulations that are seen by industry as overly burdensome. At Wednesday’s hearing with the 13-member panel, Democratic senators lambasted his record at the agency. Patrick Leahy of Vermont called his regulatory rollbacks and ethical controversies “unconscionable,” and Tom Udall of New Mexico said his tenure at the EPA was “a betrayal of the American people.” Most of the committee’s six Democratic members have vehemently opposed Pruitt’s efforts to roll back climate and pollution regulations introduced under Democratic former President Barack Obama, and have seized on the controversies around Pruitt’s conduct to call for his resignation. Udall pressed Pruitt on reports that he had pushed his security agents to use flashing lights and sirens on agency vehicles on trips that were not emergencies. “No, I don’t recall that,” said Pruitt, when asked if he had personally requested the use of lights and sirens. Udall submitted for the record on an email released on Wednesday by Pruitt’s former security chief Nino Perrotta, who left the agency weeks ago. Udall said Perrotta wrote in the email that Pruitt had encouraged the use of the devices. The controversies around Pruitt have triggered some 12 investigations by the EPA’s inspector general, congressional committees and the White House. A Government Accountability Office probe concluded last month that the EPA had violated the law by spending $43,000 on a soundproof phone booth for Pruitt’s office without first notifying lawmakers. Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski – chair of the Appropriations subcommittee – said in her opening remarks that she welcomed some of Pruitt’s regulatory agenda but the ethics issues were a distraction. “Unfortunately, I am concerned that many of the important policy efforts you are engaged in are being overshadowed,” she said. “There are some legitimate questions that need to be answered,” she said. Pruitt told the panel that he understood the concerns, but added that “some of the criticism is unfounded and exaggerated.” Pruitt has also faced growing pressure from some Republican senators who are not on the panel over his handling of U.S. biofuels policy. Senator Chuck Grassley, for example, said on Tuesday he would join lawmakers calling for Pruitt’s ouster unless the EPA chief curbs the agency’s use of waivers exempting refineries from their obligation to mix ethanol into fuel. The EPA has the authority to exempt small refineries if they can prove that complying would cause them economic hardship, but biofuels advocates, often from corn-growing states such as Grassley’s Iowa, say overusing the waivers kills demand for ethanol. Pruitt was also criticized for a tweet on April 13 by the EPA’s official account that cheered Senate approval of former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler as deputy administrator of the EPA and stated that “the Democrats couldn’t block the confirmation.” Udall said he had asked the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office to investigate the EPA’s use of social media to send a politically driven Tweet. Under the Hatch Act, federal employees are banned from taking part in political activities. Pruitt said the agency made a mistake. “I was unaware of the tweet and that shouldn’t have occurred. There shouldn’t have been mocking,” he said. Some changes have been implemented at the EPA since some of the scandals broke, including the addition of a requirement that any spending over $5,000 needs to be signed off by several senior officials, Pruitt told the panel. Pruitt has also said that he has stopped routinely flying first class, something the agency had previously defended as a way to help him avoid threats from the public. On the legal defense fund, Pruitt said his attorney was working with the Government Accountability Office to make sure it was run properly. All donations to the fund would be published and available to the public, he said, and he committed “absolutely” not to accept any donations from lobbyists or companies that have business before the EPA. When asked if he would commit to not accepting anonymous donations for the fund, Pruitt said his lawyers handle them and would follow official guidelines.

2018-05-16,"* Nigeria is Africa’s biggest crude oil producer * Budget was first presented by Buhari in Nov. * Spending plan must be signed into law by Buhari * Nigeria to hold presidential election in Feb. 2019 (Adds quotes, lower house passing) By Camillus Eboh ABUJA, May 16 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s parliament passed a record 9.12 trillion naira ($29.8 billion) budget for 2018 on Wednesday aimed at boosting growth in west Africa’s biggest economy nine months before the country’s next presidential election. Growth remains fragile after Africa’s top crude oil producer last year emerged from its first recession in 25 years. The recession was largely caused by low crude prices and militant attacks on energy facilities since oil sales make up two-thirds of government revenue. The total sum laid out in the spending plan passed by the Senate is higher than the 8.6 trillion naira budget presented to parliament by President Muhammadu Buhari in November. The budget was passed by the Senate, the upper chamber, and by lawmakers in the lower House of Representatives shortly afterwards. The budget still needs to be returned to Buhari to be signed into law. “We must grow our economy away from oil. Hopefully, the current budget, when signed into law, should help us in this regard,” said Senate President Bukola Saraki. Senate lawmakers said the increase from the plan presented by Buhari six months ago was due to the assumed oil price rising to $51 per barrel, up from $45 in Buhari’s earlier version. The budget assumes crude oil production of 2.3 million barrels per day and an exchange rate of 305 naira per dollar. Brent crude stood at $78.43 per barrel by 1643 GMT. “We still consider the oil price benchmark to be rather conservative given this year’s oil price outlook and would have preferred to see a steeper hike accompanied by lower borrowing,” said Olalekan Olabode, an economist at Lagos investment firm Vetiva Capital. The budget proposes the use of 2.2 trillion naira to service debts and would operate a deficit of 1.73 percent of gross domestic product this year. Delays in passing budgets, amid wrangling between the executive and legislature, are common in Nigeria and hindered the implementation of Buhari’s previous spending plans. Buhari, who took office in 2015, plans to seek a second term in next February’s election. His handling the economy is likely to be a major campaign issue. Budgets under Buhari, who took office in May 2015, have been Nigeria’s largest ever. But economists say implementation has been poor and failed to provide the type of capital expenditure needed to improve infrastructure. “The implementation of fiscal policy is still weak and this year there is an additional risk of unproductive spending in the lead up to the election,” said Cobus de Hart, a senior economist at South Africa’s NKC African Economics.

2018-05-16,"(Reuters) - Brent crude prices will sustain levels above $70 a barrel for longer, as U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran is likely to tighten supply, a Reuters poll of analysts showed on Wednesday.     A survey of 11 analysts showed Brent crude LCOc1 prices were likely to average $71.22 a barrel this year and $71.26 in 2019, a sharp increase from the $67.40 and $66.39-per-barrel levels forecast in the April poll. Brent has averaged about $69 a barrel this year thus far and nearly touched $80 a barrel this week.  “Oil markets should become tighter due to a lower output from Iran, coupled with an ongoing contraction in Venezuelan output and OPEC cuts,” said Daniela Corsini, commodity market economist at Intesa Sanpaolo in Milan.  U.S. light crude CLc1 was seen averaging $66.62 a barrel this year and $67.09 a barrel in 2019. This compares with an outlook for $63.23 per barrel in 2018 and $62.16 in 2019 in our April poll.      Last week, Trump pulled the United States out of a 2015 international nuclear pact with Iran, and plans to reimpose U.S. economic sanctions on the country. That has cast uncertainty over global oil supplies, and investors lately have been betting on prices exceeding $80 or $90 a barrel, though European nations are not likely to follow suit as they did during the Obama administration. Five of the 11 analysts polled expected a supply reduction from Iran of between 300,000 to 500,000 barrels per day (bpd), while exports from the country were expected to drop by a maximum of 700,000 bpd by the first half of 2019. The nation currently produces 3.8 million bpd. Oil prices are hovering near 3-1/2-year highs, having jumped over 70 percent over the last year, boosted by rising demand and a deal to curb output by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia and other producers, including Russia. The International Energy Agency on Wednesday warned that demand could be sapped by higher-than-expected prices. [O/R]  “Global oil inventories are already either below or at the five-year average. This means that the market will have little cushion against any other unexpected production outage at a time when geopolitical risks abound. These risks can come from Libya, Nigeria and Venezuela,” said Shakil Begg, head of Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts.  A global oil glut has been virtually eliminated, figures published by OPEC showed on Monday, with Venezuela, whose output has plunged due to an economic crisis, reporting production fell to 1.5 million bpd in April, lowest in decades.  A majority of analysts said OPEC was unlikely to prematurely end its output curbs, while some analysts said the imposition of trade restrictions could affect compliance levels and provide countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia an opportunity to regain market share.  Commerzbank and Emirates NBD had the lowest 2018 Brent price forecast at $69 a barrel, while Nomisma Energia had the highest forecast for the year at $75.41.

2018-05-16,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - U.S. agribusiness group Bunge (BG.N) said on Wednesday it was reducing biodiesel output at a German refinery, the latest in a series of production cuts in Germany following a surge of cheap imports of the green fuel into Europe. Bunge expects to initially cut output at its Mannheim biodiesel plant by 50 percent in the second quarter of 2018, a Bunge spokeswoman said. The plant has capacity to produce 120,000 tonnes of biodiesel annually. “Afterwards we will review production periodically and adjust as necessary,” the spokeswoman said. The production cut is another sign of problems in Europe’s biofuel industry after the EU in March removed duties on biodiesel imports Argentine and Indonesian producers following the end of legal proceedings at the European Court of Justice.  The EU’s removal of duties on low-price biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia created a surge in EU imports forcing European producers to cut production in coming months. EU producers say biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia gets unfair state support enabling it to be sold at low prices in Europe.  U.S. agribusiness group Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N) said in March it would suspend production at a major biodiesel plant in Germany because of increasing cheap imports.

2018-05-16,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Hamburg said on Wednesday it had begun putting up signs to enforce what will be the first ban on older diesel vehicles from streets in a major German city, after a court ruled in February that cities were entitled to impose such bans. Hamburg’s environmental authorities said on Wednesday they had put up around 100 signs this week announcing the ban in two streets and offering directions for alternative routes. German cities are under pressure to meet legal clean air targets to reduce illness caused by emissions. European car companies have invested heavily in diesel, which produces less of the carbon that causes global warming than gasoline engines, but more of other pollutants blamed for health problems. The prospect that cities could ban dirtier diesel vehicles has wide implications for the future of Europe’s car industry.   Hamburg is still waiting to find out from the court whether it will be allowed to apply the ban to all cars with engines that fail to meet the 2014 “Euro 6” standard, or only to the far smaller number that fail to meet the 2009 “Euro 5” standard. “We expect to put the driving ban into effect in May. Therefore, it’s necessary to receive a written statement of the ruling from the administrative court in Leipzig,” said Bjoern Marzahn, Hamburg environment authority spokesman. Environmentalists say the measures in Hamburg do not go far enough because they target only selected streets where air monitoring stations are in place. They worry that diversions will only prompt car owners to drive longer distances. “There are only four monitoring stations in Hamburg and it is evaluated according to their results, although the European Union limits are breached in many parts of the city,” Paul Schmid, spokesman for the Environment and Nature Conservation Association (BUND) in Hamburg, said. The court has promised a final statement by the end of this week, Marzahn said, adding that no fines will be levied during an initial phase of the ban, allowing drivers to get used to it. The city had considered other alternatives to improve air quality, such as deploying electric buses, but concluded that a partial diesel ban would be the most effective solution. “We as environment authorities are responsible for air purity and it’s our responsibility to make sure inhabitants don’t get sick (because of pollution),” Marzahn said. “I believe there is sympathy for this from car drivers.” Reporting by Riham Alkousaa; Editing by Peter Graff",https://uk.reuters.com/article/germany-emissions-hamburg/hamburg-takes-steps-to-impose-germanys-first-big-city-ban-on-old-diesels-idUKL2N1SN077,16 May 2018,"Hamburg said on Wednesday it had

2018-05-16,"(Adds details, prices, quotes) May 16 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil stockpiles fell last week as exports hit a record high and refinery ramped up output, while gasoline inventories dropped more than expected ahead of the summer driving season, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude inventories fell 1.4 million barrels in the week to May 11, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 763,000 barrels. Net U.S. crude imports fell 411,000 barrels per day as exports rose to a record 2.6 million bpd, benefiting of late from the widening spread between U.S. crude oil and global benchmark Brent, which responds more to world supply outlook. WTCLc1-LCOc1 Crude production continued to grow to record highs, rising 20,000 bpd to 10.72 million bpd last week, the EIA said, though weekly figures are considered less reliable than monthly data. The United States in February produced 10.3 million bpd, a record. Refining activity rose, particularly in the Midwest, as maintenance season ebbs as summer driving season heats up. Refinery crude runs rose by 149,000 bpd, while refinery utilization rates rose by 0.7 percentage points to 91.1 percent of overall capacity. U.S. Midwest refinery utilization rates increased last week to 96 percent of capacity, the highest since at least 2010 seasonally. Still, gasoline stocks were down sharply, falling by a surprise 3.8 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.4 million-barrel drop. Gasoline demand is up 0.7 percent from last year over the past four weeks to 9.4 million bpd. That demand is anticipated to increase as summer driving season kicks in. “It’s a bullish report. The gasoline number was pretty good... which you would expect coming up to Memorial Day and summer driving season,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho. The International Energy Agency said on Wednesday that oil inventories worldwide had tightened after a year-and-a-half of supply cuts by major oil producers, along with Venezuela’s ongoing economic crisis that has sapped its production. As oil approaches $80 a barrel, demand may suffer, the IEA said. Prices were little changed after the data. U.S. crude fell 15 cents to $71.16 a barrel as of 10:45 a.m. EDT (1445 GMT), while Brent lost 20 cents to $78.22 a barrel. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures rose by 53,000 barrels, the EIA said. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell 92,000 barrels, versus expectations for a 2.2 million-barrel drop, the EIA data showed.

2018-05-16,"May 16 (Reuters) - French energy company Total said on Wednesday it may pull out of the Iran South Pars 11 (SP11) energy project in light of U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from an international nuclear deal and reinstate sanctions on Tehran. Following is a list of deals and memoranda of understanding (MoU) that Iran has signed with foreign companies, which could be under threat amid speculation Washington may impose secondary sanctions on firms that continue to work with Tehran. * Total said on Wednesday it would pull out of the South Pars project and unwind all related operations by Nov. 4 “unless Total is granted a specific project waiver by U.S. authorities with the support of the French and European authorities.” The company had signed the South Pars deal in November 2016, becoming the first oil major to agree a big transaction with Tehran in the wake of the 2015 international nuclear agreement. Industry sources said in October 2017 that China’s top oil and gas company CNPC would consider taking over Total’s stake in the project if the French company left. * Norwegian oil and gas company DNO said in November 2016 it was the second Western energy company after Total to sign a deal with Iran under which it agreed to study the development of the Changuleh oilfield in western Iran. * Shell signed a provisional deal in December 2016 to develop Iranian oil and gas fields South Azadegan, Yadavaran and Kish. But its annual report published in 2017 showed it had bought only three cargoes of Iranian oil since the easing of sanctions, in a sign of the legal difficulties hampering trade. * South Korea’s Daewoo Engineering and Construction (Daewoo E&C) signed a MoU in 2015 to carry out construction of an oil refinery in Bandar Jask on the southern coast of Iran. * Norway’s Aker Solutions signed a MoU in May 2016 to modernise the Iranian oil industry. * Austria’s OMV signed a MoU in May 2016 for projects in the Zagros area of western Iran and the Fars field in the south. In June 2017, OMV and Russia’s Gazprom Neft announced a MoU to work in Iran’s oil sector. * Italy’s Saipem signed MoUs in 2016 to cooperate on Iranian pipeline projects, upgrading of refineries and development of the Tous gas field in the northeastern province of Khorasan Razavi. * BASF’s Wintershall oil and gas exploration arm signed a MoU with the National Iranian Oil Company in April 2016. In February 2017, it said it was in talks about a possible investment in Iran, but no decision was on the cards because of uncertainty over the status of economic sanctions. * In January 2017, Iran named 29 companies from more than a dozen countries as being allowed to bid for oil and gas projects using a new, less restrictive contract model. The firms included Shell, Total, Italy’s Eni, Malaysia’s Petronas and Russia’s Gazprom and Lukoil, as well as companies from China, Austria, Japan and elsewhere. * Italy’s Eni signed an agreement with Iran in June 2017 for feasibility studies to develop an oil field and a gas field. * India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd in late February signed an initial non-binding agreement with an Iranian company to develop the Susangerd oilfield in the south of Iran, a company source said. * The National Iranian Oil Company signed a deal in March with Russia’s Zarubezhneft to develop two oilfields in Iran fields, according to SHANA, the news site of the Iranian oil ministry. * Norway’s Saga Energy signed a 2.5 billion euro ($3 billion) deal in October 2017 to build solar power plants in Iran. * U.S. planemaker Boeing agreed in December 2016 to sell 80 aircraft, including 15 Boeing 777-300ER long-range jets, to IranAir. Last month, Boeing said it had found new homes for jets it hoped to deliver to Iran this year, adding it had no Iranian deliveries scheduled or part of production this year. * European planemaker Airbus said in December 2016 it had sealed a deal to sell 100 jets to IranAir. Only three have so far been delivered. * Iran completed a deal in April 2017 to buy 20 aircraft from European turboprop maker ATR, half-owned by Airbus and Leonardo. * Germany’s Lufthansa said in April 2017 it was in talks with IranAir to provide catering, maintenance and pilot training. * Iran’s Aseman Airlines agreed in April 2017 to buy 30 Boeing 737 MAX jets. * Iran’s Zagros Airlines signed a MoU in June 2017 to buy 20 Airbus A320neo and eight A330neo aircraft. * Iran Airtour signed a MoU in June 2017 for 45 Airbus A320neos. * Germany’s Siemens signed a contract in October 2016 to upgrade Iran’s railway network. It was also to supply components for 50 diesel-electric locomotives to Iran. * China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation, signed a 2.2 billion-euro deal in May 2017 with Iran’s MAPNA for electrification of a high-speed rail line between Tehran and Mashhad, according to Iran’s Financial Tribune newspaper. * Iran’s state rail company and its Italian counterpart, Ferrovie dello Stato (FS) signed a final agreement worth 1.2 billion euros in July 2017 to build a high-speed railway between the Iranian cities of Qom and Arak. * French train maker and manufacturing group Alstom signed a deal in July 2017 for a joint venture to build metro and suburban rail carriages in Iran. * French carmaker PSA had signed Iranian production deals worth 700 million euros ($768 million) by May 2017. PSA said in January it sold 444,600 vehicles in Iran last year. * Germany’s Volkswagen said in July 2017 it would start exporting cars to Iran, returning to the market after more than 17 years. But the company said in October 2017 its Spanish arm Seat was no longer looking at the possibility of entering the Iranian car market. * France’s Renault said in August 2017 it had signed a joint venture deal in Iran following an initial partnership agreement a year earlier. The new venture included an engineering and purchasing centre to support the development of local suppliers as well as a plant with an initial production capacity of 150,000 vehicles a year, supplementing Renault’s existing capacity of 200,000 vehicles a year in the country. * Germany’s Mercedes-Benz Trucks signed a contract with Iran Khodro in September 2017, laying the foundation for resuming distribution of its trucks in Iran. * Autoneum, a Swiss maker of sound and heat shields for automobiles, in December 2017 announced a licensing deal for Iranian vehicle supplier Ayegh Khodro Toos to produce carpets, inner dashes and floor insulators for carmakers Iran Khodro and PSA, with production due to start in 2019. * Oberbank signed a deal with Iran in September 2017, enabling it to finance new ventures there and making it one of the first European banks to do so since sanctions were eased. But major global banks have shied away from handling Iran-related business. Among them is HSBC, which has said it has no intention of doing any new business involving Iran. Danish insulin supplier Novo Nordisk decided in September 2015 to invest 70 million euros in a factory in Iran, adding 160 staff to the 130 it maintained in the country throughout the sanctions. Medicines were excepted from the sanctions but shipping drugs into the country was troublesome, due to tight curbs on financial transactions and restrictions on technology. $1 = 0.8445 euros

2018-05-16,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece’s biggest gas company DEPA said on Wednesday it had agreed to sell its holding in a local gas supplier to Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI) for 57 million euros ($67 million). Under the agreement, state-controlled DEPA will sell its 51 percent stake in Thessaloniki-Thessaly Gas. Eni already holds a 49 percent stake in that company. Under a bailout-sanctioned scheme to unbundle gas supply from distribution and boost competition in the industry, Greece needs to eliminate potential conflicts of interest between DEPA and domestic gas suppliers. DEPA will stay in the broader Athens region but will pull out of the rest of Greece.  DEPA is also in talks to buy out Shell’s (RDSa.L) 49 percent stake in another gas supplier, Attiki Gas Supply Company, and a gas distributor in Athens and become the sole stakeholder in the two companies, sources close to the matter told Reuters. One of the sources said the deal could be worth about 150 million euros. DEPA, 65 percent owned by the Greek state, imports gas mainly from Russia and supplies power producers, big industries and households across Greece.

2018-05-16,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A new “plastic-free” logo launched in Britain on Wednesday will allow shoppers to identify products with plastic packaging, as companies come under growing pressure to use green alternatives. Eight million tonnes of plastic - bottles, packaging and other waste - are dumped into the ocean every year, killing marine life and entering the human food chain, according to the United Nations. Growing concern from the public and lawmakers about the damage to the environment means food and drink manufacturers and retailers are under pressure to act on plastic waste. “We all know the damage our addiction to plastic has caused, we want to do the right thing and buy plastic-free,” said Sian Sutherland, co-founder of A Plastic Planet, the British-based campaign group behind the new label. “But it is harder than you think, and a clear, no-nonsense label is much needed. Finally, shoppers can be part of the solution not the problem.” British supermarket giant Iceland, Dutch supermarket Ekoplaza, which launched a plastic-free aisle earlier this year, and British tea company teapigs are among the first companies to adopt the label. Last month, more than 40 companies including Britain’s biggest supermarkets, Coca Cola, Nestle and Procter & Gamble , signed up to the UK Plastics Pact, pledging to eliminate unnecessary single-use plastic packaging by 2025. In January, privately-owned Iceland became the first British supermarket to promise to eliminate plastic packaging from all of its own-brand products. “With the grocery retail sector accounting for more than 40 percent of plastic packaging in the UK, it’s high time that Britain’s supermarkets came together to take a lead,” said Iceland’s managing director Richard Walker in a statement. In 2015 Britain introduced a charge for plastic bags which has led to an 80 percent reduction in plastic bag use since 2015. Nearly 200 nations late last year signed a U.N. resolution to eliminate plastic pollution in the sea, a move some hope will pave the way to a legally binding treaty.

2018-05-16,"(Adds ANALYSIS tag) * Oil and gas reserves life falls below 12 years * Reserves life lowest in at least 20 years * Companies focusing more on quality of reserves * Graphic: Oil Majors reserves life - sector (tmsnrt.rs/2vAiFLX?eikon=true) By Ron Bousso LONDON, May 16 (Reuters) - A decade ago, the news that the world’s top oil and gas companies had less than 12 years of production left in their reserves might have caused a panicked sell-off in their shares. But as consumers try to move away from fossil fuels to cleaner and cheaper energy sources, investors and executives say reserve size is no longer the gold standard for measuring the value and health of a company. The cost of developing existing reserves and the amount of carbon those reserves produce has now become more important, they say. This is leading to a profound shift in company strategies. “The quality of reserves and the commercial viability of reserves has eclipsed the quantity of reserves by far in recent years,” said Adi Karev, Global Leader for Oil and Gas at EY. The sector is emerging from one of its longest and deepest downturns after an oil price slump that started in 2014. The largest publicly-traded oil companies — Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, France’s Total, BP, Equinor (formerly Statoil) and Italy’s Eni — have adapted. They saved money by cutting jobs and increasing technology spending and now make more money with oil at $60 a barrel than they did at $100. But they also cut spending on exploration for new resources and development of new fields. This led to a decline in reserves. An analysis by Reuters and Guinness Asset Management of the annual reports of those eight companies shows that the size of their oil and gas reserves, when added together, fell to 91 billion barrels in 2017. That was the lowest since the same amount in 2005. The reserves of Exxon Mobil, the largest company, shrank by 16 percent since the slump began in 2014. Shell’s reserves fell 6.5 percent since then despite the $54 billion acquisition of BG Group in 2016. BP and Chevron’s oil and gas reserves increased by a small 5 percent since 2014. Eni was the only one to significantly boost its reserves by over 20 percent thanks to the discovery of the giant Zohr gas field off the coast of Egypt. The cumulative reserve life - the number of years a company can sustain its current production levels with existing reserves - of the eight companies fell to 11.7 years in 2017. That was the lowest level in at least 20 years although that drop is also the result of a sharp increase in production. Reuters does have access to data going back beyond 1998. Exxon’s reserves life shrank from 17 years in 2014 to 15 in 2017. Eni’s from 10.6 to 10.1 years despite its discoveries. Shell slipped from 12 to 9 years over the period. “There is clear deterioration (in reserves) and this will be a problem in time,” according to Jonathan Waghorn, manager of the energy fund at Guinness Asset Management. But for now, “10-12 year’s reserve life should be fine, so it is not a materially important component between the Majors.” With electric vehicles on the ascent and a peak for fuel demand on the horizon, the focus on the reserves is shifting to the quality of the reserves rather than the quantity “Some reserves are more efficient than others,” Eldar Saetre, chief executive officer of Norwegian oil giant Equinor told Reuters. “At some point we see a shrinking oil and gas industry, when that will be I do not know, but then it is really important that the best barrels come in and that will be increasingly a competitive factor.” Some companies are already changing strategies to adapt to the new focus. Oil prices are not expected to rise sharply in the long-term and governments are seeking to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. This means firms are adjusting by setting ceilings for the cost of projects, often below $35 a barrel. Oil reached a $80 a barrel this month, the highest since late 2014. Crude oil and natural gas have different grades and the cost of pumping them can vary hugely. Saudi Arabia’s oil is easier and therefore cheaper to extract than Angola’s complex deepwater wells. Canada’s oil sands have become less attractive due to their high cost of extraction and high carbon intensity. Exxon wrote down a large part of its Canadian oil reserves in 2017. Its largest rival, Shell, has sold most of its Canadian assets in recent years. North American shale which has emerged over the past decade can be developed relatively quickly and at low cost, in contrast to multi-billion dollar deepwater projects that take years to develop. The Permian basin in Texas, the heartland of the shale oil boom in recent years, saw production costs drop sharply to as low as $30 a barrel. Exxon and U.S. rival Chevron have both acquired large acreage in the Permian in recent years. Shell is also expanding in U.S. shale. The Gulf of Mexico also has low extraction costs because it has large reservoirs of oil and some infrastructure is already located there such as services companies and onshore bases. Statoil and Total have bought exploration acreage in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in recent months. Brazil’s pre-salt reserves also have low costs as there are huge reservoirs and also some existing infrastructure. All eight companies are there and several have recently sharply increased their production in the basin. “We are now getting to the point that the focus on efficiencies and producing reserves at a low level is what investors expect,” Karev said.

2018-05-16,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors are investigating a cyber attack on a subsidiary of German energy firm EnBW (EBKG.DE) by unknown hackers last summer, the prosecutor’s office said on Wednesday. The Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported on Tuesday that hackers had breached the networks of NetCom BW last summer, but did not gain access to the computer system it uses to control energy supplies. The hack was not publicly disclosed at the time. Germany’s BSI federal cyber agency on Wednesday said it had assessed the incident and that there was no evidence to suggest that the company’s operations had been affected. “The Chief Federal Prosecutor has opened a preliminary investigation in connection with the incident,” it said, without naming the company involved or providing additional details. A spokesman for the prosecutor’s office confirmed the investigation was underway but gave no further details. A spokeswoman for EnBW confirmed the incident in a statement, but said it was detected early and caused no damage.  “Unknown people attacked the telecommunications network of the EnBW subsidiary NetCom. The attackers breached the network by hacking the the portal used by an external service provider and had access to a limited portion of the internet traffic for a period of a few minutes,” she said. “No damage was caused as a result,” she said, adding that the company immediately notified government authorities.

2018-05-16,"* Geopolitics drags down most Gulf markets * But Alawwal shares jump on bank merger news * Deal will create third-largest Saudi bank * Dubai Islamic Bank weighs on index * Dana Gas, ADNOC Distribution up in Abu Dhabi By Davide Barbuscia DUBAI, May 16 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s Alawwal Bank soared on Wednesday after the announcement of its planned merger with Saudi British Bank, while most Gulf stock markets closed in negative territory on the back of rising geopolitical concerns. The general weakness was in line with Asian markets, which slipped on Wednesday after North Korea called off talks with Seoul, throwing a U.S.-North Korean summit into doubt. Oil prices were also not supportive, down because of a rise in U.S. crude inventory and despite ongoing output cuts by producer group OPEC and the looming U.S. sanctions against Iran. In Saudi Arabia the index lost 1 percent, with most companies in the oil and gas and petrochemical sectors shedding some value. Blue-chip Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) shed 1 percent. But banks were in the spotlight, as Saudi British Bank (SABB) and Alawwal Bank agreed on a merger that, once completed, will create the country’s third-largest bank, with assets of around $77 billion. “Over the last 12 months we have seen a wave of consolidation announcements across the GCC banking sector, as the industry struggles to identify areas of growth following reduced economic activity due to lower oil prices,” said Salman Bajwa, senior executive officer at Emirates NBD Asset Management. If approved, the deal would see SABB acquire smaller peer Alawwal for 18.6 billion riyals ($4.96 billion) in what would be the first major banking merger in the kingdom in two decades. The announcement on Wednesday implied a valuation premium of around 28 percent on the shares of Alawwal Bank. Shares in Alawwal jumped 10 percent to 13.92 riyals in its heaviest trade since April 2017, while SABB shares sank 4.5 percent as some investors bet the bank was overpaying. “In most M&A exercises, the smaller parties tend to benefit from being paid premiums by the bigger partners or acquirers. That is certainly true in this case,” Bajwa said. Stocks in other Saudi banks were mixed. National Commercial Bank (NCB) initially fell as it went ex-dividend but then rebounded to gain 0.6 percent. The bank announced the resignation of its chief executive, Mohammed al-Ghamdi, who will be replaced on an acting basis by Faisal Omar al-Sakkaf. Al-Sakkaf is expected to become chief executive permanently once formal procedures are completed, sources told Reuters. Separately, NCB said on Wednesday that its shareholders had approved a hike in the bank’s capital by 10 billion riyals via the issue of bonus shares. In Dubai the index slipped 0.2 percent as Dubai Islamic Bank dropped 1 percent to 4.83 dirhams ($1.32). Trading of the bank’s rights issue began on Wednesday, allowing the purchase of the stock at 3.11 dirhams; the rights plunged 11.0 percent to 1.62 dirhams. In Abu Dhabi, where the index edged down 0.1 percent, Dana Gas rose 1 percent after saying it received a dividend payment of $22.8 million from Pearl Petroleum Co, which produces natural gas in Iraqi Kurdistan. ADNOC Distribution gained 1.2 percent after reporting a rise in first quarter net profit to 542.2 million dirhams, a 12.1 percent increase year on year, in line with some analysts’ expectations. * The index shed 1 percent to 7,958 points. * The index lost 0.2 percent to 2,932 points. * The index slipped 0.1 percent to 4,467 points. * The index gained 0.3 percent to 8,950 points. * The index edged down 0.1 percent to 4,776 points. * The index slipped 0.1 percent to 1,273 points. * The index shed 0.7 percent to 4,654 points. * The index was flat at 16,993 points.

2018-05-16,"COLOMBO, May 16 (Reuters) - Iran has agreed to build a new oil refinery for Sri Lanka in addition to upgrading its ageing 50,000 barrel per day (bpd) state-owned refinery, Sri Lankan cabinet spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said on Wednesday. Iranian officials pledged the new refinery when Sri Lanka President Maithripala Sirisena made an official visit to Tehran over the weekend, the first leader to go to Iran since U.S. President Donald Trump reimposed U.S. economic sanctions. “They even agreed to help Sri Lanka to build a new refinery,” Senaratne told Reuters when asked if Sri Lanka sought assistance to refurbish its current refinery. “We only spoke about the concepts and they promised to send a team (for further talks).” Senaratne did not elaborate how the Sri Lankan government would deal with Iranian financial transactions in the face of U.S. sanctions. Sri Lanka has a single, 50,000 bpd oil refinery in Colombo suburb Sapugaskanda, built by Iran in 1969 to refine Iranian light crude. However, when toughened sanctions were imposed on Tehran in 2012 to curb its nuclear ambitions, state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) was forced to look for other light crudes. The existing refinery accounts for 30 percent of Sri Lanka’s fuel requirement, but the head of CPC last week said that upgrading “may not be the solution” because Sri Lanka needs a refinery capable of handling all types of crude. Iran’s offer comes as Chinese, Middle East and Russian companies are in “preliminary discussions” to build a 100,000 bpd refinery for CPC. Two Chinese companies have jointly bid for a 100,000 bpd refinery, with annual output of about 5 million tonnes a year, in the southern town of Hambantota, where China controls a sea port and plans an industrial zone. Sri Lanka is still in talks about the Hambantota refinery, though the government has blocked a proposal by the Chinese companies to sell fuel locally. Sri Lanka has also discussed another 100,000 bpd refinery in partnership with Indian Oil Corp, but there has been no progress on that plan.

2018-05-16,"LONDON (Reuters) - While major traders expect consolidation in the crowded oil trading sphere, small Lugano-based firm Lord Energy is finding new niches and taking a bet by entering into Russian oil.  Hazim Nada set up the Swiss trading firm, now called Lord Energy, a decade ago to deal with coal from Indonesia and South Africa and cement in the Mediterranean market.  This month it is loading its first cargo of Nigerian crude and is adding Russian oil to the list in June, after shifting to crude trading in 2015 dealing with oil from Algeria, Colombia, Brazil and Libya.  Nada, now managing director, said his firm has signed a six-month term deal with the marketing arm of China’s CEFC to load an 80,000 tonne cargo of Russian Urals a month from the Black Sea port of Novorossisk. CEFC markets two cargoes of Urals a month from the port.  CEFC has a larger contract with Russia’s Rosneft (ROSN.MM) for cargoes of ESPO Blend crude that loads in the Far East. Lord Energy’s end-users have been concentrated in Asia and the United States but with Urals it is also hoping to sell to European refiners. Nada said he has been blending oil grades to enter China and has re-opened some old arbitrages. “We currently move about 3-4 million barrels of crude oil per month. We plan to triple this over the next 18 months. Our key to success has been in developing new markets for either established grades or finding new niches for difficult grades,” Nada said.  “We have been the first to open the market for (Algerian) Saharan Blend into Australia for over 35 years and we reopened the arbitrage into South Korea... and managed to find a blend for it to take into the Chinese market. We also sold the first cargo of Saharan into the Chinese private sector.” A combination of low oil price volatility, increasing market transparency and rising compliance costs have hit profits of oil traders. Lord Energy, which also has a presence in Houston and Singapore, aims to expand into U.S. exports and imports and is looking to move into liquefied natural gas next year, Nada said.

2018-05-16,"(Repeats with no changes. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: Asia leads global LNG demand: tmsnrt.rs/2HfLB0b By Clyde Russell ADELAIDE, May 16 (Reuters) - Liquefied natural gas (LNG) producers around the globe are once again considering new investments as expectations of a glut in supply wither away in the face of strong, China-led demand growth in Asia. Given it takes several years to go from a Final Investment Decision (FID) to producing cargoes of the super-chilled fuel, however, the industry may be acting too late to prevent a supply shortfall by the middle of next decade. Much of the focus this week at an annual oil and gas conference in Australia - which is about to become the world’s top exporter of LNG - was on what projects are viable and how quickly can they be developed. This was in stark contrast to the mood at previous events hosted by the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA), where executives had talked mainly about how to cut costs and the strategies needed to survive the predicted surplus of the fuel. The forecasts for a global glut were based on the market being swamped by eight new Australian LNG projects, plus at least four in the United States, as well a handful of others in frontier countries such as Mozambique. But the narrative of industry over-investment in capacity has been turned on its head by the spectacular growth of Chinese demand, which leapt 46 percent last year to 38.1 million tonnes. China is now the world’s second-biggest LNG buyer, behind Japan, and its demand has continued to grow rapidly, with first-quarter imports up 59 percent from a year ago to 12.4 million tonnes. China’s policy to replace coal with natural gas for uses such as residential heating and some industries is expected to continue to drive growth in LNG imports, although some moderation in the rate is likely in coming years. But other Asian countries are also stepping up LNG imports, including new buyers such as Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. At the height of the LNG construction boom of the past decade, forecasts of a surplus of as much as 50 million tonnes per annum around the start of the 2020s were not uncommon. While a surplus is still expected by most analysts, size estimates have been shrinking, and if China continues to grow demand at anything like its current pace, the surplus will likely disappear altogether. Wood Mackenzie analysts Saul Kavonic and Nicholas Browne, speaking on Tuesday on the sidelines of the APPEA conference, said the surplus was likely to be as little as 10 million tonnes in the early years of the 2020s. In a total market of more than 350 million tonnes a year, such a small surplus really amounts to a market that is more or less in balance. Kavonic and Browne also said that by 2025 the market was likely to switch to an annual deficit of about 50 million tonnes, and there simply aren’t enough projects being approved to meet the potential supply gap. In 2017, just one LNG project reached FID, that being the relatively small Coral floating LNG development in Mozambique. There is also a dearth of shovel-ready projects that can be approved and developed in time for 2025, with the best prospects in the United States, Canada and East Africa. In Australia, the likelihood of a new greenfield development is slim, given the massive capital costs of developing increasingly remote fields. There is instead the possibility of expanding existing operations, with the likely best bet being Woodside Petroleum’s plan to use the Scarborough field off the Western Australian coast to feed a new train at its Pluto LNG plant. For the rest of Australia, the industry seems to be concentrating on developing new fields to replace ones that are depleting, thus allowing the existing 80 million tonnes of capacity to continue operating. The evaporation of the expected LNG surplus may also have implications for pricing and contracting in the industry. LNG buyers have led the charge in recent years to end long-term, restrictive contracts linked to crude oil prices in favour of shorter-term or even spot deals with prices linked to LNG indexes or other natural gas prices, such as the U.S. benchmark Henry Hub. The buyers did this because they believed the balance of market power was shifting in their favour. They may now find resurgent producers kicking them back and demanding higher prices in order to guarantee supplies.

2018-05-16,"LONDON (Reuters) - A decade ago, the news that the world’s top oil and gas companies had less than 12 years of production left in their reserves might have caused a panicked sell-off in their shares.     But as consumers try to move away from fossil fuels to cleaner and cheaper energy sources, investors and executives say reserve size is no longer the gold standard for measuring the value and health of a company.  The cost of developing existing reserves and the amount of carbon those reserves produce has now become more important, they say. This is leading to a profound shift in company strategies. “The quality of reserves and the commercial viability of reserves has eclipsed the quantity of reserves by far in recent years,” said Adi Karev, Global Leader for Oil and Gas at EY. To view a graphic on Oil majors' reserves life, click: reut.rs/2rxoqFz The sector is emerging from one of its longest and deepest downturns after an oil price slump that started in 2014.  The largest publicly-traded oil companies — Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, France’s Total, BP, Equinor (formerly Statoil) and Italy’s Eni — have adapted. They saved money by cutting jobs and increasing technology spending and now make more money with oil at $60 a barrel than they did at $100. But they also cut spending on exploration for new resources and development of new fields. This led to a decline in reserves.  An analysis by Reuters and Guinness Asset Management of the annual reports of those eight companies shows that the size of their oil and gas reserves, when added together, fell to 91 billion barrels in 2017. That was the lowest since the same amount in 2005.   The reserves of Exxon Mobil, the largest company, shrank by 16 percent since the slump began in 2014. Shell’s reserves fell 6.5 percent since then despite the $54 billion acquisition of BG Group in 2016. BP and Chevron’s oil and gas reserves increased by a small 5 percent since 2014. Eni was the only one to significantly boost its reserves by over 20 percent thanks to the discovery of the giant Zohr gas field off the coast of Egypt.  The cumulative reserve life - the number of years a company can sustain its current production levels with existing reserves - of the eight companies fell to 11.7 years in 2017. That was the lowest level in at least 20 years although that drop is also the result of a sharp increase in production. Reuters does have access to data going back beyond 1998.    Exxon’s reserves life shrank from 17 years in 2014 to 15 in 2017. Eni’s from 10.6 to 10.1 years despite its discoveries. Shell slipped from 12 to 9 years over the period. “There is clear deterioration (in reserves) and this will be a problem in time,” according to Jonathan Waghorn, manager of the energy fund at Guinness Asset Management. But for now, “10-12 year’s reserve life should be fine, so it is not a materially important component between the Majors.”  With electric vehicles on the ascent and a peak for fuel demand on the horizon, the focus on the reserves is shifting to the quality of the reserves rather than the quantity  “Some reserves are more efficient than others,” Eldar Saetre, chief executive officer of Norwegian oil giant Equinor told Reuters. “At some point we see a shrinking oil and gas industry, when that will be I do not know, but then it is really important that the best barrels come in and that will be increasingly a competitive factor.”  Some companies are already changing strategies to adapt to the new focus. Oil prices are not expected to rise sharply in the long-term and governments are seeking to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. This means firms are adjusting by setting ceilings for the cost of projects, often below $35 a barrel. Oil reached a $80 a barrel this month, the highest since late 2014.  Crude oil and natural gas have different grades and the cost of pumping them can vary hugely. Saudi Arabia’s oil is easier and therefore cheaper to extract than Angola’s complex deepwater wells.  Canada’s oil sands have become less attractive due to their high cost of extraction and high carbon intensity. Exxon wrote down a large part of its Canadian oil reserves in 2017. Its largest rival, Shell, has sold most of its Canadian assets in recent years. North American shale which has emerged over the past decade can be developed relatively quickly and at low cost, in contrast to multi-billion dollar deepwater projects that take years to develop. The Permian basin in Texas, the heartland of the shale oil boom in recent years, saw production costs drop sharply to as low as $30 a barrel.  Exxon and U.S. rival Chevron have both acquired large acreage in the Permian in recent years. Shell is also expanding in U.S. shale.  The Gulf of Mexico also has low extraction costs because it has large reservoirs of oil and some infrastructure is already located there such as services companies and onshore bases. Statoil and Total have bought exploration acreage in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in recent months. Brazil’s pre-salt reserves also have low costs as there are huge reservoirs and also some existing infrastructure. All eight companies are there and several have recently sharply increased their production in the basin.  “We are now getting to the point that the focus on efficiencies and producing reserves at a low level is what investors expect,” Karev said.

2018-05-16,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A power cut hit large part of Pakistan on Wednesday, suspending work at factories and businesses in its industrial heartland and highlighting the challenges successive governments have faced in getting to grips with chronic power shortages. The power cut could play into politics in the run-up to a general election, expected in July, given that the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, had made ending power blackouts a central promise in its last election campaign. Zafar Yab Khan, a spokesman for the ministry of energy, said the blackout had hit most of eastern and northern Pakistan after a major section of the national grid “tripped”, or suddenly shut down. “Due to tripping of a major plant, the north system is off,” Khan said. He said the cause was not known but was being investigated. Khan said the problem affected Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in the northwest and Punjab in the east, Pakistan’s most populous province and its industrial and agricultural heartland.  Power in the south was not interrupted. Punjab’s capital, Lahore, was among the major cities affected. The power was also out in the national capital, Islamabad. Khan said it was hoped power would be restored soon with “gradual restoration of grids and feeders.”      Media showed pictures of people sweltering at the hottest time of the year in markets and offices. The ruling party won the last election, in 2013, vowing to end power outages before the next polls. Power cuts and scheduled outages, known as load shedding, in urban areas have been sharply reduced from about 12 hours a day previously to only occasional outages now.

2018-05-16,"SOFIA (Reuters) - European Union leaders will explore options on Wednesday for keeping the Iran nuclear deal alive and shielding their reviving economic cooperation with Tehran after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the pact.  But the 28 EU leaders are not expected to make any quick decisions during their first meeting on the matter since Trump quit the accord, highlighting how U.S. clout in international trade and finance limits the Europeans’ scope for action. “I would like our debate to reconfirm without any doubt that as long as Iran respects the provisions of the deal, the EU will also respect it,” the chairman of the gathering, Donald Tusk, said before the meeting in the Bulgarian capital Sofia. The leaders of Britain, France and Germany - the three EU signatories of the 2015 deal, which gave Iran sanctions relief in exchange for curbing its nuclear programme but which Trump dismissed as “the worst deal ever” - will brief their peers.  The head of the bloc’s executive, Jean-Claude Juncker of the European Commission, will also present options the leaders have to shield European investments in Iran and the slowly-reviving economic cooperation, which many EU states hope to benefit from.   These include protecting European companies dealing with Iran from U.S. sanctions, which in practice would be very difficult, allowing the European Investment Bank to invest there and coordinating euro-denominated credit lines from EU states. Foreign ministers of Germany, France and Britain met Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Brussels on that on Tuesday and tasked their experts to come up with measures for a meeting of their deputies in Vienna next week. But a senior EU official admitted there was no silver-bullet solution and that it might “take some time” for the bloc to come up with what is expected to be a complex matrix of national and EU-level measures. “We would stay calm here, there is no need for the meeting on Wednesday to take decisions on specific modalities of the mechanisms that are to shield the interests of European companies,” the official said.  “But when it comes to consensus to shield economic interests in Iran, it is there and will be reconfirmed on Wednesday.” The EU’s top energy official, Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete, is heading to Iran on May 18-21 for talks on energy cooperation, a symbolic gesture from the EU that it wants to stay engaged despite the U.S. withdrawal.  In his criticism of the accord, which the other signatories Russia and China also want to uphold, Trump has said it did not go far enough in restraining Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons, while not addressing its missile programme and involvement in various conflicts in the Middle East.  The EU has since sought to address some of his concerns but Trump was not convinced, and his move left the EU scrambling to salvage an accord they see as a key element of international security and a diplomatic success, as well as wondering about their future cooperation with Washington.  “It’s the leaders’ first face-to-face meeting since Trump’s announcement. It’s too early for specific decisions, they have to see where they are,” said a senior EU diplomat. “We want to do this, that’s for sure. But it’s still in the making, we don’t have all the answers yet. It will take a bit of time.”    Reporting by Gabriela Baczynska, Editing by William Maclean",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-europe/eu-leaders-explore-ways-to-save-iran-economic-ties-from-us-sanctions-idUKL5N1SN398,16 May 2018,"European Union leaders will

2018-05-16,"* Oil prices at $79 are ‘not yet’ too high - OPEC source * Saudi view is producers can react only to real shortage * Venezuelan oil output decline is becoming a concern By Alex Lawler and Rania El Gamal LONDON/DUBAI, May 16 (Reuters) - OPEC sees oil’s rally towards $80 a barrel as a short-term spike driven by geopolitics rather than any supply shortage, four OPEC delegates said, a sign the group is not rushing yet to rethink its supply-cutting agreement. The view of top exporter Saudi Arabia is that any brief, speculator-driven jump in oil prices is not sufficient grounds for producers to boost output, an OPEC source familiar with the kingdom’s thinking said. For such a decision to occur, the rally would need to be driven by data pointing to a supply impact, the source said. The four OPEC delegates said the latest rise in prices stemmed more from concern about U.S. sanctions on Iran and tension in the Middle East, rather than a suddenly tighter balance between oil supply and demand. “Prices are high just because of the tensions,” one of the OPEC delegates, who declined to be identified, said. Since last year, oil has been supported by a deal by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, plus Russia and other non-members, to cut output. Prices have risen about 40 percent since the accord began in January 2017. Global benchmark Brent crude on Tuesday hit $79.47, the highest since November 2014, before easing below $78 on Wednesday. Prices could rally further before declining, according to some in OPEC. “It may exceed $80 and then go down,” one of the sources said. In any case, the extent of the rally has yet to cause any real concern. “Not yet,” said another delegate, asked whether oil at $79 was too high. U.S. President Donald Trump last month accused OPEC of “artificially” boosting prices, putting pressure on producers to cool the market and in turn drawing a rebuke from some OPEC members. OPEC and its allies are cutting production by about 1.8 million barrels per day, almost 2 percent of world supply, until the end of 2018. Oil ministers meet on June 22-23 to review the policy. The producers’ original goal was to reduce oil inventories to the five-year average. While this has largely been achieved, ministers have said other metrics should be considered such as oil industry investment, suggesting they are in no hurry yet to wind down supply cuts. Nonetheless, delegates pointed to growing concern about a decline in Venezuelan output due to economic crisis, which officials had downplayed when inventories were higher. OPEC has over-delivered on the supply cut due in part to lower Venezuelan supply. OPEC has no official target price for oil. Saudi Arabia has emerged over the past year as OPEC’s leading supporter of measures to boost prices, however, a change from Riyadh’s previous, more moderate stance. The kingdom, keen to fund economic reforms, would be happy to see crude rise to $80 or even $100, industry sources told Reuters last month. Iran, once a keen OPEC price hawk, now wants lower prices than Saudi Arabia, and has said exporters should aim for crude around $60 to contain U.S. shale oil growth. “When oil prices rise due to geopolitical concern and not due to demand and supply and fundamentals, it cannot be reasonable,” a source familiar with Iranian thinking said of the current rally.

2018-05-16,"SOFIA (Reuters) - The Bulgarian government decided on Wednesday to ask parliament to lift a ban on the development of the 2,000-megawatt Belene nuclear power plant as it gears up to attract foreign investors to revive the project. Chinese state nuclear company CNNC has confirmed it is interested in the project, which is on the Danube river. Energy Minister Temenuzhka Petkova has said the Balkan country plans to launch a tender by the end of the year to pick a strategic investor for the plant, which is estimated to cost at least 10 billion euros (8.8 billion pounds). She has invited France’s Framatome, majority controlled by EDF (EDF.PA), to take part. The European Investment Bank has also said it would look into the project. Bulgaria cancelled the project in 2012 after failing to find investors. The country also faced of pressure from the United States and the European Union to limit its energy dependence on Russia, which was under contract to build the nuclear plant. Bulgaria had to pay more than 620 million euros to Russia’s Rosatom for cancelling the project, but also received nuclear parts for two 1,000 megawatt reactors. As a result, the country has to decide what to do with the equipment. Sofia says it has already spent 3 billion levs ($1.82 billion) on Belene, which has a licensed site and equipment. But the government does not want to commit more public money, extend state guarantees for a possible loan, or sign any long-term electricity supply deals for the plant. “If there is no interest at the market, there are two options for the project - the sale of the equipment, which cannot be done under favourable conditions or the installation of one of the reactors at the Kozloduy plant,” Deputy Prime Minister Tomislav Donchev told a news conference.  Bulgaria already has two 1,000 megawatt Soviet-made nuclear reactors at its Kozloduy plant, which at present provide about 30 percent of the country’s electricity. Critics of the Belene project say that the investment does not justify the benefits and that the project as been a source of corrupt practices for decades. Martin Vladimirov, an analyst with the Centre for the Study of the Democracy, said Belene was type of a “zombie” project that cannot die because powerful lobbies are looking to cash in on lucrative procurement orders.

2018-05-16,"* Italian stocks slide in broader calm for European markets * North Korean talks cancellation rattles Asian markets * Euro hits new 2018 low with dollar close to new 5-month high * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Tommy Wilkes LONDON, May 16 (Reuters) - Italian stocks slid on Wednesday after reports that the two parties seeking to form Italy’s next government might seek debt forgiveness, while the dollar ignored a pull-back in U.S. bond yields and rallied to a new 2018 high. Asian markets had earlier dipped after Pyongyang abruptly called off talks with Seoul, throwing a U.S.-North Korean summit into doubt, but that failed to rattle European stocks. Markets were also unfazed by Italian politics and the bigger focus was a rocketing dollar and rising U.S. borrowing costs, which have spooked investors in recent weeks and intensifed concern about damage to global demand, squeezing emerging markets. The dollar resumed its rally in European trading and reached a high for the year. That gain left the euro below $1.18 , its lowest since Dec. 19. However, with 10-year Treasury yields slipping back below 7-year highs reached earlier this week, most European stock markets traded close to flat. The exception was Italy. Reports suggested the 5-Star and League parties, trying to form a government after inconclusive March 4 elections, had written a draft coalition deal asking for debt forgiveness from the European Central Bank (ECB), frightening investors in the euro zone’s third-largest economy. “The proposal is surreal. Pretending the unilateral cancellation of 250 billion euros of debt bought by the ECB as part of the QE programme... would be absurd,” Anthilia Capital Partners fund manager Giuseppe Sersale said. “Even if unfeasible, the tone of the debate bolsters expectations there will be a stormy relationship with Europe and a further relaxation of financial discipline,” he said. Italian stocks fell more than 1.5 percent while the pan-European STOXX 600 slipped 0.12 percent. Euro zone banks slid an even bigger 1.71 percent, extending losses despite a League spokesman saying the request for cancellation of the debt was not in the official draft of the government programme. The difference in Italian 10-year government borrowing costs over German rose sharply to the highest since late March. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, slipped into negative territory. U.S. stock futures traded down 1.25 percent. North Korea’s cancellation of a June 12 summit in Singapore added to geopolitical worries for financial markets, given it could see tensions on the Korean peninsula flare again and damage U.S.-China efforts to resolve an ongoing trade dispute. “This will weigh on the Korean reconstruction beneficiaries that have had a strong run on peace and even reunification hopes recently,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note. “The broader risk for the region if talks do break down is that Trump no longer feels the need to keep China on side and could escalate trade tensions again.” Elsewhere, the 10-year yield slipped to 3.057 percent. Strong U.S. retail sales and factory data on Tuesday pushed the U.S. 10-year yield as high as 3.095 percent, its highest since July 2011, raising worries about higher borrowing costs for companies worldwide. The U.S. currency has enjoyed a blistering rally in recent weeks as investors focus on the Federal Reserve raising interest rates while central banks elsewhere push back policy tightening. Rising U.S. borrowing costs and a stronger dollar hit hardest in emerging markets, where investors are withdrawing money - particularly from countries with large deficits and big dollar funding needs. Argentina and Turkey have been at the centre of the sell-off, their weakness compounded by political frictions. The Turkish lira had been testing record lows against both the dollar and the euro but clawed higher after officials from the central bank said they would be prepared to act to halt the rout. President Tayyip Erdogan’s comments that he plans to take greater control of the economy have hammered the lira this week. The Indonesian rupiah hit a 2-1/2-year low while the Malaysian ringgit touched a four-month low overnight. In commodities markets, gold rebounded slightly after hitting a 4-1/2-month low the previous day on a strong dollar. Crude oil prices  declined but remained near recent highs amid concerns that U.S. sanctions on Iran may restrict crude exports from a major producer.

2018-05-16,"(Updates to add graphics; no change to text) By Ruma Paul and Oleg Vukmanovic DHAKA/LONDON, May 15 (Reuters) - Bangladesh has terminated talks with Swiss-based commodity trader Trafigura to install a small floating liquefied natural gas (LNG ) import terminal due to delays in agreeing terms, while rival trader Gunvor advances with a separate project. Once considered an energy backwater, Bangladesh’s LNG demand is set to hit 17.5 million tonnes annually by 2025 after importing its first cargo last month, and as traders target Southeast Asia’s booming gas markets to boost sales. Swiss-based commodity traders Trafigura, Vitol and Gunvor were all pursuing LNG import projects in Bangladesh, and smaller peer AOT Energy has provisionally agreed to supply the country with 1.25 million tonnes annually for 15 years. Trafigura, which also aims to build floating LNG import terminals in Pakistan and Britain, delayed agreeing terms to supply fertiliser producer Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Co. via a floating import facility on the Karnaphuli river, an official at a state-run energy firm said. “We are not going ahead with Trafigura, we can’t wait for long for their response,” a director at state-run energy firm Petrobangla’s LNG division told Reuters. Trafigura declined to comment. By contrast, rival trader Gunvor is moving forward with plans to set up a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) barge a stone’s throw from Trafigura’s proposed project, officials and industry sources said. Gunvor partnered with Belgium shipping firm Exmar on its Bangladesh venture, which will supply the Karnaphuli Fertilizer Company. Exmar announced on Monday it executed a 10-year charter with Gunvor for its 25,000-cubic-metre-capacity FSRU barge for Bangladesh. The barge, built by China’s Wison Offshore and Marine, is due to arrive in Bangladesh in the fourth-quarter this year and start operations after its full commissioning, Exmar said. A draft of a deal between Gunvor and state officials was vetted by the law ministry and the government’s purchase committee, officials said. Trader Vitol, meanwhile, is pushing to develop a small-scale FSRU alongside the ageing Sangu gas platform in the Bay of Bengal, after beating international oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, to the contract. A provisional deal under which AOT Energy will supply Bangladesh with LNG for 15 years is also moving closer to reality. In March a senior Petrobangla official travelled to Switzerland to verify AOT Energy’s financial strength after senior executives left the trading firm amid a shrinking credit line and losses in some trading operations. As a result of that meeting, Petrbangla is working on a final draft of a deal with AOT, officials there said. Bangladesh secured more competitive LNG pricing with AOT compared to its contract with Qatar, officials said. Under its 15-year, 2.5 million tonnes per annum deal with Qatar, Bangladesh agreed to pay 12.65 percent of the three-month average price of Brent oil plus a constant of $0.50 per mmBtu. Bangladesh also has a 10-year LNG import deal with Oman Trading International for 1 million tonnes annually. That LNG will be priced at 11.9 percent of the three-month average price of Brent plus a $0.40 per mmBtu constant.

2018-05-16,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A senior official at Iran’s state-owned oil supplier met Chinese buyers this week to ask them to maintain imports after U.S. sanctions kick in, three people familiar with the matter said, but failed to secure guarantees from the world’s biggest consumer of Iranian oil. The sources told Reuters Saeed Khoshrou, director of international affairs at the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), held separate meetings in Beijing on Monday with top executives at Chinese oil giant Sinopec’s trading unit and state oil trader Zhuhai Zhenrong Corp to discuss oil supplies and seek assurances from the Chinese buyers. Khoshrou was accompanying Iran’s foreign minister Javad Zarif in the first stop of a tour of world powers before travelling on to Europe. Tehran is mounting a last-ditch effort to save a 2015 nuclear deal that Washington has abandoned, with plans to impose unilateral sanctions including strict curbs on Iran’s oil exports.   “During the meeting, Mr. Khoshrou conveyed Mr. Zarif’s message that Iran hopes China will maintain the levels of imports,” said one person briefed on the meetings. China, the world’s top crude oil buyer, imported around 655,000 barrels a day on average from Iran in the first quarter of this year, according to official Chinese customs data - equivalent to more than a quarter of Iran’s total exports. Chinese executives did not make firm commitments but said as state oil companies they will fall in line with Beijing’s wishes, the person said. The visit was the NIOC marketing chief’s second to Beijing this year - he also met with Chinese customers about a month ago. A second person with direct knowledge of the discussion, said Chinese firms “shared the same hope to maintain purchases”, adding companies are still assessing the possible impact of the new sanctions.   The people familiar with the matter declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak to media. Sinopec and Zhuhai Zhenrong declined to comment. NIOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.    Buyers in Asia - including China - and Europe have said they will seek waivers from sanctions during a six-month grace period now in force. During a visit by Zarif to Brussels on Tuesday, European powers vowed to keep the 2015 nuclear deal alive without the United States by trying to keep Iran’s oil and investment flowing, but admitted they would struggle to provide the guarantees Tehran seeks.     China’s foreign ministry said last week it regretted the U.S. decision and called for parties involved to stick to diplomatic approaches to stay on track for full implementation of the 2015 accord.    Between 2012 and 2015, under European Union and U.S. sanctions to curb Iran’s nuclear program, Chinese companies took up nearly half of Iran’s oil exports, which were slashed by more than half and cost Tehran as much as $80 billion in lost revenue. Sinopec, Asia’s top refiner, and state-oil trader Zhuhai Zhenrong Corp together account for close to 90 percent of China’s total Iranian oil purchases. State oil group CNPC buys the rest.  Apart from supplies under annual contracts, CNPC and Sinopec have been lifting Iranian crude as part of their billions of dollars of investment at Iranian oil fields. reut.rs/2KpL4XE China has less of a banking issue in trading with Iran than some international peers. During previous sanctions Beijing used a domestic bank, Bank of Kunlun Co Ltd, to settle tens of billions dollars worth of oil transactions with Iran.

2018-05-16,"PARIS (Reuters) - French environment and energy minister Nicolas Hulot said he will decide this summer as to whether or not he remains a government minister, and did not exclude leaving if there is no clear government pledge to environmentally-friendly policies. Hulot - a former ecological activist, TV presenter and one of France’s most popular personalities - joined President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist government in May last year. He has fought to reduce the use of pesticides in agriculture and to speed up France’s energy transition, but his impact on government policy so far has been limited. Last year, Hulot himself had to announce Macron had dropped his election platform vow to cut the share of nuclear power in French electricity to 50 percent by 2025, from 75 percent today. Asked whether he agreed with the government’s environmental policies and whether he would follow up on earlier threats to leave the government, Hulot said on BFM Television that he was not satisfied and that a lot was left to be done.  “This summer we will take stock, with the President and the Prime Minister, it will be a moment of truth. ... If I feel that there is no progress I will draw my conclusions ... I am capable of leaving,” he told BFM TV on Wednesday.  Hulot - who has repeatedly said that state-controlled utility EDF needs to close several nuclear reactors and make a massive switch to renewable energy - made no comments regarding nuclear energy. A government-organised public debate about nuclear, which has received hardly any media coverage so far, is due to formulate recommendations on nuclear policy this summer.

2018-05-16,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global demand for oil is likely to moderate this year, as the price of crude nears $80 a barrel and many key importing nations no longer offer consumers generous fuel subsidies, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday.     The Paris-based IEA cut its forecast for global demand growth to 1.4 million barrels per day for 2018, from a previous estimate of 1.5 million bpd. Oil LCOc1 has risen 51 percent in the last year, driven by coordinated supply cuts and, this month, by concern over Iranian supply after the United States said it would reimpose sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear activities. “It would be extraordinary if such a large jump did not affect demand growth, especially as end-user subsidies have been reduced or cut in several emerging economies in recent years,” the IEA said. Oil inventories in the world’s richest nations, the most transparent and easy to track, have now fallen 1 million barrels below the five-year average, the level targeted by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners, as the group restrains crude output for a second year. “For now, the rapidly changing geopolitical landscape will move the attention away from stocks as producers and consumers consider how to limit volatility in the oil market,” the IEA said. “For its part, the IEA will monitor developments closely and is ready to act if necessary to ensure that markets remain well supplied.”  Iran, which produces around 3.8 million bpd and is OPEC’s third-largest supplier behind Saudi Arabia and Iraq, could face severe disruption to its exports. The IEA said the previous round of sanctions, which were lifted in early 2016, cut Iran’s crude exports by more than 1 million bpd.   “It is too soon to say what will happen this time, but we should examine whether other producers could step in to ensure an orderly flow of oil to the market and offset a disruption to Iranian exports,” the agency said. Iran exported 2.6 million bpd of crude in April, according to the oil ministry’s news agency SHANA.  The IEA estimates demand for OPEC’s crude will average 32.25 million bpd for the rest of 2018, compared with output of 32.12 million bpd in April. [OPEC/O].  World supply, meanwhile, rose 1.78 million bpd in April from a year earlier, driven predominantly by non-OPEC production. Economic crisis has driven Venezuelan production to its lowest in years, while natural decline in Mexico cut production by 175,000 bpd in April, down 8 percent year-on-year, the largest fall for any non-OPEC producer. Record output from the United States pushed non-OPEC supplies up by 2.1 million bpd year-on-year to 59.4 million bpd. Production elsewhere outside OPEC was flat to lower, the IEA said, noting declines in the North Sea and Brazil.  The IEA, which advises Western governments on energy policy, expects non-OPEC supply to rise by 1.87 million bpd in 2018, up from a previous forecast of 1.8 million bpd.

Power prices were cut 2.7 percent from May 1, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said in a statement on its website, following an earlier cut from April 1. The latest move will save companies 21.6 billion yuan ($3.39 billion) in costs, the NDRC said. The April cut saved firms 43 billion yuan, it said. As part of a broader plan laid out in Premier Li Keqiang’s work report in March, China aims to lower electricity prices by 10 percent before the end of this year. So far, NDRC has cut electricity prices by about 7 percent in total, spokeswoman Meng Wei said at a news briefing earlier on Wednesday. China reported on Tuesday weaker-than-expected investment and retail sales in April and a drop in home sales, clouding its economic outlook even as policymakers try to navigate debt risks and defuse a heated trade row with the United States. Industrial output growth was a bright spot, beating economists’ forecasts and up from a seven-month low in March. But some analysts believe the bounce may be short-lived. Despite an upbeat first quarter, economists still expect China’s economic growth to slow to 6.5 percent this year from 6.9 percent in 2017, with a regulatory crackdown and a growing trade dispute with the United States seen as key risks, a Reuters poll showed.

2018-05-16,"LONDON (Reuters) - The British government’s Clean Growth Strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will not be enough to meet legally binding climate change targets, a committee of cross-party lawmakers said on Wednesday. The strategy, launched last year, outlines investment in research and innovation to help reduce emissions which lead to global warming. Britain has committed to cut emissions by 80 percent by 2050 compared to 1990 levels and must produce proposals on how to reach its climate targets as part of carbon budgets set every five years. Although the amount of electricity generated from low-carbon energy doubled to a record 50 percent last year from 2009, there are signs that investment might have stalled in the past two years, the Environmental Audit Committee said in a report. Annual clean energy investment in Britain is now at its lowest level since 2008, threatening the country’s ability to meet its carbon budgets from 2023.  The report also said that changes to low-carbon energy policies in 2015 has undermined investor confidence and reduced the number of renewable energy projects in development. Added to that, disruption from the privatisation of the Green Investment Bank - which was set up by the government in 2012 to spur private investment in green projects but sold to a consortium led by Macquarie Bank last year - and a reduction in European Investment Bank lending following a vote to leave the EU might also have contributed to the dip in clean energy investment. “The government must urgently plug this policy gap and publish its plan to secure the investment required to meet the UK’s climate change targets,” said Mary Creagh, chair of the Environmental Audit Committee. “It should provide greater clarity on how it intends to deliver the Clean Growth Strategy by the 2018 Budget, and explore how a sovereign green bond could kickstart its Clean Growth Strategy,” she added.

2018-05-16,"* Open interest for coal futures contracts highest since Feb. 5 * Weak hydro output boosted outlook for coal demand * Power plants need more coal inventory for upcoming summer - analysts * Coal futures hit 6-week highs on Wednesday By Meng Meng and Josephine Mason BEIJING, May 16 (Reuters) - China’s thermal coal futures rose to a six-week high on Wednesday as traders bet on a supply crunch as lower hydro power output and forecasts of a summer heat wave spurred expectations of rising demand for the nation’s most-consumed fuel source. The most-active futures, for September delivery, on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange rose by as much as 1.9 percent to 643 yuan ($100.98) per tonne on Wednesday, their highest since Feb. 28. They have rallied 16 percent since mid-April. Demand has risen as coal-fired power plants will need to shore up inventory over the coming weeks as households in the southern provinces of Anhui and Fujian and in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai crank up air conditioners due to warmer-than-usual spring temperatures. “Tightness in the coal market is coming back. In northern China, anti-pollution campaign have curbed production and shortages has emerged in parts of southern China,” a Zhengzhou-based thermal-coal futures trader said. Demand across Asia, including China, has also boosted the price for coal from Australia’s Newcastle port, the regional benchmark, to over $105 a tonne, the highest in five years for this time of year. Temperatures in the city of Fuzhou in Fujian province and Shanghai rose to a higher-than-normal 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit) this week. Weather data on Thomson Reuters Eikon forecasts China’s largest cities, Beijing and Shanghai, will experience a hotter-than-usual summer this year. Reflecting the jump in bullish bets, open interest, a measure of liquidity, has risen since mid-April to over 402,292 lots, equivalent to 40.2 million tonnes of coal, on Monday, the highest since Feb. 5. Higher coal prices would crimp profits at China’s utilities that have already struggled with rising prices over the past two years as government-enforced mining cuts have limited supply. Rising coal demand runs counter to Beijing’s long-stated aim to boost renewable power consumption to reduce air pollution. Coal accounts for two-thirds of China’s power generation. Wang Fei, a coal analyst with Hua’an Futures, predicted coal futures could rise to as high as 690 yuan ($108.36) per tonne in June, surpassing the record of 680 yuan in January, as utilities shore up supplies before the peak summer demand period. The six largest coal power plants on the coast had 19 days of inventory by May 11, down from more than 20 days around the same period last year, data provided by Hua’an Futures showed. “Utilities started stockpiling earlier than usual this year, but it is not enough. The pace of stockpiling will accelerate in late May as power plants bring their inventory to a relative high level before summer,” Wang said. Plants are also restocking as concerns grow about a customs crackdown on imports in the eastern provinces of Zhejiang, Guangxi and Fujian, which have limited arrivals of foreign coal. Adding to concerns about the early heat wave are low reservoir levels, limiting hydro power output. Data on Tuesday showed that volumes at major reservoirs have fallen for six consecutive months since December and are at their lowest since August. Reservoir levels are a key gauge of how much electricity can be produced by hydro power stations. “We are closely watching if hydro power is enough to support overall power generation,” said the Zhengzhou-based trader. Hydro power output fell to 65.05 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) in March, the second-lowest ever for data going back for three years, and rebounded to only 70.2 billion kWh in April.

2018-05-16,"* Traders see western shipments to Asia around 1.1 mln T in June * Lower imports could stoke profits at Asian naphtha refiners * Asia is structurally short of naphtha, relies on imports * But lower gasoline prices could sap bull-run in naphtha prices By Seng Li Peng SINGAPORE, May 16 (Reuters) - Western naphtha shipments to Asia are likely to hit their lowest in three months in June at around 1.1 million tonnes, crimped by refinery maintenance in Europe, traders said on Wednesday. The third-straight monthly decline in western supply would come amid strong demand in Asia, with the region’s naphtha refining profits NAF-SIN-CRK, known as cracks, this week hitting their highest seasonal level since 2015 at almost $100 per tonne. Asia is structurally short of naphtha, a feedstock used to make plastics and other petrochemical products, and is dependent on the West and the Middle East to fill the gap. Although there remains time to book western cargoes for June to Asia, volumes were not expected to increase by much. “We have been seeing this amount of 1.1 million in the last two to three weeks and it could stay at that level,” said a Singapore-based trader at a company that regularly deals in naphtha. He declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media. The monthly average for January-May arrivals stands around 1.36 million tonnes. The trader added that Asia could need around 1 million tonnes of open-specification naphtha in June, but most of the barrels coming in were heavier grades. Traders had expected high prices for crude oil, used as a feedstock for making naphtha, to curb appetite for naphtha, but demand has remained robust. “Still-strong economic growth means that petrochemical players have been able to pass higher feedstock costs for naphtha down the value chain, and this factor should continue to offset the effect of higher underlying crude prices overall,” said Michael Dei-Michei, head of research at consulting firm JBC Energy. Crude prices hit their highest levels since late 2014 this month as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has been withholding supplies since 2017 to push up prices and as the United States has announced new sanctions against major crude exporter Iran. Supplies from the Middle East have also been slow, the Thomson Reuters Oil Research team said a weekly report. May shipments from the Middle East at up to 2.7 million tonnes were below the 2017 monthly average of 2.9 million tonnes, according to the report. The effects of a tight market have sent spot premiums for Indian cargoes of naphtha to a three-year high at more than $29 a tonne over Middle East quotes on a free-on-board (FOB) basis. However, any weakness in gasoline markets could sap the recent bull-run in prices for naphtha, which can also be used as a blending component for the fuel. “Should seasonal gasoline strength into the summer fail to materialise, then that would be a good reason for more naphtha to price out of the gasoline pool, causing renewed weakness in cracks,” said Dei-Michei. Since the start of the year, Asian gasoline has largely been in a contango structure, where front-month prices are lower than those for later delivery, implying oversupply. Reporting by Seng Li Peng

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.1 percent as Pyongyang’s move appeared to mark a break in months of warming ties between North and South Korea and with Washington. European shares looked set to open flat to marginally higher on Wednesday and U.S. S&P futures were little changed. Financial spread-betters expect London’s FTSE to open 3 points higher at 7,725, Frankfurt’s DAX to open 19 points higher at 12,989 and Paris’ CAC to open unchanged at 5,533. A cancellation of the June 12 summit in Singapore could see tensions on the Korean peninsula flare again as investors worry about China-U.S. trade tensions and the sustainability of global economic growth. “This will weigh on the Korean reconstruction beneficiaries that have had a strong run on peace and even reunification hopes recently,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note. “The broader risk for the region if talks do break down is that Trump no longer feels the need to keep China on side and could escalate trade tensions again.” Strong U.S. retail sales and factory data on Tuesday pushed the U.S. 10-year yield through a key level to hit 3.095 percent, its highest since July 2011, raising worries about higher borrowing costs for companies worldwide. The 10-year yield was last at 3.071 percent. The rise in yields hurt U.S. share markets on concerns it would undercut stock valuations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 193.00 points, or 0.78 percent, to 24,706.41, the S&P 500 lost 18.68 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,711.45 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 59.69 points, or 0.81 percent, to 7,351.63. Elsewhere in Asia, Japan’s Nikkei slid 0.4 percent, while South Korea’s KOSPI struggled for traction. Stocks in China dipped 0.3 percent as traders awaited news from a second round of Sino-U.S. trade talks in Washington this week, with both sides believed to be still far apart. But Australian stocks bucked the trend and advanced 0.2 percent. The strong U.S. data underpinned the dollar in currency markets. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, hit a 2018 high of 93.46 on Tuesday and last stood at 93.22. The euro fell to as low as $1.1814, its lowest level in five months. The dollar held firm at 110.24 yen having hit a near four-month high of 110.45 yen on Tuesday. The yen largely shrugged off data that showed Japan’s economy shrank more than expected in the January-March quarter. “U.S. retail data assured that the world is still in a synchronised global growth. If U.S. retail had been a disappointment, the market would have taken Japan’s GDP more negatively,” said Tohru Yamamoto, chief fixed income strategist at Daiwa Securities. High-yielding Asian currencies were particularly vulnerable to higher U.S. yields, which could prompt investors to shift funds out of emerging markets. The Indonesian rupiah hit a 2-1/2-year low while the Malaysian ringgit hit a four-month low. The Indian rupee unexpectedly gained 0.5 percent on suspected currency market intervention by the central bank after hitting a 16-month closing low of 68.15 per dollar on Tuesday. The South Korean won was steadier but the country’s bond yields rose to the highest level since late 2014. Some market participants think emerging market assets would be better placed than they were in the past, when hints the U.S. Fed would taper its quantitative easing knocked their prices. “What we see today is a reallocation to the U.S. because of a strong U.S. economy. I don’t expect panic selling in emerging markets for now,” said Daiwa’s Yamamoto. He also said he does not see the U.S. 10-year yield rising further towards 3.5 percent given the Fed’s estimate of neutral U.S. interest rates is much lower. San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams, who is about to assume a vice chairmanship as head of the New York Fed, said on Tuesday that the neutral rate remained around 2.5 percent. In commodities markets, gold slightly rebounded after hitting a 4 1/2-month low the previous day on a strong dollar. It stood at $1,294 per ounce, off Tuesday’s low of $1,289.30. Crude oil prices remained near recent highs amid concerns U.S. sanctions on Iran may restrict crude exports from a major producer. U.S. light crude was 0.4 percent lower at $71.06 after reaching $71.92 on Tuesday, its highest level since November 2014. Brent crude oil traded at $78.21 a barrel, down 0.3 percent. On Tuesday, it reached an intraday peak of $79.47 a barrel, its highest since November 2014.

2018-05-16," ADELAIDE (Reuters) - Liquefied natural gas (LNG) producers around the globe are once again considering new investments as expectations of a glut in supply wither away in the face of strong, China-led demand growth in Asia. Given it takes several years to go from a Final Investment Decision (FID) to producing cargoes of the super-chilled fuel, however, the industry may be acting too late to prevent a supply shortfall by the middle of next decade. Much of the focus this week at an annual oil and gas conference in Australia - which is about to become the world’s top exporter of LNG - was on what projects are viable and how quickly can they be developed. This was in stark contrast to the mood at previous events hosted by the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA), where executives had talked mainly about how to cut costs and the strategies needed to survive the predicted surplus of the fuel. The forecasts for a global glut were based on the market being swamped by eight new Australian LNG projects, plus at least four in the United States, as well a handful of others in frontier countries such as Mozambique. But the narrative of industry over-investment in capacity has been turned on its head by the spectacular growth of Chinese demand, which leapt 46 percent last year to 38.1 million tonnes. China is now the world’s second-biggest LNG buyer, behind Japan, and its demand has continued to grow rapidly, with first-quarter imports up 59 percent from a year ago to 12.4 million tonnes. China’s policy to replace coal with natural gas for uses such as residential heating and some industries is expected to continue to drive growth in LNG imports, although some moderation in the rate is likely in coming years. But other Asian countries are also stepping up LNG imports, including new buyers such as Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.  (GRAPHIC: Asia leads global LNG demand: tmsnrt.rs/2HfLB0b)  At the height of the LNG construction boom of the past decade, forecasts of a surplus of as much as 50 million tonnes per annum around the start of the 2020s were not uncommon. While a surplus is still expected by most analysts, size estimates have been shrinking, and if China continues to grow demand at anything like its current pace, the surplus will likely disappear altogether. Wood Mackenzie analysts Saul Kavonic and Nicholas Browne, speaking on Tuesday on the sidelines of the APPEA conference, said the surplus was likely to be as little as 10 million tonnes in the early years of the 2020s. In a total market of more than 350 million tonnes a year, such a small surplus really amounts to a market that is more or less in balance. Kavonic and Browne also said that by 2025 the market was likely to switch to an annual deficit of about 50 million tonnes, and there simply aren’t enough projects being approved to meet the potential supply gap. In 2017, just one LNG project reached FID, that being the relatively small Coral floating LNG development in Mozambique. There is also a dearth of shovel-ready projects that can be approved and developed in time for 2025, with the best prospects in the United States, Canada and East Africa. In Australia, the likelihood of a new greenfield development is slim, given the massive capital costs of developing increasingly remote fields. There is instead the possibility of expanding existing operations, with the likely best bet being Woodside Petroleum’s plan to use the Scarborough field off the Western Australian coast to feed a new train at its Pluto LNG plant. For the rest of Australia, the industry seems to be concentrating on developing new fields to replace ones that are depleting, thus allowing the existing 80 million tonnes of capacity to continue operating. The evaporation of the expected LNG surplus may also have implications for pricing and contracting in the industry. LNG buyers have led the charge in recent years to end long-term, restrictive contracts linked to crude oil prices in favour of shorter-term or even spot deals with prices linked to LNG indexes or other natural gas prices, such as the U.S. benchmark Henry Hub. The buyers did this because they believed the balance of market power was shifting in their favour. They may now find resurgent producers kicking them back and demanding higher prices in order to guarantee supplies.

2018-05-16,"SEATTLE, May 15 (Reuters) - Mexican state-run oil company Pemex expects to begin testing light crudes as soon as July for possible import, looking to boost margins at its domestic refineries, its chief executive said on Tuesday. Pemex has for decades exported crude oil but has hardly ever imported the commodity, preferring to process domestic crudes at its six refineries in Mexico. Pemex Chief Executive Officer Carlos Trevino said the company would likely seek imports resembling its proprietary Isthmus grade of light crude, the production of which has been declining in Mexico. “We are going to start testing maybe in the third quarter,” Trevino told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Seattle. “We are going to be looking for the cheaper mix ... We may be using the (West Texas Intermediate), something from the U.S., he said. “What I personally expect is that we can find something very similar (to Isthmus).” The company, one of the largest in Latin America, has said it was looking for lighter crude grades for its refining network, which is currently operating at around 48 percent of its 1.54 million barrel-per-day capacity. Trevino reiterated that importing could be a temporary strategy, partly because of the oil it has been producing at its new Ixachi field in Veracruz. “It’s a lot of gas and very, very light crude so we expect to get more oil from that field, so maybe that will help us on the mix we are using for our refineries,” he said. Trevino also said Pemex’s annual crude oil hedging program is set to cover about a third of annual production at a price of $51 per barrel, but he declined to elaborate. The company was processing between 813,000-820,000 bpd as of Sunday, but expects to process an average 850,000 bpd for the rest of the year. Pemex has increased processing levels at its Madero refinery and expects to “finish the starting up” of its Minatitlan facility this month, Trevino said. It may begin maintenance at its Cadereyta and Tula refineries later this year. “We are going to be (processing) around 800,000 bpd at the end of the year,” he added. Trevino also said he expects Pemex’s rate of replacement for its proven oil reserves in 2018 to be “pretty much the same or a little above” the 17.5-percent rate it achieved in 2017.

2018-05-16,"(Adds quotes from spokesman, background, details) OTTAWA, May 15 (Reuters) - Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau will brief reporters on Wednesday about talks with Kinder Morgan Canada on possible aid for an oil pipeline project but will not be announcing a final decision, a spokesman said on Tuesday. Ottawa says it is prepared to offer financial support to ensure the company proceeds with a planned expansion of its Trans Mountain line from oil sands projects in the province of Alberta to British Columbia on the Pacific coast. Kinder Morgan halted work last month, citing resistance from the British Columbia government, and said it would scrap the project if it did not receive the certainty it needs by May 31. Morneau is due to speak at 9 a.m. EDT (1300 GMT) on Wednesday, the same day Kinder Morgan Canada holds its annual general meeting in Calgary, Alberta. “We are going to update on ongoing discussions. It’s not the final deal, it’s not anything like that,” Morneau’s spokesman Dan Lauzon said by phone, saying the discussions had been difficult at some points. Morneau, he added, would outline what solutions the federal government could explore. Sources have previously said Ottawa is examining options such as loan guarantees, a bailout, or taking a stake in the C$7.4 billion ($5.8 billion) project. The development is supported by Canadian oil producers, who receive lower prices for their crude oil because of the lack of transportation capacity to take it to end-users. However, the pipeline is opposed by British Columbia as well as some aboriginal groups and environmental activists, who cite the risk of spills. $1 = 1.2862 Canadian dollars

2018-05-16,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil producer ConocoPhillips (COP.N) is far from collecting the full value of a $2 billion (1.5 billion pounds) arbitration award against Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL], Conoco’s chief executive said on Tuesday. Conoco has won court orders allowing the company to begin seizing PDVSA assets in efforts to collect on an award by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) over the 2007 nationalisation of its projects in Venezuela. While Conoco started seizing assets this month, Chief Executive Officer Ryan Lance is telegraphing that the company intends to escalate its campaign against PDVSA across the globe as it works to recoup losses. That threatens to further limit revenue at the state-controlled firm, the single largest moneymaker for the OPEC member. “It’s not close to the $2 billion today, but over time we expect to be able to recover it,” Lance said at Conoco’s annual shareholder meeting in Houston. “We’re just trying to look where all the assets are.”  Conoco has filed with courts in the United States, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom and throughout the Caribbean in an attempt to begin the legal process of seizing additional PDVSA assets, Lance said. Conoco on Tuesday moved to seize at least two cargoes of crude and fuel near a terminal operated by PDVSA subsidiary Citgo Petroleum in Aruba, sources told Reuters.  In Asia, PDVSA is co-owner with PetroChina (601857.SS) of CV Shipping Pte Ltd, a Singapore-based tanker operator, according to CV Shipping’s website. The joint venture has four tankers, each capable of transporting 2 million barrels of oil. In Europe, PDVSA is a co-owner with Finland’s Neste Corp of AB Nynas Petroleum, according to PDVSA’s website. The joint venture, which processes about 30,000 barrels of crude per day, operates two United Kingdom refineries. Conoco has had early success in asset seizures in some Dutch regions of the Caribbean due to specific legal statutes, though other jurisdictions are expected to take longer, Lance said. The moves have disrupted fuel deliveries throughout the Caribbean, much of which depend on PDVSA. Aruba’s prime minister, Evelyn Wever-Croes, told journalists on Tuesday that the situation with Conoco in the Caribbean is worrisome.  “We’re trying to minimize any impact that this might have on the islands in the Caribbean,” Lance said. “We are concerned about putting them in the middle of this thing, between PDVSA and ourselves.” Three Curacao state-run utilities said on Tuesday they were filing suit in a local court to determine the responsibility of the local Isla refinery, operated by PDVSA, to meet fuel supply contracts following Conoco’s efforts to attach assets there. The utilities, which include power and water company Aqualectra and fuel distributor Curoil, said a lack of fuel could have a severe impact on their operations and therefore on the local population. PDVSA, which operates Isla, has stopped sending crude shipments on concern they could be attached. Houston-based Conoco has two other outstanding arbitration awards against PDVSA.

2018-05-16,"(Repeats story from Tuesday with no changes to text) * Noble seeks $3.4 bln debt restructuring to survive * Dissident shareholder files lawsuit to prevent deal * Market value falls from more than $11 bln to just $80 mln By Anshuman Daga and Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, May 15 (Reuters) - Just seven years ago, Noble Group was an $11 billion-plus Asian commodity powerhouse, trading everything from soybeans to oil. Now it’s worth barely $80 million, rooted among Singapore’s penny stocks. Noble has posted huge losses provoked by a lack of trade financing and market calls that went sour, while also whittling down a mountain of debt. On Tuesday, it reported a narrower first-quarter loss than a year ago, although saying its performance was still beset by constraints on liquidity and trade finance. Shareholder meetings and legal rulings over the next few weeks will decide whether it survives. Amid accusations of false accounting levelled in 2015 by Iceberg Research, and a legal spat this year, a long slide in investor confidence has seen most of Noble’s market value wiped out. Noble has defended its accounting and is now trying to clinch a last-ditch deal with creditors and shareholders from which - if it succeeds - it will emerge a transformed company. Noble is seeking approval to halve its $3.4 billion debt in return for handing over 70 percent of equity to senior creditors, mostly a group of hedge funds which calls itself the “Ad Hoc Group”. Under that plan, its headquarters will be in London, not Asia, no longer controlled by founder Richard Elman. The deal would leave existing shareholders with just 15 percent equity in a company that has seen its share price fall from a peak of S$17.6 Singapore dollar ($13.18) in 2011 to below S$0.1. Despite its woes, Noble has so far defied talk of its demise. But to keep going, Noble needs a majority of its shareholders to approve the restructuring - a vote on the proposal is expected in June. Scared by the prospect of total loss and lack of any alternate plan, the proposal could get enough support, company sources say. Founder Elman, still Noble’s biggest shareholder with a stake of nearly 18 percent, would be given a board seat in the new firm. Noble chairman Paul Brough, a restructuring and liquidation expert, has urged shareholders to support the deal, threatening a failure would result in insolvency and bankruptcy. But leading the resistance is Abu Dhabi-based Goldilocks Investment Co. Ltd, which holds 8.1 percent in Noble. Goldilocks has filed complaints and lawsuits against the restructuring plans, arguing they protect creditors at the expense of shareholders. Goldilocks is Noble’s third-biggest shareholder after Elman and China Investment Corp, which has a 9.5 percent stake. It’s not just shareholders who are unhappy, though. One of Noble’s business partners, Indonesian coal miner PT Atlas Resources, has also filed lawsuit against Noble and its chief executive William James Randall, alleging it was given false information related to asset sales. Shipping Indonesian coal to buyers in Asia is the biggest remaining business at Noble, which has said it plans to resist any and all allegations or claims made against it. In its glory days, Noble employed hundreds of traders, with ambitions to rival global rivals like Glencore. But with its market value a shadow of what it once was, and billions in debt, Noble has struggled to remain active. Instead of trading itself out of trouble, it was forced to sell off its core businesses, including oil and gas, to competitors Vitol and Mercuria. This, as well as some bad trading calls, meant Noble booked a whopping $5 billion loss in 2017 - despite a broad commodity market recovery. As a result, Noble was unable to join a share-price rally enjoyed by rival miners and traders like Glencore or Whitehaven Coal. For now, Noble fights on, seeking to make the best of its new look. Earlier in May, its gave a market presentation at a major coal trading event in Bali at which it described itself as “small, but nimble and motivated”.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.1 percent. Strong U.S. retail and factory data on Tuesday pushed the U.S. 10-year yield through a key level to hit 3.095, its highest since July 2011. The rise in yields hurt U.S. share markets on concerns it would undercut stock valuations. Asian shares are under pressure after North Korea cancelled high-level talks with Seoul, denouncing military exercises between South Korea and the United States, breaking from several months of easing relations on the peninsula. This has also raised concerns about the planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and his North Korean counterpart leader Kim Jong Un scheduled next month “This will weigh on the Korean reconstruction beneficiaries that have had a strong run on peace and even reunification hopes recently,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note. “The broader risk for the region if talks do break down is that Trump no longer feels the need to keep China on side and could escalate trade tensions again.” South Korea’s KOSPI was 0.4 percent lower, Japan’s Nikkei was down 0.3 percent and Australian stocks edged up 0.1 percent. New Zealand’s S&P/NZX 50 index was down around 1.4 percent after earlier falling as much as 2.3 percent, after dairy company A2 Milk Ltd’s revenue guidance fell short of analyst expectations, knocking the shares to a three-month low. In the United States, stronger growth and the potential for steadily rising inflation have added to expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve may move to increase interest rates at a faster pace. The 10-year yield was last at 3.0686 percent. The two-year yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, hit 2.5890 percent on Tuesday, its highest level since August 2008, and was last at 2.5766 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 193.00 points, or 0.78 percent, to 24,706.41, the S&P 500 lost 18.68 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,711.45 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 59.69 points, or 0.81 percent, to 7,351.63. In energy markets, crude oil prices remained near recent highs amid concerns U.S. sanctions on Iran may restrict crude exports from a major producer. U.S. light crude was 0.6 percent lower at $70.92 after reaching $71.92 on Tuesday, its highest level since November 2014. Brent crude oil settled at $78.43 a barrel, up 20 cents, or 0.3 percent. It earlier reached an intraday peak of $79.47 a barrel, up $1.24 and its highest since November 2014. The dollar was mostly flat against the yen at 110.29 . The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was up 0.05 percent at 93.270. On Tuesday, the index had hit its highest level this year, lifted by the 10-year yield. In commodities markets, gold was slightly higher, with spot gold trading at $1293.11 per ounce.

2018-05-16,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Venezuela’s state-run oil firm PDVSA has bought nearly $440 million (£326 million) worth of foreign crude and shipped it directly to Cuba on friendly credit terms - and often at a loss, according to internal company documents reviewed by Reuters. The shipments are the first documented instances of the OPEC nation buying crude to supply regional allies instead of selling them oil from its own vast reserves. Venezuela made the discounted deliveries, which have not been previously reported, despite its dire need for foreign currency to bolster its collapsing economy and to import food and medicine amid widespread shortages. The open-market oil purchases to subsidise one of Venezuela’s few remaining allies underscores its increasing global isolation and the disintegration of its energy sector under socialist President Nicolas Maduro. The purchases came as Venezuela’s crude production hit a 33-year low in the first quarter - down 28 percent in 12 months. Its refineries are operating at a third of capacity, and its workers are resigning by the thousands. (For a graphic on Venezuela's rising oil imports and falling exports, see: tmsnrt.rs/2wHCTUF ) PDVSA bought the crude for up to $12 per barrel more than it priced the same oil when it shipped to Cuba, according to prices on internal documents reviewed by Reuters. But Cuba may never pay cash for the cargoes because Venezuela has long accepted goods and services from Cuba in return for oil under a pact signed in 2000 by late presidents Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro. PDVSA, the Venezuela government and the Cuba government did not respond to requests for comment. Venezuela’s government has previously said it only imports oil to blend with its own tar-like crude to improve quality and create an exportable product, or to feed its refinery in Curacao. But hundreds of PDSVA documents examined by Reuters detailing imports and exports, dated from January 2017 to May of this year, show the company is now buying crude at market prices to deliver to allies - in shipments that never pass through Venezuela. The subsidized deliveries are aimed at maintaining political support from Cuba, one of a dwindling group of Venezuela allies, according to diplomats, politicians and PDVSA executives. “Maduro is giving away everything he can because these countries’ backing, especially from Cuba, is all the political support he has left,” said a former top Venezuelan government official who declined to be identified. Late Tuesday, a leader of the political opposition to Maduro, Henrique Capriles, reacted to Reuters’ disclosure of the oil shipments to Cuba by tweeting: “Venezuelans are suffering the worst crisis without food or medicine, our oil is about to be seized due to PDVSA’s debts, and they continue irresponsibly buying oil to give it away to other countries. They don’t care!” Caracas has come under increasing international pressure as the United States, the European Union and Canada have sanctioned Venezuela for what they see as Maduro’s attempts to cement a dictatorship. As Venezuela spends on oil imports, it has imported less of everything else its citizens desperately need. Venezuela’s spending on non-oil imports plunged from nearly $46 billion in 2011 to $6 billion in 2017, according Venezuela Central Bank data and Ecoanalitica, a Caracas-based economic research organisation. The oil PDVSA procured for Cuba was Russian Urals crude, the documents show, a variety well-suited for Cuban refineries constructed from Soviet-era equipment. PDVSA bought the crude from Chinese, Russian and Swiss firms – not for cash, but a pledge that PDVSA would deliver other oil shipments later, the documents show. That adds to Venezuela’s already towering debts of oil to state-owned firms in Russia and China, which together have extended Venezuela’s government more than $60 billion in oil-for-loan deals that have propped up its budget amid declining exports and lower oil prices. “It’s nonsense to import oil to keep subsidized exports flowing,” said Ecoanalitica President Asdrubal Oliveros. PETRO-DIPLOMACY Venezuela’s socialist government has long used oil for domestic and international political ends, subsidizing goods and services at home and currying favour across the region with oil deliveries on generous terms. Venezuela’s oil supply arrangements have helped soften international political censure of Maduro’s government. The Organization of American States (OAS), which includes most Western Hemisphere nations, last year took up a motion seeking to pressure Venezuela to hold free elections, liberate political prisoners and declare a humanitarian crisis. The effort was defeated when 12 countries that have received regular oil shipments from Venezuela in recent years - about a third of the OAS membership - opposed it or refused to vote. Eventually, the OAS passed a watered-down motion urging free and fair elections. Venezuela has avoided formal OAS condemnation “thanks to the support of the bloc of Caribbean nations that have benefited from its subsidized oil and development programs for years,” said Michael Fitzpatrick, deputy assistant secretary in the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said on April 30 during a talk at the Atlantic Council, a foreign policy think tank in Washington. Most of those countries are members of Venezuela’s Petrocaribe trade pact, launched in 2005, which has granted up to 16 Caribbean and Central American states with oil supplies on favourable terms. OAS President Luis Almagro declined to comment through press office representative Monica Reyes. El Salvador’s Economy Minister, Luz Estrella Rodriguez, said Petrocaribe and other pacts promoted by Venezuela had played an important role in her country’s development. “Our country is very grateful,” she said. “The government of El Salvador, of course, is a friend and an ally of the Venezuelan government.” El Salvador refused to vote last year on the OAS motion to condemn Venezuela. Venezuela also supplied fuel last year to Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Dominica, the documents show. In total, members of oil trade pacts with Venezuela last year received at least 103,000 bpd of crude and refined products from PDVSA, the documents show, or about 6 percent of Venezuela’s exports. The falling output of Venezuela’s refineries has also left the country increasingly dependent on fuel imports to meet domestic consumption. The internal PDVSA data reviewed by Reuters shows Venezuela last year purchased some 180,000 barrels per day of foreign crude and refined products from PetroChina, Rosneft, Lukoil, Reliance Industries and other suppliers, 17 percent more than in 2016.  Those companies did not respond to requests for comment. The purchases totalled more $4 billion, according to PDVSA records. Last year, total oil-industry purchases, including equipment and services, consumed 45 percent of Venezuela’s total import spending, up from 13 percent in 2011, Ecoanalitica data shows. Energy imports totalled $5.4 billion out of $11.9 billion. The resulting scarcity of food, medicine and employment has caused thousands of citizens to flee Venezuela. The pay of PDVSA workers now can’t cover the barest essentials because of the collapse of its currency, the bolivar. “A worker’s salary is not even enough for a box of eggs,” said Hector Bertis, a PDVSA worker and union leader. “We go to the bank, and they give us 10,000 bolivars - less than what a transportation fare costs.” Reporting by Marianna Parraga in Houston and Jeanne Liendo in Calgary; additional reporting by Alexandra Ulmer in Washington, Paula Rosales in San Salvador, Gary McWilliams in Houston and Mircely Guanipa in Punto Fijo; Editing by Gary McWilliams, Simon Webb and Brian Thevenot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-oil-imports/update-1-exclusive-as-venezuelans-suffer-maduro-buys-foreign-oil-to-subsidize-cuba-idUKL2N1SM2J9,16 May 2018,"Venezuela's state-run oil firm

2018-05-16,"(Repeats May 15 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chart: tmsnrt.rs/2rG6GIs By John Kemp LONDON, May 15 (Reuters) - U.S. net petroleum imports have fallen to the lowest level in more than half a century as a result of the shale revolution, which is profoundly changing the impact higher oil prices have on the economy. Since the 1860s, the United States has been the world’s largest producer and consumer of oil, which means it has a complicated relationship with oil prices. Rising oil prices benefit some businesses and workers at the expense of others, and the same has been true about a sharp price fall. Until after World War Two, the country was a net exporter to the rest of the world, the first era of U.S. energy dominance. But from the late 1940s and especially the 1950s, the United States turned into an increasingly major oil importer. Since then, the principal effect of a rise in oil prices has been to transfer income from consumers and businesses in the United States to oil-producing countries in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. Rising prices have put pressure on the U.S. balance of payments and the dollar’s value, contributing to an occasionally negative relationship between the price of oil and the exchange rate. But as net imports have declined in the last decade, the picture has changed again, and the main transfers of income are now occurring within the United States rather than with the rest of the world. The impact of oil prices on the U.S. trade deficit and the exchange rate is becoming much less significant than before. Instead, rising prices are transferring income from net consuming states such as California, Florida, New York and Illinois to net producing states including Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and North Dakota. Rising prices are also transferring income from households, motorists, the transportation sector, manufacturers and retailers to the oil industry and its supply chain. In the broadest sense, rising oil prices tend to depress spending by consumers while enhancing investment by the oil industry (“How rising oil prices will affect the United States”, Barron’s, May 11). In the short term, rising oil prices have provided a significant boost to the economic expansion as the positive impact on investment has outweighed the negative impact on consumer spending. But that positive scenario may not last if oil prices continue to rise over the next two years. Domestic crude production has more than doubled from an average of 5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2008 to 10.3 million bpd in February 2018. Government policies have also cut import dependence by requiring increases in vehicle fuel economy and mandating the addition of ethanol and biodiesel to the fuel supply. Domestic consumption of petroleum products peaked at 20.8 million bpd in 2005 and was averaging 19.9 million bpd in 2017. The result has been a transformation in U.S. petroleum trade, with the country becoming an increasingly important exporter of refined products, such as diesel, and more recently crude oil. The size and suddenness of this shift is one reason why the rise of shale production in the United States qualifies as a genuine energy revolution. Net imports of crude oil and petroleum products peaked at more than 12.5 million bpd in 2005, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. By 2017, net imports had fallen to 3.7 million bpd and they continued to shrink in the first three months of 2018 (tmsnrt.rs/2rG6GIs). The United States remains an important net importer of crude (roughly 6 million bpd in recent months) but has become an important net exporter of refined products (3 million bpd). The balance of payments is now much more insulated from the impact of changing oil prices than during the 2008 oil shock. Between January and March 2018, the U.S. trade deficit with the rest of the world worsened by almost $23 billion compared with a year earlier. The non-petroleum components of the deficit worsened by $26 billion but the petroleum deficit actually improved by almost $4 billion (“International Trade in Goods and Services”, Census Bureau, May 2018). The rise in U.S. oil production has encouraged some policymakers to speak about achieving energy independence or even a second era of energy dominance. The reality is more complicated. Increased domestic energy production is clearly beneficial for the economy. But sharp increases or reductions in oil prices can still have profound distributional effects within the United States. Since capital and labour do not move without friction between industries and states, sudden income redistribution can still have an adverse impact on the overall performance of the economy. The oil slump between 2014 and 2016 deepened the overall slowdown in business investment and contributed to a soft patch in overall economic growth, which initially overshadowed the gains for consumers. The rise in prices since 2016 is now contributing to an acceleration of business investment and activity in the oil and gas sector and all along the supply chain, helping boost the overall economic expansion. Mining, which includes oil and gas production, was the fastest-growing sector of the U.S. economy in 2017 (“Gross domestic product by industry: fourth quarter and annual 2017”, Bureau of Economic Analysis, April 2018). Rising oil prices are one reason the economies of some major oil-producing states outperformed the rest of the country towards the end of 2017. Texas was the fastest-growing state economy in the country in the final three months of 2017 (“Gross domestic product by state: fourth quarter and annual 2017”, Bureau of Economic Analysis, May 2018). But beyond a certain point, rising oil prices will start to weigh on investment and spending by the non-oil sector and households, retarding overall growth. Moreover, the United States remains embedded in a dense web of international trading relationships with petroleum producing and consuming countries. Higher oil prices tend to improve the opportunities for U.S. exports and outward investment in petroleum-exporting countries in the Middle East and other regions. But they also tend to curb export growth to petroleum-importing countries, notably China, India, Japan and in Europe, which include some of the country’s most important trading partners.

2018-05-16,"* U.S. crude stocks rise by 4.9 mln bbl to 435.6 mln bbl -API * Physical spot cargoes trade at discount to financial crude By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, May 16 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday, weighed down by ample supplies despite ongoing output cuts by producer cartel OPEC and looming U.S. sanctions against major crude exporter Iran. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $78.07 per barrel at 0024 GMT, down 36 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $71.02 a barrel, down 28 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last settlement. Despite the dips, both financial oil benchmarks remained close to their November 2014 highs of $79.47 and $71.92 a barrel respectively, reached the previous day. But there are signs in physical crude markets that may give pause to financial investors. Spot crude oil cargo prices are at their steepest discounts to futures prices in years as sellers are struggling to find buyers for West African, Russian and Kazakh cargoes, while pipeline bottlenecks trap supply in west Texas and Canada. The bottleneck in North America likely contributed to a 4.9 million barrel rise in U.S. crude oil inventories, to 435.6 million barrels, that the American Petroleum Institute reported on Tuesday. “The API inventory data in the U.S. fits with ... a topping pattern – or at least a decent pause – for oil prices at the moment,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader. Despite Wednesday’s dips and some indicators implying the financial oil has overshot physical oil, overall crude market conditions have tightened since 2017 when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia, started to withhold supplies to push up oil prices. With renewed U.S. sanctions looming against OPEC-member Iran and oil demand strong, analysts said crude markets will likely remain relatively tight for much of the year. Stronger oil prices are also spilling into other markets. “A rising oil price brings upside price risk to all commodities,” Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients this week. The U.S. bank said rising diesel prices contributed 10-20 percent to cash costs in the metals and dry-bulk sectors, while the price of oil also significantly contributed to power generation. “Finally, transport costs (5-20 percent of cash costs) will also rise in response, with the heaviest impact on bulk commodity producers,” Morgan Stanley said.

2018-05-16,"(Adds details on tanker cargoes seized) By Sailu Urribarri and Marianna Parraga May 15 (Reuters) - U.S. oil company ConocoPhillips has brought new court actions to seize two cargoes of crude and fuel near a terminal operated by PDVSA subsidiary Citgo Petroleum in Aruba, the Aruban government confirmed on Tuesday. Conoco is moving aggressively to enforce a $2 billion arbitration award over the 2007 expropriation of two oil projects in Venezuela, creating unease in the Caribbean, where many islands depend on fuel produced by state-run PDVSA . “The Aruba refinery has said that an embargo on two Citgo oil cargoes was introduced last night. Citgo is claiming the crude as its own, and is fighting at court to demonstrate the product is not PDVSA’s,” said Prime Minister Evelyn Wever-Croes in a statement. “Independent of any outcome, this is not going to affect Aruba,” she said. The cargoes seized included 500,000 barrels of crude oil on the Grimstad and about 300,000 barrels of jet fuel, gasoline and diesel on the Atlantic Lily, according to a source at the Aruba terminal and Thomson Reuters vessel tracking data. Citgo, the U.S. refining unit of PDVSA, has leased the 209,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Aruba refinery and its 13 million-barrel terminal from the government since 2016 to store Venezuelan and other crudes for supplying its U.S. refineries. As the refinery remains idled since 2012 while a major refurbish project is underway, Citgo regularly supplies the island with imported fuel. Wever-Croes told journalists government officials and the management of the refinery were organizing a contingency plan to avoid a situation similar to Curacao and Bonaire, where inventories were blocked by Conoco’s legal actions. No fuel shortages have been reported in the Caribbean but officials are trying to import from other sources. Conoco in recent days seized the 10-million-barrel BOPEC oil terminal owned by PDVSA in Bonaire and fuel inventories at the 335,000-bpd Isla refinery operated by the Venezuelan firm in Curacao. Both islands are in talks with Conoco to free fuel for domestic consumption. “What belongs to Citgo belongs to PDVSA, but a judge has to rule on it,” Wever-Croes said. Daren Beaudo, a Conoco spokesman, said on Tuesday that the company sent representatives to the Caribbean this week to meet with local officials and address their concerns over Conoco’s efforts to enforce the arbitration award by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last week, Curacao officials said the Isla refinery would have to halt refining operations once its available inventories were exhausted. “It is PDVSA that has failed to honor our award by ignoring the judgement of the ICC tribunal and other local court orders,” Beaudo said in a statement. Conoco Chief Executive Ryan Lance on Tuesday said the firm is far from recovering all of the $2 billion ICC award. He said legal actions have been brought in Hong Kong and London to have the ruling recognized following a similar move last month in a New York court.
