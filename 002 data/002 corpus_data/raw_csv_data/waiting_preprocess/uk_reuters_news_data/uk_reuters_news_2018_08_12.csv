2018-08-12,"* Euro slips in early Asia as yen, Swiss franc, dollar bid * Stock futures point to opening losses across the region * Turkish lira hits lows before steadying on talk of govt action By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Aug 13 (Reuters) - The euro was under pressure in Asia on Monday as fears about the exposure of European banks to crisis-hit Turkey sent investors scurrying to safe havens including the U.S. dollar, Swiss franc and yen. Regional stocks also looked likely to suffer as Turkey’s troubles tainted emerging markets in general, while boosting highly rated sovereign bonds. Nikkei futures were pointing to an opening loss of around 200 points, while EMini futures for the S&P 500 were off 0.25 percent. Treasury futures were up a tick. Much of the early action was in currencies with the euro gapping lower as the Turkish lira took another slide to all-time lows around 7.2400. It was last at 6.7900, having found a sliver of support when Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said the country had drafted an action plan to ease investor concerns and the banking watchdog said it limited swap transactions. The currency tumbled more than 40 percent this year on worries over Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan’s increasing control over the economy and deteriorating relations with the United States. “The plunge in the lira which began in May now looks certain to push the Turkish economy into recession and it may well trigger a banking crisis,” said Andrew Kenningham, chief global economist at Capital Economics. “This would be another blow for EMs as an asset class, but the wider economic spillovers should be fairly modest, even for the euro zone,” he added. Kenningham noted Turkey’s annual gross domestic product of around $900 billion was just 1 percent of the global economy and slightly smaller than the Netherlands. The Turkish equity market was less than 2 percent of the size of the UK market, and only 20 percent was held by non-residents, he added. “Nonetheless, Turkey’s troubles are a further headwind for the euro and are not good news for EM assets either.” Indeed, the single currency sank to a one-year trough against the Swiss franc in early trade around 1.1300 francs, while hitting a 10-week low on the yen around 125.45 . Against the U.S. dollar, the euro touched its lowest since July 2017 at $1.13715. It was last at $1.1392 and still a long way from last week’s top at $1.1628. The dollar eased against the safe haven yen to 110.69. The Argentine peso and South African rand were also caught in the crossfire. “Contagion risks centre on Spanish, Italian and French banks exposed to Turkish foreign currency debt, as well as Argentina and South Africa,” warned analysts at ANZ. “Turkey’s massive pile of corporate debt denominated in foreign currencies, but a rapidly sliding currency – and inflation that’s threatening to go exponential – is a toxic combination.” In commodity markets, gold had found little in the way of safety flows and was last a shade firmer at $1,212.52 an ounce . Oil prices were mixed with Brent off 11 cents at $72.70 a barrel, while U.S. crude was flat at $67.63.

2018-08-12,"(Adds details) DUBAI, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco, Air Products and ACWA Power signed on Sunday an agreement outlining terms for setting up a gasification/power joint venture in Saudi Arabia with assets bought from the state energy giant. “The JV will purchase the gasification assets, power block and the associated utilities from Saudi Aramco for approximately $8 billion,” they said a statement. According to the term sheet, U.S.-based Air Products will own at least 55 percent of the joint venture, to be set up in Jazan Economic City (JEC), with Saudi Aramco and ACWA Power owning the balance, the statement said. The joint venture will own and operate the facility under a 25-year contract for a fixed monthly fee. Saudi Aramco will supply feedstock and the joint venture will produce power, hydrogen and other utilities for Aramco. The statement said the assets are currently under construction and would be transferred to the joint venture upon start-up, scheduled in 2019. “The JV will serve Saudi Aramco’s Jazan Refinery and terminal at JEC, a megaproject that will process heavy and medium crude oil to create liquefied petroleum gas, sulfur, asphalt, benzene and paraxylene, and add 400,000 barrels per day of refining capacity,” it added. The refinery on the Red Sea is part of a plan to revive the southwestern region by building an economic city which will help create thousands of jobs. Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), has a total shareholding of 25 percent in Riyadh-based ACWA Power, a developer and operator of power and water plants.

2018-08-12,"AKTAU, Kazakhstan (Reuters) - Iran and four ex-Soviet nations, including Russia, agreed in principle on Sunday how to divide up the potentially huge oil and gas resources of the Caspian Sea, paving way for more energy exploration and pipeline projects. However, the delimitation of the seabed - which has caused most disputes - will require additional agreements between littoral nations, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said. For almost three decades, the five littoral states - Russia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan - have argued over  how to divide the world’s biggest enclosed body of water. And while some countries have pressed ahead with large offshore projects such as the Kashagan oil field off Kazakhstan’s coast, disagreement over the sea’s legal status has prevented some other ideas from being implemented. One of those is a pipeline across the Caspian which could ship natural gas from Turkmenistan to Azerbaijan and then further to Europe, allowing it to compete with Russia in the Western markets. Some littoral states have also disputed the ownership of several oil and gas fields, which delayed their development. “We have established 15-mile-wide territorial waters whose borders become state borders,” Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev told a briefing after signing the Caspian convention. “Adjacent to the territorial waters are 10 miles of fishing water where each state has exclusive fishing rights,” he said. Nazarbayev also said the convention explicitly barred any armed presence on the Caspian Sea other than that of the littoral states. POST-SOVIET ISSUE The dispute began with the fall of the Soviet Union which had a clearly defined Caspian border with Iran. In negotiations with post-Soviet nations, Tehran has insisted on either splitting the sea into five equal parts or jointly developing all of its resources. None of its neighbours have agreed to those proposals and three of them - Russia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan - effectively split the northern Caspian between each other using median lines. Azerbaijan, however, has yet to agree on how to divide several oil and gas fields with Iran and Turkmenistan, including the Kapaz/Serdar field with reserves of some 620 million barrels of oil. The three countries have tried to develop the disputed fields while at times using warships to scare off contractors hired by other sides. As a result, none of the disputed projects has made much progress. Speaking after the signing on Sunday, all five leaders praised it as historic event, but provided little detail about provisions on splitting the seabed. However, making it clear that the document is no final solution, Rouhani said border delimitation would require further work and separate agreements, although the convention would serve as a basis for that. TRANS-CASPIAN PIPELINE Moscow has no outstanding territorial disputes but has objected, citing environmental concerns, to the construction of a natural gas pipeline between Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan which would allow Turkmen gas to bypass Russia on its way to Europe. It remained unclear whether the convention adopted on Sunday would definitely clear a way for the pipeline. Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev said the document allowed pipelines to be laid as long as certain environmental standards were met. Ashley Sherman, principal Caspian analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, said that although the signing itself was “an unprecedented milestone” for the region, the immediate implications for the energy sector would be limited. “We consider a Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline (TCGP) unlikely, even in the longer term”, he said in an email. “Clarity on the legal status will shine more light on the commercial and strategic obstacles to a TCGP, from infrastructure constraints to supply competition, not least from Azerbaijan itself.” In the upstream sector, the increasing intent for joint projects in the south Caspian is very promising, Sherman said. “Stranded fields and frozen exploration projects may well come back on the agenda,” he said. However, with offshore Caspian oil and gas production already almost at 2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, the impact from new fields - if and when disputes about their ownership are settled - might be limited. “The scale of the projects in disputed waters is not comparable to the existing super-giant fields, from Azeri Chirag Guneshli and Shah Deniz in Azerbaijan to Kashagan in Kazakhstan,” Sherman said.

2018-08-12,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier has sharply criticised U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs and sanctions policies, saying such measures were destroying jobs and growth and that Europe would not bow to U.S. pressure regarding Iran. The United States has triggered a bitter tit-for-tat trade dispute with import tariffs meant to protect American jobs against what Trump calls unfair trade practices from China, Europe and other countries. Trump’s determination to push ahead with sanctions on Tehran which also target European companies doing business with Iran has opened another battle front. “This trade war is slowing down and destroying economic growth - and it creates new uncertainties,” Altmaier told Bild am Sonntag newspaper, adding that consumers suffered the most because higher tariffs were driving up prices. Altmaier lauded the agreement reached by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker during negotiations with Trump last month, saying the interim deal had saved hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe. The U.S. and the European Union are embroiled in a spat after Trump imposed tariffs on aluminium and steel imports and Brussels responded with retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods. Trump had also threatened to impose tariffs on EU auto imports but reached an agreement to hold off on taking action after meeting with Juncker at the White House last month. “The agreement between the EU and U.S. can only be a first step. Our goal is a global trade order with lower tariffs, less protectionism and open markets,” Altmaier said. Turning to the U.S. sanctions against Iran, the minister said Germany and its EU allies would continue to support companies doing business with Iran despite U.S. pressure. “We won’t let Washington dictate us with whom we can do business and we therefore stick to the Vienna Nuclear Agreement so that Iran cannot build atomic weapons,” Altmaier said. German companies should be allowed to continue to invest in Iran as much as they want and the German government is looking for ways together with its European allies to ensure that financial transactions could still take place, he added. Several European companies have suspended plans to invest in Iran in light of the U.S. sanctions, including oil major Total (TOTF.PA) as well as carmakers PSA (PEUP.PA), Renault (RENA.PA) and Daimler (DAIGn.DE).        German business associations have warned that companies are increasingly suffering from Trump’s sanctions policies - including those against Iran - as well as the tariffs he is imposing in the escalating trade conflict with China. The trade and sanctions disputes are clouding the growth outlook for Germany, Europe’s largest economy, but Altmaier said he nonetheless expected strong growth this year due to vibrant domestic demand, record-high employment and rising wages. The Federal Statistics Office will publish preliminary gross domestic product figures for the second quarter on Tuesday, with analysts expecting the quarterly growth rate to pick up to 0.4 percent after 0.3 percent in the first quarter.

2018-08-12,"(Reuters) - NASA launched a space probe early Sunday that will go closer to the Sun than any spacecraft before, the agency announced.     The craft will endure extreme heat while zooming through the solar corona to study the Sun’s outer atmosphere that gives rise to the solar winds. The Parker Solar Probe, a spacecraft the size of a small car, launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida about 3:30 a.m. Sunday, on a seven-year mission. It is set to fly into the Sun’s corona within 3.8 million miles (6.1 million km) of the solar surface, seven times closer than any other spacecraft. The corona gives rise to the solar wind, a continuous flow of charged particles that permeates the solar system and can cause havoc with communications technology on Earth. NASA hopes the findings will enable scientists to forecast changes in Earth’s space environment. The project, with a $1.5 billion (1.17 billion pounds)price tag, is the first major mission under NASA’s Living With a Star program. The probe, named after American solar astrophysicist Eugene Newman Parker, will have to survive difficult heat and radiation conditions. It has been outfitted with a heat shield designed to keep its instruments at a tolerable 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius) even as the spacecraft faces temperatures reaching nearly 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,370 degrees Celsius) at its closest pass.
