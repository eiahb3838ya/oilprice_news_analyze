2018-10-28,"* Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * E-Mini futures for S&P 500 up 0.4 pct, Australian shares buoyant * Poor industrial profits data from China likely to weigh By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Asian shares look set for a modest bounce on Monday, though sentiment remains fragile as bears are on the ascendancy after steep declines across world financial markets last week on heightened worries over corporate earnings and global growth. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 and Dow minis jumped 0.4 percent each in early Asian trade while Nikkei futures were also in the black. New Zealand shares opened lower while Australian shares rose 0.7 percent. That left MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan 0.2 percent higher after sliding almost 4 percent last week. A sense of fear has gripped financial investors after hefty losses across major equity indices last week left them with negative returns for the year. Sentiment has been hit by a range of negative factors from an intensifying China-U.S. trade conflict to worries about U.S. corporate earnings to Italian budget woes as well as Federal Reserve rate increases. The S&P 500 ended at its lowest level since early May on Friday and flirted with correction territory, pressured by heavy losses in technology and internet shares. “Earnings in the Q3 season did underwhelm, U.S. economic and corporate earnings growth are likely in the process of peaking, the metrics watched closest by the Federal Reserve suggest tightening will continue, and American deficits are unsustainable,” JPMorgan analysts said in a note. “And, while the US-China trade tea leaves have improved over the last several weeks, the path towards détente or resolution remains nebulous.” The analysts expect the S&P500 to rebound from the current 2,650 levels although any upside will likely be limited. Poor economic indicators from China recently is also likely to weigh further on investor sentiment. Data out over the weekend showed profit growth at China’s industrial firms slowed for the fifth consecutive month in September as sales of raw materials and manufactured goods further ebbed. The Australian dollar, which is often traded as a liquid proxy from the Chinese yuan, was little changed in early trading at $0.7095. The currency fell 0.4 percent last week. The safe-haven Japanese yen has benefited from the global sell-off in riskier assets as investors unwound carry trade exposures. It gained 0.6 percent last week and was last flat at 111.89 per dollar. Over this week, investors will be keeping  an eye on the Bank of Japan monetary policy announcement due Wednesday. The dollar index was a tad firmer at 96.407 after gaining 0.7 percent last week. The euro hovered near more than two-month lows to last hold at $1.1398. Investors heaved a sigh of relief after German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s junior coalition partners gave her conservatives until next year to deliver more policy results. However, concerns loomed over her future after both parties suffered in a regional election on Sunday. In commodities, oil was a slightly higher with U.S. crude up 11 cents at $67.7 per barrel and Brent added 17 cents to $77.79. Spot gold was barely changed at 1,233.11 an ounce.

2018-10-28,"(Adds comment from Libyan oil source) By Ayman al-Warfalli BENGHAZI, Libya, Oct 28 (Reuters) - A small group of Libyan tribesmen staged a protest at the southern El Sharara oilfield last week, threatening to close down production unless their living conditions improved, a video tape showed and staff at the field said on Sunday. The field, in Libya’s remote southwest produces around 300,000 barrels per day (bpd). It has suffered shutdowns caused by security problems in the past, including raids, kidnappings and blockages by tribesmen and state-paid guards. “The situation (at El Sharara) is fragile. Nobody knows what will happen,” said a Libyan oil source, when asked about the protest which took place last Thursday. The field faced “constant threats”, the source said. The protesters demanded better state services such as water and bank liquidity for the southern Libyan region known as Fezzan, where living standards have deteriorated over the years due to tribal clashes, a lack of security and a break down of the state. They set a deadline of Nov. 11 for their demands to be met or face a shutdown of Fezzan oil and gas production in general, one protestor said in a statement on a video posted online. A member of the oilfield’s staff and one of the protesters confirmed the protest had taken place on Thursday. State oil firm NOC had no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters. In March the field shut briefly after a local landowner closed a valve in protest against pollution near a pipeline crossing his land. OPEC member Libya’s oil production is currently producing up to 1.3 million barrels a day (bpd) of oil, the chairman of state oil firm NOC told Reuters on Wednesday. That is its highest level since mid-2013 when a wave of blockades and protests by armed groups started after Libya descended into conflict following the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi.

2018-10-28,"DUBAI, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Iran began selling crude oil to private companies for export on Sunday, part of a strategy to counter U.S. sanctions which come into effect on Nov. 4 and aim to stop the country’s key crude exports, the oil ministry’s news website SHANA reported. Crude oil trade is state-controlled in Iran. Earlier, private refining companies could only buy crude oil for exports of oil products, officials have said. Out of 1 million barrels offered on the energy bourse, 280,000 barrels were sold at $74.85 per barrel, SHANA added. Iran said in July it would start oil sales to private firms as part of its efforts to keep exporting oil and would take other measures to counter sanctions after the United States told allies to cut all imports of Iranian oil from November. SHANA said Sunday’s crude sales were carried out in increments of 35,000 barrels, without naming the buyers. Washington reintroduced sanctions against Iran’s currency trade, metals and auto sectors in August after U.S. withdrawal from a multinational 2015 deal that lifted sanctions in return for limits on Iran’s nuclear program. U.S. curbs on Iran’s vital oil exports are set to come into force on Nov 4.

2018-10-28,"PARIS (Reuters) - France will ask carmakers on Monday to help fund an expanded trade-in program to get older, polluting cars off the road with incentives for new ones, the French finance minister told daily Le Parisien on Sunday. The existing government-funded scrappage scheme, which mainly targets old diesel cars, is already oversubscribed. The widening of the incentive is partly funded by a hardening of the tax on polluting vehicles adopted on Tuesday, which should raise 40 million euros (35.5 million pounds) to reach a total of 610 million next year to finance contributions for the purchase of more environment-friendly cars. The minister’s agenda says he will hold meetings with Environment Minister Francois de Rugy and carmakers, such as Renault and PSA, to “discuss measures aimed at speeding up the vehicle fleet’s ecological transition.” “With Francois de Rugy we will ask carmakers tomorrow to contribute to the conversion premium,” Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Le Parisien in an interview, adding that the incentive should be more efficient and reach more French people. The level of carmakers’ contribution to the wider scheme would have to be discussed with them, he said. Newspaper Les Echos earlier this week said French carmakers were already discussing between them the implementation at their expense of a bonus for the conversion of old vehicles. The precise outlines remained under discussion. There has been a global backlash against diesel-engine cars since leading German carmaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. exhaust tests. The scandal has boosted investment in electric vehicles and incentives for green cars. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her coalition partners agreed earlier this month on plans to cut pollution from diesel vehicles by asking carmakers to offer owners trade-in incentives and hardware fixes. But carmakers had said the focus should instead be on encouraging car owners to trade in their older diesel models for cleaner vehicles - which would bring a boost in sales, albeit at discounted prices. Volkswagen on Thursday said it will offer trade-in incentives and a bonus for scrapping older diesel vehicles in Germany. Separately, Le Maire dismissed calls to reduced taxes on fuel prices which have surged at French petrol stations after a spike in crude oil, saying this would contribute to climate change. France’s 2019 budget includes an increase in diesel taxes of more than 6 cents per liter and those on gasoline by almost 3 cents, an increase that the government has tried to downplay, comparing it to soaring oil prices.

2018-10-28,"BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The chances of Brazil’s leftist presidential candidate Fernando Haddad narrowing the lead of right-wing front-runner Jair Bolsonaro took a hit when he failed to win a crucial endorsement on Saturday, a day before the two face off in a runoff election.  However, polls published late Saturday from Brazil’s two biggest surveying firms showed momentum shifting toward Haddad, though he still trails Bolsonaro by a solid margin.  Former centre-left candidate Ciro Gomes said in a video on social media that he would not take sides in the election campaign, withholding support for Haddad of the Workers Party (PT). Gomes, a former governor of Ceará state in the northeast, is influential in Brazil’s poorest region. His endorsement could have given Haddad a big lift in the South American country’s most polarized election in a generation. But Rodrigo Janot, Brazil’s influential former prosecutor general under whose watch the country’s unprecedented investigations and prosecutions of endemic political graft took place, tweeted late Saturday that he would vote for Haddad. That was a blow to Bolsonaro’s work positioning himself as the only anti-corruption candidate. “I think we are at the brink of a process that could push our democracy beyond its limits,” Janot told Reuters late Saturday. “Freedom, equality and fraternity - always and at any cost.”  Haddad narrowed Bolsonaro’s lead to 8 percentage points in an Ibope poll released late Saturday, a survey that gave him 46 percent compared with Bolsonaro’s 54 percent.  As only two candidates remain and those figures discard voters who say they will annul their votes, that in practice means Haddad needs to win 5 percentage points to overtake the right-winger.  In a Datafolha poll also released late Saturday, Bolsonaro had 55 percent of voter backing, compared with 45 percent for Haddad.  While Haddad failed to get Gomes to endorse him, he won the backing on Saturday not just of Janot but of Brazil’s most popular YouTube host, Felipe Neto, who has 27.7 million followers on his channel. A popular anti-corruption judge, Joaquim Barbosa, who jailed several top PT leaders for corruption, also came out for Haddad. Gomes finished third in the Oct. 7 first round vote with 12 percent of the vote, behind Bolsonaro’s 46 percent and Haddad’s 29 percent. Gomes had hoped to be the standard bearer of the left but was outmanoeuvred by jailed PT leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is serving a 12-year prison sentence for corruption and anointed Haddad as his stand-in. Bolsonaro, a former Army captain, is poised to become Brazil’s first far-right president since the end of the 1964-1985 military dictatorship. The 63-year-old seven-term congressman has promised to crack down on crime and corruption, pitching himself as the anti-establishment candidate for voters fed up with political graft and violent crime. Bolsonaro’s sudden rise comes as Brazil finds itself in its worst recession and embroiled in its biggest corruption scandal after the leftist PT ran the government for 13 of the last 15 years. Until his presidential run, Bolsonaro was best known for defending the former military regime and its use of torture. He has faced charges for misogynist, racist and homophobic rants.  The Supreme Court rejected the racism charge, but has not ruled on a charge of inciting to rape in a case in which he told a fellow lawmaker she was not pretty enough to rape. He called the case political persecution. A week ago, Bolsonaro vowed to run all the “red” leftists out of Brazil or put them in jail, harsh words that probably contributed to the narrowing of his lead. YouTuber Neto said he had been neutral until that point. “Everything changed when (Bolsonaro) said he will sweep opponents out of the country or into jail. In 16 years of PT I have been robbed, but never threatened,” Neto said by Twitter. In the final two days of campaigning, Bolsonaro has sounded more moderate in his statements, backing down on a plan to follow U.S. President Donald Trump’s example and pull Brazil out of the Paris climate change accord. On Friday he told Xingú tribes people they had a right to charge royalties for mining and hydro electric power generation on their reservations, a proposal welcomed by some natives but rejected by anthropologists and environmentalists who see the tribes as the last guardians of the Amazon rainforest and its biodiversity. “You are as Brazilian as any of us,” he said in a video posted on social media. “I want you to have the right to use your land and exploit its biodiversity and mineral riches.” In his final hours of campaigning in Sao Paulo, Haddad accused the Bolsonaro camp of “sweetening” their candidate to make him appear what he is not. “He is a truculent and dangerous person, and that’s how he should be presented to the nation,” he said.
