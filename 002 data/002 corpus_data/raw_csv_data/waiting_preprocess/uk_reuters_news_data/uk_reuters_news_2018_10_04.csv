2018-10-04,"(Updates to specify that Gear may set 2019 spending lower than planned, final paragraph) By Rod Nickel WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Small Canadian oil producers are striking complex deals with refineries, diversifying production and seeking marketing help as they try to soften the blow from record price discounts on heavy crude generated by pipeline congestion. Unlike integrated companies Suncor Energy and Imperial Oil that have refineries to process their own oil, reserved pipeline space, storage, and marketing departments, small producers scrape by with less. That reality is spurring companies such as Pengrowth Energy Corp, Athabasca Oil Corp, and Gear Energy Ltd to find new strategies. Canadian heavy crude sells for less than half the price of the U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) light oil, with the differential reaching the widest level ever on Friday, according to Shorcan Energy Brokers. The price for light oil is also under pressure. Being small especially hurts when barrels are rejected by pipeline companies that do not have capacity to move all the crude produced, called apportionment. Small producers are then forced into finding new last-minute buyers, shaving a further $5 to $10 per barrel off already deeply discounted prices, said Rob Morgan, chief executive of private heavy oil producer Cona Resources. “The small to mid-size companies are going to have to step up their game,” said Jihad Traya, Calgary-based manager of strategic energy advisory services at HSB Solomon Associates. “What it comes down to now is, how clever can you be?” Fourteen percent of Western Canadian crude in 2017 was produced by companies with output of 50,000 boepd or less, not including private companies, according to a Canadian Energy Research Institute calculation using CanOils data. A vibrant junior sector is critical for the role it plays exploring boundaries of hydrocarbon pools, said Mark Oberstoetter, director of upstream research at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. While the differentials hurt, they are based off rising WTI prices, which has allowed some small producers to stay profitable, he said. More small Canadian oil producers are making sales to refineries that lock in a fixed price for the differential, allowing them to limit risk, Traya said. U.S. refiners, who benefit from the big discount, get to lock in supplies long-term. Pengrowth agreed to sell most of its 2018 crude production, 17,000 barrels per day, and 40 percent of next year’s output, 10,000 bpd, to two U.S. refineries at a fixed differential. Pengrowth also gains access to the refineries’ pipeline space. The company is now trying to lock in more of its 2019 and 2020 production on that basis, said Pengrowth CEO Pete Sametz. “It’s apportionment protection.” Athabasca is also mitigating the impact of apportionment through contracts with refineries that involve pipeline space, CEO Rob Broen said in a presentation. For some small producers, outside marketing expertise is more important than ever. Phoenix Energy Marketing has doubled the volume of crude it markets in the past three years, to 50,000 barrels per day, said president Dave Maffitt. “You know you’re going to take a haircut on price. It’s just minimizing the haircut and being knowledgeable enough about what the alternatives might be,” Maffitt said. But not all strategies are successful, and many refiners are hesitant to lock in differentials when the widening trend boosts their margins, said a Canadian industry source. “The best barrel (to buy) is the distressed barrel,” he said. One fixed-differential deal collapsed between a U.S. East Coast refiner and Canadian producer due to restrictions on older, widely used rail cars, a source at the refiner said, showing that there is no easy way around transport bottlenecks. To diversify from selling heavy crude, Gear Energy announced in July it would buy light oil assets in Saskatchewan. It may also set 2019 capital spending lower than it originally planned, CEO Ingram Gillmore said.

2018-10-04,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A two-day unloading of U.S. Treasuries pushed their yields to multiyear peaks on Thursday as robust economic data and hawkish speeches by Federal Reserve officials stoked concerns about inflation, hitting Wall Street and stock markets globally.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note US10YT=RR hit a seven-year high of 3.232 percent following data released the previous day that was seen as increasing the odds a Friday payrolls report would also be stronger than expected.

2018-10-04,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday charged seven Russian intelligence officers with conspiring to hack computers and steal data from the nuclear energy company Westinghouse Electric Co as well as anti-doping watchdogs, sporting federations and an international agency probing the use of chemical weapons. The charges of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse and to commit wire fraud and money laundering came hours after Dutch authorities said they had disrupted an attempt by Russian intelligence agents to hack into the Hague-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in April. That organisation is tasked with probing the use of chemical weapons in Syria and the March 2018 poisoning of a former Russian military intelligence officer in the United Kingdom. The Justice Department said one of the Russian officers researched Westinghouse and its employees online and stole log-in credentials of Westinghouse workers for servers in the United States, including staff that work at its advanced nuclear reactor development and new reactor technology units. Westinghouse, which is located outside Pittsburgh, provides fuel, services and nuclear power plant design to customers, including Ukraine.  “We have found no evidence that the phishing campaigns against employees to breach Westinghouse’s systems were successful,” the company said in a statement.  It added that it is cooperating with the Justice Department, but could not go into specifics because the investigation is ongoing. Three of the seven Russian military officers indicted on Thursday were charged in a separate case brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office for their role in hacking activities designed to influence the 2016 presidential election. John Demers, the head of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, said while the defendants overlap, the case brought on Thursday did not involve Mueller’s office.   In the indictment, prosecutors alleged that one of the Russian officers, Ivan Sergeyevich Yermakov, who was also charged by Mueller in the election-related hacking, performed “technical reconnaissance” on Westinghouse to gain access to IP addresses, domains and network ports starting in November 2014.  In December 2014, the hackers registered a fake domain and website designed to mimic the company’s website and sent phishing emails to at least five employees. Once people clicked on the spoofed domain and provided their log-ins, they were rerouted to the original network. On other occasions, according to the indictment, the conspirators also sent spear-phishing emails to the personal emails of employees at Westinghouse. Two account users clicked on the malicious links.      The indictment alleges that the seven defendants, all of whom are members of Russia’s military intelligence agency, sought to sow disinformation and create an influence campaign as retaliation for the exposure of a Russian state-sponsored athlete doping programme. The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency and the World Anti-Doping Agency were among their hacking targets, as well sporting organizations including the Federation Internationle de Football Association (FIFA) and athletes whose medical records were stolen and later publicized. Russia has denied meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, contradicting a unanimous conclusion by U.S. intelligence agencies. All seven of the defendants are presumed to be in Russia, which does not have an extradition treaty with the United States. The indictment could make it hard for them to travel to other countries. The hackers travelled to other countries to carry out hacking activities, sometimes with the use of diplomatic passports, prosecutors allege. Such efforts, known as “on-site” or “close access” hacking operations, were carried out in cases where remote hacking from Russia did not provide “sufficient access” to networks. One such trip, for instance, was Rio de Janeiro before and during the 2016 summer Olympic games. Some of the stolen data was later published under the false auspices of a hacktivist group known as “Fancy Bears Hack Team.” “Close access operations, like the ones exposed today, are reminders of the considerable resources available to nation states,” said John Hultquist, director of intelligence analysis at the cyber firm FireEye. While the motive behind the hacks involving anti-doping groups and organizations probing Russian poisonings were more clear-cut, the decision to target Westinghouse was less apparent. Justice Department officials declined to provide additional details on Thursday about the attacks on the company. Efforts to penetrate its networks started in late 2014, some nine months after Ukraine’s pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych was removed from power during the Ukrainian Revolution.  This is not the first time Westinghouse has been a victim of a state-sponsored hack. In May 2014, the Justice Department indicted five Chinese military hackers who targeted U.S.-based nuclear power, metals and solar sectors. According to that indictment, Westinghouse had entered into a deal with a Chinese nuclear company to construct and run four nuclear power plants in China.  But during the talks, prosecutors say one of the defendants stole proprietary and confidential technical designs and other data from Westinghouse. Reporting by Lisa Lambert, Sarah N.

2018-10-04,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday as the prospect of increased crude production from Saudi Arabia and Russia prompted profit-taking the day after futures hit four-year highs on a boost from imminent U.S. sanctions on OPEC’s No. 3 producer Iran. Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell $1.71, or 1.98 percent, to settle at $84.58 a barrel. On Wednesday, Brent rose to a late 2014 high of $86.74.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell $2.08 to settle at $74.33 a barrel, a 2.72 percent loss. Market participants took profits after Brent on Wednesday climbed to the most technically overbought level since February 2012. WTI was the most overbought since January. The relative strength index (RSI) for both Brent and U.S. crude rose this week to above 70, a level often regarded as signalling a market that has risen too far. On Thursday, both contracts’ RSI retreated to below 70. Weighing on oil prices, U.S. stock market indexes broadly fell, with the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX on pace for its biggest one-day drop since late June. Crude futures at times track with equity markets.  Also pressuring oil prices, crude inventories at the U.S. hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, rose about 1.7 million barrels from Sept. 28 to Tuesday, traders said, citing a report from market intelligence firm Genscape. “Today’s pullback appeared heavily influenced by the sharp decline in the equities and looked like a deserved correction given the magnitude of the recent upside price acceleration,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. Oil prices have risen as the market braces for sanctions on Iran that kick in on Nov. 4. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Thursday the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was able to raise output by 1.3 million barrel per day, but offered no signal that the producer group would do so. The kingdom plans to invest $20 billion to maintain and possibly expand its spare oil production capacity, and currently has a maximum sustainable capacity of 12 million bpd. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Russia and Saudi Arabia struck a private deal in September to raise output.  Rising oil prices and global trade worries are pressuring emerging economies, International Energy Agency Executive Director Fatih Birol told Reuters. India faces an “economic crisis” due to its huge oil imports, two local TV channels cited Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari as saying. India also has been hurt by a slide in the rupee against the dollar. A strong dollar makes dollar-denominated oil more expensive for buyers using other currencies. “We have argued recently that reaching the $100 market would be a tall order,” PVM Oil Associates strategist Tamas Varga said. “About the end of November, we will have a good idea as how many barrels will be lost due to the launch of the second round of the Iranian sanctions. By that time all the bullish news will be in the market.” Reporting by Stephanie Kelly in New York and additional reporting by Amanda Cooper in London; Editing by Dale Hudson, David Evans, Alexandra Hudson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/update-8-oil-falls-from-4-year-highs-wall-street-weighs-idUKL4N1WK1GX,04 Oct 2018,"Oil prices fell on Thursday as

2018-10-04,"ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - The ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) was leading in a parliamentary election in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq with 85 percent of votes counted, the election commission said on Thursday. A year after a failed bid for independence, Iraq’s Kurds voted on Sunday in a parliamentary election that could disrupt the delicate balance of power in the region. With 85 percent of ballots counted, the KDP was leading with 595,592 votes, the Independent High Elections and Referendum Commission (KHEC) said in a news conference. Its historic rival and junior coalition partner in government, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), was in second place with 287,575 votes. The commission said it had received and was investigating 1,045 complaints, which is why it had not published final results. On Sunday, the PUK said it might not recognise the results of the election due to what it described as violations in the voting process, and then appeared to backtrack, injecting uncertainty into the process. Election observers also said there were irregularities. With opposition parties weak, the KDP and PUK are likely to extend their almost three decades of sharing power, but the preliminary results suggest that Masoud Barzani’s KDP will take a dominant position in Kurdish politics. The two parties, who fought a civil war in the 1990s but more recently have taken to sharing power, have just come out of a gruelling political battle in Baghdad, where they competed for the presidency of federal Iraq. The PUK came out on top with the election of Barham Salih. The largest Kurdish opposition party, Gorran, or Movement for Change, was in a distant third with 164,336 votes. There are 111 seats in the Iraqi Kurdistan Parliament, with 11 reserved for minority groups.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Wednesday confirmed a deficit target of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2019 and said it would fall to 2.1 percent in 2020 and 1.8 percent in 2021. The estimates for 2020 and 2021 were lower than those initially reported, bringing further relief to bond markets rattled by the new government’s plans to ramp up spending. Oil prices fell as the prospect of increased crude production from Saudi Arabia and Russia prompted profit-taking the day after futures hit four-year highs on a boost from imminent U.S. sanctions on OPEC’s No. 3 producer Iran.

2018-10-04,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday charged seven Russian intelligence officers with conspiring to hack computers and steal data from the nuclear energy company Westinghouse Electric Co as well as anti-doping watchdogs, sporting federations and an international agency probing the use of chemical weapons. The charges of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse and to commit wire fraud and money laundering came hours after Dutch authorities said they had disrupted an attempt by Russian intelligence agents to hack into the Hague-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in April. That organisation is tasked with probing the use of chemical weapons in Syria and the March 2018 poisoning of a former Russian military intelligence officer in the United Kingdom. The Justice Department said one of the Russian officers researched Westinghouse and its employees online and stole log-in credentials of Westinghouse workers for servers in the United States, including staff that work at its advanced nuclear reactor development and new reactor technology units. Westinghouse, which is located outside Pittsburgh, provides fuel, services and nuclear power plant design to customers, including Ukraine.  “We have found no evidence that the phishing campaigns against employees to breach Westinghouse’s systems were successful,” the company said in a statement.  It added that it is cooperating with the Justice Department, but could not go into specifics because the investigation is ongoing. Three of the seven Russian military officers indicted on Thursday were charged in a separate case brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office for their role in hacking activities designed to influence the 2016 presidential election. John Demers, the head of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, said while the defendants overlap, the case brought on Thursday did not involve Mueller’s office.   In the indictment, prosecutors alleged that one of the Russian officers, Ivan Sergeyevich Yermakov, who was also charged by Mueller in the election-related hacking, performed “technical reconnaissance” on Westinghouse to gain access to IP addresses, domains and network ports starting in November 2014.  In December 2014, the hackers registered a fake domain and website designed to mimic the company’s website and sent phishing emails to at least five employees. Once people clicked on the spoofed domain and provided their log-ins, they were rerouted to the original network. On other occasions, according to the indictment, the conspirators also sent spear-phishing emails to the personal emails of employees at Westinghouse. Two account users clicked on the malicious links.      The indictment alleges that the seven defendants, all of whom are members of Russia’s military intelligence agency, sought to sow disinformation and create an influence campaign as retaliation for the exposure of a Russian state-sponsored athlete doping programme. The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency and the World Anti-Doping Agency were among their hacking targets, as well sporting organizations including the Federation Internationle de Football Association (FIFA) and athletes whose medical records were stolen and later publicized. Russia has denied meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, contradicting a unanimous conclusion by U.S. intelligence agencies. All seven of the defendants are presumed to be in Russia, which does not have an extradition treaty with the United States. The indictment could make it hard for them to travel to other countries. The hackers travelled to other countries to carry out hacking activities, sometimes with the use of diplomatic passports, prosecutors allege. Such efforts, known as “on-site” or “close access” hacking operations, were carried out in cases where remote hacking from Russia did not provide “sufficient access” to networks. One such trip, for instance, was Rio de Janeiro before and during the 2016 summer Olympic games. Some of the stolen data was later published under the false auspices of a hacktivist group known as “Fancy Bears Hack Team.” “Close access operations, like the ones exposed today, are reminders of the considerable resources available to nation states,” said John Hultquist, director of intelligence analysis at the cyber firm FireEye. While the motive behind the hacks involving anti-doping groups and organizations probing Russian poisonings were more clear-cut, the decision to target Westinghouse was less apparent. Justice Department officials declined to provide additional details on Thursday about the attacks on the company. Efforts to penetrate its networks started in late 2014, some nine months after Ukraine’s pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych was removed from power during the Ukrainian Revolution.  This is not the first time Westinghouse has been a victim of a state-sponsored hack. In May 2014, the Justice Department indicted five Chinese military hackers who targeted U.S.-based nuclear power, metals and solar sectors. According to that indictment, Westinghouse had entered into a deal with a Chinese nuclear company to construct and run four nuclear power plants in China.  But during the talks, prosecutors say one of the defendants stole proprietary and confidential technical designs and other data from Westinghouse. Reporting by Lisa Lambert, Sarah N.

2018-10-04,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday as the prospect of increased crude production from Saudi Arabia and Russia prompted profit-taking the day after futures hit four-year highs on a boost from imminent U.S. sanctions on OPEC’s No. 3 producer Iran. Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell $1.71, or 1.98 percent, to settle at $84.58 a barrel. On Wednesday, Brent rose to a late 2014 high of $86.74.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell $2.08 to settle at $74.33 a barrel, a 2.72 percent loss. Market participants took profits after Brent on Wednesday climbed to the most technically overbought level since February 2012. WTI was the most overbought since January. The relative strength index (RSI) for both Brent and U.S. crude rose this week to above 70, a level often regarded as signalling a market that has risen too far. On Thursday, both contracts’ RSI retreated to below 70. Weighing on oil prices, U.S. stock market indexes broadly fell, with the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX on pace for its biggest one-day drop since late June. Crude futures at times track with equity markets.  Also pressuring oil prices, crude inventories at the U.S. hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, rose about 1.7 million barrels from Sept. 28 to Tuesday, traders said, citing a report from market intelligence firm Genscape. “Today’s pullback appeared heavily influenced by the sharp decline in the equities and looked like a deserved correction given the magnitude of the recent upside price acceleration,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. Oil prices have risen as the market braces for sanctions on Iran that kick in on Nov. 4. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Thursday the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was able to raise output by 1.3 million barrel per day, but offered no signal that the producer group would do so. The kingdom plans to invest $20 billion to maintain and possibly expand its spare oil production capacity, and currently has a maximum sustainable capacity of 12 million bpd. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Russia and Saudi Arabia struck a private deal in September to raise output.  Rising oil prices and global trade worries are pressuring emerging economies, International Energy Agency Executive Director Fatih Birol told Reuters. India faces an “economic crisis” due to its huge oil imports, two local TV channels cited Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari as saying. India also has been hurt by a slide in the rupee against the dollar. A strong dollar makes dollar-denominated oil more expensive for buyers using other currencies. “We have argued recently that reaching the $100 market would be a tall order,” PVM Oil Associates strategist Tamas Varga said. “About the end of November, we will have a good idea as how many barrels will be lost due to the launch of the second round of the Iranian sanctions. By that time all the bullish news will be in the market.” Reporting by Stephanie Kelly in New York and additional reporting by Amanda Cooper in London; Editing by Dale Hudson, David Evans, Alexandra Hudson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/update-8-oil-falls-from-4-year-highs-wall-street-weighs-idUKL4N1WK1GX,04 Oct 2018,"Oil prices fell on Thursday as

The yield on the benchmark 10-year note hit a high of 3.232 percent following data released the previous day that was seen as increasing the odds a Friday payrolls report would also be stronger than expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the economy can expand for “quite some time,” which also helped the yield curve steepen to its highest in two months. Stocks, in turn, have fallen broadly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 282.61 points, or 1.05 percent, to 26,545.78, the S&P 500 lost 32.29 points, or 1.10 percent, to 2,893.22 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 159.50 points, or 1.99 percent, to 7,865.59. The CBOE Global Markets volatility index .VIX, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, rose 4.12 points, its highest surge since Aug. 15. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 1.02 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.22 percent. The surge in Treasury yields has also prompted a rise in government bond yields across the globe. “We saw very large overnight volumes during both the Tokyo and London trading hours, which was a catch-up in foreign sovereign markets to the very large sell-off in U.S. Treasuries yesterday,” said Jon Hill, U.S. rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets. Euro zone bond yields rose sharply, tracking their U.S. counterparts, while the “trans-Atlantic spread” between United States and German 10-year bond yields hit a three-decade high of around 275 bps. The U.S. dollar weakened against the euro and yen but lingered near recent highs as investors digested U.S. economic data and Powell’s remarks. The dollar index rose 0.01 percent, with the euro up 0.3 percent to $1.151. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.60 percent versus the greenback at 113.87 per dollar. Investors will now eye the U.S. government’s September payroll report scheduled for release on Friday. “That sense of the market’s rising discomfort about inflation risks leads me to expect the wage inflation reading within the U.S. nonfarm payrolls on Friday will be critical to the current sell-off,” wrote Brian Daingerfield, macro strategist at NatWest Markets.

2018-10-04,"* Exchange delayed launch of electricity futures in July * Spot price volatility driving demand for futures, CEO says * New rubber contract will attract Thai producers, Chinese buyers By Aaron Sheldrick and Yuka Obayashi TOKYO, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) may start trading of its electric power futures contract as early as January, part of an effort to return to profitability by expanding its product listings, its chief executive officer said on Wednesday. In March 2016, Japan opened its electric power sector to competition causing the country’s utilities to embrace more spot power trading, with volumes on the Japan Electric Power Exchange more than quadrupling. The demand for power futures on TOCOM to help utilities to manage the price volatility that has followed the spot trading surge may help the exchange reverse three years of losses incurred amid stiff competition with futures markets in China and Singapore. “The (spot) market is too volatile, especially in the summer and winter,” said TOCOM Chief Executive Officer Takamichi Hamada said in an interview, pointing to a need for new power suppliers to be able to hedge in the futures market. A sweltering summer drove prices on the Japan Electric Power Exchange to just above 100 yen ($0.90) per kilowatt hour in July, the highest on record, as new entrants scrambled to meet the demand for cooling. TOCOM delayed the launch of the electricity futures in July as utilities and other market participants needed more time to get their systems in place. Hamada wants the new futures contract to be running by January to have two months of settlement before the end of the financial year in March. TOCOM reported a third straight year of losses for the 2017/18 financial year, but Hamada is hopeful that the new products will help it turn to profitable this year. “Cost cut, marketing to broaden participants and new contracts are the three key pillars to turn us around,” he said. Last financial year, TOCOM’s total trading volumes were 24 million contracts, only about a quarter of the record 87 million contracts traded in 2003. TOCOM also plans to boost trading volumes by adding a new rubber product, Hamada said, a market where the exchange has been active since the 1950s. On Oct. 9, TOCOM will launch new technically specified rubber (TSR) futures to meet growing demand for the product. The exchange’s existing ribbed smoked sheet (RSS) futures have been a benchmark for the Asian rubber market since they were first offered in 1952. However, rubber consumers, particularly tyre-makers, have started to prefer TSR, which is largely machine produced and is considered a more consistent product, to the smoked sheets, which are put together by hand and can have some variance in quality. TOCOM’s new TSR contract will be for physical delivery on a Free on Board (FOB) basis at two ports in Thailand and one in Malaysia. Trading in TSR futures on the Singapore Exchange tripled between 2014 and 2017 while TOCOM’s RSS contract volumes have fallen by more than a tenth. “Singapore’s TSR is mainly linked with the Indonesian product, but our TSR meets the product standard in Thailand, the world’s biggest natural rubber producer,” Hamada said, adding that it will likely attract Thai producers and shippers as well as buyers in China, the world’s biggest rubber consumer, for hedging and arbitrage. The Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) has bypassed TOCOM on rubber futures volumes, with ShFE’s turnover in 2017 of 89 million contracts 42 times higher than the Japanese exchange’s volumes.

2018-10-04,"* Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Dollar holds gains, nears major chart barrier on yen * Market pricing in more aggressive Fed on strong US data * 10-year Treasury yields highest since 2011 at 3.22 pct * Asian stocks stagger as borrowing costs rise By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The dollar scored an 11-month top on the yen on Thursday as stunningly strong U.S. economic data drove Treasury yields to their highest since May 2011, while Asian stocks were sideswiped by rising borrowing costs at home. Higher U.S. yields are anything but favourable for emerging markets as they tend to draw away much-needed foreign funds while pressuring local currencies. Bond prices fell across Asia and long-term Japanese yields reached ground not visited since early 2016, a market tightening not warranted by domestic economic conditions. “A simple dynamic is playing out in the global economy right now - the U.S. is booming, while most of the rest of the world slows or even stagnates,” said HSBC economist Kevin Logan. “A Federal Reserve that is raising rates to prevent the U.S. economy from overheating is constraining the policy options of countries where financial conditions are tightening and trade tensions intensifying.” MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan skidded 1.7 percent in response, with South Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia and Taiwan all down. Even the Nikkei eased 0.3 percent, as rising yields offset the boost to exporters from a weaker yen. EMini futures for the S&P 500 also lost 0.4 percent in Asian trade, while European bourses were seen starting mixed. The dollar had taken off after an influential survey of the U.S. services sector showed activity at its strongest since August 1997, sparking speculation the payrolls report on Friday could also surprise. “The (ISM) index was significantly above the long-term average during periods of growth and consistent with the upside risks to growth,” said Kevin Cummins, senior U.S. economist at NatWest Markets. “At a minimum, these data suggest that labour demand remains very strong.” Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell declared the economic outlook was “remarkably positive” and said rates might rise above “neutral”, currently anywhere from 2.5 to 3 percent. A Fed hike in December is now put at an 8 in 10 chance, while investors lifted expectations for how high rates may eventually go. Fed fund futures for December 2019 sank to a contract low of 97.095, implying a rate of 2.905 percent. At the start of this year they had looked for only 2.1 percent. Yields on 10-year Treasury debt were up at 3.225 percent, having spiked 12 basis points overnight. That was the steepest daily increase since the shock outcome of the U.S. presidential election in November 2016. The jump in yields boosted financial shares on Wednesday, putting the S&P 500 within striking distance of a record. The Dow rose 0.2 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.07 percent and the Nasdaq 0.32 percent. The groundswell of economic optimism swept the U.S. dollar to a six-week high on a basket of currencies and it was last trading up 0.34 percent at 96.086. The gains were broad based with the euro falling back to $1.1471 after being as high as $1.1593 on Wednesday. The dollar shot to its highest so far this year on the yen at 114.55 before steadying at 114.40. It was now threatening a major peak from November 2017 at 114.735. In Asia, the Indian rupee and Indonesian rupiah have been under heavy fire, in part because both countries are being squeezed by the soaring cost of imported oil. Oil prices have reached four-year peaks as the market focused on upcoming U.S. sanctions on Iran while shrugging off the year’s largest weekly build in U.S. crude stockpiles. Brent eased 17 cents to $86.12 a barrel on Thursday, while U.S. crude fell 15 cents to $76.26.

2018-10-04,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Oil traders have piled into wagers that U.S. crude oil could surge to $100 a barrel by next year, a milestone that until recently many considered unthinkable due to record U.S. production growth and relatively flat global demand. But the imminent return of U.S. sanctions on Iran and bottlenecks keeping U.S. oil from getting to market have fueled a rally that has taken benchmark oil prices to four-year highs.  While big producing nations say supply is ample, hedge funds and speculators are increasingly skeptical of that argument, betting the market could rally further as sanctions on Iran’s crude exports return on Nov. 4.  The bullishness is visible in the U.S. options market.  The number of open positions on $100 December 2019 WTI call options CL1000L9 - bets on futures hitting that price by the end of 2019 - has risen by 30 percent in the last week to a record 31,000 lots, according to CME data.  “Over the last two weeks, there’s been a lot more evidence that even some of the larger customers - India and China - are not going to be buying Iranian crude from November,” said John Saucer, vice president of research and analysis at Mobius Risk Group.  As a result, he said, “these sanctions are likely to be a lot more effective than people even thought.”    Overall exports from Iran have dropped to 2 million barrels per day (bpd) in September from 2.8 million bpd in April, the Institute of International Finance said.  Estimates for how much of Iran’s exports could be affected range from 500,000 bpd to 2 million bpd, and uncertainty over the impact could ultimately foster price swings in either direction. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose above $86 a barrel on Wednesday, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) U.S. crude hit $76 a barrel, both four-year highs. The Trump administration’s decision to renew sanctions on Iran prompted a sharp shift from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. After about 18 months of restraining supply, OPEC agreed to increase output. Further, Saudi Arabia and Russia recently agreed privately to boost supply before telling other OPEC countries in an effort to mollify U.S. President Donald Trump, who has focused his anger on rising prices. Oil markets are looking to OPEC and Russia to make up shortfalls in supply. U.S. production, which sits at a record 11.1 million bpd, cannot replace Middle East crudes, such as Iranian grades, in Asian refineries. In addition, transportation bottlenecks are constraining U.S. output. “We continue to see price risks tilted to the upside and do not rule out a spike in oil prices to $100/barrel,” UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.  Open interest in $100 December 2018 Brent call options LCO10000L8, which expire in late October, is currently more than 50,000 lots, more than any other strike price for that month, according to InterContinental Exchange data. (For a graphic on 'Traders bet on $100 oil as Iran sanctions approach' click reut.rs/2Oy7mvY) Implied volatility for very bullish Brent options that expire after the Nov. 4 resumption of sanctions has overtaken that for very bearish options, suggesting increased demand for such bullish bets. This spread, or skew, is at its most bullish since mid July. Open interest in $100 December 2018 WTI calls CL1000L8, which expire in mid-November, has risen to the highest in over four months at about 15,000 lots.   Many traders said these $100 bets face long odds. Option contracts used to speculate on far-fetched outcomes tend to be cheap, and if crude’s rally stalls, those positions will expire worthless. But even a short-term jump could make those options more expensive, and holders could sell them for a profit.

2018-10-04,"MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The financial squeeze on India’s farmers is set to worsen because of record high fuel prices and surging costs of fertilisers, posing a challenge to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an election that must be held by May. The rise in input prices could not have come at worse time for farmers, already grappling with falling domestic product prices due to rising yields and abundant harvests. Yet, the government has few easy options to respond. Rival global producers have complained about Indian state support and falling global farm product prices undermine export prospects. Indian farmers voted overwhelmingly for Modi in 2014. But a fall in rural incomes risks damaging that support next year. Thousands of farmers marched on New Delhi on Tuesday to demand better prices for their produce. Police responded with teargas and water cannon. Farmers suspended their protests after talks with officials that ran into early Wednesday morning. But their demands and those of other agriculture workers, who together make up about half India’s 1.3 billion people, have not gone away. [nL4N1WI2LX] “Although we have decided to end our protest, we still believe that the government is not serious about addressing the concerns of the farmers,” Anil Talan, national secretary of farmers body Bhartiya Kisan Union, said after the march. Diesel prices have surged 26 percent this year, making tilling fields, harvesting and transporting crops expensive for India’s 263 million farmers who mostly use diesel tractors. Alongside rising diesel costs, prices of key fertilisers such as potash and phosphate have jumped nearly 15 and 17 percent respectively in a year, as companies pass on the rise in global prices and the impact of the weak rupee to farmers. India, the world’s second-biggest producer of staples such as rice and wheat, imports all its potash needs and relies on foreign supplies for nearly 90 percent of the phosphate it uses. “It’s a double whammy for farmers who have to bear the brunt of lower crop prices and higher input costs,” said Devinder Sharma, an independent food and trade policy analyst, saying this explained “why farmers’ anger has come to the fore.” Diesel demand is rising as farmers have started harvesting summer crops. After tilling, they will plant wheat and rapeseed, the main winter crops. Union official Talan said the government needed to prop up commodity prices and keep a lid on farmers’ costs to support the agricultural industry, which accounts for about 16 percent of India’s $2.6 trillion (£2 trillion) economy. Graphic: Oil prices in different currencies (tmsnrt.rs/2N67zl9) “Because of higher diesel prices I need to spend nearly 20 percent more on harvesting soybean but soybean prices have crashed this year,” said Uttam Jagdale, a farmer from Pune, about 150 km (94 miles) south of Mumbai. Nilesh Sable, a cane farmer from Sangli in the western state of Maharashtra, said fertiliser prices were rising each month. Fertiliser firms say they have little choice but to pass on at least some extra costs due to a sharp fall in the rupee and a 20 percent rise in international potash and phosphate prices. “Still, we are not passing the entire burden to farmers,” said an official with a state-run fertiliser company, asking not to be named in line with government policy. Greater farm efficiency is partly to blame. Mechanised farming, high-yielding seed varieties and increased use of pesticides have pushed up harvests. Output of most crops has soared to record levels each year.     India’s production of pulses, such as lentils and beans, surged to 24.51 million tonnes in the year to June 2018, up from 23.13 million tonnes in the previous 12 months. Imports of pulses, such as lentils from Canada, Australia and Russia, fell to 1.2 million tonnes in the financial year to March 2019, the lowest since 2000/01 and well below the 6.6 million tonnes imported in 2016/17 after back-to-back failures in the monsoon. Plentiful supplies extend to other crops. India is set to surpass Brazil as the world’s top sugar producer in the 2018/19 season, but rising output has driven down local sugar prices by 15 percent and left mills nursing losses.  In bid to help the sector, the government unveiled measures last week such as transport subsidies and incentives to export at least 5 million tonnes of sugar. Brazil, Thailand, Australia and other rival producers were quick to complain. [nL4N1WC3I7] Vegetable prices, especially onions, cabbage and tomatoes, have also fallen 25 percent from last year, largely because of overproduction. Without enough refrigerated trucks, excess production cannot be stored. Domestic milk prices dived more than 25 percent in the past year, but a global glut has made Indian exports uncompetitive. Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities in Mumbai, said India needed to find markets abroad to reduce its inventories. “But exports will not be easy, as global prices are depressed, and there is no export parity for most commodities,” he said.

2018-10-04,"PORTLAND, Oregon, Oct 4 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Three years ago, a group of eighth graders came before Portland’s City Council to ask for something unusual: a ban on new facilities to transport or store fossil fuels in the city. Quoting Dr. Seuss, singing Bob Dylan’s “The Times They Are A Changing” and performing a short play set 200 years in the future, they told the officials fossil fuels had no place in a world struggling with climate change - or in Portland’s future. Later that day, city officials unanimously voted for the first-in-the-nation ban. “This is the first stone in a green wall of resistance against fossil fuel facilities on the West Coast,” promised then-Mayor Charlie Hales, who heralded the ordinance as an example of how cities can take action against climate change. Today, more than 70 cities around the world - including green-leaning Portland - have pledged to become “carbon neutral” by 2050, meaning they will eliminate nearly all fossil fuel emissions and offset what they cannot, through actions such as planting carbon-absorbing trees. Each city is pushing toward the goal in its own way, to help meet the emissions-cutting goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which aim to hold off the worst impacts of global warming, from fiercer storms to more frequent crop failures. But the road to becoming a “zero carbon city” is rarely a simple or easy one, as Portland has discovered. After passing its landmark policy, which banned construction of new, large-scale fossil fuel facilities in the city, Portland was hit by a legal challenge from petroleum trade groups and a local business coalition The groups argued the city had overstepped its constitutional bounds by effectively blocking interstate commerce, an argument the state land use court upheld in July 2017. The city then appealed and won - a decision ultimately upheld by the state Supreme Court in July. “We are disappointed that the Oregon Supreme Court declined to review this case,” said Kara Siepmann, a spokeswoman for the Western States Petroleum Association, one of the original challengers. “This matter remains very important to our industry, the city of Portland, and all Oregonians who rely on terminals for safe and reliable access to fuel,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation via e-mail. The Portland Business Alliance, another challenger, declined to comment. The ruling now clears the way for Portland to put its new law into effect - but only after years of delay. “People in Portland fight to defend what we love from dirty fossil fuel projects like oil train terminals,” said Dan Serres, conservation director for Columbia Riverkeeper, an environmental non-government organization that joined the city’s court appeal. “The city of Portland made history when it adopted the fossil fuel ordinance. With these challenges from the oil industry and the Portland Business Alliance out of the way, Portland can move forward toward putting this policy into practice,” he said. Turning the policy into day-to-day action in the city, however, will bring its own challenges. The ordinance calls for the city council to “actively oppose expansion of infrastructure whose primary purpose is transporting or storing fossil fuels in or through Portland or adjacent waterways”. Determining what projects do that is up to the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability. It has modified the city’s zoning code to restrict what it calls “bulk fossil fuel terminals” - facilities with the capacity to hold more than 2 million gallons (7.5 million litres) of fuels such as oil, natural gas or propane. Portland doesn’t aim to phase out fossil fuels entirely just yet. While it pledged last year to aim for 100 percent renewable energy - on the day U.S. President Donald Trump said he would withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement - Portland for now still needs existing oil and natural gas distribution networks to heat homes and fuel automobiles. But “we have enough,” Portland city planner Tom Armstrong, who worked on the zoning code, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview. Banning new fossil fuel infrastructure supports the city’s 100 percent renewable pledge and its climate action plan. But it’s also aimed at reducing another risk - from earthquakes. “Climate action issues aside, our port facilities are not located in the best place when it comes to seismic risk,” Armstrong said. When the city studied existing riverfront oil and gas terminals, researchers discovered they all sit on land susceptible to liquefaction - when saturated soil begins acting like a liquid - during an earthquake. With Portland situated near a major 600-mile-long fault zone off the U.S. West Coast, “zoning is about ensuring public health and safety and that’s what we’re trying to do in Portland,” Armstrong said. “No one wants a fossil fuel terminal exploding in their backyard,” Mia Reback of 350PDX, the local chapter of a climate activist organisation, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The constellation of oil tanks, propane terminals and liquid natural gas plants along Portland’s Willamette River lies just a few miles from the city’s downtown, with its trendy food trucks and artisanal doughnut shops. Serres - and city planner Armstrong - say they have noticed an increase in oil trains moving through the city, some carrying fuel from Canada’s Alberta tar sands bound for ships to Asia and elsewhere. Serres believes Portland’s geography at the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia rivers - along the flattest route between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Ocean - makes it uniquely positioned to slow down worldwide distribution of fossil fuels. “We sit between large international markets overseas in Asia and globally significant fossil fuel reserves in the middle of the North American continent,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Armstrong does not see the city’s role as disrupting that flow of commerce, “but we do have a say in how land gets used in our city,” he said. Portland is not the only city looking at the question. Vancouver, a city on the north side of the Columbia River, in the state of Washington, banned bulk oil terminals in 2016. Other deep-water ports along the lower Columbia are also considering whether to accept facilities ranging from coal terminals to methanol refineries - but so far Portland has taken the strongest line against them. “The Portland ordinance was the first time we saw a municipality take a big, affirmative step to say no, we’re going to move in a different direction,” Serres said. Allowing the expansion of fossil fuel facilities could add cash from property taxes and business license fees to Portland’s coffers. But Armstrong said he does not think the ban will have a significant financial impact on the city. What is more worrisome is the relatively slow progress toward the city’s 100 percent renewable energy pledge, local climate activists say. They are pushing a citizen’s initiative on the November election ballot that would tax businesses to create a $30 million annual clean energy fund for the city. The money would pay to install rooftop solar arrays, weatherize homes, and offer job training in green energy fields. “This is not yet reality - and is only a piece of what’s needed from the city,” said 350PDX’s Anais Tupeker.

Higher U.S. yields are anything but favourable for emerging markets as they tend to draw away much-needed foreign funds while pressuring local currencies. Bond prices fell across Asia and long-term Japanese yields reached ground not visited since early 2016, a market tightening not warranted by domestic economic conditions. “A simple dynamic is playing out in the global economy right now - the U.S. is booming, while most of the rest of the world slows or even stagnates,” said HSBC economist Kevin Logan. “A Federal Reserve that is raising rates to prevent the U.S. economy from overheating is constraining the policy options of countries where financial conditions are tightening and trade tensions intensifying.” MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan skidded 1.1 percent in response, with South Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia and Taiwan all down. Even the Nikkei eased 0.2 percent, as rising yields offset the boost to exporters from a weaker yen. The dollar had taken off after an influential survey of the U.S. services sector showed activity at its strongest since August 1997, sparking speculation the payrolls report on Friday could also surprise. “The (ISM) index was significantly above the long-term average during periods of growth and consistent with the upside risks to growth,” said Kevin Cummins, senior U.S. economist at NatWest Markets. “At a minimum, these data suggest that labour demand remains very strong.” Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell declared the economic outlook was “remarkably positive” and said rates might rise above “neutral”, currently anywhere from 2.5 to 3 percent. A Fed hike in December is now put at an 8 in 10 chance, while investors lifted expectations for how high rates may eventually go. Fed fund futures for December 2019 sank to a contract low of 97.12, implying a rate of 2.88 percent. At the start of this year they had looked for only 2.1 percent. Yields on 10-year Treasury debt were at 3.18 percent, having spiked 12 basis points overnight to the highest since June 2011. It was the steepest daily increase since the shock outcome of the U.S. presidential election in November 2016. The jump in yields boosted financial shares on Wednesday, putting the S&P 500 within striking distance of a record. Financials were also aided by signs Italy would cut its budget deficit and lower its debt, easing concerns that had pressured global stock markets. The Dow rose 0.2 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.07 percent and the Nasdaq 0.32 percent. The groundswell of economic optimism swept the U.S. dollar to a six-week high on a basket of currencies and it was last trading up at 96.085. The gains were broad based with the euro falling back to $1.1471 after being as high as $1.1593 on Wednesday. The dollar shot to its highest so far this year on the yen at 114.55 before steadying at 114.35. It was now threatening a major peak from November 2017 at 114.735. In Asia, the Indian rupee and Indonesian rupiah have been under heavy fire, in part because both countries are being squeezed by the soaring cost of imported oil. Oil prices have reached four-year peaks as the market focused on upcoming U.S. sanctions on Iran while shrugging off the year’s largest weekly build in U.S. crude stockpiles.

Brent crude oil futures were trading at $85.85 per barrel at 0104 GMT, down 44 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last close. Brent on Wednesday hit a four-year high of $86.74 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 30 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $76.11 a barrel. “Data for last week showed a much more significant than expected ... build in U.S. commercial crude (inventories), which generally suggests that oil prices should tumble,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore. U.S. crude oil stocks C-STK-T-EIA rose by nearly 8 million barrels last week to about 404 million barrels, the biggest increase since March 2017, Energy Information Administration data showed on Wednesday. U.S. weekly Midwest refinery utilization rates dropped to 78.9 percent, their lowest since October 2015, according to the data. Meanwhile, U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA remained at a record-high of 11.1 million barrels per day (bpd). “This on top of the other big news of the day from Riyadh that ... Saudi Arabia and Russia will boost output,” Innes said. Russia and Saudi Arabia struck a private deal in September to raise oil output to cool rising prices, Reuters reported on Wednesday, before consulting with other producers, including the rest of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Russia’s and Saudi Arabia’s actions come as markets have heated up ahead of U.S. sanctions against Iran’s oil sector, which are set to kick in from Nov. 4, and which many analysts expect to knock around 1.5 million bpd of supply out of markets. On the demand side, there is increasing concern that high oil prices and weakening emerging market currencies are creating a toxic inflationary mix that could erode fuel demand and economic growth. “We have been taking a very close look at the demand signals in the market, and what we have been seeing is not good, JBC Energy said on Wednesday in a note to clients. The energy consultancy said it had revised its oil demand forecast downwards amid Brent prices above $80 and diving currencies in many emerging markets, as well as burgeoning product stocks and the ongoing Sino-U.S. trade dispute. “We are not talking about cosmetic changes either. We have cut our forecast for 2018 demand growth by a whopping 300,000 bpd to below 1.1 million bpd,” it said. Reporting by Henning Gloystein

2018-10-04,"(Adds details and comments throughout) By Mayank Bhardwaj and Aditya Kalra NEW DELHI, Oct 4 (Reuters) - India is cutting prices of gasoline and diesel by 2.50 rupees ($0.03) a litre, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Thursday, the government’s latest step to tackle the impact of a sharp rise in crude oil prices and a weak local currency. The cut includes a reduction in excise duty of 1.50 rupees per litre, which will reduce government revenue by 105 billion rupees, Jaitley said. State-run refiners will also cut the price they charge by 1 rupee per litre. Jaitley also asked state governments to cut value added tax on fuel by a further 2.50 rupees per litre. Taxes on gasoline and diesel, which account for more than a third of retail fuel prices, are one of the biggest sources of income for the government, which is seeking to keep the country’s budget deficit in check. “It certainly has fiscal implications. If the government wishes to stick to its glidepath of fiscal consolidation, then it will have to cut its expenditures significantly,” said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at L&T Finance Holdings. Shares in Indian Oil Corp, the country’s biggest oil refiner, dropped 11.4 percent in reaction to the news. The price cut is likely to result in a loss of margin of 70-72 billion Indian rupees on auto fuel sales, according to K Ravichandran, senior vice president, corporate ratings, at ratings agency ICRA Ltd. Among other state-run companies, shares in Hindustan Petroleum Corp closed down 13.5 percent, and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd lost 12.4 percent. The Nifty Energy Index fell 6.14 percent. Global crude prices hit near 4-year highs on Wednesday, and a weak rupee has added to the woes of Indians, who have been hit by record high fuel prices. India’s fuel demand grew at its slowest pace in the last twelve months in August. India stopped controlling petrol prices in 2010 and diesel prices in 2014, linking them to global crude markets in a bid to ease pressure on government finances and improve the earnings of oil refiners. But analysts said the announcement on Thursday shows there is still a heavy government hand in the industry. “By asking the oil marketing companies to absorb the price hike, the government is giving a signal that it can interfere at anytime in a deregulated market in the larger public interest,” said Gagan Dixit, a senior analyst with Elara Capital. Rising gasoline and diesel fuel prices have been a cause of public anger, with people in parts of the country blocking trains and vandalising vehicles in protest. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party is facing a tough election in three key states this year, followed by a national election which is due by May. Asked by a reporter about the economic implications of the move, Jaitley said the decision was “good economics” as it won’t impact the fiscal deficit and will allow consumers to boost spending on other goods. Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist at India Ratings and Research, said the move could act as a “minor comforting factor” for the central bank during its monetary policy meeting scheduled on Friday, as a fuel price cut will ease retail inflation. The national reduction translates to a 3 percent cut in gasoline prices, and a 3.3 percent fall in diesel prices in India’s capital New Delhi. Fuel prices are not uniform across the country due to variable state taxes. Gasoline was sold at 83.85 rupees a litre, while diesel was sold at 75.25 a litre on October 3, according to state-run retailer Indian Oil Corp’s website. Some states such as Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Assam and Maharashtra, ruled by Modi’s BJP, cut their own taxes following the federal government’s announcement. But it is unclear how many of India’s 29 states will meet the request, though some had in recent weeks already reduced their take. “I hope all state governments do this, and they announce this so that consumers benefit by 5 rupees,” Jaitley told reporters. $1 = 73.5750 Indian rupees

2018-10-04,"LONDON (Reuters) - Crude oil prices continue to climb despite attempts by oil producers to reassure the market about availability and the existence of enough spare capacity to offset oil lost as a result of U.S. sanctions on Iran. Recent price moves bear a strong resemblance to previous price spikes in 2007-2008 and 2010-2012, especially if prices are expressed in euros or yen to eliminate the impact of a stronger dollar this time around. Brent crude has risen to almost 75 euros per barrel, the same level it reached in May 2008, on its way to a peak of 93 euros in July 2008 (reut.rs/2ykGpSe). Front-month futures have also hit 9,800 yen per barrel, the same as in October 2007, on their way to a peak of 15,300 yen in July 2008 (reut.rs/2yhI5fu). Prices in Indian rupees are already at the same level that they peaked in 2008 and on the way to the record set in 2013 (reut.rs/2yghZtk). Only the strength of the dollar against other currencies is masking how high prices have become in oil-consuming countries outside the United States. (https://reut.rs/2ygcACh) (reut.rs/2ykH3z8). Prices have already risen to a level that has contributed to a slowdown in economic growth and oil consumption in the past. “Expensive energy is back at a bad time for the global economy,” the chief executive of the International Energy Agency has warned (“IEA boss urges oil producers to ease supply concerns”, Reuters, Oct. 4). “It is now high time for all the players, especially those key producers and oil exporters, to consider the situation and take the right steps to comfort the market,” he added. The blame-shifting game is well underway, with the United States blaming OPEC, Russia faulting U.S. sanctions, and Saudi Arabia blaming speculators for escalating prices. In reality, U.S. sanctions, output restrictions by OPEC and its allies, strong consumption growth and position building among the hedge funds have all contributed to the price surge. Aggressive implementation of U.S. sanctions on Iran has left refiners and traders concerned about the future availability of crude and questioning whether OPEC will still have enough spare capacity to offset any other losses. OPEC and its allies became fixated on cutting oil inventories down to the five-year average and waited far too long to start exiting from production curbs, causing the market to overtighten. And oil consumption has grown much faster than most analysts forecast at the start of the year, while many non-OPEC sources of supply have risen more slowly than expected. Despite communications between policymakers in the United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia to synchronise output increases with the re-introduction of sanctions there seem to have been a series of misunderstandings. Policymakers appear to have misjudged how quickly the United States would try to cut Iran’s exports and how rapidly other OPEC and non-OPEC producers could fill the gap. Sensing the market is moving into a cyclical period of under-supply and low spare capacity, hedge funds and other money managers have built bullish long positions, accelerating and exaggerating the price adjustment. The oil market has become locked in an upward price trend as hedge funds and market makers all try to maintain neutral or long positions and few speculative players are willing to take the short side of the market. Hedge funds and other money managers have accumulated bullish long positions betting on a further rise in prices amounting to almost 1.2 billion barrels of oil. At the same time, the number of short positions in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts has fallen to its lowest level since before 2013. The imbalance between bullish and bearish positions is close to a record, an analysis of regulatory and exchange data showed. Lopsided positioning has often been the precursor to a sharp reversal in the price trend when fund managers attempt to realise profits by closing some positions. The impact of lopsided positioning on the evolution of prices has been explored by researchers including the physicist Didier Sornette (“Why stock markets crash: critical events in complex financial systems”, 2017). But while lopsided positioning is a key signal for a future price reversal it does not indicate how quickly that reversal will take place and at what price level it will occur. In 2007/08, oil prices continued trending higher for some months, even as analysts warned they had become unsustainable. Oil prices tend to overshoot on the upside (2008 and 2011) just as they have done on the downside (1998, 2009 and 2016) before correcting. Typically, prices peak only once there is clear evidence of a slowdown in oil consumption growth and/or OPEC producers come under intense political pressure to increase production.

2018-10-04,"OSLO (Reuters) - Risk levels in Nasdaq’s (NDAQ.O) Nordic commodities market had more than doubled in the six months prior to a top trader’s default in November, the result of a rapid accumulation of bets amid soaring electricity prices, the exchange told Reuters. Nasdaq conducts daily stress tests calculating market risk, adjusting every quarter a member-funded buffer to shield the market from breaking down in case of defaults like the one that caused a 114 million euro ($132 million) loss in September. But the stress tests, which are not made available to traders, may be insufficient, some of them told Reuters, asking for more transparency and better risk control. On March 1, the default fund amounted to just 74 million euros. Had the level stayed unchanged, Einar Aas, the trader who defaulted, would have hit the market with a loss the buffers couldn’t match, triggering a deeper crisis. Seeing higher risk levels, Nasdaq on June 1 increased clearing members’ default fund requirement to 133 million euros, and on Sept. 1 upped it again to 166 million euros. These were the only two occasions on which members were warned of the increased risk Nasdaq identified prior to the default, aside from regular market notices. “The increase in stress values was primarily driven by two factors: a general increase in the price levels in the power markets which directly feed into increased stress numbers, and increased underlying exposure (increased size of positions) among the members,” Nasdaq said. Aas had triggered alerts in the stress tests due to his large positions but was not the only trader to do so, it added. Investors had significantly increased their positions over six months, Nasdaq said, and while the size itself was no cause for concern, it coincided with a fall in liquidity, making it hard for individual traders to exit positions. On Sept. 10, when spreads between Nordic and German power contracts widened sharply, an event Nasdaq later described as a “black swan”, Aas was unable to unload his portfolio. A systemic collapse was avoided, Nasdaq said, thanks to the stress tests that caused the buffer’s readjustment. Betting that Nordic-German spreads would shrink - the opposite of what happened - had been common, traders said. Others avoided big losses as they managed to close their positions due to their smaller size. “We had a position that included the spread that we closed one week before what happened ... It should come together but it continued to widen. If you are a trader you either put more money in it or you sell,” portfolio manager Per Svenonius at Sweden’s Modity Energy said. But while more defaults were avoided, traders said they were unhappy with Nasdaq’s handling of the matter and level of transparency, and that the exchange had underestimated risk. BKK, Norway’s second-largest power firm as measured by retail customer base, told Reuters: “The incident shows that Nasdaq’s risk assessments for individual participants are insufficient.”  Sweden’s Sheperd Energy called for stricter rules, saying Nasdaq had miscalculated risk. “It is not OK for Nasdaq to have one player holding about 50 percent of the open interest in (the contract for) Q1 2019. It is very dangerous,” portfolio manager Arne Oesterlind said. “They have to make better stress tests,” he added. Following the default, Nordic regulators launched investigations that are still ongoing, while Nasdaq imposed stricter collateral demands. Asked whether Nasdaq was considering publishing stress tests daily, a Nasdaq spokesman said: “We are considering our actions in our current review of the situation.” Previously Nasdaq said it was considering reshaping maximum allowed positions per member. Einar Aas did not respond to requests for comment. (This story corrects penultimate paragraph to show Nasdaq’s position on further action to take.)

2018-10-04,"PARIS (Reuters) - French solar company Neoen is targeting a market capitalization of 1.4-1.5 billion euros ($1.6-$1.7 billion) in an initial public offering (IPO) to fund its international expansion.  The IPO will make Neoen one of the few pure-play listed renewable energy operators in Europe, along with Portugal’s EDPR (EDPR.LS), Denmark’s Orsted (ORSTED.CO), Norway’s Scatec Solar (SSOL.OL) and France’s Voltalia (VLTSA.PA). Neoen, the largest independent French renewable energy firm competing with market leaders EDF (EDF.PA) and Engie (ENGIE.PA), will raise 450 million euros of new capital while two fund shareholders will sell existing shares worth 190 million euros, for a total offer of 640 million euros worth of shares.  Neoen chief executive Xavier Barbaro said the new cash would be used to finance renewable energy development projects in the next two to three years, but not for acquisitions. “An IPO is a good tool to accelerate our growth but we do not depend on it for financing,” Barbaro told reporters. The new shares will be priced at 16 to 19 euros per share and the offer will run from Oct. 4-15. The price will be fixed on Oct. 16 and formal trading will start on Oct. 19, with a free float of an estimated 30 percent of Neoen stock. Majority shareholder Impala will buy about 170 million euros worth of shares in order to retain a majority stake, but if demand is high, current shareholders including Impala and Bpifrance may offer additional shares that could boost the total offer to 711.5 million euros. Barbaro said Impala, which earlier this year sold its minority stake in listed power retailer Direct Energie to Total (TOTF.PA), had no intention of selling Neoen. “We are totally the kind of beauty that would attract big utilities or oil firms who want to go into renewables... but the choice to remain independent is clear and is assumed by our lead shareholder,” Barbaro said.     Neoen has installed capacity of 2,000 megawatts (MW), two thirds solar, one third in wind.  “Our future is in solar, that is where costs are dropping most rapidly,” Barbaro said.  Neoen has another 1,000 MW under development and will invest 2.9 billion euros - funded by project-related debt - to reach capacity of 5,000 MW installed or under construction by 2021.  Unlike many renewable energy developers, Neoen keeps full ownership of its projects and earns money by selling power to countries, utilities and companies through long-term contracts.   Barbaro said Neoen will continue to focus on OECD countries where it can sign deals in euros and dollars, preferably smaller countries where it can be market leader.  It currently has about 1,000 MW installed in Australia, 700 MW in Europe and Africa and 200 MW in the Americas, including Mexico, Jamaica and Argentina.  Last year, Neoen partnered with Tesla (TSLA.O) to install the world’s biggest battery in Australia.

2018-10-04,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - A rise in U.S. Treasury yields to their highest levels since mid-2011 pulled global bond yields higher across the board and boosted the dollar on Thursday, while stocks sagged in response. An influential survey of the U.S. services sector showed activity at its strongest since August 1997, sparking speculation that the payrolls report on Friday could also surprise. Comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that economic outlook was “remarkably positive” and that rates might rise above “neutral” also helped the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury climb to 3.18 percent on Wednesday. Yields extended those gains on Thursday, having spiked to 3.2325 percent overnight, posting their steepest daily increase since the shock outcome of the U.S. presidential election in November 2016. It last traded at 3.2135 percent. “The market is pricing in an additional 0.47 percent of rate increases in 2019 (nearly two hikes) compared to the Fed’s median projection of 0.75 percent (three hikes),” wrote Bill Merz, Minneapolis-based director of fixed income at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “The difference in market versus Fed expectations must be reconciled via lower Fed expectations or the higher market expectations. We anticipate further upward pressure on bond yields, because the Fed is unlikely to waver materially from its near-term path.” The rise in U.S. yields helped lift yields across Asia and Europe in response, while shares in emerging markets slipped. Higher U.S. yields are anything but favourable for emerging markets as they tend to draw away much-needed foreign funds while pressuring local currencies. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan skidded 1.7 percent, with South Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia and Taiwan all down. Even the Nikkei eased half a percent, as rising yields offset the boost to exporters from a weaker yen. EMini futures for the S&P 500 also lost 0.4 percent in European trade, while European stocks last traded down 0.7 percent. Euro zone bond yields rose sharply, tracking their U.S. counterpart, while the “trans-Atlantic spread” between United States and German 10-year bond yields hit a three-decade high of around 275 bps. Germany’s 10-year bond yield, the benchmark for the region, hit a 4-1/2 month high of 0.55 percent before settling at around 0.53 percent, still up six basis points on the day. “If the Fed is to hike rates beyond the neutral level, the underlying case is that the economy is doing very well - and if the U.S. economy is doing very well, that has spillover effects the euro zone,” said DZ Bank analyst Rene Albrecht. “This will make it easier for the ECB to raise rates in 2019; and you will see this impact yields in the euro zone, especially at the long end,” he added. The exception of the day was Italy, where borrowing costs dropped for a second day, after the government said it would cut budget deficit targets from 2020 and reduce its debt over the next three years. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Wednesday confirmed a deficit target of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019 and said this would fall to 2.1 percent in 2020 and 1.8 percent in 2021. The estimates for 2020 and 2021 were lower than those initially reported, bringing further relief to bond markets rattled by the new government’s plans to ramp up spending. Italy’s two-year bond yield was last down 2 basis points at 1.234 percent. In currencies, the dollar gave up some of the gains that took it to a six-week high against a basket of peers, to stand up 0.1 percent on the day. Oil prices slipped from four-year highs, pressured by rising U.S. inventories and after sources said Russia and Saudi Arabia struck a private deal in September to raise crude output. Brent eased 0.2 percent to $86.13 a barrel on Thursday, while U.S. crude also fell 0.1 percent to $76.28 a barrel. Gold prices moved in a narrow range, last trading up 0.3 percent at $1.200.52 per ounce.

2018-10-04,"(Adds details on commissioning of Flamanville EPR reactor) PARIS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - French Ecology Minister Francois de Rugy said on Thursday the closure of the country’s oldest nuclear plant at Fessenheim was not conditional on the start-up of a new reactor that utility EDF is building, and that it would be decommissioned by 2022. The French government had previously tied the shutdown of Fessenheim’s two 900-megawatt (MW) reactors to the commissioning of the new generation EPR Flamanville 3 reactor that EDF is building in Normandy. “The (Fessenheim) plant will close during this presidential mandate, which runs until 2022,” de Rugy told francinfo radio. De Rugy said EDF had been unable give any clarity on when Flamanville’s new EPR reactor would come online. In July, problems with weldings forced the company to push back the start-up date again to the second quarter of 2020. On Wednesday, French nuclear regulator ASN said faulty weldings at the plant could require more repairs than originally estimated. “Today, no one can say for sure when Flamanville will start and be operational,” de Rugy said. Former president Francois Hollande’s Socialist government signed a decree in April 2017 stating that the Fessenheim nuclear power plant would halt power production by April 2020 once Flamanville 3 was operational. “EDF is not able to give us a start-up date for Flamanville, neither is the Nuclear Safety Authority,” de Rugy said. The uncertainty meant the government now held the view the closure of Fessenheim and the start-up of Flamanville could not happen at the same time, he said. France - which produces 75 percent of its electricity in the nuclear reactors of state-owned utility EDF - will decide in coming weeks on a new long-term energy strategy, which will include reducing the share of nuclear to 50 percent, but so far no deadline has been set for that target.

2018-10-04,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Small Canadian oil producers are striking complex deals with refineries, diversifying production and seeking marketing help as they try to soften the blow from record price discounts on heavy crude generated by pipeline congestion. Unlike integrated companies Suncor Energy and Imperial Oil that have refineries to process their own oil, reserved pipeline space, storage, and marketing departments, small producers scrape by with less. That reality is spurring companies such as Pengrowth Energy Corp, Athabasca Oil Corp, and Gear Energy Ltd to find new strategies. Canadian heavy crude sells for less than half the price of the U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) light oil, with the differential reaching the widest level ever on Friday, according to Shorcan Energy Brokers. The price for light oil is also under pressure. Being small especially hurts when barrels are rejected by pipeline companies that do not have capacity to move all the crude produced, called apportionment. Small producers are then forced into finding new last-minute buyers, shaving a further $5 to $10 per barrel off already deeply discounted prices, said Rob Morgan, chief executive of private heavy oil producer Cona Resources. “The small to mid-size companies are going to have to step up their game,” said Jihad Traya, Calgary-based manager of strategic energy advisory services at HSB Solomon Associates. “What it comes down to now is, how clever can you be?” Fourteen percent of Western Canadian crude in 2017 was produced by companies with output of 50,000 boepd or less, not including private companies, according to a Canadian Energy Research Institute calculation using CanOils data. A vibrant junior sector is critical for the role it plays exploring boundaries of hydrocarbon pools, said Mark Oberstoetter, director of upstream research at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. While the differentials hurt, they are based off rising WTI prices, which has allowed some small producers to stay profitable, he said. More small Canadian oil producers are making sales to refineries that lock in a fixed price for the differential, allowing them to limit risk, Traya said. U.S. refiners, who benefit from the big discount, get to lock in supplies long-term. Pengrowth agreed to sell most of its 2018 crude production, 17,000 barrels per day, and 40 percent of next year’s output, 10,000 bpd, to two U.S. refineries at a fixed differential. Pengrowth also gains access to the refineries’ pipeline space. The company is now trying to lock in more of its 2019 and 2020 production on that basis, said Pengrowth CEO Pete Sametz. “It’s apportionment protection.” Athabasca is also mitigating the impact of apportionment through contracts with refineries that involve pipeline space, CEO Rob Broen said in a presentation. For some small producers, outside marketing expertise is more important than ever. Phoenix Energy Marketing has doubled the volume of crude it markets in the past three years, to 50,000 barrels per day, said president Dave Maffitt. “You know you’re going to take a haircut on price. It’s just minimizing the haircut and being knowledgeable enough about what the alternatives might be,” Maffitt said. But not all strategies are successful, and many refiners are hesitant to lock in differentials when the widening trend boosts their margins, said a Canadian industry source. “The best barrel (to buy) is the distressed barrel,” he said. One fixed-differential deal collapsed between a U.S. East Coast refiner and Canadian producer due to restrictions on older, widely used rail cars, a source at the refiner said, showing that there is no easy way around transport bottlenecks. To diversify from selling heavy crude, Gear Energy announced in July it would buy light oil assets in Saskatchewan. Since announcing the deal, however, the light oil discount has risen sharply. Gear is now likely to cut capital spending, said Chief Financial Officer David Hwang.

2018-10-04,"(Repeats with no changes) By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Amanda Cooper NEW YORK/LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Oil traders have piled into wagers that U.S. crude oil could surge to $100 a barrel by next year, a milestone that until recently many considered unthinkable due to record U.S. production growth and relatively flat global demand. But the imminent return of U.S. sanctions on Iran and bottlenecks keeping U.S. oil from getting to market have fueled a rally that has taken benchmark oil prices to four-year highs. While big producing nations say supply is ample, hedge funds and speculators are increasingly skeptical of that argument, betting the market could rally further as sanctions on Iran’s crude exports return on Nov. 4. The bullishness is visible in the U.S. options market.  The number of open positions on $100 December 2019 WTI call options - bets on futures hitting that price by the end of 2019 - has risen by 30 percent in the last week to a record 31,000 lots, according to CME data. “Over the last two weeks, there’s been a lot more evidence that even some of the larger customers - India and China - are not going to be buying Iranian crude from November,” said John Saucer, vice president of research and analysis at Mobius Risk Group. As a result, he said, “these sanctions are likely to be a lot more effective than people even thought.” Overall exports from Iran have dropped to 2 million barrels per day (bpd) in September from 2.8 million bpd in April, the Institute of International Finance said. Estimates for how much of Iran’s exports could be affected range from 500,000 bpd to 2 million bpd, and uncertainty over the impact could ultimately foster price swings in either direction. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose above $86 a barrel on Wednesday, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) U.S. crude hit $76 a barrel, both four-year highs. The Trump administration’s decision to renew sanctions on Iran prompted a sharp shift from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. After about 18 months of restraining supply, OPEC agreed to increase output. Further, Saudi Arabia and Russia recently agreed privately to boost supply before telling other OPEC countries in an effort to mollify U.S. President Donald Trump, who has focused his anger on rising prices. Oil markets are looking to OPEC and Russia to make up shortfalls in supply. U.S. production, which sits at a record 11.1 million bpd, cannot replace Middle East crudes, such as Iranian grades, in Asian refineries. In addition, transportation bottlenecks are constraining U.S. output. “We continue to see price risks tilted to the upside and do not rule out a spike in oil prices to $100/barrel,” UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said. Open interest in $100 December 2018 Brent call options , which expire in late October, is currently more than 50,000 lots, more than any other strike price for that month, according to InterContinental Exchange data. Implied volatility for very bullish Brent options that expire after the Nov. 4 resumption of sanctions has overtaken that for very bearish options, suggesting increased demand for such bullish bets. This spread, or skew, is at its most bullish since mid July. Open interest in $100 December 2018 WTI calls, which expire in mid-November, has risen to the highest in over four months at about 15,000 lots. Many traders said these $100 bets face long odds. Option contracts used to speculate on far-fetched outcomes tend to be cheap, and if crude’s rally stalls, those positions will expire worthless. But even a short-term jump could make those options more expensive, and holders could sell them for a profit. Reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in New York and Amanda

The rise in oil prices to more than $85 a barrel and concerns over global trade are putting heavy pressure on emerging economies, he said. “Expensive energy is back at a bad time for the global economy,” Birol said. The recent rally in crude prices was driven by concerns over tightening supplies as exports from Iran dropped sharply before the start of renewed U.S. sanctions on Tehran next month. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, and non-member Russia have pledged to boost production.

2018-10-04,"PARIS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Western European car sales dropped 23 percent in September, according to LMC Automotive data, in the wake of a summer discounting splurge that preceded tougher new emissions rules now keeping some models out of showrooms. Registrations fell to 1.05 million cars last month from 1.36 million a year earlier, the consulting firm said on Thursday. Its numbers are based on national sales data and estimates for some of the smallest markets. The new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test (WLTP) became mandatory on Sept. 1, forcing carmakers including Volkswagen and Renault to halt deliveries of some models that had yet to be re-certified. “The factors affecting the market are multifaceted, with backlogs in cars being tested under WLTP leading to the removal from sale of several popular models,” said LMC analyst David Oakley. VW and Renault had led an August sales surge, as automakers boosted discounts and registrations of their own vehicles to be sold on the used car market. In September, the seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR) of Western European sales plunged 39 percent to 11.26 million cars, LMC said - adding that VW model approval delays had contributed to market declines in Germany and the UK. Sales fell 30.5 percent in Germany, 20.5 percent in Britain, 12.8 percent in France and 25.4 percent in Italy, according to data published in recent days.

The exception of the day was Italy, where borrowing costs dropped for a second day, after the government said it would cut budget deficit targets from 2020 and reduce its debt over the next three years. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Wednesday confirmed a deficit target of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019 and said this would fall to 2.1 percent in 2020 and 1.8 percent in 2021. The estimates for 2020 and 2021 were lower than those initially reported, bringing further relief to bond markets rattled by the new government’s plans to ramp up spending. Italy’s two-year bond yield was last down 2 basis points at 1.19 percent. In currencies, the dollar was near a six-week high against a basket of peers, holding most of its gains on the back of Thursday’s U.S. services sector survey. Oil prices slipped from four-year highs, pressured by rising U.S. inventories and after sources said Russia and Saudi Arabia struck a private deal in September to raise crude output. Brent eased 0.1 percent to $86.20 a barrel on Thursday, while U.S. crude also fell 0.1 percent to $76.35 a barrel. Gold prices moved in a narrow range, last trading up 0.2 percent at $1.199.43 per ounce.

2018-10-04,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates will soon sign an agreement to provide up to $10 billion (£7.7 billion) of financial support to Bahrain, Kuwait’s Al Rai newspaper said on Thursday, quoting an unnamed Gulf diplomatic source. The agreement will be signed in Bahrain after the ministers complete their current visit to Jordan, where they are concluding a financial aid deal for that country, the newspaper reported. “A Gulf decision at the highest levels was taken to start the execution steps for a programme to support the financial stability of Bahrain,” the diplomatic source was quoted as saying. Bahrain’s international bond prices and currency have come under pressure this year as the kingdom runs fiscal and current account deficits partly caused by low oil prices.  Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE, which are diplomatic allies of Bahrain, announced in June that they were in talks on a major aid package for the kingdom that would be linked to its progress in reforming its finances. Sources in Bahrain told Reuters last month that the government planned to push reforms through parliament before Nov. 24 elections to the assembly. These include the imposition of value-added tax and changes to the pension system, Al Rai did not give details of the aid package. Sources previously told Reuters that it would extend over several years.  A $10 billion package would be worth about a quarter of Bahrain’s annual gross domestic product and 28 percent of public debt, and cover over two years of state budget deficits according to International Monetary Fund projections. It would put no significant strain on the combined finances of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE, which have hundreds of billions of dollars in their sovereign wealth funds and with Brent oil trading above $80 a barrel, have seen their own deficits narrow sharply or disappear in recent months.

The agreed price, which serves as an industry benchmark for supplies of seaborne thermal coal in Asia, was 16 percent higher than the contract for the year through September this year. Glencore has two annual supply contracts with Japanese utilities but talks with Tohoku Electric on supplies for April 2018-March 2019 broke down earlier this year, forcing other utilities to set their own prices in the opaque market. Both companies declined to comment on the latest talks. Australian spot thermal coal prices have traded around six-year highs in recent months, pushed up by a summer heatwave across the northern hemisphere as well as output cuts in China, the world’s biggest consumer of coal. With annual imports of around 115 million tonnes, Japan is one of the world’s biggest importers of thermal coal. Its utilities buy about 40 percent of all Australian exports of the commodity. But volumes under long-term contract have been declining as utilities try to diversify supply sources and trade more in the spot market as part of Japan’s energy market liberalisation.

2018-10-04,"* Exchange delayed launch of electricity futures in July * Spot price volatility driving demand for futures, CEO says * New rubber contract will attract Thai producers, Chinese buyers By Aaron Sheldrick and Yuka Obayashi TOKYO, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) may start trading of its electric power futures contract as early as January, part of an effort to return to profitability by expanding its product listings, its chief executive officer said on Wednesday. In March 2016, Japan opened its electric power sector to competition causing the country’s utilities to embrace more spot power trading, with volumes on the Japan Electric Power Exchange more than quadrupling. The demand for power futures on TOCOM to help utilities to manage the price volatility that has followed the spot trading surge may help the exchange reverse three years of losses incurred amid stiff competition with futures markets in China and Singapore. “The (spot) market is too volatile, especially in the summer and winter,” said TOCOM Chief Executive Officer Takamichi Hamada said in an interview, pointing to a need for new power suppliers to be able to hedge in the futures market. A sweltering summer drove prices on the Japan Electric Power Exchange to just above 100 yen ($0.90) per kilowatt hour in July, the highest on record, as new entrants scrambled to meet the demand for cooling. TOCOM delayed the launch of the electricity futures in July as utilities and other market participants needed more time to get their systems in place. Hamada wants the new futures contract to be running by January to have two months of settlement before the end of the financial year in March. TOCOM reported a third straight year of losses for the 2017/18 financial year, but Hamada is hopeful that the new products will help it turn to profitable this year. “Cost cut, marketing to broaden participants and new contracts are the three key pillars to turn us around,” he said. Last financial year, TOCOM’s total trading volumes were 24 million contracts, only about a quarter of the record 87 million contracts traded in 2003. TOCOM also plans to boost trading volumes by adding a new rubber product, Hamada said, a market where the exchange has been active since the 1950s. On Oct. 9, TOCOM will launch new technically specified rubber (TSR) futures to meet growing demand for the product. The exchange’s existing ribbed smoked sheet (RSS) futures have been a benchmark for the Asian rubber market since they were first offered in 1952. However, rubber consumers, particularly tyre-makers, have started to prefer TSR, which is largely machine produced and is considered a more consistent product, to the smoked sheets, which are put together by hand and can have some variance in quality. TOCOM’s new TSR contract will be for physical delivery on a Free on Board (FOB) basis at two ports in Thailand and one in Malaysia. Trading in TSR futures on the Singapore Exchange tripled between 2014 and 2017 while TOCOM’s RSS contract volumes have fallen by more than a tenth. “Singapore’s TSR is mainly linked with the Indonesian product, but our TSR meets the product standard in Thailand, the world’s biggest natural rubber producer,” Hamada said, adding that it will likely attract Thai producers and shippers as well as buyers in China, the world’s biggest rubber consumer, for hedging and arbitrage. The Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) has bypassed TOCOM on rubber futures volumes, with ShFE’s turnover in 2017 of 89 million contracts 42 times higher than the Japanese exchange’s volumes.

2018-10-04,"* Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Dollar holds gains, nears major chart barrier on yen * Market pricing in more aggressive Fed on strong US data * 10-year Treasury yields highest since 2011 at 3.22 pct * Asian stocks stagger as borrowing costs rise By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The dollar scored an 11-month top on the yen on Thursday as stunningly strong U.S. economic data drove Treasury yields to their highest since May 2011, while Asian stocks were sideswiped by rising borrowing costs at home. Higher U.S. yields are anything but favourable for emerging markets as they tend to draw away much-needed foreign funds while pressuring local currencies. Bond prices fell across Asia and long-term Japanese yields reached ground not visited since early 2016, a market tightening not warranted by domestic economic conditions. “A simple dynamic is playing out in the global economy right now - the U.S. is booming, while most of the rest of the world slows or even stagnates,” said HSBC economist Kevin Logan. “A Federal Reserve that is raising rates to prevent the U.S. economy from overheating is constraining the policy options of countries where financial conditions are tightening and trade tensions intensifying.” MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan skidded 1.7 percent in response, with South Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia and Taiwan all down. Even the Nikkei eased 0.3 percent, as rising yields offset the boost to exporters from a weaker yen. EMini futures for the S&P 500 also lost 0.4 percent in Asian trade, while European bourses were seen starting mixed. The dollar had taken off after an influential survey of the U.S. services sector showed activity at its strongest since August 1997, sparking speculation the payrolls report on Friday could also surprise. “The (ISM) index was significantly above the long-term average during periods of growth and consistent with the upside risks to growth,” said Kevin Cummins, senior U.S. economist at NatWest Markets. “At a minimum, these data suggest that labour demand remains very strong.” Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell declared the economic outlook was “remarkably positive” and said rates might rise above “neutral”, currently anywhere from 2.5 to 3 percent. A Fed hike in December is now put at an 8 in 10 chance, while investors lifted expectations for how high rates may eventually go. Fed fund futures for December 2019 sank to a contract low of 97.095, implying a rate of 2.905 percent. At the start of this year they had looked for only 2.1 percent. Yields on 10-year Treasury debt were up at 3.225 percent, having spiked 12 basis points overnight. That was the steepest daily increase since the shock outcome of the U.S. presidential election in November 2016. The jump in yields boosted financial shares on Wednesday, putting the S&P 500 within striking distance of a record. The Dow rose 0.2 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.07 percent and the Nasdaq 0.32 percent. The groundswell of economic optimism swept the U.S. dollar to a six-week high on a basket of currencies and it was last trading up 0.34 percent at 96.086. The gains were broad based with the euro falling back to $1.1471 after being as high as $1.1593 on Wednesday. The dollar shot to its highest so far this year on the yen at 114.55 before steadying at 114.40. It was now threatening a major peak from November 2017 at 114.735. In Asia, the Indian rupee and Indonesian rupiah have been under heavy fire, in part because both countries are being squeezed by the soaring cost of imported oil. Oil prices have reached four-year peaks as the market focused on upcoming U.S. sanctions on Iran while shrugging off the year’s largest weekly build in U.S. crude stockpiles. Brent eased 17 cents to $86.12 a barrel on Thursday, while U.S. crude fell 15 cents to $76.26.

2018-10-04,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Oil traders have piled into wagers that U.S. crude oil could surge to $100 a barrel by next year, a milestone that until recently many considered unthinkable due to record U.S. production growth and relatively flat global demand. But the imminent return of U.S. sanctions on Iran and bottlenecks keeping U.S. oil from getting to market have fueled a rally that has taken benchmark oil prices to four-year highs.  While big producing nations say supply is ample, hedge funds and speculators are increasingly skeptical of that argument, betting the market could rally further as sanctions on Iran’s crude exports return on Nov. 4.  The bullishness is visible in the U.S. options market.  The number of open positions on $100 December 2019 WTI call options CL1000L9 - bets on futures hitting that price by the end of 2019 - has risen by 30 percent in the last week to a record 31,000 lots, according to CME data.  “Over the last two weeks, there’s been a lot more evidence that even some of the larger customers - India and China - are not going to be buying Iranian crude from November,” said John Saucer, vice president of research and analysis at Mobius Risk Group.  As a result, he said, “these sanctions are likely to be a lot more effective than people even thought.”    Overall exports from Iran have dropped to 2 million barrels per day (bpd) in September from 2.8 million bpd in April, the Institute of International Finance said.  Estimates for how much of Iran’s exports could be affected range from 500,000 bpd to 2 million bpd, and uncertainty over the impact could ultimately foster price swings in either direction. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose above $86 a barrel on Wednesday, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) U.S. crude hit $76 a barrel, both four-year highs. The Trump administration’s decision to renew sanctions on Iran prompted a sharp shift from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. After about 18 months of restraining supply, OPEC agreed to increase output. Further, Saudi Arabia and Russia recently agreed privately to boost supply before telling other OPEC countries in an effort to mollify U.S. President Donald Trump, who has focused his anger on rising prices. Oil markets are looking to OPEC and Russia to make up shortfalls in supply. U.S. production, which sits at a record 11.1 million bpd, cannot replace Middle East crudes, such as Iranian grades, in Asian refineries. In addition, transportation bottlenecks are constraining U.S. output. “We continue to see price risks tilted to the upside and do not rule out a spike in oil prices to $100/barrel,” UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.  Open interest in $100 December 2018 Brent call options LCO10000L8, which expire in late October, is currently more than 50,000 lots, more than any other strike price for that month, according to InterContinental Exchange data. (For a graphic on 'Traders bet on $100 oil as Iran sanctions approach' click reut.rs/2Oy7mvY) Implied volatility for very bullish Brent options that expire after the Nov. 4 resumption of sanctions has overtaken that for very bearish options, suggesting increased demand for such bullish bets. This spread, or skew, is at its most bullish since mid July. Open interest in $100 December 2018 WTI calls CL1000L8, which expire in mid-November, has risen to the highest in over four months at about 15,000 lots.   Many traders said these $100 bets face long odds. Option contracts used to speculate on far-fetched outcomes tend to be cheap, and if crude’s rally stalls, those positions will expire worthless. But even a short-term jump could make those options more expensive, and holders could sell them for a profit.

2018-10-04,"MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The financial squeeze on India’s farmers is set to worsen because of record high fuel prices and surging costs of fertilisers, posing a challenge to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an election that must be held by May. The rise in input prices could not have come at worse time for farmers, already grappling with falling domestic product prices due to rising yields and abundant harvests. Yet, the government has few easy options to respond. Rival global producers have complained about Indian state support and falling global farm product prices undermine export prospects. Indian farmers voted overwhelmingly for Modi in 2014. But a fall in rural incomes risks damaging that support next year. Thousands of farmers marched on New Delhi on Tuesday to demand better prices for their produce. Police responded with teargas and water cannon. Farmers suspended their protests after talks with officials that ran into early Wednesday morning. But their demands and those of other agriculture workers, who together make up about half India’s 1.3 billion people, have not gone away. [nL4N1WI2LX] “Although we have decided to end our protest, we still believe that the government is not serious about addressing the concerns of the farmers,” Anil Talan, national secretary of farmers body Bhartiya Kisan Union, said after the march. Diesel prices have surged 26 percent this year, making tilling fields, harvesting and transporting crops expensive for India’s 263 million farmers who mostly use diesel tractors. Alongside rising diesel costs, prices of key fertilisers such as potash and phosphate have jumped nearly 15 and 17 percent respectively in a year, as companies pass on the rise in global prices and the impact of the weak rupee to farmers. India, the world’s second-biggest producer of staples such as rice and wheat, imports all its potash needs and relies on foreign supplies for nearly 90 percent of the phosphate it uses. “It’s a double whammy for farmers who have to bear the brunt of lower crop prices and higher input costs,” said Devinder Sharma, an independent food and trade policy analyst, saying this explained “why farmers’ anger has come to the fore.” Diesel demand is rising as farmers have started harvesting summer crops. After tilling, they will plant wheat and rapeseed, the main winter crops. Union official Talan said the government needed to prop up commodity prices and keep a lid on farmers’ costs to support the agricultural industry, which accounts for about 16 percent of India’s $2.6 trillion (£2 trillion) economy. Graphic: Oil prices in different currencies (tmsnrt.rs/2N67zl9) “Because of higher diesel prices I need to spend nearly 20 percent more on harvesting soybean but soybean prices have crashed this year,” said Uttam Jagdale, a farmer from Pune, about 150 km (94 miles) south of Mumbai. Nilesh Sable, a cane farmer from Sangli in the western state of Maharashtra, said fertiliser prices were rising each month. Fertiliser firms say they have little choice but to pass on at least some extra costs due to a sharp fall in the rupee and a 20 percent rise in international potash and phosphate prices. “Still, we are not passing the entire burden to farmers,” said an official with a state-run fertiliser company, asking not to be named in line with government policy. Greater farm efficiency is partly to blame. Mechanised farming, high-yielding seed varieties and increased use of pesticides have pushed up harvests. Output of most crops has soared to record levels each year.     India’s production of pulses, such as lentils and beans, surged to 24.51 million tonnes in the year to June 2018, up from 23.13 million tonnes in the previous 12 months. Imports of pulses, such as lentils from Canada, Australia and Russia, fell to 1.2 million tonnes in the financial year to March 2019, the lowest since 2000/01 and well below the 6.6 million tonnes imported in 2016/17 after back-to-back failures in the monsoon. Plentiful supplies extend to other crops. India is set to surpass Brazil as the world’s top sugar producer in the 2018/19 season, but rising output has driven down local sugar prices by 15 percent and left mills nursing losses.  In bid to help the sector, the government unveiled measures last week such as transport subsidies and incentives to export at least 5 million tonnes of sugar. Brazil, Thailand, Australia and other rival producers were quick to complain. [nL4N1WC3I7] Vegetable prices, especially onions, cabbage and tomatoes, have also fallen 25 percent from last year, largely because of overproduction. Without enough refrigerated trucks, excess production cannot be stored. Domestic milk prices dived more than 25 percent in the past year, but a global glut has made Indian exports uncompetitive.

2018-10-04,"PORTLAND, Oregon, Oct 4 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Three years ago, a group of eighth graders came before Portland’s City Council to ask for something unusual: a ban on new facilities to transport or store fossil fuels in the city. Quoting Dr. Seuss, singing Bob Dylan’s “The Times They Are A Changing” and performing a short play set 200 years in the future, they told the officials fossil fuels had no place in a world struggling with climate change - or in Portland’s future. Later that day, city officials unanimously voted for the first-in-the-nation ban. “This is the first stone in a green wall of resistance against fossil fuel facilities on the West Coast,” promised then-Mayor Charlie Hales, who heralded the ordinance as an example of how cities can take action against climate change. Today, more than 70 cities around the world - including green-leaning Portland - have pledged to become “carbon neutral” by 2050, meaning they will eliminate nearly all fossil fuel emissions and offset what they cannot, through actions such as planting carbon-absorbing trees. Each city is pushing toward the goal in its own way, to help meet the emissions-cutting goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which aim to hold off the worst impacts of global warming, from fiercer storms to more frequent crop failures. But the road to becoming a “zero carbon city” is rarely a simple or easy one, as Portland has discovered. After passing its landmark policy, which banned construction of new, large-scale fossil fuel facilities in the city, Portland was hit by a legal challenge from petroleum trade groups and a local business coalition The groups argued the city had overstepped its constitutional bounds by effectively blocking interstate commerce, an argument the state land use court upheld in July 2017. The city then appealed and won - a decision ultimately upheld by the state Supreme Court in July. “We are disappointed that the Oregon Supreme Court declined to review this case,” said Kara Siepmann, a spokeswoman for the Western States Petroleum Association, one of the original challengers. “This matter remains very important to our industry, the city of Portland, and all Oregonians who rely on terminals for safe and reliable access to fuel,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation via e-mail. The Portland Business Alliance, another challenger, declined to comment. The ruling now clears the way for Portland to put its new law into effect - but only after years of delay. “People in Portland fight to defend what we love from dirty fossil fuel projects like oil train terminals,” said Dan Serres, conservation director for Columbia Riverkeeper, an environmental non-government organization that joined the city’s court appeal. “The city of Portland made history when it adopted the fossil fuel ordinance. With these challenges from the oil industry and the Portland Business Alliance out of the way, Portland can move forward toward putting this policy into practice,” he said. Turning the policy into day-to-day action in the city, however, will bring its own challenges. The ordinance calls for the city council to “actively oppose expansion of infrastructure whose primary purpose is transporting or storing fossil fuels in or through Portland or adjacent waterways”. Determining what projects do that is up to the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability. It has modified the city’s zoning code to restrict what it calls “bulk fossil fuel terminals” - facilities with the capacity to hold more than 2 million gallons (7.5 million litres) of fuels such as oil, natural gas or propane. Portland doesn’t aim to phase out fossil fuels entirely just yet. While it pledged last year to aim for 100 percent renewable energy - on the day U.S. President Donald Trump said he would withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement - Portland for now still needs existing oil and natural gas distribution networks to heat homes and fuel automobiles. But “we have enough,” Portland city planner Tom Armstrong, who worked on the zoning code, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview. Banning new fossil fuel infrastructure supports the city’s 100 percent renewable pledge and its climate action plan. But it’s also aimed at reducing another risk - from earthquakes. “Climate action issues aside, our port facilities are not located in the best place when it comes to seismic risk,” Armstrong said. When the city studied existing riverfront oil and gas terminals, researchers discovered they all sit on land susceptible to liquefaction - when saturated soil begins acting like a liquid - during an earthquake. With Portland situated near a major 600-mile-long fault zone off the U.S. West Coast, “zoning is about ensuring public health and safety and that’s what we’re trying to do in Portland,” Armstrong said. “No one wants a fossil fuel terminal exploding in their backyard,” Mia Reback of 350PDX, the local chapter of a climate activist organisation, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The constellation of oil tanks, propane terminals and liquid natural gas plants along Portland’s Willamette River lies just a few miles from the city’s downtown, with its trendy food trucks and artisanal doughnut shops. Serres - and city planner Armstrong - say they have noticed an increase in oil trains moving through the city, some carrying fuel from Canada’s Alberta tar sands bound for ships to Asia and elsewhere. Serres believes Portland’s geography at the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia rivers - along the flattest route between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Ocean - makes it uniquely positioned to slow down worldwide distribution of fossil fuels. “We sit between large international markets overseas in Asia and globally significant fossil fuel reserves in the middle of the North American continent,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Armstrong does not see the city’s role as disrupting that flow of commerce, “but we do have a say in how land gets used in our city,” he said. Portland is not the only city looking at the question. Vancouver, a city on the north side of the Columbia River, in the state of Washington, banned bulk oil terminals in 2016. Other deep-water ports along the lower Columbia are also considering whether to accept facilities ranging from coal terminals to methanol refineries - but so far Portland has taken the strongest line against them. “The Portland ordinance was the first time we saw a municipality take a big, affirmative step to say no, we’re going to move in a different direction,” Serres said. Allowing the expansion of fossil fuel facilities could add cash from property taxes and business license fees to Portland’s coffers. But Armstrong said he does not think the ban will have a significant financial impact on the city. What is more worrisome is the relatively slow progress toward the city’s 100 percent renewable energy pledge, local climate activists say. They are pushing a citizen’s initiative on the November election ballot that would tax businesses to create a $30 million annual clean energy fund for the city. The money would pay to install rooftop solar arrays, weatherize homes, and offer job training in green energy fields. “This is not yet reality - and is only a piece of what’s needed from the city,” said 350PDX’s Anais Tupeker.

2018-10-04,"* Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Dollar holds gains, nears major chart barrier on yen * Market pricing in more aggressive Fed on strong US data * 10-year Treasury yields highest since 2011 at 3.19 pct * Asian stocks stumble as borrowing costs rise By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The dollar notched an 11-month top on the yen on Thursday as stunningly strong U.S. economic data drove Treasury yields to their highest since mid-2011, while Asian stocks were pressured as borrowing costs rose at home. Higher U.S. yields are anything but favourable for emerging markets as they tend to draw away much-needed foreign funds while pressuring local currencies. Bond prices fell across Asia and long-term Japanese yields reached ground not visited since early 2016, a market tightening not warranted by domestic economic conditions. “A simple dynamic is playing out in the global economy right now - the U.S. is booming, while most of the rest of the world slows or even stagnates,” said HSBC economist Kevin Logan. “A Federal Reserve that is raising rates to prevent the U.S. economy from overheating is constraining the policy options of countries where financial conditions are tightening and trade tensions intensifying.” MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan skidded 1.1 percent in response, with South Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia and Taiwan all down. Even the Nikkei eased 0.2 percent, as rising yields offset the boost to exporters from a weaker yen. The dollar had taken off after an influential survey of the U.S. services sector showed activity at its strongest since August 1997, sparking speculation the payrolls report on Friday could also surprise. “The (ISM) index was significantly above the long-term average during periods of growth and consistent with the upside risks to growth,” said Kevin Cummins, senior U.S. economist at NatWest Markets. “At a minimum, these data suggest that labour demand remains very strong.” Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell declared the economic outlook was “remarkably positive” and said rates might rise above “neutral”, currently anywhere from 2.5 to 3 percent. A Fed hike in December is now put at an 8 in 10 chance, while investors lifted expectations for how high rates may eventually go. Fed fund futures for December 2019 sank to a contract low of 97.12, implying a rate of 2.88 percent. At the start of this year they had looked for only 2.1 percent. Yields on 10-year Treasury debt were at 3.18 percent, having spiked 12 basis points overnight to the highest since June 2011. It was the steepest daily increase since the shock outcome of the U.S. presidential election in November 2016. The jump in yields boosted financial shares on Wednesday, putting the S&P 500 within striking distance of a record. Financials were also aided by signs Italy would cut its budget deficit and lower its debt, easing concerns that had pressured global stock markets. The Dow rose 0.2 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.07 percent and the Nasdaq 0.32 percent. The groundswell of economic optimism swept the U.S. dollar to a six-week high on a basket of currencies and it was last trading up at 96.085. The gains were broad based with the euro falling back to $1.1471 after being as high as $1.1593 on Wednesday. The dollar shot to its highest so far this year on the yen at 114.55 before steadying at 114.35. It was now threatening a major peak from November 2017 at 114.735. In Asia, the Indian rupee and Indonesian rupiah have been under heavy fire, in part because both countries are being squeezed by the soaring cost of imported oil. Oil prices have reached four-year peaks as the market focused on upcoming U.S. sanctions on Iran while shrugging off the year’s largest weekly build in U.S. crude stockpiles. Brent eased 18 cents to $86.11 a barrel on Thursday, while U.S. crude fell 16 cents to $76.25.

Brent crude oil futures were trading at $85.85 per barrel at 0104 GMT, down 44 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last close. Brent on Wednesday hit a four-year high of $86.74 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 30 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $76.11 a barrel. “Data for last week showed a much more significant than expected ... build in U.S. commercial crude (inventories), which generally suggests that oil prices should tumble,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore. U.S. crude oil stocks C-STK-T-EIA rose by nearly 8 million barrels last week to about 404 million barrels, the biggest increase since March 2017, Energy Information Administration data showed on Wednesday. U.S. weekly Midwest refinery utilization rates dropped to 78.9 percent, their lowest since October 2015, according to the data. Meanwhile, U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA remained at a record-high of 11.1 million barrels per day (bpd). “This on top of the other big news of the day from Riyadh that ... Saudi Arabia and Russia will boost output,” Innes said. Russia and Saudi Arabia struck a private deal in September to raise oil output to cool rising prices, Reuters reported on Wednesday, before consulting with other producers, including the rest of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Russia’s and Saudi Arabia’s actions come as markets have heated up ahead of U.S. sanctions against Iran’s oil sector, which are set to kick in from Nov. 4, and which many analysts expect to knock around 1.5 million bpd of supply out of markets. On the demand side, there is increasing concern that high oil prices and weakening emerging market currencies are creating a toxic inflationary mix that could erode fuel demand and economic growth. “We have been taking a very close look at the demand signals in the market, and what we have been seeing is not good, JBC Energy said on Wednesday in a note to clients. The energy consultancy said it had revised its oil demand forecast downwards amid Brent prices above $80 and diving currencies in many emerging markets, as well as burgeoning product stocks and the ongoing Sino-U.S. trade dispute. “We are not talking about cosmetic changes either. We have cut our forecast for 2018 demand growth by a whopping 300,000 bpd to below 1.1 million bpd,” it said. Reporting by Henning Gloystein
