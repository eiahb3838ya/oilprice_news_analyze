2018-11-07,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is determined to push Iranian oil exports to zero, U.S. Special Representative Brian Hook said on Wednesday, through a ‘calibrated’ approach using maximum economic pressure without lifting oil prices. The United States resumed sanctions on Iran’s oil, shipping and banking industries on Monday after President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal earlier this year. It granted temporary exemptions to eight countries allowing them to continue importing Iranian oil, although it said the ultimate goal is to completely halt exports from Iran. Hook declined to give details of the confidential bilateral deals with the countries, which include China, India, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Greece, Italy and Turkey. The deputy head of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards, Brigadier General Hossein Salami, said on Wednesday that his country can flourish under sanctions and would defeat the United States in the economic war. “We have been very careful about applying maximum economic pressure (on Iran) without lifting the price of oil and we have done that successfully,” Hook told reporters. “We are going to be continuing our path to zero,” Hook said. “We do want to achieve maximum pressure without harming friends or allies and we don’t want to lift the price of oil. ... We have calibrated this very well.” Iran’s exports peaked at 2.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, including 300,000 bpd of condensate, a lighter form of oil. Overall exports have since fallen to 1.8 million bpd, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, which estimates volumes dropping to 1 million bpd. Oil prices in October rallied above $85 per barrel on fears of a steep decline in Iranian exports and have fallen since then. On Wednesday, oil slipped after U.S. crude output hit another record and domestic inventories rose more than expected. [O/R] Asked if the administration had a target in reducing Iranian oil exports in the next six months, Hook said, “I can’t tell you what our target is; we do have a target.” He added that the ultimate aim was to halt Iranian exports entirely. He said the United States expected increased global oil supply in 2019, surpassing demand, which would better position Washington to ask Iranian oil importers to reduce purchases to zero. Washington’s “maximum pressure” strategy would also apply to the escrow accounts holding Iranian oil revenues, Hook said, adding that the Treasury Department would ensure that the accounts are never used for illicit goods. “We will police these very aggressively,” he added. Hook raised the possibility that countries and port operators could face U.S. penalties for facilitating Iran’s “illicit activities” if they allowed Iranian ships access to international waterways and port facilities. Iran regularly shipped “millions of barrels of crude” to Syria in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, he said. Hook said Iranian vessels would lose access to international insurance markets under U.S. sanctions. “From the Suez Canal to the Strait of Malacca and all choke-points in between, Iranian tankers are a floating liability,” Hook said. “Self-insured Iranian tankers are a risk to the ports that permit them to dock, the canals that allow them to transit and the boat that cross their path. This exposes the entire maritime shipping network to immense liability.” Reporting by Lesley Wroughton and Makini Brice; Writing by Humeyra Pamuk; editing by James Dalgleish and Richard Chang",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-sanctions-iran/update-2-u-s-envoy-aims-to-end-iran-oil-exports-without-price-spike-idUKL2N1XI23I,07 Nov 2018,"The United States is

2018-11-07,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Most major stock markets rose on Wednesday, led by a strong rally on Wall Street, after the outcome of the U.S. midterm congressional elections drove expectations of political gridlock in Washington, boosting risk assets and weighing on the dollar. Tuesday’s vote delivered a split U.S. Congress, with Democrats seizing control of the House of Representatives and Republicans strengthening their majority in the Senate. U.S. oil prices fell after U.S. crude output hit another record high. While gridlock could hamper President Donald Trump’s political and economic agenda, few analysts expect a reversal of the tax cuts and financial deregulation measures that have already been enacted.  That view helped Wall’s Street three major equity indexes rally, with traders piling into technology and healthcare stocks. [.N] “I don’t think any of Trump’s agenda that he’s already accomplished gets unwound. That was the main point of concern for investors,” said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas. “We’ve got a relief rally because the market got exactly what it expected.” Still, a split Congress could hamper Trump’s push for a further round of tax cuts and deregulation, measures that have supercharged the U.S. economy, stock markets and the dollar. After the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 545.29 points, or 2.13 percent, to 26,180.3, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 58.44 points, or 2.12 percent, to 2,813.89 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 194.79 points, or 2.64 percent, to 7,570.75. Cannabis-related shares rallied as voters in several U.S. states approved ballot initiatives approving marijuana use, while the resignation of U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has openly opposed legalization, gave investors a further boost. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  rose 1.06 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 1.53 percent. The U.S. Federal Reserve began a two-day monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, and it is expected to keep interest rates unchanged. A rate hike in December is largely priced in. By Wednesday afternoon, the focus was turning to the Fed and the decision of its policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee expected at the close of its meeting on Thursday. “I think traders are squaring positions ahead of tomorrow’s FOMC decision,” said John Doyle, vice president of dealing and trading at Tempus Consulting. The dollar index .DXY fell 0.12 percent, with the euro EUR= unchanged at $1.1426. U.S. Treasury yields fell, but cut their decline after a record high amount of 30-year government bonds was met with weak demand. The Treasury yield curve touched its flattest in over a month US2US10=TWEB. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 6/32 in price to yield 3.2373 percent, from 3.215 percent late on Tuesday.    Attention will now focus on Trump’s hard line on trade tariffs, which he can impose without congressional approval. That keeps alive worries about a trade war between China and the United States. Chinese shares .SSEC closed 0.7 percent lower, while Hong Kong stocks ended up 0.1 percent. .HSI Emerging market stocks rose 0.57 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.61 percent higher, while Japan's Nikkei .N225  closed down 0.3 percent. The dollar's weakness lifted other currencies. Sterling GBP= was last at $1.3128, up 0.24 percent on the day. The Mexican peso MXN= rose overnight as the U.S. election results showed a Democratic majority in the House, but later fell as traders cashed in following four sessions of gains. The Mexican peso lost 0.74 percent versus the U.S. dollar, recently trading at 19.86. U.S. oil prices continued a recent slide after domestic inventories rose more than expected, adding to over-supply concerns as U.S. crude output hit another record high.  U.S. crude CLc1 fell 0.96 percent to $61.61 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was last at $72.02, down 0.15 percent on the day. Spot gold XAU= added 0.1 percent to $1,226.56 an ounce, having earlier hit a high of $1,235.83, while U.S. gold futures GCcv1 settled up $2.40, or 0.20 percent, at $1,228.70.

The company, which partners Royal Dutch Shell Plc in Raízen, the world’s largest sugar producer, said the profit fall was partly due to the lasting impact from a nationwide truckers strike in May, as well as to exchange rate volatility. In the second quarter, Cosan had reported a net loss of 64.3 million reais. “We had a very adverse (third) quarter due to lingering effects of the truckers strike,” said Cosan’s investor relations manager Phillipe Casale. He cited “uncertainty” surrounding diesel subsidies, which were introduced by the government as one of the measures to end the strike, as an example of problems the company still faces.

2018-11-07,"BOGOTA, Nov 7 (Reuters) - The development of non-conventional oil deposits using fracking could generate $500 million per project per year in taxes, royalties, dividends for shareholders and salaries in Colombia, the country’s private oil producers association said on Wednesday. According to an analysis by the Colombian Petroleum Association (ACP), a single fracking project with a typical 30-year lifespan and up to 1,400 wells could generate some 5,000 direct and indirect jobs. “In an environment like this one, where the fiscal sustainability of the national government is not guaranteed, non-conventional deposits represent an opportunity for Colombia to generate the required resources to finance government programs and social development,” ACP President Francisco Lloreda said in a statement. Colombia does not currently carry out oil exploration or exploitation activities with fracking, but an expert commiteee convened by the energy and environmental ministries has begun a study into use of the technique. Results are expected in January. President Ivan Duque has favored fracking, which is used to extract oil and gas from unconventional deposits in rock formations that do not allow the movement of fluid, despite opposition from local communities and environmentalists. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, technology fractures rock formations with pressurized liquid. Its use is credited for booming oil and gas production in the United States, but environmental activist have blamed it for water pollution. Non-conventional deposits could be two to six times bigger than current proven oil reserves, the statement added. “Oil reserves from conventional deposits are being exhausted and in the last few years there’s been low incorporation of oil and gas,” Lloreda said. “It’s a scenario that does not just threaten Colombia’s energy self-sufficiency but which could worsen the macroeconomic problem.” Duque’s government is trying to pass a controversial tax reform that aims to raise 14 trillion pesos ($4.4 billion) to finance social programs. Problems with development of non-conventional reserves in the United States, Canada, Argentina and the United Kingdom have not been proven sufficient to prohibit use of the technology, the statement added. Colombian state oil company Ecopetrol has already requested an environmental license to launch a pilot plan to explore for crude using fracking. The area the company wants to explore could have 2 billion to 7 billion barrels of oil, triple the current proven reserves of 1.78 billion barrels, Ecopetrol has said. The country produced an average of 854,121 barrels per day of crude in 2017.

2018-11-07,"(Adds comments from CEO) SAO PAULO, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Biosev, the Brazilian sugar and ethanol unit controlled by commodities trader Louis Dreyfus, is open to market opportunities including the potential sale of additional mills, Chief Executive Officer Juan José Blanchard said on Wednesday. The company sold a mill in September and hired financial advisers to evaluate additional asset sales, as it seeks to reduce a large debt. “We are working carefully, evaluating the potential of each asset. It does not mean that our objective is simply to sell plants,” Blanchard, who became CEO in July, replacing Rui Chammas, told Reuters. “Of course, as part of this careful evaluation, we are open to market opportunities, strategic partnerships or sale of one or another asset,” he said in an interview following the release of quarterly results. Biosev posted a net loss of 155.6 million reais ($41.53 million) in the quarter ended in September, compared to a profit of 32.8 million reais a year earlier. Louis Dreyfus injected $1 billion in the unit earlier this year to improve its capital structure. Biosev also renegotiated most of its 6 billion reais in debt, gaining more time to start repayments now scheduled to 2021. Despite poor results recently for the unit, Blanchard sees an improving market outlook for both sugar and ethanol, which he said have the potential to boost the company’s cash generation. “In the global sugar market, there is an expectation for a new cycle of supply deficits in the next two years,” he said, adding that a fall in production in other regions should increase the value of Brazilian sugar production. Blanchard also said a new federal program to boost biofuels, called RenovaBio, should increase demand for cane-based ethanol in Brazil from 2020. $1 = 3.7322 reais

2018-11-07,"(Corrects paragraph 3 to remove reference to Devon Energy because the company does not have operations in Colorado) By Liz Hampton Nov 7 (Reuters) - Colorado voters on Tuesday rejected a measure calling for greater distances between oil and gas drilling and public spaces, a move opponents said would have sharply limited new wells in the fifth-largest oil producing state in the nation. The measure was defeated in an election that saw oil companies pour millions of dollars into efforts to combat the proposal. Shares of producers active in the state, including Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Noble Energy Inc rose on Wednesday, retracing some of their double-digit percentage declines since the initiative went on the state’s ballot. Known as Proposition 112, the measure would have mandated at least 2,500 feet (762 m) of separation between new drilling activities and occupied or vulnerable areas. It garnered 43 percent of votes with 91 percent of precincts reporting, according to data from the Colorado Secretary of State’s office. Passage required a majority of votes. Shares of Anadarko in early Wednesday trading rose 6 percent to $58.08, Devon gained 2 percent to $33.58 and Noble Energy climbed 3 percent to $27.853. Opponents said the measure would have cost Colorado’s economy between $169 billion and $217 billion over 12 years, and would have cut state and local tax revenues by $7 billion to $9 billion. Oil production in the state was up 26 percent year-over-year to 477,000 barrels per day, according to the latest U.S. government figures. “This measure was an extreme proposal that would have had devastating impacts across the state on jobs, education and numerous other programs,” said Chip Rimer, a senior vice president at Noble and chairman of the Colorado Oil & Gas Association. Municipal officials, including Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, urged voters to reject the measure, warning that it would hurt jobs and reduce tax revenues for schools, roads and public safety. The rejection was another setback for environmentalists who in 2016 failed to get a similar initiative placed on the ballot. Colorado Rising, an anti-fracking group that helped get the measure on the ballot, was vastly outspent but campaigned door-to-door and used phone and text messages to sway voters. “The outcome does not change the fact fracking operations are dangerous and should not be happening so close to Colorado homes, schools and drinking water,” said Colorado Rising’s Russell Mendell. “We will not stop until our Colorado neighborhoods are safe from this dangerous industrial activity.” Ahead of Tuesday’s vote, energy executives warned passage ultimately could lead them to reduce drilling in the state, although several said they expected no immediate impact.

2018-11-07,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped on Wednesday, continuing a recent slide after surging U.S. crude output hit another record and domestic inventories rose more than expected.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said domestic crude inventories rose 5.8 million barrels in the latest week, more than double analysts’ expectations. Crude output hit 11.6 million bpd, a weekly record, though weekly figures can be volatile. Most recent monthly data for August showed overall production at more than 11.3 million bpd. U.S. crude futures CLc1 fell 54 cents to settle at $61.67 a barrel, nearly 20 percent below a peak close of $76.41 a barrel in early October.     “The market has yet to prove that it can hold onto a rally, so the short-term mood is still very negative,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Brent crude LCOc1, the global benchmark, settled down 6 cents to $72.07 a barrel, bouncing off its post-EIA session low on support from earlier reports that Russia and Saudi Arabia are discussing whether to cut crude output next year.  While Iranian oil exports are expected to fall after U.S. sanctions took effect on Monday, reports from OPEC and other forecasters have indicated the global oil market could have a surplus in 2019 as demand slows. Also, the United States granted waivers on Iranian sanctions to eight countries who import that country’s crude. “The market is now going to look to OPEC and non-OPEC producers to rein in production as the U.S. has granted eight countries waivers from sanction, which in essence adds to supply,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. Russia and Saudi Arabia, top producers in an OPEC-led alliance, started bilateral talks on a return to production cuts next year, Russia’s TASS news agency reported, citing an unnamed source. In June, the producer group decided to relax output curbs in place since 2017, after pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump.  Analysts said those countries may be more willing to cut output now that the U.S. midterm elections are over. Trump, whose Republican party was fighting to retain control of congress, had complained of higher gasoline prices. “OPEC was feeling the Trump pressure but producers took action with the thinking that they just needed to get past the U.S. election,” said Joe McMonigle, analyst at Hedgeye in Washington, in a note Wednesday. “We expect to start hearing public comments from OPEC ministers this weekend” about pulling back on production.

2018-11-07,"(Reuters) - Voters in Colorado, Arizona and Washington states rejected ballot initiatives that sought to curb fossil fuels use by restricting drilling, putting a fee on carbon emissions and mandating wider use of renewable energy. The results were a setback for green activists, but a win for the energy industry and the Trump administration, which has sought to unfetter oil, gas, and coal production by rolling back environmental protections. The outcomes showed “voters reject policies that would make energy more expensive,” said Thomas J. Pyle, president of free market advocacy group American Energy Alliance.      While polls had indicated rising concerns among Americans over carbon emissions and water quality, the measures on the ballot in the three states to rein in fossil fuels industries were soundly rejected on U.S. Election Day on Tuesday.     In Colorado, an initiative to limit new drilling near populated or vulnerable areas, which would have heavily curtailed the industry, received 43 percent of the vote, less than the majority required to pass.  The Washington state measure, meanwhile, which would have imposed the nation’s first fee on carbon emissions - mostly at the expense of the state’s oil refiners - garnered only 44 percent of the vote. Groups defending the oil industry spent a combined $66 million to defeat the Colorado and Washington measures, with much of the contributions coming from large energy companies - including BP Plc and Marathon Oil Corp unit Andeavor.  Environmental groups blamed the defeat of the Washington state carbon fee on the hefty spending by opponents. “Big oil spent unprecedented amounts of money to tell big lies,” Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters, said at an event on Wednesday to discuss the election. Washington state’s measure was supported by millions of dollars in contributions from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and an alliance of other billionaires and environmental groups. Ted Halstead, head of the Climate Leadership Council, an industry-backed group proposing a nationwide carbon tax, said the defeat of the Washington state carbon fee “highlights the need for a popular and politically viable approach to carbon pricing at the federal level.” A tax or fee is intended to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In Arizona, voters defeated a proposal backed by billionaire activist Thomas Steyer that would have required electricity providers to use renewable energy for half of their needs by 2030, up from the current 15 percent. The measure was opposed by Arizona Public Service Co [AZD.UL], the state’s largest utility, which argued it would be forced to shut coal and nuclear plants, and pass along those costs to customers. A similar measure backed by Steyer in Nevada passed. On Wednesday Steyer said the failure in Arizona was due to the way the measure was described on the ballot, implying the change could drive up costs for consumers and which had been written by the state’s Republican attorney general. “What we saw in terms of the ballot initiatives is that Americans in purple states support clean energy overwhelmingly as long as you are allowed to talk honestly about it,” Steyer said, referring to states where the Democratic and Republican parties have similar levels of support.   Shares in oil producers operating in Colorado rallied on Wednesday after the state’s proposed drilling restrictions failed. Anadarko Petroleum Corp gained 6 percent and Noble Energy Inc jumped 5 percent.  “We think the wide margin of victory matters and that it will serve as a deterrent to those who might otherwise decide to fund another round of opposition to the industry in the next election cycle,” Capital One Advisors wrote in a Wednesday note about the Colorado measure. Colorado’s proposal would have required new oil wells to be at least 2,500 feet (762 m), five times the current minimum separation, from occupied or sensitive areas, effectively placing much of the state off-limits to new drilling.  “We are going to keep fighting,” Russell Mendell, of anti-fracking group Colorado Rising, which backed the measure, said on Wednesday. But opponents, including Colorado municipal officials, warned that the measure would have cost the state’s economy billions of dollars, and would have reduced funding for roads, schools and public safety.

U.S. oil prices slipped after U.S. crude output hit another record high. While gridlock could hamper President Donald Trump’s political and economic agenda, few analysts expect a reversal of tax cuts and financial deregulation measures that have already been enacted. That view helped all three Wall Street equity indices rally, with traders piling into technology and healthcare stocks. “I think it is more just relief that the election has come and gone, no surprises, no tail-risk outcome occurred. Gridlock is fine, let’s get on with things and worry about the fundamental issues like earnings, the (Federal Reserve),” said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston. Still, a split Congress could hamper Trump’s push for a further round of tax cuts and deregulation, measures that have supercharged the U.S. economy, stock markets and the dollar. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 423.38 points, or 1.65 percent, to 26,058.39, the S&P 500 gained 43.11 points, or 1.56 percent, to 2,798.56 and the Nasdaq Composite added 152.67 points, or 2.07 percent, to 7,528.63. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.06 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.43 percent. The U.S. Federal Reserve starts its two-day monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, and it is expected to keep interest rates unchanged. A rate hike in December is largely priced in. “The policy path implied by this outcome shifts the narrative away from rising rates at least temporarily,” Morgan Stanley’s Michael Zezas wrote in a client note. That view pushed the dollar lower against a basket of currencies. The dollar index fell 0.31 percent, with the euro up 0.24 percent to $1.1453. U.S. Treasury yields fell, but cut their decline after a record high amount of 30-year government bonds was met with weak demand. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 3/32 in price to yield 3.2022 percent, from 3.215 percent late on Tuesday. Attention will now focus on Trump’s hard line on trade tariffs, which he can impose without congressional approval. That keeps alive worries about a trade war between China and the United States. Chinese shares closed 0.7 percent lower, while Hong Kong stocks ended up 0.1 percent. Emerging market stocks lost 0.01 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.51 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.28 percent. The dollar’s weakness lifted other currencies. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.04 percent versus the greenback at 113.40 per dollar, while sterling was last at $1.3138, up 0.31 percent on the day. The Mexican peso rose overnight as the U.S. election results showed a Democratic majority in the House, but later fell as traders cashed in following four sessions of gains. The Mexican peso lost 0.84 percent versus the U.S. dollar, recently trading at 19.89. U.S. oil prices continued a recent slide after domestic inventories rose more than expected, adding to over-supply concerns as U.S. crude output hit another record high.

2018-11-07,"(Adds company comment on pipelines) Nov 7 (Reuters) - U.S. liquefied natural gas company Tellurian Inc said on Wednesday it expects to start construction on its Driftwood LNG export terminal in Louisiana in the first half of 2019 and begin operations in 2023. Chief Executive Meg Gentle said in the company’s third-quarter earnings that Tellurian will announce partners in the $27.5 billion project by the end of 2018. Driftwood is one of dozens LNG export projects under development in the United States seeking customers so they can start construction and enter service over the next decade to meet growing global demand for the fuel. U.S. LNG exports have almost quadrupled from 183.9 billion cubic feet (bcf) of natural gas in 2016 to 706.4 bcf in 2017, worth about $3.3 billion, and are on track to top 1,000 bcf in 2018, making the country one of the world’s biggest exporters of the super-cooled form of natural gas. One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. Including plants under construction, U.S. LNG export capacity is expected to jump from 3.8 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) now to 5.2 bcfd by the end of the year, 8.9 bcfd by the end of 2019 and 10.3 bcfd by the end of 2020. Tellurian said about 35 customers were interested in partnering with and buying gas from the project. Unlike most other proposed U.S. LNG export projects that will liquefy gas for a fee, Tellurian is offering customers the opportunity to meet their gas needs by investing in a full range of services from production to pipelines and liquefaction. In addition to the LNG terminal, Tellurian is also developing pipelines to transport gas from shale formations in Texas and Louisiana to LNG terminals and other Gulf Coast customers. The company has proposed to put two of those lines into service in 2022 - Permian Global Access and Haynesville Global Access. Tellurian’s partners include Total SA, General Electric Co and Bechtel, which has a $15.2 billion contract to build the liquefaction facility at the center of the project. Pipelines, reserves and other costs make up the rest of the $27.5 billion price tag of the project. Driftwood will have capacity to produce 27.6 million tonnes per year of LNG or about 4 bcfd of gas.

2018-11-07,"(Adds statement from NV Energy) By Trevor Hunnicutt Nov 7 (Reuters) - Nevada voters have blocked efforts supported by casino magnate Sheldon Adelson to open up the state’s electricity market, delivering welcome news to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. The two billionaires’ interests clashed in the Silver State desert over the cost and control of power for uses ranging from the Las Vegas Strip’s neon lights to equipment in the state’s precious metal mines. A state constitutional amendment supported by Republican donor Adelson, chairman of Las Vegas Sands Corp, would have forced legislators to break up control over much of Nevada’s electricity that is effectively held by Berkshire Hathaway unit, NV Energy. It would have allowed customers to choose their own power provider by 2023. Nevadans defeated the measure by 2-to-1 in Tuesday’s election, according to the latest vote count. Known as Question 3, the measure became one of the more costly during an election season that wound up with Democrats wresting control of the U.S. House of Representatives from Republicans. (reut.rs/2Dt0meR) Dueling Nevada interests poured at least $96 million into the electricity battle, according to filings with the state government. The “no” campaign outspent the Sands-backed campaign by nearly 2-to-1. In a statement, the communications director of the Coalition to Defeat Question 3, Tracy Skenandore, said the measure was risky and costly. Sands declined to comment. A NV Energy spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that, “we take the responsibility of serving Nevada’s electric needs personally and we remain focused on providing customers with reliable electric service and delivering on our promise to double renewable energy by 2023 while keeping rates low.” Proponents of the measure had argued that having a choice on a power utility could lower costs. Hotel-casinos like Sands’ Venetian, whose lights glitter in Las Vegas, are major power customers in the state. Caesars Entertainment Corp, Wynn Resorts Ltd and MGM Resorts International earlier opted to pay tens of millions in exit fees to drop their power provider. “We are disappointed with the results of this election and will continue this fight until Nevadans have the right to choose affordable, clean energy,” Dave Chase, campaign manager for Yes on 3, said in a statement. The Nevada measure placed new pressure on an industry shaken up by the growth of alternative energy sources, some of which have made it easier for consumers to generate their own electricity. Buffett, a supporter of liberal causes who backed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016, has built an empire in the energy industry through acquisitions, many directed by Greg Abel, now considered a potential successor to Buffett as Berkshire’s chief executive. Since Berkshire acquired it in 2013, NV Energy has made investments in solar power, in addition to coal and natural gas sources. It reached an agreement in 2016 with Elon Musk’s SolarCity Corp that allowed thousands of Nevada rooftop solar customers to take advantage of richer subsidies than under new rate guidelines that NV Energy had supported. NV Energy’s pretax earnings in the most recent quarter declined 23 percent from a year earlier due to lower margins and increased operating costs.

2018-11-07,"(Repeats to more subscrbers, no changes to headline or text) By Rod Nickel WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Two Canadian-based crude producers are looking to double down on their oil sands investments, betting that new pipelines and cutting-edge technology can improve profitability and reduce environmental damage. The moves by Imperial Oil Ltd and Teck Resources Ltd run counter to an exodus of foreign companies from the oil sands last year. Calgary-based Imperial, majority owned by Exxon Mobil Corp , said late on Tuesday it would build its C$2.6-billion Aspen project. Construction starts before year-end, with first oil expected in 2022. Teck has not yet made a final investment decision on its C$20.6-billion Frontier project, which is undergoing regulatory hearings. Both are advancing as pipeline congestion resulted in record discounts on Canadian oil last month. Imperial and Teck bet it will abate in the next few years. Enbridge Inc is expanding its Line 3 pipeline to handle more Canadian crude, and producers hope the Ottawa-owned Trans Mountain and TransCanada Corp Keystone XL pipeline expansions go forward despite opposition. A stream of foreign companies such as ConocoPhillips divested oil sand assets last year. Steep price discounts prompted Canadian Natural Resources and several others to announce up to 98,400 barrels per day (bpd) in total production cuts last week. But Imperial said Aspen will use solvents and steam to unlock 75,000 bpd, applying new technology to reduce emissions and water use while making extraction more economical. “We try not to get too excited when times are good and try not to get too depressed when times are bad,” Chief Executive Officer Rich Kruger said at Imperial’s investor day in Toronto on Wednesday. “When’s the best time to build things? When no one else is building, because you get the highest quality trades and contractors.” Both projects face doubts that they will pay off. “The challenge with both is oil sands projects are typified by high up-front capital,” said IHS Markit vice-president Kevin Birn. “And you have to wait years before you generate any revenue.” Teck began regulatory hearings in September for Frontier, an open-pit mine that would produce 170,000 bpd in its first phase, starting in 2026. The company said on Monday Frontier would be economical at a range of oil prices and rank among the lowest-emitting oil sands operations due to new technology. “While we know that use of alternative energy will increase, we also know that oil will remain an important part of the world energy mix,” Teck spokesman Chris Stannell said. “The long-term outlook for the global oil market is favourable for a project such as Frontier.” Unlike proposed pipelines, Aspen and Frontier have the support of aboriginal peoples living nearby. Mikisew Cree First Nation conditionally supports Frontier and hopes to buy a stake, said Melody Lepine, the band’s director. That support should reassure shareholders, Lepine said. “Teck and Imperial can go back to their investors and say, ‘look we have these agreements with indigenous communities.’” Mikisew and another band invested last year in a Suncor Energy storage facility. Some Teck investors remain skeptical that the coal miner should be in the oil business, said Clarksons analyst Jeremy Sussman. Teck owns part of a Suncor oil sands mine. “Do you double down? Do you divest? It’s an open question,” he said. The odds appear longer for Teck’s higher-cost Frontier to succeed than Imperial’s Aspen, said Manash Goswami, senior vice-president at First Asset ETFs, which owns Imperial shares. The Teck Frontier project “doesn’t make any sense,” Goswami maintained. “It’s hard to see, unless oil prices go materially higher, another mining project getting sanctioned.” But a one-time industry opponent now sees a future for crude. Chief Allan Adam of Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation recently backed Frontier. He reasoned that oil is not going away and he can better protect community interests from the inside. “If people are saying the oil sands are going to die off, I imagine they’re going to park their vehicles and start walking. I don’t think that’s going to happen anytime soon.” $1 = 1.3057 Canadian dollars

2018-11-07,"(Adds details into probes into Zinke) WASHINGTON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday praised Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who has come under scrutiny for his use of a security detail, chartered flights and a real estate deal, but seemed to leave open the possibility of replacing him. “We’re looking at that, and I do want to study whatever is being said. I think he’s doing an excellent job, but we will take a look at that in a very strong - and we’ll probably have an idea about that in about a week,” Trump told reporters. Last month the Interior Department’s acting inspector general referred a probe into Zinke’s conduct to the U.S. Department of Justice, increasing the chances of a criminal investigation. The investigation is expected to involve a Montana real estate deal involving a foundation set up by Zinke and a development group backed by David Lesar, the chairman of oil service company Halliburton Co. A Lesar spokeswoman has said that his personal investment had nothing to do with Halliburton and that the company was confident it would not influence the Interior Department. The inspector general’s office at Interior has also probed Zinke over several ethics allegations. The department’s watchdog agency said last month that Zinke’s sending of a security detail to Turkey and Greece to protect him and his wife cost taxpayers over $25,000. Zinke has said he did not ask the security detail to travel with him. Probes into Zinke’s behavior follow ethics investigations into several Trump administration officials, including Scott Pruitt, who stepped down as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency in July, and Tom Price, who resigned as Health and Human Services secretary in September 2017.

2018-11-07,"JOHANNESBURG, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Billions of dollars in fines owed by South African companies MTN and Standard Bank to Nigerian regulators could increase the risk to South Africa’s financial system, the central bank said on Wednesday. The Nigerian central bank in August accused telecoms firm MTN and its lender Stanbic, a Standard Bank subsidiary, of illegally sending $8.1 billion abroad. The Nigerian government has also demanded $2 billion in related taxes from MTN. The South African mobile operator makes about a third of its annual core profit in the West African country. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) said in its semi-annual review of financial stability that the repatriation claim and the $2 billion underpayment in tax amounted to approximately 100 percent of MTN’s market capitalisation. “Any potential impact on the South African financial system arising from this event will depend on the eventual resolution of the matters raised and MTN Group’s ability to continue meeting its debt obligations,” the bank said. “A potential worst-case scenario would be for the MTN Group to disinvest from Nigeria,” the central bank added. In October a Nigerian judge set a hearing for the dispute for Dec. 4. Some analysts have cited the concentrated foreign currency funding risk posed by MTN and a clutch of other Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed firms as a threat to the currency and the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves. The central bank said that if there were a spillover from the market turmoil linked to external debt and the foreign currency funding crunch that hit Turkey and Argentina earlier this year, South Africa could suffer sharp capital outflows and exchange rate depreciation. The rand is already down around 15 percent against the dollar this year, while portfolio flows slumped dramatically in the first half as a local recession exacerbated the global flight from emerging markets.

The fund is forbidden by parliament from investing in firms that produce nuclear weapons or landmines, or are involved in the production of tobacco, among other criteria. Carbon emissions became a criteria for exclusion from the fund in 2016 and last year the Council on Ethics, the fund’s ethics watchdog, recommended “a small handful” of firms be excluded for producing too much greenhouse gas emissions in either the oil, cement and steel sectors. Since then recommendations have been under review by the board of the central bank, which oversees the fund, but a decision has been delayed several times. On Wednesday, the board said it had discussed the recommendations from the ethics watchdog at a meeting on Oct. 24. “The Board did not decide on any exclusions of individual companies at this meeting,” Governor Oeystein Olsen and Deputy Governor Egil Matsen said in a letter to the finance ministry dated and published Wednesday. Among the reasons it cited was that more work was needed to assess the ground for exclusion. “Compared with other criteria in the (ethics) guidelines, the climate criterion does not provide a very precise definition of what conduct should constitute grounds for a decision to exclude,” said the letter. “Norges Bank would ask the Ministry of Finance to help clarify whether the primary basis for assessment against the climate criterion is intended to be companies’ emissions.” Matsen told Reuters in June that the main difficulty in discussions had been to define and limit this new type of criteria based on the companies’ conduct or behaviour, rather than their products.

The Democrats looked headed to gain more than 30 seats in the House of Representatives, well beyond the 23 they needed to claim their first majority in eight years.

While polls have indicated rising concerns among Americans over carbon emissions and water quality, initiatives to rein in oil-and-gas activities were soundly rejected in several states on U.S. Election Day on Tuesday. The results showed “voters reject policies that would make energy more expensive and less reliable to them, their families, and the larger economy,” said Thomas J. Pyle, president of free market advocacy group American Energy Alliance. In Colorado, an initiative to limit new drilling near populated or vulnerable areas received 43 percent of the vote, less than the majority required to pass. The Washington state measure, which garnered 44 percent of the vote, would have imposed a fee on carbon emissions, mostly at the expense of the state’s oil refiners. Groups defending the oil industry spent a combined $66 million to defeat the two measures, with much of the contributions coming from large energy companies. Washington state’s measure was supported by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and an alliance of environmental groups. In Arizona, voters defeated a proposal backed by billionaire activist Thomas Steyer that would have required electricity providers to use renewable energy for half of their needs by 2030, up from the current 15 percent. The measure was opposed by Arizona Public Service Co , the state’s largest utility, which argued it would be forced to shut coal and nuclear plants, and pass along those costs to customers. Shares in oil producers operating in Colorado rallied on Wednesday, with Anadarko Petroleum Corp gaining 6.6 percent and Noble Energy Inc up 5.7 percent. “We think the wide margin of victory matters and that it will serve as a deterrent to those who might otherwise decide to fund another round of opposition to the industry in the next election cycle,” Capital One Advisors wrote in a Wednesday note. Colorado’s proposal would have required new oil wells to be at least 2,500 feet (762 m), five times the current minimum separation, from occupied or sensitive areas, effectively placing much of the state off-limits to new drilling. “We are proud of our thousands of volunteers who fought ‘til the very end to protect their communities,” said Russell Mendell, of anti-fracking group Colorado Rising, which backed the measure. “We will not stop until our Colorado neighborhoods are safe from this dangerous industrial activity.” But opponents, including Colorado municipal officials, warned that the measure would have cost the state’s economy billions of dollars, and would have reduced funding for roads, schools and public safety. “The oil and natural gas industry and its employees look forward to discussing concerns with reasonable people looking for reasonable solutions,” said Karen Crummy, communications director for Protect Colorado, a group backed by oil companies that opposed the measure.

2018-11-07,"* Miner aims to raise output to 130 million tonnes by 2022 * Plans $3 billion of investment in next 4-5 years * Interested in IPO when the time is right By Polina  Ivanova MOSCOW, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Russia’s largest coal producer SUEK plans to ramp up output by 20 million tonnes, or 18 percent, over the next four years and is gearing up for an initial public offering (IPO) when the time is right, Chairman Alexander Landia said. SUEK is already the world’s third largest coal exporter after Glencore and BHP Billiton. Its plans to boost coal production will please the Kremlin, which has called for Russia to grab a larger share of the global market. SUEK, controlled by businessman Andrey Melnichenko, plans to bump up output from 110 million to 130 million tonnes by 2022, Landia said. “In the coming four to five years, we are going to invest something like $3 billion in further developing infrastructure,” he told Reuters in an interview. SUEK, whose full name is the Siberian Coal Energy Company, was ranked the world’s sixth largest coal producer in 2017 with output of 107.8 million tonnes, of which 56.4 million tonnes were sold on international markets. SUEK plans to increase the share of its coal it is able to wash - a process that removes impurities - from 40 percent to around 60 percent, Landia added. The company, which already sells 30 percent of its product to the Asia-Pacific market, sees Asia as the prime market for its exports. Russia has been seeking to double its coal exports to Asia by 2025 with China seen as particularly important. As well as being a natural commodities trading partner for fast-growing China, Moscow has been seeking closer ties with Beijing since the West imposed sanctions on Russia in 2014. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in August that Russia plans to produce around 420 million tonnes of coal this year, surpassing a Soviet record. By 2030, output could reach 590 million tonnes. Exports, currently at over 200 million tonnes, are also expected to grow, Novak said. SUEK was ready to float its shares before it put its plans on hold due to market conditions in 2011. Since then, the stream of international Russian IPOs has largely dried up due to Western sanctions, but SUEK is still keen to become a listed company. “Both public debt and public equity markets would be interesting for us,” Landia said. There is no specific plan in place, Landia said, except to be prepared to make such a move when the time is right. Media reports in 2011 said the company planned to list its shares in London and that a flotation at that time could have valued the company at close to $5 billion. In August, SUEK merged with Melnichenko’s power-generating firm SGK to increase operational and financial effectiveness. “That’s our plan, be prepared. Because the market is quite volatile... If there will be an attractive opportunity, we will be seriously looking at that,” Landia said.

2018-11-07,"(Updates to add quotes, context) By Pratima Desai and Polina  Ivanova LONDON/MOSCOW, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Russian steelmaker Severstal will ramp up investments by 75 percent next year, a decision which may require borrowing, its chief financial officer told Reuters on Wednesday. The company announced a string of projects that will see capital expenditure rise to around $1.4 billion next year and in 2020, from an average of $800 million in the previous 7 years. “A significant proportion of the investment is related to cost savings...including putting conveyor belts in our iron ore mines and saving on transport costs. A few others are related to quality and product mix,” Severstal’s CFO Alexey Kulichenko said. After peaking over the next two years, capital expenditure will return to $750 million by 2023. “Each of the projects we are going to invest in has a strong rationale in terms of high internal rate of return and significant (core earnings) contribution,” Kulichenko said. According to its new strategy presentation, the company is aiming for 10 to 15 percent annual growth in its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) between 2019 and 2023. Investment will mostly be funded by the company’s cash flow. But some additional borrowing may be required. “We may borrow from the banks, we may issue debt... it will be moderate, maybe $200 million to $400 million. Whether we borrow or issue debt depends on how the market situation develops,” Kulichenko said. Although next year’s dividend will not reflect the higher capital expenditure, the company said it expects payouts to reduce as the market weakens in future. “We will not use this temporary increase in capital expenditure to reduce dividend flow. For 2019 we will pay dividends as if our capital expenditure was a normal $800 million,” Kulichenko said. “Where dividends are this year is unlikely to be repeated because the market situation - definitely we do not expect (it) to stay like that,” he added. The company previously forecast steel demand growth in its home Russian market of 3 to 4 percent in 2018, but now expects 1 percent growth this year and next. Global steel prices also paint a precarious picture, analysts at BCS Global Markets said. “Investments in the steel sector (excluding maintenance and required repairs) look risky to us, given that steel prices are already falling and should decline further due to oversupply in the industry,” BCS analyst Oleg Petropavlovsky said. Severstal said it expects steel sales in the fourth quarter to decline, though this will be offset by a strong performance by the mining division. The company is also a producer of iron ore and coking coal. “The situation in the market is quite challenging and prices are softening...but all-in-all we expect comparable quarters, maybe even slightly stronger because of mining performance”, Kulichenko said.

2018-11-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - A return to oil production cuts by OPEC and its allies next year cannot be ruled out, two OPEC sources said on Wednesday, to avert a possible supply glut that could weigh on prices. The sources were responding to a report by Russia’s TASS news agency that Russia and Saudi Arabia had started bilateral discussions over possible curbs to output in 2019. Saudi-led OPEC and its allies including Russia decided in June to relax output curbs in place since 2017, after pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to reduce oil prices and make up for supply losses from Iran. Asked whether discussions pointed to a return to supply cuts in 2019, one of the two sources, who are delegates from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, said: “Certainly not the other way around.” Oil prices have come under downward pressure from rising supplies, even though Iranian exports are expected to fall because of new U.S. sanctions. Forecasts of a 2019 supply surplus and slowing demand have also dented the market. Brent crude LCOc1 had dropped from a four-year high in October above $86 a barrel to $71 on Tuesday. Prices rallied back above $73 on Wednesday, supported by the TASS report. Separately, a top OPEC official from Iran, which has been angered by higher production in Saudi Arabia and Russia in response to Trump’s calls, said Riyadh and Moscow needed to cut output by 1 million barrels per day. “There is no other way for Saudi Arabia and Russia,” Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, who represents Iran on OPEC’s board of governors, told Reuters when asked whether producers needed to trim output in 2019.  The extra supply has caused a drop in crude prices, hurting income for other oil producers while helping Iran’s foe Trump  in the U.S. midterm elections, Kazempour said.    “They pushed the prices $15 a barrel lower in one month and only made U.S. gasoline cheaper for Trump. They lost billions on revenue and caused losses to poor producers in Africa and South America,” he said. A ministerial committee of some OPEC members and allies meets on Sunday in Abu Dhabi to discuss the market and outlook for 2019. Iran is not a member of this committee, which it wants scrapped. This group, called the JMMC, could make a recommendation on 2019 output policy to the next decision-making meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC oil ministers, a third OPEC source said. That meeting takes place on Dec. 6-7 in Vienna.  “Any serious discussion will be towards the December meeting,” this source said.

2018-11-07,"LISBON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Portuguese wind energy group EDP Renovaveis said on Wednesday it expected to exceed its 2020 goal for increasing capacity by more than 10 percent. EDPR, a subsidiary of EDP Energias de Portugal, also said in a presentation it had secured projects to add capacity of more than 1 gigawatt after 2020, adding that its growth strategy was not affected by adverse cyclical factors that have weighed on its earnings this year. EDP and EDPR are both targets of a takeover offer by China Three Gorges, which is still subject to regulatory approvals in various countries. Shares in EDPR, which earlier posted a 30 percent drop in nine-month profit due to weak wind conditions and foreign exchange impacts, were 0.3 percent higher at 1500 GMT. EDPR said the additional capacity target, which had been set at 3.5 GW under its 2016-2020 business plan, is now projected to reach 3.9 GW, with 1.2 GW already added in 2016-17 and North America leading the main growth. After 2020, EDPR expects to add solar power capacity in the United States and Brazil, and more onshore wind energy production in Brazil, with the total reaching 1 GW. EDPR, which manages operating assets of 11.2 GW in 11 countries, also expects to bring two large European offshore wind projects, in which it owns stakes of between 43 and 57 percent and which have a total capacity of almost 2 GW, online. The Portuguese company said regulatory implications of the China Three Gorges takeover were “not clear and may impact EDPR strategy and growth prospects”, particularly the U.S. business. China Three Gorges has held talks with European utilities to gauge their interest in buying  EDP’s and EDPR’s U.S. renewables business as it looks to smooth the path for its planned takeover, sources said.

The Democrats looked headed for a gain of more than 30 seats in the House of Representatives, well beyond the 23 they needed to claim their first majority in eight years. With President Donald Trump’s Republican party holding on to its Senate majority, the results from Tuesday’s election were in line with expectations. While gridlock in Washington could hamper Trump’s political and economic agenda, few expect a reversal of tax cuts and financial deregulation measures that have already been enacted. That view helped all three Wall Street equity indices open stronger. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 213.04 points, or 0.83 percent, to 25,848.05, the S&P 500 gained 27.55 points, or 1.00 percent, to 2,783 and the Nasdaq Composite added 84.49 points, or 1.15 percent, to 7,460.45. “The good news in a way for markets is that there was an uncertainty that’s now been removed. We know where we stand for the next two years, and investors will focus back on the fundamentals, which are (company) earnings growth and the economy,” said Guy Miller, chief market strategist at Zurich Insurance Group. Interactive chart on U.S. midterms tmsnrt.rs/2D6XH9t Still, a split Congress could hamper Trump’s push for a further round of tax cuts and deregulation, measures that have turbocharged the U.S. economy, stock markets and the dollar. After volatile Asian trade, where stocks and the dollar swung on the Republicans’ fluctuating prospects, the pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.02 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.90 percent. It was the seventh straight day of gains in global shares. Riskier European bonds such as those from Italy also were in demand, with yields falling 6-9 basis points. The Fed is expected to signal this week that an interest rate rise remains on the agenda for December. “Certainly it is now unlikely we will see additional fiscal stimulus in the near-term, that’s a profound change but there will be no repeal of what’s already in place,” Miller said. That view pushed the dollar lower against a basket of currencies. The dollar index fell 0.48 percent, with the euro up 0.32 percent to $1.1462. Ten-year U.S. Treasury bond yields at one point fell to a low of 3.176 percent as it became clear that more fiscal stimulus was unlikely. An initial knee-jerk rise to 3.25 percent came after early reports of a better-than-expected performance by the Republicans, but that move soon fizzled as results trickled in. “Democrats winning the House is likely to mean slightly less fiscal stimulus going forward. The bond market may take that well because the Federal Reserve will have less work to do,” said Richard Buxton, head of UK equities at Merian Global Investors. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 6/32 in price to yield 3.193 percent, from 3.215 percent late on Tuesday. Attention will focus on Trump’s hard line on trade tariffs, which he can impose without Congressional approval. That keeps alive worries about a trade war between China and the United States. Chinese shares closed 0.7 percent lower, while Hong Kong markets ended just above flat. The dollar’s weakness lifted other currencies. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.11 percent versus the greenback at 113.32 per dollar, while sterling was last at $1.314, up 0.33 percent on the day. Oil prices reversed their earlier decline after a report that Russia and Saudi Arabia were discussing output cuts in 2019 . U.S. crude rose 0.69 percent to $62.64 per barrel and Brent was last at $72.83, up 0.97 percent on the day. Additional reporting by Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo; Tomo Uetake

2018-11-07,"RIYADH, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s Bahri is targeting acquisitions in Asia and the Middle East as the exclusive oil shipper for state energy giant Saudi Aramco seeks to expand its reach, the chief executive said on Wednesday. Bahri is the world’s largest owner and operator of very large crude carriers (VLCCs). Saudi sovereign wealth fund the Public Investment Fund (PIF) owns 22 percent of the company and Aramco has a 20 percent stake. “We are looking at multiple acquisitions in the Middle East and Asia worth tens of millions of dollars,” Bahri CEO Abdullah Aldubaikhi told Reuters. “We want to tap into a new area related to the maritime sector by acquiring companies offering services that are not currently available within Bahri’s portfolio,” he said, without specifying what services would be added. The company aimed to buy a listed firm in Asia in a deal that would probably be completed in the third quarter of 2019, he said, without elaborating. Bahri transports Saudi Aramco’s VLCC cargoes on a cost, insurance and freight (CIF) basis, making it the world’s busiest oil shipper. It transports crude oil, chemicals and dry bulk. It also offers ship management services. In 2014 it merged with the former shipping arm of Aramco, Vela Marine International. Acquisitions in the pipeline will be financed from the company’s own funds and banking finance, Aldubaikhi said. The company, which has 45 VLCCs, plans to add 15 more to its fleet through a $1.5 billion investment fund it launched in 2017 with Arab Petroleum Investments Corp (APICORP). The APICORP Bahri Oil Shipping Fund (ABOSF) will raise $1.5 billion in three stages raising $500 million each time. APICORP will contribute 85 percent of the funds and Bahri the rest. The first $500 million phase would be raised in the first quarter of 2019 and the second tranche would probably be completed in the second quarter of 2020, Aldubaikhi said. Bahri reported a 34.4 percent increase in third quarter net profit to 81.3 million riyals ($22.7 million) after zakat and tax, versus 60.5 million riyals a year earlier. “We are expanding and growing, and although the shipping industry is cyclical, I think it has bottomed out in 2018,” Aldubaikhi said. “The cycle of the shipping industry in 2019 will improve, and the years 2020 and 2021 will be the golden years for this industry.” $1 = 3.7509 riyals

2018-11-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - Russia and Saudi Arabia have started to discuss cutting production next year following steep falls in oil prices in the last month, according to a report by Russia’s TASS news agency. The report has not been confirmed but has arrested the rapid decline in prices, at least temporarily, and should not come as a surprise given the altered dynamics in the oil market. The oil market is best thought of as a complex adaptive system, characterised by long lags and positive feedback mechanisms, which exaggerate the impact of even small changes in production and consumption. OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, and its non-OPEC allies, led by Russia, have stated that their objective is to keep the market as close as possible to balance and minimise damaging price swings. But in the history of the oil market, production and consumption have rarely been balanced except accidentally and not usually for very long. The market’s natural state is one of imbalance, with deep and prolonged cycles in spot prices and inventories as it alternatives between periods of under- and over-supply. In this context, the best market management strategy for OPEC+ involves timely, frequent and small adjustments in production in response to changing estimates of production and consumption. Prompt action in response to incoming information about potential future market imbalances may be able to forestall the need for much larger adjustments later. Decision-making has been considerably simplified because Russia and Saudi Arabia are the only two members of OPEC+ that need to reach agreement (with United Arab Emirates and Kuwait playing a supporting role). Other members of OPEC+ have no spare production capacity and are not needed to show much production flexibility to keep the market close to balance. Russia and Saudi Arabia have already made several adjustments to their production plans this year in response to a changing production and consumption outlook. OPEC+ members started the year insisting they would not increase production because of a lingering overhang of stocks above the five-year average. By June, Russia and Saudi Arabia had begun raising output as rapid consumption growth and the loss of production from Venezuela drew down stocks faster than expected and pushed prices higher. In August and September, Russia and Saudi Arabia came under renewed pressure to raise output further as oil traders became concerned about the loss of exports from Iran due to U.S. sanctions and prices surged. Since then, signs of a renewed surge in U.S. shale production, concerns about consumption growth and sanctions waivers for Iran’s exports have sent prices sharply lower and prompted yet another rethink. The biggest sources of uncertainty for Russia and Saudi Arabia stem from (a) the state of the global economy and oil consumption, and (b) the output from U.S. shale fields. In recent weeks, economists and investors have become increasingly pessimistic about the outlook for global growth, and by extension oil consumption in 2019, resulting in sharp falls in equity and oil prices. While oil consumption threatens to disappoint on the downside, production from U.S. shale fields is surprising on the upside, reinforcing the market-management challenge for OPEC+. U.S. shale production has risen much faster this year than expected, with output in August up 2 million barrels per day (bpd) compared with the same month a year earlier. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2Qoswu5) The U.S. Energy Information Administration now expects crude and condensates production to average 10.90 million bpd in 2018, compared with a forecast of just 9.95 million barrels per day 12 months ago. The agency has raised its forecast for average crude and condensates production to 12.06 million bpd in 2019, up from 10.85 million bpd in January (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, Nov. 2018). These huge upward revisions in forecast U.S. shale production coupled with a downgraded global growth outlook have left OPEC+ members with little choice but to review their output plans. Brent’s six-month calendar spread has collapsed into contango as oil traders anticipate improved crude availability and a production surplus at the end of 2018 and into 2019. If Russia and Saudi Arabia want to avoid the market becoming oversupplied next year they will need to reduce their production early to prevent the accumulation of a larger imbalance.

The Democrats looked headed for a gain of more than 30 seats in the House of Representatives, well beyond the 23 they needed to claim their first majority in eight years.

That view put all three New York equity indices on track for a strong opening, with S&P500 and Nasdaq futures up 1 percent and 1.2 percent respectively  by 1230 GMT, while the Dow Jones was set to open up 0.7 percent. “The good news in a way for markets is that there was an uncertainty that’s now been removed.

Most analysts agree the newly empowered House Democrats will have the ability to investigate Trump’s tax returns, possible business conflicts of interest and allegations involving his 2016 campaign’s links to Russia. Moreover, a split Congress will be able to hamper Trump’s push for a further round of tax cuts and deregulation - measures that have turbo-charged the U.S. economy, stock markets and the dollar. The Fed is expected to signal this week that an interest rate rise remains on the agenda for December. “Certainly it is now unlikely we will see additional fiscal stimulus in the near-term, that’s a profound change but there will be no repeal of what’s already in place,” Miller said. That view pushed the dollar 0.5 percent lower against a basket of currencies though it clawed back some earlier losses. Ten-year U.S. Treasury bond yields fell to a low of 3.176 percent as it became clear that more fiscal stimulus was unlikely. An initial knee-jerk rise to 3.25 percent came after early reports of a better-than-expected performance by the Republicans, but that move soon fizzled as results trickled in. “Democrats winning the House is likely to mean slightly less fiscal stimulus going forward. The bond market may take that well because the Federal Reserve will have less work to do,” said Richard Buxton, head of UK equities at Merian Global Investors. Attention will also focus on Trump’s hard line on trade tariffs, which he can impose without Congressional approval. That keeps alive worries about a trade war between China and the United States. Chinese shares closed 0.7 percent lower, while Hong Kong markets ended just above flat.. “We would argue that if Trump can do less on the domestic front, he is more likely to focus on external matters such as trade, which will impact risk sentiment,” said Patrick O’Donnell, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management in London. The dollar’s weakness boosted other currencies. Against the yen, the greenback was 0.2 percent lower to 113.06, having reversed a move to one-month highs of 113.82 yen. The euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.1481, a two-week high, while the British pound gained 0.4 percent to $1.3168, rising for a third straight day after a BBC report that Britain was preparing for a Brexit deal by end-November. Oil prices reversed their earlier decline, meanwhile, with Brent futures jumping 1.4 percent to above $73 a barrel after a report that Russia and Saudi Arabia were discussing output cuts in 2019.

2018-11-07,"Nov 7 (Reuters) - The United States on Monday re-imposed sanctions against Iran’s oil exports to punish Tehran for its involvement in several Middle Eastern conflicts. Washington had been pushing governments to cut imports of Iranian oil to zero. but fearing a crude oil price spike, it granted Iran’s biggest buyers - China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey - sanctions waivers. That will allow the eight, which account for about 75 percent of all Iran’s oil exports, according to trade data, to import at least some oil for another 180 days. Washington and the recipients of the waivers have not disclosed how much oil they are allowed to import, or under what conditions deals can still be made. Analysts have estimated the overall volumes allowed under the waivers at between 700,000 and 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) compared with a peak of around 3 million bpd in Iranian crude and condensate exports in mid-2018. J.P. Morgan said “the lack or difficulty in acquiring shipping insurance will help in reducing exports quickly as they did during last international sanctions.” The U.S. bank also said “payments for the oil by the exempt countries must go into escrow accounts in their local currency” and that this “means the money won’t directly go to Iran and it can only be used to buy certain non-sanctioned goods from its crude export customers.” Once the waivers expire after 180 days, new waivers are expected to be issued, with a source in China saying his country would likely receive another six months of exemptions, though at a lower rate of around 220,000 bpd. See below further details that have begun to emerge. China, the world’s biggest importer of crude oil, is also the top buyer of Iranian oil, and its mostly state-owned refiners have lobbied hard for waivers. Several Chinese sources with knowledge of the matter said China would be allowed to buy 360,000 bpd of Iranian crude during the exemption period of 180 days. That would be about half the daily average China has been importing from Iran since January 2016, trade data showed. However, one source said the United States had attached strings to the waivers, including counterparty disclosures and laying open settlement methods, which were being evaluated before placing new orders with Iran. India has become the world’s third biggest oil importer, recently overtaking Japan. India is also Iran’s second biggest oil customer and will be one of the most exposed to a forced drop in supply because of its relative proximity to Iran. One Indian source close to the country’s refining sector said India would likely be allowed to import around 300,000 bpd of Iranian crude during the exemption period compared with normal volumes of around 450,000-550,000 bpd. South Korea is a large buyer of Iranian condensate, a super light form of crude oil used by its large petrochemical industry. A close U.S. ally, South Korea had stopped buying crude from Iran ahead of the sanctions while still lobbying for exemptions. This week, reports emerged that South Korea received a waiver allowing it to import around 4 million barrels a month (130,000 bpd) of Iranian crude and condensate. South Korea has averaged over 200,000 bpd of oil imports from Iran so far this year, down from around 350,000 bpd in 2017. Japan, another key Asian U.S. ally, also ceased Iranian oil imports prior to the sanctions, but has received a waiver to import an undisclosed amount of oil from Iran in the next 180 days. Japan’s trade minister, Hiroshige Seko, said on Tuesday that Japanese buyers were expected to resume imports from the Islamic Republic again soon. Refining sources in Japan, however, said they first needed to evaluated the conditions attached to the waivers, with no new orders likely before December. Taiwan is only an occasional importer of Iranian oil, and no details regarding its waivers have been disclosed. Italy and Turkey have been importing around 200,000 bpd of oil from Iran over the past two years, with Greece importing less than 100,000 bpd. Italy and Greece have completely suspended purchases in recent weeks. The waivers for those countries took the market by surprise and trading sources have said they are now evaluating prospects for resuming some imports. Turkey has said it is also evaluating possible imports after receiving a waiver, but President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday the country would not abide by the sanctions as they were aimed at “unbalancing the world”.

2018-11-07,"(Repeats item published earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: Imports of countries with waivers tmsnrt.rs/2RBDfS5 By Clyde Russell MELBOURNE, Nov 7 (Reuters) - In the end, President Donald Trump kicked the Iran crude oil sanctions can six months down the road, raising questions as to how the various players in the dispute will use the time. The U.S. government granted waivers to eight buyers of Iranian crude, exempting them from the sanctions that came into effect this week that are aimed at reducing exports from the Islamic Republic to zero. The waivers will allow the eight countries, which include top buyers China and India, to keep buying crude for another 180 days, a move aimed at reducing the shock of a sudden loss of all Iranian exports. There are a number of ways of looking at the U.S. decision to grant waivers to countries which together account for some 80 percent of Iran’s total oil exports. The first would be that Trump and his administration effectively blinked first in their dispute with Iran over its nuclear and missile programmes. It could also be argued that it was a rare example of ‘realpolitik’ from the Trump administration, with the tacit recognition that cutting Iran’s exports to zero in one fell swoop would boost crude prices, hurting not only U.S. consumers but also the rest of the world. Trump was keen to talk up his administration’s capability of completely isolating Iran. But perhaps with an eye on the mid-term U.S. elections on Tuesday, he made it clear that keeping crude prices low was also a priority. “I could get the Iran oil down to zero immediately but it would cause a shock to the market. I don’t want to lift oil prices,” Trump told reporters on Nov. 5 before flying to a campaign event. The decision to grant the waivers has already calmed oil markets, which hadn’t really anticipated Tehran’s exports dropping to zero but may have also been uncertain as to how much crude would actually be lost. Brent crude closed at $72.13 a barrel on Tuesday, down 1.4 percent from the close on Nov. 5., and down 15 percent from the four-year high of $84.79 reached on Oct. 3. Tanker-tracking and port data suggests that Iran has already suffered a fairly steep drop in exports prior to the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions. From some 2.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of exports in 2017, Iran’s exports dropped to around 2 million bpd in recent months, according to Refinitiv data. A further drop is on the cards for November, with the caveat that tracking Iran’s exports has become more difficult given that state-owned tankers are turning off their vessel-monitoring systems. With the granting of the waivers, it’s likely that Iran will be able to keep its exports at least around 1.1 million bpd, and possibly even as high as the 2 million bpd of recent months. For the Iranians, the 180-day waivers provides them with a financial lifeline and time to try and lobby support from other countries against Washington’s sanctions. For major buyers like China, which imported about 650,000 bpd of Iranian crude in the first 10 months of the year, the waivers allow it to maintain diversity of supply, as well as keeping prices lower. With Iranian barrels still in the market, the pressure on other major exporters like Saudi Arabia and Russia to ensure a well-supplied market - or risk Trump’s displeasure - is reduced. But they may not be happy if crude prices continue to weaken. The big question is how does the Trump administration use the six-month window it has granted to Iran. Will there be any genuine attempts to find common ground with Tehran on 2015 deal reached together with other Western powers to limit Iran’s nuclear programme? Or will the United States use to time to ensure that it can enforce the sanctions when the 180 days expires, while not causing oil prices to spike? It seems unlikely that Washington and Tehran could agree to re-work the nuclear deal in such a short time period, even if only relatively minor changes were made, similar to the re-worked North American Free Trade Agreement recently concluded by the Trump administration and Canada and Mexico. In the meantime, the oil market can probably cross Iran off its list of worries, but pencil it back for sometime around April next year.

2018-11-07,"(Adds tax, offshore details) CAPE TOWN, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Gabon plans to scrap a 35 percent corporate tax on energy companies as part of a revised hydrocarbons law and has launched a new offshore oil and gas exploration licensing round for 34 blocks, Oil Minister Pascal Ambouroue said on Wednesday. In March, Gabon, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, said it planned to revise its hydrocarbons code, under which the state holds a minimum 20 percent stake in oil projects, in a bid to attract new investment. “The purpose is to attract more and more investors,” Ambouroue told a media briefing at the Africa Oil Week conference in Cape Town in South Africa. Companies exploring offshore Gabon include Petronas, Noble Energy, ENI, Total and Shell . Addressing a seminar on the new fiscal terms replacing the 2014 petroleum code, a senior government official said besides scrapping the corporate tax, the new code set minimum royalty rates of 7 percent for oil and 4 percent for gas in conventional offshore zones, decreasing further to 5 percent for oil and 2 percent for gas in deep and ultra-deep waters. Income tax would be included in a “state profit share” and the formula for the profit split meant the state’s first tranche could not be lower than 50 percent for oil and 50 percent for gas in conventional offshore, and 45 percent for both hydrocarbons in deeper blocks. “The new hydrocarbon code is adopted for oil price fluctuations, gives flexibility to different plays and field sizes ... and the objective is to attract international oil companies,” said Bernardin Assoumou, the director general of hydrocarbons. State participation is 15 percent once a discovery has been made, he added. Ambouroue said the new code would likely become law before the end of December. Gabon, a tropical nation famed for its rain forests and wildlife, is a mid-tier African oil producer, churning out about 200,000 barrels of oil per day. “Marginal fields development by small independents sustain production now and production will decline below 150,000 barrels a day if nothing is done,” said Assoumou.

2018-11-07,"* Italian refiner to produce, market new marine fuel - CEO * Will initially produce 500,000-600,000 tonnes per year By Ron Bousso LONDON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Italian refiner Saras is constructing a ship-refueling terminal at its Sardinia plant and will market a new, cleaner marine fuel ahead of a major regulatory change in 2020, its chief executive told Reuters. From January 2020, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will ban ships from using fuels with a sulphur content above 0.5 percent, compared with 3.5 percent now, in one of the biggest changes in the oil market in decades. Refineries around the world have been gearing up for the switch by reducing output of high-sulphur fuel and upgrading plants to maximise production of the cleaner, more expensive fuel, which is similar to diesel. Saras is investing in infrastructure that will allow ships to dock outside its 300,000-barrels-per-day Sarroch refinery in Sardinia to directly load ultra-low-sulphur marine fuel oil (ULSFO), in what is known as bunkering, CEO Dario Scaffardi said. “Today, bunkering is based mainly on blending. In the Mediterranean you have Malta, where people bring different fuels and blend it. With the new specs, this (blending) will be very difficult to achieve for technical reasons so people like us, who will be able to produce directly the new fuel, will have the competitive advantage,” Scaffardi said. “With a small investment, we will have bunkering infrastructure and a lightering vessel and start selling locally fuels to expand the market.” The company did not disclose the size of the investment. Saras, one of Europe’s most modern refineries which also has a trading desk in Geneva, is developing its own ULSFO that the company will start marketing directly to shippers. The plant will initially produce 500,000 to 600,000 tonnes of ULSFO per year, he said. “This is a new line of business and we should be able to adapt to various market needs.” Reporting by Ron Bousso; Editing by Dale Hudson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/saras-imo/saras-invests-in-new-bunkering-terminal-ahead-of-imo-switch-idUKL8N1XH5YY,07 Nov 2018,"Italian refiner Saras is

2018-11-07,"PHNOM PENH, Nov 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Cambodia will push ahead with plans to use hydropower and coal to electrify the entire country by 2020, but solar energy will play some role, especially in remote areas, an energy ministry official said on Wednesday. The Southeast Asian nation has electrified rapidly since 2000, when only 16 percent of the population had access to power, according to the World Bank. Today, 87 percent of villages and 73 percent of households are connected to the grid, said Victor Jona, a spokesman for the department of energy at the Ministry of Mines and Energy. Hydropower accounts for 40 percent of the mix, while coal makes up 36 percent, with more plants being built, he said. Power imports from neighbouring countries contribute almost the entire remainder, with renewables such as solar accounting for less than 1 percent, he said. But Jona said the government has plans to develop more clean energy, especially in hard-to-reach communities. “We hope that solar home systems will do the role for the very remote areas, in case the grid cannot expand to them,” he said on the sidelines of a clean energy conference in the capital, Phnom Penh. Some larger-scale solar is also being added to the mix. Jona said construction of a 60 megawatt solar plant in Kampong Speu province, west of the capital, is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2019. A 10MW solar plant came online this year, he said, But hydropower and coal are still projected to make up 80 percent of Cambodia’s energy needs once the country achieves full electrification, Jona said. Coal-fired plants are under construction, and will contribute another 150MW by next year, he said. Bridget McIntosh, the Cambodia director for Energy Lab, which works to promote clean electricity, said the the country should consider adding more renewable energy to its mix, especially as the cost of solar power falls. “It takes five years to build a coal-fired station or a dam, and in those five years, the cost of solar will continue to decline,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “So it makes more sense to now connect solar to the grid” to meet the country’s electrification goals, she said. Moving away from coal can also help countries meet their Paris Agreement goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and help curb worsening climate impacts, including more extreme floods, droughts and sea level rise. Cambodia has committed to a 27 percent reduction in its climate-changing emissions by 2030, 16 percent of which will be achieved by promoting clean and more efficient energy. However, to scale up solar and other power, Cambodia must create a more welcoming regulatory environment for investment in it, said Pheakdey Heng, a founder of the Enrich Institute, a Phnom Penh-based think tank. That might include everything from providing greater transparency in issuing and revoking energy licenses to removing barriers to adopting solar energy, adopting energy efficiency standards and providing tax incentives for clean energy use, he said. Cambodia’s electrification so far has been largely driven by dams, and more are under consideration, including a controversial Sambor dam across the Mekong River, which is still in the “preliminary study” stage, according to Jona. But the benefits of dams have been highly overestimated, according to a study published this week by scientists from Michigan State University. Dams, the study said, often uproot people from their homes and damage biodiversity, while also releasing “large amounts” of climate-changing gases from rotting vegetation when water is released through spillways or passes through turbines.

The Democrats looked headed for a gain of more than 30 seats, well beyond the 23 they needed to claim their first majority in the House in eight years. With President Donald Trump’s Republican party holding onto its Senate majority, the results from Tuesday’s elections were in line with expectations. While gridlock in Washington could hamper Trump’s political and economic agenda, few expect a reversal of tax cutting and financial deregulation measures that have already been enacted. That view put all three New York equity indices on track for a strong opening, with S&P500 and Nasdaq futures up 1 percent and 1.3 percent respectively  while the Dow Jones was set to open up 0.8 percent by 1030 GMT. “The good news in a way for markets is that there was an uncertainty that’s now been removed. We know where we stand for the next two years, and investors will focus back on the fundamentals, which are (company) earnings growth and the economy,” said Guy Miller, chief market strategist at Zurich Insurance Group. Interactive chart on U.S. midterms tmsnrt.rs/2D6XH9t After volatile Asian trade, where stocks and the dollar swung on the Republicans’ fluctuating prospects, a pan-European stocks benchmark jumped around one percent while MSCI’s world equity index was up 0.5 percent. Sylvain Goyon, head of equity strategy at the Oddo brokerage in Paris, said many investors had been on the sidelines before the election, due to what he called “an uncertainty premium”. “Now it’s behind us, there’s a good reason for them to get back to the market,” he said. Most analysts agree the newly empowered House Democrats will have the ability to investigate Trump’s tax returns, possible business conflicts of interest and allegations involving his 2016 campaign’s links to Russia. Moreover, a split Congress will be able to hamper Trump’s push for a further round of tax cuts and deregulation - measures that have turbo-charged the U.S. economy, stock markets and the dollar. The Fed is expected to signal this week that an interest rate rise remains on the agenda for December. “Certainly it is now unlikely we will see additional fiscal stimulus in the near-term, that’s a profound change but there will be no repeal of what’s already in place,” Miller said. That view pushed the dollar 0.6 percent lower against a basket of currencies while 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yields fell to a low of 3.176 percent as it became clear that more fiscal stimulus was unlikely. An initial knee-jerk rise to 3.25 percent came after early reports of a better-than-expected performance by the Republicans, but that move soon fizzled as results trickled in. Bond markets may remain under pressure from this week’s record volumes of longer-dated government debt supply and the yawning Federal deficit. Many also reckon more spending increases are still possible. “Even with a split government, I expect more fiscal stimulus ahead. There is some possibility for compromise on infrastructure spending as well,” said Steve Friedman, a senior economist at BNP Paribas Asset Management. Attention will also focus on Trump’s hard line on trade tariffs, which he can impose without Congressional approval. That keeps alive worries about a trade war between China and the United States. Chinese shares closed 0.7 percent lower, while Hong Kong markets ended just above flat. “We would argue that if Trump can do less on the domestic front, he is more likely to focus on external matters such as trade, which will impact risk sentiment,” said Patrick O’Donnell, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management in London. The dollar’s weakness boosted other currencies. Against the yen, the greenback eased 0.4 percent to 113.06, reversing earlier gains to a one-month high of 113.82 yen. The euro rose 0.6 percent to $1.1496, a two-week high, while the British pound gained 0.5 percent to $1.3168, rising for a third straight day after a BBC report that Britain was preparing for a Brexit deal by end-November.

2018-11-07,"* First boiling water reactor to get extension * Upgrades needed before operations can start * Restart not likely until the 2020s * Approvals also needed from local authorities (Recasts, adds comment) By Aaron Sheldrick and Osamu Tsukimori TOKYO, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Japan’s nuclear regulator has approved an operations extension for a 40-year-old reactor near Tokyo that was damaged in the same earthquake and tsunami that sparked the Fukushima disaster nearly eight years ago, a move likely to be controversial. The reactor, Tokai Daini, also has the same basic design as those that melted down in the Fukushima crisis and will be the first boiling water reactor (BWR) to be approved for a lifetime extension of 20 years. The approval will be a boost for operator, Japan Atomic Power Co (Japco), which is owned by the country’s main utilities and is bleeding cash because of the shutdown of its two nuclear power units. Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority gave the green light to the extension on Wednesday, the regulator said. Tokai Daini is 115 km (62 miles) northeast of central Tokyo, the closest reactor to the capital, and has nearly a million people living within a 30 kilometre radius. “It’s impossible to evacuate these people all at once, and no matter how much time is spent on them it won’t be possible to set up escape plans,” said Toru Umino, mayor of nearby Naka city, on Oct. 24 to a group of citizens opposed to nuclear power, according to a video posted on local media. Umino has been one of the few public officials to come out in opposition to the Tokai Daini extension. A call to mayoral staff on Wednesday went unanswered after office hours. Naka is one of five municipalities near Tokai village, where the reactor is located, that have an agreement with Japco to be consulted on any restart, although they don’t have veto rights. Tokai also has atomic research and other facilities, and was the site of a nuclear crisis in 1999, when workers at a processing plant not connected to Tokai Daini attempted to mix uranium in a bucket. Two workers died and 300,000 people were told to stay indoors for up to 30 hours, after radiation escape into surrounding areas. At the time it was the world’s worst nuclear incident since Chernobyl in 1986, based on an international rating scale. Local opposition to the extension of the Tokai plant has been strong, according to Japanese media, although residents often will not give their views. “It’s very difficult to express one’s opinions around here,” said Alison Watts, an Australian who works as a translator and has lived in Tokai for 25 years. Watts said she was opposed to the restart because the design of the reactors is similar to those at Fukushima and because of the threat of more big earthquakes. A company spokesman told Reuters the nuclear operator will build a tsunami protection wall to fortify Tokai Daini. Japan Atomic must also complete safety upgrades, with a restart of the plant is not expected till the 2020s. Japan Atomic will need the approval of Tokai and prefectural authorities as well before it can resume operations. Tokai Daini was operating when a massive earthquake struck off the northeast coast of Japan on March 11, 2011, creating a tsunami that swamped Tokyo Electric Power’s Fukushima Daichi station 113 kilometres to the north, causing explosions and meltdowns at three reactors. The Tokai Daini plant shut down automatically but sustained damage, according to Japan Atomic. While the extension will be a further boost for Japan’s resurgent nuclear industry, the sector will still miss a government target of providing at least a fifth of the country’s electricity by 2030, an analysis by Reuters showed last week. Nine reactors have restarted, all of them pressurized water reactors located far from Tokyo, while the stigma of Fukushima still hangs over use of the older BWR technology.

2018-11-07,"(Reuters) - Washington state was heading toward rejecting a ballot initiative to create the first carbon tax in the United States, a tally of about 80 percent of votes showed early on Wednesday, after an oil industry campaign argued it would hurt the economy. The Carbon Emissions Fee and Revenue Allocation Initiative, known as Initiative 1631, would have imposed a $15 fee on each metric ton of carbon emissions, rising $2 a year until the state’s 2035 emissions target is met.  With more than two million votes counted by early Wednesday, the “no” votes were leading with 56.3 percent. The Seattle Times and other local media outlets reported that the measure had failed, although a spokesman for the “Yes on 1631” campaign said it was not ready to concede given some 540,000 ballots remained to be counted.  The carbon fee aimed to generate $2.3 billion over five years for clean energy and air programs, according to a state analysis. The oil industry was expected to feel most pain because transport contributes 43 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Washington state, a 2016 state report said. The Western States Petroleum Association raised $31.2 million from oil companies and business groups to oppose the measure, the most spent in the state to defeat a ballot initiative, according to state campaign finance data. That fueled months of television and digital ads, along with flyers and mailers in the state that argued the fee would drive up energy costs for consumers, small businesses and farms.   Top donors to the “No on 1631” campaign included BP America, Phillips 66 and Marathon Oil Corp unit Andeavor. All three own refineries in the state. Big Oil raised double the $15.2 million spent on supporting the initiative by an alliance of green groups and billionaire activists including Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg. The big-ticket battle reflected the stakes of climate regulation. The oil industry worries new curbs on carbon emissions will hobble business, while environmentalists worry that a failure to act soon to halt global warming will have devastating consequences for the planet. Washington is the nation’s fifth biggest fuel-producing state with five refineries. Those facilities last year produced about 5.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to the Environmental Protection agency, an amount that would yield the state over $83 million in revenue from the tax.

2018-11-07,"* Vestas says prices have stabilised * Shares rise on upbeat comments * Third-quarter profit below forecast (Adds CFO, analyst, shares) By Stine Jacobsen COPENHAGEN, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Wind turbine maker Vestas said on Wednesday it expected higher sales and activity levels next year as immense pricing pressure in the industry eases. The wind industry has suffered a steep decline in prices the past years as subsidies taper off and governments opt for more competitive contract tenders. However, Vestas said prices had now stabilised, echoing comments made by its main rival Siemens Gamesa which set the bar high on Tuesday when it said it expected a 10 percent rise in sales next year. “We are very happy with the development in pricing, we see that prices are definitely stabilised,” Chief Financial Officer Marika Fredriksson told Reuters. The upbeat comments on pricing overshadowed below-forecast third-quarter profit and Vestas shares rose 4.3 percent though they slightly lagged Siemens Gamesa shares which were up around 5 percent. Vestas’ order intake in the third quarter came with an average selling price of 0.78 million euros per megawatt, compared with the 0.72 million expected by analysts and the 0.71 million achieved in the second quarter. “This confirms that the price pressure in the industry is on the decline, there is a stabilisation, and Vestas is on its way towards record high activity levels in 2019,” Sydbank analyst Jacob Pedersen, who kept his ‘buy’ rating, said. Vestas sales grew 2.5 percent in the quarter, while operating profit before special items fell 22 percent to 276 million euros ($316.13 million), lagging a forecast for 285 million in a Reuters poll of analysts. Siemens Gamesa reported on Tuesday a 12 percent rise in revenues for the July-September period. Vestas’ wind turbine orders in the quarter rose 25 percent to 3,261 megawatt (MW), slightly below the 3,330 MW expected by analysts, bringing its order backlog to an all-time high. Vestas said it now expects 2018 free cash flow of minimum 100 million euros from a previous guidance of minimum 400 million, due to “higher total investments and an increased activity level resulting in higher net working capital”. It kept its forecast for revenues of 10-10.5 billion euros this year and an EBIT margin before special items of 9.5-10.5 percent.

However, the fast-growing carrier, which mainly serves passengers in central and eastern Europe, said it was better placed to cope with rising fuel prices than many rivals. It pointed to its ultra-low cost model and expansion plans based on the arrival of new, more fuel-efficient planes next year. “I don’t think that the high fuel price environment is necessarily a structurally bad thing for Wizz Air,” CEO Jozsef Varadi told Reuters in an interview. “It helps the market consolidate and makes the stronger airlines even stronger.” Shares in Wizz, which said full-year results would also suffer a 10 million euro hit from air traffic control strikes and congested airports in the summer, were down 2.3 percent to 2,605 pence at 0815 GMT, paring an earlier drop of 8 percent. Jet fuel price are around 23 percent higher than a year ago. That helped to push Cyprus-based Cobalt Air and Denmark-based Primera Air out of business in October. Larger airlines have also suffered. Ryanair cut its profit forecast in October, while easyJet has said the outlook for revenues per seat for the six months to March is negative. In the short term, Wizz said it would mitigate higher fuel prices by reining in costs and reducing second-half capacity growth to 14 percent from a previously planned 18 percent, helping to boost ticket prices. “While the pull-back in the full-year guidance is disappointing, second-half guidance is in line and the strong pricing momentum is impressive,” Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson said. Further ahead, Wizz is due to receive its first A321neo in early 2019 and by the end of its next financial year will operate 12 of the bigger jets that burn 16 percent less fuel. RBC said the weakness in Wizz’s share price - it has lost a third of its value in the year to date against 15 percent falls at Ryanair and easyJet - was a buying opportunity. “Wizz shares could double by 2021 - so worth wading into a short-term adverse momentum current,” analyst Damian Brewer said. Wizz forecast net profit for the 12 months to March 31, 2019, would come in between 270 and 300 million euros, compared with previous guidance of 310-340 million euros. $1 = 0.8711 euros

2018-11-07,"* U.S. futures, European shares gain as election outcomes in line with expectations * Trade worries likely to remain despite Democrats’ win * Dollar tumbles 0.4 pct, US yields fall on stimulus doubts * Midterm election interactive  tmsnrt.rs/2D6XH9t (Updates throughout, changes byline dateline) By Sujata Rao LONDON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set for a modestly firmer open on Wednesday and global stocks rose after significant U.S. election gains for the opposition Democrats, but the outcome may rule out further tax cuts, sending the dollar and Treasury yields sharply lower. The Democrats look headed to gain more than 30 seats, well beyond the 23 they needed to claim their first majority in the House in eight years. With President Donald Trump’s Republican party holding onto its Senate majority, the results from Tuesday’s elections were in line with expectations. Moreover, while gridlock in Washington could hamper Trump’s political and economic agenda, few expect a reversal of tax cutting and financial deregulation measures that have already been enacted. That view helped all three New York equity indexes to rise around 0.7 percent on Tuesday and they looked set to build on those gains, with S&P500 and Nasdaq futures up 0.7 percent and 1.25 percent respectively . Market sentiment had been volatile in Asian trade with stocks and the dollar swinging on the Republicans’ fluctuating prospects of retaining the House. But by 0900 GMT, MSCI’s world equity index was up 0.3 percent, while a pan-European stocks benchmark jumped around one percent . “The good news in a way for markets is that there was an uncertainty that’s now been removed. We know where we stand for the next two years and investors will focus back on the fundamentals which are (company) earnings growth and the economy,” said Guy Miller, chief market strategist at Zurich Insurance Group. On the other hand, most agree the newly empowered House Democrats will have the ability to investigate Trump’s tax returns, possible business conflicts of interest and allegations involving his 2016 campaign’s links to Russia. Moreover, a split Congress will be able to hamper Trump’s push for a further round of tax cuts and deregulation - measures that have turbo-charged the U.S. economy, stock markets and the dollar, keeping the Federal Reserve on a policy-tightening path. The Fed is expected to signal this week that an interest rate rise remains on the agenda for December. “Certainly it is now unlikely we will see additional fiscal stimulus in the near-term, that’s a profound change but there will be no repeal of what’s already in place,” Miller said. That view pushed the dollar 0.4 percent lower against a basket of currencies. Against the yen, it was 0.4 percent lower at 113.06, reversing earlier gains to a one-month high of 113.82 yen. The euro rose almost half a percent to $1.148 a two-week high, while the British pound gained 0.4 percent to $1.315, clinging to three-week highs hit after Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab indicated on Tuesday that a deal on exiting the European Union was likely. On bond markets, ten-year U.S. Treasury bond yields fell below 3.18 percent, down four basis points on the day as it became clear that more fiscal stimulus was unlikely. An initial knee-jerk rise to 3.25 percent came after early reports of a better-than-expected performance by the Republicans, but that move soon fizzled as results trickled in. The bond market may remain under pressure from this week’s record volumes of longer-dated government debt supply and the yawning Federal deficit. Many also reckon more spending increases are still possible. “There are still areas with compromise for spending, so even with a split government I expect more fiscal stimulus ahead. There is some possibility for compromise on infrastructure spending as well,” Steve Friedman, a senior economist at BNP Paribas Asset Management, said. Attention will also focus on Trump’s hard line on trade tariffs, which he can impose without Congressional approval. That keeps alive worries about a trade war between China and the United States. Chinese shares closed 0.7 percent lower, while Hong Kong markets ended just above flat “We would argue that if Trump can do less on the domestic front he is more likely to focus on external matters such as trade, which will impact risk sentiment,” said Patrick O’Donnell, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management in London. Oil prices were soft after a 2 percent fall the previous day, with Brent crude futures down 0.25 percent to  just below $72 a barrel.

2018-11-07,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he expects to meet again with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un early next year and that a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korean officials supposed to have taken place this week would be rescheduled. Pompeo had been due to hold talks in New York on Thursday with senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol aimed at paving the way for a second summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un and at making progress on denuclearization. The State Department said early on Wednesday that the meeting had been postponed, but gave no reason, raising concerns that talks aimed at persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear arms could break down. The State Department said the talks would be rescheduled “when our respective schedules permit.” Trump told a White House news conference the change was  “because of trips that are being made,” but did not elaborate on these.”We are going to make it ... another day,” he said. “But we’re very happy with how it’s going with North Korea. We think it’s going fine. We’re in no rush.” Trump said he still expected to hold a second summit with Kim. “Some time next year, I would say. Sometime early next year,” he said. Kim pledged to work towards denuclearization at an unprecedented first meeting with Trump in Singapore but negotiations have made little headway since, with North Korea falling short of U.S. demands for irreversible moves to abandon a weapons program that potentially threatens the United States. Pyongyang has complained that Washington has not made concessions in return for the moves it has taken and last Friday warned it could resume development of its nuclear program if the United States did not drop its sanctions campaign. The Trump administration has said that sanctions will not be lifted until North Korea gives up its weapons. “The sanctions are on. ... I’d love to take the sanctions off, but they (North Korea) have to be responsive, too,” Trump said on Wednesday. The State Department said “conversations continue to take place,” with North Korea, and added: “The United States remains focused on fulfilling the commitments agreed to by President Trump and Chairman Kim at the Singapore summit in June.”  South Korea, which has worked to encourage U.S.-North Korea dialogue, sought to play down the talks delay. South Korean foreign minister Kang Kyung-wha said on Thursday the North had suggested a postponement. “The North side said ‘both of our schedules are busy, so let’s postpone,’” Kang said, according what she was told by the United States.  Presidential spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said Seoul did not believe it would mean that the second summit would not take place and a senior South Korean foreign ministry official said that while the rescheduling was regrettable, there was no need to “overthink the postponement”. “I think we have to look at it as a part of the process of reaching complete denuclearization and setting up a peace regime,” the unnamed official told reporters. Trump spoke after his Republican Party lost control of the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday after the Democrats rode a wave of dissatisfaction with his presidency in mid-term elections. Some analysts believe this weakened state could impact Trump’s foreign policy and test his North Korean diplomatic gambit.  While Republicans maintained control of the Senate, the Democrats now have the opportunity to block Trump’s agenda and open his administration to intense scrutiny. Democrats have said they are determined to obtain more information about meetings between Trump and Pompeo and Kim, worried that Trump is so eager to make a “great deal” that he will give Kim too much with little in return. North Korea has for years pursued nuclear and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions but the bellicose rhetoric from both Pyongyang and Trump that raised fears of war has eased this year.

2018-11-07,"* APA’s sheer size raises foreign ownership concern * Investors had doubts bid would be cleared * APA shares last traded 14 pct below offer price (Adds treasurer comments, share price, context) MELBOURNE, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Australia is poised to bar Hong Kong-based CK Group going ahead with a A$13 billion ($9.4 billion) takeover of the country’s biggest gas pipeline company, APA Group, based on a preliminary view that it would be against the national interest. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said on Wednesday he would make a final decision within two weeks, saying that his preliminary view “reflects the size and significance of APA Group”. “I have formed this view on the grounds that it would result in an undue concentration of foreign ownership by a single company group in our most significant gas transmission business,” Frydenberg said in a statement. CK Infrastructure Holdings, part of the empire founded by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, is leading a consortium which offered A$11 a share for APA in what would be the third biggest takeover, including debt, of an Australian company, according to Refinitiv data. APA’s spokesman had no immediate comments. CK Infrastructure said in a statement it had noted the treasurer’s comments. The decision, based on advice from the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Critical Infrastructure Centre, comes even after the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission cleared the takeover in September but was not a total surprise. Investors had doubts the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) and the treasurer would allow the takeover amid concerns about gas supply and soaring energy prices, which have become hot political issues. As a result, APA’s shares have been trading well below the A$11 offer price. The stock last traded at A$9.51 ahead of the Treasurer’s announcement. FIRB had mixed views on the bid. “The FIRB was unable to reach a unanimous recommendation, expressing its concerns about aggregation and the national interest implications of such a dominant foreign player in the gas and electricity sectors over the longer term,” Frydenberg said. He said the competition commission had not considered the question of concentration of foreign ownership. CK Infrastructure, which had been confident of securing approval for its takeover of APA, already owns several power and gas network assets across Australia. However, Frydenberg said the sheer size of APA, with 15,000 kilometres (9,320 miles) of pipelines, including 74 percent of pipelines in the most populous states of New South Wales and Victoria, raised concerns about foreign ownership. Frydenberg, who until August was energy minister, said he was not opposed to CK Group or its subsidiaries. “The Australian government welcomes CK Group’s investments in Australia and its broader contribution to the Australian economy,” he said. Last year, CK Infrastructure received approval for a A$7.4 billion takeover of pipeline owner DUET Group. It has only been blocked on one previous deal, when it bid with China’s State Grid for the nation’s biggest electricity network Ausgrid in 2016. Fairfax Media reported that acquisition was blocked as Ausgrid served an Australian spy facility. Earlier this year, Australia banned China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd from supplying equipment for a 5G mobile network citing national security risks, straining relations with Beijing.

But European stocks were expected to rise, with spread-betters looking at gains of up to 0.5 percent in Britain’s FTSE, 0.8 percent in France’s CAC and 0.7 percent in Germany’s DAX. The Democrats’ House win creates a hurdle for Republicans to easily pass legislation through both chambers of Congress, clouding the outlook for some of Trump’s key economic proposals. Major U.S. broadcasters projected the Democrats were headed to a gain of more than 30 seats, well beyond the 23 they needed to claim their first majority in the House in eight years, while the Republicans were seen gaining a few more seats in the Senate. While both outcomes were broadly in line with market expectations, a reason markets did not sell off, the prospect of political gridlock creates some uncertainty for investors. The dollar weakened against most of its major counterparts. “In the short term, a Republican loss in the House should amplify risk market volatility, detract from positive sentiment, and be positive for U.S. rates,” said Ed Al-Hussainy, senior rates and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle Investments at Minneapolis in the United States. “Long dollar and short Treasury futures positioning is relatively stretched going into tonight and could exaggerate short term moves in these prices,” he added. In addition, the newly empowered House Democrats will have the ability to investigate Trump’s tax returns, possible business conflicts of interest and allegations involving his 2016 campaign’s links to Russia. In equities markets, U.S. S&P500 futures last traded 0.1 percent higher and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan were up a similar amount, but they were far off highs hit earlier. Japan’s Nikkei ended down 0.3 percent, giving up morning gains. “It has clearly become difficult for Republicans to pass additional tax cuts or amendments to Dodd-Frank regulations (on financial institutions) for instance,” said Tomoaki Shishido, fixed income analyst at Nomura Securities. Market sentiment had been volatile in Asian trade with stocks and the dollar swinging on the Republicans’ fluctuating prospects of retaining the House. While a split Congress would put a brake on Trump’s agenda, such as tax cuts or deregulation, some investors think the Democrats may agree to more spending. “There are still areas with compromise for spending, so even with a split government I expect more fiscal stimulus ahead. There is some possibility for compromise on infrastructure spending as well,” said Steve Friedman, New York-based senior economist at BNP Paribas Asset Management. “If there is additional fiscal stimulus, it suggests that fiscal policy is more of a tailwind for U.S. growth and it should, all things equal, be supportive for stocks.” On the other hand, many investors expect Trump to continue to take a hard line on tariffs, which he can impose without Congressional approval, and foreign policy. That keeps alive worries about a trade war between China and the United States. Trump’s massive tax cut, enacted in December, and a spending agreement reached in Congress in February have helped lift the U.S. economy, but they have also widened the federal budget deficit. As a result, Treasury supply has been growing, pushing U.S. bond yields higher. The election results pushed down the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield about 2.5 basis points to 3.189 percent, off its seven-year high of 3.261 percent touched a month ago. But the debt market also remains under pressure from this week’s record volumes of longer-dated government debt supply. In the currency market, the dollar dipped. Against the yen, it was 0.3 percent lower at 113.13, reversing earlier gains to one-month high of 113.82 yen. The euro rose 0.15 percent to $1.1446 and the British pound gained 0.1 percent to $1.3117, hitting a three-week high. Sterling extended gains made the previous day on hopes of a Brexit deal breakthrough after Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said “Thumbs Up” on his way out of a cabinet meeting. That helped sterling recover losses following remarks from a senior member of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party earlier that it looked like Britain would exit the EU without a deal. Oil prices were soft after a 2 percent fall the previous day. U.S. crude futures hit an eight-month low as Washington granted sanction waivers to top buyers of Iranian oil and as Iran said it has so far been able to sell as much oil as it needs to. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures traded 0.6 percent lower at $61.85 a barrel having hit a low of $61.31 on Tuesday, the weakest price since March 16.

The Democrats’ House win creates a clear hurdle for Republicans to easily pass legislation through both chambers of Congress, clouding the outlook for some of Trump’s key economic proposals.

2018-11-07,"Nov 7 (Reuters) - Colorado voters on Tuesday rejected a measure calling for greater distances between oil and gas drilling and public spaces, a move opponents said would have sharply limited new wells in the fifth-largest oil producing state in the nation. The measure was headed for defeat in an election that saw oil companies pour millions of dollars into efforts to combat the proposal. Shares of producers active in the state, including Anadarko Petroleum Corp, Noble Energy Inc and Devon Energy Corp, have been under pressure since the citizens’ initiative won a spot on the ballot. Known as Proposition 112, the measure would have mandated at least 2,500 feet (762 m) of separation between new drilling activities and occupied or vulnerable areas. It garnered about 43 percent of votes with more than three quarters of precincts reporting, according to data from the Colorado Secretary of State’s office. Passage required a majority of votes. Shares of Anadarko rose 8 cents to $54.77 on Tuesday, Devon was down 17 cents at $32.99 and Noble rose 10 cents to $27.03. Opponents said the measure would have cost Colorado’s economy between $169 billion and $217 billion over 12 years, and would have cut state and local tax revenues by $7 billion to $9 billion. Oil production in the state was up 26 percent year-over-year to 477,000 barrels per day, according to the latest U.S. government figures. “This measure was an extreme proposal that would have had devastating impacts across the state on jobs, education and numerous other programs,” said Chip Rimer, a senior vice president at Noble and chairman of the Colorado Oil & Gas Association. Municipal officials, including Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, urged voters to reject the measure, warning that it would hurt jobs and reduce tax revenues for schools, roads and public safety. The rejection was another setback for environmentalists who in 2016 failed to get a similar initiative placed on the ballot. Colorado Rising, an anti-fracking group that helped get the measure on the ballot, was vastly outspent but campaigned door-to-door and used phone and text messages to sway voters. “The outcome does not change the fact fracking operations are dangerous and should not be happening so close to Colorado homes, schools and drinking water,” said Colorado Rising’s Russell Mendell. “We will not stop until our Colorado neighborhoods are safe from this dangerous industrial activity.” Ahead of Tuesday’s vote, energy executives warned passage ultimately could lead them to reduce drilling in the state, although several said they expected no immediate impact.

2018-11-07,"TOKYO, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Japan’s nuclear regulator approved an extension of operations for a 40-year-old reactor near Tokyo that has the same basic design as those that melted down in the Fukushima crisis nearly eight years ago, a move that is likely to be controversial. The reactor, Tokai Daini, is the first boiling water reactor (BWR) to be approved for a lifetime extension of 20 years. The approval will be a boost for operator, Japan Atomic Power Co, which is owned by the country’s main utilities and is bleeding cash because of the shutdown of its two nuclear power units. Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority approved the extension at a meeting of its commissioners on Wednesday, it said. Japan Atomic must complete safety upgrades, and a company spokesman told Reuters the nuclear operator will build a tsunami protection wall to fortify Tokai Daini. A restart of the plant is not expected till the 2020s. Japan Atomic will also need the approval of local and prefectural authorities before it can resume operations. Tokai Daini was operating when a massive earthquake struck off the northeast coast of Japan on March 11, 2011, creating a tsunami that swamped Tokyo Electric Power’s Fukushima Daichi plant to the north, causing explosions and meltdowns at three reactors. The Tokai Daini plant sustained damage, but shut down automatically, according to Japan Atomic. While the extension will be a further boost for Japan’s resurgent nuclear industry, the sector will still miss a government target of providing at least a fifth of the country’s electricity by 2030, an analysis by Reuters showed last week. Nuclear power remains an unpopular energy option in Japan and the country will reboot only a fraction of the 54 reactors it had before the 2011 disaster. Six reactors at Fukushima Daiichi are being dismantled in a decades-long exercise that is fraught with technological challenges and hampered by radioactive waste. Operators have also decided to decommission a further 10 units across the country since Fukushima. Nine reactors have restarted, all of them pressurized water reactors located far from Tokyo, while the stigma of Fukushima still hangs over use of the older BWR technology.

2018-11-07,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - France’s Dassault Aviation SA (AVMD.PA) has withdrawn its Rafale fighter from the race to supply Canada with 88 new military jets, three sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. The move means that four manufacturers are left in the competition, which Canadian officials say will be worth between C$15 billion ($11.4 billion) and C$19 billion. Canada is due to issue its final requirement for the fleet next May. Defense sources have long said the Canadian air force favors a U.S. plane, either the Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) F-35 or Boeing Co’s (BA.N) F-18 Super Hornet. Canada’s Liberal government, stung by a series of procurement mishaps over previous decades, insists the contest will be an open one despite the armed forces’ close links to the U.S. military and widespread use of American equipment.  The three sources, who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the situation, said Dassault was not convinced it could meet the necessary security requirements. France does not belong to the so-called Five Eyes group of nations that share top secret intelligence - Canada, the United States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand. This would have made operating with U.S. forces complicated, the sources said. Sweden’s Saab AB (SAABb.ST), one of the four remaining contenders, faces the same challenge with its Gripen jet.  The Airbus (AIR.PA) consortium, makers of the Eurofighter, includes Five Eyes member Britain. The office of federal Procurement Minister Carla Qualtrough, in overall charge of major military purchases, said it was looking into the reported withdrawal. Canada has been trying unsuccessfully for almost a decade to buy replacements for its aging F-18 fighters, some of which are 40-years old. The former Conservative administration said in 2010 it would buy 65 F-35 jets but later scrapped the decision, triggering years of delays and reviews. Canada is a member of the international consortium that developed the F-35. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau came to power in 2015 vowing not to buy the plane on the grounds that it was too costly, but Ottawa has since softened its line.

2018-11-07,"* Shares gain pared, chance of GOP retaining House seen trimmed * Dollar erases losses, U.S. bond yields near 7-year peak * Trade worries likely to remain regardless of election outcome By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Wall Street stock futures and Asian shares erased most of their earlier gains in choppy trade on Wednesday, as results from the U.S. midterm elections showed Republicans close to losing their grip on Congress. U.S. S&P500 futures were last up 0.15 percent, paring most of their 0.6 percent gain earlier, as the latest results improved the odds of opposition Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives. The congressional elections is billed as a referendum on President Donald Trump’s polarising style and “America First” policies. Investor sentiment has been volatile in Asian trade with stocks and the dollar swinging on the Republicans’ fluctuating prospects of retaining the House. By late morning, broadcasters were projecting the Democrats to have wrested control of the House. Asian shares retained most of their gains but were off their highs with MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan up 0.3 percent while Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.2 percent. Leading into the election, investors had expected the Democrats to gain a majority in the House and, as a result, remained sceptical about Trump’s proposal late last month on tax cuts for middle-income households. Market participants had previously said a surprise House win by the Republicans could boost the chances of further tax cuts and pro-business policies while a Democrats’ victory was likely to have already been priced in. In the U.S. Senate race, the Republicans held an upper hand, unseating a Democratic incumbent in Indiana, which Democrats badly needed to win that chamber. “The House results so far are showing a better than expected performance for the Republicans, even if they don’t keep the House,” said Steven Englander, global head of G10 FX research at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. “So it doesn’t look like a big blue wave and Republicans might do a bit better than expected in the Senate and the market is therefore reacting with a stronger dollar, higher U.S. yields and higher U.S. equities,” he said. On the other hand, many investors also expect Trump to continue to take a hard line on tariffs, which he can impose without Congressional approval. That keeps alive worries about a trade war between China and the United States. Trump’s massive tax cut, enacted in December, and a spending agreement reached in February have helped lift the U.S. economy, but they have also widened U.S. federal budget deficit. As a result, Treasury supply has been growing, pushing U.S. bond yields higher. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell about 1 basis points to 3.193 percent, near its seven-year high of 3.261 percent touched a month ago, as investors sold ahead of this week’s record amounts of longer-dated government debt supply. Oil prices were soft after a 2 percent fall the previous day, with U.S. crude futures hitting an eight-month low as Washington granted sanction waivers to top buyers of Iranian oil and as Iran said it has so far been able to sell as much oil as it needs to.

2018-11-07,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - In the end, President Donald Trump kicked the Iran crude oil sanctions can six months down the road, raising questions as to how the various players in the dispute will use the time. The U.S. government granted waivers to eight buyers of Iranian crude, exempting them from the sanctions that came into effect this week that are aimed at reducing exports from the Islamic Republic to zero. The waivers will allow the eight countries, which include top buyers China and India, to keep buying crude for another 180 days, a move aimed at reducing the shock of a sudden loss of all Iranian exports. There are a number of ways of looking at the U.S. decision to grant waivers to countries which together account for some 80 percent of Iran’s total oil exports. The first would be that Trump and his administration effectively blinked first in their dispute with Iran over its nuclear and missile programmes. It could also be argued that it was a rare example of ‘realpolitik’ from the Trump administration, with the tacit recognition that cutting Iran’s exports to zero in one fell swoop would boost crude prices, hurting not only U.S. consumers but also the rest of the world. Trump was keen to talk up his administration’s capability of completely isolating Iran. But perhaps with an eye on the mid-term U.S. elections on Tuesday, he made it clear that keeping crude prices low was also a priority.  “I could get the Iran oil down to zero immediately but it would cause a shock to the market. I don’t want to lift oil prices,” Trump told reporters on Nov. 5 before flying to a campaign event. The decision to grant the waivers has already calmed oil markets, which hadn’t really anticipated Tehran’s exports dropping to zero but may have also been uncertain as to how much crude would actually be lost. Brent crude closed at $72.13 a barrel on Tuesday, down 1.4 percent from the close on Nov. 5., and down 15 percent from the four-year high of $84.79 reached on Oct. 3. Tanker-tracking and port data suggests that Iran has already suffered a fairly steep drop in exports prior to the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions. From some 2.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of exports in 2017, Iran’s exports dropped to around 2 million bpd in recent months, according to Refinitiv data. A further drop is on the cards for November, with the caveat that tracking Iran’s exports has become more difficult given that state-owned tankers are turning off their vessel-monitoring systems. With the granting of the waivers, it’s likely that Iran will be able to keep its exports at least around 1.1 million bpd, and possibly even as high as the 2 million bpd of recent months. For the Iranians, the 180-day waivers provides them with a financial lifeline and time to try and lobby support from other countries against Washington’s sanctions. For major buyers like China, which imported about 650,000 bpd of Iranian crude in the first 10 months of the year, the waivers allow it to maintain diversity of supply, as well as keeping prices lower. With Iranian barrels still in the market, the pressure on other major exporters like Saudi Arabia and Russia to ensure a well-supplied market - or risk Trump’s displeasure - is reduced. But they may not be happy if crude prices continue to weaken. The big question is how does the Trump administration use the six-month window it has granted to Iran. Will there be any genuine attempts to find common ground with Tehran on 2015 deal reached together with other Western powers to limit Iran’s nuclear programme? Or will the United States use to time to ensure that it can enforce the sanctions when the 180 days expires, while not causing oil prices to spike? It seems unlikely that Washington and Tehran could agree to re-work the nuclear deal in such a short time period, even if only relatively minor changes were made, similar to the re-worked North American Free Trade Agreement recently concluded by the Trump administration and Canada and Mexico. In the meantime, the oil market can probably cross Iran off its list of worries, but pencil it back for sometime around April next year.

2018-11-07,"* Shares gain as Republicans seen faring better than expected * Dollar erase losses, U.S. bond yields near 7-year peak * Trade worries likely to remain regardless of election outcome By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Wall Street stock futures and Asian shares erased losses to eke out small gains on Wednesday as early results of U.S. mid-term elections appeared to show Republicans improving their chances of retaining their grip on Congress. U.S. S&P500 futures were up 0.4 percent, clawing back earlier losses of 0.4 percent, and the dollar pared its decline, as Republicans were on track to pick up a few closely-contested seats on the East Coast. The congressional elections is billed as a referendum on President Donald Trump’s polarising style and “America First” policies. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.2 percent while Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.6 percent. “It seems like the Republicans have the real chance of taking not only the Senate but also the House. That appears to be boosting stocks,” said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities. Investors had expected the opposition Democrats to pick up at least 23 seats they need to gain a majority in the House and, as a result, remained sceptical about Trump’s proposal late last month on tax cuts for middle-income households. While the final results are still hours away, markets have reacted as a surprise victory by the Republicans could boost the chances of further tax cuts and pro-business policies. On the other hand, many investors also expect Trump to continue to take a hard line on tariffs, which he can impose without Congressional approval. That keeps alive worries about a trade war between China and the United States. Trump’s massive tax cut, enacted in December, and a spending agreement reached in February have helped lift the U.S. economy, but they have also widened U.S. federal budget deficit. As a result, Treasury supply has been growing, pushing U.S. bond yields higher. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield rose to at 3.224 percent , near its seven-year high of 3.261 percent touched a month ago, as investors sold ahead of this week’s record amounts of longer-dated government debt supply.

2018-11-07,"SHANGHAI, Nov 7 (Reuters) - A Westinghouse-designed AP1000 nuclear reactor on China’s east coast is ready to go into commercial operation after completing a test run, the China National Nuclear Power Corp (CNNP) said. The second unit at Sanmen in Zhejiang province will be the third AP1000 reactor to go into commercial operation in China. It completed a 168-hour full-power test run on Nov. 5, and has met commercial operation conditions, CNNP said in a statement posted on its website Tuesday. The first Sanmen unit went into commercial operation on Sept. 20. China gave the go-ahead to build four Westinghouse-designed AP1000 reactors in 2007, but the technology has been beset by years of delays as a result of safety concerns and unanticipated design problems.

2018-11-07,"(Adds background on Alberta oil sector, details on project) Nov 6 (Reuters) - Imperial Oil Ltd said on Tuesday that it would go ahead with the construction of its C$2.6 billion ($2 billion) Aspen project in northern Alberta, the first new oil sand development to be greenlighted since 2013. The Calgary, Alberta-based company, which is majority owned by Exxon Mobil, said it would start construction on the 75,000-barrel-per-day project in the fourth quarter of 2018 with first output expected in 2022. The Aspen project will use new recovery technology to lower emissions and water use and improve project economics, the company said. Alberta’s oil sands have been criticized for being more carbon intensive than other global crude operations. “We do not take investment decisions lightly, particularly in these challenging times,” said Imperial Chief Executive Rich Kruger in a statement. “This is the right technology at the right time to make a competitive investment.” Imperial said there is potential to further expand Aspen to 150,000 barrels per day, depending on project performance, and overall business and market conditions. The discount on Western Canadian crudes has hit record levels this year, as rising output from Alberta’s oil sands has run up against chock-full pipelines, leading to higher volumes stuck in storage. While crude by rail volumes are rising, hitting a record near 230,000 barrels per day in August, they are not yet at levels needed to clear the glut. The situation has prompted a number of major Canadian producers to say they will not go ahead with any new projects or expansions until more pipeline capacity is in place. But the situation is improving. Enbridge Inc said last week it expects its Line 3 project to be in service in late 2019, while TransCanada Corp said it is working to start construction on its Keystone XL pipeline next year. The last major oil sand project to be approved in Alberta was the Suncor Energy Inc-led Fort Hills project in 2013, which is now ramping up to full output.

2018-11-07,"* U.S. stock futures dip on signs of Democrats’ strong showing * Markets expect Democrats to win House, GOP to retain Senate * Dollar slips broadly, U.S. bond yields near 7-year peak By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Wall Street stock futures and Asian shares dropped on Wednesday as early results of the U.S. midterm elections started to trickle in, with investors bracing for the Republicans to lose their grip on Congress. U.S. S&P500 futures dropped 0.4 percent as Democrats are seen as likely to pick up a few closely-contested seats on the East Coast in the congressional elections, which is billed as a referendum on President Donald Trump’s polarising style and “America First” policies. The initial results also weighed on the dollar. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat in early trade while Japan’s Nikkei erased earlier gains. Voter turnout in national elections, normally lower when the presidency is not at stake, could be the highest for a midterm election in 50 years. The opposition Democrats are favoured by election forecasters to pick up the 23 seats they need to gain a majority in the House, but have slimmer chances of gaining control of the Senate, opinion polls show. “We, like many other market players, expect Democrats to take the House and to have a split Congress. That should mean Trump won’t be able to push for further tax cuts and could lead to a risk-off mood in markets,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. “But that is probably already factored in, so I would think any additional selling in stocks would be limited,” he said. Many investors also expect Trump to continue to take a hard line on tariffs, which he can impose without Congressional approval. That keeps alive worries about a trade war between China and the United States. Trump’s massive tax cut, enacted in December, and a spending agreement reached in February have helped lift the U.S. economy, but they have also widened U.S. federal budget deficit. As a result, Treasury supply has been growing, pushing U.S. bond yields higher. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield stood at 3.195 percent , near its seven-year high of 3.261 percent touched a month ago, as investors sold ahead of this week’s record amounts of longer-dated government debt supply. Oil prices were soft after a 2 percent fall the previous day, with U.S. crude futures hitting an eight-month low as Washington granted sanction waivers to top buyers of Iranian oil and as Iran said it has so far been able to sell as much oil as it needs to. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures traded down 0.7 percent at $61.79 a barrel having hit a low of $61.31 on Tuesday, the weakest price since March 16. The dollar slipped broadly on concerns about Republicans defeat in the House. The euro gained 0.3 percent to $1.1462, hitting a two-week high. The yen also rose 0.25 percent to 113.18 per dollar, bouncing back from a one-month low of 113.505 on Tuesday. The British pound gained 0.2 percent to $1.3126, a three-week high, extending gains on hopes of a Brexit deal breakthrough after Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said “Thumbs Up” on his way out of a cabinet meeting.

2018-11-07,"* Brent crude down by over 17 pct since Oct, WTI down 20 pct * Oil production rising in U.S., OPEC, Russia * Top-3 oil producers: tmsnrt.rs/2Rua0R8 * Iraq plans output rise to 5 mln bpd in 2019 * U.S. grants Iran’s biggest customers sanction waivers By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday to extend losses from the previous session, with markets well supplied amid rising production and U.S. sanction waivers that allow Iran’s biggest customers to continue buying its crude. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $61.79 per barrel at 0053 GMT, down 42 cents, or 0.7 percent, from their last settlement. International benchmark Brent was yet to trade. The increasingly well supplied market has turned sentiment, which until early October was largely bullish, pushing Brent to four-year highs of more than $86 per barrel ahead of the Iran sanctions. Brent and WTI have lost 17.4 and 19.7 percent in value respectively from their most recent peaks in early October. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at futures brokerage Forex.com, said he had become “quite bearish on oil prices”. Razaqzada pointed to lower demand growth forecasts, higher supply and Iran sanctions waivers to most its biggest buyers which would allow its crude exports “to remain around their current levels for a good few months still”. U.S. bank Morgan Stanley said “oil market fundamentals have softened (as) supply continues to come in higher-than-expected, particularly from the U.S., Middle East OPEC, Russia and Libya.” Output from the world’s top-3 producers Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia, broke through 33 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first time in October, meaning these three countries alone now meet more than a third of the almost 100 million bpd of global consumption. Iraq, the second-largest producer within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) behind Saudi Arabia, is targeting production capacity of 5 million bpd in 2019, up from 4.6 million bpd currently, Oil Minister Thamer Ghadhban said on Tuesday. “The market is well supplied, and we see a balanced rather than tight market ahead. This no longer supports our $85 per barrel year-end and 1H19 forecast,” Morgan Stanley said. Instead, the bank said it expected Brent to average around $77.5 per barrel to mid-2019. With production rising, crude inventories are also swelling. U.S. crude stocks climbed by 7.8 million barrels in the week ending Nov. 2 to 432 million, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed on Tuesday. Despite the increasingly well supplied market, Razaqzada warned that it was becoming “increasingly costly for inefficient producers to maintain output at current levels”. Venezuela’s crude production was in “free-fall” and could soon drop below 1 million bpd, the International Energy Agency’s Executive Director Fatih Birol warned on Tuesday, down from the more than 2 million bpd it averaged last year.

U.S. S&P500 futures dipped 0.25 percent as the first polls closes in parts of the country in the congressional elections, seen as a referendum on President Donald Trump’s polarising style and “America First” policies.
