2018-04-12,"(Adds comments by premiers of Alberta and British Columbia) By David Ljunggren OTTAWA, April 12 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will break off a foreign trip to hold an emergency meeting with the premiers of two provinces locked in a worsening dispute over an oil pipeline, officials said on Thursday. The unexpected development is a sign of the pressure building on Trudeau to solve a problem that could turn into a constitutional crisis. The federal Liberals are pitted against the Pacific province of British Columbia, which opposes plans by Kinder Morgan Canada to almost triple the capacity of its Trans Mountain pipeline from Alberta to the west coast. Ottawa, which approved the project in 2016, insists it has jurisdiction. The British Columbia government disagrees, citing the risk of a spill. Kinder Morgan Canada, fed up with the delays, is threatening to walk away unless the dispute is settled by May 31. Trudeau left on Thursday for a nine-day trip, starting with a summit in Peru on Friday and Saturday. He has invited Alberta Premier Rachel Notley - who backs the pipeline - and British Columbia Premier John Horgan to come to Ottawa on Sunday. Trudeau will resume his international trip after the meeting. Both premiers said they would attend the Ottawa session but made clear they were sticking to their positions. “This likely is not going to be the end of the story. It’s a first step,” a senior government official told Reuters, saying Trudeau would outline the various financial, regulatory and legal options for handling the crisis. It is the first time in decades that different levels of government in Canada have argued so openly over resources. Energy industry analysts said that unless the dispute is settled, Canada would become a much less attractive place for foreign investment. “I think there’s a hope we break the deadlock and the prime minister can get beyond the political public posturing,” said the official, who was not authorized to speak to the media and requested anonymity. “This is impacting market confidence and investor confidence.” Notley, who is threatening to cut oil supplies to British Columbia, told reporters in Alberta that she did not have any particular expectations for Sunday’s meeting. “As far as negotiations (go) ... there’s only one outcome for Alberta, that is, that the pipeline gets built,” she said. A source close to the matter said on Wednesday that Trudeau would put pressure on British Columbia to drop its resistance but would try to avoid tougher measures that might alienate voters who helped his Liberals win power. “I don’t feel there is any need for saber-rattling, for provocation or for threats,” Horgan told reporters. Ottawa and Notley’s government have indicated they might be prepared to invest public money in the pipeline expansion to keep the project alive. Shares of Kinder Morgan Canada held their gains following news of the Sunday meeting and closed up 5.5 percent at C$17.50. Notley said on Monday that if Trudeau did not step in, “the reverberations of that will tear at the fabric of (Canada) for many, many years to come.” Horgan reaffirmed his stance that Ottawa should refer the matter to the Supreme Court for clarification. Cabinet ministers have dismissed the idea, saying it was already clear the federal government had jurisdiction over major pipelines. Before he left for Peru on Thursday, Trudeau released a video filmed on the British Columbia coast in which he said: “I wouldn’t approve major pipeline projects if I wasn’t confident they could be done safely.” (Additional reporting by Leah Schnurr in Ottawa; Editing by Richard Chang and Peter Cooney)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/kinder-morgan-cn-pipeline-canada/update-3-canadas-trudeau-to-meet-premiers-on-pipeline-strife-idUKL1N1RP1AP,12 Apr 2018,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin

2018-04-12,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - The United States Coast Guard said on Thursday it had shut a 10-mile (16.1 km) stretch of the Mississippi River in downtown New Orleans after a vessel spilled oil into the river. New Orleans, which sits near the mouth of the Mississippi, is an important transit point for energy, metals and agriculture commodities moving to overseas and domestic markets. Vessel traffic was halted between mile markers 91 and 101, the Coast Guard said. No injuries were reported. The closing stalled 12 commercial vessels on the river, according to Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Third Class Travis Magee. It was unclear when that stretch of the waterway would be reopened, he said.  The Singapore-flagged vessel Pac Antares, which was carrying silicon manganese, hit a pier, causing the vessel’s diesel fuel to spill, a Coast Guard spokeswoman said. Authorities earlier had warned of strong river currents in the area due to spring snow melt.  Federal and state authorities were responding to the spill. The Pac Antares was moored at Nashville Avenue Wharf in New Orleans and the leak has been plugged, the maritime military service said.

2018-04-12,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday his administration may allow the sale of gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol year-round, which could help farmers by firing up corn demand but faces opposition from Big Oil. The proposal marks the latest move by the Trump administration to navigate the rival oil and corn constituencies as they clash over the nation’s biofuels policy. Oil refiners say the Renewable Fuel Standard requiring them to add biofuels into gasoline is costly and displaces petroleum, while the farm sector says the law provides critical support to growers. The Environmental Protection Agency currently bans the higher ethanol blend, called E15, during summer because of concerns it contributes to smog on hot days - a worry biofuels advocates say is unfounded.  Gasoline typically contains just 10 percent ethanol. “We’re going to be going probably, probably to 15 and we’re going to be going to a 12-month period,” Trump told reporters during a White House meeting.  “We’re going to work out something during the transition period, which is not easy, very complicated.” Earlier on Thursday, EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman said the agency “has been assessing the legal validity of granting an E15 waiver since last summer” and is awaiting an outcome from discussions with the White House, the Department of Agriculture and Congress before making any final decisions.    Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said the proposed shift to year-round E15 sales would be “very exciting news.” “It would be a great morale boost for rural America, and more importantly a real demand boost if it can be moved forward quickly,” he said in an interview. Under the RFS, the EPA sets the volume of ethanol and other biofuels that must be mixed into the nation’s fuel supply on a yearly basis - and a move to expand E15 sales could encourage the EPA to set those volumes higher in coming years.  Currently, refiners are required to blend around 15 billion gallons of ethanol into the nation’s fuel annually. Shares of major biofuels producers rose slightly after the announcement. Archer Daniels Midland Co shares gained  2.7 percent to close at $45.30. It was unclear, however, whether the move would help the refining sector - which has been lobbying hard instead for a cap on the price of blending credits that refiners must acquire to prove compliance with the RFS. Greater blending of ethanol through year-round E15 sales would theoretically increase supplies of the tradable credits, and thus reduce prices. But at the same time, more ethanol translates to a smaller share of petroleum-based fuel in American gas tanks, which would hurt refiner sales. The American Petroleum Institute, which represents big oil companies, issued a statement opposing Trump’s proposal to expand E15 sales, arguing that high-ethanol fuel can damage engines and is incompatible with certain boats, motorcycles and lawn mowers. “The industry plans to consider all options to prevent such a waiver. The RFS is broken and we continue to believe the best solution is comprehensive legislation,” API Downstream Group Director Frank Macchiarola said in the statement. Refiners’ shares were mixed after Trump’s comments, with Andeavor closing down 2.6 percent at $110.13 and Valero Energy Corp up 0.2 percent at $100.53.     Bids for benchmark D6 blending credits slipped to 34 cents on Thursday afternoon, after deals were struck at 37.5 cents ahead of the announcement, a U.S. trader said.

2018-04-12,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street led stocks higher globally on Thursday, more than offsetting declines in Asia, as an expected strong earnings season took front seat after U.S. President Donald Trump cast doubt over the timing of his threatened strike on Syria. The risk of clashes between Western powers and Russia in Syria over an alleged chemical attack eased somewhat as Trump reworded his Wednesday threat that missiles “will be coming” while taunting Russia for supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Trump wrote on Thursday that an attack on Syria “could be very soon or not so soon at all.” Later, he said decisions will be made “fairly soon.” Investors turned their focus to U.S. corporate earnings as BlackRock (BLK.N), the world’s largest asset manager, reported quarterly profit above Wall Street estimates with its shares up 1.5 percent. BlackRock’s results boosted bank shares .SPXBK, which were the largest gainers on Thursday, likely on bets that increased exchange traded funds trading will benefit their bottom lines. Higher U.S. Treasury yields also gave banks support. Analysts expect quarterly profit for U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index companies to rise 18.4 percent from a year ago, the biggest gain in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We’re hearing less talk of firing missiles and less talk of trade war. Earnings are coming up and expectations are high,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director of institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. The stock market, he said, is “returning to normal.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 293.6 points, or 1.21 percent, to 24,483.05, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 21.8 points, or 0.83 percent, to 2,663.99 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 71.22 points, or 1.01 percent, to 7,140.25. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.67 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.37 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 0.11 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.27 percent lower, while Japan's Nikkei .N225 lost 0.12 percent. The higher risk appetite as geopolitical tensions eased boosted U.S. Treasury yields. The safe-haven Japanese yen also fell. “There is less immediate concern about military strikes or action in Syria,” said Jim Vogel, interest rates strategist at FTN Financial in Memphis. “It doesn’t move it to the back-burner, but it allows you to look around and trade other things and that gives room for rates to rise just a little bit from their sort of cramped or compressed levels,” he said. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR last fell 14/32 in price to yield 2.8413 percent, from 2.79 percent late on Wednesday. The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last fell 26/32 in price to yield 3.0455 percent, from 3.005 percent late on Wednesday. Oil prices fell initially as geopolitical concerns eased somewhat, but later rose, supported partly by shrinking global oil inventories. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo told Reuters in New Delhi the global oil glut has effectively shrunk by nine-tenths since the start of 2017. “We have seen an accelerated shrinkage of stocks in storage from unparalleled highs of about 400 million barrels to about 43 million above the five-year average,” Barkindo said. U.S. crude CLc1 rose 0.43 percent to $67.11 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $72.09, up 0.04 percent on the day. Both are at levels not seen since 2014. The U.S. dollar index .DXY was on track to snap a four-day losing streak as it rose 0.21 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.3 percent to $1.2328. “It’s a reversal of the safe-haven trade that lifted the yen and the Swiss franc earlier in the week,” said Karl Schamotta, director of global product and market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto. The Japanese yen weakened 0.43 percent versus the greenback at 107.27 per dollar, while the dollar was up 0.48 percent against the Swiss franc CHF=. Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.4227, up 0.36 percent on the day. Safe-haven gold XAU= fell from an 11-week high as the dollar edged higher and investors booked profits.

2018-04-12,"(Adds background on companies in paragraph 20) By Jarrett Renshaw and Chris Prentice NEW YORK, April 12 (Reuters) - Global energy giants Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil have asked  U.S. regulators for exemptions to the nation’s biofuels policy that have historically been reserved for small companies in financial distress, according to sources familiar with the matter. The requests will add fuel to a raging dispute between Big Oil and Big Corn over how the Trump administration should manage the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard - a 2005 law that requires oil refiners to mix biofuels such as corn-based ethanol into the nation’s fuel supply, or buy government-awarded credits from other energy firms who do the blending. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has already issued an unusually high 25 hardship waivers to small refineries in recent months, according to an agency source, driving blending credit prices down and helping the oil industry reduce compliance costs. But the agency won’t name the firms receiving the exemptions, citing a concern over disclosing private company information. Both Chevron and Exxon, among the world’s most profitable energy companies, have asked EPA for waivers for their smallest facilities - Chevron’s 54,500 barrel-per-day refinery in Utah and the Exxon’s 60,000 bpd refinery in Montana, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters on condition of anonymity. The exemptions would free the plants from their obligation to hand in blending credits earned or purchased for 2017, which came due this year, the sources said. The disclosure of the Chevron and Exxon applications, which have not been previously reported, follow a Reuters report this month that the EPA has exempted three of ten refineries owned by Andeavor, one of the biggest U.S. refining companies. The waivers could save Andeavor $50 million or more in regulatory costs for the company’s 2016 obligations under the biofuels law. Husky Energy - a Canadian oil giant backed by a Hong Kong billionaire - will also be seeking an exemption, this one covering the 2018 requirements for its small Superior, Wisconsin plant, spokesman Mel Duval told Reuters, disclosing the waiver for the first time. Duval said Husky inherited a 2017 exemption when it bought the 50,000 bpd Superior refinery from Calumet Specialty Products Partners for $435 million in November. The waivers are intended for facilities producing less than 75,000 barrels per day (bpd) that can also prove compliance with the policy would cause them “disproportionate economic hardship.” The exceptions and the EPA’s refusal to disclose them have infuriated the corn lobby, which argues the waivers hurt farmers by undermining demand for corn and should be used only sparingly for tiny facilities in dire straits. A spokesman for Chevron, Braden Reddall, declined to confirm or deny the application, but said waivers provide an edge. “Several competitors have reportedly received exemptions from the RFS,” he said in a written statement to Reuters. “If true, any refinery which has not been exempted from the RFS will be at a competitive disadvantage.” Exxon spokesman Dan Carter declined to comment. It’s unclear whether the EPA has approved the Exxon or Chevron application. EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman declined to comment on which firms have applied for or received exemptions. She said the agency considers any application to exempt a refinery of less than 75,000 bpd - regardless of the size of the company that owns it. “EPA decisions on waivers are based on refinery-specific information,” she said in an email. “We continue to work through petitions received for 2017.” Exxon reported net profits of $19.7 billion last year. Chevron reported earning $9.2 billion. Both bill themselves as globally integrated companies, and neither breaks out the financial details for their individual facilities in the public disclosures they are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The EPA has historically doled out fewer than ten hardship exemptions per year to U.S. refineries, according to a former U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. A current EPA official, however, said the number reached 20 for 2016. The EPA has come under pressure for being stingy with the waivers in the past. A successful lawsuit last year by Sinclair Oil Corporation led a federal court to order EPA to expand its definition of “economic hardship” - opening the door for more facilities to be eligible. The Trump administration has also signaled a willingness to help refining companies reduce their biofuels compliance costs - which industry players say has encouraged a surge in recent applications. Trump hosted a series of meetings with advocates for the corn and oil industries at the White House since late last year aimed at reforming biofuels regulations in a way that cuts costs for refiners without reducing overall biofuels demand. The effort failed to yield a deal due to protests from corn industry representatives. Obtaining a waiver helps refiners in two ways: they no longer have to earn or purchase blending credits, called RINs, to prove compliance, and they can sell any RINs they have on hand into the open market. That can provide a company with a benefit ranging into the tens of millions of dollars. Other big oil companies including Phillips 66 also own refineries small enough to be eligible for a waiver, as does CVR Energy which is owned by billionaire investor and Trump ally Carl Icahn. Officials for those companies did not respond to requests for comment on whether they are seeking exemptions. Icahn’s efforts last year to overhaul the biofuels program - while acting as an adviser to Trump on regulatory issues - drew scrutiny from federal investigators after lawmakers said it raised ethical concerns. Biofuels proponents including U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has criticized the use of RFS exemptions as “demand destruction” for corn-based ethanol. Ethanol demand has been vital to farmers who are buffeted by low commodities prices and the threat of a global trade war.

2018-04-12,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices held steady on Thursday, remaining close to highs last reached in late 2014 on tensions over Syria and shrinking global oil inventories.  Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled at $72.02 a barrel, down 4 cents. U.S. WTI crude futures CLc1 were up 25 cents at $67.07. Prices for both climbed in post-settlement trading.  “We’re pretty much holding steady on yesterday’s gains ... and it does look like there’s further upside ahead,” said Walter Zimmerman, chief technical analyst at United-ICAP. “People are still nervous about what’s going to happen in Syria ... nothing was solved overnight.” Oil prices jumped on Wednesday to their highest level since late 2014 after Saudi Arabia said it intercepted missiles over Riyadh and U.S. President Donald Trump warned of military action in Syria, both of which raised concerns about possible supply disruptions.  Some fundamental signals also supported prices. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said the global oil stocks surplus was close to evaporating due to healthy demand and its own supply cuts. The group is producing oil below its targets, meaning the world needs to use stocks to meet rising demand. OPEC said in its monthly report oil stocks in the developed world fell by 17.4 million barrels in February to 2.854 billion barrels, around 43 million barrels above the latest five-year average. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo told Reuters in New Delhi the global oil glut had effectively shrunk by nine-tenths since the start of 2017. “We have seen an accelerated shrinkage of stocks in storage from unparalleled highs of about 400 million barrels to about 43 million above the five-year average,” Barkindo said. OPEC, Russia and several other non-OPEC producers began trimming supply in January 2017. Their pact runs until the end of the year and OPEC meets in June to decide on its next course of action. “There is growing confidence that the declaration of cooperation will be extended beyond 2018,” Barkindo told Reuters. “Russia will continue to play a leading role.” These bullish factors more than offset pressure from a U.S. government report showing crude oil inventories C-STK-T-EIA rose by 3.3 million barrels, while production C-OUT-T-EIA hit a record 10.53 million barrels per day (bpd). Still, analysts were waiting for further fundamental signals. “This all depends on whether demand will be as strong as it is projected to be,” said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition in Stamford.

2018-04-12,"OXFORD, England, April 12 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - An Indian street vendor taught Harish Hande his most important financial lesson and sent him on a mission to create affordable energy solutions that work for the poorest people in the world’s largest democracy. Too many innovations ask the poor for a relatively large sum upfront, for example for solar panels that they can ill afford, said Harish Hande, co-founder of Selco, which has pioneered the delivery of decentralised solar energy to the poor in India. “The street vendor told me: I can’t afford 300 rupees ($4.60) a month, but 10 rupees a day I can manage,” Hande told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Thursday after receiving the Skoll Award for Social Entrepreneurship. By providing the street vendor with solar lighting that he could afford - by paying a small amount every day - Selco helped sustain a micro-entrepreneur, he said. Some 240 million Indians have no access to power and millions more in the country of 1.2 billion live with spotty supplies of electricity from an unreliable power grid, according to the International Energy Agency. “The poorest spend a much higher proportion of their income on energy, because they can’t afford to buy solar-powered machines and lighting, so they keep using kerosene, which is expensive, dangerous and bad for the environment,” said Hande. Hande has been on a mission for more than 20 years to change that by working directly with people in villages, towns and cities to find out what technologies they need and how they can finance them. “A one-size-fits-all approach won’t work - if you’re a blacksmith your needs are different from a roti maker. But that is not well understood. So we ask people, ‘what exactly do you need in your home or to run your business?’” he said. Access to reliable energy is not just about providing electricity, he said. “It’s a catalyst for true democracy in India, for providing business opportunities. With reliable and affordable energy, everyone has the chance to run a business,” he said. Hande has turned the business into an umbrella of organisations, each tasked with addressing gaps in energy access through marketing, selling, installing and servicing products in homes, schools and health centres across India. Hande estimates Selco has reached 7.5 million people in India, and the model is being replicated in the Philippines and Tanzania. $1 = 65.2800 Indian rupees

OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo told Reuters in New Delhi the global oil glut has effectively shrunk by nine-tenths since the start of 2017. “We have seen an accelerated shrinkage of stocks in storage from unparalleled highs of about 400 million barrels to about 43 million above the five-year average,” Barkindo said. U.S. crude rose 0.45 percent to $67.12 per barrel and Brent was last at $72.10, up 0.06 percent on the day. Both are at levels not seen since 2014. The dollar index was on track to snap a four-day losing streak as it rose 0.2 percent, with the euro down 0.28 percent to $1.233. “It’s a reversal of the safe-haven trade that lifted the yen and the Swiss franc earlier in the week,” said Karl Schamotta, director of global product and market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto. The Japanese yen weakened 0.37 percent versus the greenback at 107.20 per dollar, while the dollar was up 0.46 percent against the Swiss franc. Sterling was last trading at $1.4228, up 0.37 percent on the day. Safe-haven gold fell from an 11-week high as the dollar edged higher and investors booked profits. Spot gold dropped 1.2 percent to $1,337.01 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 1.46 percent to $1,336.70 an ounce. Copper lost 1.86 percent to $6,821.00 a tonne.

The risk of clashes between Western powers and Russia in Syria over an alleged chemical attack eased somewhat as Trump reworded his Wednesday threat that missiles “will be coming” while taunting Russia for supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Trump wrote on Thursday that an attack on Syria “could be very soon or not so soon at all.” Investors turned their focus to corporate earnings as BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, reported quarterly profit above Wall Street estimates. Its shares were up 1.9 percent. Analysts expect quarterly profit for all S&P 500 companies to rise 18.4 percent from a year ago, the biggest gain in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Investors are looking for earnings to be the market’s savior and to help reduce some of this volatility that we’ve seen,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 328.7 points, or 1.36 percent, to 24,518.15, the S&P 500 gained 24.64 points, or 0.93 percent, to 2,666.83 and the Nasdaq Composite added 72.98 points, or 1.03 percent, to 7,142.01. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.67 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.43 percent. Emerging market stocks lost 0.05 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.34 percent lower, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.12 percent. The higher risk appetite as geopolitical tensions eased boosted U.S. Treasury yields as bond prices fell. The safe-haven Japanese yen also fell. “There is less immediate concern about military strikes or action in Syria,” said Jim Vogel, interest rates strategist at FTN Financial in Memphis. “It doesn’t move it to the back-burner, but it allows you to look around and trade other things and that gives room for rates to rise just a little bit from their sort of cramped or compressed levels,” he said. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last fell 11/32 in price to yield 2.8303 percent, from 2.79 percent late on Wednesday.

2018-04-12,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran urged France on Thursday not to be influenced by Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported. The statement came after the prince - who is also defence minister of Iran’s main regional rival - appeared to chide French President Emmanuel Macron this week for supporting the 2015 deal to lift most economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs to Tehran’s nuclear programme. “As one of the signatories of the deal, France should avoid being influenced by the adventurous Salman and avoid listening to Riyadh’s repetitive and false claims against the deal,” Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said. Macron, speaking at a joint press conference with the prince in Paris on Tuesday, said he thought Iran’s regional influence needed to be checked but did not think the nuclear deal should be ripped up. The prince responded: “I hope the president isn’t upset with me with what I am about to say, but we do not want to repeat the deal made in 1938 which resulted in the start of World War 2,” in an apparent reference to the Munich appeasement deal with Hitler.

2018-04-12,"NEW YORK, April 12 (Reuters) - Prices for jet fuel have strengthened relative to diesel and gasoline prices and should keep climbing on strong demand for air travel fueled by global economic growth, analysts said. Demand for jet fuel has increased over the last two years as the global economy has strengthened and airplane passenger traffic has risen, said Sandy Fielden, director of oil and products research at Morningstar Commodities in Austin, Texas. Production of jet fuel has already risen in recent years. U.S. refinery and blender net production of kerosene-type jet fuel reached a record 1.7 million barrels per day in 2017, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, up 7 percent from two years ago. Ultra-low sulfur diesel futures, used as a proxy for the jet and kerosene markets, reached $2.1431 a gallon on Jan. 26 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest since Feb. 27, 2015; it last settled at $2.0927. However, jet fuel bought in the cash market has outpaced other refined products in the last year. In New York Harbor, jet fuel for physical delivery JET-DIFF-NYH traded on Thursday at 1.50 cents per gallon above the futures contract, traders said. At this time one year ago, jet fuel was at 3.75 cents per gallon below futures. By comparison, ultra-low sulfur diesel traded in the cash market (ULSD) has lagged. ULSD traded at 0.50 cent per gallon above the futures contract on Thursday, traders said, compared with 0.50 cent per gallon below that benchmark a year ago. With demand likely to keep growing, Michael Dei-Michei, head of research at JBC Energy in Vienna, Austria, said jet fuel will more frequently outprice diesel and at times gasoline. Producing jet fuel that meets industry specifications is not straightforward, Dei-Michei said. Much of the kerosene that comes from simple crude distillation towers needs to be further fixed and hydrotreated, he said. Jet fuel accounts for about 10 percent of products yielded from refineries, according to EIA data. “The U.S. has at least some sort of advantage since shale crude mostly yields a decent quality kerosene that can more easily be brought up to jet spec,” he added in an email.

2018-04-12,"(Adds context, quotes) MOSCOW, April 12 (Reuters) - A Moscow court on Thursday rejected an appeal by former Russian economy minister Alexei Ulyukayev against his conviction for bribery and left his eight-year jail sentence unchanged. Ulyukayev was found guilty in December of soliciting a $2 million bribe from Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin in return for approving the sale of state-controlled oil company Bashneft to Rosneft, something he initially opposed. Ulyukayev, who denied wrongdoing, said he had been deliberately framed. “I am not guilty and I did not commit the crime I am accused of,” Ulyukayev said in his final words to the court. “There has been no lack of evidence of my innocence.” The appeal was rejected after Sechin, who had declined to attend the December trial despite being summoned four times, testified as a witness at a closed session of the hearing on Thursday. At the request of prosecutors, reporters were asked to leave the courtroom for Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, to give evidence. Sechin later told Rossiya 24 state television that he had testified that Ulyukayev had asked him for a bribe. “I am the main witness and this was a matter of honour for me,” Sechin said. “I felt my responsibility for the fight against corruption receiving an additional result.” Prosecutors said they sought a closed session to hear Sechin because he would be asked commercially sensitive matters in which confidential information could be divulged.

2018-04-12,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) Chairman and Chief Executive Darren Woods’s compensation package rose about 4 percent last year to $17.5 million, his first year running the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer. The pay increase came as Exxon’s profit more than doubled in 2017 thanks to rising crude oil prices CLc1LCOc1 and as the company launched or added to major expansions in Brazil, the United States and Guyana. Still, Woods has had to grapple with a string of operational mistakes made by his predecessor, former U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Exxon’s stock has fallen about 14 percent since Woods took office in January 2017. Woods’s 2017 compensation package included a 20 percent increase in his salary to $1.2 million and a 50 percent increase in his bonus to $1.8 million, among other items, Exxon said in a regulatory filing on Thursday. For 2018, Woods’s salary was boosted again to $1.4 million, though the company did not break out other compensation items for this year. Woods, for his 2017 compensation package ,received 10 percent fewer shares as part of a stock award program. The value of smaller perks - including personal use of the company jet - fell about 50 percent to $282,544. Exxon, like many peers, has its CEOs travel on company-owned aircraft, even for personal matters. Woods’s compensation in 2017 was 108 times larger than the median compensation of $161,562 for Exxon’s roughly 70,000 employees. Exxon shareholders will meet on May 30 in Dallas for a nonbinding vote on the executive pay package at the company’s annual meeting. Shareholders will also vote on a slate of 10 directors for Exxon’s board. Michael Boskin, a Stanford University professor, is not standing for re-election as he has reached the board’s retirement age of 72. Shareholders will also consider resolutions on requiring the company to have an independent chairman, the threshold required to hold an annual meeting, board diversity and lobbying.  There are no shareholder resolutions related to climate change for the 2018 meeting. Shareholders approved a non-binding proposal at last year’s meeting for Exxon to prepare a report on its response to climate change. That report was released in February, though some shareholders have said it does not provide enough detail.

2018-04-12,"BAKU (Reuters) - Supporters of Azerbaijan’s president forced election monitors to halt a news conference on Thursday where they were announcing they had found the election that gave Ilham Aliyev a fourth term undemocratic. Members of Aliyev’s New Azerbaijan Party and pro-government journalists banged on the table where observers from the Organisation for Cooperation and Security in Europe (OSCE) were trying to speak, and shouted that their report was biased. The news conference on the credibility of Aliyev’s landslide re-election was suspended and resumed later. The OSCE said Wednesday’s vote had taken place “within a restrictive political environment and under laws that curtail fundamental rights and freedoms, which are prerequisites for genuine democratic elections.” Viorel Riceard Badea, head of the delegation from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, said: “We have to consider that, in a political environment where democratic principles are compromised and the rule of law is not observed, fair and free elections are not possible.” Azerbaijan’s Foreign Ministry called the OSCE report “unfair and not objective,” adding that it had complained directly to the monitors. Aliyev’s foreign policy aide, Novruz Mamedov, said on Facebook: “Circulation of a report that has been prepared in advance ... is a disrespect to voters, people, their will and choice.”  Aliyev, 56, won with more than 86 percent of the vote at an election boycotted by opposition parties which accuse him of authoritarian rule and suppressing political dissent, something he denies. First elected in October 2003, two months before the death of his father, Heydar Aliyev, who ruled for 10 years, Ilham Aliyev was re-elected in 2008 and 2013 - all votes that international observers said fell short of democratic standards. Aliyev has cemented his position with two referendums, one in 2009 that scrapped a two-term presidential limit and another in 2016 that extended the presidential term to seven years from five. He appointed his wife Mehriban first vice president, the second most powerful post after the president, in 2017. Monitors reported “widespread disregard for mandatory procedures, a lack of transparency, and numerous serious irregularities, including ballot box stuffing,” in Wednesday’s election, adding: “in the absence of pluralism, including in the media, the election lacked genuine freedom.” Opposition parties called the vote a “show”. “We don’t recognise the election results and call for a transparent election,” Arif Gajily, head of the Musavat Party, told a news conference. Seven candidates ran, but critics questioned whether they were actual opponents. Two of them voted for Aliyev, news website Yenicag.az reported.  The election commission said it had received no complaints about irregularities. At the news conference, Aliyev’s supporters shouted: “Your report was prepared in advance to please Armenians”, referring to a long-standing conflict with neighbouring Armenia over Azerbaijan’s breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region. Aliyev has tried to strike a balance between Azerbaijan’s former Soviet master Russia and the West, notably on energy policy. He has benefited from a boom fuelled by oil exports, but a slump in global crude prices in the last three years has weakened the Azeri currency and shrunk the economy.

2018-04-12,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Comments by OPEC ministers: tmsnrt.rs/2GU0ZQL By John Kemp LONDON, April 12 (Reuters) - OPEC appears to be reformulating its target in terms of upstream investment rather than oil inventories, according to an analysis of recent statements made by ministers from member countries. “There is no such thing as a target price by Saudi Arabia,” the kingdom’s energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, told reporters on Wednesday (“Saudi Arabia happy with oil market, won’t let another glut form”, Reuters, April 11). “We’re seeing (production in) many regions declining. The only way to offset this is for the financial markets to start financing and funding upstream projects,” Falih observed. “I don’t know what is the price that will provide that equilibrium. All we know is in 2018 we’re still not seeing that.” Falih’s comments suggest the kingdom is now targeting a sustainable level of exploration and production – and prices will have to rise further to incentivise it. The new weight attached to sustainable investment echoes comments made by other ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in recent weeks. “We will know we have a good price when the market is balanced and we have enough investments. We need to have more investments coming”, the UAE energy minister said on April 11 (“UAE says producers trying to define structure for long-term alliance”, Reuters, April 11). “There has been a clear recovery in oil prices. But it has not been met with an increase in investments ... Investment has been very low,” Qatar’s energy minister said on April 5. “Investors are still cautious and over-conservative. We need to restore investments,” he added (“Qatar says too early to exit OPEC oil cuts as investment still low”, Reuters, April 5). The emphasis on investment stands in marked contrast to the previous focus on reducing oil inventories in the OECD industrialised countries to the five-year average. “Almost the single metric that we look at is global inventories and of course the most transparent and trustworthy is the OECD inventories,” Falih said as recently as December. The recent shift from inventories to investment is consistent across multiple ministers, which suggests it is the result of private discussions within OPEC (tmsnrt.rs/2GU0ZQL). Focusing on investment is not new for the organisation. The need for prices high enough to support sustainable investment in production has been acknowledged since OPEC was created. OPEC’s founding statute, approved in 1961, commits the organisation to stabilising prices, securing a steady income for producing countries, and ensuring a fair return on capital to investors in the petroleum industry. OPEC members have often stated the need for “security of demand” and for prices to be high enough to justify investment in new capacity. As a practical matter, the overriding target for OPEC members has always been to maximise government revenues from the sale of petroleum. But the organisation has rarely stated its objective so bluntly and has normally preferred to declare a less controversial intermediate or operational target such as tax rates, sustainable investment, inventories or price stability. In the early years, OPEC began by focusing on raising royalties and tax rates (1960s), then increasing prices and obtaining equity ownership of oil production (1970s). By the early 1980s, OPEC members had obtained complete ownership of production on their territories and the focus shifted more explicitly to revenue maximisation. Since that time, OPEC has alternated regularly between trying to raise prices and trying to protect its market share against rivals. In the most recent cycle, OPEC focused on maintaining prices above $100 per barrel between 2011 and the middle of 2014. From mid-2014 to mid-2016, OPEC switched to defending market share against competition from U.S. shale and other producers, and was prepared to allow prices to slump to protect its exports. Since the end of 2016, OPEC’s priority has reverted to raising prices and it has been willing to sacrifice some market share to attain that goal. FIVE-YEAR AVERAGE In the early stages of its current price-protection strategy, OPEC formulated its goal in terms of the need to reduce excess inventories that had built up during the slump. Higher prices were merely an incidental benefit of cutting stockpiles back towards the five-year average - at least in theory. In practice, higher prices and revenues have been the main benefit of the strategy, with benchmark Brent prices increasing from $46 to $72 since OPEC announced it would cut production. Inventories are now close to the five-year average, and have actually fallen below it in terms of forward cover, but OPEC members still appear to want to continue curbing output and raising prices. So the inventory target has been swapped for an investment objective to justify continued production restraint. Saudi officials remain coy about the kingdom’s target for oil prices and the energy minister has flatly denied there is one. But the kingdom’s comments and supply behaviour suggest it is reasonable to infer that it has an undeclared target of around $80 +/- $5 per barrel (“Saudi Arabia signals ambition for $80 oil price”, Bloomberg, April 10). Prices around $80 would balance the kingdom’s budget, help pay for the government’s ambitious reform programme, and make it easier to achieve a notional $2 trillion valuation when shares in state oil producer Saudi Aramco are sold. OPEC’s ambitions for prices have steadily increased from around $60 to $70 and now $80 over the last 18 months, based on comments made by ministers and other senior officials. The escalation in the organisation’s price target fits a familiar pattern in which the more prices rise, the more OPEC hopes they will increase further. For OPEC members, the sustainable equilibrium price is almost always at least $10 higher than the current price. But by chasing higher prices, the organisation risks increasing rival supplies from U.S. shale and other producers as well as slower growth in oil consumption. OPEC members have said they want to see more investment - but that implies higher output from U.S. shale as well as other non-OPEC sources. Before prices dropped in June 2014, the problem was too much investment, which had caused excessive supply growth and created the conditions for the slump. By pushing for higher prices, OPEC may be on the verge of making the same mistake again.

France is expected to join the United States and Britain in carrying out air strikes or some other form of attack in response to the use of the weapons but it remains unclear when that might happen or even if it definitely will. “We have proof that last week, now 10 days ago, that chemical weapons were used, at least with chlorine, and that they were used by the regime of (President) Bashar al-Assad,” Macron said, without giving details on the evidence or how it was acquired. The attack on the town of Douma on April 7 killed dozens of people, including children. “Our teams have been working on this all week and we will need to take decisions in due course, when we judge it most useful and effective,” Macron told broadcaster TF1 when asked whether a red line had been crossed. U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted on Thursday morning: “Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all!” Macron said France wanted to remove the Syrian regime’s chemical weapons capabilities. When asked whether those would be the targets of strikes he said: “When we decide it, and once we have verified all the information.” The French army is preparing itself for a possible riposte as it waits for the political green light, military sources told Reuters, with several sources underscoring the difficulty of outlining the objectives of such an operation. The sources said if France were to attack, the strikes would most likely come from warplanes rather than its naval frigate off the Lebanese coast, and that they would likely to take off from France rather than its Middle East bases. The subject of chemical weapons’ use in Syria has been a thorny issue for Macron. He has warned that he would not accept the use of chemical weapons, which he said was a “red line” that would draw French action, even unilateral. However, after persistent reports of chlorine attacks over the last year, his foreign minister and aides have been more nuanced saying a response would hinge on French intelligence proving both the use of chemicals and fatalities, and a riposte would most likely be in coordination with the United States. “France will not allow any escalation that could harm the stability of the region as a whole, but we can’t let regimes that think they can do everything they want, including the worst things that violate international law, to act,” Macron said.

2018-04-12,"LONDON/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The global oil stocks surplus is close to evaporating, OPEC said on Thursday, citing healthy energy demand and its own supply cuts while revising up its forecast for production from rivals who have benefited from higher oil prices. U.S. shale oil output has been booming over the past year since OPEC reduced its own production in tandem with Russia to prop up global oil prices. But as oil production collapsed in OPEC member Venezuela and is still facing hiccups in countries such as Libya and Angola, the oil exporters’ group is still producing below its targets meaning the world needs to use stocks to meet rising demand. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said in its monthly report oil stocks in the developed world reversed a rise in January to fall by 17.4 million barrels in February to 2.854 billion barrels, around 43 million barrels above the latest five-year average. “We have achieved an over 150 percent conformity level,” OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo told Reuters in New Delhi, referring to OPEC’s commitments under the supply-cutting pact. He said the glut has effectively shrunk by nine-tenths since the start of 2017. “We have seen an accelerated shrinkage of stocks in storage from unparalleled highs of about 400 million barrels to about 43 million above the five-year average,” Barkindo said. Stock levels are now 207 million barrels below their level in February 2017, with crude stocks in a surplus of 55 million barrels and product stocks in a deficit of 12 million. “Looking forward, a healthy global economic forecast for 2018, positive car sales data in recent months, stronger 2018 yea-on-year U.S. product consumption in January and potentially tighter global product markets are expected to boost gasoline and distillates demand ...,” OPEC said. “High conformity levels observed by OPEC and non-OPEC producing countries ... should further enhance market stability and support crude and product markets in the months ahead.” The 14-member, Vienna-based producer group said its collective output, according to secondary sources, fell 201,000 bpd to 31.96 million bpd in March from February, driven by declines in Angola, Algeria, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Libya.  The figure is below the 32.6 million bpd that OPEC sees as demand for its crude for the whole of 2018. OPEC, Russia and several other non-OPEC producers began to cut supply in January 2017. The pact runs until the end of the year and OPEC meets in Vienna in June to decide on its next course of action. OPEC’s leader Saudi Arabia has said it would like the pact to be extended into 2019. “There is growing confidence that the declaration of cooperation will be extended beyond 2018,” Barkindo told Reuters. “Russia will continue to play a leading role.” On Thursday, OPEC also revised its forecast for supply growth from its rivals, non-OPEC, which is now forecast to grow by a further 80,000 barrels per day this year to 1.71 million bpd, driven largely by higher-than-anticipated growth in the first quarter in the United States and the former Soviet Union. At the same time, it increased its forecast for global oil demand growth for this year by 30,000 bpd to 1.63 million bpd. “This mainly reflects the positive momentum in the OECD in the 1Q18 on the back of better-than-expected data, and supported by development in industrial activities, colder-than-anticipated weather and strong mining activities in the OECD Americas and the OECD Asia Pacific,” it said in the monthly market report. Production in the United Arab Emirates posted the largest month-on-month increase, according to the secondary sources, rising by around 45,000 bpd in March to 2.86 million bpd. OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia told the group it pumped 9.907 million bpd in March, 28,000 bpd below its February level. Venezuela reported production of 1.509 million bpd in March, 77,000 bpd below the level it reported in February.

2018-04-12,"(Updates with quotes) By Alex Lawler and Nidhi Verma NEW DELHI, April 12 (Reuters) - OPEC and its oil producer allies are poised to extend their supply-cutting pact into 2019 even as a global glut of crude is set to evaporate by September, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said on Thursday. In an interview with Reuters in New Delhi, Barkindo said the initial draft of a longer-term alliance agreement between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers would be discussed at their June meeting in Vienna. “There is growing confidence that the declaration of cooperation will be extended beyond 2018,” Barkindo told Reuters. “Russia will continue to play a leading role.” OPEC, Russia and several other non-OPEC producers began to cut supply in January 2017 in an effort to lift oil prices. The pact runs until the end of this year, and the June meeting will see the participants decide their next course of action. OPEC’s de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, has said it would like the pact - under which output is being reduced by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) - to be extended into 2019. The 14-member, Vienna-based OPEC said its collective output, according to secondary sources, fell by 201,000 bpd to 31.96 million bpd in March from February, driven by declines in Angola, Algeria, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Libya. The figure is below the 32.6 million bpd that OPEC sees as demand for its crude for the whole of 2018. “We have achieved an over 150 percent conformity level,” he said, referring to OPEC’s commitments under the supply-cutting pact. “We have seen an accelerated shrinkage of stocks in storage from unparalleled highs of about 400 million barrels to about 43 million above the five-year average,” Barkindo said. Lower production from OPEC has helped offset booming U.S. shale oil output and with global demand rising by more than 1.5 percent this year, consumers are having to drain stocks. Barkindo said he expected the global oil market to rebalance in the second to third quarters of 2018, earlier than a previous forecast of the year-end. OPEC said on Thursday that healthy economic growth, strong car sales and U.S. product consumption should help boost the global market for oil products in coming months.

The risk of clashes between Western powers and Russia in Syria over an alleged chemical attack kept bond yields low, while crude prices fell back, having surged to 2014 highs as a result of political risk in the oil-rich region. MSCI’s world equity index was down for the second day but European shares managed a 0.4 percent gain as risky assets regained the upper hand. Minutes from the European Central Bank’s March meeting changed little in European trading, with investors waiting for speeches from ECB members Coeure, Constancio and Weidmann later in the day. Sentiment in European stocks improved ahead of Wall Street’s open with futures up 0.6 percent. Investors’ expectations for very strong results from U.S. corporates in the quarterly earnings season kept them from turning overly bearish on stocks despite political risks. The world’s biggest asset manager, Blackrock, kicked off the earnings season with profit ahead of estimates. Trump on Thursday amended an earlier warning of a swift military strike on Syria, writing on Twitter “it could be very soon or not so soon at all”, sending the dollar higher. Trump had declared on Wednesday that missiles “will be coming” in Syria, taunting Russia for supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after the suspected chemical attack in Douma. Damascus and Moscow have denied any responsibility. His comments raised the prospect of direct conflict over Syria for the first time between the two world powers backing opposing sides in the seven-year-old civil war. Heightened geopolitical tensions have piled pressure on investors already rattled by a trade spat between the United States and China and a generally more volatile market. “We are seeing this regime shift take place in terms of drivers to volatility,” said Norman Villamin, chief investment officer of private banking at UBP in Zurich. Villamin expects the VIX gauge of S&P 500 volatility to stay around the 20 mark - roughly twice its average level last year. The VIX was last trading at its lowest level since April 6. “If your portfolio today looks like it did last year, then you probably haven’t done enough to adapt your exposure,” he said. Crude prices fell back after three sessions of strong gains took them to their highest levels since late 2014 on Wednesday. U.S. crude futures last traded down 0.7 percent at $66.35 a barrel, having risen 7.4 percent so far this week. They traded as high as $67.45 on Wednesday. Brent declined 0.8 percent to $71.53 a barrel, having touched a high of $73.09 on Wednesday. European government bond yields remained low as caution dominated ahead of ECB minutes and speeches from several ECB members. Germany’s 10-year Bund yield rose 1 basis point to 0.512, staying near the one-week low it hit on Wednesday. “Investors are really torn on bonds right now because they know the economy is strong and inflation is coming up,” said UBP’s Villamin. He started adding to government bonds last month for the first time since 2016, hoping to benefit from bonds’ relatively low volatility. Safe-haven gold slipped 0.6 percent from an 11-week high after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting on Wednesday raised expectations it could raise rates at a faster pace. Risk appetite also returned to currency markets The dollar index rose 0.3 percent to a session high after Trump’s latest comments, though it was still near a two-week low. The safe-haven yen edged lower to 107.09 against the dollar. The euro fell back 0.4 percent to $1.2329 ahead of the ECB meeting. Russia’s rouble edged up for a second day after heavy selling due to new punitive sanctions by the United States. It traded around 61.69 to the dollar, still down more than 7 percent this week. The Turkish lira, which has been highly sensitive to developments in neighbouring Syria, recovered slightly to trade at 4.1011 per dollar after hitting a record low of 4.1920 on Wednesday. The lira is down 2 percent so far this week, also hit by concern about inflation and the central bank’s reluctance to tighten its policy. Worries about the Middle East have overshadowed budding optimism that Washington and Beijing will work out a compromise to avert a trade war following a speech by Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday. “Underneath the sabre-rattling, there’s negotiations, so maybe that is a bit of a buying opportunity,” said Gill Lakin, chief investment officer at Brompton Asset Management. ***For Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets, type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window*** Reporting by Helen Reid

2018-04-12,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: LNG demand by region: reut.rs/2HgVgUd By Clyde Russell SINGAPORE, April 12 (Reuters) - Buyers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) have grown “fat and lazy” on expectations of a surplus of the super-chilled fuel and they now risk a shortage in the early years of the next decade. There’s no surprise that this was the view of a LNG project developer, expressed at this week’s LNG Asia Pacific Congress, hosted in Singapore by IBC. The perspective of buyers was somewhat different, with some recognising that prior forecasts of a large surplus were unlikely to materialise, given rising demand in several Asian countries that are new to the LNG market. But the common theme among those building import terminals and associated infrastructure was that LNG producers should participate in developing markets, otherwise the anticipated surge in demand may not occur. “They need to have skin in the game,” was how one developer of an import terminal put it. The conference was held under Chatham House rules, meaning information may be disseminated but cannot be attributed to individual participants. There are at least 14 LNG import terminals being planned or developed in South and Southeast Asia, the region that, along with China, provides the bulk of the optimism for LNG demand in the next decade. But the nature of these projects and the associated infrastructure may give some pause for thought to those who take the view that this is locked-in future demand that will eat up any LNG surplus. Pakistan has plans to build new import capacity of 9 million tonnes per annum, double its current capacity, but this will be developed largely by private operators. The market for new LNG in Pakistan is also dependent on associated infrastructure, such as building residential connections in new housing estates, and ensuring that power plants are built to replace inefficient and increasingly costly oil-fired generators. In India, additional LNG is mainly targeted at industrial and residential users, as well as the fertilizer industry, and again, installing the associated infrastructure to distribute the re-gasified LNG becomes the key. With governments across South and Southeast Asia finding it increasingly beyond their budgets to fund all the required infrastructure, it will fall to the private sector to stump up the money. Even China, which boosted LNG demand by 46 percent last year, will rely on smaller companies to boost demand in coming years, with most of the planned import capacity being developed by operators outside the state-owned majors. LNG importers want producers to help, and even develop retail brands, much as international oil companies built up distribution and retail networks for products such as gasoline and diesel. While there is interest among LNG producers and trading houses to help develop import facilities in emerging Asian buyers, the interest often stops at the terminal, and developing the actual end-user infrastructure is left to domestic operators. This raises the possibility of stranded assets being developed, whereby import facilities, mainly floating storage and re-gasification units (FSRUs) are built and deployed, but the ability to distribute the natural gas is lacking, even if the demand is present. On the other side of the coin, there is the emerging risk that LNG supply may be insufficient by the middle of the next decade, largely because buyers have been on strike. The doubling of LNG capacity in the period from 2015 to 2020, created by a wave of new projects mainly in Australia and the United States, led to a sea-change in buyer behaviour. No longer were Asia’s LNG consumers willing to enter into long-term, oil-linked and destination restricted contracts. Instead, they wanted short-term or even spot deals, with prices linked to natural gas benchmarks such as the U.S. Henry Hub. The long-term contracts that were a feature of the market helped underpin the financing needed to develop new capacity, and the shift in the market was understandably accompanied by a sharp drop in final investment decisions for new ventures. LNG buyers have for the past few years been comfortable with the then-prevailing view of a supply surplus, but now risk a rush for deals just like patrons at a pub jostle at the bar as last drinks are called. The most likely way to resolve the differences in perspective between buyers and sellers is for LNG producers to accept that they may have to partner more with their customers, while accepting shorter-term, flexible and smaller contracts. Buyers will have to realise that they no longer hold the whip hand, and will have to start committing to deals to boost supply in their own interests. And financiers, such as banks and development agencies, also have to adjust their thinking as the old world of a few major buyers committing to multi-year deals in order to underpin a new LNG plant is now gone. Instead, the new order is likely to be projects will sign up numerous customers to shorter deals for lower volumes.

2018-04-12,"MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Europe’s biggest utility Enel (ENEI.MI) is actively looking for mid-size acquisitions of mainly regulated assets outside Europe, with Latin America a focus, its chief executive told Reuters. “We’re looking at bolt-on deals below 5 billion euros ... several opportunities are coming to market in Brazil,” Francesco Starace said in an interview, adding they were mostly regulated grids. State-controlled Enel owns a majority stake in Spanish utility Endesa (ELE.MC) and is investing in green energy and grids to tackle the crisis in traditional power generation. Italy’s largest utility makes 47 percent of its core earnings from regulated network businesses, on which it plans to spend about one-third of its 14.6 billion euro growth budget. Last year it bought Brazilian power distribution company Celg-D for about $640 million. Starace, who confirmed an interest in Dutch energy company Eneco, valued at up to 4 billion euros, reiterated his opposition to large-size deals but said the group would look at assets in Europe that came to market from any break-up.  Utilities, long known for delivering reliable investment returns, are now breaking up, selling assets and eyeing mergers to cope with shrinking profitability. Starace said Enel had recently been offered German energy group Innogy (IGY.DE) but had turned it down because it did not see any clear growth potential. In March Germany’s RWE RWED.DE and E.ON EONGN.DE announced plans to break up Innogy in a major shakeup that flagged a new process of consolidation in the industry. “There is a growth story for Endesa as a result of a potential breakup of companies that have a less than sustainable status in the Iberian peninsula,” Starace said. Asked if Enel might sell Endesa to fund acquisitions, the CEO said there was no need since the company had financial headroom to fund any deal. Enel, which sees its ordinary core earnings at 18.2 billion euros in 2020, expects net debt to be 2.1 times EBITDA in 2020 from last year’s 2.4 times. “We are not going to sell down or buy up. We are going to keep it,” he said.  Funds have been eyeing Endesa’s stable revenue, generous dividend and relatively low debt ratios for some time, sources have said. “Every fall there’s a migration of birds, my birthday and funds that knock on my door to buy Endesa,” Starace said. When asked if the issue of sanctions in Russia was having any effect on the sale of Enel’s Reftinskaya coal power plant, the CEO said he was confident the deal would be agreed. The plant produces power for the Russian market, which means it is not subject to any embargo or sanctions, he said, adding the buyer would be Russian. “The sale is going to happen, it’s a question of a few months,” he said.

2018-04-12,"LONDON, April 12 (Reuters) - OPEC on Thursday revised its forecast for supply growth from its rivals for 2018 by nearly three times more than its revised projection of growth in global oil demand. It said growth in non-OPEC oil supply was forecast to rise by a further 80,000 barrels per day this year to 1.71 million bpd, driven largely by higher-than-anticipated growth in the first quarter in the United States and the former Soviet Union. At the same time, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its forecast for global oil demand growth for this year by 30,000 bpd to 1.63 million bpd. “This mainly reflects the positive momentum in the OECD in the 1Q18 on the back of better-than-expected data, and supported by development in industrial activities, colder-than-anticipated weather and strong mining activities in the OECD Americas and the OECD Asia Pacific,” it said in its monthly market report. The 14-member, Vienna-based producer group said its collective output according to secondary sources fell by 201,000 bpd to 31.96 million bpd in March from February, driven by declines in Angola, Algeria, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Libya. Production in the United Arab Emirates posted the largest month-on-month increase, according to the secondary sources, rising by around 45,000 bpd in March to 2.86 million bpd. OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia told the group it pumped 9.907 million bpd in March, 28,000 bpd below its February level. Venezuela reported production of 1.509 million bpd in March, 77,000 bpd below the level it reported in February. OPEC, Russia and several other non-OPEC producers began to cut supply in January 2017 in an effort to erase a global glut of crude that had built up since 2014. The pact runs until the end of the year and OPEC meets in Vienna in June to decide on its next course of action. Oil stocks in the developed world reversed a rise in January to fall by 17.4 million barrels in February to 2.854 billion barrels, around 43 million barrels above the latest five-year average, OPEC said. Stock levels are 207 million barrels below their level in February 2017. “Crude stocks indicated a surplus of 55 million barrels, while product stocks witnessed a deficit of 12 million barrels less than the seasonal norm,” the report said.

The ratcheting up of geopolitical tensions over an alleged chemical attack by Syrian government forces kept bond yields low, while crude prices eased back, having surged to 2014 highs as a result of political risk in the oil-rich region. MSCI’s world equity index fell for the second day, while European shares managed a 0.3 percent gain. Attention in Europe turned to the minutes of the March European Central Bank meeting expected at 1130 GMT. Investors hoped for greater clarity on the bank’s timing for the unwinding of quantitative easing. Losses among European stocks were limited by strong oil and gas shares, boosted by this week’s jump in crude prices, and sentiment also improved ahead of Wall Street’s open with futures up 0.4 to 0.5 percent. Investors were anticipating very strong results from U.S. corporates in the upcoming quarterly earnings season, keeping them from turning overly bearish on stocks despite political risks. U.S. President Trump amended on Thursday his earlier warning of a swift military strike on Syria, writing on Twitter “it could be very soon or not so soon at all”, sending the dollar higher. Trump had declared on Wednesday that missiles “will be coming” in Syria, taunting Russia for supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after the suspected chemical attack in Douma. Damascus and Moscow have denied any responsibility. His comments raised the prospect of direct conflict over Syria for the first time between the two world powers backing opposing sides in the seven-year-old civil war. Heightened geopolitical tensions have piled pressure on investors already rattled by a trade spat between the U.S. and China and a generally more volatile market environment. “We are seeing this regime shift take place in terms of drivers to volatility,” said Norman Villamin, chief investment officer of private banking at UBP in Zurich. Villamin expects the VIX gauge of S&P 500 volatility to stay around the 20 mark - roughly twice its average level last year. “If your portfolio today looks like it did last year, then you probably haven’t done enough to adapt your exposure,” he said. Crude prices eased back after three sessions of strong gains took them to their highest levels since late 2014 on Wednesday. U.S. crude futures last traded down 0.2 percent at $66.66 a barrel, having risen 7.4 percent so far this week. They traded as high as $67.45 on Wednesday. Brent declined 0.5 percent to $71.73 a barrel, having touched a high of $73.09 on Wednesday. European government bond yields remained low as caution dominated ahead of ECB minutes and speeches from several ECB members. Germany’s 10-year Bund yield rose 1 basis point to 0.512, staying near the one-week low it hit on Wednesday. “Investors are really torn on bonds right now because they know the economy is strong and inflation is coming up,” said UBP’s Villamin. He started adding to government bonds last month for the first time since 2016, hoping to benefit from bonds’ relatively low volatility. Safe-haven gold slipped 0.5 percent from an 11-week high after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting on Wednesday raised expectations the U.S. could raise rates at a faster pace. Currency markets settled as some strong risk-averse moves unwound. The dollar index rose 0.2 percent to a session high after Trump’s latest comments, though it was still near a two-week low. The safe-haven yen edged lower to 107.09 against the dollar. The euro meanwhile fell back 0.3 percent to $1.2329 ahead of the ECB meeting. Russia’s rouble edged up for a second day after heavy selling due to new punitive sanctions by the United States. It traded around 61.69 to the dollar, still down more than 7 percent this week. The Turkish lira, which has been highly sensitive to developments in neighbouring Syria, recovered slightly to trade at 4.1223 per dollar after hitting a record low of 4.1920 on Wednesday. The lira is down 2 percent so far this week, also hit by concern about inflation and the central bank’s reluctance to tighten its policy. Worries about the Middle East have overshadowed budding optimism that Washington and Beijing will work out a compromise to avert a trade war following Chinese President Xi Jinping’s speech on Tuesday. “Underneath the sabre-rattling, there’s negotiations, so maybe that is a bit of a buying opportunity,” said Gill Lakin, chief investment officer at Brompton Asset Management. ***For Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets, type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window*** Reporting by Helen Reid

2018-04-12,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Marcy Nicholson and Marcelo Teixeira NEW YORK/MEDICILÂNDIA, Brazil, April 12 (Reuters) - For years, Valdomiro Facchi has made a living ranching on land carved from the Amazon rainforest. He’s a small player in one of the world’s biggest environmental disasters. But now that his cattle have trampled the pastures to dust - and new laws prevent him from clearing fresh land - he has to find new income. “I want to diversify,” said the 68-year old rancher, outlining plans to plant cocoa trees on his 300 hectare plot in Brazil’s Para State. “I want to have the cocoa income when profit from cattle ranching fails.” Facchi illustrates a trend that is turning damaged parts of the Amazon basin green again and creating an usual alliance between the agriculture industry and conservationists. Brazil’s cattle ranchers are planting cocoa on their used-up pasture, with financial support from international environmental groups. That’s a big change. For decades, ranchers have been the engine of clear-cutting in the Amazon rainforest that has rendered an area nearly the size of Spain treeless. Environmentalists have argued the practice destroys wildlife habitat and undermines the planet’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide that causes global warming. “Besides being a means of avoiding deforestation, cocoa plantations favor the local, regional and national economy,” the international environmental group The Nature Conservancy said on its website. The young trees will also bring change to global cocoa markets. Brazil’s National Association of the Cocoa Processing Industry (AIPC) expects the surge in planting to help double the country’s output of the raw material in chocolate by 2028 to 400,000 tonnes a year. That increase would raise global output by about 5 percent. The renewed planting could make Brazil one of the world’s top three cocoa growers again after the sector was decimated in the 1990s by a crop fungus called witches’ broom. (For a graphic on global cocoa production and chocolate consumption, see: tmsnrt.rs/2GzYPF0 ) Conservationists and cocoa industry representatives expect the trend to help mitigate the effects of clear-cutting that has ripped some 430,000 square kilometers from the Amazon rain forest since the 1980s. Fifty percent of cocoa production growth will come from the Amazon, said Eduardo Bastos, executive director of the AIPC, calling the cocoa farms there “chocolate forests.” Green groups like The Nature Conservancy and the Amazon Fund have helped finance new cocoa plantations. The Amazon Fund - which was set up by Brazil’s government and takes international donations to combat deforestation - has poured 17 million reais ($5.09 million) in grants into the crop. Nearly 1,700 square kilometers of degraded cattle pasture in Brazil has been transformed into cocoa plantations already, according to the AIPC’s Bastos. Cocoa planting is driven mainly by new limits on the cattle industry that have changed the financial incentives for ranchers. In the Amazon, pasture can become degraded in as little as three years if not managed properly, making it hard to raise a thriving herd without new acreage. Brazil in 2014 passed a law that allows landowners to clear only 20 percent of their property in the Amazon and requires some landowners to replant depleted areas. That law aims to curb deforestation, which peaked in 2004 at a pace of 27,000 square km per year. In 2017, Brazilian Amazon lost 6,624 square km of rainforest. Compared to ranching, cocoa can provide income from a relatively small plot with no need for constant expansion. The profits can be up to five times better, said Eduardo Trevisan Gonçalves, project manager at Brazil’s Imaflora, an environmental group that did a study comparing income from cattle and cocoa in the region. The benefits extend to the environment. Cocoa plantations can imitate natural forests, helping to restore native plant and wildlife species, boosting water resources and absorbing carbon dioxide, Goncalves said. “It is a perennial crop,” he said. “It will stay there for decades.” Funding from environmental groups comes with guidelines intended to boost the ecological benefits of the plantations, according to José Garcia, a farmer in the central Pará state who is receiving a grant from the Amazon Fund. Under the terms, he said, he will have to plant cocoa alongside other taller native species, such as mahogany and ipê. “It is recommended that cocoa be planted with other trees - taller ones - to benefit from the shade,” he said at his farm in Medicilândia in Para State. Evidence of the shift is everywhere in the Medicilândia region, where barren pastures have given way to shady plantations of cocoa trees bearing yellow and ruby pods, the fibrous protective coverings for the cocoa beans. In the city of Medicilândia, a low-lying town lined with dirt roads in Para state, farmers truck bags full of dried cocoa beans to warehouses bearing signs that read “we buy cocoa.” Shops nearby offer ice-cold cocoa juice, a thick - sweet drink prepared with the fruit’s pulp. Brazil is an agricultural heavyweight, among the world’s top growers of soybeans, corn, sugar, coffee, and oranges. But it dropped from being No. 2 in cocoa in the early 1990s after witches’ broom slashed its production. In Para State, however, witches’ broom rarely survives long enough to damage trees. The fungus requires moist conditions and largely dies off during the annual dry season. As a result, cocoa tree yields in Para are nearly double the global average, said Bastos of the AIPC. There is some evidence Brazil could absorb some of this extra production: Euromonitor International pegs per capita chocolate consumption in Brazil at just 1.2 kilograms a year, compared with 8.8 kg in Switzerland, suggesting Brazil’s domestic chocolate market has room to grow. Brazil’s processing companies - which transform cocoa beans into butter, powder and chocolate - welcome the prospect of increased domestic supply to feed their factories and lower their imports, but inject a note of skepticism. Olam International’s Cocoa Vice President in Brazil, Kidambi Srinivasan, for example, called the 400,000 tonne per year target “an unlikely possibility” without higher market prices and more assistance to planters in areas including financing, training and supplies. Benchmark cocoa prices in New York are currently running at about $2,500 a tonne, having bounced off a 10-year low of $1,756 hit in 2017 on worries of global oversupply. Other big processors in Brazil include Cargill, which has an 85,000 tonne plant in Ilhéus, and Barry Callebaut, the world’s biggest maker of industrial chocolate, which opened its first South American chocolate facility in Brazil in 2010. For some of the ranchers-turned-planters, the chance to undo some of the damage to the Amazon caused by ranching is as important as the money they can earn from cocoa. “There was a time when I thought: We shouldn’t have come here,” said Elido Trevisan, who arrived in Para to ranch in 1972 and cleared nearly 100 percent of his land. “But now,” he said, “we can do something to compensate.” ($1 = 3.3372 reais) Reporting by Marcy Nicholson in New York and Marcelo Teixeira

2018-04-12,"(Adds CEO comment on automotive industry) By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen COPENHAGEN, April 12 (Reuters) - Danish pension fund PKA, with some $46 billion under asset management, said on Thursday it has excluded 35 oil and gas companies from its investment portfolio over failure to live up to the goals of the Paris climate agreement. PKA, which has previously excluded 70 coal companies and is an active investor into climate-friendly technology such as offshore wind power, said it would target carbon emissions in the automotive industry next. The move comes as big investors are scrutinizing their exposure to fossil fuels and stepping up pressure on the world’s biggest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to combat climate change. The excluded oil and gas companies include Anadarko, Chesapeake Energy, Marathon Oil, Apache, Gazprom, Inpex, Lukoil, Rosneft and Sinopec, PKA said. Chief Executive Peter Damgaard Jensen said PKA had reviewed 62 oil and gas companies to check if they had the “right managerial focus on the Paris agreement in their investments.” Of those, 15 will be added to an observation list with the aim to push them in a more climate-friendly direction, while 12 companies will remain in PKA’s portfolio. PKA, which oversees the retirement income of 300,000 Danish workers, said it would also put pressure on the automotive industry which it said accounts for about 16 percent of global CO2 emissions. “Automakers that don’t invest in the development of electric and hybrid cars will pose a financial risk, as electric cars will be more attractive to consumers in line with technological developments,” said Jensen. “At PKA, we will have the same critical approach to the automotive industry, as we have to coal and oil,” he said. The International Energy Agency estimates that 600 million cars need to be converted to electric or hybrid by 2040 to meet targets under the Paris agreement. $1 = 6.0201 Danish crowns

2018-04-12,"LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell said on Thursday it saw little risk of having “stranded assets” in its portfolio as the world shifts to low carbon energy because the oil major will have four-fifths of its current oil and gas reserves extracted before 2030 anyway. Shell (RDSa.L) has one of the lowest reserves life ratio among its peers and last year it saw reserves plunging to new lows after divesting a large number of assets. The major now sits on 12.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, down from 13.2 billion at the end of 2016, and enough to sustain the current annual production of 1.383 billion barrels for less than nine years. Reserves life has long been one of the key metrics monitored by investors to assess oil firms’ future resilience. Long reserve life was especially important during years when oil was seen as a finite asset and analysts predominantly believed in the theory of “peak oil”, suggesting the world will soon run out of good oil reserves. But as the United States, the world’s largest oil consumer, discovered at the start of this decade it had abundant reserves of shale oil and as demand patterns also began to shift toward greener energy, the “peak oil” theory faded. Instead it was replaced by a “peak demand” theory suggesting oil consumption will plateau and start declining soon due to electric vehicles, while large quantities of oil will not be produced and remain stranded under the ground. In such circumstances, having a short reserve life arguably makes more strategic sense as it allows companies to adjust faster to quickly changing consumption patterns. Shell said its assessments indicated “a low risk of stranded assets in the current portfolio”. “As of 31 December 2017, Shell estimates that around 80 percent of its current proved oil and gas reserves will be produced by 2030, and only 20 percent after that time,” it said. It said it was confident it would thrive through potential changes in the energy system to 2030 while growing new businesses to reduce costs and improve emissions. “The company is expanding in the power market ... This includes investments in areas such as wind generation in the Netherlands, supplying power to retail customers in the UK and offering hydrogen refuelling and electric-car charging.” “Longer term there is great uncertainty in how the energy transition will unfold, but Shell believes its strategic flexibility will allow it to adapt in step with society.” Out of Shell’s total proved reserves of 12.2 billion barrels, oil constitutes 4.6 billion, synthetic Canadian crude another 0.65 billion barrels while the rest is natural gas. Shell has previously announced ambition to reduce net carbon footprint of the energy products it sells by around half by 2050.  The plan is fairly unique for the industry as it covers not only emissions from the production of energy products, but also those from the consumption of Shell’s products by its customers.

2018-04-12,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull acknowledged on Thursday that legislation aimed at preventing foreign interference in politics had soured ties with China, putting a biennial Australia-China trade fair in jeopardy. Relations between Australia and its largest trading partner have been strained over the past year, partly over Australian concern about rising Chinese influence, which led to the introduction of legislation banning foreign political donations. The Australian Financial Review, citing unidentified sources, said this week China had denied visas to Australian government officials to attend a major trade show, denting close economic ties between the two countries.      “There’s clearly been some tension in the relationship following the introduction of our legislation about foreign interference but I’m very confident that any misunderstandings will be resolved,” Turnbull told 3AW Radio in Melbourne. “I wouldn’t say they’ve been declined,” Turnbull said of the visa applications, without elaborating. The foreign ministry did not respond to emailed requests for comment. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said reports of visa denials were “unfounded”.  “The situation does not exist,” he told a regular news briefing.  Australian Trade Minister Steven Ciobo told Reuters discussions about rescheduling the event were under way. However, two sources with knowledge of the planning for the Australia Week trade event said it was unlikely the gathering, already pushed back from May to July, would go ahead at this late stage. “There’s no way of knowing that things would change sufficiently for (Australia) Week to go ahead,” one of the sources, who requested anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the media, told Reuters. “It’s just not going to happen,” said the second source.  Last month, Frances Adamson, Australia’s most senior civil servant at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, said she was still trying to arrange an annual visit to China, some five months after Beijing said it was unable to accommodate her due to scheduling conflicts. Late last year, Turnbull referred to “disturbing reports about Chinese influence” and warned of foreign powers’ “unprecedented and increasingly sophisticated attempts to influence the political process”. The Australian legislation, which is expected to be passed soon, also requires the registration of lobbyists working for foreign countries. China has previously expressed its displeasure at foreign governments through a range of responses. Last year, South Korean companies were effectively blocked from operating in China after Seoul agreed to install a U.S. anti-missile system that Beijing strongly objected to. In 2016, nine Singaporean armoured vehicles were seized in Hong Kong on their way home from military exercises in Taiwan, which China considers a wayward province. The latest spat has weighed on Australia-China relations, which are now arguably at an even lower point than 2009, when Rio Tinto executive Stern Hu was on trial, and subsequently jailed, in Shanghai on bribery and industrial espionage charges and when then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd gave an inflammatory speech in Beijing about human rights. China bought A$93 billion ($70 billion) worth of Australian goods and services last year, but trade ties are only one side of a delicate balancing act for Australia, whose security relationship with the United States has limited how close it gets with China. Turnbull’s comments also come just a few days after he warned China against developing a military presence on the tiny Pacific Island of Vanuatu after reports by Australia’s Fairfax media. Encouraged by the United States, Australia has sharpened its criticism of China’s activities in the Pacific and the South China Sea. Australian International Development Minister Concetta Fierravanti-Wells in January accused China of funding “roads to nowhere” and “useless buildings” in the Pacific, amid fears Canberra’s historical dominance in the region was eroding.

2018-04-12,"* World stocks fall 0.2 percent * Crude and gold prices ease from highs * European investors await ECB meeting * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Graphic: Middle East tensions send crude prices up By Helen Reid LONDON, April 12 (Reuters) - World stocks edged down further on Thursday as anxious investors stayed wary of risky assets, seeking protection against a threatened clash between Western powers and Russia in Syria. The ratcheting up of geopolitical tensions over an alleged chemical attack by Syrian government forces weighed on equities and kept bond yields low, while oil prices eased back slightly, having surged to 2014 highs as a result of the tensions in the Middle East. MSCI’s world equity index fell for the second day, while European shares declined 0.1 percent in early deals. Aside from the political developments, European investors also awaited a European Central Bank meeting later in the day, hoping for greater clarity on the bank’s timing for the unwinding of quantitative easing. Losses were limited by strong oil and gas stocks, boosted by this week’s jump in crude prices. U.S. President Trump declared that missiles “will be coming” in Syria, taunting Russia for supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after the suspected chemical attack in Douma. Damascus and Moscow have denied any responsibility. His comments raised the prospect of direct conflict over Syria for the first time between the two world powers backing opposing sides in the seven-year-old civil war. Heightened geopolitical tensions have piled pressure on investors already rattled by a trade spat between the U.S. and China and a generally more volatile market environment. “We are seeing this regime shift take place in terms of drivers to volatility,” said Norman Villamin, chief investment officer of private banking at UBP in Zurich. Villamin expects the VIX gauge of S&P 500 volatility to stay around the 20 mark - roughly twice its average level last year. “If your portfolio today looks like it did last year, then you probably haven’t done enough to adapt your exposure,” he said. Crude prices eased back slightly after three sessions of strong gains took them to the highest levels since late 2014. U.S. crude futures last traded down 0.3 percent at $66.66 a barrel, having risen 7.4 percent so far this week. They traded as high as $67.45 on Wednesday. Brent declined 0.4 percent to $71.77 a barrel, having touched a high of $73.09 on Wednesday. European government bond yields remained low as caution dominated ahead of the ECB meeting. Germany’s 10-year Bund yield slipped to 0.493 in early trades. “Investors are really torn on bonds right now because they know the economy is strong and inflation is coming up,” said Villamin. He started adding to government bonds last month for the first time since 2016, hoping to benefit from bonds’ relatively low volatility. Safe-haven gold edged down slightly after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting on Wednesday raised expectations the U.S. could raise rates at a faster pace. Gold eased 0.3 percent to trade at $1,348.75 per ounce, having hit an 11-week high at $1,365.30 on Wednesday. Currency markets drifted after some strong risk-averse moves. The dollar index inched higher, though it was still 0.5 percent down on the week. The safe-haven yen edged lower, having been bid up strongly on Wednesday. The euro was little moved, at $1.2369 ahead of the ECB meeting. Russia’s rouble edged up for a second day after heavy selling due to new punitive sanctions by the United States. It traded around 62.29 to the dollar, still down more than 7 percent this week. The Turkish lira, which has been highly sensitive to developments in neighbouring Syria, traded at 4.1345 per dollar after hitting a record low of 4.1920 on Wednesday. The lira is down 2.5 percent so far this week, also hit by concern about inflation and the central bank’s reluctance to tighten its policy. Concerns on the Middle East have overshadowed budding optimism that Washington and Beijing will work out a compromise to avert a trade war following Chinese President Xi Jinping’s speech on Tuesday. “Underneath the sabre-rattling, there’s negotiations, so maybe that is a bit of a buying opportunity,” said Gill Lakin, chief investment officer at Brompton Asset Management. ***For Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets, type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window*** Reporting by Helen Reid; editing by Andrew Roche",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-markets/global-markets-simmering-middle-east-tensions-keep-stocks-under-pressure-idUKL8N1RP201,12 Apr 2018,"World stocks edged down further

2018-04-12,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand will not grant any new permits for offshore oil and gas exploration, Prime Minister Jacinda Ahern said on Thursday, taking the industry by surprise with a decision that it says will push investment overseas. The center-left Labour-led government said the move would not affect the country’s 22 existing exploration permits, and any oil and gas discoveries from firms holding those licenses could still lead to mining permits of up to 40 years. Ardern, who campaigned heavily on preventing climate change in the run-up to last year’s tight election, said the decision was a responsible step and provided certainty for businesses and communities. “We have been a world leader on critical issues to humanity by being nuclear free...and now we could be world leading in becoming carbon neutral,” she told university students in the country’s capital, Wellington. Interest in oil exploration in New Zealand has waned in recent years due to lower global oil prices, with only one permit issued in 2017, compared with 10 in 2014. However, business and regional leaders said they had been blindsided by the move and feared the government was risking jobs in the NZ$2.5 billion ($1.8 billion) oil and gas industry. National opposition Energy and Resources spokesman Jonathan Young said the decision would simply shift production elsewhere in the world, while Neil Holdom, mayor of the main city in the energy-rich Taranaki region, labeled it “a kick in the guts.” One of the country’s main energy companies, New Zealand Oil & Gas said it had not been warned of the change. “We note that the announcement is a sudden change of policy, which has not been consulted on and appears to conflict with the government’s pre-election promises,” it said in a statement.  The company, whose shares fell to six-month low, said the move would have no immediate material impact on its financial position, but it would invest in exploration and production assets in other jurisdictions. The oil and gas industry accounts for only about 1.4 percent of New Zealand’s economy, but the furor underscored the challenge faced by Labour - which has a support arrangement with the Green Party - in winning over the business sector. Business sentiment has plummeted to multi-year lows since Labour took office, ending almost a decade of conservative National rule, despite companies reporting robust demand for their services. While permits for searching for onshore oil and gas reserves will continue and existing offshore permits would not be touched, Ardern said the decision was about “setting our expectations for the future.” Reporting by Charlotte Greenfield, editing by Richard Pullin",https://uk.reuters.com/article/newzealand-oil-exploration/update-2-new-zealand-halts-future-oil-and-gas-offshore-exploration-permits-idUKL3N1RO6FU,12 Apr 2018,"* Industry not warned of policy - company

European shares are expected to be flat to lower, with futures for Germany’s Dax , France’s Cac and Britain’s FTSE  all trading slightly lower. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.4 percent while Japan’s Nikkei edged down 0.1 percent. On Wednesday, the S&P 500 lost 0.55 percent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.36 percent while energy shares gained more than 1 percent on rising oil prices. Trump declared that missiles “will be coming” in Syria, taunting Russia for supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after a suspected chemical attack on rebels. Damascus and Moscow have denied any responsibility. His comments raised the prospect of direct conflict over Syria for the first time between the two world powers backing opposing sides in the seven-year-old civil war, which has also escalated a rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran. “Last year Russia and Syria did not shoot back against U.S. missiles. But this time the scale of possible attacks by the U.S. and possibly its allies seems larger. If Russia fires back, the war front will be bigger,” said Hidenori Suezawa, financial market analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities. “I don’t think we are heading into the World War Three but should there be a direct collision between the U.S. and Russia for the first time, that’s the sort of headline that would plunge stock prices,” he added. The tension intensified in another front as Saudi Arabia said its air defence forces intercepted three ballistic missiles fired at Riyadh and other cities by Yemen’s Houthis. Trump has also threatened to withdraw from a nuclear deal struck in 2015 with Tehran. Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities, said Trump’s perceived brinkmanship on many issues from Syria to tariffs on imports from major trading partners ahead of mid-term elections make it hard for markets to focus on economic fundamentals. “It’s as if Trump is doing chicken games against China, chicken games against companies and chicken games against markets... Even if economic fundamentals are strong, it will be difficult to focus just on them,” said Kuramochi. Fears of more confrontations in the Middle East have boosted oil prices as well as safe-haven assets such as gold. Both U.S. crude and global benchmark Brent traded at the highest levels since 2014 as geopolitical concerns overshadowed a surprise buildup in U.S. crude inventories. U.S. crude futures traded at $67.10 a barrel, having risen 8.1 percent so far this week. They have traded as high as $67.45 on Wednesday, a level last seen in December 2014. Brent traded at $72.26 a barrel, having touched a high of $73.09 on Wednesday. Gold stood at $1,353.10 per ounce, having climbed to $1,365.30 on Wednesday. A break above its Jan. 25 high of $1,365.8 would take the yellow metal to a high last seen in August 2016. In the currency markets, the yen was helped by the risk averse mood. The dollar eased to 106.82 yen, having lost momentum after hitting a five-week high of 107.49 a week ago. The euro traded at $1.2370, having risen for a fourth day in a row on Wednesday. Still, the currency has mostly been in a holding pattern since late January. The Russian rouble steadied on Wednesday after two days of heavy selling due to worries about the Syrian conflict and new punitive sanctions by the United States. It closed around 62.59 to the dollar, still down more than 7 percent so far this week. The Turkish lira traded at 4.1550 per dollar after hitting a record low of 4.1944 on Wednesday. The lira is down more than two percent this week, also hit by concern about inflation and the central bank’s reluctant to tighten its policy. Worries on the Middle East overwhelmed budding optimism that Washington and Beijing will work out a compromise to avert a trade war following Chinese President Xi Jinping’s speech on Tuesday. Given the uncertainties on diplomacy and trade, economic news is currently of secondary importance to investors. Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting on March 20-21 released on Wednesday showed all of its policymakers felt that the U.S. economy would firm further and that inflation would rise in the coming months. U.S. consumer inflation figures matched economists’ forecasts. Prices fell for the first time in 10 months from the previous month in March, but the core CPI rose 2.1 percent year-on-year, the largest advance since February 2017, as the drag from last year’s plunge in prices for cellphone service plans dropped out of the calculation.

2018-04-12,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: LNG demand by region: reut.rs/2HgVgUd By Clyde Russell SINGAPORE, April 12 (Reuters) - Buyers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) have grown “fat and lazy” on expectations of a surplus of the super-chilled fuel and they now risk a shortage in the early years of the next decade. There’s no surprise that this was the view of a LNG project developer, expressed at this week’s LNG Asia Pacific Congress, hosted in Singapore by IBC. The perspective of buyers was somewhat different, with some recognising that prior forecasts of a large surplus were unlikely to materialise, given rising demand in several Asian countries that are new to the LNG market. But the common theme among those building import terminals and associated infrastructure was that LNG producers should participate in developing markets, otherwise the anticipated surge in demand may not occur. “They need to have skin in the game,” was how one developer of an import terminal put it. The conference was held under Chatham House rules, meaning information may be disseminated but cannot be attributed to individual participants. There are at least 14 LNG import terminals being planned or developed in South and Southeast Asia, the region that, along with China, provides the bulk of the optimism for LNG demand in the next decade. But the nature of these projects and the associated infrastructure may give some pause for thought to those who take the view that this is locked-in future demand that will eat up any LNG surplus. Pakistan has plans to build new import capacity of 9 million tonnes per annum, double its current capacity, but this will be developed largely by private operators. The market for new LNG in Pakistan is also dependent on associated infrastructure, such as building residential connections in new housing estates, and ensuring that power plants are built to replace inefficient and increasingly costly oil-fired generators. In India, additional LNG is mainly targeted at industrial and residential users, as well as the fertilizer industry, and again, installing the associated infrastructure to distribute the re-gasified LNG becomes the key. With governments across South and Southeast Asia finding it increasingly beyond their budgets to fund all the required infrastructure, it will fall to the private sector to stump up the money. Even China, which boosted LNG demand by 46 percent last year, will rely on smaller companies to boost demand in coming years, with most of the planned import capacity being developed by operators outside the state-owned majors. LNG importers want producers to help, and even develop retail brands, much as international oil companies built up distribution and retail networks for products such as gasoline and diesel. While there is interest among LNG producers and trading houses to help develop import facilities in emerging Asian buyers, the interest often stops at the terminal, and developing the actual end-user infrastructure is left to domestic operators. This raises the possibility of stranded assets being developed, whereby import facilities, mainly floating storage and re-gasification units (FSRUs) are built and deployed, but the ability to distribute the natural gas is lacking, even if the demand is present. On the other side of the coin, there is the emerging risk that LNG supply may be insufficient by the middle of the next decade, largely because buyers have been on strike. The doubling of LNG capacity in the period from 2015 to 2020, created by a wave of new projects mainly in Australia and the United States, led to a sea-change in buyer behaviour. No longer were Asia’s LNG consumers willing to enter into long-term, oil-linked and destination restricted contracts. Instead, they wanted short-term or even spot deals, with prices linked to natural gas benchmarks such as the U.S. Henry Hub. The long-term contracts that were a feature of the market helped underpin the financing needed to develop new capacity, and the shift in the market was understandably accompanied by a sharp drop in final investment decisions for new ventures. LNG buyers have for the past few years been comfortable with the then-prevailing view of a supply surplus, but now risk a rush for deals just like patrons at a pub jostle at the bar as last drinks are called. The most likely way to resolve the differences in perspective between buyers and sellers is for LNG producers to accept that they may have to partner more with their customers, while accepting shorter-term, flexible and smaller contracts. Buyers will have to realise that they no longer hold the whip hand, and will have to start committing to deals to boost supply in their own interests. And financiers, such as banks and development agencies, also have to adjust their thinking as the old world of a few major buyers committing to multi-year deals in order to underpin a new LNG plant is now gone. Instead, the new order is likely to be projects will sign up numerous customers to shorter deals for lower volumes.

2018-04-12,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The United States needs to invest $150 billion (£105.8 billion) in infrastructure to support growing natural gas production, with some producers facing shutdowns as they try to ramp up output, Tellurian Senior Vice President Amos Hochstein said on Thursday.  When oil prices rise, shale oil producers ramp up output and produce more associated gas, and there is not enough pipeline capacity to carry the gas to demand areas or for exports, Hochstein said, speaking at the International Energy Forum. West Texas Intermediate futures have been on a gradual rising trend over the last two years, from lows hit in early 2016, and are now holding above $65 per barrel. That has lifted the whole U.S. energy complex. [O/R]  “We need well over $150 billion worth of investment in infrastructure in the United States to support the gas production that is coming online,” Hochstein said.  Shale oil producers, including those in the Permian Basin, “are reaching a point where they have to make a decision whether to restrain their production in oil because they don’t have the ability to evacuate their gas,” he said.  The problem is that the U.S. infrastructure was historically not built to handle shale oil and shale gas, which producers are able to ramp up quickly when prices rise, he said.  There has also been too little investment into liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals, he said, which would provide an outlet for surplus gas.

2018-04-12,"* To find new coal-fired power plant locations end-2018 * Increase coal’s share in power generation to ensure security * Electricity from renewable to be priced at grid parity By Florence Tan and Chayut Setboonsarng NEW DELHI/BANGKOK, April 12 (Reuters) - Thailand is expected to increase the share of electricity generated by coal to diversify its fuel mix for power generation, the country’s energy minister said. “The share of coal in our power generation mix is very low at slightly less than 20 percent,” Energy Minister Siri Jirapongphan said on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum late on Wednesday. “We need to diversify the sources of fuel for our power generation. Having a reasonable percentage of coal to be used for power generation would be a necessity in considering the security of fuel supply to our generation system.” Thailand relies mainly on natural gas to generate power, but domestic demand is falling behind consumption, requiring the country to import more piped gas from Myanmar and more liquefied natural gas (LNG). A plan by the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) to build coal-fired power plants in the southern Thailand tourist destinations of Krabi and Songkhla has been delayed for years due to opposition from villagers and environmentalists. “We need to conduct a more global strategic environmental assessment to identify a more suitable location to build a coal-fired power plant that Thailand needs,” Siri said, adding that a decision on the plants’ locations could be made towards the end of this year. “In terms of contribution to carbon dioxide generation, Thailand can be considered as one of the lowest in the world,” Siri said. Thailand has promoted the use of renewable energy aggressively over the past 10 years, he said, adding that the share of electricity generation from renewables has reached around 12 percent, which is the highest rate among the countries that make up the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. “But that achievement came at an expense as we’re paying a high rate for generation of electricity from renewable resources,” he said. Authorities increased retail electricity prices by 3.5 percent last year for the first time since 2014, citing rising oil and gas prices. Falling costs for solar panels has made the renewable resource competitive against fossil fuels. “We have proven in several pilot projects that we can expand on our success to promote more electricity generation from renewable resources at a price which we call grid parity at 8 cents (per kilowatt hour) on a wholesale basis.” Going forward, Siri said Thailand will only be accepting grid-parity prices of electricity generated from renewable sources.

2018-04-12,"NEW YORK/MEDICILÂNDIA, Brazil (Reuters) - For years, Valdomiro Facchi has made a living ranching on land carved from the Amazon rainforest. He’s a small player in one of the world’s biggest environmental disasters. But now that his cattle have trampled the pastures to dust - and new laws prevent him from clearing fresh land - he has to find new income. “I want to diversify,” said the 68-year old rancher, outlining plans to plant cocoa trees on his 300 hectare plot in Brazil’s Para State. “I want to have the cocoa income when profit from cattle ranching fails.” Facchi illustrates a trend that is turning damaged parts of the Amazon basin green again and creating an usual alliance between the agriculture industry and conservationists. Brazil’s cattle ranchers are planting cocoa on their used-up pasture, with financial support from international environmental groups. That’s a big change. For decades, ranchers have been the engine of clear-cutting in the Amazon rainforest that has rendered an area nearly the size of Spain treeless. Environmentalists have argued the practice destroys wildlife habitat and undermines the planet’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide that causes global warming. “Besides being a means of avoiding deforestation, cocoa plantations favor the local, regional and national economy,” the international environmental group The Nature Conservancy said on its website. The young trees will also bring change to global cocoa markets. Brazil’s National Association of the Cocoa Processing Industry (AIPC) expects the surge in planting to help double the country’s output of the raw material in chocolate by 2028 to 400,000 tonnes a year. That increase would raise global output by about 5 percent.  The renewed planting could make Brazil one of the world’s top three cocoa growers again after the sector was decimated in the 1990s by a crop fungus called witches’ broom. (For a graphic on global cocoa production and chocolate consumption, see: tmsnrt.rs/2GzYPF0 ) Conservationists and cocoa industry representatives expect the trend to help mitigate the effects of clear-cutting that has ripped some 430,000 square kilometers from the Amazon rain forest since the 1980s. Fifty percent of cocoa production growth will come from the Amazon, said Eduardo Bastos, executive director of the AIPC, calling the cocoa farms there “chocolate forests.” Green groups like The Nature Conservancy and the Amazon Fund have helped finance new cocoa plantations. The Amazon Fund - which was set up by Brazil’s government and takes international donations to combat deforestation - has poured 17 million reais ($5.09 million) in grants into the crop. Nearly 1,700 square kilometers of degraded cattle pasture in Brazil has been transformed into cocoa plantations already, according to the AIPC’s Bastos. Cocoa planting is driven mainly by new limits on the cattle industry that have changed the financial incentives for ranchers. In the Amazon, pasture can become degraded in as little as three years if not managed properly, making it hard to raise a thriving herd without new acreage. Brazil in 2014 passed a law that allows landowners to clear only 20 percent of their property in the Amazon and requires some landowners to replant depleted areas. That law aims to curb deforestation, which peaked in 2004 at a pace of 27,000 square km per year. In 2017, Brazilian Amazon lost 6,624 square km of rainforest. Compared to ranching, cocoa can provide income from a relatively small plot with no need for constant expansion. The profits can be up to five times better, said Eduardo Trevisan Gonçalves, project manager at Brazil’s Imaflora, an environmental group that did a study comparing income from cattle and cocoa in the region. The benefits extend to the environment. Cocoa plantations can imitate natural forests, helping to restore native plant and wildlife species, boosting water resources and absorbing carbon dioxide, Goncalves said. “It is a perennial crop,” he said. “It will stay there for decades.” Funding from environmental groups comes with guidelines intended to boost the ecological benefits of the plantations, according to José Garcia, a farmer in the central Pará state who is receiving a grant from the Amazon Fund.  Under the terms, he said, he will have to plant cocoa alongside other taller native species, such as mahogany and ipê.  “It is recommended that cocoa be planted with other trees - taller ones - to benefit from the shade,” he said at his farm in Medicilândia in Para State. Evidence of the shift is everywhere in the Medicilândia region, where barren pastures have given way to shady plantations of cocoa trees bearing yellow and ruby pods, the fibrous protective coverings for the cocoa beans. In the city of Medicilândia, a low-lying town lined with dirt roads in Para state, farmers truck bags full of dried cocoa beans to warehouses bearing signs that read “we buy cocoa.”  Shops nearby offer ice-cold cocoa juice, a thick - sweet drink prepared with the fruit’s pulp. Brazil is an agricultural heavyweight, among the world’s top growers of soybeans, corn, sugar, coffee, and oranges. But it dropped from being No. 2 in cocoa in the early 1990s after witches’ broom slashed its production. In Para State, however, witches’ broom rarely survives long enough to damage trees. The fungus requires moist conditions and largely dies off during the annual dry season. As a result, cocoa tree yields in Para are nearly double the global average, said Bastos of the AIPC. There is some evidence Brazil could absorb some of this extra production: Euromonitor International pegs per capita chocolate consumption in Brazil at just 1.2 kilograms a year, compared with 8.8 kg in Switzerland, suggesting Brazil’s domestic chocolate market has room to grow. Brazil’s processing companies - which transform cocoa beans into butter, powder and chocolate - welcome the prospect of increased domestic supply to feed their factories and lower their imports, but inject a note of skepticism.  Olam International’s (OLAM.SI) Cocoa Vice President in Brazil, Kidambi Srinivasan, for example, called the 400,000 tonne per year target “an unlikely possibility” without higher market prices and more assistance to planters in areas including financing, training and supplies. Benchmark cocoa prices in New York CCc2 are currently running at about $2,500 a tonne, having bounced off a 10-year low of $1,756 hit in 2017 on worries of global oversupply. Other big processors in Brazil include Cargill, which has an 85,000 tonne plant in Ilhéus, and Barry Callebaut (BARN.S), the world’s biggest maker of industrial chocolate, which opened its first South American chocolate facility in Brazil in 2010. For some of the ranchers-turned-planters, the chance to undo some of the damage to the Amazon caused by ranching is as important as the money they can earn from cocoa. “There was a time when I thought: We shouldn’t have come here,” said Elido Trevisan, who arrived in Para to ranch in 1972 and cleared nearly 100 percent of his land.  “But now,” he said, “we can do something to compensate.” ($1 = 3.3372 reais) Reporting by Marcy Nicholson in New York and Marcelo Teixeira in Medicilandia, Brazil; Editing by Simon Webb, Richard Valdmanis and Brian Thevenot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/brazil-cocoa-environment/feature-chocolate-forests-can-cocoa-help-restore-the-amazon-idUKL1N1RP016,12 Apr 2018,"For

2018-04-12,"NEW YORK/MEDICILÂNDIA, Brazil (Reuters) - For years, Valdomiro Facchi has made a living ranching on land carved from the Amazon rainforest. He’s a small player in one of the world’s biggest environmental disasters. But now that his cattle have trampled the pastures to dust - and new laws prevent him from clearing fresh land - he has to find new income. “I want to diversify,” said the 68-year old rancher, outlining plans to plant cocoa trees on his 300 hectare plot in Brazil’s Para State. “I want to have the cocoa income when profit from cattle ranching fails.” Facchi illustrates a trend that is turning damaged parts of the Amazon basin green again and creating an usual alliance between the agriculture industry and conservationists. Brazil’s cattle ranchers are planting cocoa on their used-up pasture, with financial support from international environmental groups. That’s a big change. For decades, ranchers have been the engine of clear-cutting in the Amazon rainforest that has rendered an area nearly the size of Spain treeless. Environmentalists have argued the practice destroys wildlife habitat and undermines the planet’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide that causes global warming. “Besides being a means of avoiding deforestation, cocoa plantations favour the local, regional and national economy,” the international environmental group The Nature Conservancy said on its website. The young trees will also bring change to global cocoa markets. Brazil’s National Association of the Cocoa Processing Industry (AIPC) expects the surge in planting to help double the country’s output of the raw material in chocolate by 2028 to 400,000 tonnes a year. That increase would raise global output by about 5 percent.  The renewed planting could make Brazil one of the world’s top three cocoa growers again after the sector was decimated in the 1990s by a crop fungus called witches’ broom.

2018-04-12,"* Trial set for Australia’s biggest coal-fired power plant * Designed to create a new export industry for Australia * Japan exploring clean energy alternatives to nuclear By Byron Kaye SYDNEY, April 12 (Reuters) - Japan’s Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd will use a power station owned by top Australian electricity producer AGL Energy Ltd for a trial of coal-to-liquid hydrogen conversion, the companies and the Australian government said on Thursday. If successful, the companies said they would build a facility at AGL’s massive Loy Yang coal-fired power station, Australia’s biggest. Success could also establish a new export industry for the country, extracting hydrogen from coal then converting it to liquid for export to Japan. The trial comes amid a long-running clash between AGL and the Australian government over energy policy. AGL wants to close coal-fired power stations and become a 100 percent renewable energy firm by 2050, while the conservative government wants to reinforce a secure baseload energy supply following a string of major blackouts in recent years. Meanwhile Japan is keen to develop new clean energy sources amid uncertainty about its future use of nuclear power in the wake of the March 2011 disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. “It is critically important that we invest in the energy sources of the future and we effect the transition from older forms of generation to new forms of generation and we do so seamlessly,” said Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, speaking at the Loy Yang site in southeastern Victoria. Turnbull said his government was contributing A$50 million ($39 million) to the trial, which would create 400 local jobs. The companies involved in the project didn’t disclose details of their own investment. Engineering group Kawasaki Heavy has been keen to tap the coal-to-liquid hydrogen market and has been looking at using brown coal from Victoria, where supplies are plentiful. But it has hedged its bets with a project in Norway to derive hydrogen using power from hydroelectric dams and eventually wind farms. Using Australian coal requires removing its climate-changing carbon and burying it in old oil or gas wells there. For the trial, Kawasaki Heavy has also teamed up with Japan’s Marubeni Corp, J-Power Systems Corp and Iwatani Corp. “The global hydrogen market is booming,” said Kawasaki Heavy’s Eiichi Harada, Deputy General Manager of the firm Corporate Technology Division, in a joint statement released on behalf of the companies involved. The project “has the potential to deliver a critical option for future global energy needs”, he said. If the pilot is successful, the project would enter its commercial phase in the 2030s, according to the statement. The project is a “major turning point for CCS (carbon capture storage) in Australia by securing jobs, sustaining communities, and paving the way for a global hydrogen economy that combats climate change,” the Global CCS Institute said. But green lobby group Environment Victoria rejected claims the project would promote clean energy. “Japan doesn’t want dirty hydrogen. They want clean hydrogen but today’s announcement simply creates a plant that will lock-in dirty hydrogen,” Environment Victoria campaigns manager Nicholas Aberle said in a statement.

2018-04-12,"* Stocks undermined by worries about Middle East conflicts * Oil at highest level since late 2014, gold in demand By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, April 12 (Reuters) - Asian stocks came under pressure on Thursday as the threat of imminent U.S. military action in Syria rattled investors and sent oil prices to their highest levels since late 2014 on concerns about supply. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.3 percent while Japan’s Nikkei was down slightly. On Wednesday, the S&P 500 lost 0.55 percent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.36 percent while energy shares gained more than 1 percent on rising oil prices. Trump declared that missiles “will be coming” in Syria, taunting Russia for supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after a suspected chemical attack on rebels. Damascus and Moscow have denied any responsibility. His comments raised the prospect of direct conflict over Syria for the first time between the two world powers backing opposing sides in the seven-year-old civil war, which has also escalated a rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran. “Last year Russia and Syria did not shoot back against U.S. missiles. But this time the scale of possible attacks by the U.S. and possibly its allies seems larger. If Russia fires back, the war front will be bigger,” said Hidenori Suezawa, financial market analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities. “I don’t think we are heading into the World War Three but should there be a direct collision between the U.S. and Russia for the first time, that’s the sort of headline that would plunge stock prices,” he added. The tension intensified in another front as Saudi Arabia said its air defence forces intercepted three ballistic missiles fired at Riyadh and other cities by Yemen’s Houthis. Trump has also threatened to withdraw from a nuclear deal struck in 2015 with Tehran. Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities, said Trump’s perceived brinkmanship on many issues from Syria to tariffs on imports from major trading partners ahead of mid-term elections make it hard for markets to focus on economic fundamentals. “It’s as if Trump is doing chicken games against China, chicken games against companies and chicken games against markets... Even if economic fundamentals are strong, it will be difficult to focus just on them,” said Kuramochi. Fears of more confrontations in the Middle East have boosted oil prices as well as safe-haven assets such as gold. Both U.S. crude and global benchmark Brent traded at the highest levels since 2014 as geopolitical concerns overshadowed a surprise buildup in U.S. crude inventories. U.S. crude futures traded at $67.10 a barrel, having risen 8.1 percent so far this week. They have traded as high as $67.45 on Wednesday, a level last seen in December 2014. Brent traded at $72.26 a barrel, having touched a high of $73.09 on Wednesday. Gold stood at $1,353.10 per ounce, having climbed to $1,365.30. A break above its Jan. 25 high of $1,365.8 would take the yellow metal to a high last seen in August 2016. In the currency markets, the yen was helped by the risk averse mood. The dollar eased to 106.82 yen, having lost momentum after hitting a five-week high of 107.49 a week ago. The euro traded at $1.2370, having risen for a fourth day in a row on Wednesday. Still, the currency has mostly been in a holding pattern since late January. The Russian rouble steadied on Wednesday after two days of heavy selling due to worries about the Syrian conflict and new punitive sanctions by the United States. It closed around 62.59 to the dollar, still down more than 7 percent so far this week. The Turkish lira traded at 4.1383 per dollar after hitting a record low of 4.1944 on Wednesday. The lira is down more than two percent this week. Worries on the Middle East overwhelmed budding optimism that Washington and Beijing will work out a compromise to avert a trade war following Chinese President Xi Jinping’s speech on Tuesday. Given the uncertainties on diplomacy and trade, economic news is currently of secondary importance to investors. Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting on March 20-21 released on Wednesday showed all of its policymakers felt that the U.S. economy would firm further and that inflation would rise in the coming months. U.S. consumer inflation figures matched economists’ forecasts. Prices fell for the first time in 10 months from the previous month in March, but the core CPI rose 2.1 percent year-on-year, the largest advance since February 2017, as the drag from last year’s plunge in prices for cellphone service plans dropped out of the calculation.

They include five in China, two in southeast Asia and one in Europe, said Vivek Chandra, chief executive of Houston-based Texas LNG, declining to name the companies citing confidentiality reasons. The Chinese customers are a mix of large provincials, independent companies and small local governments, he said, speaking on the sidelines of the LNG Asia Pacific Congress in Singapore. “In Southeast Asia, one is with one of the state national gas companies and the other one is more of an entrepreneurial project of developing an integrated gas to power scheme,” he added. The Texas LNG export facility in Brownsville, in southern Texas, has a capacity of up to 4 million tonnes per year (tpy) and is being built in two phases of 2 million tpy each. The first phase is expected to begin production in 2023. “Out of the eight (companies we have signed the deals with), six of them either have LNG terminals today” or are in the process of setting up one, he said.

U.S. President Donald Trump warned Russia on Wednesday of imminent military action in Syria, declaring missiles “will be coming” which led to major U.S. indices falling between 0.4 percent and 0.9 percent. On Thursday, the S&P/ASX 200 index slipped 0.3 percent, or 14.5 points, to 5,814.2 by 0223 GMT. It fell 0.5 percent on Wednesday. The financial index contributed the most to the benchmark’s weakness, losing as much as 0.7 percent. Commonwealth Bank of Australia weighed on the main index the most, dropping as much as 0.9 percent. Westpac Banking Corp was the second-largest contributor to the benchmark’s fall, down as much as 1.1 percent. “The money is coming out of the banks...if you see the trade yesterday, banks were hit in the morning, lunch time and the close,” said Mathan Somasundaram, market portfolio strategist, Blue Ocean Equities. “That is a general habit global traders are playing and it looks like it is happening again this morning and they are hitting our banks, so it is reducing global exposure into Australia.” Energy stocks traded as much as 0.4 percent higher after turnover on the Shanghai crude oil contracts for September delivery shot to the highest since their launch last week, supplementing the run-up in oil prices on Wednesday. Oil prices hit their highest since late-2014 on Wednesday following Trump’s comments about Syria and Saudi Arabia saying it intercepted missiles over Riyadh. Resource stocks were clear gainers on Thursday, with the Australian mining index firming up to 0.9 percent. Global miners Rio Tinto and BHP traded up as much as 0.9 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively. New Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index slipped 0.8 percent, or 66.46 points, to 8,387.26, as most sectors dropped. Health care stocks and consumer staples were the biggest factors in the direction of trade with medical devices maker Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corp Ltd and dairy firm a2 Milk Company Ltd losing as much as 2.1 percent each. New Zealand said on Thursday it would not grant any new permits for offshore oil and gas exploration, taking the industry by surprise with a decision that it said would push investment overseas. The government said the move would not affect the country’s 22 existing exploration permits, and any oil and gas discoveries from firms holding those licences could still lead to mining permits of up to 40 years. Petroleum explorer New Zealand Oil and Gas Ltd on Thursday said it does not expect any adverse impact on business from the decision. Its shares dropped as much as 4.8 percent to the lowest since July, 2017, on Thursday. Also on Thursday, New Zealand’s stock exchange operator (NZX) approved the Hong Kong Exchange, the Singapore Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange as recognised stock exchanges for equity listings. The deal allows for dual listing for market participants and exemptions from nearly all NZX listing rules.

2018-04-12,"SYDNEY, April 12 (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull acknowledged on Thursday that legislation aimed at preventing foreign interference in politics had soured ties with China, after a report Australian ministers were being denied Chinese visas. Relations between Australia and its largest trading partner have been strained over the past year, partly over Australian concern about rising Chinese influence, which led to the introduction of legislation banning foreign political donations. The Australian Financial Review, citing unidentified sources, said this week China had denied visas to Australian government officials to attend a major annual trade show, denting close economic ties between the two countries. “There’s clearly been some tension in the relationship following the introduction of our legislation about foreign interference but I’m very confident that any misunderstandings will be resolved,” Turnbull told 3AW Radio in Melbourne. He declined to comment when asked about the report that Australian ministers were being denied visas. The foreign ministry did not respond to emailed requests for comment. Late last year, Turnbull referred to “disturbing reports about Chinese influence” and warned of foreign powers’ “unprecedented and increasingly sophisticated attempts to influence the political process”. The Australian legislation, which is expected to be passed soon, also requires the registration of lobbyists working for foreign countries. China bought A$93 billion ($70 billion) worth of Australian goods and services last year, but trade ties are only one side of a delicate balancing act for Australia, whose unshakeable security relationship with the United States has limited how close it gets with China. Encouraged by the United States, Australia has sharpened its criticism of China’s activities in the Pacific and the South China Sea. Australia’s International Development Minister Concetta Fierravanti-Wells in January accused China of funding “roads to nowhere” and “useless buildings” in the Pacific, amid fears Canberra’s historical dominance in the region was eroding.

Brent crude futures were at $71.98 per barrel at 0016 GMT, down 8 cents from their last close. U.S. WTI crude futures were at $66.83 a barrel, virtually unchanged from their last settlement. Both Brent and WTI hit 2014 highs of $73.09 and $67.45 per barrel on Wednesday, respectively, after Saudi Arabia said it intercepted missiles over Riyadh and U.S. President Donald Trump warned Russia of imminent military action in Syria. “Geopolitical risks outweighed an unexpected rise in inventories in the U.S.,” ANZ bank said on Thursday. U.S. crude oil inventories C-STK-T-EIA rose by 3.3 million barrels to 428.64 million barrels. Meanwhile, U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA last week hit a fresh record of 10.53 million barrels per day (bpd), up by a quarter since mid-2016. The United States now produces more crude than top exporter Saudi Arabia. Only Russia, at currently just under 11 million bpd, pumps out more.

2018-04-12,"NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering allowing the sale of a higher ethanol fuel blend in the summer, a source familiar with the issue said, a move that would placate corn growers worried about the future of U.S. biofuels policy. President Donald Trump recently met with the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to discuss ways to make the Renewable Fuel Standard less expensive to the oil industry without undercutting demand for ethanol. The RFS requires refiners to add increasing volumes of biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the nation’s fuel supply each year which is a boon to farmers but a headache for refining companies that must either blend the fuels themselves or purchase credits from those who do. Trump has tried in vain over the past several months to broker a deal between “Big Oil” and “Big Corn” over the issue, and has faced mounting pressure from lawmakers in the Midwest who are concerned that he will weaken domestic demand for ethanol at a time farmers are already facing a potential trade war with China that could hurt export demand for corn and soybeans. Sources had told Reuters this week that Trump was temporarily suspending his consideration of a refining industry-backed proposal to cap prices for blending credits, an idea that the biofuels industry has opposed as damaging to farmers. But in the meantime, the administration is considering moving forward with plans to allow for the ethanol industry’s long sought waiver to sell gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol in the summer, instead of the usual 10 percent blend, the source familiar with the issue told Reuters on Wednesday. The higher ethanol blend, called E15, is currently banned by the Environmental Protection Agency due to concerns it contributes to smog on hot days, a worry that biofuels advocates say is baseless. If done soon, the waiver could be in effect in time for the 2018 summer driving season. EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. White House spokeswoman Kelly Love did not comment on the E15 waiver but said that during Trump’s meeting Monday he “instructed his Cabinet to continue to explore options that protect American farmers and America’s refinery workers.” Biofuels proponents have heaped pressure on the White House after reports that the EPA was granting dozens of small refineries exemptions from the RFS to help them avoid the costs of compliance, something the ethanol industry says will weaken demand for their product. On Monday, Trump acknowledged farmers may bear the brunt of the economic harm if China retaliates against Washington’s threat of tariffs, noting that “we’ll make it up to them”. Many U.S. farmers are battling debt after years of excess global supplies and depressed prices. “We need some good news out here,” said Monte Shaw, the Executive Director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association. “The best news (Trump) could give us right now is year-round sales of E15,” he said.

2018-04-12,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - EDP-Energias de Portugal is optimistic about renewable power investments in the United States, despite President Donald Trump’s push to support coal and nuclear power plants and a tariff his administration slapped on imported solar panels, its chief executive said in an interview. “U.S. renewables represent the growth engine of our company,” António Mexia, who since 2006 has run the power utility EDP (EDP.LS), one of Portugal’s biggest companies, said in an interview on Tuesday.  U.S. wind and solar power projects represented 65 percent of new investments last year at EDP’s renewables arm EDPR (EDPR.LS), and are expected to continue at that rate in 2018 and in 2019, Mexia said. EDPR operates renewable projects in 11 other countries in Europe and the Americas. This month, EDPR and four other companies joined with a Northern California power provider to develop an offshore wind farm with advanced floating turbines, expected to have the capacity to generate between 100 to 150 megawatts (MW). The group is talking with fishing industry and Department of Defense representatives about locations for the wind farm. Mexia said floating technology needs to be proven commercially, but tests for the last five years off the coast of Portugal have shown the floating turbines, which use technology similar to floating oil rigs, have survived waves up to 56 feet (17 m) high. “Traditional offshore (wind power) surprised everybody and I am sure floating offshore will do the same,” Mexia said. The advantage of floating platforms, to be placed about 20 miles (32 km) offshore in deep water, is their increased efficiency, which he expects will reach between 50 and 60 percent of rated peak capacity. That’s up from about 37 percent efficiency, which the U.S. Energy Information Administration said was the wind power industry’s average in 2017.         EDPR also invests in U.S. solar power, but its latest project is carefully planned to begin operations after the phase out of a tariff on imported solar panels that Trump signed into law on Jan. 23. The 30 percent tariff on the panels drops to 15 percent a few years later before being phased out entirely. EDPR has secured a 200 MW power purchase agreement on the solar project with Hoosier Energy Rural Electric Cooperative in Indiana, with the start of operations expected in 2022. Mexia, who was in Washington for a summit of leaders of the global electric power industry, said he is confident wind power will thrive in the United States because there are nearly 1,000 U.S. plants and companies that make parts or source parts for turbines, ensuring the renewables sector has broad support nationwide. Coal will have a role in the near future, he said, but eventually he expects it is an “industry that will disappear” despite efforts by the Trump administration to slash regulations on coal and to use subsidies to support struggling power plants that burn the fossil fuel.  Coal was an important resource domestically for EDP last year. EDP posted a weaker-than-expected 2017 profit after its revenue fell 6 percent as a severe drought in Portugal and Spain sapped its reservoirs for hydropower and forced it to resort to more expensive power generation including coal and combined cycle plants, the company said in March.  Despite the Trump administration’s policies to support coal and nuclear plants, Mexia sees the United States a preferable place to invest in renewables than many countries in Europe.  And Mexia is hopeful that Trump’s policies will not spark a U.S. trade war with China, that could affect EDP. The company’s biggest shareholder is China Three Gorges, a Chinese state-owned power company, which owns a nearly 24 percent stake.   “It’s a game where nobody wins,” Mexia said of trade wars.

2018-04-12,"* China boosts underground gas storage after winter supply crunch * China’s underground storage just 5 pct of consumption * Investment sought to double storage capacity * Demand for stored gas seen boosting imports to record highs By Chen Aizhu CHONGQING, China, April 12 (Reuters) - On one of the many mountains in southwest China’s sprawling region of Chongqing, a dozen wells in an exhausted gas field are this week starting to take in fresh fuel piped in from Central Asia’s Turkmenistan, thousands of miles away. For the next six months, state energy giant PetroChina, operator of the Xiangguosi storage facility, will also inject gas from Myanmar to fill the vast chambers 3,000 metres (9,900 ft) under the mountaintop. China is aiming to turn hundreds of tapped and some still producing wells into storage facilities after a severe winter supply crunch left it short of the clean-burning fuel. Beijing is trying to switch more of its energy use to gas from coal to help clear up the foul air in the country’s north. The drive to fill up the country’s 25 underground gas storage sites before winter arrives will also bolster imports of liquefied natural gas in the world’s No.3 gas user. Consultancy Wood Mackenzie expects imports to touch 48-49 million tonnes this year, up a quarter from last year’s record level. China’s underground gas storages (UGS) can barely cover 5 percent of its total consumption, lagging behind the international average of 10-12 percent and leaving it vulnerable to supply shocks or extreme weather conditions. While the state planning agency has stressed the urgency of adding underground facilities, China’s regulated gas pricing and near-monopoly in key distribution infrastructure remain hurdles to clear for the business to flourish. Led by PetroChina, China has embarked on a building boom over the next 5-8 years, spending over $10 billion to nearly double gas stores. MAN-MADE GAS FIELD Building a UGS is almost like developing a new gasfield - costly, time-consuming and requiring management skills to ensure safe operations. China built its first UGS in 1999, the Dazhangtuo site near Beijing, and has since added 24 storage facilities with a total volume of 11 billion cubic metres (bcm). Almost all the current sites are built from tapped or producing gas wells, the easiest and most cost-effective solution, said Ding Guosheng, of PetroChina’s UGS Institute, which is responsible for designing and planning the facilities. It takes nearly two years of well testing and data analysis to identify wells suitable for storages and another three to five years to design and build. “You need to make sure that dried wells don’t have leaks, detect where and how much water, oil or gas still wanders under there,” said Ding. “We make sure the rocks are strong enough to sustain larger pressure when it’s turned into a storage.” To build a storage, new wells are drilled to inject and extract gas, and pipelines and compressors added to gather and pump the fuel into the network. Policy-setters are soliciting industry feedback to create a business model to boost investment from outside the dominant state majors, including exploring the feasibility of trading gas storage at a new exchange in Chongqing. “Without government policy support and market-driven pricing no company would want to invest....as it’s expensive to build and costly to operate,” said Han Jingkuan, president of PetroChina’s Planning and Engineering Institute. China regulates gas prices by setting the wholesale city-gate rates and allows fuel producers to charge 20 percent more in peak winter sales. Beijing has for decades been subsidizing residential users. “In the absence of a commercial model...it remains a job for the national oil companies,” said Luo Jing, vice president of gas development of privately-run China Gas Holdings. But third-party investment is being sought. Ma Xinhua, PetroChina’s top official for UGS business, said in March the state firm was in advanced talks with Chongqing government to co-invest in several storages in the gas-rich southwest. With gas deposits buried at wells deeper than 3,000 metres and many located in the densely populated and mountainous southwest, China faces technical and safety challenges. In the United States, the world’s top gas consumer, abundant and shallow salt domes are often used for storage. In its relatively short 20-year UGS history, PetroChina has tapped limited foreign expertise, having only hired U.S. gas company Enron for designing the first facility in the late 1990s and recently France’s Storengy for technical appraisals. But as China considers less familiar geological features such as aquifers and salt caverns, operational and management skills may come in handy from experienced players like Russian gas giant Gazprom and French storage expert Geostock. Gazprom, which operates storage sites seven times the size of China’s, entered into a pre-feasibility study with PetroChina in January to build a facility at Shengping in northeast China. The storage, also a tapped gas field, is planned to service “Power of Siberia”, the mega pipeline due to send gas from Siberia to China from around 2020. “(China faces) huge challenges as technical complexity will increase,” said Marc Fauveau, of business development with Storengy.

2018-04-12,"(Repeats item with no changes to text) * Policy support, incentives propelled growth in Thai energy firms * Energy company IPOs raised over $2 billion in 2016-2017 * Companies invest abroad to secure growth as local demand slows By Chayut Setboonsarng and Henning Gloystein BANGKOK/SINGAPORE, April 11 (Reuters) - Thai energy companies are on a roll. The national oil and gas champion, a coal miner and power utility, upstart solar and wind companies, virtually all are expanding across Southeast Asia, applying practices and technology developed at home. Thailand is reaping the benefits of two decades of government energy policies that have supported the sector. Companies are also profiting from oil and gas prices that are recovering from a three-year slump, increasing electricity demand due to economic growth, and renewable technologies that have become competitive against fossil fuels. Also, while the military junta that has ruled Thailand since mid-2014 has put no stamp of its own on the energy sector, it has targeted infrastructure spending to boost the economy and prioritised investment in hi-tech industries. Long-standing reform policies have turned Thailand’s state energy company PTT into a successful international oil and gas producer, encouraged the development of power producers such as Electricity Generating, and fostered the emergence of renewable start-ups like Energy Absolute. “The power businesses in Thailand have developed expertise in this sector, and are now well placed to support energy development across the region,” said Robert Grant, Asia Pacific head at Canadian-listed SNC-Lavalin, an engineering and construction firm focused on energy, infrastructure and mining. The 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) together have a population of more than 600 million people, with a collective gross domestic product (GDP) of nearly $3 trillion, according to research company Statista. ASEAN’s energy use rose by 60 percent in the last 15 years, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), which also says the region’s demand could grow another two-thirds by 2040. Companies aiming to take part in the growth in ASEAN and beyond include B.Grimm Power, a Thai power developer that already has assets in Vietnam and Laos, and Banpu Power , which is building a coal-fired plant in China. “You can already see increased activity by Thai investors in the ASEAN region,” Grant said. The expansion has been reflected in the local stock exchange, with shares of energy companies growing nearly 75 percent since the start of 2016, against a broader market gain of less than half that. It’s also sparked a rash of listings, with Thai power companies having raised more than $2 billion from initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2016 and 2017. Thailand’s third-biggest generator, Gulf Energy, in December held the biggest listing the country has seen in a decade, at more than $700 million. Gulf has said it expects revenue to grow by 18 percent this year, fuelled in part by a major solar investment in Vietnam. The IPO funds will be used to repay loans and finance new regional power plants, it says. Government policy “created an ecosystem for growth for Thai energy companies,” said Maria Lapiz, head of institutional research at Maybank Kim Eng Securities, with the first reforms coming in the 1990s. That’s when the government began allowing small power generators (1-90 megawatts) to sell to the national grid. Thailand was also an earlier adopter of natural gas, which now generates about 60 percent of its electricity. In 2012, Thailand was one of Asia’s first countries to introduce “feed-in” tariffs to give solar developers additional payments on top of normal prices when selling electricity to utilities, channelling investment into the sector. Similar tariffs have been applied to other renewable power sources, including wind, small-scale hydro, biomass and biogas. The privatisation of PTT was another big boost to the energy sector. The government now holds a 51 percent stake in PTT, which operates as a private company with less political interference than state rivals like Malaysia’s Petronas and Indonesia’s Pertamina, both of which remain under full government control. “PTT was privatised in 2001, which helped drive growth in the energy sector from E&P to refiners and helped in the development of the Thai capital market,” said Lapiz. The growth trend is clearest in renewables, where Thailand is the first Southeast Asia nation to crack the top 15 solar power generators, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). “Thailand started development in renewable power much earlier than regional peers,” said Thidasiri Srisamith, Chief Investment Officer of Kasikorn Asset Management. Thanks to the early start and good relationships with neighbouring governments, Thailand is “a leader in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam, and will continue to expand into these countries,” she said. Thailand’s largest solar company, Superblock, plans to branch out with a $1.8 billion investment into wind farms in Vietnam. And Thailand’s biggest wind power generator, Wind Energy Holdings, plans to invest in solar, hydro and biomass to back up its capacity, not just locally but also in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Australia. Even in coal, a sector recently shunned due to public pressure to invest in cleaner energy, Thai firms are growing. Miner Banpu in February reported a more than 250 percent surge in annual profit, partly because of new coal mine investments, including in Indonesia, and power projects in China and Japan. In oil and gas, PTT - long the global carrier of the Thai exploration and production flag - is developing new assets in the region for the first time in years, with around $4.5 billion in cash on hand to invest at home and overseas. Not all indicators point to an ongoing boom. Local consumption is stalling due to low population growth and improvements in energy efficiency, while domestic capacity is sufficient to meet basic requirements. “Going forward, Thai power company growth will depend on the ability to secure capacity and have a steady stream of projects ... which (are) increasingly coming from overseas,” said Kasikorn’s Thidasiri.
