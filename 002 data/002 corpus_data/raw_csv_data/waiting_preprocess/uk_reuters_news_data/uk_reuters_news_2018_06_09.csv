2018-06-09,"BAQUBA, Iraq (Reuters) - At least two people were killed and 20 were wounded after a bomb went off on Saturday at a market in the Iraqi town of Khalis in Diyala province, security sources said. No further details were immediately available on who was targeted or who was responsible for the blast, which happened a before sunset when Muslims break their fast during the holy month of Ramadan.  Diyala is a mixed province where both Sunni Arabs and Shi’ite Arabs live. Iraq declared victory over Islamic State in December. But security officials have said the hardline militant group is likely to wage an insurgency in Iraq after its self-proclaimed caliphate collapsed and the militants were dislodged from all the territory they held in the country. A local official said earlier this week that the militants had become active again in areas between the Diyala and the neighbouring Salahuddin province.

2018-06-09,"GABORONE, June 9 (Reuters) - Botswana has scrapped talks to sell a power station plagued by technical problems to a state-owned Chinese company linked to the plant’s builder, an official document seen by Reuters showed. The 600-megawatt coal-fired Morupule B plant, which was commissioned in 2012 and built by China National Electric Equipment Corporation (CNEEC) at a cost of $970 million, has often broken down, leading to a reliance on diesel generators and imports from South Africa. Botswana has been in exclusive negotiations since November 2016 to sell the plant to state-owned China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC), which is related to CNEEC. In a notice seen by Reuters on Friday, the African country’s Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Board (PPADB) said it had approved a request from the Ministry of Energy to cancel the sale tender. “The board has approved the request for authority to cancel the tender for divestment of government of Botswana and Botswana Power Corporation (BPC) financial interest in Morupule B,” read the notice. Government officials were not immediately available to comment. Power generation at Morupule B has improved in the last year due to remedial works and it currently operates at about 81 percent capacity, helping the power utility reduce imports. Botswana has a maximum electricity demand of 520 MW, which is seen rising by 65 percent in the next seven years to 856 MW in 2025. Cancellation of the Morupule B tender comes after a planned $800 million expansion of the coal-fired power plant by Japan’s Marubeni Corp and South Korea’s Posco Energy stalled due to a disagreement over terms.

2018-06-09,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s oil production increased to 11.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first week of June, far exceeding production limits outlined in a global oil deal, Interfax news agency cited a source as saying on Saturday. Russia agreed to cut its production by 300,000 bpd from 11.247 million bpd as part of a global pact. The Russian Energy Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Interfax said Russian oil production stood on average at 1.513 million tonnes per day in the first week of the month and never got below 1.511 million tonnes. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other leading oil producers including Russia will meet in Vienna on June 22-23 to discuss the future of the deal, which is valid until the end of the year.  Russia and OPEC leader Saudi Arabia have signaled there could be a need to gradually boost production to prevent any supply shortages.  Most Russian oil majors have supported the increase in oil production as prices have reached $80 per barrel last month. Currently, oil LCOc1 is trading at more than $76 per barrel. Vladimir Putin has said a price of $60 “suits” Russia. Russian oil output was stagnant at 10.97 million barrels per day (bpd) for a third month in a row in May.

2018-06-09,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis warned that climate change risked destroying humanity on Saturday and called on energy leaders to help the world to convert to clean fuels to avert catastrophe. “Civilization requires energy but energy use must not destroy civilization,” the pope told top oil company executives at the end of a two-day conference in the Vatican. Climate change was a challenge of “epochal proportions”, he said, adding that the world needed an energy mix that combated pollution, eliminated poverty and promoted social justice. The conference, held behind closed doors at the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, brought together oil executives, investors and Vatican experts who, like the pope, back scientific opinion that climate change is caused by human activity. “We know that the challenges facing us are interconnected. If we are to eliminate poverty and hunger ... the more than one billion people without electricity today need to gain access to it,” the pope told them. “Our desire to ensure energy for all must not lead to the undesired effect of a spiral of extreme climate changes due to a catastrophic rise in global temperatures, harsher environments and increased levels of poverty,” he said. The oil and gas industry has come under growing pressure from investors and activists to play a bigger role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions to meet goals set out in a 2015 climate agreement signed in Paris. Companies are betting on increased demand for gas, the least polluting fossil fuel, and to a lesser extent on renewable power such as wind and solar to meet global targets of net zero emissions by the end of the century. Among the some 50 participants were Darren Woods, CEO of ExxonMobil, Claudio Descalzi, head of Italy’s ENI, Bob Dudley of BP, Eldar Saetre, CEO of Norwegian oil firm Equinor (formerly called Statoil), Vicki Hollub of Occidental Petroleum, and investors including Larry Fink of BlackRock. Francis, who wrote a major document called “Laudato Si” (Praised Be) on protecting the environment from global warming in 2015, said it was “worrying” that there still was a continuing search for new fossil fuel reserves. He said the transition to accessible and clean energy was “a duty that we owe towards millions of our brothers and sisters around the world, poorer countries and generations yet to come”. The pope also called for a global, long-term common project: “Environmental and energy problems now have a global impact and extent,” he said.

2018-06-09,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s transport minister has sharply criticised the country’s environment minister for planning tougher emissions rules for cars in the European Union, as the government struggles to find a way to cut pollution while protecting jobs. “We don’t need arbitrary, political-ideological emission limits ..., but realistic, technically feasible limits,” Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer told Der Spiegel magazine, adding: “I do not participate in the destruction of a leading European industry!” Germany’s Environment Ministry has drawn up a position paper suggesting CO2 emissions from cars and light commercial vehicles should be halved by 2030 compared with 2021 levels, documents seen by Reuters showed on Wednesday. That compares with proposals from the European Commission for a 30 percent reduction. German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze also wants a 25 percent reduction by 2025 compared with a 15 percent decline envisaged by the European Commission. Earlier this week, Schulze said German carmakers had a moral obligation to refit heavily polluting diesel vehicles on the country’s roads, but she also conceded that the government had no legal means to make them do so. In an interview published in Die Welt newspaper on Monday, Schulze said refits could first be carried out on cars on the road in particularly polluted cities. By targeting areas most affected, the costs of such refits need only be “in the low single-digit billions”, she said. Revelations in the wake of Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) emissions scandal that nitrogen oxide emissions of diesel cars are much higher than previously thought have led to tougher regulations, and in some cases fines, on carmakers.  Diesel emissions have also led to several German cities exceeding European Union air pollution limits, which has triggered enforcement action by the European Commission. Some diesel vehicle owners are also seeking compensation from Volkswagen, which admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. emissions tests. In a response to a parliamentary question from a Green Party lawmaker, deputy justice minister Rita Hagl-Kehl said the government had “no insight” into how many diesel car customers may have outstanding claims, business daily Handelsblatt will report on Monday, according to an advance release.

2018-06-09,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China will expand environmental inspections to more cities and regions in a new round of checks from this month to April next year, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) said in a statement on Friday, part of a three-year anti-pollution plan.  Apart from smog-heavy Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and nearby areas, the inspections - to run from June 11 to April 28, 2019 -  will also target the Yangtze River Delta region, including Shanghai, and Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces, and some 11 cities in the northwestern provinces of Shanxi and Shaanxi.  Two hundred teams with a total of some 18,000 inspectors and support staff will be sent out, tripling the workforce for the inspections carried out during this past winter. The curbs and other anti-pollution measures have added to industry costs and disrupted growth. In China’s steel capital of Tangshan, GDP growth fell to 5.6 percent in the first quarter of this year, when winter production restrictions were most intense, dropping from 6.7 percent in the third quarter of 2017.  “The intensified environmental checks will focus on industrial, energy, transportation and land-use sectors, and continue to enforce production staggering and coal-to-gas conversion,” said the MEE in its statement.  Industrial plants were asked to cut as much as 50 percent of their output capacity on heavy pollution days this past winter, and millions of households and industrial shops were ordered to switch their heating systems from coal to electricity in a bid to reduce toxic emissions. In 2018, the country aims to convert another 4 million homes to natural gas or electricity.  For the six winter months of October 2017 to March 2018, Beijing ordered 28 cities to cut concentrations of small breathable particles known as PM2.5 by 10-25 percent to head off public anger over rising pollution.      “Despite improvements in some regions, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei remains the most polluted place in the country, while the Shanxi-Shaanxi region saw air quality worsen in recent years,” the MEE said.  Last week, inspection teams arrived in 10 regions, including Hebei and Jiangsu, to revisit thousands of violations uncovered by earlier Beijing-led probes, pressuring local authorities to beef up their anti-pollution curbs.      While keeping pressure on PM2.5 levels, Beijing will also target volatile organic chemical (VOC) emissions, the main cause of ozone pollution, in the new anti-pollution campaign, Wu Xianfeng, deputy director at the MEE’s Department of Air Environmental Management, said at a conference on Saturday.  Rising ozone pollution, mainly during summer months, in Chinese cities has caused an increase in deaths from strokes and heart disease, according to a study last year by a team of Chinese researchers. VOCs are produced by burning fossil fuels and are found in petrochemicals, printing inks, paints, and other industrial and consumer chemicals.  Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, Shanxi-Shaanxi in the northwest, and Sichuan-Chongqing in the southwest are the main regions in need of VOC controls, Wu said.  Last year, China emitted around 25 million tonnes of VOCs, up 25 percent from 10 years ago.

The Shanxi-Shaanxi region accounted for 41 percent of China’s coal output in 2017. The two provinces’ mining, coal freight and coal-fired power plants will be key focuses of the coming inspections, according to the MEE’s plan.
