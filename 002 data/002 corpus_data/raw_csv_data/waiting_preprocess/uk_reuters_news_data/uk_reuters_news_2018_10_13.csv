2018-10-13,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday the United States would be “punishing” itself by halting military sales to Saudi Arabia even if it is proven that Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed inside the country’s consulate in Istanbul.  Khashoggi, a prominent critic of Riyadh and a U.S. resident,  disappeared on Oct. 2 after visiting the Saudi consulate. Turkey’s government believes he was deliberately killed inside the building and his body removed.  Trump has forged closer ties with Saudi Arabia and is under international and domestic pressure to help determine what happened to Khashoggi and punish Saudi Arabia if investigations show its government had him killed.  Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike have demanded firm action. There was already mounting concern over civilian deaths caused by a Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen’s civil war and some lawmakers have said Washington should block military sales to Riyadh if the allegations over Khashoggi are proven.  But Trump is firmly opposed. “I actually think we’d be punishing ourselves if we did that,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “There are other things we can do that are very, very powerful, very strong and we’ll do them,” he added, without saying what those measures might be. Under U.S. law, major foreign military sales can be blocked by Congress. An informal review process lets key lawmakers use a practice known as a “hold” to stall deals if they have concerns such as whether the weapons being supplied would be used to kill civilians. Major U.S. defence contractors, including Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co, are among the beneficiaries of Washington’s close ties to Riyadh and would be hurt by the halting of major arms deals. Trump said on Saturday his administration won a $110 billion military order from Saudi Arabia and that the deal, combined with Saudi commitments to invest heavily in the United States, was worth hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs. “If they don’t buy it from us, they’re going to buy it from Russia or they’re going to buy it from China,” he said. “Think of that, $110 billion. All they’re going to do is give it to other countries, and I think that would be very foolish.” It was unclear what specific measures, if any, Trump is  considering against Saudi Arabia, which is the world’s largest oil exporter, and one of his top allies.  The Trump administration plans to reimpose sanctions on oil exports from Iran on Nov. 5 and Trump has urged Saudi Arabia to boost oil output to help make up for the loss.  Trump said he would probably speak to Saudi Arabia’s King Salman over the weekend “because I think it’s appropriate for me to ask him what’s going on.” Reporting by Julia Harte and Timothy Gardner; Editing by Kieran Murray and Marguerita Choy",https://uk.reuters.com/article/saudi-politics-dissident-trump/update-5-trump-says-u-s-would-be-punishing-itself-if-it-halts-saudi-arms-sales-idUKL2N1WT06O,13 Oct 2018,"U.S. President Donald Trump

2018-10-13,"HOUSTON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil and gas production is returning to near normal levels three days after Hurricane Michael made landfall on the Florida Panhandle, data from an offshore regulator showed on Saturday, with oil output off 19 percent and natural gas production down less than 10 percent. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) also said in an midday update that only one evacuated production platform was still unoccupied, down from 89 platforms on Wednesday. It can take several days after a storm passes to inspect platforms for damages, fully return crews and restore production after wells are shut-in ahead of a storm. Michael entered the Gulf as a tropical storm and quickly spun into a major hurricane, producing rough seas and winds of up to 155 miles per hour (250 kph) when it made landfall near Panama City, Florida, on Wednesday. As of midday on Saturday, the storm had left at least 18 dead in four Southeast U.S. states and damages to communities in its path were estimated in the billions of dollars. It was one of the most powerful storms recorded in U.S. history. The Gulf production still offline on Saturday morning represented 330,394 barrels per day of oil production and 247 million cubic feet per day of natural gas output, BSEE reported from a survey of 17 oil and gas producers. In all, Michael cost Gulf producers about 3.27 million barrels of oil this week. Offshore production in federal waters of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico accounts for 17 percent of total U.S. crude output and 5 percent of national natural gas production, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. BSEE said its Saturday survey of producers showed that all drilling rigs and vessels that had been evacuated or moved to safer areas of the Gulf ahead of the storm were reoccupied and back at their drilling positions.

2018-10-13,"BLACKPOOL, England (Reuters) - British energy company Cuadrilla said on Saturday the planned start of fracking a shale gas well at its Lancashire, north west England, site has been delayed by poor weather. The privately owned company had said on Friday it would commence fracking at the site on Saturday after a court removed the final hurdle to the first hydraulic fracturing in Britain in seven years. But heavy rain and strong winds halted the works. “We won’t actually be starting the hydraulic fracturing pumps today due to a brief delay with the weather conditions yesterday and this morning, so we’ll therefore be starting on Monday,” said a Cuadrilla spokesman. The firm will spend three months fracking two horizontal wells, which involves injecting sand, water and chemicals to split the tightly packed shale rock and induce gas to flow out. This will be the first fracking of a horizontal shale gas well since a 2011 attempt by Cuadrilla caused earth tremors, prompting protests, tighter regulations and delays. A local resident wanted the fracking suspended to allow for a judicial review of the local council’s safety procedures, but a High Court judge dismissed the case on Friday. About 25 anti-fracking protesters and a small police presence were at the site on Saturday.     Reporting by Andrew Yates, writing by James Davey.

2018-10-13,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German utility RWE (RWEG.DE) might have to cut jobs at its Hambach site following a court ruling that will delay plans to expand the mine by clearing an ancient forest, its chief executive was quoted as saying on Saturday. CEO Rolf Martin Schmitz told the Rheinische Post newspaper that it was not yet clear how many jobs would go, but it would discuss the matter with trade unions and the works council, adding he could not rule out forced redundancies. A court in the German city of Muenster ruled last week that RWE could not start logging in the Hambach forest until a separate court had reviewed environmental claims, which RWE said would push back mining until after 2020 and hit its earnings. The RWE mine at Hambach employs 4,600 people. Earlier this week, RWE said output at the mine would decline by 10 to 15 million tonnes a year from its current level of 40 million tonnes due to the ruling. In a separate interview published by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Saturday, Schmitz said the hit to earnings would probably be about 100 to 200 million euros ($116 million - $231 million) a year. Even if the clearing is allowed to go ahead, the lignite output of the mine will probably not reach previous levels, with Schmitz forecasting a permanent reduction of about 5 million tonnes a year due to the delay.

2018-10-13,"NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) - Egypt is considering issuing bonds in currencies other than the euro and the U.S. dollar after launching a roadshow in Asia, Finance Minister Mohamed Maait told Reuters on Saturday, as the government steps up efforts to improve its debt structure.  The minister met investors in Seoul last week and plans to continue the marketing trip to Singapore, Japan and Malaysia among other countries, Maait said in an interview on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual meetings in the resort island of Bali. Egypt raised 2 billion euro in bonds in April, its first issue in the single currency, and is planning to sell more euro-denominated debt next year.     Maait said response from the non-deal roadshow in South Korea was “very positive” and the government had been “advised to try to issue in Asia”. “We are thinking about issuing in other currencies,” Maait said. “No decision has been made yet, but all options are open and we are considering it and we will make a decision in the near future.” The plan comes amid efforts to rearrange Egypt’s debt structure as it faces a tough foreign repayments schedule over the next two years, as well as a rising oil import bill. At the same time, foreign holdings of its government debt have fallen due to outflows amid emerging market turbulence.  In July, the government said foreign holdings of Egyptian treasuries had fallen to $17.5 billion at the end of June from $23.1 billion three months earlier. The government, which has borrowed heavily from abroad since it drew up an economic reform programme with the IMF in 2016, is planning to expand its investor base, lengthen maturity of its debt from short term, and seek cheaper borrowing, Maait said. Emerging markets have seen bond yields jump in recent months as outflows spiked due to escalating trade tension between the United States and China, and expectation for further hikes in U.S. interest rates as the American economy picks up speed. In its 2018/19 budget, Egypt is targeting average interest rates for government debt of 14.7 percent, down from 18.5 percent in fiscal year ending June 2018. To manage the cost of oil imports, Egypt has signed hedging contracts for its oil imports and everything was in place to launch this, the minister said.  “We are ready to press the button at any moment,” the minister said. Egypt is also looking into implementing similar insurance measures for other commodities including wheat, he said. The country is among the biggest importers of wheat in the world.
