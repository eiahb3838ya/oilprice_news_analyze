2018-10-05,"(Adds comments from U.S. government official) By Nidhi Verma NEW DELHI, Oct 5 (Reuters) - India will buy 9 million barrels of Iranian oil in November, two industry sources said, indicating the world’s third-biggest oil importer will continue purchasing crude from the Islamic republic despite U.S. sanctions coming into force on Nov. 4. “Refiners have placed November nominations to lift 1.25 million tonnes (about 9 million barrels) of oil from Iran,” one of the sources said. Indian Oil Corp will lift 6 million barrels of Iranian oil and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd 3 million barrels, the source told Reuters. The United States plans to impose new sanctions targeting Iran’s oil sector on Nov. 4 to try to stop the country’s involvement in conflicts in Syria and Iraq and bring Tehran to the negotiating table over its ballistic missile programme. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media. Indian Oil and Mangalore Refinery did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “India is continuing with its relationship with both its key energy partners Iran and the U.S.,” a second source said. A U.S. government official said the Trump administration is “in the midst of an internal process” of considering waivers for countries that are reducing imports of Iranian crude. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in India last month that the Trump administration would consider waivers for Iranian oil buyers such as India but they must eventually bring the imports to zero. Indian refiners imported around 10 million barrels of Iranian oil in October, and its November shipments are expected to be lower. In the previous round of sanctions from 2012 to 2015, India continued to buy Iranian crude although it had to cut purchases significantly to protect its wider exposure to the U.S. financial system. India’s foreign minister said in May it abides only by sanctions imposed by the United Nations and not those imposed by any other country. With the European Union considering the creation of a “special purpose vehicle” before November to facilitate trade with Iran, India hopes to find a way to settle payments to Tehran. “Previously there was no European channel,” the second source said. “This time Europe is not working with the U.S., so we intend to evolve a mechanism.” India, Iran’s top client after China, has close diplomatic ties with Iran, where it is building a strategic port called Chabahar that is expected to be operational by 2019. At the same time, India is closely working with the United States to further its strategic interests. “It is still early to say how India will settle its trade with Iran,” the first source said, adding that India could consider paying Iran for crude with the rupee currency.

2018-10-05,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is actively considering waivers on sanctions it will reimpose next month for countries that are reducing their imports of Iranian oil, a U.S. government official said on Friday.  The administration withdrew from a deal over Tehran’s nuclear programme in May and is unilaterally reimposing sanctions on Iran’s crude oil consumers on Nov. 4. The sanctions aim to force Tehran to stop its involvement in conflicts in Syria and Iraq and halt its ballistic missile programme. Iran says it has abided by the 2015 nuclear deal, which was struck with five other world powers, besides the United States.   The administration is “in the midst of an internal process” of considering exceptions called SRE waivers, or significant reduction exemptions, said a government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  It was the first time a U.S. official said the administration was in the process of considering waivers. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in India last month that the administration would consider waivers and that some buyers of Iranian oil would take a “little bit of time” to unwind their trade with Iran. White House National Security Adviser John Bolton said on Thursday that the administration’s objective was that there be no waivers and “exports of Iranian oil and gas and condensates drops to zero.” He added that the administration would not necessarily achieve that. The administration is “prepared to work with countries that are reducing their imports on a case-by-case basis,” the official said.  The comments followed news that India, Iran’s No. 2 oil customer after China, will buy 9 million barrels of Iranian oil in November. It was an indication that India will continue purchasing crude from Iran, despite the Trump administration’s push to get countries to stop their purchases.

2018-10-05,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the kingdom has met its promise to Washington to make up for Iranian crude oil supplies lost through U.S. sanctions. “The request that America made to Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries is to be sure that if there is any loss of supply from Iran, that we will supply that. And that happened,” Prince Mohammed told Bloomberg on Friday.  “Iran reduced their exports by 700,000 barrels a day, if I’m not mistaken. And Saudi Arabia and OPEC and non-OPEC countries, they’ve produced 1.5 million barrels a day. So we export as much as 2 barrels for any barrel that disappeared from Iran recently. So we did our job and more.” Russia and Saudi Arabia struck a private deal in September to raise oil output to cool rising prices and informed the United States before a meeting in Algiers with other producers, Reuters reported this week. [nL8N1WJ5M6]     U.S. President Donald Trump has blamed the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) for high crude prices and called on it to boost output to bring down fuel costs before the U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6.  Benchmark Brent oil LCOc1 rallied above $86 this week mainly stemming from a decline in oil exports from OPEC member Iran due to fresh U.S. sanctions. It settled at $84.16 a barrel on Friday. Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, has accused Trump of orchestrating the oil price rally by imposing sanctions on Tehran and accused its regional arch-rival Saudi Arabia of bowing to U.S. pressure. Saudi Arabia is the world’s top oil exporter and OPEC’s de-facto leader. The Saudi crown prince said the recent rise in oil prices was not due to Iran. “We believe the higher price that we have in the last month, it’s not because of Iran. It’s mostly because of things happening in Canada, and Mexico, Libya, Venezuela and other countries that moved the price a little bit higher,” he told Bloomberg.  “But Iran, definitely no. Because they reduced 700,000 barrels and we’ve exported more than 1.5 million barrels a day.” Saudi Arabic is now pumping about 10.7 million barrels per day and can add a further 1.3 million bpd of production “if the market needed that,” Prince Mohammed said. “We have spare capacity of 1.3 million without any investment... And with other OPEC countries and non-OPEC countries we believe we have more than that, a little bit more than that,” he said. “Of course there is opportunity for investment in the next three to five years.” Saudi Arabia is the only oil producer with significant spare capacity on hand to supply the market if needed. The kingdom has a maximum sustainable capacity of 12 million bpd. Prince Mohammed also said he hoped to resume oil production from the Neutral Zone, which Saudi Arabia shares with Kuwait, after resolving pending issues between the two Gulf OPEC allies. “We believe that we are almost close to having something with Kuwait. There are only small issues that have been stuck there for the last 50 years. The Kuwaiti side, they want to fix it today, before we continue to produce in that area,” he said. “We’re trying to have an agreement with the Kuwaitis to continue to produce for the next five to 10 years and at the same time, we work on the sovereignty issues.” The crown prince flew to Kuwait on Sunday to discuss the resumption of oil output from the Neutral Zone, a source familiar with the matter had told Reuters. [nL8N1WG061] The resumption of the Neutral Zone’s oilfields could add up to 500,000 bpd of oil output capacity to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

2018-10-05,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major world stock markets sank for a second straight day on Friday after strong U.S. jobs numbers signaled a continued tightening of the labor market and increased inflation pressures, while Treasury yields rose again to multi-year highs.    The increase in U.S. non-farm payrolls slowed in September, likely from Hurricane Florence’s impact on restaurant and retail payrolls, but the Labor Department report also showed a rise in wages that could keep the Federal Reserve on track for more interest rate hikes.  “The jobs report has become a inflation report,” said Russell Price, senior economist at Ameriprise Financial Services Inc in Troy, Michigan.

2018-10-05,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude futures steadied on Friday after climbing to four-year highs earlier this week, and both Brent and U.S. crude marked weekly gains ahead of U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil exports. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose 1 cent to settle at $74.34 a barrel. Global benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 futures for December delivery fell 42 cents to settle at $84.16 a barrel. On Wednesday, Brent hit its highest price since late 2014, at $86.74.  “They’re taking a pause after yesterday’s sell-off,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. WTI’s weekly gain was about 1.3 percent; Brent’s was around 1.4 percent. Price gains this week were limited by Saudi Arabia and Russia’s saying they would raise output to at least partly make up for expected disruptions from Iran, OPEC’s No. 3 producer, due to the U.S. sanctions that take effect on Nov. 4. Oil prices are up 15-20 since mid-August, at their highest levels since late 2014. Washington wants governments and companies around the world to stop buying Iranian oil to pressure Tehran into renegotiating a nuclear deal. Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman insisted the kingdom is fulfilling promises to make up for lost Iranian crude supplies, Bloomberg reported. Saudi Arabia is now pumping about 10.7 million barrels per day (bpd) and can add a further 1.3 million “if the market needs that,” he said. India will buy 9 million barrels of Iranian oil in November, two industry sources said, indicating that the world’s third-biggest oil importer will keep purchasing crude from the Islamic republic. Many analysts said they expected Iranian exports to drop by around 1 million barrels per day. U.S. bank Jefferies said there was enough oil to meet demand, but “global spare capacity is dwindling to the lowest level that we can document.” S&P Global Platts sees prices strengthening “a little” toward the end of the year, said Chris Midgely, the company’s global director of analytics, at the S&P Global Platts Analytics annual summit.  Fundamentals indicate a price in the high $70s for Brent, but the reality is seen above that, he said. Prices are then likely to weaken in the first two quarters of 2019 before strengthening about $4 to $5 a barrel in the second half of the year as the market anticipates a shipping fuel regulation that takes effect in 2020.  U.S. drillers cut two oil rigs in the week to Oct. 5, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said RIG-OL-USA-BHI.

2018-10-05,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. transportation sector, which many see as a proxy indicator of the economy’s health, has retreated 3.1 percent from its Sept. 14 record, hinting to some analysts that the longest bull market on record has entered its late stages. Railways, freight carriers and package deliverers get less attention than heavy-hitting momentum stocks like Apple Inc and Amazon.com, but the sector could be showing cracks in what analysts and the U.S. Federal Reserve characterize as a robust economy.  Several constituents of the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJT) have provided disappointing guidance in recent months. As the third-quarter reporting season approaches, investors will watch to gauge whether trade, fuel and dollar risks are affecting the sector’s bottom line.  The 20-company DJT has recently diverged from the broader market after a strong run since late June, suggesting these headwinds could be taking a toll. As the DJT has retreated, the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved in the opposite direction. The Dow reached its most recent all-time high on Tuesday, 13 trading days after the DJT’s Sept. 14 record. Diverging highs between the two indexes can signal growing market instability. Similar divergences occurred leading into the recessions of 2001 and 2008-2009, and most recently heading into the market correction that began in late January.  “The transports have been going sideways and haven’t confirmed the new highs in the industrials,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. “If the transports were to break down further from these levels, if you saw them declining another 2 or 3 percent in the near future, you would call that a bearish non-confirmation.”  On Friday, both indexes closed lower, with the DJT slipping 0.8 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 0.7 percent.  Delta Air Lines Inc is due to report on Oct. 9, a week after lackluster forecasts from the company and its peer United Continental pulled U.S. airline stocks lower. The bulk of the companies in the DJT are expected to post results in the latter half of October. FedEx Corp, the first in the group to post quarterly earnings on Sept. 17, missed Wall Street estimates as costs weighed on margins. The global package delivery company has been challenged this year by the ongoing trade disputes between the United States and its major bilateral trading partners, notably China and Europe. Although a preliminary deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement has boosted railway stocks, looming tariffs threaten to increase the cost of transporting goods and services, further testing other DJT constituents. “There may well be blood in the water before we actually get some kind of agreement on trade between the US and China,” said Bernard Baumohl,  managing director and chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, New Jersey. “It could do some serious damage in the long run as China seeks to establish new supply chain routes from other countries and rely less on the United States.”  Analysts see costs of transportation fuels, which include gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, continuing to climb due to tightening supply and increasing demand. Rising fuel costs are “depressing stocks that make up the transportation index,” Baumohl added. Brent Crude prices have risen nearly 26 percent since the beginning up the year and energy analysts see the trend continuing well into 2019.  “In the near-term we’ve seen prices increase as a result of Iranian sanctions reducing the supply of crude oil to the market,” said Andrew Lipow, consultant at Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. “I expect that over the next year, the price in transportation fuel is going to be increasing.” The climbing dollar could also pressure transportation companies as U.S. goods grow less affordable to foreign consumers, which might result in fewer shipments abroad.  The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major world currencies, has risen almost 4 percent so far this year.  “The net effect is that (the strong dollar) could impact the transportation index over the course of the next 12 months,” Baumohl said. Meanwhile, investors will get a clearer picture in coming weeks of the extent to which trade jitters, fuel costs and the rising dollar may have turned transports into a warning sign.        “There are a lot of wild cards out there now,” said Baumohl.

2018-10-05,"(Adds resolution at end of congress, spokesman’s quote) By Aaron Maasho HAWASSA, Ethiopia Oct 5 (Reuters) - Ethiopia’s ruling coalition on Friday extended the chairmanship of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, further anchoring his authority as he pushes through sweeping political and economic reforms. Abiy, 42, took power in April after his predecessor resigned following three years of unrest. He will now lead the ruling EPRDF coalition until the next congress, which usually takes place every two to three years. His re-election, by secret ballot at the end of the coalition’s three-day meeting, had been expected. He won 176 votes out of 177, according to a tally announced by Attorney General Berhanu Tsegaye, who is also a member of the coalition. The congress also re-elected Demeke Mekonnen as Abiy’s deputy. After the results were announced, delegates - many of them sporting scarves and shirts emblazoned with ruling party slogans - gave Abiy a round of applause. Six months ago, the former army officer took the helm of the once Marxist-Leninist EPRDF at a moment of crisis for the coalition that had ruled Ethiopia with an iron fist since toppling a military regime and taking power in 1991. The changes that he has presided over include making peace with arch-foe Eritrea, freeing political prisoners, pledging to open up the state-controlled economy and promising to overhaul the security services. But there has also been a surge in violence along ethnic lines since he came to power. At the conclusion of the congress on Friday, the coalition adopted a seven-point resolution that included pledges to safeguard reforms and strengthen multiparty democracy. It said the right of citizens to settle in any region should be defended, in the wake of mob attacks on minorities that have displaced hundreds of thousands of people in several provinces. The resolution said questions over identity and regional borders “should be resolved peacefully”. Congress spokesman Fekadu Tessema told a news conference that changes would also be made to government institutions. “We have laid the groundwork that will enable the implementation of reforms in the justice, security and intelligence sectors,” he said.

2018-10-05,"(Adds rigs in Permian basin in paragraph 6) By Scott DiSavino Oct 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. oil drilling rig count fell for a third consecutive week even though crude prices hit four-year highs this week, as rising costs and pipeline bottlenecks in the nation’s largest oil field have hindered new drilling since June. Drillers cut two oil rigs in the week to Oct. 5, bringing the total count down to 861, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI This is the longest streak of weekly cuts since October last year. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 748 rigs were active when energy companies ramped up production amid higher prices. Since June, however, the number of rigs has stalled in the 860s. The west Texas drillers that drove the shale revolution in the Permian basin have overwhelmed the region’s infrastructure with oil production - driving up costs, depressing regional oil prices WTM- WTC-WTM and slowing the pace of growth. More than half the total U.S. oil rigs are in the Permian, the country’s biggest shale oil formation. Active units there declined by one this week to 485. U.S. crude futures this week rose to their highest since late 2014 ahead of planned U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil in November. West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the U.S. benchmark, was trading near $75 per barrel on Friday, putting the contract on track to rise for a fourth week in a row for the first time since January. So far this year, WTI has averaged $67.01, up from averages of $50.85 in calendar 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading under $75 per barrel for the balance of 2018 and near $74 for calendar 2019. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided guidance indicating an 18 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks expect to spend a total of $85.3 billion in 2018. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Since 1,052 oil and gas rigs were already in service, drillers would only have to add a handful of rigs during the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. Year-to-date, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,020. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-10-05,"Oct 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. oil drilling rig count fell for a third consecutive week even though crude prices hit four-year highs this week, as rising costs and pipeline bottlenecks in the nation’s largest oil field have hindered new drilling since June. Drillers cut two oil rigs in the week to Oct. 5, bringing the total count down to 861, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI This is the longest streak of weekly cuts since October last year. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 748 rigs were active when energy companies ramped up production amid higher prices. Since June, however, the number of rigs has stalled in the 860s. The west Texas drillers that drove the shale revolution in the Permian basin have overwhelmed the region’s infrastructure with oil production - driving up costs, depressing regional oil prices WTM- WTC-WTM and slowing the pace of growth. The Permian is the biggest shale oil formation in the United States. U.S. crude futures this week rose to their highest since late 2014 ahead of planned U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil in November.

2018-10-05,"PRESTON, England (Reuters) - Shale gas developer Cuadrilla Resources expects to start gas fracking in northwest England next week, seven years after its first attempt to hydraulically fracture a well led to earth tremors, public protests and an overhaul of regulations. The process, behind a surge in U.S. gas production, involves fracturing rock deep under ground using a mixture of water, sand and chemicals to encourage the flow of hydrocarbons from shale, a dense and tightly-packed sedimentary rock. It has draw criticism from the public and campaigners concerned about the environmental impact of fracking and the pollution caused by fossil fuels. Protests against the practice led to work at Cuadrilla’s site being halted in 2011. But the government, keen to cut Britain’s reliance on gas imports which soared to more than 50 percent of gas supplies, has tightened regulations and earlier this year gave consent for Cuadrilla to go ahead again. Cuadrilla Chief Executive Francis Egan told Reuters that fracking of two wells and associated work would test gas flows. “From that we’ll be able to make an assessment of how much gas is recoverable and whether it will be commercially viable to develop the site,” he said on the muddy Preston New Road site. The industry’s future in Europe may hinge on the outcome. Although fracking has grown rapidly in the United States, it has not been proved viable in Europe despite several attempts, including projects that failed in Poland five years ago. Fracking has been banned in France, Germany and several other European countries. Cuadrilla’s well will be the first fracked horizontal well in Britain and the results will be watched by shale explorers such as IGas (IGAS.L), Egdon (EGRE.L) and Third Energy, as well as majors like Exxon (XOM.N) which was unsuccessful in Poland. The plans could also be delayed by an injunction hearing due on Oct. 10. Environment group Friends of the Earth said the injunction was sought by Bob Dennett, a resident in Lancashire, the English county where the project located. The hearing “will decide whether the injunction is upheld or whether fracking can commence whilst there is an outstanding judicial review over emergency planning procedures at the site,” Friends of the Earth said in a statement. Egan said this was a “last ditch, desperate attempt to slow us down” and said: “We think we have a very strong case to have that rejected and we will be in court next week arguing that.” The British Geological Survey estimates shale gas resources in northern England alone could amount to 1,300 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas, 10 percent of which could meet the country’s demand for almost 40 years. Britain has just 6.5 tcf in proved reserves and last year pumped 1.5 tcf, according to the BP Statistics Review. Proved reserves are the strictest calculation of oil and gas that can be commercially extracted. They change as discoveries are made. Cuadrilla, owned by Australian mining servicing company AJ Lucas (AJL.AX) and U.S. private equity fund Riverstone, said resource estimates were about 330 tcf for its licence area. Cuadrilla’s aimed to test a consultancy estimate that a single 2.5 km (1.25 mile) well would produce 6 billion cubic feet (bcm) of gas over its lifetime or about 5 million cubic feet a day, Egan said. If the tests are positive, Cuadrilla has permission for two more wells at the site located next to a road connecting the northern English towns of Preston and Blackpool.  Cuadrilla has enough funds for the current tests. Its shareholder Riverstone, a $38 billion private equity fund, has invested in U.S. shale firms such as pipeline operator Kinder Morgan.

2018-10-05,"* Russia-India pact is not a binding contract yet * Two Russian reactors already in operation in India * Two more reactors being built, two under negotiation * Deal could lead to 12 Russian reactors in India (Adds Rosatom statement, comment, detail) By Sanjeev Miglani and Geert De Clercq NEW DELHI/PARIS, Oct 5 (Reuters) - India and Russia on Friday signed a pact to build six more nuclear reactors at a new site in India following summit talks between their leaders in New Delhi. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also agreed to cooperate on India’s plan for a manned space mission. Russian state-owned reactor manufacturer Rosatom said in a statement that the two countries want to build six Russian-design nuclear reactors on a new site in India, boost nuclear cooperation in third countries and new nuclear technologies and are considering building nuclear plants together. The firm said Russia would offer to build its third-generation VVER reactor on the new site and would increase the level of participation of Indian companies in the project. A Rosatom official told Reuters the pact is not a firm contract yet, but an agreement to work towards a contract. India has not chosen the new site yet, which could be controversial as the country has seen vehement protests against new nuclear sites. If confirmed, the agreement would be one of the biggest nuclear industry deals in recent years, and would bind the two countries for decades. Two Russian-built VVER-1000 reactors have been in commercial operation in Kudankulam, southern India, since 2014 and 2017 respectively. Construction on two more started last year with a target for commercial start-up in 2025 and 2026. Last year, the Russian and Indian governments signed an agreement to build reactors 5 and 6 on the site and Putin said at the time that Russia is ready to build a dozen reactors in India over the next 20 years. reut.rs/2ye94Zi “We expect to start building a series of new units at a second site in India in the near future,” Rosatom Director-General Alexey Likhachev said in a statement. Rosatom has become the world's largest nuclear reactor builder as the financial problems of the two big Western firms Westinghouse Areva have crimped their ability to develop nuclear plants abroad. reut.rs/2NnEaDf Rosatom operates 35 reactors in Russia with a combined capacity of 28 gigawatt and says it has a portfolio of 36 nuclear power plant projects in 12 countries. Westinghouse and Areva, now owned by EDF, have for years negotiated deals to build reactors in India but have made little progress, partly because Indian nuclear liability legislation gives reactor manufacturers less protection against claims for damages in case of accidents.

The increase in non-farm payrolls slowed in September, likely from Hurricane Florence’s impact on restaurant and retail payrolls, but the U.S. Labor Department report also showed a rise in wages that could keep the Federal Reserve on track for more interest rate hikes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 131.7 points, or 0.49 percent, to 26,495.78, the S&P 500 lost 5.49 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,896.12 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 43.12 points, or 0.55 percent, to 7,836.40. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.73 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.00 percent. A steep sell-off in Treasury bonds that started midweek and pushed 10-year yields to seven-year highs has weighed on stocks and rippled through bond markets globally. “This week has been a bit of a bloodbath on the fixed income side of things,” said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at Oanda in Toronto. “I think the market moves in the bonds this week sideswiped a lot of individuals.” The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond reached a four-year high of 3.396 percent, up 4.5 basis points from late Thursday. The benchmark 10-year yield rose to 3.233 percent, up 3.8 basis points from late Thursday, but it had retraced some of those gains by 11 a.m. ET The U.S. bond market will be closed on Monday for the Columbus Day holiday, though stock markets will open.

The Japanese yen strengthened 0.16 percent versus the greenback at 113.73 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3087, up 0.53 percent on the day. Fears about Italy’s finances pushed Milan stocks down more than 1 percent, while London’s FTSE, Frankfurt’s DAX and the CAC in Paris were off 1.1 to 0.95 percent. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 44 cents to $74.77 a barrel by 10:46 a.m. EDT (1446 GMT). It was on track for a weekly gain of about 2 percent. Brent crude futures lost 9 cents to $84.49 a barrel. The contract was on course for a rise of around 2 percent for the week. “Iranian exports could fall below 1 million barrels per day in November,” U.S. bank Jefferies said, referring to looming U.S. sanctions on Tehran. The bank said there was enough oil to meet demand, but “global spare capacity is dwindling to the lowest level that we can document... meaning any further supply disruptions would be difficult for the market to manage - and could lead to spiking crude oil prices.” The combination of rising oil prices, borrowing costs and a climbing dollar have also been rocking emerging markets, which tend to be vulnerable to all three.

2018-10-05,"(Adds the number of companies that commented, paragraphs 4-5) By Nichola Groom, Timothy Gardner and Scott DiSavino LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Oct 5 (Reuters) - The Trump administration’s replacement of Obama-era carbon regulations will not save U.S. coal-fired power plants from shutdown, according to a Reuters survey of utilities, spelling bad news for Trump’s efforts to revive the ailing coal industry. The Environmental Protection Agency in August proposed replacing the Clean Power Plan, a signature climate change policy of the Obama administration aimed at curbing carbon emissions from the power industry. Instead, a weaker plan called the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, or ACE, would let states write their own rules. It marks the Trump administration’s most aggressive effort to help coal companies stung by falling demand from power plants. A Reuters survey of 44 utilities that have announced plans to shutter coal units in coming years showed none of them currently expects the new EPA proposal will affect the timing of those retirements. The survey showed 24 operators believe the proposal will have no impact, four believe it is too early to say if it will have an impact, seven declined to comment, and the rest did not respond. Together, the 35 operators that responded account for more than three-quarters of the nearly 150 coal-fired units scheduled for retirement in the United States in the coming decade. The responses suggest that a years-long shift away from coal – driven primarily by competition from cheap and abundant natural gas, the rise of renewable energy sources and anti-pollution rules – will likely continue on the basis of economics and not regulation. U.S. coal-fired power generation has fallen more than 40 percent since a peak in 2007, while natural gas-fired generation soared by about the same amount, according to the Energy Information Administration. The changes triggered mass layoffs and bankruptcies in America’s coal sector. Utilities’ demand for U.S. coal is projected to fall further this year, by around 2.5 percent to 648.2 million short tons, the lowest in 35 years, according to the EIA. Trump has vowed to help the coal industry by rolling back environmental regulation. But the EPA said its proposal was not specifically intended to bail out the coal industry. “Unlike the last administration, we are not using this authority to either advantage or disadvantage particular types of technologies,” the EPA said in an emailed statement provided by spokesman Michael Abboud. The National Mining Association, which represents the U.S. coal industry, said it hoped the rule would help the coal sector, arguing that premature coal plant retirements could raise consumer costs by tightening electricity markets. “While I can’t predict what plant owners will do, one would hope that they would consider the impact of any decision on the average American,” said NMA spokeswoman Ashley Burke. Shortly after the EPA unveiled its proposal, U.S. power plant operator NiSource Inc announced in September that it may accelerate the retirement of its coal plants instead of delaying them. “Technology and market changes continue to transform the energy industry, opening more competitive options and it’s the primary driver of the changes being considered for our system,” said Violet Sistovaris, president of NiSource’s NIPSCO division. Other utilities pushing ahead with retirements cited customer preferences for cleaner fuel sources as well as state climate policies and other federal regulations. Oklahoma utility OGE, for instance, is converting two units at its Muskogee plant in eastern Oklahoma to natural gas to comply with the federal Regional Haze Rule by 2019. “We have a legal deadline to comply with Regional Haze which leaves us no time to do anything than move forward with the conversion,” said spokesman Brian Alford. NRG, one of the largest U.S. power companies, said customer demand was a driver. “The energy industry is reducing its carbon footprint based on economics and customer demand. NRG is part of this momentum,” said spokesman David Knox. FirstEnergy Solutions, which has lobbied the Trump administration to take emergency measures to subsidize coal plants, did not comment on the ACE plan. But the company confirmed it has told a regional grid operator it still plans to shut 12 units at three plants in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania from 2019 to 2022. Three utilities – AEP, OPPD and PPL – were less certain about the impact of ACE, noting that the proposal gives states regulatory power. If implemented, states would get three years to submit their plans to the EPA, which has said it expects the rule to be finalized early next year. Duke Energy, which boasts 7 million electricity customers in six states, agreed that the states are a wild card, but said the timeline is too long for it to change course now. “Based on what we know right now, we do not have any plants whose future would be affected by the adoption of the ACE rule,” said spokeswoman Shannon Brushe.

2018-10-05,"* Government fuel price curbs hits state-run oil firm shares * Private fuel station operators also expected to be hit * Profits of oil marketers likely to be squeezed - analysts (Adds quotes, further details, background) By Promit Mukherjee and Sudarshan Varadhan MUMBAI, Oct 5 (Reuters) - India’s decision this week to cut petrol and diesel pump prices that had reached record highs sent oil company shares tumbling on Friday on concerns about a return to the kind of regulated regime that had hammered their profits in the past. The government said on Thursday it was cutting gasoline and diesel by 2.50 rupees per litre to help Indians struggling to pay for fuel prices that had climbed on the back of a rise in global crude prices and a weakening rupee. The move reversed a 2014 decision to scrap regulated fuel prices, a regime that was blamed for deterring state oil marketing firms from expanding and for choking off investment in domestic oil fields by India’s biggest oil producer. “This puts the entire deregulation policy of 2014 on shaky grounds,” said Gagan Dixit, a senior analyst with international brokerage firm Elara Capital, although he said any further intervention was unlikely for at least two weeks. The price cut reduced the government’s excise duty by 1.50 per litre and cut one rupee per litre on the amount charged by state-run oil marketing firms Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Shares in oil marketing companies fell more than 20 percent to multi-year lows on Friday before recovering marginally. This “risks bringing back petrol and diesel under-recoveries like before deregulation in 2014,” Jefferies said in report, adding that oil marketing companies were likely to see roughly a third of their operating profit eroded by the government move. Traders cited concerns that the government could make the companies absorb further rises in global crude prices rise or carry the cost of any additional weakening in the rupee. Since the beginning of the year the rupee has fallen by 14 percent, while the price of crude oil has risen by 37.4 percent. A government spokesman could not be reached for comment. The three state-owned oil marketing companies did not respond to emails seeking comment. Shares in Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), India’s biggest crude oil producer, also slid 15 percent. The state’s most profitable company in India had to absorb losses under the former price regime to keep the oil marketing firms afloat. The broader Mumbai market slid by 3.2 percent. After Thursday’s decision, ratings agency ICRA said in a report that oil marketing firms were likely to lose 72 billion rupees ($976 million) on fuel sales this fiscal year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi freed up the price of diesel in October 2014 after a decade or regulation, saying it would encourage competition among vehicle fuel retailers and enhance efficiency in oil company services. Experts had said it was one of his most far reaching reforms after previous governments failed to free the price of diesel, India’s most widely used transport fuel. Petrol prices were freed up by the former government of the Congress party in 2010. Any shift back to fuel price controls was also expected to hit private fuel marketers, such as Nayara Energy, which is owned by Russian oil giant Rosneft, and Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries. Nayara, Reliance and smaller private rival Shell together own around 6,000 fuel retail outlets, compared to the 55,000 outlets operated by state firms. The three private firms had shut fuel stations in 2008 when they could not compete with what was then highly subsided petrol and diesel prices. Asked how Nayara would respond to the latest government move, a company spokesman said: “Our fuel prices will be in line with industry standards.” Australia-based brokerage Macquarie Capital said it expected Reliance to gradually mothball its retail stations again. Reliance did not respond to an email requesting comment. Shell could not immediately be reached for comment. $1 = 73.7650 Indian rupees

2018-10-05,"CHERNOBYL, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine unveiled a solar plant in Chernobyl on Friday, just across from where a power station, now encased in a giant sarcophagus, caused the world’s worst nuclear disaster three decades ago. Built in a contaminated area, which remains largely uninhabitable and where visitors are accompanied by guides carrying radiation meters, 3,800 panels produce energy to power 2,000 apartments.  In April 1986, a botched test at reactor number 4 at the Soviet plant sent clouds of nuclear material billowing across Europe and forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate. Thirty-one plant workers and firemen died in the immediate aftermath of the accident, mostly from acute radiation sickness. Thousands more later succumbed to radiation-related illnesses such as cancer, although the total death toll and long-term health effects remain a subject of intense debate.  “It’s not just another solar power plant,” Evhen Variagin, the chief executive of Solar Chernobyl LLC, told reporters.   “It’s really hard to underestimate the symbolism of this particular project.” The one-megawatt solar plant is a joint project by Ukrainian company Rodina and Germany’s Enerparc AG, costing around 1 million euros ($1.2 million) and benefiting from feed-in tariffs that guarantee a certain price for power.  It is the first time the site has produced power since 2000, when the nuclear plant was finally shut down. Valery Seyda, head of the Chernobyl nuclear plant, said it had looked like the site would never produce energy again.  “But now we are seeing a new sprout, still small, weak, producing power on this site and this is very joyful,” he said. Two years ago, a giant arch weighing 36,000 tonnes was pulled over the nuclear power station to create a casement to block radiation and allow the remains of the reactor to be dismantled safely. It comes at a time of sharply increasing investment in renewables in Ukraine. Between January and September, more than 500 MW of renewable power capacity was added in the country, more than twice as much as in 2017, the government says.  Yulia Kovaliv, who heads the Office of the National Investment Council of Ukraine, said investors want to reap the benefits from a generous subsidy scheme before parliament is due to vote on scrapping it in July next year.  “Investors expect that in the renewable energy sector facilities launched before 2019 will operate on the current (beneficial) system of green tariffs,” she told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Odessa in September.  “And that is why investors want to buy ready-to-build projects in order to complete construction before that time.”  Additional reporting by Natalia Zinets in Odessa; writing by Matthias Williams; Editing by Dale Hudson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/ukraine-chernobyl-solar/three-decades-after-nuclear-disaster-chernobyl-goes-solar-idUKL8N1WL27I,05 Oct 2018,"Ukraine unveiled a

2018-10-05,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain took measures on Friday aimed at reducing electricity bills which are among the highest in Europe and are often criticized for reducing business competitiveness and consumer’s purchasing power. The government will scrap a controversial levy on solar power affecting households and small businesses, Energy and Environment Minister Teresa Ribera said, making it easier for consumers to erect panels for their own use.  “This country is finally freeing itself from the great absurdity, scorned by most international observers, that is the ‘sun tax’,” Ribera told a news conference.  “A key figure showing Spain’s delay in this area is that a country so rich in sunlight has only 1,000 installations of this kind compared with more than one million in Germany,” she added.  The toll applied to a system known as “auto-consumption”, using installations with more than 10 kilowatts of capacity that were connected to the national grid. Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez brought environment and energy together into a ministry when he toppled his conservative predecessor in June, to underline his government’s commitment to environmental sustainability. Spanish consumers pay the sixth-highest electricity prices in the European Union, according to Eurostat.  In the throes of an economic crisis in 2013, the previous conservative government cut subsidies for renewable energy in a bid to tackle a 28 billion euro ($32 billion) debt, known as a tariff deficit, built up by years of regulation which kept prices below costs.      Included in the reform was the ‘sun tax’, which put consumers off taking advantage of a plunge in the price of solar panels that has made them an attractive energy source in other countries.  Friday’s changes, contained in a decree law, also included suspending for six months a 7 percent levy on power generation which utilities had mainly passed on to consumers.  Along with the suspension of a levy on hydrocarbon use for electricity production, this should cut average household bills by around 4 percent, Ribera said, adding, “It is a relief measure, which will give us six months to work on big structural measures.” With only a quarter of parliamentary seats, Sanchez has little room to implement deep policy changes, and has favored high-profile measures aimed at appealing to left-wing voters.

2018-10-05,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s Environment Ministry will try to overcome resistance from carmakers to fitting older diesel cars with expensive new exhaust filtering systems as politicians and carmakers scramble to avoid outright bans on vehicles. German carmakers and politicians were forced to hash out a compromise deal to cut pollution this week after environmental groups won a key victory in February which allowed cities to ban older diesel cars. Carmakers are now scrambling to avert bans while seeking to avoid costly re-engineering of old cars as a way to cut nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate pollution levels in cities. Volkswagen on Friday reiterated it would back retrofits — as the hardware fixes are known — and offer to shoulder 80 percent of the costs, but only on the condition that other carmakers would do the same. BMW (BMWG.DE) and Peugeot (PEUP.PA) have said they don’t see them as a viable solution.  “That statement refers to the early reactions of BMW or the VDA (automotive industry association). That cannot be the end of it,” the environment ministry spokesman said in a regular government news conference. The issue is an urgent one. Authorities in Berlin are looking at imposing bans on older diesel cars on 20 streets including major routes in the German capital, local broadcaster rbb said on Friday. A ban is due to take effect in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital, from February. The city of Hamburg this year voluntarily blocked diesel models that fail to meet the Euro-6 emissions standard from selected trunk roads. BMW said on Tuesday it did not see hardware retrofits for diesel vehicles as a sensible way for cities to quickly meet European Union clean air rules.  The time it takes to get new exhaust filters certified for roadworthiness means retrofits take longer to implement than immediate trade-in incentives which allow clients to buy lower polluting cars, BMW said. Carlos Tavares, the chief executive of France’s PSA Group said the retrofit approach “doesn’t work” because carmakers would balk at having to make a financial contribution towards rebuilding older cars. “Who’s going to pay is not clear. We believe it’s not the carmakers’ responsibility because at the time when those cars were sold, they met all legal requirements,” Carlos Tavares told Reuters at the Paris Motor Show. BMW said it would offer a trade-in incentive of 6,000 euros in the most polluted parts of the country.

2018-10-05,"DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - German utility RWE (RWEG.DE) on Friday said a court ruling which delays its ability to mine brown coal in Hambach, Germany will result in a more than 100 million euro fall in operating profit for its Lignite & Nuclear division in 2019. A German court told RWE (RWEG.DE) that it could not start logging in an ancient forest until a separate court had reviewed environmental claims, potentially delaying the start of lignite mining in the area until after 2020. “As a result, as of 2019, the earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of the segment Lignite & Nuclear will be negatively affected in the range of a low three digit million euro amount per year,” RWE said on Friday. The utility giant, one of Europe’s largest carbon dioxide emitters, has drawn heavy criticism from environmentalists over the planned clearing of the Hambach forest that it bought decades ago to expand mining in the area, located in North Rhine-Westphalia. Germany aims to raise wind and solar power’s share of energy generation from a third now to 65 percent by 2030 to help to cut carbon dioxide emissions and achieve its climate commitments, as Europe’s largest economy works on ways to phase out its coal-fired power plants. RWE has said it would lose as much as 5 billion euros  ($5.75 billion) if it could not continue to mine lignite by removing the last bit of the ancient Hambach forest.. The administrative state court in Muenster said that RWE could continue to mine lignite as long as it does not use forested areas in Hambach. But it said RWE may not start logging until a separate court in Cologne has ruled on environmental group BUND’s suit against the company’s plans for the mine. The case entails several hundred pages of correspondence and dozens of boxes of documents, which means it will take some time to decide, the Muenster court said in its statement, adding that RWE had failed to make its case that it was necessary to start logging quickly. RWE had planned to start clearing the forest in mid-October, but a spokeswoman for the Cologne court said a decision was unlikely within a few weeks. A spokesman for BUND told Reuters that he did not expect a decision until at least April of next year. Controversy over the project came to a head in September, when riot police cleared environmental activists from treehouses in the forest, dismantling a protest camp set up five years ago to block a coal mining project. RWE had no immediate comment on the court ruling. In January, in its core markets Germany, Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands, RWE operated nearly 19 gigawatt of hard coal- and lignite-fired power plants, about 47 percent of its total generation capacity. Shares in RWE fell as much as 4.7 percent to 19.48 euros on Friday, reaching their lowest level since early July. Germany’s blue-chip DAX index was 0.8 percent lower.

2018-10-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - Plastics and other petrochemical products will drive global oil demand to 2050, offsetting slower consumption of motor fuel, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Friday. Despite government efforts to cut pollution and carbon emissions from oil and gas, the Paris-based agency said it expected the rapid growth of emerging economies, such as India and China, to propel demand for petrochemical products. Petrochemicals that are derived from oil and gas feedstocks form the building blocks for products that range from plastic bottles and beauty products to fertilisers and explosives. Oil demand for transport is expected to slow by 2050 due to the rise of electric vehicles and more-efficient combustion engines, but that would be offset by rising demand for petrochemicals, the IEA said in a report. “The petrochemical sector is one of the blind spots of the global energy debate and there is no question that it will be the key driver of oil demand growth for many years to come,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol told Reuters. Petrochemicals are expected to account for more than a third of global oil demand growth by 2030 and nearly half of demand growth by 2050, according to the world’s energy watchdog. Global demand for petrochemical feedstock accounted for 12 million barrels per day (bpd), or roughly 12 percent of total demand for oil in 2017. The figure is forecast to grow to almost 18 million bpd in 2050. Most demand growth will take place in the Middle East and China, where big petrochemical plants are being built. Oil companies such as Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell plan to invest in new petrochemical plants in the coming decades, betting on the rising demand for plastics in emerging economies. In the Middle East, major producers such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are also investing in large petrochemical plants because in some cases they can make more money by converting crude oil directly into plastics rather than oil products such as gasoline and diesel, Birol said. Plastics use has come under increased scrutiny as waste makes its way into the oceans where it harms marine life, prompting several countries to ban, partly ban or tax single-use plastic bags. But the IEA report said government efforts to encourage recycling in order to curb carbon emissions would have only a minor impact on petrochemical growth. “Although substantial increases in recycling and efforts to curb single-use plastics take place, especially led by Europe, Japan and Korea, these efforts will be far outweighed by the sharp increase in developing economies of plastic consumption,” it said. Under the IEA’s most aggressive scenario, recycling could hit around 5 percent of high-value chemical demand. Petrochemical plants mainly run on light oil products such as naphtha and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). But natural gas is becoming an increasingly favored feedstock, particularly in the United States where shale gas production has risen. The report said petrochemical projects would account for 7 percent of the roughly 850 billion cubic meters in gas demand increase between 2017 and 2030, and 4 percent of the increase projected for 2050.

2018-10-05,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Authorities in Berlin are looking at imposing bans on older diesel cars on 20 streets including major routes in the German capital, local broadcaster rbb said on Friday. An administrative court in Berlin is due to hear a case brought against the city-state of Berlin by the DUH environmental group next Tuesday. DUH wants the city to reduce air pollution by banning diesel vehicles up to the Euro 4 standard from the end of 2018 and for Euro 5 standard cars from September 2019. The latest standard is Euro 6.  The rbb report cited internal documents on cleaner air from the Berlin Senate Administration for Environment, Transport and Climate Protection. It said those documents showed almost one in six drivers in Berlin would be affected. The department could not immediately be reached for comment. The federal German government this week outlined plans to cut pollution from diesel vehicles by asking carmakers to offer owners trade-in incentives and hardware fixes, prompting objections from environmental groups and grudging concessions from the industry. The German Environment Agency (UBA) does not think the measures agreed at the diesel summit will suffice to avoid driving bans in all German cities, magazine Der Spiegel reported on Friday. It said the UBA - Germany’s main environmental protection agency - was particularly skeptical about whether the trade-in incentives to get owners of older diesel cars to switch to newer, cleaner ones would be effective. Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) admission in 2015 that it cheated U.S. diesel emissions tests led to the discovery that diesel vehicles from several manufacturers routinely exceeded pollution limits in normal driving conditions, prompting a regulatory crackdown. Environmental groups have been encouraged by a court ruling in February that allowed cities to ban older diesel cars. A ban is due to take effect in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital, from February. The city of Hamburg this year voluntarily blocked diesel models that fail to meet the Euro-6 emissions standard from selected trunk roads.

The usual drop in activity ahead of the monthly non-farm payrolls couldn’t prevent Europe’s main bourses following Asia into the red - but it wasn’t the deep shade of crimson of the previous day. Lingering worries about Italy’s finances pushed Milan down 1 percent again, while London’s FTSE, Frankfurt’s DAX and the CAC in Paris were off 0.6-0.8 percent. Wall Street futures were also modestly weaker but it was the bond and currency markets where the attention was really trained. The dollar barely budged against its main sparring partners the euro and the Japanese yen after testing a 10-week high, but rising bond yields - which drive the global cost of borrowing - were causing a headache again. Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields were at a seven-year top of 3.2 percent on their way to their biggest weekly yield rise since February as European yields added to their biggest rise in months as well. And with talk of plenty more U.S. interest rate hikes growing louder, it put all the more focus on the U.S. jobs data later. Eaton Vance portfolio manager Justin Bourgette said though there was too much hype around the payrolls figures, whichever way you approach it, the U.S. labour market is currently super strong. The latest Reuters poll sees 185,000 new jobs pushing the unemployment rate to an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. Average hourly earnings are expected to increase 0.3 percent after leaping 0.4 percent in August. “Whatever the Fed’s concept of the neutral interest rate is, it must be rising,” Bourgette said. “And it is going to be trial and error to some degree (on how high rates go), because you just don’t know where the choking point is.” Tied in with the rise in borrowing costs has been the latest spike in oil prices, as energy costs tend to have an outsized impact on inflation which is what most major central banks focus on when setting interest rates. Brent crude futures nudged around $85 barrel, and U.S. crude went quiet at $74.5 a barrel. That kept both just under 4-year highs. They have also risen an staggering 15-20 percent since mid-August. “Iranian exports could fall below 1 million barrels per day in November,” U.S. bank Jefferies said, referring to looming U.S. sanctions on Tehran. The bank said there was enough oil to meet demand, but “global spare capacity is dwindling to the lowest level that we can document ... meaning any further supply disruptions would be difficult for the market to manage - and could lead to spiking crude oil prices”. The painful combination of rising oil prices, borrowing costs and a climbing dollar have also been rocking emerging markets which tend to be vulnerable to all three. MSCI’s 24-country emerging market equity index was down 0.7 percent and headed for its worst week since February and plenty of currencies were carrying heavy losses too. The Indian rupee fell to new record low after the central bank kept its interest rates on hold despite clear inflation places. The rupee has been hammered by higher oil prices, and is the worst performer in Asia this year. Indian stocks also fell for a third straight session, dragged down by energy firms, a day after the government announced a cut in fuel prices. That cut sparked fears of the country going back towards the regulated regime where the prices of diesel and petrol were controlled by the government. Petrol prices were regulated until 2012, while diesel prices remained so until 2014. A new Reuters poll also pointed to more pain for this year’s worst performing currency, the Argentine peso. It showed analysts think it could fall almost 20 over the next year, doubtful about the government’s ability to tame inflation. “In general, what’s driving emerging market weakness is a stronger U.S. economy ... there is a lack of clarity on the effectiveness of rate hikes as a currency defence,” said Sunil Sharma, chief investment officer with Sanctum Wealth Management.

2018-10-05,"LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration’s replacement of Obama-era carbon regulations will not save U.S. coal-fired power plants from shutdown, according to a Reuters survey of utilities, spelling bad news for Trump’s efforts to revive the ailing coal industry. The Environmental Protection Agency in August proposed replacing the Clean Power Plan, a signature climate change policy of the Obama administration aimed at curbing carbon emissions from the power industry. Instead, a weaker plan called the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, or ACE, would let states write their own rules.  It marks the Trump administration’s most aggressive effort to help coal companies stung by falling demand from power plants. A Reuters survey of 44 utilities that have announced plans to shutter coal units in coming years showed none of them currently expects the new EPA proposal will affect the timing of those retirements. The survey showed 24 operators believe the proposal will have no impact, four believe it is too early to say if it will have an impact, seven declined to comment, and the rest did not respond. Together, the 35 operators that responded account for more than three-quarters of the nearly 150 coal-fired units scheduled for retirement in the United States in the coming decade.  The responses suggest that a years-long shift away from coal – driven primarily by competition from cheap and abundant natural gas, the rise of renewable energy sources and anti-pollution rules – will likely continue on the basis of economics and not regulation. U.S. coal-fired power generation has fallen more than 40 percent since a peak in 2007, while natural gas-fired generation soared by about the same amount, according to the Energy Information Administration. The changes triggered mass layoffs and bankruptcies in America’s coal sector.  Utilities’ demand for U.S. coal is projected to fall further this year, by around 2.5 percent to 648.2 million short tons, the lowest in 35 years, according to the EIA. Trump has vowed to help the coal industry by rolling back environmental regulation. But the EPA said its proposal was not specifically intended to bail out the coal industry. “Unlike the last administration, we are not using this authority to either advantage or disadvantage particular types of technologies,” the EPA said in an emailed statement provided by spokesman Michael Abboud. The National Mining Association, which represents the U.S. coal industry, said it hoped the rule would help the coal sector, arguing that premature coal plant retirements could raise consumer costs by tightening electricity markets.  “While I can’t predict what plant owners will do, one would hope that they would consider the impact of any decision on the average American,” said NMA spokeswoman Ashley Burke. Shortly after the EPA unveiled its proposal, U.S. power plant operator NiSource Inc announced in September that it may accelerate the retirement of its coal plants instead of delaying them. “Technology and market changes continue to transform the energy industry, opening more competitive options and it’s the primary driver of the changes being considered for our system,” said Violet Sistovaris, president of NiSource’s NIPSCO division. Other utilities pushing ahead with retirements cited customer preferences for cleaner fuel sources as well as state climate policies and other federal regulations. Oklahoma utility OGE, for instance, is converting two units at its Muskogee plant in eastern Oklahoma to natural gas to comply with the federal Regional Haze Rule by 2019. “We have a legal deadline to comply with Regional Haze which leaves us no time to do anything than move forward with the conversion,” said spokesman Brian Alford.  NRG, one of the largest U.S. power companies, said customer demand was a driver. “The energy industry is reducing its carbon footprint based on economics and customer demand. NRG is part of this momentum,” said spokesman David Knox. FirstEnergy Solutions [FE.UL], which has lobbied the Trump administration to take emergency measures to subsidize coal plants, did not comment on the ACE plan. But the company confirmed it has told a regional grid operator it still plans to shut 12 units at three plants in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania from 2019 to 2022.          Three utilities – AEP, OPPD and PPL – were less certain about the impact of ACE, noting that the proposal gives states regulatory power. If implemented, states would get three years to submit their plans to the EPA, which has said it expects the rule to be finalized early next year.  Duke Energy, which boasts 7 million electricity  customers in six states, agreed that the states are a wild card, but said the timeline is too long for it to change course now. “Based on what we know right now, we do not have any plants whose future would be affected by the adoption of the ACE rule,” said spokeswoman Shannon Brushe.

2018-10-05,"NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. transportation sector, which many see as a proxy indicator of the economy’s health, has retreated 2.3 percent from its Sept. 14 record, hinting to some analysts that the longest bull market on record has entered its late stages. Railways, freight carriers and package deliverers get less attention than heavy-hitting momentum stocks like Apple Inc and Amazon.com, but the sector could be showing cracks in what analysts and the U.S. Federal Reserve characterize as a robust economy. Several constituents of the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJT) have provided disappointing guidance in recent months. As the third-quarter reporting season approaches, investors will watch to gauge whether trade, fuel and dollar risks are affecting the sector’s bottom line. The 20-company DJT has recently diverged from the broader market after a strong run since late June, suggesting these headwinds could be taking a toll. As the DJT has retreated, the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved in the opposite direction. The Dow reached its most recent all-time high on Tuesday, 13 trading days after the DJT’s Sept. 14 record. Diverging highs between the two indexes can signal growing market instability. Similar divergences occurred leading into the recessions of 2001 and 2008-2009, and most recently heading into the market correction that began in late January. “The transports have been going sideways and haven’t confirmed the new highs in the industrials,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. “If the transports were to break down further from these levels, if you saw them declining another 2 or 3 percent in the near future, you would call that a bearish non-confirmation.” On Thursday, both indexes closed lower, with the DJT slipping 0.4 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 0.75 percent. Delta Air Lines Inc is due to report on Oct. 9, a week after a lackluster forecasts from the company and its peer United Continental pulled U.S. airline stocks lower . The bulk of the companies in the DJT are expected to post results in the latter half of October. FedEx Corp, the first in the group to post quarterly earnings on Sept. 17, missed Wall Street estimates as costs weighed on margins. The global package delivery company has been challenged this year by the ongoing trade disputes between the United States and its major bilateral trading partners, notably China and Europe. Although a preliminary deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has boosted railway stocks , looming tariffs threaten to increase the cost of transporting goods and services, further testing other DJT constituents. “There may well be blood in the water before we actually get some kind of agreement on trade between the US and China,” said Bernard Baumohl,  managing director and chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, New Jersey. “It could do some serious damage in the long run as China seeks to establish new supply chain routes from other countries and rely less on the United States.” Analysts see costs of transportation fuels, which include gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, continuing to climb due to tightening supply and increasing demand. Rising fuel costs are “depressing stocks that make up the transportation index,” Baumohl added. Brent Crude prices have risen nearly 27 percent since the beginning up the year and energy analysts see the trend continuing well into 2019. “In the near-term we’ve seen prices increase as a result of Iranian sanctions reducing the supply of crude oil to the market,” said Andrew Lipow, consultant at Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. “I expect that over the next year, the price in transportation fuel is going to be increasing.” The climbing dollar could also pressure transportation companies as American goods grow less affordable to foreign consumers, which might result in fewer shipments abroad. The dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of major world currencies, has risen almost 4 percent so far this year. “The net effect is that (the strong dollar) could impact the transportation index over the course of the next 12 months,” Baumohl said. Meanwhile, investors will get a clearer picture in coming weeks of the extent to which trade jitters, fuel costs and the rising dollar may have turned transports into a warning sign. “There are a lot of wild cards out there now,” said Baumohl.

2018-10-05,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) premium brand Audi on Friday said it expected sales in Europe to fluctuate in the coming months after a 55.5 percent slump in September sales due to supply bottlenecks caused by stricter anti-pollution rules. Last month VW Group’s sales fell by half in Europe’s five biggest markets, according to analysts at Citi, after several top selling models failed to conform to new the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test (WLTP) rules.  Audi’s monthly sales were down by 69.4 percent in Germany, while China deliveries increased 12.5 percent and sales in North America rose 1.2 percent, the carmaker said. “Following above-average sales results in Europe over the past two months due to the sell-off of models in stock, the increasingly empty stores and the restrictions in the sales portfolio had an adverse effect on deliveries in September,” Audi said. Some of the supply bottlenecks that have slowed sales of VW’s namesake brand, however, are now easing, VW said. “Currently we have WLTP certification for volume sellers for all of our 14 models,” it said in a statement.  “Further vehicle variants will gain their product release shortly,” VW said, adding that by year-end it would be able to offer close to all models to customers.

2018-10-05,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Authorities in Berlin are looking at imposing driving bans on older diesel cars on 20 streets including major routes in the German capital, local broadcaster rbb said on Friday. An administrative court in Berlin is due to hear a case brought against the city-state of Berlin by the DUH environmental group next Tuesday. DUH wants the city to reduce air pollution by banning diesel vehicles up to the Euro 4 standard from the end of 2018 and for Euro 5 standard cars from September 2019. The latest standard is Euro 6.  The rbb report cited internal documents on cleaner air from the Berlin Senate Administration for Environment, Transport and Climate Protection. It said those documents showed almost one in six drivers in Berlin would be affected. The department could not immediately be reached for comment. The federal German government this week outlined plans to cut pollution from diesel vehicles by asking carmakers to offer owners trade-in incentives and hardware fixes, prompting objections from environmental groups and grudging concessions from the industry. Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) admission in 2015 that it cheated U.S. diesel emissions tests led to the discovery that diesel vehicles from several manufacturers routinely exceeded pollution limits in normal driving conditions, prompting a regulatory crackdown. Environmental groups have been encouraged by a court ruling in February that allowed cities to ban older diesel cars. A ban is due to take effect in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital, from February. The city of Hamburg this year voluntarily blocked diesel models that fail to meet the Euro-6 emissions standard from selected trunk roads.

Plans to develop a 1,050-megawatt coal-fired plant on the coast, using funding from China, have been delayed by court action from environmental activists. The development of nuclear energy will come after other resources have been fully exploited in line with growing demand for energy, Njoroge said. “That is after we have done a lot of exploitation of the geothermal, the coal that we also want to exploit, the wind, solar and all those,” he said. “At that time the only option we will have to get clean energy will be from nuclear.” (Reporting by Duncan Miriri; Editing by Dale Hudson)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/kenya-electricity-nuclear/kenya-on-course-to-develop-nuclear-energy-official-says-idUKL8N1WL1HF,05 Oct 2018,"Kenya's ambition of having a

The usual drop in activity ahead of the monthly non-farm payrolls couldn’t prevent Europe’s main bourses following Asia into the red - but it wasn’t the deep shade of crimson of the previous day. Lingering worries about Italy’s finances pushed Milan down 0.9 percent, while London’s FTSE, Frankfurt’s DAX and the CAC in Paris were off 0.6-0.8 percent and Wall Street futures were modestly weaker. It was the bond and currency markets, though, where the attention was really trained. The dollar barely budged against its main sparring partners the euro and the Japanese yen after testing a 10-week high, but rising bond yields - which drive the global cost of borrowing - were causing a headache again. Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields were at a seven-year top and on their way to their biggest weekly yield rise since February while European yields were adding to their biggest rise in months as well. And with talk of plenty more U.S. interest rate hikes growing louder, it put all the more focus on the U.S. jobs data later. Eaton Vance portfolio manager Justin Bourgette said though there was too much hype around the payrolls figures, whichever way you approach it, the U.S. labour market is currently super strong. The latest Reuters poll sees 185,000 new jobs and average hourly earnings increasing 0.3 percent in September after leaping 0.4 percent in August. “Whatever the Fed’s concept of the neutral interest rate is, it must be rising,” Bourgette said. “And it is going to be trial and error to some degree (on how high rates go), because you just don’t know where the choking point is.” Tied in with the rise in borrowing costs has been the latest spike in oil prices, as energy costs tend to have an outsized impact on inflation which is what most major central banks focus on when setting interest rates. Brent crude futures gained 0.5 percent to $85.03 barrel, and U.S. crude rose 0.7 percent to $74.88 barrel. That kept both just under 4-year highs. They have also risen an staggering 15-20 percent since mid-August. “Iranian exports could fall below 1 million barrels per day in November,” U.S. bank Jefferies said, referring to looming U.S. sanctions on Tehran. The investment bank said there was enough oil to meet demand, but “global spare capacity is dwindling to the lowest level that we can document ... meaning any further supply disruptions would be difficult for the market to manage - and could lead to spiking crude oil prices”. The painful combination of rising oil prices, borrowing costs and a climbing dollar have also been rocking emerging markets which tend to be vulnerable to all three. MSCI’s 24-country emerging market equity index was down 0.7 percent and headed for its worst week since February and plenty of currencies were carrying heavy losses too. The Indian rupee fell to new record low after the central bank kept its interest rates on hold. The rupee has been hammered by higher oil prices, and is the worst performer in Asia this year. Indian stocks also fell for a third straight session, dragged down by energy firms, a day after the government announced a cut in fuel prices. That cut sparked fears of the country going back towards the regulated regime where the prices of diesel and petrol were controlled by the government. Petrol prices were regulated until 2012, while diesel prices remained so until 2014. “In general, what’s driving emerging market weakness is a stronger U.S. economy ... there is a lack of clarity on the effectiveness of rate hikes as a currency defence,” said Sunil Sharma, chief investment officer with Sanctum Wealth Management.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.6 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei average closed down 0.8 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped 0.1 percent. “Rapidly rising Treasury yields are rocking equity markets around the globe, with high price-to-earnings tech stocks leading the decline,” said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments. While most Asian shares are seen ending their session in the red, financial spreadbetters expect London’s FTSE to open 21 points higher, Frankfurt’s DAX to rise 3 points and Paris’s CAC to add 2 points. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note hit a fresh seven-year high of 3.232 percent overnight after figures out earlier were seen as increasing the odds Friday’s payrolls report would also be stronger than expected. Wall Street stocks fell broadly on Thursday, with the Dow suffering its first decline in six sessions and both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq seeing their worst day since June 25. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8 percent, while the S&P 500 lost 0.8 percent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.8 percent. The CBOE Global Markets volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, jumped as high as 15.84, its highest since Aug. 15. The Japanese equivalent of VIX also rose, with the Nikkei volatility index surging as high as 19.07, its highest in seven weeks. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier this week the economy can expand for “quite some time,” which also helped the yield curve steepen to its highest in two months. Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of Doubleline Capital, told Reuters on Thursday that the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield has broken above a multi-year base, which should lead to significantly higher in financial markets. “As I have been saying, two consecutive closes above 3.25 percent on the benchmark 30-year Treasury means that my statement in July 2016 that we were seeing the low - I said italicized, underlined and in boldface - is now, looking at the charts, thoroughly corroborated,” he said. On Thursday, the 30-year Treasury note closed at 3.35 percent, compared with 3.34 percent on Wednesday. The surge in Treasury yields has also prompted a rise in government bond yields across the globe, with a major exception being Italy, where borrowing costs dropped after the government said it would cut budget deficit targets from 2020. Japanese government bond yields eased slightly after hitting 2-1/2-year highs on Thursday, the highest levels since the Bank of Japan introduced negative rates in early 2016. The spread between junk bonds and long-end U.S. Treasuries shrank to the narrowest since 2007 on Wednesday as government debt was sold off heavily, with analysts closely watching to see if that could signal a imminent end to the credit cycle. The premium investors are paid, or the average spread, of U.S. corporate “junk” bond yields over Treasury debt, fell to 3.16 percentage points on Wednesday, the tightest since just before the financial crisis, according to the ICE BofAML U.S. High Yield Master II Option-Adjusted Spread The U.S. dollar was steady but lingered near recent highs against the euro and the yen as investors assessed U.S. economic data and Powell’s remarks. The dollar index was little changed at 95.787, with the euro softening 0.1 percent to $1.1509. The Japanese yen was flat versus the greenback at 113.93 per dollar. Investors are expected to scour the U.S. government’s September payroll report scheduled for release on Friday and look closely for signs of wage growth, especially in light of anecdotal indications of rising wages. “Although we are likely to see strong payroll figures later today, we could see some corrections in markets ahead of a long weekend in the United States and Japan,” said Naoki Iwami, fixed income chief investment officer at Whiz Partners. Oil prices rose on Friday, two days after hitting four-year highs, as traders anticipated a tighter market due to U.S. sanctions against Iran’s crude exports, which are set to start next month. U.S. crude oil futures rose 0.7 percent to $74.88 barrel and Brent crude futures gained 0.5 percent to $85.03 barrel.

2018-10-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - Plastics and other petrochemical products will drive global oil demand to 2050, offsetting slower consumption of motor fuel, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Friday. Despite government efforts to cut pollution and carbon emissions from oil and gas, the Paris-based agency said it expected the rapid growth of emerging economies, such as India and China, to propel demand for petrochemical products. Petrochemicals that are derived from oil and gas feedstocks form the building blocks for products that range from plastic bottles and beauty products to fertilisers and explosives. Oil demand for transport is expected to slow by 2050 due to the rise of electric vehicles and more efficient combustion engines, but that would be offset by rising demand for petrochemicals, the IEA said in a report. “The petrochemical sector is one of the blind spots of the global energy debate and there is no question that it will be the key driver of oil demand growth for many years to come,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol told Reuters. For a graphic on petrochemicals demand, click reut.rs/2OCZA3X Petrochemicals are expected to account for more than a third of global oil demand growth by 2030 and nearly half of demand growth by 2050, according to the world’s energy watchdog. Global demand for petrochemical feedstock accounted for 12 million barrels per day (bpd), or roughly 12 percent of total demand for oil in 2017. The figure is forecast to grow to almost 18 million bpd in 2050. Most demand growth will take place in the Middle East and China where big petrochemical plants are being built. Oil companies such as Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) plan to invest in new petrochemical plants in the coming decades, betting on the rising demand for plastics. For a graphic on share of total oil demand growth by sector, click reut.rs/2IBSpDM Plastics use has come under increased scrutiny as waste makes its way into the oceans where it harms marine life, prompting several countries to ban, partly ban or tax single use plastic bags. But the IEA report said government efforts to encourage recycling in order to curb carbon emissions would have only a minor impact on petrochemical growth. “Although substantial increases in recycling and efforts to curb single-use plastics take place, especially led by Europe, Japan and Korea, these efforts will be far outweighed by the sharp increase in developing economies of plastic consumption,” it said. Under the IEA’s most aggressive scenario, recycling could hit around 5 percent of high-value chemical demand. Petrochemical plants mainly run on light oil products such as naphtha and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). But natural gas is becoming an increasingly favoured feedstock, particularly in the United States where shale gas production has risen. The report said petrochemical projects would account for 7 percent of the roughly 850 billion cubic metres (bcm) in gas demand increase between 2017 and 2030, and 4 percent of the increase projected for 2050.

2018-10-05,"* Brent-indexed LNG curve: tmsnrt.rs/2BVQNDE By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Asian spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices eased slightly over the past week as healthy supplies going into the northern hemisphere’s autumn season countered upward pressure from a bullish oil market. Spot prices for November delivery LNG-AS dipped by 10 cents to $11 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), industry sources said. That slip came despite an extremely bullish crude oil market which has seen benchmark Brent futures surge by 20 percent since mid-August ahead of U.S. sanctions against Iran’s petroleum sector that kick in from Nov. 4. While a major oil exporter, Iran sells no LNG, and traders said Asian gas markets were well supplied. “Oil markets may be volatile and bullish at the moment. In LNG, things are a bit more quiet at this stage,” said a Singapore-based trader. “Sure, demand is strong ahead of the winter heating season across North Asia, but supply is also pretty decent,” he said, declining to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media. The well-supplied market is reflected in the price curve, in which Brent-indexed LNG prices show a slight rise over the coming peak winter months, but with the curve easing after that into the second-half of 2019. Japan’s Inpex said this week it shipped its first condensate export cargo from the Ichthys LNG project in Australia. Inpex said in August that it expected the $40 billion Ichthys project to start shipping condensate, LNG and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in that order from around end-September to end-December. LNG demand tends to rise in the second-half of a year as utilities in the demand centres of Japan, China and South Korea prepare for the peak winter consumption season. The weather outlook for North Asia is for average conditions in the next 45 days, with Tokyo expecting slightly above average temperatures and Seoul expecting slightly cooler conditions, according to data in Refinitiv Eikon. Beijing is expected to experience temperatures around the seasonal norm, the data showed. Strong overall demand has returned the gas industry to good health after years of spending cuts and project cancellations between 2014 and 2017. Royal Dutch Shell, which has the world’s biggest LNG portfolio, this week announced it would go ahead with the 14 million tonnes per annum LNG Canada project, at a cost estimate of $31 billion. The project is expected to deliver its first LNG cargo in 2025. Reporting by Henning Gloystein

The price cut sparked fears of the country going back toward the regulated regime where the prices of diesel and petrol were controlled by the government. Petrol prices were regulated until 2012, while diesel prices remained so until 2014. The government on Thursday announced a 2.50 rupees-per-litre cut in the prices of gasoline and diesel to reduce the burden on the Indian masses from a sharp rise in crude oil prices and a weak local currency that have pushed prices at fuel pumps to all-time highs. The price cut involved a reduction in excise duty of 1.50 per litre by the government and a further cut of 1 rupee per litre by the state-owned oil marketing companies - Indian Oil Corp Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd. “The current decision could have an impact on the margins of the OMCs although one has to wait and see what course the government takes with a further fall in rupee and rise in crude prices,” said Gagan Dixit, a senior oil and gas analyst at Elara Capital in Mumbai. The price cut also hurts private fuel marketers - Nayara Energy owned by Russian oil giant Rosneft which owns close to 5,000 fuel outlets in the country and Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries Ltd which owns 1,325 outlets as they would also be forced to sell fuel at a loss to compete with the state-owned companies.

2018-10-05,"COPENHAGEN, Oct 5 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Around the world, more than 70 major cities have pledged to end their reliance on fossil fuels and stop pumping out climate-changing emissions by 2050. But Copenhagen - a city of wind turbines, bicycles and reliable public transportation - thinks it can go even further: It intends to accomplish that shift in just seven years. It will require a complete reimagining of how the Danish capital is powered and designed - and a lot of cyclists, officials admit. “Why are we going for that? People might say what we do in Copenhagen doesn’t really matter on the global stage at all. We are tiny,” said Jørgen Abildgaard, director of the city’s climate programme. But with cities and countries around the world still searching for ways to turn the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change into a reality, “it’s important to show that it’s possible to make this transition” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Scandinavian cities have long been seen as green leaders - and Copenhagen is no exception. While other cities have parking garages for cars, Copenhagen has them for bicycles. Virtually all its 600,000 residents own a bicycle, and the city has 375 kilometres of dedicated cycle lanes. The harbour-rimmed municipality also is mostly powered by clean energy - and it has its own renewable energy company and wind turbines. Running its own energy systems is one of the reasons Copenhagen is already well on track to being carbon neutral - meaning it will produce no more carbon emissions than it can offset elsewhere - by 2025. The city’s concerted efforts to go green put it firmly ahead of the schedule set by almost 200 nations in Paris to effectively phase out greenhouse gases between 2050 and 2100. Leading climate scientists will warn next week that global carbon emissions from energy use will have to plunge by up to seven percent a year to meet Paris’ toughest goals - unless technologies to suck carbon from the air and store it are developed, according to a draft U.N. report obtained by Reuters. Copenhagen’s officials are confident the city can largely achieve its ambitious goals. “We want to be 100 percent (carbon neutral by 2025). But if we are 95 percent or around that, it’s still a big success,” said Abildgaard, who has overseen the city’s efforts toward carbon neutrality ever since it made its pledge in 2009, when it hosted U.N. climate talks. In 2017, Copenhagen produced about 1.37 million tonnes of climate-changing gases, down 40 percent from 2005, according to city figures. That’s about 2.2 tonnes of emissions per capita, one of the lowest rates for a European city. The city said the reduction in emissions was largely due to a switch to wind energy under HOFOR, the city’s own utility company. “We are some of the muscle that the city has to be able to (use to) reach its goals,” said Jörgen Edström, head of strategy and business development at HOFOR, one of many energy companies in the city. “The city wanted to build windmills to compensate for its electricity consumption - so we built windmills. They have a company to do the things they want to do,” he said. HOFOR has invested billions of euros to build 360 wind turbines by 2025 to power most of the city, and will soon replace its coal-fired power plants with biomass-powered units that burn sustainable wood pellets, the company says. Around the world, cities consume more than two-thirds of the world’s energy and account for about three-quarters of carbon dioxide emissions, according to the United Nations. That means finding ways for cities to become carbon neutral will be key to meeting the Paris commitment to keep the rise in global temperatures to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. “Cities are where the emissions are the largest. So if cities can solve the problems, then that’s part of the way to a more carbon neutral world,” Edström said. In its quest to cut emissions, Copenhagen has another distinct advantage: For over 100 years, the city - and Denmark as a whole - has relied on district heating, a system where heat is produced and supplied from one neighbourhood or area plant, instead of per household. That means the city itself can make the switch to cleaner energy for large numbers of residents, cutting carbon emissions by over half compared to the use of individual gas or oil boilers, HOFOR says. The city also has a newly-built district cooling system, which uses seawater to cool buildings and households, cutting energy consumption up to 80 percent compared to traditional methods of air-conditioning, HOFOR said. By 2025, the city aims to be powered entirely by wind, sun, geothermal energy, waste, and wood and other biomass. Yet despite its huge investment in new, clean technologies, one of the city’s big priorities is cutting prices for energy users. “The municipality didn’t say, ‘Spend all the money to achieve the carbon-neutral agenda.’ They said, ‘We want lower prices and we want carbon neutrality’,” Edström said. That aim looks to be within reach. A couple living in a flat will save an average of 4,000 Danish krones (537 euros) each year on energy consumption if the city reaches its climate goals, the city says. Abildgaard, Copenhagen’s climate director, said it was crucial to work closely with industries such as construction and transport to devise business models and technologies that work both to meet business goals and cut emissions. “We want to keep our economic growth and improve our infrastructure, and make that transition without extra costs,” Abildgaard said. LOWER -AND HIGHER As the city’s emissions-cutting commitments have grown, so has its economy, which has seen 25 percent growth over the past two decades, according to research by the London School of Economics and Political Science. Strong action to combat climate change could cumulatively add at least $26 trillion to the world economy by 2030, according to a September study by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, which includes former heads of government, business leaders and economists. Copenhagen plans to spend at least 2.7 billion Danish krones (362 million euros) by 2025 to roll out its plan to achieve carbon neutrality - but that should attract nearly 300 billion krones (40 billion euros) in private green investment, according to the city council. The city’s climate-friendly efforts includes expanding its public transport system and cycle paths, retrofitting buildings with poor energy efficiency, investing in research for cleaner technologies and boosting the use of electric vehicles. Abildgaard, who cycles 10 kilometres a day to his harbourside offices in central Copenhagen, said transport remained a major challenge, both because most residents still own a car and because freight trucks are commonly used to deliver goods. He said he is pushing for a congestion charge system, similar to those in London and Oslo, where vehicles are charged a fee when they enter zones in the city centre. Still, Abildgaard is confident Copenhagen will be the first big capital to become carbon neutral - so confident, in fact, that he now wants residents to take another big step. That is taking into account not just emissions generated in Copenhagen but those produced when residents buy things made or grown elsewhere, from clothing to food. “The whole holistic view is important. Environment issues are part of the DNA here. But we also have to recognise that this is not the situation around the world,” Abildgaard said.

2018-10-05,"* Treasury yields rise to 7-yr highs, yield curve steepen * 30-yr Treasuries signals higher yields- Doubleline’s Gundlach * Oil continues to retreat from 4-year highs * Investors await U.S. jobs data for Sept due later on Friday By Tomo Uetake TOKYO, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Asian shares were fragile on Friday after benchmark U.S. Treasury yields surged to a seven-year high and strong economic data fanned concerns about inflation and the risk of faster-than-expected interest rate rises. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.3 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei dropped 0.5 percent and Australian benchmark was up just 0.1 percent. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note hit a fresh seven-year high of 3.232 percent overnight following data released the previous day that was seen as increasing the odds a Friday payrolls report would also be stronger than expected. Wall Street stocks, in turn, have fallen broadly on Thursday, with the Dow suffering its first decline in six sessions and both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq seeing their worst day since June 25. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.75 percent, while the S&P 500 lost 0.82 percent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.81 percent. The CBOE Global Markets volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, jumped as high as 15.84 points, its highest since Aug. 15. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier this week the economy can expand for “quite some time,” which also helped the yield curve steepen to its highest in two months. Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of Doubleline Capital, told Reuters on Thursday that the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield has broken above a multi-year base, which should lead to significantly higher yields for financial markets. “As I have been saying, two consecutive closes above 3.25 percent on the benchmark 30-year Treasury means that my statement in July 2016 that we were seeing the low - I said italicized, underlined and in boldface - is now, looking at the charts, thoroughly corroborated,” he said. On Thursday, the 30-year Treasury note closed at 3.35 percent, compared with 3.34 percent on Wednesday. The surge in Treasury yields has also prompted a rise in government bond yields across the globe, with a major exception being Italy, where borrowing costs dropped after the government said it would cut budget deficit targets from 2020. Japanese and euro zone bond yields rose sharply, tracking their U.S. counterparts. The U.S. dollar was steady but lingered near recent highs against the euro and the yen as investors assessed U.S. economic data and Powell’s remarks. The dollar index was flat, with the euro was also little changed at $1.1517. The Japanese yen softened 0.1 percent versus the greenback at 113.98 per dollar. Investors are expected to scour the U.S. government’s September payroll report scheduled for release on Friday and look closely for signs of wage growth, especially in light of anecdotal indications of rising wages. “Although we are likely to see strong payroll figures later today, we could see some corrections in markets ahead of a long weekend in the United States and Japan,” said Naoki Iwami, fixed income chief investment officer at Whiz Partners. Oil prices rose on Friday, two days after hitting four-year highs, lifted by looming U.S. sanctions against Iran’s crude exports that are set to start next month. U.S. crude oil futures rose 0.7 percent to $74.85 a barrel and Brent crude futures gained 0.5 percent to $85.00 a barrel. Reporting by Tomo Uetake

2018-10-05,"(Repeats with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices continue to climb despite attempts by oil producers to reassure the market about availability and the existence of enough spare capacity to offset oil lost as a result of U.S. sanctions on Iran. Recent price moves bear a strong resemblance to previous price spikes in 2007-2008 and 2010-2012, especially if prices are expressed in euros or yen to eliminate the impact of a stronger dollar this time around. Brent crude has risen to almost 75 euros per barrel, the same level it reached in May 2008, on its way to a peak of 93 euros in July 2008 (tmsnrt.rs/2OzVObC). Front-month futures have also hit 9,800 yen per barrel, the same as in October 2007, on their way to a peak of 15,300 yen in July 2008 (tmsnrt.rs/2OzVRUQ). Prices in Indian rupees are already at the same level that they peaked in 2008 and on the way to the record set in 2013 (tmsnrt.rs/2OG5HEy). Only the strength of the dollar against other currencies is masking how high prices have become in oil-consuming countries outside the United States (tmsnrt.rs/2ODp8hm and tmsnrt.rs/2OFSSug). Prices have already risen to a level that has contributed to a slowdown in economic growth and oil consumption in the past. “Expensive energy is back at a bad time for the global economy,” the chief executive of the International Energy Agency has warned (“IEA boss urges oil producers to ease supply concerns”, Reuters, Oct. 4). “It is now high time for all the players, especially those key producers and oil exporters, to consider the situation and take the right steps to comfort the market,” he added. The blame-shifting game is well underway, with the United States blaming OPEC, Russia faulting U.S. sanctions, and Saudi Arabia blaming speculators for escalating prices. In reality, U.S. sanctions, output restrictions by OPEC and its allies, strong consumption growth and position building among the hedge funds have all contributed to the price surge. Aggressive implementation of U.S. sanctions on Iran has left refiners and traders concerned about the future availability of crude and questioning whether OPEC will still have enough spare capacity to offset any other losses. OPEC and its allies became fixated on cutting oil inventories down to the five-year average and waited far too long to start exiting from production curbs, causing the market to overtighten. And oil consumption has grown much faster than most analysts forecast at the start of the year, while many non-OPEC sources of supply have risen more slowly than expected. Despite communications between policymakers in the United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia to synchronise output increases with the re-introduction of sanctions there seem to have been a series of misunderstandings. Policymakers appear to have misjudged how quickly the United States would try to cut Iran’s exports and how rapidly other OPEC and non-OPEC producers could fill the gap. Sensing the market is moving into a cyclical period of under-supply and low spare capacity, hedge funds and other money managers have built bullish long positions, accelerating and exaggerating the price adjustment. The oil market has become locked in an upward price trend as hedge funds and market makers all try to maintain neutral or long positions and few speculative players are willing to take the short side of the market. Hedge funds and other money managers have accumulated bullish long positions betting on a further rise in prices amounting to almost 1.2 billion barrels of oil. At the same time, the number of short positions in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts has fallen to its lowest level since before 2013. The imbalance between bullish and bearish positions is close to a record, an analysis of regulatory and exchange data showed. Lopsided positioning has often been the precursor to a sharp reversal in the price trend when fund managers attempt to realise profits by closing some positions. The impact of lopsided positioning on the evolution of prices has been explored by researchers including the physicist Didier Sornette (“Why stock markets crash: critical events in complex financial systems”, 2017). But while lopsided positioning is a key signal for a future price reversal it does not indicate how quickly that reversal will take place and at what price level it will occur. In 2007/08, oil prices continued trending higher for some months, even as analysts warned they had become unsustainable. Oil prices tend to overshoot on the upside (2008 and 2011) just as they have done on the downside (1998, 2009 and 2016) before correcting. Typically, prices peak only once there is clear evidence of a slowdown in oil consumption growth and/or OPEC producers come under intense political pressure to increase production. In the meantime, oil prices have risen to a level that is sending a strong signal to non-dollar consumers about the need to increase efficiency, reduce use and switch to alternative fuels.

2018-10-05,"* U.S. sanctions set to start on November 4 * Financial markets have accumulated large long positions By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Friday, lifted by looming U.S. sanctions against Iran’s crude exports that are set to start next month. The gains helped claw back some of the losses from the previous session due to rising U.S. inventories and after Saudi Arabia and Russia said they would raise output to at least partly make up for expected disruptions from Iran. International benchmark Brent crude oil futures were at $84.94 per barrel at 0008 GMT, up 36 cents, or 0.4 percent from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 41 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $77.74 a barrel. “Crude oil prices drifted lower (on Thursday) on combination of rising oil production in Saudi Arabia and Russia and a build-up of inventories in the U.S.. That said, prices remained resilient as supply worries persist amid looming Iranian sanctions,” ANZ bank said on Friday. Overall oil market sentimant is bullish. Financial traders have accumulated bullish long positions betting on a further rise in prices amounting to almost 1.2 billion barrels of oil. Meanwhile, the number of short positions in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts has fallen to the lowest level since before 2013, creating a near-record imbalance between bullish and bearish positions in financial crude markets.
