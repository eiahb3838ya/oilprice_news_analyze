2018-03-10,"LILLE, France (Reuters) - Former White House strategist Steve Bannon on Saturday waxed lyrical about Marion Marechal-Le Pen, the young niece of French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, seeing a great future ahead of the “rising star”. The champion of Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda, who was invited to speak at the National Front party congress in northern France by Marine Le Pen, spoke only about her 28-year old niece at their joint press conference. “She is not simply a rising star on the right in France. She’s one of the most impressive people in the entire world,” Bannon, an American nationalist who ran the right-wing Breitbart News, told reporters, without mentioning his host Marine Le Pen. Bannon met Marion, who temporarily withdrew from politics after her aunt’s presidential election defeat last May, at the CPAC conservative conference in Maryland last month, where he said she was “absolutely electrifying.” Marion’s U.S. speech was widely commented on in French media as posing a challenge for Marine Le Pen. Asked by reporters how she felt about Bannon’s comments, Marine Le Pen turned to the American and said that journalists were trying to stir up competition between the two women. “They don’t understand that we defend the same ideas, in the education field for her and in politics for me,” she said. “They’re asking me how I feel about the good things you said about Marion, to which I reply: they make me glad.” Bannon then quipped: “We call that fake news.” Marine Le Pen was hoping that the National Front congress in Lille would help her reassert her authority, after her defeat to pro-Europe centrist Emmanuel Macron prompted criticism of her style and policies. Marion Marechal-Le Pen, a former lawmaker, is more socially conservative and economically liberal than her aunt. She was not present at the congress in Lille on Saturday, having said she is now working on an education project. Addressing the FN congress earlier, Bannon was given a standing ovation, as he told party members history was on their side and would eventually lead them to victory. “What I’ve learned is that you’re part of a worldwide movement that’s bigger than France, bigger than Italy, bigger than Hungary, bigger than all of us,” he said. “I did not come here as a teacher, I came here to Europe as an observer and to learn,” he added, pointing at recent elections in Italy as a sign of a rising populist wave. Bannon was fired by the White House last August, though he continued to speak with Trump and tried to promote the president’s agenda.

2018-03-10,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson cancelled scheduled events on Saturday on the second day of a visit to Kenya because he had been feeling unwell, a State Department spokesman said, adding that he would resume his programme on Sunday. “The secretary is not feeling well after a long couple days working on major issues back home such as North Korea and has cancelled his events for the day,” spokesman Steve Goldstein told reporters travelling with Tillerson. “Some events will go ahead without him, while they are looking at the possibility of rescheduling others,” said Goldstein, under-secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs at the State Department. Goldstein later said the secretary’s health had improved. “The Secretary is feeling better and will resume his normal schedule tomorrow,” he said. Tillerson, 65, is four days into his first diplomatic trip to Africa, where he has visited Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya, and is scheduled to go on to Nigeria and Chad.  During the trip he has also been involved behind the scenes in discussions within the administration on a possible meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  A U.S. embassy official in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, said U.S. Ambassador to Kenya Bob Godec and Kenyan Health Minister Sicily Kariuki would attend events on Saturday morning. Tillerson had been scheduled to lay a wreath at the site of the 1998 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Nairobi, in which more than 200 people were killed, and attend an event to highlight U.S. health assistance in Africa.

2018-03-10,"BEIJING (Reuters) - State-controlled China Huarong Asset Management Co has bought a 36.2 percent stake in the unit of CEFC China Energy through which CEFC is acquiring a $9.1 billion (6.57 billion pounds) stake in Russia’s Rosneft (ROSN.MM), a filing by the CEFC unit showed. Huarong (2799.HK) acquired the stake in CEFC Hainan International in two tranches, in December and in February, according to a filing on Feb. 13 by CEFC Hainan at an online portal run by the State Administration for Industry & Commerce (SAIC). CEFC subsidiary CEFC Shanghai International Group Co owns the remaining 63.8 percent in CEFC Hainan.  Huarong made the stake purchase through its unit, Huarong Ruitong Equity Investment Management Co. It was not immediately clear how much Huarong paid for the stake, but the filing showed CEFC Hainan’s registered capital expanded by 9.6 billion yuan as a result of Huarong Ruitong’s fund injection. Huarong Ruitong and CEFC did not immediately comment.  Chinese financial publication Caixin, in a story published late Friday, quoted an unnamed China Huarong official as saying the firm did not purchase the stake and instead was ordered to conduct a debt-for-equity swap by the government.        China Huarong could not immediately be reached for comment.  Reuters and other Chinese and international media reported last week that Ye Jianming, the chairman and founder of privately owned CEFC, had been investigated for suspected economic crimes. CEFC subsequently denied this and said operations were normal. In just a few years, CEFC has transformed from a niche fuel trader into a rapidly growing oil and finance conglomerate, with assets across the world and an ambition to become one of China’s energy giants. It agreed in September to buy a 14.16 percent stake in Rosneft for $9.1 billion. Huarong Ruitong, responsible for fundraising, project selection, debt acquisition and equity management for Huarong’s debt-for-equity swap deals, planned to raise a 50 billion yuan investment fund for deals, Huarong said in early 2017.

2018-03-10,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration will send five cabinet secretaries to a U.S. Senate hearing next week to tout its plan to spur $1.5 trillion infrastructure improvements using $200 billion in new federal funding. The heads of the Transportation, Commerce, Labor, Agriculture and Energy departments will testify on March 14 before the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee. Democrats have criticized the plan, saying Republicans must agree to new revenue to fund projects, and that the plan shifts too much of the burden to states and cities. “Testimony from these five cabinet secretaries will support a comprehensive public discussion with senators about the White House proposal for aligning federal resources with local infrastructure needs and helping complete projects faster,” said Senator John Thune, who chairs the Commerce Committee. Senate Democrats this week proposed $1 trillion in new federal spending paid for by repealing some tax cuts approved in December. President Donald Trump’s proposal would fund the $200 billion federal contribution to infrastructure with cuts from other federal spending. It would also shift more costs to states and cities by reducing federal matching funds.  A separate Senate hearing is planned Tuesday to address state and local transportation infrastructure, including rail issues. Another Senate hearing Tuesday will address broadband infrastructure issues. Trump’s infrastructure plan unveiled in February would also eliminate bureaucratic roadblocks to completing projects that can tie up new roads for years. Democrats insist that any plan must include new revenue, which could mean raising the federal gasoline tax. That levy has been 18.4 cents a gallon since 1993, and inflation and rising vehicle fuel efficiency have reduced its usefulness in raising enough money to keep pace with repair needs. House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday that Congress is likely to pass a series of five or six smaller infrastructure measures this year, rather than one big bill. Ryan ruled out a gasoline tax Wednesday, while Trump reportedly backed a 25-cent per gallon hike last month in a meeting with lawmakers. Congress transferred $140 billion to the Highway Trust Fund since 2008. Lawmakers, to maintain current spending levels, would need to approve an additional $107 billion from 2021 through 2026. The Trump administration also unveiled workforce training proposals, including expanding apprenticeships and seeking changes to federal work-study programs that typically are used by students at four-year institutions. It would allow more students interested in skilled trades to use them.

2018-03-10,"ACAPULCO (Reuters) - Mexico’s left-wing presidential frontrunner on Friday tried to assuage the fears of a sceptical audience of bankers that he would run a radical economic agenda, vowing not to nationalize, expropriate or drive the country deeper into debt. Speaking at a major banking conference in the Pacific resort of Acapulco, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador received mixed reviews for a speech packed with promises not to disrupt economic stability, but short on new policy proposals. “We will support banks and we won’t confiscate assets,” he said. “There won’t be expropriations or nationalizations.” He said he would not raise taxes or debt and vowed to respect central bank autonomy. Lopez Obrador’s commitments to respecting the financial system and seeking ways to expand access to banking were welcome, said Rodrigo Zorrilla, the president of CitiBanamex.  But some bankers said the presidential candidate, known locally as AMLO, did not give enough concrete policy proposals to set their hearts racing. “AMLO lost the opportunity during this convention to present to the banking sector how he plans to accelerate the economy in Mexico in the short, medium and long term,” said Diego Folino, the deputy chief executive at the Bank of China Mexico. “There was an absence of strategic proposals.” Lopez Obrador, 64, has sought the presidency twice before. This time, with a double-digit lead over his nearest rival in most opinion polls, he has sought to soften his image, moderating his previous opposition to the government’s attempts to open up Mexico’s energy sector to foreign investment, and surrounding himself with former rivals.  Lopez Obrador’s governance would ultimately be dictated by his margin of victory, noted Zorrilla. “If he wins by a small margin, his policies are likely to be more moderate,” he said. Former Mexico City mayor Lopez Obrador reminded the audience that he worked closely with the private sector when he ran the capital from 2000-2005, while making clear where his priorities lie.  “We are going to listen to everyone, respect everyone ... for the benefit of everyone - first of all the poor,” he said. His focus would be on governance rather than legislative changes, and those there were would not be until the middle of his six-year term, he added. He received polite applause for a speech that prioritised increasing welfare spending, reviving the rural economy and building new oil refineries.  But the well-heeled crowd responded more enthusiastically to his political rivals, including Ricardo Anaya, candidate for a right-left alliance, who talked of bringing a 21st century knowledge economy to Mexico fuelled by clean energy.  Ruling party candidate, former finance minister Jose Antonio Meade, received rowdy applause for a speech that focused on improving the rule of law and economic stability. Meade is in third place in most polls after a damaging fight with Anaya, who has also lost support in recent polls.

2018-03-10,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. mining industry asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday to overturn an Obama-era rule that prohibits the mining of uranium on public lands adjacent to the Grand Canyon National Park.  The National Mining Association (NMA) and the American Exploration and Mining Association (AEMA) filed petitions asking the court to reverse the Obama administration’s 2012 ban on new uranium mining claims on more than 1 million acres of public land adjacent to the canyon. In 2012, Ken Salazar, then the secretary of the interior, instituted the ban for 20 years on the public lands that the Havasupai tribe relies on for water. The ban was upheld by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in December. NMA spokesman Luke Popovich said his organization was challenging Salazar’s constitutional authority to declare the large land withdrawal, and he said uranium mining does not harm the land.  “There is scant evidence that uranium mining outside the park boundaries poses any threat to either the environment or visitor experience,” Popovich said. He said Salazar ignored a finding by the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management that showed mining would have little impact.  Conservation groups disagreed and said the ban should remain in place until scientists have time to study the contamination risks. “Is it worth gambling the future of the Grand Canyon to allow private companies to line their pockets when the risks to groundwater are unknown?” said Roger Clark, a program director at the Grand Canyon Trust. Currently the global uranium market is so flooded that mining in the United States for the mineral used in nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons is not profitable. But that could change as the administration of President Donald Trump is considering protections on the mineral that could increase demand for domestically mined uranium.  Last month uranium miner Energy Fuels said it had won federal approvals to expand operations at two mines in southeastern Utah after years of challenges from conservation groups worried about emissions of radon gas. Other companies have urged Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to reverse the 2012 ban. Last May, Vane Minerals LLC, a company in Arizona, told Zinke in a letter the company would appreciate it if he could begin the process to “terminate” the ban. A copy of the letter was seen by Reuters. Vane did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the letter. The Interior Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the letter or the petitions.
