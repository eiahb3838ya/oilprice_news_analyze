2018-09-17,"(Adds U.S. market open, byline, dateline; previous LONDON) * U.S. likely to announce tariffs on $200 bln in Chinese goods * Wall St dragged by Apple, Amazon, fears of fresh tariffs * Dollar broadly weaker as trade concerns weigh * Oil trades mixed on supply, demand concerns By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, Sept 17 (Reuters) - A gauge of global equity markets eased and the dollar slipped on Monday as investors took a dim view of an expected new round of tariffs from Washington on Chinese goods, which would escalate a simmering U.S.-Sino dispute over trade. U.S. President Donald Trump was expected to announce new tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods as early as Monday, and China has said it would retaliate. A weaker dollar lifted gold prices and the price of most industrial metals slipped as the tit-for-tat dispute has fueled concerns that demand for metals will weaken. Apple and Amazon.com bore the brunt of investor worries about the tariffs, which were on a list unveiled in July that included $200 billion worth of internet technology products, other electronics, printed circuit boards and consumer goods. “Investors are slowly starting to realize that these new tariffs could be extremely disruptive to the supply chain,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York. The trade tiff has yet to be felt in U.S. markets as the tariffs, which now are set at 3.8 percent, may rise to just 10 percent, which most companies can handle in a growing economy, said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at Nuveen. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.23 percent while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares rose 0.05 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 8.84 points, or 0.03 percent, to 26,145.83. The S&P 500 lost 8.27 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,896.71 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 72.22 points, or 0.9 percent, to 7,937.82. The dollar’s weakening is a good sign for global markets, especially in emerging markets where the strong dollar has been a cause for concern, Nick said. The greenback has benefited from safe-haven flows as the U.S.-Chinese trade conflict worsened. The dollar index fell 0.4 percent and the euro rose 0.48 percent to $1.1684. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.05 percent versus the greenback at 112.02 per dollar. U.S. Treasury yields rose across the board on growing expectations the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in September and December, and perhaps at least twice more in 2019. Yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note touched 3.022 percent, the highest level since late May. U.S. 30-year yields also hit a four-month peak of 3.159 percent, while 2-year yields soared to 2.799 percent, the strongest level in 10 years. The benchmark U.S. 10-year note last rose 1/32 in price to yield 2.9922 percent. Yields on 10-year German bunds rose to 0.472 percent, but pared losses to trade at 0.458 percent. Oil prices were little changed as traders weighed potential supply cuts from U.S. sanctions on Iran against deepening trade tensions between the United States and China that could dent global crude demand. Brent crude futures rose 11 cents to $78.20 a barrel by 11:12 a.m. EDT (1512 GMT), while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 3 cents to $68.96 a barrel.

2018-09-17,"OSLO (Reuters) - Members of Nasdaq’s Nordic commodities exchange have fully replenished vital clearing house contingency funds that were lost last week when a single Norwegian trader defaulted, the exchange operator said. Einar Aas, a derivatives trader who made large bets on the power market, left a 114 million euro ($133 million) hole in the clearing house buffers when his funds ran out, drawing scrutiny from regulators seeking to clarify whether rules were broken. Energy firms and other players on the 166-member market had been given until the end of Monday to cover the loss or face default themselves. “The Member Default Fund now has been recapitalized by 100 percent, or 107 million euros ($125 million),” Nasdaq (NDAQ.O) said in a statement. The company had previously said it would replace the remaining loss of 7 million euros itself. Clearing houses like the one operated by Nasdaq are vital for the stability of markets, acting as an intermediary in stock, bond or derivatives transactions and ensuring completion if one side goes bust. “Finansinspektionen (the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority) is following up on whether Nasdaq Clearing has acted in compliance with current regulation and whether the regulation is sufficient,” the Swedish financial markets regulator said in a statement late on Friday. The clearing house will also hire an external party to review its handling of the case, Nasdaq Clearing Chief Executive Officer Julia Haglind told Reuters. While Aas had bet that Nordic-German spreads would narrow, this backfired on Sept. 10 as heavy rain pushed down prices in the hydroelectric-dependant Nordic region, while a spike in the cost of carbon drove up German prices, Nasdaq said.     In a single day, the difference between Nordic and German power prices for 2019 widened by 5.56 euros, 17 times more than the average daily move and exceeding the maximum level of 4 euros for which Nasdaq Clearing’s risk model had been calibrated. Since 2011, when the current pricing system was set up, the largest change in Nordic-German spreads on any single day had been 1.6 euros, Nasdaq said, calling the Sept. 10 market move “a true ‘Black Swan’ event.”     GRAPHIC: German and Nordic year-ahead power prices - reut.rs/2D3NJHs Nordic power prices continued to fall on Monday due to wet weather and lingering concerns about the default, said Lauri Riihimaki, a trading manager at Finnish energy services company Enegia. Following the default of Aas, Nasdaq’s clearing house on Friday said it would adjust its models and demand bigger capital buffers in order to shift more of the risk from the mutualized default fund to the owners of individual portfolios. “The fact that they are increasing marginal requirements could decrease (market) liquidity,” investor relations manager Maans Holmberg at Finnish power firm Fortum (FORTUM.HE) told Reuters. “But if they didn’t increase them after last week’s event maybe some members would anyway reduce their liquidity as they may be worried about trading safety,” he said. “Lower liquidity could be an outcome of this, it is completely logical. After an incident like this it is normal that you will see an effect on liquidity. And it is unfortunate as we have seen liquidity falling over the years,” he added. Nasdaq on Friday also deposited $22 million in additional funds on a temporary basis to help restore trust in the market, the exchange said. Aas is now barred from trading, and said on Thursday that he risked personal bankruptcy.

2018-09-17,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover (TAMO.NS) said it will go down to a three-day week at its Castle Bromwich plant in central England just days after its boss warned about the impact of Brexit and diesel policy on manufacturing. The Castle Bromwich facility will operate a three-day week from October until the beginning of December in a move which will affect around 1,000 staff but avoid job cuts, a spokeswoman said. “In light of the continuing headwinds impacting the car industry, we are making some temporary adjustments to our production schedules at Castle Bromwich,” the company said in a statement. Last week, the firm’s boss Ralf Speth warned that the wrong Brexit deal could cost tens of thousands of car jobs and risks production at the firm, especially if there are delays at ports and on motorways due to customs checks.  He also said that the government had demonized diesel cars, contributing to 1,000 job losses at the company earlier this year.  Conservative lawmaker and Brexit supporter Bernard Jenkin earlier on Monday accused Speth of “making it up” when asked about the automotive boss’s comments, which included a warning that it was already more attractive to build cars abroad with Brexit adding uncertainty. The Unite union blamed Prime Minister Theresa May as she battles to convince many of her own members of parliament to support her Brexit proposals which she says will maintain frictionless trade and protect jobs, but have angered many Brexiteers.  “This is the continuing effect of the chaotic mismanagement of the Brexit negotiations by the government which has created uncertainty across the UK’s automotive industry and the manufacturing sector generally,” said Assistant General Secretary Tony Burke.  A slump in demand for diesel cars is also having a big impact on the firm.  About 90 percent of Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR) sales in Britain are diesel models, which compares with around 45 percent globally, the company said earlier this year.  Diesel sales have fallen this year nearly 30 percent in Britain, Europe’s second-biggest car market, mirroring similar drops in other major markets, as governments crack down on the segment in the wake of Volkswagen emissions scandal.  JLR said on Monday it was investing to protect its plants in the future. “We have invested more than £4bn since 2010 to future proof manufacturing technologies to deliver new models,” its statement said.

2018-09-17,"(Updates with more details, background) By Asif Shahzad ISLAMABAD, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Pakistan on Monday increased natural gas prices by up to 20 percent, Petroleum Minister Chaudhry Mohammad Sarwar said, in effect slashing consumer subsidies that were a fiscal drag on the government’s budget. Sarwar said the move would help ease part of the 152 billion rupee ($1.24 billion) deficit for state-owned Sui Northern and Sui Southern, the two main suppliers of natural gas that are bleeding cash and subsidising consumers and industries. The decision was taken by the Economic Coordination Committee chaired by new Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has vowed radical economic reforms. “It was a tough decision for us to take,” Sarwar said, adding that the price hike was “10 to 20 percent”, depending on how much gas the user consumed. The new measures would inject “58 billion rupees to stabilise the two companies”, Sarwar added. The price hike is some way off the 46 percent rise recommended by Pakistan’s regulator, which is roughly the increase needed if the gas providers were to break even and de facto subsidies be terminated. Such price rises are politically sensitive in Pakistan, which has enjoyed decades of cheap gas due to its natural resources. However, over the past decade those gas reserves have not been enough and Pakistan experienced a number of shortages until it began importing liquefied natural gas (LNG), which is more expensive than domestic gas. Sarwar said Pakistani consumers would be given relief via a reduction in most taxes on LNG, except a 10 percent sales tax. Pakistan is struggling to avert a currency crisis that could force it to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. The country’s current-account deficit has ballooned in recent years, while the fiscal deficit has shot up to 6.8 percent of the economy in the year that ended June 30.

2018-09-17,"LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell announced on Monday plans to limit leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, across its oil and gas operations as it tries to sharply curb carbon emissions. Shell aims to maintain methane emissions below 0.2 percent of its total oil and gas production by 2025, it said in a statement, joining British rival BP, which last year set a similar goal. Larger rival Exxon Mobil announced in May plans to reduce methane emissions by 15 percent by 2020. Methane is released into the atmosphere mostly from the burning of excess gas, known as flaring, as well as through leaks in gas infrastructure such as wells, pumps and pipelines.  The gas has a bigger greenhouse impact than carbon dioxide, even though the oil and gas industry produces less methane and the gas also has a shorter lifetime. The methane target will be measured against a baseline leak rate, which is currently estimated at range from 0.01 percent to 0.8 percent across the company’s oil and gas assets, it said. The Anglo-Dutch company set out last year an ambitious plan to halve its carbon emissions by 2050, far exceeding rivals. Investors have called on the company to set binding targets to reach those goals. Climate change and emissions, caused by burning fossil fuels, have moved to the forefront of discussions between energy companies and investors since the signing of the 2015 U.N.-backed Paris climate agreement that seeks to curb emissions to zero by the end of the century in order to limit global warming. “The race to near-zero methane emissions is on,” said Ben Ratner, director at Environmental Defense Fund, U.S-based non-profit climate advocacy. “Company leadership on methane does not stop with setting targets. Follow through with good data and transparency are vital.” Shell’s methane emissions reached 123,000 tonnes last year, accounting for around 5 percent of its total greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website.

2018-09-17,"* U.S. likely to announce tariffs on $200 bln in Chinese goods * European shares down after falls in Asia * Dollar slips but currency markets quiet * Oil rebounds on supply concerns * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Updates throughout) By Tommy Wilkes LONDON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Stock markets headed south on Monday as investors took fright at news that Washington was set to announce a new round of tariffs on Chinese goods in the latest escalation of their trade conflict. U.S. President Donald Trump’s expected announcement of new tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods drew an immediate threat of reprisals from Beijing. Trump took to Twitter early on Monday to say: “If countries will not make fair deals with us, they will be “Tariffed!” The growing trade conflict between the world’s two largest economies has long unnerved investors who fear an escalation could eventually whack global growth, while talks between the two countries have failed to make much headway. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell as much as 0.2 percent, while Germany’s DAX, home to large exporters and carmakers, dropped half a percent. France’s CAC 40 and Britain’s FTSE 100 each fell 0.3 percent. Last week, Europe’s STOXX 600 had enjoyed its best weekly gain since July as the Turkish central bank’s interest rate rise brought a broad relief rally, but the mood was less buoyant on Monday. The falls in Europe followed weakness across Asian markets. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 1.2 percent, snapping three straight sessions of gains. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, remains more than 5 percent off its record high touched in January, and down 0.8 percent in September. “On the Chinese side, Mr. Trump has burned a lot of political capital so it’s hard to see how talks can resume if Mr. Trump goes ahead on the $200 billion,” Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum. “China’s scope to retaliate is surprisingly limited, however, especially since the outbreak of swine flu, which will anyway push up CPI inflation,” Beamish said, referring to the deadly swine fever strain that is seen impacting Chinese pork prices. The S&P 500 e-minis fell 0.1 percent, indicating Wall Street would open slightly weaker. Beamish doubted whether the United States would slap 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports, as the Trump administration has said it is considering, and the Wall Street Journal reported the tariff level would probably be about 10 percent. Market watchers reckon further escalation is likely, although some investors think Trump’s tariff threats are largely rhetoric aimed at a domestic audience before the mid-term elections in November. They expect tensions to ease once the vote is out of the way. “I think the market has digested more or less all this rollercoaster with tariffs and I think [Trump is] trying to finish off with this matter until November,” said Dimitrios Stefanopoulos, portfolio manager at Alpha Trust in Greece. The dollar fell on Monday, suggesting investor nervousness was limited. The greenback tends to firm during bouts of trade tension as investors seek safety in the world’s most liquid currency. The greenback index slipped 0.2 percent at 94.725, having bounced from a low of 94.359 at the end of last week as Treasury yields rose. The euro added 0.3 percent to $1.1659 and the yen strengthened 0.1 percent to below 111, with broader foreign exchange moves limited. Emerging market currencies were mostly weaker after a strong run last week following the Turkish central bank’s decision to sharply raise interest rates to shore up confidence in the lira. The lira fell more than one percent to 6.2340 while Russia’s rouble dropped 0.2 percent to 68.17 as the effect of a Russian central bank rate hike on Friday faded. European government bond markets were quiet and yields mostly flat, but Italian yields fell 6-8 basis points amid growing hopes that Italian ministers, who meet later on Monday, will agree a market-friendly 2019 budget. Oil prices rebounded from earlier losses despite assurances from Washington that Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States can raise output fast enough to offset falling supplies from Iran and elsewhere. Brent crude oil rose 0.78 percent to $78.70 a barrel. U.S. light crude was up 0.75 percent at $69.51. Gold traded 0.28 percent higher at $1,197.51 an ounce , but was still some way from last week’s top at $1,212.65.

2018-09-17,"NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Major U.S. ethanol producer Green Plains Inc (GPRE.O) is shutting down or cutting output at plants across the Midwest due to low profit margins, five industry sources told Reuters on Monday. The slash in production comes after the Trump administration’s escalating trade disputes cut off U.S. access to ethanol markets in China, contributing to a domestic supply glut that has pushed biofuel prices near their lowest levels in over a decade.  Green Plains idled until further notice its facility in Superior, Iowa, and soon will shut down the plant in Lakota, Iowa, while the company’s plant in Fairmont, Minnesota, was running at half of its capacity, according to three of the sources, who asked not to be named. Two additional sources, both ethanol traders, said even more plants had been shut down or cut production. “They’re taking down some of their best-performing assets,” said one trader, mentioning plants in Fergus Falls, Minnesota and Bluffton, Indiana.  Company spokesman Jim Stark confirmed the Superior plant was temporarily shut down. “Lakota is running and so is Fairmont. We don’t comment on run rates at any particular plant,” Stark said in an email. He declined to comment on Fergus Falls or Bluffton.  Green Plains said in an Aug. 30 regulatory filing it was reassessing production levels based on current market conditions.  Green Plains has annual ethanol production capacity of roughly 1.48 billion gallons, making it about tied with Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) as the No. 3 ethanol maker in the United States, behind POET LLC and Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N). The company said in a May filing it was considering selling some of its assets. Another source familiar with the company said on Monday it was now actively seeking to sell them. Asked for comments about potential sales, Green Plains spokesman Stark said only that its “portfolio optimization plan” would be completed this year.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under former administrator Scott Pruitt issued waivers to some oil refiners exempting them from requirements to blend ethanol into the U.S. gasoline supply. The waivers, coupled with trade tensions between the United States and China, have pressured prices for ethanol.  Green Plains has invested in cattle feedlots and vinegar production in efforts to diversify from biofuel.  Last week, privately held Ergon Inc said it would permanently close its only ethanol plant, in Mississippi. Ethanol output typically declines in September and October as operators perform maintenance to prepare equipment ahead of the new corn harvest. Some plants were likely to extend downtimes this year because of poor profitability. The U.S. Energy Information Administration last week said  average ethanol output dropped 67,000 barrels per day to 1.02 million bpd, the lowest since April.

2018-09-17,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of global equity markets eased and the dollar slipped on Monday as an expected new round of tariffs from Washington on Chinese goods made investors skittish about an escalation of a  U.S.-Sino dispute over trade.  U.S. President Donald Trump said he would announce his latest plan on Chinese commerce after markets closed. He was expected to level tariffs on about $200 billion of Chinese imports, and China has said it would retaliate. A weaker dollar lifted gold prices and the price of most industrial metals slipped as the tit-for-tat dispute has fueled  concerns that demand for metals will weaken. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 1.4 percent, or almost triple the decline of the broad market S&P 500 index. Apple and Amazon.com bore the brunt of investor worries about the tariffs, which were on a list unveiled in July that included $200 billion worth of internet technology products, other electronics, printed circuit boards and consumer goods.   “Investors are slowly starting to realize that these new tariffs could be extremely disruptive to the supply chain,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York. The trade tiff has yet to be felt in U.S. markets as the tariffs, which now are set at 3.8 percent, may rise to just 10 percent, which most companies can handle in a growing economy, said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at Nuveen. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.37 percent while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 of leading regional shares closed up 0.07 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 92.55 points, or 0.35 percent, to 26,062.12. The S&P 500 .SPX lost 16.18 points, or 0.56 percent, to 2,888.8 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 114.25 points, or 1.43 percent, to 7,895.79. The dollar’s weakening is a good sign for global markets, especially in emerging markets where the strong dollar has been a cause for concern, Nuveen’s Nick said. The greenback has benefited from safe-haven flows as the U.S.-Chinese trade conflict worsened. The euro and sterling also advanced against the dollar on optimism that Britain would reach a deal with the European Union on the terms of its departure from the bloc. Talks between the EU and Britain on Brexit are being conducted in a spirit of “good cooperation”, said Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator on the issue. The dollar index .DXY fell 0.46 percent and the euro EUR= rose 0.48 percent to $1.1684. The Japanese yen JPY= strengthened 0.24 percent versus the greenback at 111.78 per dollar. U.S. Treasury yields rose across the board on growing expectations the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in September and December, and perhaps at least twice more in 2019. Yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note touched 3.022 percent, the highest level since late May. U.S. 30-year yields also hit a four-month peak of 3.159 percent, while 2-year yields soared to 2.799 percent, the strongest level in 10 years. The benchmark U.S. 10-year note US10YT=RR last fell 1/32 in price to yield 2.9977 percent. Yields on 10-year German bunds rose to 0.472 percent, but pared losses to trade at 0.458 percent. Oil prices edged lower on concerns over how the U.S.-Sino trade dispute may dent global crude demand, but losses were limited as the market weighed potential supply tightening due to Iran sanctions.

2018-09-17,"HOUSTON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Libyan crude flows to the United States resumed in September after falling to zero last month amid earlier port closures, Thomson Reuters trade flows data showed on Monday. Unrest that closed major Libyan ports cut the chaotic OPEC nation’s crude production in July, but output rebounded by 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in August to 950,000 bpd, and ports reopened, according to the International Energy Agency, which coordinates the energy policies of industrialized nations. Four tankers carrying a total of 2.1 million barrels, or 70,800 barrels per day (bpd), from Libya’s major port in Es Sider and other terminals will arrive or have already made port in Philadelphia, New York and Houston this month. The Seascout arrived on Sept. 4 with 600,000 barrels at Phillips 66’s Bayway Refinery in the Port of New York and New Jersey, the data showed. Phillips 66 declined to comment. The Silverway, chartered by Italian oil major Eni, is set to reach Philadelphia on Wednesday after leaving Libya’s Mellitah port with more than 600,000 barrels. In August, U.S. East Coast refiners including Monroe Energy in Trainer, Pennsylvania, shifted to light, sweet Saharan Blend from Algeria to offset the drop in imports from Libya, Thomson Reuters data show. The U.S. imported 140,000 barrels per day of the Saharan blend in August, the largest volume in two years. Imports of Saharan blend are set to fall to 48,000 bpd in September, the data show. Other African suppliers are able to quickly step in and replace Libyan barrels that are lost due to unrest, said Judith Dwarkin, chief economist at market intelligence firm RS Energy Group. Saharan Blend traded around a $0.70 and $1 discount to global benchmark Brent in August for September delivery and rose to a $0.20 premium in September, traders said.

2018-09-17,"NEW YORK, Sept 17 (Reuters) - A second coal ash leak was reported from a Duke Energy Corp landfill near the company’s retired Sutton Power Plant in Wilmington, North Carolina, following storm Florence, environmental officials said on Monday. One leak was reported from the shuttered plant on Saturday and a second occurred late on Sunday, said Reggie Cheatham, director of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Emergency Management, speaking on a conference call. The cause of the release is unknown and still being investigated, he said. Coal ash can contaminate water. “We are repairing it and we continue to be confident that the public and the environment are well protected,” said Candice Knezevic, a spokeswoman for Duke. In the earlier release, the site lost enough material to fill about two-thirds of an Olympic-sized pool, the company said in a statement. Deeper flooding loomed in the hours and days ahead from rivers in the Carolinas swollen by Tropical Depression Florence, a onetime hurricane that has killed 23 people, even if rain-weary residents got a brief glimpse of sunshine on Monday. Officials had warned before the storm that the rains could risk tainting waterways with murky coal ash and toxic hog waste.

2018-09-17,"NEW YORK, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Strong gasoline inventories on the U.S. East Coast have kept cash prices for the product steady, traders said on Monday, despite refiners recently shutting gasoline-making units in the region due to leaks or to make repairs. High imports into the East Coast have kept inventories up, offsetting any potential supply disruptions from unit shutdowns at Philadelphia Energy Solutions’ (PES) refinery complex in Philadelphia and Phillips 66’s Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey, market sources said. Gasoline and blending components imports into the East Coast have been higher than year-ago levels for each of the last seven months, said Matt Smith, director of commodities research at ClipperData. August imports were about 160,000 barrels per day more than the same time last year, he added. This has pushed stockpiles higher. East Coast gasoline inventories were at 66.75 million barrels in the week to Sept. 7, the highest level for any September on record, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. For a graphic on East Coast inventories, see: tmsnrt.rs/2xlnya0. PES shut the 85,000-bpd gasoline-making unit on Saturday at the Girard Point section of the Philadelphia refinery complex due to a leak. It does not plan to restart the fluid catalytic cracker (FCC) for at least five days, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday. The 150,000-bpd gasoline unit at P66’s Bayway refinery remains shut until the end of the month after the unit had been shut and restarted several times since the end of March, following a two-month turnaround. Additional shutdowns in the region are expected. Monroe Energy plans a refinery-wide shutdown of its 185,000-bpd refinery outside Philadelphia on Sept. 22, Reuters previously reported. Despite the shutdowns, prices of gasoline in New York Harbor were little changed on Monday from the previous session. F4, the dominant RBOB grade in the region, traded at about 0.85 cent per gallon below the gasoline futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange, traders said. Reporting by Stephanie Kelly

2018-09-17,"(Repeats to add pictures) Sept 17 (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp said on Monday that its Brunswick nuclear power plant in North Carolina remained safely shut down despite limited road access to the site due to flooding from storm Florence. The remnants of Florence, which came ashore as a hurricane on Friday, are still dropping heavy amounts of rain on the already waterlogged Carolinas, with officials warning the worst is yet to come as swollen rivers pose a growing threat. Duke spokeswoman Mary Kathryn Green said there was road access to the Brunswick site but it was “limited access.” She said there were about 300 people at the plant. There are usually more than 900 workers. Over the weekend, Duke said that on-site conditions had prohibited the plant staff “from accessing the site via personal vehicles due to flooding of local roads,” according to an unusual event report made available on the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s website on Monday. An unusual event is the lowest of the NRC’s emergency classifications. Joey Ledford, a spokesman for the NRC’s Region 2 office in Atlanta, said the company issued the report because regulations and plant procedures required multiple overland routes to the plant. Ledford said Brunswick never lost access to offsite power and there was no flooding at the plant, which sits about 20 feet (6.1 meters) above sea level. Duke started shutting the two reactors at the 1,870-megawatt plant on Thursday, before the storm hit the coast. One megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes. Brunswick is located about four miles (6.4 km) from the coast, near the town of Southport about 30 miles south of Wilmington, North Carolina. Nuclear plants have procedures that require they shut a safe amount of time before hurricane force winds are expected to reach the site. The two reactors at the plant, which entered service in 1975 and 1977, are of similar design to some of the reactors damaged at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan after an earthquake and tsunami in 2011. Since Fukushima, all U.S. reactors have been upgraded with additional safety equipment, including portable pumps and generators to keep cooling water circulating through the reactor in case the plant loses offsite power. Separately, Duke said on Saturday it released some stormwater that may have come into contact with coal ash from a landfill at the company’s Sutton power plant in Wilmington.

U.S. President Donald Trump said he would announce his latest plan on China tariffs after the markets close. He is expected to level them on about $200 billion of Chinese imports and China has said it would retaliate. A weaker dollar lifted gold prices and the price of most industrial metals slipped as the tit-for-tat dispute has fueled concerns that demand for metals will weaken. Apple and Amazon.com bore the brunt of investor worries about the tariffs, which were on a list unveiled in July that included $200 billion worth of internet technology products, other electronics, printed circuit boards and consumer goods. “Investors are slowly starting to realize that these new tariffs could be extremely disruptive to the supply chain,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York. The trade tiff has yet to be felt in U.S. markets as the tariffs, which now are set at 3.8 percent, may rise to just 10 percent, which most companies can handle in a growing economy, said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at said on Monday he would announce his latest plan on China tariffs after the markets close. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.31 percent while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed up 0.07 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 70.84 points, or 0.27 percent, to 26,083.83. The S&P 500 lost 13.33 points, or 0.46 percent, to 2,891.65 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 90.23 points, or 1.13 percent, to 7,919.82. The dollar’s weakening is a good sign for global markets, especially in emerging markets where the strong dollar has been a cause for concern, Nuveen’s Nick said. The greenback has benefited from safe-haven flows as the U.S.-Chinese trade conflict worsened. The euro and sterling also advanced against the dollar on optimism that Britain would reach a deal with the European Union on the terms of its departure from the bloc. The Spanish government and the EU’s chief negotiator said they would stick to the current calendar that foresees finalizing Brexit negotiations before the European summit in October. The dollar index fell 0.44 percent and the euro rose 0.46 percent to $1.1681. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.18 percent versus the greenback at 111.84 per dollar. U.S. Treasury yields rose across the board on growing expectations the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in September and December, and perhaps at least twice more in 2019. Yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note touched 3.022 percent, the highest level since late May. U.S. 30-year yields also hit a four-month peak of 3.159 percent, while 2-year yields soared to 2.799 percent, the strongest level in 10 years.

2018-09-17,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed on Monday as the market weighed deepening trade tension between the U.S. and China that is expected to dent global crude demand and potential supply tightening due to Iran sanctions.  Brent crude LCOc1 futures dipped 4 cents to settle at $78.05 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell 8 cents to settle at $68.91 a barrel. Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Monday that he expected the United States would soon announce tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. Administration officials said on Saturday that President Donald Trump was likely to announce the new tariffs as early as Monday. “That has the potential to be a demand-killer and that is why the market is trading into the red,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York. U.S. stock indexes broadly fell on Monday, weighing on oil futures, on expectations that the Trump administration would go ahead with the new tariffs and that Beijing would retaliate. Supporting crude futures were potential supply cuts from U.S. sanctions on Iran. Sanctions affecting Iran’s petroleum sector will come into force from Nov. 4.  Iranian crude oil export loadings have declined by 580,000 barrels per day in the past three months, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts said in a note to clients. “We believe that the full effect of the Iranian oil sanctions has yet to be seen and we feel that the next 5-6 week anticipatory phase of the official sanctions will associate with steady speculative buying interest,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. Iran’s oil exports have been falling in recent months as more buyers, including its second-largest buyer India, cut imports ahead of U.S. sanctions that take effect in November. Washington aims to cut Iran’s oil exports down to zero to force Tehran to re-negotiate a nuclear deal. Since spring when the Trump administration said it would impose the sanctions, crude traders have priced in a risk premium reflecting the supply shortages that may occur when exports from Iran, the third-largest OPEC producer, are cut. U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry told Reuters on Friday that he did not expect any price spikes and that Saudi Arabia, the United States and Russia could between them raise global output in the next 18 months. On Monday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said all possible scenarios for oil output could be discussed at a meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC states in Algeria this month. State oil giant Saudi Aramco will spend more than 500 billion riyals ($133 billion) on oil and gas drilling over the next decade, a senior company executive said.

2018-09-17,"FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF, Sept 17 (Reuters) - German utility Uniper is ready to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) into the country and distribute it should a terminal be built at Wilhelmshaven, close to its storage facilities, board member Keith Martin told Reuters in an interview. Martin said the company is in talks with a number of parties including those from the United States and that more concrete news should be announced before the end of the year. Such plans put Uniper in competition with RWE which said earlier this month it had secured capacity to import LNG at a planned terminal in Brunsbuettel, for which a final investment decision would be made next year. “We are in talks with interested parties in building a floating liquefied natural gas import terminal at Wilhelmshaven,” Martin said told Reuters. “We are talking to a wide range of people, including the U.S.” He said he was “confident” that there would be further news about the project in the fourth quarter but that for now, details and third parties were commercially sensitive. Martin’s comments come a week after Uniper first said it favoured the deepwater port on the North Sea coast compared to RWE’s Brunsbuettel project on the Kiel canal. His remarks amount to a hardening of an earlier commitment, and will give suppliers, logistics firms and consumers important clues on where to position themselves. The terminal, a Floating Regasification and Storage Unit (FSRU), would have a throughput capacity of around 10 billion cubic metres a year, or 7.3 million tonnes a year, and accept Q-Max 265,000 cubic metre LNG carriers, Martin said. Uniper would not invest in the terminal itself but it would become the buyer and distributor of the gas, Martin said. Ordering FSRUs rather than building onshore LNG facilities is cheaper, quicker and more flexible as the vessel can be moved to a different location when not needed. New FSRUs cost around $200 to $400 million but tankers converted into FSRUs are even cheaper. Uniper says it favours Wilhelmshaven due to its access to the continental pipeline system and storage facilities such as its own plant at Etzel, giving it advantage over other projects, including another on the inland Elbe river port of Stade. Wilhelmshaven LNG could also offer low-carbon bunker fuel for ships in the German Bay, ahead of limits on heavily polluting ship fuels imposed by the IMO from 2020. The debate about German LNG has flared up recently as the government wants to diversify away from pipeline gas arriving from Russia, Norway and the Netherlands. LNG suppliers including Qatar and the United States have said they are keen on opportunities. Global gas prices have risen sharply and Europe faces a decline in indigenous production.

2018-09-17,"OSLO (Reuters) - Members of Nasdaq’s Nordic commodities exchange have fully replenished vital clearing house contingency funds that were lost last week when a single Norwegian trader defaulted, the exchange operator said. Einar Aas, a derivatives trader who made large bets on the power market, left a 114 million euro ($133 million) hole in the clearing house buffers when his funds ran out, drawing scrutiny from regulators seeking to clarify whether rules were broken. Energy firms and other players on the 166-member market had been given until the end of Monday to cover the loss or face default themselves. “The Member Default Fund now has been recapitalized by 100 percent, or 107 million euros ($125 million),” Nasdaq (NDAQ.O) said in a statement. The company had previously said it would replace the remaining loss of 7 million euros itself. Clearing houses like the one operated by Nasdaq are vital for the stability of markets, acting as an intermediary in stock, bond or derivatives transactions and ensuring completion if one side goes bust. “Finansinspektionen (the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority) is following up on whether Nasdaq Clearing has acted in compliance with current regulation and whether the regulation is sufficient,” the Swedish financial markets regulator said in a statement late on Friday. The clearing house will also hire an external party to review its handling of the case, Nasdaq Clearing Chief Executive Officer Julia Haglind told Reuters. While Aas had bet that Nordic-German spreads would narrow, this backfired on Sept. 10 as heavy rain pushed down prices in the hydroelectric-dependant Nordic region, while a spike in the cost of carbon drove up German prices, Nasdaq said.     In a single day, the difference between Nordic and German power prices for 2019 widened by 5.56 euros, 17 times more than the average daily move and exceeding the maximum level of 4 euros for which Nasdaq Clearing’s risk model had been calibrated. Since 2011, when the current pricing system was set up, the largest change in Nordic-German spreads on any single day had been 1.6 euros, Nasdaq said, calling the Sept. 10 market move “a true ‘Black Swan’ event.”     GRAPHIC: German and Nordic year-ahead power prices - reut.rs/2D3NJHs Nordic power prices continued to fall on Monday due to wet weather and lingering concerns about the default, said Lauri Riihimaki, a trading manager at Finnish energy services company Enegia. Following the default of Aas, Nasdaq’s clearing house on Friday said it would adjust its models and demand bigger capital buffers in order to shift more of the risk from the mutualized default fund to the owners of individual portfolios. “The fact that they are increasing marginal requirements could decrease (market) liquidity,” investor relations manager Maans Holmberg at Finnish power firm Fortum (FORTUM.HE) told Reuters. “But if they didn’t increase them after last week’s event maybe some members would anyway reduce their liquidity as they may be worried about trading safety,” he said. “Lower liquidity could be an outcome of this, it is completely logical. After an incident like this it is normal that you will see an effect on liquidity. And it is unfortunate as we have seen liquidity falling over the years,” he added. Nasdaq on Friday also deposited $22 million in additional funds on a temporary basis to help restore trust in the market, the exchange said. Aas is now barred from trading, and said on Thursday that he risked personal bankruptcy.

2018-09-17,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover (TAMO.NS) said it will go down to a three-day week at its Castle Bromwich plant in central England just days after its boss warned about the impact of Brexit and diesel policy on manufacturing. The Castle Bromwich facility will operate a three-day week from October until the beginning of December in a move which will affect around 1,000 staff but avoid job cuts, a spokeswoman said. “In light of the continuing headwinds impacting the car industry, we are making some temporary adjustments to our production schedules at Castle Bromwich,” the company said in a statement. Last week, the firm’s boss Ralf Speth warned that the wrong Brexit deal could cost tens of thousands of car jobs and risks production at the firm, especially if there are delays at ports and on motorways due to customs checks.  He also said that the government had demonized diesel cars, contributing to 1,000 job losses at the company earlier this year.  Conservative lawmaker and Brexit supporter Bernard Jenkin earlier on Monday accused Speth of “making it up” when asked about the automotive boss’s comments, which included a warning that it was already more attractive to build cars abroad with Brexit adding uncertainty. The Unite union blamed Prime Minister Theresa May as she battles to convince many of her own members of parliament to support her Brexit proposals which she says will maintain frictionless trade and protect jobs, but have angered many Brexiteers.  “This is the continuing effect of the chaotic mismanagement of the Brexit negotiations by the government which has created uncertainty across the UK’s automotive industry and the manufacturing sector generally,” said Assistant General Secretary Tony Burke.  A slump in demand for diesel cars is also having a big impact on the firm.  About 90 percent of Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR) sales in Britain are diesel models, which compares with around 45 percent globally, the company said earlier this year.  Diesel sales have fallen this year nearly 30 percent in Britain, Europe’s second-biggest car market, mirroring similar drops in other major markets, as governments crack down on the segment in the wake of Volkswagen emissions scandal.  JLR said on Monday it was investing to protect its plants in the future. “We have invested more than £4bn since 2010 to future proof manufacturing technologies to deliver new models,” its statement said.

2018-09-17,"(Updates with more details, background) By Asif Shahzad ISLAMABAD, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Pakistan on Monday increased natural gas prices by up to 20 percent, Petroleum Minister Chaudhry Mohammad Sarwar said, in effect slashing consumer subsidies that were a fiscal drag on the government’s budget. Sarwar said the move would help ease part of the 152 billion rupee ($1.24 billion) deficit for state-owned Sui Northern and Sui Southern, the two main suppliers of natural gas that are bleeding cash and subsidising consumers and industries. The decision was taken by the Economic Coordination Committee chaired by new Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has vowed radical economic reforms. “It was a tough decision for us to take,” Sarwar said, adding that the price hike was “10 to 20 percent”, depending on how much gas the user consumed. The new measures would inject “58 billion rupees to stabilise the two companies”, Sarwar added. The price hike is some way off the 46 percent rise recommended by Pakistan’s regulator, which is roughly the increase needed if the gas providers were to break even and de facto subsidies be terminated. Such price rises are politically sensitive in Pakistan, which has enjoyed decades of cheap gas due to its natural resources. However, over the past decade those gas reserves have not been enough and Pakistan experienced a number of shortages until it began importing liquefied natural gas (LNG), which is more expensive than domestic gas. Sarwar said Pakistani consumers would be given relief via a reduction in most taxes on LNG, except a 10 percent sales tax. Pakistan is struggling to avert a currency crisis that could force it to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. The country’s current-account deficit has ballooned in recent years, while the fiscal deficit has shot up to 6.8 percent of the economy in the year that ended June 30.

2018-09-17,"LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell announced on Monday plans to limit leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, across its oil and gas operations as it tries to sharply curb carbon emissions. Shell aims to maintain methane emissions below 0.2 percent of its total oil and gas production by 2025, it said in a statement, joining British rival BP, which last year set a similar goal. Larger rival Exxon Mobil announced in May plans to reduce methane emissions by 15 percent by 2020. Methane is released into the atmosphere mostly from the burning of excess gas, known as flaring, as well as through leaks in gas infrastructure such as wells, pumps and pipelines.  The gas has a bigger greenhouse impact than carbon dioxide, even though the oil and gas industry produces less methane and the gas also has a shorter lifetime. The methane target will be measured against a baseline leak rate, which is currently estimated at range from 0.01 percent to 0.8 percent across the company’s oil and gas assets, it said. The Anglo-Dutch company set out last year an ambitious plan to halve its carbon emissions by 2050, far exceeding rivals. Investors have called on the company to set binding targets to reach those goals. Climate change and emissions, caused by burning fossil fuels, have moved to the forefront of discussions between energy companies and investors since the signing of the 2015 U.N.-backed Paris climate agreement that seeks to curb emissions to zero by the end of the century in order to limit global warming. “The race to near-zero methane emissions is on,” said Ben Ratner, director at Environmental Defense Fund, U.S-based non-profit climate advocacy. “Company leadership on methane does not stop with setting targets. Follow through with good data and transparency are vital.” Shell’s methane emissions reached 123,000 tonnes last year, accounting for around 5 percent of its total greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website.

2018-09-17,"* U.S. likely to announce tariffs on $200 bln in Chinese goods * European shares down after falls in Asia * Dollar slips but currency markets quiet * Oil rebounds on supply concerns * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Updates throughout) By Tommy Wilkes LONDON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Stock markets headed south on Monday as investors took fright at news that Washington was set to announce a new round of tariffs on Chinese goods in the latest escalation of their trade conflict. U.S. President Donald Trump’s expected announcement of new tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods drew an immediate threat of reprisals from Beijing. Trump took to Twitter early on Monday to say: “If countries will not make fair deals with us, they will be “Tariffed!” The growing trade conflict between the world’s two largest economies has long unnerved investors who fear an escalation could eventually whack global growth, while talks between the two countries have failed to make much headway. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell as much as 0.2 percent, while Germany’s DAX, home to large exporters and carmakers, dropped half a percent. France’s CAC 40 and Britain’s FTSE 100 each fell 0.3 percent. Last week, Europe’s STOXX 600 had enjoyed its best weekly gain since July as the Turkish central bank’s interest rate rise brought a broad relief rally, but the mood was less buoyant on Monday. The falls in Europe followed weakness across Asian markets. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 1.2 percent, snapping three straight sessions of gains. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, remains more than 5 percent off its record high touched in January, and down 0.8 percent in September. “On the Chinese side, Mr. Trump has burned a lot of political capital so it’s hard to see how talks can resume if Mr. Trump goes ahead on the $200 billion,” Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum. “China’s scope to retaliate is surprisingly limited, however, especially since the outbreak of swine flu, which will anyway push up CPI inflation,” Beamish said, referring to the deadly swine fever strain that is seen impacting Chinese pork prices. The S&P 500 e-minis fell 0.1 percent, indicating Wall Street would open slightly weaker. Beamish doubted whether the United States would slap 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports, as the Trump administration has said it is considering, and the Wall Street Journal reported the tariff level would probably be about 10 percent. Market watchers reckon further escalation is likely, although some investors think Trump’s tariff threats are largely rhetoric aimed at a domestic audience before the mid-term elections in November. They expect tensions to ease once the vote is out of the way. “I think the market has digested more or less all this rollercoaster with tariffs and I think [Trump is] trying to finish off with this matter until November,” said Dimitrios Stefanopoulos, portfolio manager at Alpha Trust in Greece. The dollar fell on Monday, suggesting investor nervousness was limited. The greenback tends to firm during bouts of trade tension as investors seek safety in the world’s most liquid currency. The greenback index slipped 0.2 percent at 94.725, having bounced from a low of 94.359 at the end of last week as Treasury yields rose. The euro added 0.3 percent to $1.1659 and the yen strengthened 0.1 percent to below 111, with broader foreign exchange moves limited. Emerging market currencies were mostly weaker after a strong run last week following the Turkish central bank’s decision to sharply raise interest rates to shore up confidence in the lira. The lira fell more than one percent to 6.2340 while Russia’s rouble dropped 0.2 percent to 68.17 as the effect of a Russian central bank rate hike on Friday faded. European government bond markets were quiet and yields mostly flat, but Italian yields fell 6-8 basis points amid growing hopes that Italian ministers, who meet later on Monday, will agree a market-friendly 2019 budget. Oil prices rebounded from earlier losses despite assurances from Washington that Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States can raise output fast enough to offset falling supplies from Iran and elsewhere. Brent crude oil rose 0.78 percent to $78.70 a barrel. U.S. light crude was up 0.75 percent at $69.51. Gold traded 0.28 percent higher at $1,197.51 an ounce , but was still some way from last week’s top at $1,212.65.

2018-09-17,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brazil’s state-run oil giant Petróleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA) aims to raise output as much as 10 percent to around 2.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019 and cut net debt by $10 billion (7.62 billion pounds), Chief Financial Officer Rafael Grisolia told Reuters. The world’s most indebted oil company is on course to reduce debt to $69 billion by the end of this year despite falling short of its $21 billion asset sales target, Grisolia told Reuters in an interview in New York late Friday. The firm has significantly reduced its net debt from the $106 billion it had accumulated in 2014 to finance development of massive deepwater Atlantic oil fields. Then, Petrobras lost investor confidence as oil prices fell, a corruption scandal engulfed the company and losses from government fuel subsidies mounted. Petrobras aims to cut net debt by a further $10 billion in 2019 to reach a ratio of 2 times net debt-to-EBITDA, he said. The firm will continue cutting debt until the ratio hits 1-1.5 times, he said, which would put it in line with global oil majors. “If you look at our direct competitors and peers like Chevron, Exxon and BP, we need to look for a more light capital structure,” Grisolia said.  The firm should reach a ratio of 1.5 in 2020 as part of its next five-year business plan, he said, although that would depend on international oil prices and other variables such as foreign exchange rates. Over the next 5-6 years, once the firm had achieved debt restructuring targets, Petrobras may consider foreign investments to facilitate exports of rising output from the development of the prolific deepwater pre-salt fields, he said. The firm may invest in terminals abroad to receive liquefied natural gas (LNG), he said. That would help Brazil export more gas, he added.  Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), BP (BP.L) and Royal Dutch Shell RDSA.L are among firms that plan to invest billions of dollars in developing deepwater Brazilian energy reserves in coming years. Brazil is expected to account for a large share of the rise in global oil and gas output from non-OPEC countries. Oil production is expected to rise by about 8-10 percent next year from about 2.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018, Grisolia said. That should contribute to increased revenue, he added. Crude prices CLc1LCOc1 rallied to three-and-a-half year highs this summer as global supplies tightened, leading to higher fuel prices.  Higher oil prices than the company estimated in its 2018 budget have raised revenue and allowed Petrobras to hit its debt reduction target, he said. That compensated for the $7 billion from asset sales that Petrobras expected to receive this year, he added. The company has already received $5 billion from sales and will receiving another $2 billion before the end of the year, he said. “All the divestment and cash from divestment will help, but we don’t necessarily need them to achieve the target of $69 billion by the end of the year,” he said.  Earlier this year, a nationwide truckers’ protest over rising diesel prices paralysed Latin America’s largest economy and forced the government to lower diesel prices through tax cuts and subsidies. That hurt Petrobras’ share price as investors worried the firm would again lose cash to subsidize fuel sales. The firm expected to receive 2 billion reais to 2.5 billion reais from the country’s oil regulator within two weeks to compensate for subsidies, Grisolia said.     Subsidies have made it less profitable for the private sector to import diesel, he said, but some imports continued and he did not foresee any fuel shortages. “Although the volume of imports to Brazil is lower, they are not zero, they are happening.” he added. “We do recognise that margins are tighter.” Petrobras is running refineries close to maximum capacity and importing some fuel, he said.  Petrobras has a gasoline hedge in place to cushion the impact of fuel price volatility and is considering a diesel hedge. The cost of the hedge was marginal, Grisolia said. Banks that Petrobras typically works with for currency operations were executing the fuel hedge, he said, such as Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Bank of Brazil and Citibank. Petrobras has hosted meetings with economic advisors to presidential candidates ahead of wide-open elections next month. Grisolia said talks had been positive, but declined to say which teams he had met or comment on their strategies. Candidates have different plans for the company and the role of the private sector in energy, bringing some uncertainty to investors.

2018-09-17,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers have remained bullish towards Brent even as the approach of Hurricane Florence turned them against WTI and refined fuels were hit by liquidation. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by 29 million barrels in the week to Sept. 11. The reduction in net length was a notable reversal after portfolio managers had boosted their bullish position by a total of 172 million barrels over the two previous weeks. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2pfLG9I) For the third week running, fund managers added to their net long position in Brent, raising it by another 23 million barrels last week and by a total of 116 million since Aug. 21. But that was more than offset by reductions in NYMEX and ICE WTI (-28 million barrels), U.S. gasoline (-8 million), U.S. heating oil (-6 million) and European gasoil (-11 million). The liquidation of WTI positions is likely to have been encouraged by the approach Hurricane Florence and more generally by the peaking of the tropical cyclone season in the North Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. Florence was already clearly tracking towards the Atlantic coast, an area of net petroleum consumption, where it ultimately made landfall, rather than the production and refining centres on the Gulf Coast. However, concerns about the risk of other storms, coupled with memories of last year’s Hurricane Harvey, which put multiple refineries out of action for several weeks in 2017, appear to have encouraged caution. Rising inventories of both gasoline and middle distillates, after an unusually long and heavy summer refining season, have inspired a similar restraint towards fuels. In contrast, sentiment towards Brent remained positive, as traders focused on the loss of exports from Iran as a result of U.S. sanctions as well as a levelling off in U.S. shale production and strong consumption growth. Fund managers have become more cautious towards the entire petroleum complex since the first quarter, reducing gross long positions across the six contracts to just 1.159 billion barrels, from a peak of 1.625 billion in January. But hedge funds’ short positions remain close to multi-year lows, at just 113 million barrels, suggesting few managers are willing to bet on the possibility of a significant pull back in either crude or fuel prices. Positioning is still lopsided, with fund managers holding 10 bullish long positions for every bearish short position, down from a ratio of almost 14:1 in April but sharply up from just 4:1 a year ago. Overall, the hedge fund community is still anticipating a further rise in oil prices, even as they touch the highest level for almost four years. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

2018-09-17,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain’s Cepsa will sell a stake of about 25 percent in an initial public offering that sources close to the matter expect to value the company at around 10 billion euros ($11.6 billion), making it one of the largest oil company listings in a decade.  The listing, expected in the fourth quarter, will be for a 25 percent stake prior to any greenshoe option whereby more shares could be sold depending on demand, according to the company, owned by Abu Dhabi state investor Mubadala.  The price range and implied market value are still to be decided, Cepsa added in a statement.  A recovery in oil prices in recent months, after a deep sell-off that started in 2014, has analysts expecting an acceleration of public listings of oil and gas companies.  Rothschild is the sole financial adviser of the Cepsa deal, while Banco Santander, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley are acting as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners, Cepsa said. The flotation is subject to market conditions, Mubadala said in a separate statement.  Cepsa will also continue with plans for a private placement of shares that could take place alongside the public share sale, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  Cepsa employs more than 10,200 people and has fields in Latin America, North Africa, southeast Asia and Spain, with a total production of more than 175,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent. The company is also a significant player among European oil refiners, with a processing capacity of 483,000 barrels a day in Spain.       Cepsa set aside more than 1 billion euros for new investments in 2018, its chief executive Pedro Miro told Reuters in an interview in November 2017.   After years of stakebuilding in Cepsa, the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund bought the remaining shares it did not already own from France’s Total (TOTF.PA) in 2011, valuing the Spanish company at around 7.5 billion euros.

2018-09-17,"VIENNA (Reuters) - The U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal struck between Iran and major powers is “doomed” to seriously affect peace and security in the Middle East, Iran’s atomic chief said on Monday. President Donald Trump announced in May that Washington was pulling out of the deal, which lifted international sanctions against Tehran in exchange for restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activities. Many fear the U.S. withdrawal will lead to the deal’s collapse. “As discerned almost unanimously by the international community, this ominous move is doomed to have serious repercussions for the international and regional peace and security,” the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Ali Akbar Salehi, told an annual U.N. nuclear watchdog meeting. Salehi, a veteran negotiator with the West, did not elaborate on what those repercussions might be.  Iranian forces are fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad’s government in Syria, where fighters from Iranian-backed Hezbollah are also deployed. The war in Yemen is also largely seen as a proxy war between Iran and U.S. ally Saudi Arabia. Some U.S. sanctions lifted under the deal have already been put back in place while others are due to resume in November. European powers have scrambled to protect Iranian oil revenues and shield companies from the U.S. measures to keep them operating in Iran, but many firms have pulled out regardless. The sanctions have contributed to a slide in Iran’s currency, the rial, which has lost about two-thirds of its value this year, hitting a record low against the U.S. dollar this month.  “The international community’s opposition to the U.S. withdrawal ... does not nearly reflect the deep anger at the American unilateralism but also the concerns about the extremely difficult situation in our immediate region with all its pervasive chaos and the existing menace of terrorism,” Salehi said in his speech to the IAEA General Conference.

2018-09-17,"(Repeats with no change in text) By Patrick Rucker FAYETTEVILLE, N.C., Sept 16 (Reuters) - Deadly storm Florence’s historic rainfall is testing the best efforts by many North Carolina cities to bolster their defenses against flooding since Hurricane Matthew inundated the eastern part of the state two years ago. Since Matthew, firefighters have been trained in rapid water rescue and are equipped with inflatable boats used to pluck people from raging rivers and streams. More dams have been built on many of the rivers that snake through the state, and improved forecasting tools have made it easier to position rescue teams. In the city of Lumberton, where the Lumber River overflowed its banks following Matthew, the city built a berm, an earthen wall along the riverbank to contain the rising current and prevent a repeat of the 2016 flooding. The berm is intended to supplement a recently completed dam built across the river to allow for a controlled release of the water flow. “We saw what was coming, so we started building a dam to keep that area from breaking through like it did before,” said Bill French, director of emergency services for Lumberton. But on Sunday, the combination of the dam and berm failed to stop the swollen river from climbing beyond its banks as it reached about 24 feet (7.3 m), rising 17 feet (5.2 m) in two days alone. It could get worse, with the river forecast to crest at 25.7 feet (7.8 m) late on Sunday. Using a head start from forecasting of the slow-moving rains, French said the city began running half a dozen pumps to clear water from drainage canals. “When the river gets as high as it is now, you’re kind of limited in what you can do,” he said. Overall, Florence, a onetime hurricane that weakened to a tropical depression by Sunday, is forecast to douse the state with record rainfall from a single storm, surpassing the 24 inches (60 cm) that Hurricane Floyd dropped in 1999. In some spots in the offshore Outer Banks islands, 33 inches (84 cm) of rain were recorded this weekend. DOOR-TO-DOOR WARNINGS In Goldsboro, west of Fayetteville, retailers have moved inventory to higher shelves, learning their lesson two years ago when Matthew’s floodwaters damaged goods. City officials have gone door-to-door warning some residents they need to leave. Similar precautions were taken in Wayne County on the banks of the Neuse River, where a furniture store devastated by Matthew removed all its heavy merchandise before the expected storm. The area is made vulnerable by the flat landscape, said Scott Stevens, the city manager in Goldsboro. “A foot of water doesn’t spread out a foot. It spreads out a 100 feet,” he said. Rivers may fill up even faster now that soil is so storm-slicked and sodden it cannot hold more water, said Drew Coleman, a professor of geological sciences at the University of North Carolina. “It’s not a feasible location for us to do a lot of flood proofing on a large scale,” said Stevens, the Goldsboro city manager. Since Matthew, Goldsboro has trained firefighters in water rescues and equipped them with additional boats, Stevens said, saying the city was “much better prepared with equipment and training to help people.” Federal rescue teams were also positioned before the rivers could rise, with a search-and-rescue team based in Lincoln, Nebraska, joining efforts in Fayetteville to make sure senior citizens were safe ahead of the worst of the flooding. More than 140 people were evacuated from a nursing home in Fayetteville late on Saturday by a rescue team comprised of federal responders, state and local emergency workers, said Maine Johnson, a spokesman for the city of Fayetteville. The worst may be yet to come, said Evan Duffey, a meteorologist at Accuweather in State College, Pennsylvania. “All the water from further upstream takes a little while to get down to them.” The Cape Fear River, with a normal depth of just 2 feet (0.6 m) near Fayetteville, is expected to crest late on Monday at 26 feet (7.9 m), which could upend life in the city of about 200,000 people, still recovering from a costly flood in the aftermath of Matthew two years ago. In towns like Lumberton, which lies just 25 feet (7.6 m) above sea level, even the best preparations cannot protect the entire area, said French, the emergency services manager. “There are some areas that you simply can’t do anything about.” Reporting by Patrick Rucker; Additional reporting by Jessica

A company spokesman said a major supplier, owned by the Gupta family, had cut supplies as it seeks insolvency protection and Eskom was quickly trying to secure new contracts with other companies to ensure it had enough coal. Cash-strapped Eskom is critical to Africa’s most industrialised economy as it supplies more than 90 percent of the country’s power, predominantly by burning coal. It is also one of South Africa’s most indebted state firms. “Out of our 15 coal-fired power stations, 10 of them have less than 20 days. Clearly this is contrary to what the regulator has prescribed,” Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said. Eskom, which is battling to recover from a financial and leadership crisis, said it will transport coal from other power stations to those facing constraints and is in discussions  with 12 coal suppliers to secure coal contracts. “If there is no coal it may hamper our ability going forward, but to avoid it being hampered we are diverting coal from other power stations,” Phasiwe said. The main reason for the coal shortages is that Tegeta Exploration and Resources, a coal-mining firm owned by the Gupta family, has cut supplies to Eskom as it seeks insolvency protection, Phasiwe said.

2018-09-17,"* U.S. likely to announce tariffs on $200 bln in Chinese goods * European shares down after falls in Asia * Dollar slips but currency markets quiet * Oil rebounds on supply concerns * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Tommy Wilkes LONDON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - European share markets followed Asian counterparts lower on Monday as investors took fright at news Washington was set to announce a new round of tariffs on Chinese goods in the latest escalation of their trade conflict. U.S. President Donald Trump’s expected announcement of new tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods drew an immediate threat of reprisals from Beijing. The month-long trade conflict between the world’s two largest economies has rattled investors who fear an escalation will eventually whack global growth, while talks between the two countries have failed to make much headway. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell as much as 0.2, while Germany’s DAX, home to large exporters and carmakers, dropped half a percent. France’s CAC 40 and Britain’s FTSE 100 fell 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent respectively. Europe’s STOXX 600 had last week enjoyed its best weekly gain since July as the Turkish central bank’s interest rate rise brought a broad relief rally, but the mood was less buoyant on Monday. However, after the initial falls there were signs that some investors were ready to look past the dispute, with European markets reducing their losses to trade close to flat by 0830 GMT. Earlier in the day, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 1.2 percent, snapping three straight sessions of gains. World shares remain more than 5 percent off their record highs touched in January, based on the MSCI world equity index , which tracks shares in 47 countries. “On the Chinese side, Mr. Trump has burned a lot of political capital so it’s hard to see how talks can resume if Mr. Trump goes ahead on the $200 billion,” Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum. “China’s scope to retaliate is surprisingly limited however, especially since the outbreak of swine flu, which will anyway push up CPI inflation,” Beamish said, referring to the deadly swine fever strain that is seen impacting Chinese pork prices . Beamish doubted whether the United States would slap 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports, as the Trump administration has said it is considering, and the Wall Street Journal reported the tariff level would probably be about 10 percent. But market watchers reckon further escalation is likely. “China may potentially pull out of trade talks entirely and escalate on the new front of outright export restrictions,” analysts at JPMorgan told clients. “This would of course only inflame the situation further.” In currency markets, the dollar succumbed to some selling pressure, with the greenback index down 0.2 percent at 94.778, having bounced from a low of 94.359 at the end of last week as Treasury yields rose. The euro added 0.3 percent to $1.1650 and the yen strengthened 0.2 percent to 111.86, with broader foreign exchange moves limited. Emerging market currencies were mostly weaker after a strong run last week following the Turkish central bank’s decision to sharply raise interest rates to shore up confidence in the lira. The lira fell 1.1 percent to 6.2369 while Russia’s rouble dropped 0.2 percent to 68.146 as the effect of the Russian central bank rate rise on Friday faded. European government bond markets were quiet and yields mostly flat, but Italian yields fell 6-8 basis points amid growing hopes Italian ministers, who meet later on Monday, will agree a market-friendly 2019 budget. Oil prices rebounded from earlier losses as supply concerns outweighed assurances from Washington that Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States can raise output fast enough to offset falling supplies from Iran and elsewhere. Brent crude oil futures rose 0.27 percent to $78.29 a barrel Gold traded 0.28 percent higher at $1,196.26 an ounce , some way from last week’s top at $1,212.65.

2018-09-17,"LONDON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell announced on Monday plans to limit emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, across its oil and gas operations. Shell aims to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2 percent by 2025, it said in a statement, joining British rival BP, which last year set a similar goal. Methane is released into the atmosphere mostly through leaks in gas infrastructure such as pumps and pipelines. The gas has a bigger impact than carbon dioxide, even though the oil and gas industry produces less methane and the gas also has a shorter lifetime. The methane target will be measured against a baseline leak rate, which is currently estimated at range from 0.01 percent to 0.8 percent across the company’s oil and gas assets, it said. The Anglo-Dutch company set out last year an ambitious plan to halve its carbon emissions by 2050, far exceeding rivals.

2018-09-17,"(Repeats Sept. 14 story; no changes to text) * BP becomes pioneer of West African crude derivatives * Oil major clashes with arch-rival Vitol * Development makes crude more expensive for refiners By Dmitry Zhdannikov, Julia Payne and Amanda Cooper LONDON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Oil major BP has clashed with rival Vitol in the once-languid West African crude market, buying up cargoes and taking a big derivative position that may have raised costs for European refiners. The West African crude market typically sees cargoes of Nigerian and Angolan change hands in back-to-back deals outside the Platts window, a system widely used by the industry to price crude. Pricing agency S&P Global Platts sets key oil benchmarks for the market. New trading opportunities arose from August, when broker Sunrise started the first derivative for Nigeria’s four largest crude oil grades - Bonny Light, Forcados, Qua Iboe and Bonga - mirroring derivatives trading in the North Sea. The derivatives, known as contracts for differences (CFDs), allow traders to bet on whether premiums of the four Nigerian grades versus the Brent benchmark will rise or fall. The CFDs, also known as swaps, can be used to hedge against price fluctuations during the voyage of a physical cargo to a consumer, which can take weeks. But CFDs can also be used to take a speculative position. According to five traders familiar with the developments, who asked not to be named because they are not allowed to speak to the media, BP quietly built a long position of up to 10 million barrels in the African CFDs contracts in August, betting the premium of the grades to Brent will rise in September. Against BP in the paper market were six trading desks, including trading giant Vitol, which took the opposite side of the bet and went short CFDs, betting that African grades’ premiums to Brent would fall, according to trading sources. The paper deals were done on a back-to-back basis with only BP, Vitol and five other companies aware of the developments. BP said it does not comment on trading positions. “However, BP welcomes the introduction of the new West African swap to provide greater transparency and aid price discovery in the West African crude market,” it said on Friday. The trades took place in what has long been a regulatory grey area. London’s Financial Conduct Authority, which does not regulate London trading in the West African crude market, but does oversee the UK Brent crude benchmark, declined to comment. BP does not produce oil in Nigeria and has not been a large trader of Nigerian oil in recent years, although it has bought some cargoes for its refining system. After quietly building its paper position in August, BP launched a flurry of bids on the Platts system in September for physical cargoes of Nigerian oil. BP bid for a total of 22 Nigerian cargoes loading between Sept 3-12, a previously unseen volume in the West African crude market, where a whole month can sometimes go without a single public bid or offer in the Platts window. BP’s bidding activity ushered premiums of the African grades against the Brent benchmark to as high as $1.70 per barrel compared to a premium of $1.20 a barrel in August, when BP was building its CFDs position. A difference of 50 cents per barrel would in theory bring a profit of $5 million on a 10-million-barrel CFD position. The rise in premiums in the physical market made BP a big winner on its long position on the CFDs trade, while Vitol was a loser, according to traders. In reaction, Vitol spent over $500 million to buy seven cargoes outside the Platts system from oil majors Total and Shell, paying premiums above $1.70 per barrel, according to three traders familiar with the developments. The trading house then re-sold the cargoes on the Platts system to BP at premiums ranging between $1.55-$1.75 per barrel, effectively accepting a loss on the physical trade but limiting its losses on the CFD side. “Tensions were running huge between BP and Vitol. It was a high stakes game,” said a trader familiar with the development. Vitol declined to comment on the story. S&P Global Platts said it always ensures bids and offers are firm, performable and tradeable and that its price assessments are reflective of market value. “We have seen a marked increase in the past several weeks of transparent information in the West African crude market,” said Jonty Rushforth, senior director at S&P Global Platts. “Alongside the increase in physical information we have seen a growing derivatives market,” he added. “As the importance of that market globally has grown, we have seen the broader market embrace risk management tools related to it.” Market participants said the main losers from the developments in the West African market will be refiners. Nigerian state oil firm NNPC sets its monthly official selling prices (OSP) to long-term crude buyers, mainly refiners, retroactively and based on prices in the Platts system. “This is very bad from a refiners’ perspective. Every seller is now asking high prices and when they show a cargo, all they say is: “If you don’t buy, we’ll just sell to BP,” said a source with a European refiner.

2018-09-17,"BERLIN, Sept 17 (Reuters) - U.S. companies expect to begin delivering liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Germany in four years at the latest and will challenge Russia which now accounts for 60 percent of German gas imports, the deputy U.S. energy secretary told a German newspaper. “U.S. liquefied natural gas is coming to Germany. The question is not if, but when,” Dan Brouillette told the mass circulation daily Bild in an interview published on Monday. U.S. President Donald Trump in July accused Germany of being a “captive” of Russia due to its energy reliance and urged it to halt work on the $11 billion, Russian-led Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that is to be built in the Baltic Sea. Germany rejects this charge and says it is open to diversifying its energy sources, but says sales will ultimately be determined on economic grounds. Brouilette, who acknowledged U.S. LNG would cost more, said the entry of U.S. suppliers onto the German market would effectively set a price ceiling for Gazprom, the Russian state energy company that leads the Nord Stream 2 consortium, and other suppliers. “Because U.S. LNG is here, Gazprom cannot demand whatever it wants,” Brouillette, who met with German business executives in Berlin last week, told the newspaper. U.S. Ambassador Richard Grenell told the newspaper that Chancellor Angela Merkel had assured Trump personally that Germany wanted to purchase U.S. LNG supplies. The debate about German LNG imports has flared up in recent weeks as operators and the government have shown an interest in diversifying away from pipeline gas arriving from Russia, Norway and the Netherlands. Qatar has also expressed interest in selling LNG to Germany. German firms are considering building an LNG terminal in Germany, as gas demand rises in Europe and the Netherlands, one of Germany’s crucial suppliers which is winding down its giant Groningen field and plans to close it in 2030.

2018-09-17,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will speed up efforts to ensure its wind and solar power sectors can compete without subsidies and achieve “grid price parity” with traditional energy sources like coal, according to new draft guidelines issued by the energy regulator. As it tries to ease its dependence on polluting fossil fuels, China has encouraged renewable manufacturers and developers to drive down costs through technological innovations and economies of scale.  The country aims to phase out power generation subsidies, which have become an increasing burden on the state. China’s regions will make an extra push to provide technological and policy support to the renewables sector in order to ensure they can operate subsidy-free, according to draft guidelines issued by the National Energy Administration (NEA) dated Sept. 13 to the industry and reviewed by Reuters. The guidelines said some regions with cost and market advantages had already “basically achieved price parity” with clean coal-fired power and no longer required subsidies, and others should learn from their experiences.  They also urged local transmission grid companies to provide more support for subsidy-free projects and ensure they have the capacity to distribute all the power generated by wind and solar plants. The draft guidelines were issued for feedback from the industry and it is unclear when they will come into effect.  Solar power generation costs fell 90 percent from 2007 to 2017, and GCL New Energy Holdings, one of China’s biggest clean energy developers, said in late August that grid price parity could happen within a year. “Parity is here already for high price markets,” said Thomas Lapham, chief executive of Asia Clean Capital, which builds rooftop solar projects for major corporations in China. “I don’t think there will be a specific magical date when (parity) is here for all locations,” he said. “It will gradually spread over time as efficiencies continue to improve and prices become more competitive.”           China’s solar sector is still reeling from a decision to cut subsidies and cap new capacity at 30 gigawatts (GW) this year, down from a record 53 GW in 2017, with the government concerned about overcapacity and a growing subsidy backlog. According to the NEA, the government owed around 120 billion yuan ($17.46 billion) in subsidies to solar plants by the middle of this year.  Lapham said the cap on new projects has hurt the industry in the short term, but by making a component supply glut even worse, it has also reduced prices and brought China even closer to grid price parity. “The silver lining may be that we are on more stable ground for 2019 and beyond, even without subsidies,” he said.

Liquidity was thin with Japan on holiday and moves in currencies and bonds were minor. Hong Kong markets opened as normal after a super typhoon brushed the city on its way to landfall in China’s Guangdong, the country’s most populous province. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 1.2 percent, snapping three straight sessions of gains. Shanghai blue chips fell 1.1 percent, while the Hang Seng shed 1.6 percent. EMini futures for the S&P 500 were off 0.2 percent and spreadbetters expect London’s FTSE 100 to open 11 points lower, Frankfurt’s DAX 24 points lower and Paris’ CAC 40 to ease 9 points. U.S. President Donald Trump is likely to announce new tariffs on about $200 billion of Chinese imports as early as Monday, a senior administration official told Reuters. The tariff level will probably be about 10 percent, the Wall Street Journal reported, below the 25 percent the administration had said it was considering. The WSJ also reported Beijing may decline to participate in proposed trade talks with the United States later this month if the Trump administration moves forward with the tariffs. Other officials who advise the country’s leaders are suggesting China impose limits on the sale of parts and supplies needed by U.S. businesses, using “export restraints” to threaten their supply chains. “Further escalation looks very likely in which the rate will likely be raised to 25 percent and more U.S. tariffs threatened, while China may potentially pull out of trade talks entirely and escalate on the new front of outright export restrictions,” wrote analysts at JPMorgan. “This would of course only inflame the situation further.” In currency markets the dollar index was a fraction softer at 94.908, having bounced from a low of 94.359 at the end of last week as Treasury yields rose. The euro held at $1.1630 after retreating from a peak of $1.1721 on Friday, which also marks stiff chart resistance. The dollar was idling at 111.98 yen having run into offers around 112.15/20. In commodity markets, gold was stuck at $1,194.70 an ounce and some way from last week’s top at $1,212.65. Oil prices eased as the Sino-U.S. trade dispute outweighed the risks to supply from upcoming sanctions on Iran. Brent dipped 11 cents to $77.98 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell 10 cents to $68.89.

2018-09-17,"WILMINGTON/WILSON, N.C. (Reuters) - Deadly storm Florence drenched North Carolina with more downpours on Sunday, cutting off the coastal city of Wilmington, damaging tens of thousands of homes and threatening worse flooding as rivers fill to the bursting point. The death toll rose to at least 17.  Florence, a onetime hurricane that weakened to a tropical depression by Sunday, dumped up to 40 inches (100 cm) of rain on parts of North Carolina since Thursday, and continued to produce widespread heavy rain over much of North Carolina and eastern South Carolina, the National Weather Service said. “The storm has never been more dangerous than it is right now,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news conference. Many rivers “are still rising, and are not expected to crest until later today or tomorrow.” Some rivers were not expected to crest until Monday or Tuesday, the National Weather Service said. More than 900 people were rescued from rising floodwaters and 15,000 remained in shelters in the state, Cooper said. Many of those rescues took place on swift boats in Wilmington, a historic coastal city of about 117,000 people on a peninsula between the Cape Fear River and the Atlantic Ocean. Rescue crews negotiated downed trees and power lines to reach stranded residents, Mayor Bill Saffo told WHQR radio. “There are no roads ... that are leading into Wilmington that are passable because of the flooding that is taking place now inland,” Saffo said. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for the area until at least Monday morning and said up to 8 inches (20 cm) more rain could fall in some areas, creating an elevated risk for landslides in Western North Carolina. Officials urged those who had evacuated to stay away.  “Our roads are flooded, there is no access into Wilmington,” New Hanover County Commission Chairman Woody White told a news conference. “We want you home, but you can’t come yet.” In Leland, a low-lying city north of Wilmington, homes and businesses were engulfed by water that rose up to 10 feet (3 metres) over Highway 17, submerging stop signs in what local people called unprecedented flooding. The sheriff’s department and volunteers, including locals and some who came from Texas, rescued stranded residents by boat, extracting families, infants, the elderly and pets.    Gas stations were abandoned and fallen trees made many roads impassable. The whir of generators could be heard throughout the city, a sound not expected to dim soon as crews work to restore power.     In New Bern, a riverfront city near North Carolina’s coast, Bryan Moore and his nephew Logan did exactly what authorities warned against: they left their homes to go swimming in the floodwaters after having spent days at home without electricity or running water. “We were stir-crazy from being inside so long,” Moore said. “Feels great. The water’s really cool. ... We’re just having a good old time out here, enjoying the weather.”        More than 641,000 homes and businesses were without electricity in North and South Carolina and surrounding states, down from a peak of nearly 1 million. Florence set a record in the state for rain from a hurricane, surpassing the previous record of 24 inches (61 cm) set by Hurricane Floyd, which killed 56 people in 1999, said Bryce Link, a meteorologist with private forecasting service DTN Marine Weather.  The storm killed at least 11 people in North Carolina, including a mother and child killed by a falling tree, state officials said. Six people died in South Carolina, including four in car accidents and two from carbon monoxide from a portable generator.  South Carolina’s governor urged anyone in a flood-prone area to evacuate. “Those rivers in North Carolina that have received heavy rainfall are coming our way,” Governor Henry McMaster said during a news conference. “They have not even begun (to crest). But they will. And the question is how high will the water be, and we do not know.”        By Sunday night, Florence’s winds had dropped to about 30 miles per hour (45 kph), the National Hurricane Center said, with some weakening forecast over the next 24 hours before intensifying once again as an extratropical low-pressure centre.The centre of the storm was about 45 miles (70 km) north-northeast of Greenville and moving north at 10 mph (17 kph), the hurricane centre said.
