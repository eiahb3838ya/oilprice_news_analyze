2018-11-29,"(Adds comment from SunPower Corp) By Sheky Espejo and Noe Torres SAN JOSÉ TIPCEH, Mexico, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The Yucatan peninsula, dividing the Gulf of Mexico from the Caribbean, is among Mexico’s top destinations for renewable energy firms thanks to its strong winds and sunny climate. Home to bustling tourist resorts such as Cancun, the area is also a big energy consumer. But some of its Mayan indigenous communities are resisting rapid development of $1.1 billion of renewable energy projects and preparing to fight a plan to build a railway across the peninsula. President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Saturday, wants to fast track the construction of the tourist and freight line. “In the communities, there is concern that their opinion will not be taken into account once again with this project,” said Carlos Escoffié, lawyer for the Collective of Mayan Communities in the Chenes region. In San Jose Tipceh, a town of 500 people surrounded by jungles, indigenous leaders delayed by 18 months a multi-million dollar renewable energy project by U.S.-based solar company SunPower Corp, which planned to begin operations in August. “We are practically selling our families for a little bit of money,” said resident Damián Mugarte, threatening to take the battle to Mexico’s highest court. Indigenous resistance capitalizes on a law passed in the wake of the 1994 Zapatista uprising in southern Mexico that compels the government to consult with indigenous people for projects on their land. But the rules are ambiguous for investors and communities alike. Some experts warn that unless the new government puts in place clear guidelines all sides agree on, the issue has the potential to stall railways, ports, mines and other infrastructure projects. “If not fixed, the problem can become the main obstacle for economic growth,” said Hector Garza of international law firm Ritch Mueller who has advised the current government in developing the legal framework for this process. Rodolfo Salazar, who heads the consultation department for the current government at the Ministry of Energy, said rules put in place had helped resolve some conflicts but acknowledged they were not adequate to win the trust of indigenous populations. Left-leaning Lopez Obrador has pledged to amend the constitution to further reflect the indigenous rights, a move that will force the government and companies to pay more heed to their concerns. That may make it harder to build the Mayan Train, a 1,525-km (948-mile) railway planned in the states of Yucatan, Quintana Roo, Campeche, Tabasco and Chiapas, connecting the rainforest and the beach. It could also spell difficulties for another railway to connect the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, which Lopez Obrador hopes could boost the economy of the poor southern state of Oaxaca. In an effort to win popular backing for the project, Lopez Obrador last week held a national referendum on the Mayan Train and nine other policy initiatives - including an oil refinery in the Gulf of Mexico - as part of his pledge to allow greater popular say in government decision-making during his six-year term. But the referendums have stirred controversy because of low participation rates and opaque monitoring of results. Only around 950,000 people voted in the Nov. 24-25 consultation, representing just 1.1 percent of eligible voters. His first consultation last month called for canceling the construction of a partially built $13 billion airport for Mexico City - sending the peso currency and the stock market sharply lower as investors fretted over how he would manage the economy. Although Lopez Obrador vowed to respect the opinion of towns and villages affected by the Mayan Train, he has also pledged to launch a tender to find a private sector partner for the project soon after he takes office. In Yucatan, activists say that none of the 163 communities through which the train will pass have been provided with information about the project. The fear is that “they will find people close to the government to simulate popular support, something which has happened repeatedly on the peninsula,” said Escoffié, of the Collective of Mayan Communities. Rights groups, including Amnesty International, have highlighted the need for consultations on projects that will drive through some pristine natural habitats and indigenous lands. Lopez Obrador has said that the train project, which he expects to take four years to complete and to cost between $6 billion and $8 billion, will provide a boost to the economy of the five southern states, which remain less developed than the more industrialized north. The train will provide easier access to key tourist sites, like the Mayan coastal ruins at Tulum and the famed complex at Chichen Itza. Lopez Obrador has said much of the project would be paid for with revenues from tourism taxes in coming years. Indigenous communities already oppose almost a dozen projects across Mexico’s southern states awarded in 2016 as part of President Enrique Pena Nieto’s bid to generate more than a third of Mexico’s electricity from renewable energy by 2024. Under existing law, projects are put to a vote which the majority must support for projects to go ahead. But regulations are vague, and communities and international organizations including the United Nations argue that in many cases indigenous peoples have not been consulted properly. The process has caused frustrations for investors. On the Oaxacan coast, an indigenous Zapotec community won a court order to suspend the construction of a wind farm by French state company EDF since April. EDF said the delays jeopardize its investments in Mexico. “How much can we stand?” said Víctor Tamayo, EDF’s regional director in Mexico. “Much of the difficulty we are experiencing is because there are no rules and the federal government is responsible.” In San José Tipceh, SunPower’s investment finally won approval in a consultation. The launch of the massive solar park has been postponed until September 2020. “Every day that passes, there are costs associated,” said Adrien Mallet, director of business development at SunPower in Mexico. However, he said the company was not frustrated by the delay and was focused on strengthening its links with the local community. Many in the impoverished town - where most inhabitants work in agriculture, growing corn, lemons and tangerines - say the park will bring much-needed jobs. “We are barely surviving here,” complained Anastacio Ake, a 62-year-old evangelical pastor, saying he would welcome the money and the solar panels the company has promised to install in homes.

2018-11-29,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street seesawed on Thursday, dragged down late in the day by technology and financial stocks, while the dollar and the U.S. yield curve flattened in the wake of U.S. Federal Reserve news. The Fed released minutes of its latest policy meeting, with almost all of its officials agreeing that another interest rate increase was “likely to be warranted fairly soon,” but also opening debate on when to pause further hikes and how to relay those plans to the public. U.S. stocks had opened lower amid jitters over U.S.-China trade talks. They recovered into positive territory after the Fed minutes but turned negative again late in the day. [.N] The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 27.59 points, or 0.11 percent, to 25,338.84, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 5.99 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,737.8 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 18.51 points, or 0.25 percent, to 7,273.08. Other stock markets were broadly higher. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.29 percent. In Europe, stock gains were driven by the tech, mining and autos sectors, which were worst hit by recent losses. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  rose 0.20 percent.  On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell had said U.S. interest rates were “just below” neutral, less than two months after saying rates were probably “a long way” from that point. Many investors read the remarks as signalling the Fed’s three-year tightening cycle was drawing to a close.  His comments briefly pushed the U.S. 10-year bond yield US10YT=RR below 3 percent, its lowest since mid-September.  The yield, which had risen as high as 3.25 percent this month, inched back to 3.0316 percent. Investors will watch a meeting at which U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are expected to discuss trade at the G20 summit on Saturday. Trump said there was “a long way to go” on tariffs with China and urged companies to build products in the United States to avoid them. “The messaging from the U.S. over the last four weeks has been characteristically erratic,” said David Page, senior economist at AXA Investment Managers. The dollar, which has outperformed bonds and the benchmark S&P 500 stock index this year amid rising interest rates and safe-haven flows triggered by global trade tensions, was flat on Thursday. The dollar index .DXY, tracking it against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.01 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.22 percent to $1.1391. Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2784, down 0.31 percent on the day, after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned a disorderly Brexit could trigger a worse economic downturn for Britain than the financial crisis.

2018-11-29,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lifted its annual blending mandate for advanced biofuels by 15 percent for 2019, while keeping steady the requirement for conventional biofuels like corn-based ethanol, according to an agency document seen by Reuters on Thursday. The mandate includes 4.92 billion gallons for advanced biofuels that can be made from plant and animal waste, an increase from the EPA’s initial proposal in June of 4.88 billion and above the 4.29 billion that had been set for 2018, according to the document.  The requirement for conventional biofuels remains at 15 billion gallons for 2019, on par with 2018 and the same as proposed by the agency in June. The EPA is required to announce formally the biofuel mandate figures, which are closely watched by the rival corn and oil industries, by Friday. Biodiesel blending credits rose 4 cents to trade at 46 cents on the report, before paring gains, two traders said. Under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, first adopted in 2005, oil refiners are required to blend a certain amount of biofuels, as determined by the EPA, into their fuel each year or purchase blending credits from those that do.  The policy has helped farmers by creating a huge market for ethanol and other biofuels, but oil refiners say compliance can cost a fortune.  The new figures confirm the agency has declined requests by the corn industry to reallocate biofuel blending obligations previously waived under the small refinery exemptions program, which has been expanded dramatically under the administration of President Donald Trump. Small refineries can be exempted from the RFS if they prove that complying would cause them financial strain. The powerful corn lobby and top officials in the U.S. Department of Agriculture have complained for months that the expansion of the waiver program since Trump took office threatens demand for ethanol. An EPA official told Reuters earlier this week that the decision not to reallocate waived volumes was due mainly to timing. “The primary reason why we’re not reallocating in this rule is because we have no idea what the volume of SREs (Small Refinery Exemptions) will be for calendar 2019 and we won’t know that late 2019, early 2020,” the official said. The Trump administration has also temporarily put on hold processing of current waiver applications as the EPA and the Department of Energy review the scoring system used to evaluate them, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.  The EPA is still expected to rule on current applications  before the March 31 compliance deadline for the 2018 calendar year. In an interview with Reuters, Bill Wehrum, assistant administrator at the EPA’s Air and Radiation Department, said most applications have not yet been received.  “For calendar year 2018, I think we are only now starting to get applications, and the bulk of them we are not going to see until probably early next year,” he said, but declined to comment on any expected change in the number of waivers granted.  “I am not going to predict what we may or may not do,” he said. “Each waiver decision is based on an individual application filed by an affected entity.” Biofuels industry participants repeated calls on the EPA to not grant too many waivers. “Without a check on abusive EPA waivers, we’ll continue to see plants closing their doors or idling production,” Brooke Coleman, executive director at the Advanced Biofuels Business Council, said. Trump has sought to please the corn lobby with a different tweak to U.S. biofuel policy: In October he directed the EPA to draft a rule allowing year-round sales of higher ethanol gasoline blends called E15 - a product restricted during the summer over concerns it contributes to smog. Wehrum said the agency was on track to finalize the rule before June 1, in time for the 2019 driving season. “We will get it done by then,” he said. “I think there’s a virtual certainty that we’re going to get challenged in court. I think we gave a good legal argument.”  Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk; Additional reporting by Jarrett Renshaw in New York, Editing by David Gregorio, Richard Valdmanis and Leslie Adler",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-biofuels/exclusive-epa-lifts-advanced-biofuel-mandate-for-2019-document-idUKL2N1Y421M,29 Nov 2018,"The U.S. Environmental

2018-11-29,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil reversed course and rose as much as 2 percent on Thursday, after industry sources said Russia had accepted the need to cut production, together with OPEC ahead of its meeting next week. Prices in November were down nearly 22 percent so far, set for the biggest monthly fall since the depths of the financial crisis in 2008.  A steady rise in crude supply from the United States, now the world’s top producer, has pressured prices along with Saudi Arabia’s insistence that it will not cut output on its own to stabilize the market. Brent crude slid early to another 2018 low below $58 a barrel.  Prices rebounded after sources said Russia would consider joining an effort to cut output along with Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.  The Russian Energy Ministry held a meeting with the heads of domestic oil producers on Tuesday, before a gathering in Vienna of OPEC and its allies on Dec. 6-7. “The idea at the meeting was that Russia needs to reduce. The key question is how quickly and by how much,” said one source familiar with the talks between Russian oil firms and the ministry. The market now expects that a cut of 1 million barrels per day would be possible from OPEC and its allies, said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York.  Brent crude futures rose 75 cents, or 1.3 percent, to settle at $59.51 a barrel, after touching an intraday high of $60.37 a barrel. U.S. crude futures rose $1.16, or 2.3 percent, to $51.45 a barrel, having hit a high of $52.20.  Oil retreated from session highs after the U.S. Federal Reserve released minutes of the latest policy meeting showing interest rate hikes are expected soon. The dollar index edged higher against a basket of currencies, pressuring prices of dollar-denominated oil.  Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose country is the world’s second biggest oil producer, said on Wednesday he was in touch with OPEC and ready to continue cooperation on supply if needed, but was satisfied with an oil price of $60. U.S. crude inventories hit their highest in a year, and are now only 80 million barrels below March 2017’s record 535 million barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration. [EIA/S]  U.S. stockpiles were expected to build again in the latest week, traders said, citing data from energy information service Genscape. Crude stockpiles at the Cushing, Oklahoma hub rose 771,924 barrels since Nov. 23, traders said on Thursday, citing a weekly Genscape report.  U.S. oil reserves in 2017 exceeded a 47-year-old record when they increased 6.4 billion barrels, or 19.5 percent, to 39.2 billion barrels, the government said. Investors are looking ahead to the meeting of leaders of the Group of 20 nations (G20), the world’s biggest economies, on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1, with the U.S.-China trade war in focus. “We have seen huge increases in supply and the demand picture is in question. However, we might see some movement on global trade issues at the G20 meeting which starts on Friday,” said Michael McCarthy, chief strategist at CMC Markets and Stockbroking. Anticipation of the meeting may also be driving prices higher, said Kilduff of Again Capital, adding that traders are wary of being short ahead of the meeting.

2018-11-29,"WINNIPEG/TORONTO, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Depressed Canadian oil prices are forcing energy companies to use their shares as a currency to fund acquisitions, but investors have been hard to win over to the strategy. Unusually large price discounts for Canadian crude, due to clogged pipelines, and faltering global prices have made growth hard to realize. Some producers have reduced output and lower cash flow has left consolidation using stock as the main option. Shares of Encana Corp, Baytex Energy Corp and International Petroleum Corp, for examples, each plummeted by double-digits on the days they announced deals to buy rivals with shares. The TSX energy index performed better on those days, although it has been in steep decline since early October. “We’ve been getting shocked with bad news all year, and investors don’t necessarily believe that consolidation is a big enough catalyst to offset all the macro headwinds,” said Kevin Brent, vice-president of investment for BlueSky Equities, which owns shares in Seven Generations Energy and Crescent Point Energy Corp. Canadian oil producers face a dwindling amount of capital willing to invest in the sector, leaving many with a stark choice, said Eric Nuttal, senior portfolio manager at Ninepoint Partners, which owns shares in MEG Energy, Baytex and Athabasca Oil. “Do you increase in scale and get your market cap above $1 billion to get on the radar screen? Or do you just throw in the towel?” Many are scaling up. The result, Nuttall said, will likely be more deals into early 2019, and a shrinking number of small-cap Canadian oil producers in the long term. The Canadian oil patch has made 29 deals so far in the second half, worth $9.5 billion, the busiest half-year period for deals since the first half of 2017, according to Cormark Securities data. Further deals may have to rely on shares and private equity, said Andy Mah, CEO of Advantage Oil & Gas. “When you get into a period of such volatility, I think any kind of M&A is very difficult because revenues are certainly challenged.” Shareholders are mainly interested in companies that pay dividends or buy back shares, said Cormark analyst Amir Arif. “It’s almost like you can’t win if you’re a Canadian energy company,” said Janan Paskaran, a partner at Torys LLP who provides M&A advice to energy companies. “It’s hard to invest within Canada, and it’s tough to get investor support when you expand outside.” “People are saying, ‘let’s not spend any capital.’” On Tuesday, Trinidad Drilling shareholders rejected a friendly stock deal to sell to Precision Drilling Corp , choosing instead the certainty of a cash offer from Ensign Energy Services. Swiss-based IPC’s shares have traded more in line with the industry since the steep sell-off last month when it announced its purchase of BlackPearl Resources, and investors generally support the deal, said CEO Mike Nicholson. “We’re now well positioned for the recovery over the next two to three years,” Nicholson said in an interview from Geneva. “Should we start to see (Canadian) pipelines and crude-by-rail improve, I think there’s a huge amount of upside now in our share price.” (Reporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg, Manitoba and John Tilak in Toronto Editing by Phil Berlowitz)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/canada-crude-ma/canadian-oil-producers-trade-shares-for-growth-but-investors-hard-to-impress-idUKL2N1Y41T8,29 Nov 2018,"Depressed Canadian oil

2018-11-29,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - India’s Vedanta Resources VDNRF.PK wants U.S. oilfield services companies to set up consortia to help develop the 41 blocks in India acquired this year by its Cairn Oil & Gas unit, the company’s chairman said on Thursday. Vedanta Chairman Anil Agarwal and Cairn Chief Executive Sudhir Mathur met with executives from 70 services companies this week in Houston to encourage the firms to organise consortia to compete for contracts, Agarwal said in a briefing. “They’re very encouraged by the 41 blocks and they’re looking to work together,” Agarwal said.  The company won 41 of the 55 blocks auctioned under India’s first licensing round for small discovered fields earlier this year. It expects the blocks will eventually produce 500,000 barrels per day of oil equivalent, said Mathur.      Some of the acquired blocks are near existing Cairn fields and could be producing as early as 12 months to 18 months after contracts are awarded, he said.   Vedanta hopes to receive offers from companies including Schlumberger NV (SLB.N), Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and General Electric’s Baker Hughes (BHGE.N) by the first quarter of next year, he said.  Vedanta hopes to speed up development of the blocks by getting the oilfield firms to organise consortia that would deliver integrated services. It is hoping to get “at least four” groups to submit bids and will offer incentives to the consortia that can beat production targets, he said.  “If we have one unified team, the decision-making can be faster,” said Mathur. “It will be better to work in a joint fashion.”  Reporting by Gary McWilliams; Editing by Dan Grebler and Marguerita Choy",https://uk.reuters.com/article/vedanta-resource-oil-services/update-1-vedanta-seeks-u-s-oil-services-consortium-for-new-india-blocks-idUKL2N1Y41HO,29 Nov 2018,"India's Vedanta Resources

2018-11-29,"PARIS (Reuters) - A week-long strike in the French oil sector that mostly disrupted oil and gas major Total’s (TOTF.PA) refineries and depot has been suspended, hard-left trade union CGT said on Thursday. The trade union had called the strike in a dispute over salaries and bonuses. The action had led to a suspension of production at Total’s 253,000 barrel-per-day Gonfreville refinery in Normandy. Output was also curbed at its Feyzin and Grandpuits refineries, while deliveries of refined products were blocked. Deliveries from its La Mede and Flanders depots were also blocked. CGT spokesman Thierry Defresne said union members have made a decision to suspend the strike as of Thursday evening. He said the union will wait for December 11 when annual salary negotiations start at the company to ask members if they are happy with proposals made by management. A spokeswoman for Total confirmed the suspension of the strike but gave no further details. Patrick Pouyanne, Total’s chief executive, tweeted earlier on Thursday that he met with workers at the Feyzin refinery and reassured them about their bonuses. Defresne said that although Pouyanne’s reassurances were heard by the workers, there was nothing binding.

2018-11-29,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump sent mixed signals on Thursday about the prospects for a trade deal with China, saying an agreement was close but he was not sure he wanted one, just as he left for Argentina for a meeting with President Xi Jinping. “I think we’re very close to doing something with China but I don’t know that I want to do it,” Trump told reporters as he left the White House to fly to the G20 summit in Buenos Aires. “Because what we have right now is billions and billions of dollars coming into the United States in the form of tariffs or taxes,” he said. Trump and Xi are scheduled to meet on Saturday to discuss trade amid increasing tensions between the world’s top two economies. Peter Navarro, Trump’s hardline trade adviser, will attend the meeting between the leaders, a U.S. official told Reuters. Another official said Navarro’s addition was meant to send a message to China about the administration’s resolve on trade. Navarro has advocated a tough stance against Beijing. U.S. companies and consumers are bearing part of the cost of the U.S. tariffs on China by paying higher prices for goods, and investors have cheered when the prospects for a deal have improved. U.S. stocks fell on Thursday amid uncertainty over the outcome of the talks.  “I really don’t know but I will tell you that I think China  wants to make a deal. I’m open to making a deal. But frankly, I like the deal we have right now,” Trump said. China, for its part, is hoping for “positive results” in resolving its trade dispute with the United States, the commerce ministry said on Thursday.  Asked if China was seeking to prevent the imposition of additional U.S. tariffs at the meeting, the ministry’s spokesman, Gao Feng, said economic teams from both nations were in contact to implement a “consensus” reached by Trump and Xi during a phone call this month. “I hope that the United States and China could move towards each other and work hard to achieve positive results in the meeting,” Gao said without elaborating. The United States has levied additional duties of between 10 percent and 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese goods this year as punishment for what it calls China’s unfair trade practices, with the 10 percent tariffs set to climb to 25 percent next year. A Reuters poll on Wednesday showed China’s factories likely struggled to grow for a second straight month in November as cooling demand at home and the threat of higher U.S. tariffs stifled new orders. “The Chinese side has repeatedly stressed that the essence of Sino-U.S. economic and trade cooperation is about mutual benefit and win-win,” Gao said. White House officials said this week Trump was open to making a trade deal with Xi when they meet. Trump, whose economic record is likely to be a key factor in his race for re-election in 2020, lashed out at General Motors Co after the company's recent announcement of U.S. layoffs and plant closures and threatened additional tariffs. (bit.ly/2SjZrRk) (reut.rs/2E4J33Z) In a Twitter post on Thursday, Trump said: “Billions of Dollars are pouring into the coffers of the U.S.A. because of the Tariffs being charged to China, and there is a long way to go.

2018-11-29,"Nov 29 (Reuters) - Energy Transfer LP representatives are heading to Pennsylvania’s capital on Thursday for a hearing before utility regulators to defend the company’s plan to put the Sunoco Mariner East 2 natural gas liquids pipe into service by year end. Energy Transfer wants to temporarily connect an existing 1930s-era 12-inch (30.5 centimeter) pipe to the parts of its long-delayed 20-inch Mariner East 2 pipeline that it has already completed so it can start transporting liquids for customers. Those customers have been waiting for more than a year to ship liquids on Mariner East 2. When Energy Transfer first started working on the $2.5 billion project in February 2017, it had planned to put the 350-mile (563-kilometer) pipe into service in the third quarter of 2017. Mariner East 2 and another Energy Transfer project, the Rover natural gas pipe from Ohio to Michigan, were delayed over the past year in part because the projects together racked up more than 800 state and federal permit violations while the company raced to build them. Those opposed to Energy Transfer’s plans for Mariner East 2 asked the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) to stop construction on Mariner East 2 and also stop the company from transporting liquids on the existing Mariner East 1 pipeline. The administrative law judge at the PUC scheduled to hear the case on Thursday is Elizabeth Barnes, the same judge who heard a case earlier this year that sought to stop the Mariner East project. In that case, Judge Barnes ordered Energy Transfer to stop transporting gas on Mariner East 1 and stop work on Mariner East 2 in West Whiteland Township after sinkholes were discovered near the pipeline. Mariner East 1 returned to service in June. In the latest case, seven residents of Delaware and Chester Counties in southeast Pennsylvania argued Energy Transfer did “not provide adequate notice of procedures sufficient to ensure the safety of the public in the event of a leak or rupture.” In response, Energy Transfer spokeswoman Lisa Dillinger said in an email “We do not believe the claim is valid...The integrity of our Mariner East 1 and 2 pipelines has been verified in the last few months” by state and federal regulators. Mariner East transports liquids from the Marcellus and Utica shale fields in western Pennsylvania to customers in the state and elsewhere, including international exports from Energy Transfer’s Marcus Hook complex near Philadelphia.

2018-11-29,"* Wall Street dips after Trump says “long way to go” on trade * Investors cautious on trade before Trump-Xi G20 meeting * Sterling falls after Brexit warning * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Changes byline, dateline previous LONDON; recasts with Wall Street open; updates throughout) By Hilary Russ NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - World shares were mixed, with Wall Street edging lower on Thursday amid jitters over U.S.-China trade talks, while the dollar and Treasury yields softened after investors digested recent comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Powell said on Wednesday U.S. interest rates were “just below” neutral, less than two months after saying rates were probably “a long way” from that point. Many investors read the remarks as signalling the Fed’s three-year tightening cycle was drawing to a close. His comments briefly pushed the U.S. 10-year bond yield below the psychologically key 3 percent level earlier on Thursday, its lowest since mid-September. The yield, which had risen as high as 3.25 percent earlier this month, inched back to 3.0152 percent, from 3.044 percent late on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 154.99 points, or 0.61 percent, to 25,211.44, the S&P 500 lost 19.06 points, or 0.69 percent, to 2,724.73 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 59.01 points, or 0.81 percent, to 7,232.58. Other stock markets were broadly higher, with MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe adding 0.23 percent. In Europe, stock gains were driven by the tech, mining and autos sectors, which were the worst hit by recent losses. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.11 percent. Market participants are closely watching a meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G20 summit on Saturday at which the leaders are expected to discuss trade. Trump said on Thursday there was “a long way to go” on tariffs with China and urged companies to build products in the United States to avoid them. “The messaging from the U.S. over the last four weeks has been characteristically erratic,” said David Page, senior economist at AXA Investment Managers. Thursday’s Wall Street dip comes a day after all three major indexes had rallied to close more than 2 percent higher following Powell’s remarks. The dollar, which has outperformed bonds and the benchmark S&P 500 stock index this year amid rising interest rates and safe-haven flows triggered by global trade tensions, fell back. The dollar index, tracking it against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.04 percent, with the euro up 0.22 percent to $1.1391. Sterling was last trading at $1.2785, down 0.30 percent on the day, after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned a disorderly Brexit could trigger a worse economic downturn for Britain than the financial crisis. In commodities, oil prices rose after sources said Russia had accepted the need for cuts in production together with OPEC. U.S. crude rose 2.11 percent to $51.35 per barrel and Brent was at $59.54, up 1.33 percent. Italy’s borrowing costs slipped, with 10-year yields dipping around 2 bps. A bond auction enjoyed much better buying interest than at last week’s deal targeting retail investors as the government has shown signs it could compromise with the European Union on its budget deficit target.

2018-11-29,"BEAUVAIS, France (Reuters) - Hunched over a burning oil drum on a traffic island, protesters in yellow vests line up to decry France’s punishing fuel taxes and spiralling living costs, blaming a president who they see as detached from the everyday struggles of life outside the city. For two weeks, the anti-diesel tax protests have played out at roadblocks across France, and even on Paris’s Champs Elysees, representing one of the biggest and most-sustained challenges to Emmanuel Macron’s authority since his election last year. The unyielding initial response from the 40-year-old president, a former investment banker, has only reinforced a view among the hard-pressed middle-class and blue-collar workers that he is part of an urban elite contemptuous of their world. Nowhere is that more keenly felt than in small villages, commuter towns and new-build city outskirts, where Macron’s move to scrap a wealth tax, increase a social welfare levy and raise fuel duties has deepened a sense of marginalisation.    “In France, there’s always existed a divide between the big cities and outlying areas. But these days the gulf is growing wider and wider,” protester Stephan Hirelle said. Macron’s 2017 election win upended French politics, bringing to office a political outsider who promised an alienated electorate that his administration would reconnect with the grassroots, create jobs and revive the economy. A year and a half on, it is a similar vein of anti-establishment anger spurring the yellow vests, a spontaneous protest movement that caught Macron off-guard and could spell trouble for his ambitions in next year’s European elections. Diesel pump prices may have been the trigger, but the protests — in which adherents don the high-vis jackets all French motorists must carry — have tapped deeper grievances.  Hirelle and his comrades, who count among them a truck driver, pensioners and blue collar workers, bemoan the decline of French industry, the government’s failure to protect local jobs from China’s clout, and what they see as the selfish interests of the political elite.  Similar resentments helped propel U.S. President Donald Trump to power and have underpinned populists across Europe.    The unrest has pushed Macron’s approval ratings to record lows of barely 20 percent. In surveys, he trails far-right leader Marine Le Pen ahead of next May’s European vote. “There’s a total disconnect between him and us,” said Jean-Marie Camus as trucks and passing cars blared their horns in support. “What he says counts for nothing. Taxes keep going up. Essentially, it’s a declaration of war.” Camus and his comrades are hunkered down on a traffic island sandwiched between a motorway toll station and an out-of-town commercial centre that sprawls along a 1 km strip on the outskirts of Beauvais, a town 75 km (45 miles) north of Paris that is a base for low-cost airline Ryanair. In a scene repeated across France, the area’s hypermarkets and fast-food restaurants have fuelled the demise of artisan businesses in villages that abut new-build estates. Public transport is often scant. The car is king, and costly to run. Macron has long struggled to shake off the tag of “president of the rich” and the view that he is out of touch. He has successfully stared down protests over reforms to the labour code, the state railways and pension system that were orchestrated by trade unions and his opponents. But the yellow vest rebellion, which enjoys broad public support, risks being far more dangerous for the president.      On Tuesday he sought to dampen the protesters’ anger, offering talks between his government and their representatives.  The next round of fuel tax hikes — which he says are necessary to fight climate change — will go ahead in January, but he gave himself room to back down later, proposing a quarterly review of pump prices to ensure the tax is “fair”.  “I hear the people’s discontent,” he said. “I will not allow our energy transition plan to deepen the inequalities between regions and make the lives of citizens in rural areas and peri-urban areas even more difficult.” Protesters on the barricades were unimpressed. Their impression of Macron has been cemented.  On Wednesday, the Jean-Jaures Foundation, a left-leaning think-tank, published a report backing the sentiments driving the yellow-vest movement — French households are finding it tougher to make ends meet, the report said, with basic pastimes such as trips to the cinema and restaurants out of reach. “Having to sacrifice such simple pleasures sends a message to these people that they are slowly falling off the bottom of the vast middle class rung,” the authors wrote.          For now, the protest movement shows no sign of abating. Another rally is planned for Paris on Saturday, a week after hundreds of protesters clashed with riot police in the capital.  Equally worrying for Macron are signs that public support for the “gilets jaunes” is wide and growing, with three-quarters of people backing the movement, according to an Elabe poll published on Wednesday.  “There has always been a two-speed France,” said Thierry Gregoire, speaking at a cafe in central Beauvais where patrons nursed morning glasses of beer. “It’s just Macron has accelerated the split.”  Reporting by Richard Lough; Editing by Alison Williams",https://uk.reuters.com/article/france-protests-divide/rpt-fractured-france-diesel-tax-protests-expose-macrons-achilles-heel-idUKL8N1Y44Q4,29 Nov 2018,"* Protesters see Macron as part of out-of-touch urban

2018-11-29,"Nov 29 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil and natural gas proved reserves rose to record highs in 2017, driven by stronger energy prices and the continuing development of shale formations, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Thursday. Crude reserves increased 6.4 billion barrels, or 19.5 percent, to 39.2 billion barrels at year-end 2017, marginally higher than the previous record of 39 billion barrels set in 1970. “Total U.S. oil reserves in 2017 exceeded a brief, one-year, 47-year-old record, highlighting the importance of crude oil development in shales and low permeability plays, mainly in the Southwest,” the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy said. Natural gas reserves jumped 123.2 trillion cubic feet (tcf), or 36.1 percent, to 464.3 tcf last year. The previous record was 388.8 tcf, marked in 2014. The new record for natural gas extends a longer-term trend of development, mainly in shale plays in the northeast, the EIA said. Reserves of both oil and gas were about double their levels from a decade ago. The agency said these new proved reserves records were established in 2017 despite crude production at levels not seen since 1972, and record natural gas output.

2018-11-29,"* Once-promising looking nuclear technology now in question * ASTRID reactor could be radically downsized (Adds CEA comment, detail) TOKYO/PARIS, Nov 29 (Reuters) - France’s state-run nuclear agency said on Thursday it had presented options on a new generation of fast-breeder nuclear reactors to the French government and talks were underway but dismissed reports in Japan that it had taken a decision. The Nikkei business daily reported that France had informed Japan it would halt research into the ASTRID (Advanced Sodium Technological Reactor for Industrial Demonstration) project in 2019, with no plans to allocate a budget from 2020. A spokesman for the CEA nuclear agency said one option it had discussed was to reduce ASTRID’s capacity to a 100-200 megawatt (MW) research model from the commercial-sized 600 MW originally planned. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Thursday he had not been informed about any French plans to freeze the project and that nothing has been decided. In 2016, after decades of development, Japan pulled the plug on its own $8.5 billion Monju prototype fast-breeder project. The ASTRID sodium-cooled reactor is one of several new ""fourth-generation"" designs that could succeed the pressurised water reactors that drive most of the world's nuclear plants. tinyurl.com/y84d2hvc Instead of water, they use liquid sodium as a coolant. But sodium burns on contact with air and explodes when plunged into water. An earlier French model was scrapped in the 1980s after have encountering major technical problems. Russia is the only nation to have working breeder reactors, which can burn spent uranium fuel, plutonium and other nuclear waste products. In theory, breeders could turn utility EDF’s nuclear waste into fuel and make France self-sufficient in energy for decades. Their potential is part of the reason why France recycles spent fuel from EDF’s reactors, separating out plutonium in state-owned Orano’s reprocessing plant in La Hague. “The likely abandoning of ASTRID should entail the rethink of the entire spent-fuel management scheme,” World Nuclear Industry Status Report author Mycle Schneider. In 2010, the ASTRID project was granted a 652 million euro ($742 million) budget. Media reports have estimated France has budgeted up to 900 million euros through to 2019 for ASTRID. President Emmanuel Macron said this week that nuclear will remain a key part of France’s power supply and that research in the field must be continued, but he did not mention ASTRID.

2018-11-29,"NIKISZOWIEC, Poland (Reuters) - When the Wieczorek mine, one of the oldest coal mines in Poland, closed in March, Grzegorz Chudy noticed for the first time the neighborhood was vibrant with trees in the full bloom of spring. The smell was heady. “It was incredible. You never knew all those trees were there,” he told Reuters in his art studio in a housing estate for mining families in the southwestern Polish city of Katowice.  “The smell wasn’t there while coal was being transported on trucks. The dust covered it up.” The Wieczorek mine in Katowice, with its towering brick shaft, is among dozens closing down throughout Poland, home to one of the most polluted coal mining regions in Europe. (To see picture package, click on reut.rs/2E7wPaO) From Sunday, Katowice will host a round of United Nations climate talks, at which nearly 200 countries will attempt to agree rules on how to shift the world economy from fossil fuels to try to curb rising temperatures.  The meeting comes as the World Meteorological Organization warned on Thursday that global temperatures were on course to rise by 3-5 degrees Celsius (5.4-9.0 degrees Fahrenheit) this century, overshooting a global target of limiting the increase to 2C. Reaching agreement on how to implement ambitious fossil fuel cuts at the talks could be tough given fears over the impact on industry which have divided the European Union and trade tensions between the United States and China. Poland has painful experience of the difficulty of an economic transition from coal and even as it counts down to Sunday, it announced plans for a new coal mine in the south of the country. Its government drew support in part from those with an emotional attachment to the job security, social fabric and national pride associated with mining that overlooked the downside for health and the planet. The issue resonates especially with older Poles who remember deadly anti-communist protests in the early 1980s when the miners emerged as heroes. Chudy, 36, whose paintings often depict the life and architecture of Nikiszowiec, is one of hundreds of people who have moved to the area, drawn by its industrial feel and affordable housing.  Built to house the families of miners at the start of the 20th century, Nikiszowiec was designed as a self-sufficient neighborhood with its own communal bread ovens and pigsties, as well as a bath house for miners and laundry and mangle facilities.  In the years after communist rule ended in Poland in 1989 and the mining sector started to shrink, the area became notorious for crime and poverty.  Such problems have all but disappeared as the area has become gentrified and the bold decision to hold the climate talks in the region could also help to shift opinions. Those in the artistic community say their work could only exist with the inspiration provided by decades of mining. “For me using coal in a different way than it used to be, which was energy, shows its completely new face, so we can call it our new, cool black gold,” Katarzyna Depa, who makes jewelry from coal, said. But for those with mining in the blood, moving on is harder and the smell of coal dust is as sweet as blossom. Above all they miss the community spirit even if it meant shared danger and hardship. “The atmosphere used to be much better,” miner Krzysztof Zawisza said. “On Friday or Saturday evening people were coming out to sit on the banks, drink some beer, have a barbecue. Now I do not know most of those who have come here.” (This story fixes typo in paragraph 7) Additional reporting by Kacper Pempel and Karol Witenberg; editing by Justyna Pawlak/Barbara Lewis and Emelia Sithole-Matarise",https://uk.reuters.com/article/climate-change-accord-nikiszowiec/refile-wider-image-farewell-to-coal-a-polish-city-wakes-up-and-smells-the-blossom-idUKL8N1Y42QW,29 Nov 2018,"* Poland hosts U.N.climate talks in Katowice, heart of coal

2018-11-29,"LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, must play a bad hand of cards as well as he can at next week’s meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers in Vienna. Falih’s challenge is to get other countries on board with output cuts to avert another crash in oil prices next year while disguising the kingdom’s diminishing leverage in the oil market. Front-month Brent futures have fallen by a third since the start of October while the six-month calendar spread is in contango, indicating most traders expect the market to be oversupplied in 2019. The market outlook is strikingly similar to 2014, with production from U.S. shale surging while consumption growth slows as the global economy falters. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2RjBrxq) But in one respect the situation is even more uncomfortable because Saudi Arabia’s official foreign reserves are down to just over $500 billion, from almost $750 billion in June 2014. The kingdom probably needs to keep several hundred billion dollars’ worth of reserve assets on hand to maintain confidence in its fixed exchange-rate peg to the U.S. dollar and prevent a run on the currency. The kingdom can ill-afford another slump in oil revenues so soon after the last one, which suggests it will have to cut production, while trying to cajole other OPEC and non-OPEC countries to share the burden. At the same time, any cuts must avoid provoking a political reaction from the United States, where the president has continued to press for even lower oil prices. Saudi Arabia faces a familiar but uncomfortable choice: cut production to defend prices or allow prices to fall to protect market share. In November 2014, Saudi Arabia chose to maintain production and allow prices to fall, which temporarily halted the U.S. shale boom but wrecked the kingdom’s finances and pushed its economy into recession. In December 2016, Saudi Arabia opted to cut production, which boosted prices and stabilised the kingdom’s finances and economy but also revived the shale boom and cost it oil-market share. The 2014 market-share strategy, associated with Falih’s predecessor as oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, is often characterised as a failure, though it did manage to restrain U.S. shale production for a time. By contrast, the price-defence strategy of 2016, involving coordinated output cuts with other OPEC and non-OPEC countries, has been hailed as a triumph, even though it reinvigorated the shale boom. But Naimi warned repeatedly that the burden of OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts would fall most heavily on Saudi Arabia and the main beneficiaries would be U.S. shale producers, and time has proved him correct. Saudi Arabia shouldered a disproportionate share of the cuts in 2017/18, just as it had done during earlier cuts in 2008/09 and 2003/04. Russia’s production was broadly unchanged or increased during all three episodes. By August 2018, Saudi Arabia’s production was up by 630,000 barrels per day compared with June 2014 and Russia’s output had climbed by 525,000 bpd. U.S. output was up by more than 2.6 million bpd. In the current environment, the kingdom must do everything possible to prevent another price crash, which means it has little option but to cut its own production significantly. Saudi Arabia cannot afford another slump in oil prices. It needs to keep revenues high to help its economy climb out of recession and finance ambitious social and economic transformation programmes. Now the kingdom is trying to assemble some diplomatic cover for cutbacks it will almost certainly have to make anyway. In the run-up to next week’s meetings in Vienna, Falih has indicated Saudi Arabia is ready to cut output again but only in conjunction with other producers (“Saudi Arabia wants united front on oil output”, Reuters, Nov. 28). “We are going to ... do whatever is necessary, but only if we act together as a group of 25,” Falih told reporters, referring to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies. “As Saudi Arabia we cannot do it alone, we will not do it alone. “Everybody is longing (to) reach a decision that brings stability back to the market ... I think people know that leaving the market to its own devices with no clarity and no collective decision to balance the market is not helping.” If the past is any guide, however, Saudi Arabia will do most of the cutting, Russia’s output will end up little changed, and the main beneficiaries will be U.S. shale firms. Saudi Arabia’s fundamental problem is structural rather than diplomatic: every time the kingdom tries to raise prices by restricting its output, it only encourages more increases in U.S. shale production.

2018-11-29,"(Adds TechnoProm reaction, background) MUNICH/MOSCOW, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Prosecutors are investigating three German Siemens employees based in St. Petersburg over allegations they violated EU embargo rules, the Hamburg public prosecutor’s office said. Siemens sold seven gas turbines to Russia in 2015 and 2016, but four of them were later installed in Russia-annexed Crimea, which is subject to sanctions from the European Union. The bloc imposed sanctions after Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula from Kiev in March, 2014, and ratcheted them up as Moscow went on to back rebels fighting against government troops in east Ukraine. Siemens said in its annual report published on Wednesday that it was fully cooperating with the authorities. While Siemens had agreed to sell 7 turbines, only 4 were delivered, an option for a further 3 turbines was never drawn. The turbines order was worth 213 million euros and the investigation had been going on since May, a spokesman for the prosecutor said. Siemens said that the turbines were ordered and delivered for a power plant project in Taman in southern Russia. But they were then transferred to Crimea by Siemens’ Russian customer OAO VO TechnoPromExport and installed in new gas-fired power plants in a breach of the sales contract. OAO VO TechnoPromExport declined to comment. Siemens sued OAO VO TechnoPromExport in Russia to get the sales contract cencelled. But its case was dismissed by four consecutive courts, Siemens said.

2018-11-29,"SOFIA (Reuters) - Miners and workers at Bulgaria’s largest coal-fired power plant Maritsa East 2 marched in Sofia on Thursday to protect their jobs and to urge the government to support coal-fired energy production in the Balkan country. More than 1,000 people urged the government to guarantee it would not shut mines and power plants at Maritsa East lignite coal complex in southern Bulgaria, despite a European Union push to decarbonise the bloc’s economy by 2050. “It looks like they may start closing units one by one, because of the convention that forces us to cut the harmful emissions,” said Katia Vassileva, 45, a worker at Maritsa East 2, adding that Bulgaria was having to pay a heavy price to buy the carbon permits to make up for emissions from the plant. A spike in the price of European carbon permits has widened financial losses of the state-owned 1,620 megawatt Maritsa East 2, increasing workers’ fears of eventual closure. They say any move to shut the plant could cause power shortages or a spike in power prices. Coal-fired plants produce more than 40 percent of Bulgaria’s electricity. The government has said it would work to ensure they continued to operate. Bulgaria’s two major trade unions say the European Commission has set a pace for creating a greener economy that was too fast and too costly for the Balkan country. “We need to find a solution, because it is not fair for the poorer countries,” said Vladimir Topalov, head of the miners federation at Podkrepa trade unions.  Some 20,000 people work in Maritsa East complex, whose lignite coal deposits are rich in sulfur that is blamed for damaging air quality and causing respiratory diseases when released into the atmosphere.  Trade unions say the mine complex provides livelihoods for more than 100,000 people in the European Union’s poorest member. The government has appealed against a European Commission decision to impose stricter limits on pollutants from coal-fired plants. Maritsa East 2 was the first coal-fired plant to be given an exemption from new EU pollution limits.  Bulgaria has said it would not back more ambitious goals to cut greenhouse gases at the United Nations climate conference that opens on Sunday in Poland. “Bulgaria cannot allow itself to lose competitiveness in the energy sector and will work to defend the social right of the people working in it,” President Rumen Radev, who will present Bulgaria’s position at Katowice, wrote in his Facebook account. The environmental campaign group Europe Beyond Coal has said Bulgarian Energy Holding with its Maritsa East 2 plant is one of Europe’s biggest air polluters.

2018-11-29,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Wind turbine maker Vestas sees U.S. demand peaking in 2020 as government incentives, which have spurred investments in the sector, are phased out. The Danish company is the turbine maker most exposed to the U.S. market, where it competes with General Electric and Siemens Gamesa. Strong interest from utilities looking to replace retiring coal assets and big companies looking to buy renewable power will ensure U.S. demand does not fall off a cliff, as some analysts have predicted, Vestas’ North American chief said. “There’s no such thing as a cliff,” Chris Brown said at the firm’s capital markets day on Thursday.  “I think that 2020 is going to be the peak of where the demand is and you’re going to see it fall off a little bit as you lose the PTC (production tax credit). And then you’re probably going to see it come back,” he later told Reuters.  The PTC scheme has been critical to enabling wind projects to compete with fossil fuel plants but will start being gradually phased out from 2020. Brown pointed to 22 gigawatt (GW) of unmet demand by 2030 from so-called RE100 companies, which is an alliance of firms including Goldman Sachs, Walmart and Starbucks that aims to get 100 percent of electricity from renewable sources to combat climate change. Another 11 GW of unmet demand comes from utilities across the United States looking to replace coal plants with new wind generation, Brown added.

2018-11-29,"HUSAVIK, Iceland, Nov 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - For half the year, the temperature on Pall Olafsson’s remote farm in Iceland often dips below freezing and the sun barely makes an appearance. Yet the heat and light in his greenhouses allow Olafsson to grow his juicy tomatoes and cucumbers even in the depths of winter - thanks largely to the geothermal energy that gives his tiny North Atlantic nation its title, the Land of Fire and Ice. “When we started using the lights and growing all year round, then it changed a lot,” said Olafsson as workers busily pruned plants behind him. “(Before), you were picking the last tomatoes in November and next you pick in April. Maybe 20 years ago, it was like that.” Olafsson credits the hot springs that bubble up from the earth a short distance away with turning Hveravellir into one of Iceland’s biggest vegetable farms, producing about 500 tonnes of tomatoes, cucumber and paprika a year. Iceland’s volcanic origins have blessed the island of 350,000 inhabitants with abundant geothermal energy - a renewable resource that, unlike solar or wind power, is unaffected by its unpredictable weather. Geothermal energy makes up a quarter of Iceland’s electricity - all of which comes from renewable sources - and has helped boost the year-round availability of fresh food in the past two decades. The naturally hot water is piped in to heat the greenhouses and the hot springs are also a key source power for the artificial lights that help farmers grow their crops even in winter, when the island sees barely three hours of sunlight. Icelandic farmers began artificially lighting their greenhouses about 20 years ago. But the real game-changer was the technology that allows them to control every detail remotely from a smartphone, said Knutur Rafn Armann, who runs the Fridheimer tomato farm with his wife Helena. “We have a steering computer in every greenhouse connected to our weather station, connected to our model PC computer, which is connected to the internet,” he said. “So whenever I go somewhere I always have my iPhone with me and I can water the plants, open windows, and change settings or steer everything through my phone.” The remote island historically imported much of its food. But the double whammy of the 2008 financial crisis and a volcanic eruption that prevented planes from landing in 2010 have encouraged greater self-sufficiency. Now, at least half the tomatoes and cucumbers sold here are locally grown, said Gunnlaugur Karlsson, managing director of Solufelag Gardyrkjumanna (SFG), which packages and markets fruit and vegetables. He believes it is common sense for a remote, disaster-prone island to produce as much of its own food as possible - and besides, local produce sells. This year SFG began working with farmers to take their food into kindergartens, ensuring the children eat produce that is locally grown and pesticide-free. The industry is doing what it can to encourage people to buy local, but many believe the government could do more to help. “The authorities do not care if the food is imported or locally grown, as long as it is not contaminated with harmful chemicals etc,” said Helgi Johannesson, a farming consultant. A spokesman for Iceland’s Ministry of Industries and Innovation said the government was working on a policy to procurement local food for government institutions. However, farmers say the government could achieve more by giving them preferential rates for electricity. Currently just 0.5 percent of Iceland’s total power goes to farmers, who say they have to pay a higher rate than the electricity-hungry aluminium industry. The state-owned power provider Landsvirkjun does not disclose prices and the Icelandic government declined to comment. “I often say to the government, if we decide to use 1 percent of electricity to make healthy, good food for ourselves, that would be great,” said tomato farmer Armann. “But of course (they) would have to lower the prices to the farmers.” (Reporting By Thin Lei Win @thinink, Editing by Claire Cozens.

2018-11-29,"* Plans to pay out at least $100 mln from 2019 * Froze dividends in 2015 * Eyes one-off dividend for 2018 (Adds details from capital markets day) By Shadia Nasralla LONDON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Africa-focused Tullow Oil will return to paying dividends, which it suspended in 2015 due to the oil price crash, and expects to pay out at least $100 million from 2019 with an option for a special dividend for this year, it said. Tullow forecast its net debt would drop to $2.8 billion by the end of the year and slightly raised its full-year free cash flow to $700 million earlier this month, helped by trimming its capital expenditure. Tullow has around 1.39 billion outstanding shares, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, implying a dividend of at least around $0.07 per share. “Having reached our target of being a balanced self-funding exploration and production business and having embedded cost discipline across the group, this is the right time to reinstate a dividend and focus on our plans for growth,” Chief Executive Paul McDade said in a statement on Thursday. The dividend will be paid on a semi-annual basis based on the free cash flow Tullow makes while keeping debt and investment in mind, it said, adding the board will look at other types of returns to shareholders if cash abounds. “With respect to the 2018 financial year, the board will review the potential for a one-off ordinary dividend after the year-end financial close,” Tullow said. Tullow, with a market cap of around 2.5 billion pounds ($3.2 billion), had raised the possibility of returning to paying dividends in April. Tullow plans to spend $570 million next year, at the upper end of its $200-$600 million capital expenditure range. At a capital markets day, McDade told reporters plans for final investment decisions on its East African ventures in Uganda in the first half and Kenya at the end of next year still held. He said the company was driving to complete a farm-down - or the sale of a share in its rights over a discovery - in Uganda to Total by the end of this year, but declined to put a probability on that timeframe. As for the pipeline project in Kenya that would carry oil from onshore fields to the port of Lamu, he said if all commercial and ownership questions were settled by the third quarter of 2019, a final investment decision would still be possible by the end of that year. In addition to its fields in Ghana, where it will reach gross plateau production of 180,000 barrels per day over the coming weeks, the East African ventures are due to boost Tullow’s output by around 50 percent to 150,000 bpd from the early 2020s. Tullow also plans to drill three wells offshore Guyana next year in one of the world’s most-watched basins.

Europe’s leading euro zone index gave up some of its earlier gains but remained 0.4 percent higher, with tech, mining and autos sectors - the worst hit by recent losses - scoring the biggest gains. Wall Street was set for a weaker open with S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures down 0.2 to 0.5 percent after Trump struck an uncompromising tone on trade. Trump said on Thursday there was “a long way to go” on tariffs with China and urged companies to build products in the United States to avoid them. “The messaging from the U.S. over the last four weeks has been characteristically erratic,” said David Page, senior economist at AXA Investment Managers. The market is closely watching a meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G20 summit on Saturday at which the leaders are expected to discuss trade. Investors say a sustained market rally following the summit would hinge on there being substantive concessions from Trump, in particular whether Xi can persuade Trump to postpone a sharp tariff hike on Chinese goods due to take effect Jan. 1. “If Trump were able to get those additional concessions from China at this meeting, and announce certainly no trade deal, but... a commitment to further negotiations to work towards a deal and in the interim not see further escalation, then that’s something markets would latch onto,” Page added. U.S. stocks had enjoyed a strong rally on Wednesday after Powell said U.S. interest rates were “just below” neutral, less than two months after saying rates were probably “a long way” from that point. “Given the volatility you’ve seen recently, it’s probably quite reasonable to expect a little bit of a bounce. That being said, given the headwinds out there I can’t see it being sustained,” said Gary Waite, portfolio manager at Walker Crips in London. Powell’s comments briefly pushed the U.S. 10-year bond yield below the psychologically key 3 percent level earlier on Thursday, its lowest level since mid-September. The yield, which had risen as high as 3.25 percent earlier this month, inched back to 3.02 percent by 1220 GMT. The dollar, which has outperformed bonds and the S&P 500 this year, benefiting from rising interest rates and safe-haven flows triggered by global trade tensions, fell back after Powell spoke. Following an overnight 0.6 percent slide, it was flat around 96.8 against a basket of currencies. European bonds too rallied across the board, with German 10-year yields hitting a three-month low of 0.322 percent, down 3 basis points on the day. Italy’s borrowing costs slipped too, with 10-year yields dipping around 2 bps. A bond auction enjoyed much better buying interest than at last week’s deal targeting retail investors as the government has shown signs it could compromise with the European Union on its budget deficit target. Debt costs at the auction fell to their lowest in two months, with 10-year yields at 3.24 percent, down from 3.36 percent at October’s auction, while five-year yields tumbled 23 bps versus last month. Italy’s yield spread over Germany — effectively the premium investors require to hold Italian risk — tightened to 290 bps . On currency markets, the euro edged 0.2 percent higher at $1.1370 after advancing 0.7 percent the previous day. Sterling lost 0.4 percent to $1.2771 against the dollar after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned a disorderly Brexit could trigger a worse economic downturn for the UK than the financial crisis. In commodities, oil prices reversed course and rose after sources said Russia had accepted the need for cuts in production together with OPEC. Brent crude LCOc1> rose 51 cents to $59.27per barrel. It has slumped 21 percent this month, during which it fell to a 13-month trough of $58.41. Emerging market stocks hit a three-week high, with the index up 0.7 percent as investors bought back into risky assets. An index of emerging currencies surged 1.4 percent to a 10-day high.

2018-11-29,"(Repeats with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The crude oil market is likely to be fixated in coming days on the interactions of U.S. President Donald Trump, his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia’s embattled Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at this weekend’s G20 meeting. Throw in a dash of U.S.-China trade politics at a much anticipated dinner on Saturday between Trump and President Xi Jingping and the G20 gathering in Buenos Aires is potentially going to deliver a smorgasbord of juicy headlines to drive crude prices. While the focus of crude oil market participants is correct, and indeed they have little choice but to focus on the machinations of Trump, Putin and Bin Salman, there is always a risk of placing too much emphasis on the politics of oil. The G20 meeting may do nothing more than to confirm what is already widely known, namely that Trump wants oil prices at least as low as they currently are, and that Putin and Bin Salman want them higher, but not so high as to risk a continual blast of Twitter sprays from the mercurial U.S. leader. It would take a major surprise from the G20 summit to alter the market view that crude is currently oversupplied, and that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, including Russia, are planning on reducing output at their Dec. 6 meeting. In the meantime, there are other developments in the market that may not be as headline-grabbing, such as the dynamics of China, the world’s largest crude importer. China’s crude imports are on track to post a second straight monthly record, with vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Refinitiv pointing to imports totalling 10.29 million barrels per day (bpd). This would be up from the 9.61 million bpd reported by customs in October, which was the highest on record, exceeding the 9.6 million bpd in April. The customs numbers and the ship-tracking data don’t exactly match, given slight differences in when cargoes are counted as having arrived and been cleared. However, even if the November estimate is on the optimistic side, it’s still possible that China’s crude imports will exceed 10 million bpd in a month for the first time ever. It’s also worth noting that the November imports likely don’t reflect the full impact of Brent crude’s recent 32 percent plunge, from a close of $86.28 a barrel on Oct. 3 to $58.76 on Wednesday. Many of the cargoes that have arrived in November would have been arranged, and paid for, when crude oil prices were near their recent peak. This raises the possibility that China will import more crude in coming months, especially if the authorities in Beijing and the state-controlled oil majors decide to use the current weakness in prices to speed up the filling of the strategic reserve. China doesn’t release regular updates on the status of its strategic stockpiles, but most market estimates are that it is only about half way to meeting the target of 90 days of import cover. Imports for storage are an underlying bullish indicator for China’s crude demand, but they aren’t the only factor worth following. The rise of independent refiners since 2015, when they were first granted quotas to import crude, has also been a positive over the longer term, but also leads to shorter-term volatility. The smaller refiners are believed to have been active in the market in recent months, as they attempt to fill their import quotas prior to the end of the year. This may result in a bringing forward of some demand, meaning the independents may buy less in the early months of the new year. There is also uncertainty surrounding Iran, with Refinitiv reporting that its estimate of November arrivals includes four Iranian tankers, holding about 7.8 million barrels, that have been floating off China’s Dalian port since the beginning of this month. There may be some temptation on the part of Chinese refiners to buy Iranian crude while they still can, given the waiver granted by the United States to China and seven other Iranian customers will expire around April next year. What is certain is that China isn’t buying any cargoes from the United States, even though crude isn’t yet subject to any tariffs as part of the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing, unlike coal and liquefied natural gas. No U.S. tankers have been assessed by Refinitiv as having been discharged in China since September, with refiners re-selling cargoes to India and Taiwan. What is clear is that even a brief look at the current dynamics of China’s crude imports shows there is considerably more to the market than merely the focus on the likely news headlines from the G20 circus.

2018-11-29,"WARSAW, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Poland will start investing in a new coal mine next year in the south of the country, Deputy Energy Minister Grzegorz Tobiszowski said on Thursday, a few days before U.N. climate talks start there in one of the country’s most polluted cities. “We’re planning an investment next year in building a new coal mine in Silesia, as this could make sense,” Tobiszowski told a press conference. He declined to give any further details. “Poland needs coal and either this will be our coal or from outside,” Tobiszowski also said, referring to Poland’s increased coal imports, mostly from Russia as domestic production has fallen. The most important U.N. climate conference since the Paris Agreement of 2015 opens on Sunday in Katowice in Silesia to try to work out a rule book for enforcing the pact. Ahead of the talks, the European Union’s climate chief has called for the bloc to take the lead and aim for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. “I don’t see that in 2050 there will be no coal-fuelled power plants in Poland. The life span of power plants will not end in 2050,” Energy Minister Krzysztof Tchorzewski told the same press conference. A draft version of Poland’s long-term energy strategy lays out plans to reduce the share of coal in power production to around 60 percent by 2030 from around 80 percent now. Poland has also laid out goals to replace some coal with offshore wind, solar and also nuclear power by 2040, but none of these have yet had government consent, with the shift to nuclear especially divisive. Poland’s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, which won the 2015 election partly on a promise to support coal production, argues Poland cannot afford a sudden U-turn and needs the transition to greener energy to be gradual. Environmental campaigners are seeking to increase the pressure on Poland for change and this week Greenpeace activists climbed a 180-metre chimney at state-run utility PGE’s coal-fuelled power plant. On Thursday Greenpeace threatened to sue PGE unless it phases out coal by 2030. “After protesting at the plant, we have written to PGE asking the coal utility to do what is needed to avoid a climate catastrophe. If PGE does not respond to these requests, we will take them to court,” Pawel Szypulski from Greenpeace said. PGE declined to comment.

2018-11-29,"LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia is becoming increasingly convinced it needs to reduce oil output in tandem with OPEC but is still bargaining with the producer group’s leader, Saudi Arabia, over the timing and volume of any reduction, two industry sources told Reuters. The Russian Energy Ministry held a meeting with the heads of domestic oil producers on Tuesday, ahead of a gathering in Vienna of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies on Dec. 6-7. “The idea at the meeting was that Russia needs to reduce. The key question is how quickly and by how much,” said one source familiar with the talks between Russian oil firms and the ministry. “Most people agreed that we cannot reduce immediately, it needs to be a gradual process like last time,” said the source, who asked not to be identified as he is forbidden from speaking to the media. The Energy Ministry declined to comment. Russian oil companies Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and Gazprom Neft (SIBN.MM) declined to comment. Lukoil (LKOH.MM), Tatneft (TATN.MM), Surgutneftegas, Gazprom (GAZP.MM) and Novatek (NVTK.MM) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. OPEC and its allies led by Russia have been restraining production under a pact reached in late 2016 to prop up oil prices.  Moscow agreed to curb output by 300,000 barrels per day, or one sixth of the overall cut of 1.8 million bpd, but Russian companies took several months to reach that level of reduction. Now, Riyadh has suggested OPEC and its allies reduce output by 1 million bpd from January 2019 to arrest a price decline as Brent crude LCOc1 fell below $59 a barrel this week from as high as $85 in October due to concerns about a possible glut. If Russia bore the same proportion of such cuts as it did under the existing agreement, its share of the reduction would amount to 166,000 bpd. “It was also said that reducing by one sixth this time is a big ask,” the source said. A second source briefed on the discussions said: “We need to reduce but would not want to reduce by much.” OPEC and its allies will be meeting amid concerns over a slowing global economy and rising oil supplies from the United States, which is not involved in the existing pact. Saudi Arabia is coming under renewed pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has asked the kingdom to refrain from output reductions and help to lower oil prices further. Possibly complicating any decision at next week’s talks is the crisis around the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month. Trump has backed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman despite calls from many U.S. politicians to impose stiff sanctions on Riyadh. Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet Prince Mohammed in Argentina at this weekend’s G20 summit, which Trump is also to attend.  Moscow has so far not committed to any new production cuts. On Wednesday, Putin said Russia was in touch with OPEC but Moscow would be satisfied with an oil price of $60 a barrel. Putin previously said Russia would be content with oil at $70. “We are in contact with OPEC and we are ready to continue our joint efforts if needed,” Putin said. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Wednesday the kingdom would not cut oil output on its own. “We generally have our reservations about the likelihood of a 2016-style cooperation this time around, though the Russian position will undoubtedly be crucial,” JBC Energy think-tank said in a note.

2018-11-29,"MUMBAI, Nov 29 (Reuters) - India’s western state of Maharashtra has put on hold the process to buy land for the country’s biggest oil refinery that state-run oil companies are building with Saudi Aramco, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said, after strong opposition from farmers. The $44 billion refinery was seen as a game changer for both parties - offering India steady fuel supplies and meeting Saudi Arabia’s need to secure regular buyers for its oil. But thousands of farmers are refusing to surrender land, fearing it could damage a region famed for its Alphonso mangoes, vast cashew plantations and fishing hamlets that boast bountiful catches of seafood. “The entire (land acquisition) process has been stayed. We haven’t acquired any land,” Fadnavis told state assembly on Wednesday as opposition parties and a coalition partner Shiv Sena were opposing the refinery. The Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd (RRPL), which is running the project, says the 1.2 million barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery, and an integrated petrochemical site with a capacity of 18 million tonnes per year, will help create direct and indirect employment for up to 150,000 people, with jobs that pay better than agriculture or fishing. RRPL, a joint venture between Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum, has said suggestions the refinery would damage the environment were baseless. Issues related to the land for the refinery will be sorted out by the state government soon given the importance of the project, RRPL Chief Executive officer B. Ashok told Reuters. Land acquisition has always been a contentious issue in rural India, where a majority of the population depends on farming for their livelihood. In 2008, for example, India’s Tata Motors had to shelve plans for a car factory in an eastern state after facing widespread protests from farmers.

2018-11-29,"MUNICH, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Prosecutors are investigating three German Siemens employees based in St. Petersburg over allegations they violated EU embargo rules, the Hamburg public prosecutor’s office said. Siemens exported seven gas turbines to Russia in 2015 and 2016, but they were later installed in Russia-annexed Crimea, which is subject to sanctions from the European Union. The bloc imposed sanctions after Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Kiev in March, 2014, and ratcheted them up as Moscow went on to back rebels fighting against government troops in east Ukraine. Siemens said in its annual report published on Wednesday that it was fully cooperating with the authorities. The turbines were worth 213 million euros and the investigation had been going on since May, a spokesman for the prosecutor said. Siemens said that the turbines were ordered and delivered for a power plant project in Taman in southern Russia. But they were then transferred to Crimea by Siemens’ Russian customer OAO VO TechnoPromExport and installed in new gas-fired power plants in a breach of the sales contract. Siemens sued OAO VO TechnoPromExport in Russia, aiming for a cancellation of the sales contract. But its case was dismissed by four consecutive courts, Siemens said.

2018-11-29,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Global temperatures are on course for a 3-5 degrees Celsius (5.4-9.0 degrees Fahrenheit) rise this century, far overshooting a global target of limiting the increase to 2C (3.6F) or less, the U.N. World Meteorological Organization said on Thursday.  “Greenhouse gas concentrations are once again at record levels and if the current trend continues we may see temperature increases 3-5 degrees C by the end of the century,” Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in the WMO’s annual statement on the state of the climate. “If we exploit all known fossil fuel resources, the temperature rise will be considerably higher.” Scientists say that it is vital to limit the rise in global temperatures to 2 Celsius to avert more extreme weather, rising sea levels and the loss of plant and animal species, although limiting the rise to 1.5C would have a far greater benefit. At the 2015 Paris climate conference, the countries of the world pledged to work to limit the rise to 2C, a step that will require a radical reduction in the use of the fossil fuels that are the primary cause of global warming. On Sunday, the most important U.N. climate conference since Paris opens in Katowice, Poland, in one of the most polluted coal-mining regions in Europe. The talks are intended to produce a “rule book” on how to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement, which the United States, at the behest of President Donald Trump, has announced it will quit. Success, according to the conference’s Polish host, will need a miracle.     Taalas said that the lower end of the range, a 3C rise in temperatures, came from a model assuming that countries acted on their pledges to meet the Paris targets.  “If all the countries were able to meet their pledges, we would be able to reach 3 degrees, which would mean a growing amount of disasters and difficulties with agriculture,” he said.

2018-11-29,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Researchers in Singapore are seeking a patent for a new sound-proof and heat-resistant material made from recycled plastic bottles they say could help reduce plastic waste dumped in oceans and clogging landfills. The National University of Singapore team said it had found a way to convert bottles made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into aerogels that have many potential uses - from insulation and fire safety to cleaning up oil spills. “Plastic waste is one of the hardest wastes to recycle,” Hai Minh Duong, an associate professor at the university’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, told Reuters Television. The team had been looking for novel engineering applications to help reduce the global scourge of plastic waste, he said. Some eight million tonnes of plastic is dumped into oceans every year, killing marine life and entering the human food chain, according to the U.N. Environment Program. Five Asian countries - China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand - accounted for up to 60 percent of plastic waste leaking into oceans, according to a 2015 study. The PET aerogels made from plastic bottle waste are soft, flexible, durable, very light and easy to handle, the team said in a statement this month. One recycled bottle can produce an A4-sized aerogel sheet, the team said, and the material can be customized for various uses by adding surface treatments to enhance its ability to absorb and insulate.  For example, a sheet coated with fire retardant chemicals was able to withstand temperatures of up to 620 degrees Celsius. That is seven times higher than a regular thermal lining in a firefighter’s coat, and only 10 percent of the weight. Versions of the material can also be used for heat and sound insulation in buildings, cleaning oil spills and in masks to absorb carbon monoxide.  The team published its research in the scientific journal Colloids and Surfaces A in August. It filed for a patent in March and is looking for partners to mass produce the aerogel. The cost of making a 1 meter by 1 meter by 1 cm sheet could be less than S$10 ($7.30), Duong said. As countries struggle to cope with growing piles of plastic and other waste, Duong said their invention showed that engineering and technology can offer solutions.  “In the future, my dream is that ... there will be no waste for me to recycle,” he said.

2018-11-29,"LONDON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - LNG Canada, the $30 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) export project, has bagged another client after project shareholder Petronas signed an initial sales deal with trading house Vitol. Royal Dutch Shell decided in October to construct the export terminal. It was the first major investment decision in a new North American LNG export project for two years and was expected to launch a new wave of such projects in the region. Petronas, the Malaysian oil and gas company that bought a 25 percent stake in the project in May, will supply Vitol with 0.8 million tonnes per year (mtpa) of LNG starting from 2024 for 15 years, Vitol said in a statement. “The primary supply to Vitol will come from LNG Canada as well as from (Petronas’) other global LNG supply portfolio,” Vitol said. Vitol joins Asian utilities Tokyo Gas, Toho Gas and Korea Gas Corp (Kogas) as buyers, committing to offtake around 2.4 mtpa collectively. Such long-term agreements normally underpin project finance and are critical before a final investment decision is taken. But because Shell and partners Petronas, PetroChina, Mitsubishi and Kogas are such large players in the LNG market, they can absorb the output into their global portfolios without needing to find significant other buyers. Under previously announced deals, Toho Gas will buy 0.3 mtpa, Tokyo Gas 0.6 mtpa and Kogas 0.7 mtpa from LNG Canada. $1 = 1.3281 Canadian dollars

2018-11-29,"(Clarifies name of World Bank Group in lede) By Michael Taylor KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Cities in emerging markets could attract $29 trillion in climate-related investments like green buildings and electric vehicles over the next decade, the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation (IFC) said on Thursday. Researchers looked at climate action plans of cities with more than 500,000 people, focusing on six sectors: green buildings, public transport, electric vehicles, waste management, water treatment and renewable energy. “Getting the cities right is absolutely essential for climate,” said Alzbeta Klein, the IFC’s director for climate business. “They play a role in how climate looks and how it defines for the next generation ahead of us.” More than half the global population lives in urban areas, according to the IFC. Cities consume over two-thirds of the world’s energy, and account for more than 70 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions. Green investments, targets and policies in cities will be crucial if countries are to meet the emissions reduction targets endorsed by governments for the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb climate change. Green building codes, which include reducing energy consumption, will account for $24.7 trillion of climate investment opportunities in cities by 2030, the report said. Low-carbon transportation such as energy-efficient public transport could attract $1 trillion during the same period, while electric vehicles could see $1.6 trillion in investments. Clean energy could bring $842 billion of investments, while water may attract $1 trillion, and waste management $200 billion. Over half of the total estimated investment potential will be needed in East Asian and Pacific cities as they grow and spend on real estate, infrastructure and transport, said Aditi Maheshwari, lead author of the study. “Cities are driving economic growth in East Asia and the Pacific - they account for over 80 percent of GDP in most countries,” Maheshwari told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “The scale of this economic opportunity is drawing people into the cities and we anticipate an additional 1.2 billion people will live in Asian cities in the next 35 years.” The rate of change in China is likely to account for a significant portion of climate-related investments in the region, she added. For cities to attract investment and create a pipeline of bankable projects, they need the ability to borrow money and develop innovative methods like green bonds and public-private partnerships, Klein said. On Wednesday, C40 Cities, a network of cities pushing climate action, announced that nine cities would be given specialist support to develop sustainable infrastructure projects over the next two years. The cities - which include Bogota in Colombia, South Africa’s Tshwane, and Quezon City in the Philippines - will get help from national and international experts to prepare financially sound business proposals for projects. Projects will include bike-sharing, cycle lanes, waste water treatment and rooftop solar energy, the C40 statement said. Reporting by Michael Taylor @MickSTaylor; Editing by Jared

2018-11-29,"JERUSALEM, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Israeli energy conglomerate Delek Group said on Thursday that third-quarter profit more than doubled, boosted by record sales at its main natural gas field. Delek reported quarterly profit of 323 million shekels ($87 million), up from 151 million shekels a year earlier, which excluded the sale of part of its stake in the Tamar offshore gas field. Last year subsidiary Delek Drilling recorded a one-time profit of $567 million from the sale of a 9.25 percent stake in the Tamar field, Israel’s main natural gas source. Including that one-off gain, Delek’s profit in the third quarter of 2017 was 1.02 billion shekels. Delek said it hopes to sell its remaining 22 percent stake in Tamar next year. It is looking to spin off the shares on a foreign market. Revenue rose to 2.3 billion shekels from 1.8 billion, lifted by higher sales at Tamar and improved prices and volumes at its North Sea unit Ithaca Energy.

European stocks rallied, with the leading euro zone index up 0.8 percent, and tech, mining and autos sectors - the worst hit by recent losses - scoring the biggest gains. Yields on German bonds fell, tracking a decline in U.S. Treasury yields, after Powell said on Wednesday that U.S. interest rates were “just below” neutral, less than two months after saying rates were probably “a long way” from that point. “Given the volatility you’ve seen recently, it’s probably quite reasonable to expect a little bit of a bounce. That being said, given the headwinds out there I can’t see it being sustained,” said Gary Waite, portfolio manager at Walker Crips in London. Powell’s comments triggered a rally in U.S. stocks and pushed the U.S. Treasury 10-year bond yield as low as 3.01 percent on Thursday, its lowest level since mid-September and down from this month’s high of 3.25 percent. The yield on two-year Treasury bonds fell for the third straight session. The dollar, which has outperformed bonds and the S&P 500 this year thanks to rising yields and trade tariffs, fell back on Powell’s comments. The dollar index inched down to 96.731 following an overnight loss of 0.6 percent. In Europe, Italy’s government bond yields also dipped ahead of an auction of five- and 10-year bonds. Demand is expected to much stronger than at last week’s BTP Italia deal targeting retail investors. Italy’s five-year bond yield dipped 4 bps to 2.36 percent and the closely-watched spread over Germany was at 294 bps. Italian debt has rallied this week as the government said it was ready to compromise with the European Union on its budget deficit target. European stock gains came on the heels of a broadly positive session in Asia. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6 percent, although the Shanghai Composite Index slipped 1 percent. Gains were tempered by investor jitters before trade talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday, during the G20 summit in Argentina. Analysts saw a chance of a knee-jerk rally in markets on any signs of progress, though substantive concessions would be needed for a more sustained recovery. “Trade détente at the G20 is unlikely but it’s not priced. Even with EM recouping relative performance since early October, a pretty severe trade downturn still looks priced in,” said Citi analysts. Key to markets will be whether Xi can persuade Trump to postpone a sharp tariff hike on Chinese goods due to take effect Jan. 1. In currencies, the euro edged 0.04 percent higher at $1.1370 after advancing 0.7 percent the previous day. Sterling lost 0.4 percent to $1.2771 against the dollar after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned a disorderly Brexit could trigger a worse economic downturn for the UK than the financial crisis. In commodities, oil prices regained some ground from losses in the previous session, but an increase in U.S. crude inventories and uncertainty in the run to an OPEC meeting next week kept markets under pressure. U.S. crude futures were up 0.3 percent at $50.41 per barrel after sliding 2.5 percent the previous day. Brent crude LCOc1> rose 0.2 percent to $59.69 per barrel. It has slumped 21 percent this month, during which it fell to a 13-month trough of $58.41.

European stocks rallied, with the leading euro zone index up 0.8 percent, and tech, mining and autos sectors - the worst hit by recent losses - scoring the biggest gains. Yields on German bonds fell, tracking a decline in U.S. Treasury yields, after Powell said on Wednesday that U.S. interest rates were “just below” neutral, less than two months after saying rates were probably “a long way” from that point. “Given the volatility you’ve seen recently, it’s probably quite reasonable to expect a little bit of a bounce. That being said, given the headwinds out there I can’t see it being sustained,” said Gary Waite, portfolio manager at Walker Crips in London. Powell’s comments triggered a rally in U.S. stocks and pushed the U.S. Treasury 10-year bond yield as low as 3.01 percent on Thursday, its lowest level since mid-September and down from this month’s high of 3.25 percent. The yield on two-year Treasury bonds fell for the third straight session. The dollar, which has outperformed bonds and the S&P 500 this year thanks to rising yields and trade tariffs, fell back on Powell’s comments. The dollar index inched down to 96.731 following an overnight loss of 0.6 percent. In Europe, Italy’s government bond yields also dipped ahead of an auction of five- and 10-year bonds. Demand is expected to much stronger than at last week’s BTP Italia deal targeting retail investors. Italy’s five-year bond yield dipped 4 bps to 2.36 percent and the closely-watched spread over Germany was at 294 bps. Italian debt has rallied this week as the government said it was ready to compromise with the European Union on its budget deficit target. European stock gains came on the heels of a broadly positive session in Asia. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6 percent, although the Shanghai Composite Index slipped 1 percent. Gains were tempered by investor jitters before trade talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday, during the G20 summit in Argentina. Analysts saw a chance of a knee-jerk rally in markets on any signs of progress, though substantive concessions would be needed for a more sustained recovery. “Trade détente at the G20 is unlikely but it’s not priced. Even with EM recouping relative performance since early October, a pretty severe trade downturn still looks priced in,” said Citi analysts. Key to markets will be whether Xi can persuade Trump to postpone a sharp tariff hike on Chinese goods due to take effect Jan. 1. In currencies, the euro edged 0.04 percent higher at $1.1370 after advancing 0.7 percent the previous day. Sterling lost 0.4 percent to $1.2771 against the dollar after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned a disorderly Brexit could trigger a worse economic downturn for the UK than the financial crisis. In commodities, oil prices regained some ground from losses in the previous session, but an increase in U.S. crude inventories and uncertainty in the run to an OPEC meeting next week kept markets under pressure. U.S. crude futures were up 0.3 percent at $50.41 per barrel after sliding 2.5 percent the previous day. Brent crude LCOc1> rose 0.2 percent to $59.69 per barrel. It has slumped 21 percent this month, during which it fell to a 13-month trough of $58.41.

2018-11-29,"* Adani says it will fully fund Australia mine itself * Does not give timeframe for starting production * Project has faced raft of delays * Green groups have strongly opposed the development (Adds Adani, green group comment) By Sonali Paul Nov 29 (Reuters) - India’s Adani Enterprises will fully fund its coal mine and rail project in Australia itself, the company said on Thursday, taking a big step closer to building the long-touted project that has faced fierce resistance from green groups. Adani Mining Chief Executive Lucas Dow announced the funding milestone for the Carmichael mine in a speech in Queensland, a state that has been counting on the project to create jobs. He did not comment on the actual cost. Last year, the company said it was looking to borrow under A$2 billion ($1.46 billion) to get the A$4 billion project off the ground, targeting its first exports in March 2020. Having missed many deadlines over the past few years, Adani also declined to give a timeframe on Thursday for beginning construction or the first production from Carmichael. Adani shrank the project plans early last year to make it more affordable after running into problems lining up financing, as banks backed away from funding new coal mines under pressure from investors worried about climate change. It now plans to start by producing around 10 million tonnes a year for the company’s own use, eventually ramping up to 27.5 million tonnes for the first stage of the project. A mine of that size with a rail spur would typically take around two years to build. Initial output is just a quarter of Adani’s original plan to produce as much as 40 million tonnes a year spending A$16.5 billion to build a mine along with rail and port infrastructure. The reduced plan only requires a 200-km (124-mile) rail spur connecting to Aurizon Holdings’ rail line, rather than a whole new 388-km competing line, and no port expansion, which helped drive down the cost. “The sharpening of the mine plan has kept operating costs to a mininum,” Dow said in his speech. “The project stacks up both environmentally and financially,” he said. The mine has battled a string of lawsuits from environmental groups, who argue it will contribute to global warming and damage Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. “We will fight this to the end. This is not a done deal,” Australian Marine Conservation Society spokeswoman Imogen Zethoven said in a statement, saying the company still needed some final approvals. Adani said the only approvals the project now needs are standard clearance for mine management plans. $1 = 1.3672 Australian dollars

2018-11-29,"(Repeats story published late on Wednesday with no changes to text) By Abhirup Roy MUMBAI, Nov 28 (Reuters) - India’s Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance (ABSLI) plans to increase its holdings in oil marketing companies as crude prices come under pressure and valuations in the sector turn attractive ahead of general elections next year. “I think over the last five years we’ve seen a huge re-rating of these stocks and a very sharp correction as we approach the elections,” Deven Sangoi, chief investment officer for equities at ABSLI, the life insurance arm of Aditya Birla Capital, told Reuters. The S&P BSE Oil and Gas index has lost more than 20 percent of its value since it touched a record high of 16,727.41 in November last year. Oil prices have slumped by more than 30 percent since early October, pressured by concerns supply will exceed demand in 2019 as economic growth slows. With U.S. inventories rising, it slipped to below $60 a barrel on Wednesday. Sangoi said he expected oil prices to remain between $50-$60 a barrel. Oil might even drop to $40 a barrel, if there is a demand shock due to a global growth slump, he added, potentially giving a boost to oil marketing companies’ margins. “If this oil call goes right, then I think oil marketing companies are a value,” said Sangoi, who manages about 280 billion rupees ($4 billion) in equities out of ABSLI’s 390 billion rupees of assets under management. Indian Oil Corp, Hindustan Petroleum Corp and Bharat Petroleum Corp are among the top oil marketing companies in India. Sangoi’s bet also hinges on the outcome of national elections due by May. He said the current government had let oil marketing companies maintain their margins during a period of rising crude prices by passing the cost to consumers. Opinion polls show Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains the front runner to win another five-year term, but his Bharatiya Janata Party has suffered reverses in recent local elections that have energised the opposition. Markets are looking now for cues from five key state elections in the next few weeks. “If the Modi government comes back, then this sector will just go through the roof,” Sangoi said. He is also betting on power generating companies next year, as a pick up in economic growth boosts demand for energy. “I’m a very firm believer that there is going to be very high growth in energy consumption, if we continue to grow at 6-7 percent,” Sangoi said. An increase in tariffs by the regulator and better capacity utilisation at power plants should also help these firms, he said. Elsewhere, Sangoi said he expected private sector banks, especially those with corporate clients, to benefit next year as non-banking financial firms suffer from an ongoing credit crisis and bad loans, which have plagued lenders, continue to dwindle. $1 = 70.5800 Indian rupees

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open higher, with Britain’s FTSE rising 0.5 percent, Germany’s DAX adding 0.6 percent and France’s CAC gaining 0.65 percent.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6 percent. Australian stocks gained 0.6 percent and Japan’s Nikkei climbed 0.4 percent. But the Shanghai Composite Index bucked the trend and slipped 1 percent. Gains in Asia were tempered by investor jitters ahead of high-stakes trade talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Saturday on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina. Economists at ANZ pointed out that policy hawks in the Trump administration who want Washington to take a tough stance against Beijing appear to be in the ascendancy. “They will want some concessions from China, not least of all on what they perceive is theft of intellectual property and forced technology transfer,” wrote the ANZ economists. “Thus, it would seem the prospect of the Trump-Xi meeting ending without a sustainable resolution to their differences is relatively high.” Analysts believe any signs of a thaw in U.S.-China tensions could trigger a knee-jerk rally, but say the move would likely be short lived unless there are substantive concessions — most notably if Xi can persuade Trump to postpone a sharp tariff hike on Chinese goods due to take effect Jan. 1. The Dow rallied 2.5 percent and Nasdaq surged nearly 3 percent on Wednesday as Powell’s comments eased fears of a faster pace of rate hikes in 2019. “Equities gained as Powell hinted of implementing fewer rate hikes when the economy is still doing well,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. “The likelihood of slower U.S. monetary tightening caused the dollar to slump against currencies, particularly the euro, which could soon benefit from an ECB rate hike.” The euro was 0.15 percent higher at $1.1384 after advancing 0.7 percent the previous day. The dollar dipped 0.35 percent to 113.26 yen after being knocked down from a two-week high above 114.00 scaled overnight. The Australian dollar, sensitive to shifts in broader risk sentiment, jumped more than 1 percent on Wednesday and last stood at $0.7319 for a gain of 0.15 percent. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies inched down to 96.731 following an overnight loss of 0.6 percent. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 3.013 percent, its lowest since Sept. 18, following Powell’s comments. The two-year Treasury yield was down for the third straight session.

2018-11-29,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - The crude oil market is likely to be fixated in coming days on the interactions of U.S. President Donald Trump, his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia’s embattled Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at this weekend’s G20 meeting. Throw in a dash of U.S.-China trade politics at a much anticipated dinner on Saturday between Trump and President Xi Jingping and the G20 gathering in Buenos Aires is potentially going to deliver a smorgasbord of juicy headlines to drive crude prices. While the focus of crude oil market participants is correct, and indeed they have little choice but to focus on the machinations of Trump, Putin and Bin Salman, there is always a risk of placing too much emphasis on the politics of oil. The G20 meeting may do nothing more than to confirm what is already widely known, namely that Trump wants oil prices at least as low as they currently are, and that Putin and Bin Salman want them higher, but not so high as to risk a continual blast of Twitter sprays from the mercurial U.S. leader. It would take a major surprise from the G20 summit to alter the market view that crude is currently oversupplied, and that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, including Russia, are planning on reducing output at their Dec. 6 meeting. In the meantime, there are other developments in the market that may not be as headline-grabbing, such as the dynamics of China, the world’s largest crude importer. China’s crude imports are on track to post a second straight monthly record, with vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Refinitiv pointing to imports totalling 10.29 million barrels per day (bpd). This would be up from the 9.61 million bpd reported by customs in October, which was the highest on record, exceeding the 9.6 million bpd in April. The customs numbers and the ship-tracking data don’t exactly match, given slight differences in when cargoes are counted as having arrived and been cleared. However, even if the November estimate is on the optimistic side, it’s still possible that China’s crude imports will exceed 10 million bpd in a month for the first time ever. It’s also worth noting that the November imports likely don’t reflect the full impact of Brent crude’s recent 32 percent plunge, from a close of $86.28 a barrel on Oct. 3 to $58.76 on Wednesday. Many of the cargoes that have arrived in November would have been arranged, and paid for, when crude oil prices were near their recent peak. This raises the possibility that China will import more crude in coming months, especially if the authorities in Beijing and the state-controlled oil majors decide to use the current weakness in prices to speed up the filling of the strategic reserve. China doesn’t release regular updates on the status of its strategic stockpiles, but most market estimates are that it is only about half way to meeting the target of 90 days of import cover. Imports for storage are an underlying bullish indicator for China’s crude demand, but they aren’t the only factor worth following. The rise of independent refiners since 2015, when they were first granted quotas to import crude, has also been a positive over the longer term, but also leads to shorter-term volatility. The smaller refiners are believed to have been active in the market in recent months, as they attempt to fill their import quotas prior to the end of the year. This may result in a bringing forward of some demand, meaning the independents may buy less in the early months of the new year. There is also uncertainty surrounding Iran, with Refinitiv reporting that its estimate of November arrivals includes four Iranian tankers, holding about 7.8 million barrels, that have been floating off China’s Dalian port since the beginning of this month. There may be some temptation on the part of Chinese refiners to buy Iranian crude while they still can, given the waiver granted by the United States to China and seven other Iranian customers will expire around April next year. What is certain is that China isn’t buying any cargoes from the United States, even though crude isn’t yet subject to any tariffs as part of the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing, unlike coal and liquefied natural gas. No U.S. tankers have been assessed by Refinitiv as having been discharged in China since September, with refiners re-selling cargoes to India and Taiwan. What is clear is that even a brief look at the current dynamics of China’s crude imports shows there is considerably more to the market than merely the focus on the likely news headlines from the G20 circus.

2018-11-29,"LONDON (Reuters) - When countries gather on Sunday to hammer out how they will enact pledges to cut carbon emissions, a Norwegian-led oil consortium will offer a solution: pump some of your excess carbon dioxide to us and we could store it for you. Environmentalists worry the costly technology, known as carbon capture and storage (CCS), will perpetuate the fossil fuel status quo when rapid and deep cuts energy use are needed to limit global warming. But proponents of CCS will be lobbying hard at the two-week climate conference in Katowice, Poland, for the extensive investment and regulatory change required to employ it at scale, citing U.N. assessments that it could play a role. “The expectation is that Katowice will be important,” said Stephen Bull, a senior vice president at Norwegian state-controlled oil company Equinor (EQNR.OL), which is involved in developing a CCS project called Northern Lights. “CCS is the only way to go,” he said, arguing that countries need the technology to help fulfil the pledges they made around the time of the breakthrough Paris climate change agreement in 2015. A United Nations report warned on Tuesday that nations would have to triple their current efforts to keep global temperature rises within boundaries scientists say are needed to avoid devastating floods, storms and drought. Along with the United States, Norway is one of the countries at the forefront of drive for CCS, building on 20 years of diverting carbon dioxide from its vast gas output and using some to push out hard-to-reach oil from aging fields. Oslo plans what it says will be the first viable project to use CCS to limit industrial emissions by taking carbon dioxide from industrial plants at home and abroad and storing it permanently in empty oil reservoirs under the seabed. The relatively small scale of the project, along with the unsolved problem of who will pay for it, highlight the obstacles to getting CCS technology off the ground. Organizers of the estimated 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) Northern Lights project say it could store around 5 million tonnes per year of emissions from a Norwegian waste-to energy plant, a cement plant as well as emissions from other countries. This is a tiny fraction of the 6 billion tonnes per year that would need to be stored by 2050 according to the International Energy Agency, which coordinates industrialized nations’ energy policies. The project still needs the Norwegian government to take a final investment decision, something which Trude Sundset, CEO of Gasnova, the Norwegian state’s CCS enterprise, said was scheduled for 2020 or 2021. That would depend on how the project developed, she said, adding it was also necessary to bring industry and other countries on board.  “It is not easy to find a good business model in the short, medium term,” she said. “It’s naive to think one country can pay; it has to be a collaboration between industry and government.” A European Union climate strategy published on Wednesday said rapid deployment of renewables meant the potential of CCS to be a major decarbonization option appeared lower than before. But it said CCS would be needed, especially if the bloc wanted to reach a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. “For sure, we have to improve carbon capture and storage and we have to invest,” EU climate chief Miguel Arias Canete told Reuters. Earlier attempts to fund CCS in Europe have largely failed. An EU program in 2012 did not go on to fund a single CCS project and a British support scheme was canceled in 2015. Britain’s government now plans to help develop the country’s first commercial project which will capture carbon dioxide to be used in industrial applications by the mid-2020s. Europe’s Green party prioritizes energy efficiency, recycling, tree-planting and renewable energy, but says there could be a role for CCS in offsetting emissions from processes like steelmaking. “We need to experiment with it. There is an industrial application — think steel,” Bas Eickhout, Dutch Green MEP and climate spokesman for the Greens, told Reuters. “The problem is that the longer we wait, the more it (CCS) becomes a necessary evil.” Graphic: Carbon capture technology - tmsnrt.rs/2RfMgR3 Eighteen large-scale CCS plants are in operation around the world, according to the Global CCS Institute, which says 2,500 CCS facilities, each able to store 1.5 million tonnes a year, would be needed by 2040 to keep global warming within a 2C rise. Countries as far afield as Algeria and Japan are working with CCS but only two of the world’s CCS operations are on power plants. The CCS industry sees potential for many more.  While Europe focuses on renewables and replacing emissions-heavy coal with gas, developing countries say they cannot move so fast and U.S. President Donald Trump, who pulled his country out of the U.N.’s Paris climate change accord, promotes coal. But the U.S. Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) think tank said this month that coal plants are having a difficult time competing with wind and solar resources which have come down rapidly in price even without CCS. “Economics is a serious issue. And to do CCS on a wide scale you need to build a whole new infrastructure: new pipelines, find repositories which would work, inspection equipment and then monitoring,” said IEEFA’S David Schlissel.  IEEFA estimates putting CCS on an average U.S. coal plant would cost nearly $100/megawatt hour (MWh). This compares to average power purchase agreement prices for wind and solar of around $20-$40/MWh or less since 2017. The CCS Institute, which represents companies involved in developing the technology, said on Wednesday a feasibility study on fitting CSS to a second coal-fired power station in Saskatchewan, Canada, had shown it could be done more cheaply. It cited a cost of capture at $45 per ton of CO2, saying the study showed coal could be competitive with natural gas. Major mining companies are also counting on CCS. BHP BLT.L (BHP.AX), the world’s biggest listed miner and biggest producer of coking coal, used in steel-making, has set a goal for its own operations to be net zero by the second half of the century, in line with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. BHP has spun off many emissions-heavy operations into another company, South 32 (S32.AX), but the indirect emissions from the products it sells remain very high because of the use of its iron ore and coking coal to make steel. It has also said it hopes to expand its oil production. “If you’re not serious about CCS, you’re not serious about achieving 2 degrees (Celsius warming), let alone 1.5,” Fiona Wild, vice president, climate change and sustainability at BHP, said, referring to limits the U.N. says are needed to avoid a dramatic increase in heat waves, floods and droughts. BHP has given money toward CCS research in China, but says the technology needs investment and regulatory support from countries around the world, including a global carbon tax rather than locals ones — something which remains a long way off. Poland, which depends heavily on coal, mostly mined in Silesia where the December climate talks will take place, has been an advocate for CCS but now emphasizes the role of its forests, calling for them to count as carbon sinks. Professor Stuart Haszeldine from Edinburgh University’s school of Geosciences, acknowledges the role of trees but says CCS is the only way to reach the U.N. goal of net zero emissions by the middle of the century. “Trees can mop up CO2 – but one tree takes 2 kilograms of CO2 every year. Each one of us would need three Wembley stadium football pitches to soak up our emissions,” he said.

The dollar struggled and U.S. Treasury yields dipped after Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that U.S. policy rates were “just below” neutral, less than two months after saying rates were probably “a long way” from that point. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.8 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index edged up 0.2 percent, Australian stocks gained 0.5 percent and Japan’s Nikkei climbed 0.9 percent. However, gains in Asia were tempered by investor jitters ahead of high-stakes trade talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Saturday on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina. Economists at ANZ pointed out that policy hawks in the Trump administration who want Washington to take a tough stance against Beijing appear to be in the ascendancy. “They will want some concessions from China, not least of all on what they perceive is theft of intellectual property and forced technology transfer,” wrote the ANZ economists. “Thus, it would seem the prospect of the Trump-Xi meeting ending without a sustainable resolution to their differences is relatively high.” Analysts believe any signs of a thaw in U.S.-China tensions could trigger a knee-jerk rally but say the move would likely be short lived unless there are substantive compromise from both sides — most notably if Xi can persuade Trump to postpone a sharp tariff hike on Chinese goods due to take effect Jan. 1. The Dow meanwhile rallied 2.5 percent and Nasdaq surged nearly 3 percent on Wednesday as Powell’s comments eased fears of a faster pace of rate hikes in 2019. “Equities gained as Powell hinted of implementing fewer rate hikes when the economy is still doing well,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. “The likelihood of slower U.S. monetary tightening caused the dollar to slump against currencies, particularly the euro, which could soon benefit from an ECB rate hike.” The euro was a shade higher at $1.1374 after advancing 0.7 percent the previous day. The dollar dipped 0.2 percent to 113.46 yen after being knocked down from a two-week high above 114.00 scaled overnight. The Australian dollar, sensitive to shifts in broader risk sentiment, jumped more than 1 percent on Wednesday and last stood little changed at 0.7302. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was effectively flat at 96.805 following an overnight loss of 0.6 percent. The U.S. two-year Treasury yield extended a modest decline from the previous day following Powell’s comments. The yield was down about 1 basis point at 2.796 percent. Oil prices clawed back some ground from losses in the previous session, but an increase in U.S. crude inventories and uncertainty in the run to an OPEC meeting next week kept markets under pressure. U.S. crude futures were up 0.8 percent at $50.66 per barrel after sliding 2.5 percent the previous day. Brent crude rose 0.6 percent to $59.13. It has slumped 21 percent this month, during which it fell to a 13-month trough of $58.41.

2018-11-29,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada’s Alberta province is in talks to buy rail cars to transport 120,000 barrels per day of crude oil and expects a deal to be concluded within weeks, Premier Rachel Notley said on Wednesday, as the oil-rich province tries to move oil stuck in the region because of a lack of pipeline capacity. Notley, who said the cars were needed to help deal with a glut that has slashed the price of Alberta oil, told a business audience she was disappointed the federal government was not helping fund the purchase. Reuters reported last week that Alberta had proposed a joint purchase of two unit trains worth of capacity and estimated the one-time capital cost at about C$350 million (205.49 million pounds). Federal officials are cool to the idea, saying that by the time the first cars come on line late next year, the supply problems will have eased. Alberta estimates it is producing about 250,000 bpd more than can be shipped using existing pipeline and rail capacity.  “Alberta will buy the rail cars ourselves to move this oil,” Notley said in a speech. “We have already engaged a third party to negotiate and work is well under way. We anticipate conclusion of the deal within weeks.” She later told reporters a deal could be announced before year end. Based on the initial talks, Alberta expects the first 15,000 bpd of capacity to come online in December 2019, ramping up to the full 120,000 bpd by August 2020, with the agreement running for three years. “It’s a lot of trains and a lot of cars,” Notley told Maclean’s magazine in a webcast interview on Wednesday evening, noting it took multiple 60,000-barrel unit trains to move the equivalent of 120,000 bpd. The added transport capacity is expected to improve the Canadian crude discount by about $4 over the three-year term, the provincial government said. Under that time line, the first rail cars would roll out just as an expansion of Enbridge Inc’s (ENB.TO) Line 3 oil export pipeline is set to start operation, although Notley argued the rail capacity would still be needed. “Line 3 only clears the market for three months before we find ourselves back in this situation again,” she told Maclean’s. Notley said the cost of buying the cars would be fully recouped through royalties and the selling of shipping capacity. Her spokeswoman, Cheryl Oates, said the province did not anticipate keeping the unit trains beyond 2021. Notley said there was “no excuse” for Ottawa not helping and castigated the federal government for proposing tougher environmental standards that she said would make it harder than ever to build pipelines. The supply glut “is happening because Canada willfully holds Alberta’s economy and Canada’s economy hostage,” she said, estimating the losses at C$80 million a day. Ottawa denies it is being unhelpful, noting that it bought Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd’s (KML.TO) Trans Mountain pipeline earlier this year. Vanessa Adams, a spokeswoman for federal Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi, said Ottawa was analyzing Alberta’s proposal about splitting the cost of the unit trains. Several Canadian crude producers have curtailed production and asked Alberta to mandate cuts for other producers. Oates said a decision on that would be made within a week.  Oates also said Alberta was not considering a “royalty holiday” to incentivize output cuts, adding a number of tools were being considered, including the way royalties were applied. Last week, federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau said businesses would be allowed to write off additional capital investments, something that he said oil industry executives had pressed for.

U.S. crude inventories for the week to Nov. 23 added 3.6 million barrels to the most in a year at 450 million barrels, exceeding expectations, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. “Crude oil prices remained under pressure after oil supply in the U.S. rose ahead of a key OPEC meeting ...

2018-11-29,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s support for oil and gas exploration in the Arctic is incompatible with its international climate change commitments, a report from a cross-party group of lawmakers said on Thursday. The international Paris Agreement set a goal of ending the fossil fuel era in the second half of this century in an effort to curb rising temperatures which, if left unchecked are forecast to lead to life-threatening heat and rising sea levels. Britain should cease encouraging British business to explore oil and gas opportunities in the Arctic and call on other nations to adopt a similar approach, the report by the Environment Audit Committee said. “The Government should start by acknowledging the incompatibility of its support for oil and gas exploitation with its climate change commitments,” Mary Creagh, chair of the Environment Audit Committee said in a statement published with the group’s report. The report said Arctic multi-year sea ice is at its lowest level since records began and the Arctic Ocean could be ice free in the summer as soon as 2050. The report called on the government to provide greater funding for Arctic research and set targets to protect Arctic biodiversity as well as setting a timeline to reduce the country’s plastic pollution. It also said the government should press the International Maritime Organisation to ban polluting heavy fuel oils as soon as possible and to designate the Arctic as a special sensitive area. Many oil and gas companies such as Equinor and ENI operate in the Arctic, while U.S. president Donald Trump has pushed for further oil and gas licenses to be made available in the region. Britain’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), which represents Britain at the Arctic Council, said in April that despite moves to decarbonise the world is likely to rely on oil and gas for decades to come. “Supplying this demand will require exploration of new potential resources, with the Arctic, with its significant hydrocarbon reserves, potentially playing a major role,” the FCO report said.
