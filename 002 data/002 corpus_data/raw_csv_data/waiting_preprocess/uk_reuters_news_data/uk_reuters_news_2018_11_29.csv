2018-11-29,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lifted its annual blending mandate for advanced biofuels by 15 percent for 2019, while keeping steady the requirement for conventional biofuels like corn-based ethanol, according to an agency document seen by Reuters on Thursday. The mandate includes 4.92 billion gallons for advanced biofuels that can be made from plant and animal waste, an increase from the EPA’s initial proposal in June of 4.88 billion and above the 4.29 billion that had been set for 2018, according to the document.  The requirement for conventional biofuels remains at 15 billion gallons for 2019, on par with 2018 and the same as proposed by the agency in June. The EPA is required to announce formally the biofuel mandate figures, which are closely watched by the rival corn and oil industries, by Friday. Biodiesel blending credits rose 4 cents to trade at 46 cents on the report, before paring gains, two traders said. Under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, first adopted in 2005, oil refiners are required to blend a certain amount of biofuels, as determined by the EPA, into their fuel each year or purchase blending credits from those that do.  The policy has helped farmers by creating a huge market for ethanol and other biofuels, but oil refiners say compliance can cost a fortune.  The new figures confirm the agency has declined requests by the corn industry to reallocate biofuel blending obligations previously waived under the small refinery exemptions program, which has been expanded dramatically under the administration of President Donald Trump. Small refineries can be exempted from the RFS if they prove that complying would cause them financial strain. The powerful corn lobby and top officials in the U.S. Department of Agriculture have complained for months that the expansion of the waiver program since Trump took office threatens demand for ethanol. An EPA official told Reuters earlier this week that the decision not to reallocate waived volumes was due mainly to timing. “The primary reason why we’re not reallocating in this rule is because we have no idea what the volume of SREs (Small Refinery Exemptions) will be for calendar 2019 and we won’t know that late 2019, early 2020,” the official said. The Trump administration has also temporarily put on hold processing of current waiver applications as the EPA and the Department of Energy review the scoring system used to evaluate them, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.  The EPA is still expected to rule on current applications  before the March 31 compliance deadline for the 2018 calendar year. In an interview with Reuters, Bill Wehrum, assistant administrator at the EPA’s Air and Radiation Department, said most applications have not yet been received.  “For calendar year 2018, I think we are only now starting to get applications, and the bulk of them we are not going to see until probably early next year,” he said, but declined to comment on any expected change in the number of waivers granted.  “I am not going to predict what we may or may not do,” he said. “Each waiver decision is based on an individual application filed by an affected entity.” Biofuels industry participants repeated calls on the EPA to not grant too many waivers. “Without a check on abusive EPA waivers, we’ll continue to see plants closing their doors or idling production,” Brooke Coleman, executive director at the Advanced Biofuels Business Council, said. Trump has sought to please the corn lobby with a different tweak to U.S. biofuel policy: In October he directed the EPA to draft a rule allowing year-round sales of higher ethanol gasoline blends called E15 - a product restricted during the summer over concerns it contributes to smog. Wehrum said the agency was on track to finalize the rule before June 1, in time for the 2019 driving season. “We will get it done by then,” he said. “I think there’s a virtual certainty that we’re going to get challenged in court. I think we gave a good legal argument.”  Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk; Additional reporting by Jarrett Renshaw in New York, Editing by David Gregorio, Richard Valdmanis and Leslie Adler",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-biofuels/exclusive-epa-lifts-advanced-biofuel-mandate-for-2019-document-idUKL2N1Y421M,29 Nov 2018,"The U.S. Environmental

2018-11-29,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil reversed course and rose as much as 2 percent on Thursday, after industry sources said Russia had accepted the need to cut production, together with OPEC ahead of its meeting next week. Prices in November were down nearly 22 percent so far, set for the biggest monthly fall since the depths of the financial crisis in 2008.  A steady rise in crude supply from the United States, now the world’s top producer, has pressured prices along with Saudi Arabia’s insistence that it will not cut output on its own to stabilize the market. Brent crude slid early to another 2018 low below $58 a barrel.  Prices rebounded after sources said Russia would consider joining an effort to cut output along with Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.  The Russian Energy Ministry held a meeting with the heads of domestic oil producers on Tuesday, before a gathering in Vienna of OPEC and its allies on Dec. 6-7. “The idea at the meeting was that Russia needs to reduce. The key question is how quickly and by how much,” said one source familiar with the talks between Russian oil firms and the ministry. The market now expects that a cut of 1 million barrels per day would be possible from OPEC and its allies, said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York.  Brent crude futures rose 75 cents, or 1.3 percent, to settle at $59.51 a barrel, after touching an intraday high of $60.37 a barrel. U.S. crude futures rose $1.16, or 2.3 percent, to $51.45 a barrel, having hit a high of $52.20.  Oil retreated from session highs after the U.S. Federal Reserve released minutes of the latest policy meeting showing interest rate hikes are expected soon. The dollar index edged higher against a basket of currencies, pressuring prices of dollar-denominated oil.  Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose country is the world’s second biggest oil producer, said on Wednesday he was in touch with OPEC and ready to continue cooperation on supply if needed, but was satisfied with an oil price of $60. U.S. crude inventories hit their highest in a year, and are now only 80 million barrels below March 2017’s record 535 million barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration. [EIA/S]  U.S. stockpiles were expected to build again in the latest week, traders said, citing data from energy information service Genscape. Crude stockpiles at the Cushing, Oklahoma hub rose 771,924 barrels since Nov. 23, traders said on Thursday, citing a weekly Genscape report.  U.S. oil reserves in 2017 exceeded a 47-year-old record when they increased 6.4 billion barrels, or 19.5 percent, to 39.2 billion barrels, the government said. Investors are looking ahead to the meeting of leaders of the Group of 20 nations (G20), the world’s biggest economies, on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1, with the U.S.-China trade war in focus. “We have seen huge increases in supply and the demand picture is in question. However, we might see some movement on global trade issues at the G20 meeting which starts on Friday,” said Michael McCarthy, chief strategist at CMC Markets and Stockbroking. Anticipation of the meeting may also be driving prices higher, said Kilduff of Again Capital, adding that traders are wary of being short ahead of the meeting.

World stocks were higher, but it was a mid-day recovery for U.S. stocks, which had sunk amid jitters over U.S.-China trade talks. Powell said on Wednesday that U.S. interest rates were “just below” neutral, less than two months after saying rates were probably “a long way” from that point. Many investors read the remarks as signalling the Fed’s three-year tightening cycle was drawing to a close. His comments briefly pushed the U.S. 10-year bond yield below 3 percent, its lowest since mid-September. The yield, which had risen as high as 3.25 percent this month, inched back to 3.0334 percent. Almost all Fed officials at the meeting agreed another interest rate increase was “likely to be warranted fairly soon,” but also opened debate on when to pause further hikes and how to relay those plans to the public. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 98.22 points, or 0.39 percent, to 25,464.65, the S&P 500 gained 8.26 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,752.05 and the Nasdaq Composite added 23.33 points, or 0.32 percent, to 7,314.93. Other stock markets were broadly higher. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.59 percent. In Europe, stock gains were driven by the tech, mining and autos sectors, which were worst hit by recent losses. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.20 percent. Investors will watch a meeting at which U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are expected to discuss trade at the G20 summit on Saturday. Trump said there was “a long way to go” on tariffs with China and urged companies to build products in the United States to avoid them. “The messaging from the U.S. over the last four weeks has been characteristically erratic,” said David Page, senior economist at AXA Investment Managers. The dollar, which has outperformed bonds and the benchmark S&P 500 stock index this year amid rising interest rates and safe-haven flows triggered by global trade tensions, was modestly higher. The dollar index, tracking it against a basket of six major currencies, rose 0.01 percent, with the euro up 0.17 percent to $1.1385. Sterling was last trading at $1.278, down 0.34 percent on the day, after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned a disorderly Brexit could trigger a worse economic downturn for Britain than the financial crisis. In commodities, oil prices rose after sources said Russia had accepted the need for cuts in production together with OPEC. U.S. crude oil futures settled at $51.45 per barrel, up $1.16 or 2.31 percent. Brent crude settled at $59.51, up 1.28 percent. Italy’s borrowing costs slipped, with 10-year yields dipping around 2 bps. A bond auction enjoyed much better buying interest than at last week’s deal targeting retail investors as the government has shown signs it could compromise with the European Union on its budget deficit target.

2018-11-29,"SAN JOSÉ TIPCEH, Mexico (Reuters) - The Yucatan peninsula, dividing the Gulf of Mexico from the Caribbean, is among Mexico’s top destinations for renewable energy firms thanks to its strong winds and sunny climate. Home to bustling tourist resorts such as Cancun, the area is also a big energy consumer.  But some of its Mayan indigenous communities are resisting rapid development of $1.1 billion of renewable energy projects and preparing to fight a plan to build a railway across the peninsula. President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Saturday, wants to fast track the construction of the tourist and freight line. “In the communities, there is concern that their opinion will not be taken into account once again with this project,” said Carlos Escoffié, lawyer for the Collective of Mayan Communities in the Chenes region. In San Jose Tipceh, a town of 500 people surrounded by jungles, indigenous leaders delayed by 18 months a multi-million dollar renewable energy project by U.S.-based solar company SunPower Corp, which planned to begin operations in August.  “We are practically selling our families for a little bit of money,” said resident Damián Mugarte, threatening to take the battle to Mexico’s highest court.  Indigenous resistance capitalizes on a law passed in the wake of the 1994 Zapatista uprising in southern Mexico that compels the government to consult with indigenous people for projects on their land. But the rules are ambiguous for investors and communities alike.     Some experts warn that unless the new government puts in place clear guidelines all sides agree on, the issue has the potential to stall railways, ports, mines and other infrastructure projects.      “If not fixed, the problem can become the main obstacle for economic growth,” said Hector Garza of international law firm Ritch Mueller who has advised the current government in developing the legal framework for this process.  Rodolfo Salazar, who heads the consultation department for the current government at the Ministry of Energy, said rules put in place had helped resolve some conflicts but acknowledged they were not adequate to win the trust of indigenous populations.         Left-leaning Lopez Obrador has pledged to amend the constitution to further reflect the indigenous rights, a move that will force the government and companies to pay more heed to their concerns. That may make it harder to build the Mayan Train, a 1,525-km (948-mile) railway planned in the states of Yucatan, Quintana Roo, Campeche, Tabasco and Chiapas, connecting the rainforest and the beach.  It could also spell difficulties for another railway to connect the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, which Lopez Obrador hopes could boost the economy of the poor southern state of Oaxaca.In an effort to win popular backing for the project, Lopez Obrador last week held a national referendum on the Mayan Train and nine other policy initiatives - including an oil refinery in the Gulf of Mexico - as part of his pledge to allow greater popular say in government decision-making during his six-year term.  But the referendums have stirred controversy because of low participation rates and opaque monitoring of results. Only around 950,000 people voted in the Nov. 24-25 consultation, representing just 1.1 percent of eligible voters.     His first consultation last month called for canceling the construction of a partially built $13 billion airport for Mexico City - sending the peso currency  and the stock market  sharply lower as investors fretted over how he would manage the economy.  Although Lopez Obrador vowed to respect the opinion of towns and villages affected by the Mayan Train, he has also pledged to launch a tender to find a private sector partner for the project soon after he takes office. In Yucatan, activists say that none of the 163 communities through which the train will pass have been provided with information about the project.  The fear is that “they will find people close to the government to simulate popular support, something which has happened repeatedly on the peninsula,” said Escoffié, of the Collective of Mayan Communities. Rights groups, including Amnesty International, have highlighted the need for consultations on projects that will drive through some pristine natural habitats and indigenous lands. Lopez Obrador has said that the train project, which he expects to take four years to complete and to cost between $6 billion and $8 billion, will provide a boost to the economy of the five southern states, which remain less developed than the more industrialized north. The train will provide easier access to key tourist sites, like the Mayan coastal ruins at Tulum and the famed complex at Chichen Itza. Lopez Obrador has said much of the project would be paid for with revenues from tourism taxes in coming years.    Indigenous communities already oppose almost a dozen projects across Mexico’s southern states awarded in 2016 as part of President Enrique Pena Nieto’s bid to generate more than a third of Mexico’s electricity from renewable energy by 2024.     Under existing law, projects are put to a vote which the majority must support for projects to go ahead.     But regulations are vague, and communities and international organizations including the United Nations argue that in many cases indigenous peoples have not been consulted properly.        The process has caused frustrations for investors. On the Oaxacan coast, an indigenous Zapotec community won a court order to suspend the construction of a wind farm by French state company EDF since April.         EDF said the delays jeopardize its investments in Mexico.     “How much can we stand?” said Víctor Tamayo, EDF’s regional director in Mexico. “Much of the difficulty we are experiencing is because there are no rules and the federal government is responsible.” In San José Tipceh, SunPower’s investment finally won approval in a consultation. The launch of the massive solar park has been postponed until September 2020.   Many in the impoverished town - where most inhabitants work in agriculture, growing corn, lemons and tangerines - say the park will bring much-needed jobs.     “We are barely surviving here,” complained Anastacio Ake, a 62-year-old evangelical pastor, saying he would welcome the money and the solar panels the company has promised to install in homes.

2018-11-29,"WINNIPEG/TORONTO, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Depressed Canadian oil prices are forcing energy companies to use their shares as a currency to fund acquisitions, but investors have been hard to win over to the strategy. Unusually large price discounts for Canadian crude, due to clogged pipelines, and faltering global prices have made growth hard to realize. Some producers have reduced output and lower cash flow has left consolidation using stock as the main option. Shares of Encana Corp, Baytex Energy Corp and International Petroleum Corp, for examples, each plummeted by double-digits on the days they announced deals to buy rivals with shares. The TSX energy index performed better on those days, although it has been in steep decline since early October. “We’ve been getting shocked with bad news all year, and investors don’t necessarily believe that consolidation is a big enough catalyst to offset all the macro headwinds,” said Kevin Brent, vice-president of investment for BlueSky Equities, which owns shares in Seven Generations Energy and Crescent Point Energy Corp. Canadian oil producers face a dwindling amount of capital willing to invest in the sector, leaving many with a stark choice, said Eric Nuttal, senior portfolio manager at Ninepoint Partners, which owns shares in MEG Energy, Baytex and Athabasca Oil. “Do you increase in scale and get your market cap above $1 billion to get on the radar screen? Or do you just throw in the towel?” Many are scaling up. The result, Nuttall said, will likely be more deals into early 2019, and a shrinking number of small-cap Canadian oil producers in the long term. The Canadian oil patch has made 29 deals so far in the second half, worth $9.5 billion, the busiest half-year period for deals since the first half of 2017, according to Cormark Securities data. Further deals may have to rely on shares and private equity, said Andy Mah, CEO of Advantage Oil & Gas. “When you get into a period of such volatility, I think any kind of M&A is very difficult because revenues are certainly challenged.” Shareholders are mainly interested in companies that pay dividends or buy back shares, said Cormark analyst Amir Arif. “It’s almost like you can’t win if you’re a Canadian energy company,” said Janan Paskaran, a partner at Torys LLP who provides M&A advice to energy companies. “It’s hard to invest within Canada, and it’s tough to get investor support when you expand outside.” “People are saying, ‘let’s not spend any capital.’” On Tuesday, Trinidad Drilling shareholders rejected a friendly stock deal to sell to Precision Drilling Corp , choosing instead the certainty of a cash offer from Ensign Energy Services. Swiss-based IPC’s shares have traded more in line with the industry since the steep sell-off last month when it announced its purchase of BlackPearl Resources, and investors generally support the deal, said CEO Mike Nicholson. “We’re now well positioned for the recovery over the next two to three years,” Nicholson said in an interview from Geneva. “Should we start to see (Canadian) pipelines and crude-by-rail improve, I think there’s a huge amount of upside now in our share price.” (Reporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg, Manitoba and John Tilak in Toronto Editing by Phil Berlowitz)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/canada-crude-ma/canadian-oil-producers-trade-shares-for-growth-but-investors-hard-to-impress-idUKL2N1Y41T8,29 Nov 2018,"Depressed Canadian oil

Vedanta Chairman Anil Agarwal and Cairn Chief Executive Sudhir Mathur met with executives from 70 services companies this week in Houston to encourage the firms to organise consortia to compete for contracts, Agarwal said in a briefing. “They’re very encouraged by the 41 blocks and they’re looking to work together,” Agarwal said.  The company won 41 of the 55 blocks auctioned under India’s first licensing round for small discovered fields earlier this year. It expects the blocks will eventually produce 500,000 barrels per day of oil equivalent, said Mathur.      Some of the acquired blocks are near existing Cairn fields and could be producing as early as 12 months to 18 months after contracts are awarded, he said.   Vedanta hopes to receive offers from companies including Schlumberger NV (SLB.N), Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and General Electric’s Baker Hughes (BHGE.N) by the first quarter of next year, he said.  Vedanta hopes to speed up development of the blocks by getting the oilfield firms to organise consortia that would deliver integrated services. It is hoping to get “at least four” groups to submit bids and will offer incentives to the consortia that can beat production targets, he said.  “If we have one unified team, the decision-making can be faster,” said Mathur. “It will be better to work in a joint fashion.”  Reporting by Gary McWilliams; Editing by Dan Grebler and Marguerita Choy",https://uk.reuters.com/article/vedanta-resource-oil-services/update-1-vedanta-seeks-u-s-oil-services-consortium-for-new-india-blocks-idUKL2N1Y41HO,29 Nov 2018,"India's Vedanta Resources

On the Oaxacan coast, an indigenous Zapotec community won a court order to suspend the construction of a wind farm by French state company EDF since April. EDF said the delays jeopardize its investments in Mexico. “How much can we stand?” said Víctor Tamayo, EDF’s regional director in Mexico. “Much of the difficulty we are experiencing is because there are no rules and the federal government is responsible.” In San José Tipceh, SunPower’s investment finally won approval in a consultation. The launch of the massive solar park has been postponed until September 2020. “Every day that passes, there are costs associated,” said Adrien Mallet, director of business development at SunPower in Mexico. However, he said the company was not frustrated by the delay and was focused on strengthening its links with the local community. Many in the impoverished town - where most inhabitants work in agriculture, growing corn, lemons and tangerines - say the park will bring much-needed jobs. “We are barely surviving here,” complained Anastacio Ake, a 62-year-old evangelical pastor, saying he would welcome the money and the solar panels the company has promised to install in homes.

2018-11-29,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street seesawed on Thursday, dragged down late in the day by technology and financial stocks, while the dollar and the U.S. yield curve flattened in the wake of U.S. Federal Reserve news. The Fed released minutes of its latest policy meeting, with almost all of its officials agreeing that another interest rate increase was “likely to be warranted fairly soon,” but also opening debate on when to pause further hikes and how to relay those plans to the public. U.S. stocks had opened lower amid jitters over U.S.-China trade talks. They recovered into positive territory after the Fed minutes but turned negative again late in the day. [.N] The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 27.59 points, or 0.11 percent, to 25,338.84, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 5.99 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,737.8 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 18.51 points, or 0.25 percent, to 7,273.08. Other stock markets were broadly higher. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.29 percent. In Europe, stock gains were driven by the tech, mining and autos sectors, which were worst hit by recent losses. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  rose 0.20 percent.  On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell had said U.S. interest rates were “just below” neutral, less than two months after saying rates were probably “a long way” from that point. Many investors read the remarks as signalling the Fed’s three-year tightening cycle was drawing to a close.  His comments briefly pushed the U.S. 10-year bond yield US10YT=RR below 3 percent, its lowest since mid-September.  The yield, which had risen as high as 3.25 percent this month, inched back to 3.0316 percent. Investors will watch a meeting at which U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are expected to discuss trade at the G20 summit on Saturday. Trump said there was “a long way to go” on tariffs with China and urged companies to build products in the United States to avoid them. “The messaging from the U.S. over the last four weeks has been characteristically erratic,” said David Page, senior economist at AXA Investment Managers.

2018-11-29,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lifted its annual blending mandate for advanced biofuels by 15 percent for 2019, while keeping steady the requirement for conventional biofuels like corn-based ethanol, according to an agency document seen by Reuters on Thursday. The mandate includes 4.92 billion gallons for advanced biofuels that can be made from plant and animal waste, an increase from the EPA’s initial proposal in June of 4.88 billion and above the 4.29 billion that had been set for 2018, according to the document.  The requirement for conventional biofuels remains at 15 billion gallons for 2019, on par with 2018 and the same as proposed by the agency in June. The EPA is required to announce formally the biofuel mandate figures, which are closely watched by the rival corn and oil industries, by Friday. Biodiesel blending credits rose 4 cents to trade at 46 cents on the report, before paring gains, two traders said. Under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, first adopted in 2005, oil refiners are required to blend a certain amount of biofuels, as determined by the EPA, into their fuel each year or purchase blending credits from those that do.  The policy has helped farmers by creating a huge market for ethanol and other biofuels, but oil refiners say compliance can cost a fortune.  The new figures confirm the agency has declined requests by the corn industry to reallocate biofuel blending obligations previously waived under the small refinery exemptions program, which has been expanded dramatically under the administration of President Donald Trump. Small refineries can be exempted from the RFS if they prove that complying would cause them financial strain. The powerful corn lobby and top officials in the U.S. Department of Agriculture have complained for months that the expansion of the waiver program since Trump took office threatens demand for ethanol. An EPA official told Reuters earlier this week that the decision not to reallocate waived volumes was due mainly to timing. “The primary reason why we’re not reallocating in this rule is because we have no idea what the volume of SREs (Small Refinery Exemptions) will be for calendar 2019 and we won’t know that late 2019, early 2020,” the official said. The Trump administration has also temporarily put on hold processing of current waiver applications as the EPA and the Department of Energy review the scoring system used to evaluate them, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.  The EPA is still expected to rule on current applications  before the March 31 compliance deadline for the 2018 calendar year. In an interview with Reuters, Bill Wehrum, assistant administrator at the EPA’s Air and Radiation Department, said most applications have not yet been received.  “For calendar year 2018, I think we are only now starting to get applications, and the bulk of them we are not going to see until probably early next year,” he said, but declined to comment on any expected change in the number of waivers granted.  “I am not going to predict what we may or may not do,” he said. “Each waiver decision is based on an individual application filed by an affected entity.” Biofuels industry participants repeated calls on the EPA to not grant too many waivers. “Without a check on abusive EPA waivers, we’ll continue to see plants closing their doors or idling production,” Brooke Coleman, executive director at the Advanced Biofuels Business Council, said. Trump has sought to please the corn lobby with a different tweak to U.S. biofuel policy: In October he directed the EPA to draft a rule allowing year-round sales of higher ethanol gasoline blends called E15 - a product restricted during the summer over concerns it contributes to smog. Wehrum said the agency was on track to finalize the rule before June 1, in time for the 2019 driving season. “We will get it done by then,” he said. “I think there’s a virtual certainty that we’re going to get challenged in court. I think we gave a good legal argument.”  Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk; Additional reporting by Jarrett Renshaw in New York, Editing by David Gregorio, Richard Valdmanis and Leslie Adler",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-biofuels/exclusive-epa-lifts-advanced-biofuel-mandate-for-2019-document-idUKL2N1Y421M,29 Nov 2018,"The U.S. Environmental

2018-11-29,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil reversed course and rose as much as 2 percent on Thursday, after industry sources said Russia had accepted the need to cut production, together with OPEC ahead of its meeting next week. Prices in November were down nearly 22 percent so far, set for the biggest monthly fall since the depths of the financial crisis in 2008.  A steady rise in crude supply from the United States, now the world’s top producer, has pressured prices along with Saudi Arabia’s insistence that it will not cut output on its own to stabilize the market. Brent crude slid early to another 2018 low below $58 a barrel.  Prices rebounded after sources said Russia would consider joining an effort to cut output along with Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.  The Russian Energy Ministry held a meeting with the heads of domestic oil producers on Tuesday, before a gathering in Vienna of OPEC and its allies on Dec. 6-7. “The idea at the meeting was that Russia needs to reduce. The key question is how quickly and by how much,” said one source familiar with the talks between Russian oil firms and the ministry. The market now expects that a cut of 1 million barrels per day would be possible from OPEC and its allies, said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York.  Brent crude futures rose 75 cents, or 1.3 percent, to settle at $59.51 a barrel, after touching an intraday high of $60.37 a barrel. U.S. crude futures rose $1.16, or 2.3 percent, to $51.45 a barrel, having hit a high of $52.20.  Oil retreated from session highs after the U.S. Federal Reserve released minutes of the latest policy meeting showing interest rate hikes are expected soon. The dollar index edged higher against a basket of currencies, pressuring prices of dollar-denominated oil.  Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose country is the world’s second biggest oil producer, said on Wednesday he was in touch with OPEC and ready to continue cooperation on supply if needed, but was satisfied with an oil price of $60. U.S. crude inventories hit their highest in a year, and are now only 80 million barrels below March 2017’s record 535 million barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration. [EIA/S]  U.S. stockpiles were expected to build again in the latest week, traders said, citing data from energy information service Genscape. Crude stockpiles at the Cushing, Oklahoma hub rose 771,924 barrels since Nov. 23, traders said on Thursday, citing a weekly Genscape report.  U.S. oil reserves in 2017 exceeded a 47-year-old record when they increased 6.4 billion barrels, or 19.5 percent, to 39.2 billion barrels, the government said. Investors are looking ahead to the meeting of leaders of the Group of 20 nations (G20), the world’s biggest economies, on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1, with the U.S.-China trade war in focus. “We have seen huge increases in supply and the demand picture is in question. However, we might see some movement on global trade issues at the G20 meeting which starts on Friday,” said Michael McCarthy, chief strategist at CMC Markets and Stockbroking. Anticipation of the meeting may also be driving prices higher, said Kilduff of Again Capital, adding that traders are wary of being short ahead of the meeting.

2018-11-29,"SAN JOSÉ TIPCEH, Mexico (Reuters) - The Yucatan peninsula, dividing the Gulf of Mexico from the Caribbean, is among Mexico’s top destinations for renewable energy firms thanks to its strong winds and sunny climate. Home to bustling tourist resorts such as Cancun, the area is also a big energy consumer.  But some of its Mayan indigenous communities are resisting rapid development of $1.1 billion of renewable energy projects and preparing to fight a plan to build a railway across the peninsula. President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Saturday, wants to fast track the construction of the tourist and freight line. “In the communities, there is concern that their opinion will not be taken into account once again with this project,” said Carlos Escoffié, lawyer for the Collective of Mayan Communities in the Chenes region. In San Jose Tipceh, a town of 500 people surrounded by jungles, indigenous leaders delayed by 18 months a multi-million dollar renewable energy project by U.S.-based solar company SunPower Corp, which planned to begin operations in August.  “We are practically selling our families for a little bit of money,” said resident Damián Mugarte, threatening to take the battle to Mexico’s highest court.  Indigenous resistance capitalizes on a law passed in the wake of the 1994 Zapatista uprising in southern Mexico that compels the government to consult with indigenous people for projects on their land. But the rules are ambiguous for investors and communities alike.     Some experts warn that unless the new government puts in place clear guidelines all sides agree on, the issue has the potential to stall railways, ports, mines and other infrastructure projects.      “If not fixed, the problem can become the main obstacle for economic growth,” said Hector Garza of international law firm Ritch Mueller who has advised the current government in developing the legal framework for this process.  Rodolfo Salazar, who heads the consultation department for the current government at the Ministry of Energy, said rules put in place had helped resolve some conflicts but acknowledged they were not adequate to win the trust of indigenous populations.         Left-leaning Lopez Obrador has pledged to amend the constitution to further reflect the indigenous rights, a move that will force the government and companies to pay more heed to their concerns. That may make it harder to build the Mayan Train, a 1,525-km (948-mile) railway planned in the states of Yucatan, Quintana Roo, Campeche, Tabasco and Chiapas, connecting the rainforest and the beach.  It could also spell difficulties for another railway to connect the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, which Lopez Obrador hopes could boost the economy of the poor southern state of Oaxaca.In an effort to win popular backing for the project, Lopez Obrador last week held a national referendum on the Mayan Train and nine other policy initiatives - including an oil refinery in the Gulf of Mexico - as part of his pledge to allow greater popular say in government decision-making during his six-year term.  But the referendums have stirred controversy because of low participation rates and opaque monitoring of results. Only around 950,000 people voted in the Nov. 24-25 consultation, representing just 1.1 percent of eligible voters.     His first consultation last month called for canceling the construction of a partially built $13 billion airport for Mexico City - sending the peso currency  and the stock market  sharply lower as investors fretted over how he would manage the economy.  Although Lopez Obrador vowed to respect the opinion of towns and villages affected by the Mayan Train, he has also pledged to launch a tender to find a private sector partner for the project soon after he takes office. In Yucatan, activists say that none of the 163 communities through which the train will pass have been provided with information about the project.  The fear is that “they will find people close to the government to simulate popular support, something which has happened repeatedly on the peninsula,” said Escoffié, of the Collective of Mayan Communities. Rights groups, including Amnesty International, have highlighted the need for consultations on projects that will drive through some pristine natural habitats and indigenous lands. Lopez Obrador has said that the train project, which he expects to take four years to complete and to cost between $6 billion and $8 billion, will provide a boost to the economy of the five southern states, which remain less developed than the more industrialized north. The train will provide easier access to key tourist sites, like the Mayan coastal ruins at Tulum and the famed complex at Chichen Itza. Lopez Obrador has said much of the project would be paid for with revenues from tourism taxes in coming years.    Indigenous communities already oppose almost a dozen projects across Mexico’s southern states awarded in 2016 as part of President Enrique Pena Nieto’s bid to generate more than a third of Mexico’s electricity from renewable energy by 2024.     Under existing law, projects are put to a vote which the majority must support for projects to go ahead.     But regulations are vague, and communities and international organizations including the United Nations argue that in many cases indigenous peoples have not been consulted properly.        The process has caused frustrations for investors.

2018-11-29,"WINNIPEG/TORONTO, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Depressed Canadian oil prices are forcing energy companies to use their shares as a currency to fund acquisitions, but investors have been hard to win over to the strategy. Unusually large price discounts for Canadian crude, due to clogged pipelines, and faltering global prices have made growth hard to realize. Some producers have reduced output and lower cash flow has left consolidation using stock as the main option. Shares of Encana Corp, Baytex Energy Corp and International Petroleum Corp, for examples, each plummeted by double-digits on the days they announced deals to buy rivals with shares. The TSX energy index performed better on those days, although it has been in steep decline since early October. “We’ve been getting shocked with bad news all year, and investors don’t necessarily believe that consolidation is a big enough catalyst to offset all the macro headwinds,” said Kevin Brent, vice-president of investment for BlueSky Equities, which owns shares in Seven Generations Energy and Crescent Point Energy Corp. Canadian oil producers face a dwindling amount of capital willing to invest in the sector, leaving many with a stark choice, said Eric Nuttal, senior portfolio manager at Ninepoint Partners, which owns shares in MEG Energy, Baytex and Athabasca Oil. “Do you increase in scale and get your market cap above $1 billion to get on the radar screen? Or do you just throw in the towel?” Many are scaling up. The result, Nuttall said, will likely be more deals into early 2019, and a shrinking number of small-cap Canadian oil producers in the long term. The Canadian oil patch has made 29 deals so far in the second half, worth $9.5 billion, the busiest half-year period for deals since the first half of 2017, according to Cormark Securities data. Further deals may have to rely on shares and private equity, said Andy Mah, CEO of Advantage Oil & Gas. “When you get into a period of such volatility, I think any kind of M&A is very difficult because revenues are certainly challenged.” Shareholders are mainly interested in companies that pay dividends or buy back shares, said Cormark analyst Amir Arif. “It’s almost like you can’t win if you’re a Canadian energy company,” said Janan Paskaran, a partner at Torys LLP who provides M&A advice to energy companies. “It’s hard to invest within Canada, and it’s tough to get investor support when you expand outside.” “People are saying, ‘let’s not spend any capital.’” On Tuesday, Trinidad Drilling shareholders rejected a friendly stock deal to sell to Precision Drilling Corp , choosing instead the certainty of a cash offer from Ensign Energy Services. Swiss-based IPC’s shares have traded more in line with the industry since the steep sell-off last month when it announced its purchase of BlackPearl Resources, and investors generally support the deal, said CEO Mike Nicholson. “We’re now well positioned for the recovery over the next two to three years,” Nicholson said in an interview from Geneva. “Should we start to see (Canadian) pipelines and crude-by-rail improve, I think there’s a huge amount of upside now in our share price.” (Reporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg, Manitoba and John Tilak in Toronto Editing by Phil Berlowitz)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/canada-crude-ma/canadian-oil-producers-trade-shares-for-growth-but-investors-hard-to-impress-idUKL2N1Y41T8,29 Nov 2018,"Depressed Canadian oil

2018-11-29,"JERUSALEM, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Israeli energy conglomerate Delek Group said on Thursday that third-quarter profit more than doubled, boosted by record sales at its main natural gas field. Delek reported quarterly profit of 323 million shekels ($87 million), up from 151 million shekels a year earlier, which excluded the sale of part of its stake in the Tamar offshore gas field. Last year subsidiary Delek Drilling recorded a one-time profit of $567 million from the sale of a 9.25 percent stake in the Tamar field, Israel’s main natural gas source. Including that one-off gain, Delek’s profit in the third quarter of 2017 was 1.02 billion shekels. Delek said it hopes to sell its remaining 22 percent stake in Tamar next year. It is looking to spin off the shares on a foreign market. Revenue rose to 2.3 billion shekels from 1.8 billion, lifted by higher sales at Tamar and improved prices and volumes at its North Sea unit Ithaca Energy. Tamar’s gas sales hit a new quarterly record of 2.8 billion cubic metres (bcm) in the third quarter. The company also has a large share in the nearby Leviathan gas field. It said the Leviathan project is 70 percent complete and remains on schedule for the first gas sales to begin by the end of 2019. Delek and partner Noble Energy agreed in September to buy a stake in a subsea pipeline that will facilitate a $15 billion gas supply deal with Egypt’s Dolphinus Holdings. Delek said it would pay a dividend of 150 million shekels, or 12.5 shekels a share, bringing 2018’s total dividend distribution to 490 million shekels.

Yields on German bonds fell, tracking a decline in U.S. Treasury yields, after Powell said on Wednesday that U.S. interest rates were “just below” neutral, less than two months after saying rates were probably “a long way” from that point. “Given the volatility you’ve seen recently, it’s probably quite reasonable to expect a little bit of a bounce. That being said, given the headwinds out there I can’t see it being sustained,” said Gary Waite, portfolio manager at Walker Crips in London. Powell’s comments triggered a rally in U.S. stocks and pushed the U.S. Treasury 10-year bond yield as low as 3.01 percent on Thursday, its lowest level since mid-September and down from this month’s high of 3.25 percent. The yield on two-year Treasury bonds fell for the third straight session. The dollar, which has outperformed bonds and the S&P 500 this year thanks to rising yields and trade tariffs, fell back on Powell’s comments. The dollar index inched down to 96.731 following an overnight loss of 0.6 percent. In Europe, Italy’s government bond yields also dipped ahead of an auction of five- and 10-year bonds. Demand is expected to much stronger than at last week’s BTP Italia deal targeting retail investors. Italy’s five-year bond yield dipped 4 bps to 2.36 percent and the closely-watched spread over Germany was at 294 bps. Italian debt has rallied this week as the government said it was ready to compromise with the European Union on its budget deficit target. European stock gains came on the heels of a broadly positive session in Asia. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6 percent, although the Shanghai Composite Index slipped 1 percent. Gains were tempered by investor jitters before trade talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday, during the G20 summit in Argentina. Analysts saw a chance of a knee-jerk rally in markets on any signs of progress, though substantive concessions would be needed for a more sustained recovery. “Trade détente at the G20 is unlikely but it’s not priced. Even with EM recouping relative performance since early October, a pretty severe trade downturn still looks priced in,” said Citi analysts. Key to markets will be whether Xi can persuade Trump to postpone a sharp tariff hike on Chinese goods due to take effect Jan. 1. In currencies, the euro edged 0.04 percent higher at $1.1370 after advancing 0.7 percent the previous day. Sterling lost 0.4 percent to $1.2771 against the dollar after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned a disorderly Brexit could trigger a worse economic downturn for the UK than the financial crisis. In commodities, oil prices regained some ground from losses in the previous session, but an increase in U.S. crude inventories and uncertainty in the run to an OPEC meeting next week kept markets under pressure. U.S. crude futures were up 0.3 percent at $50.41 per barrel after sliding 2.5 percent the previous day. Brent crude LCOc1> rose 0.2 percent to $59.69 per barrel. It has slumped 21 percent this month, during which it fell to a 13-month trough of $58.41. Emerging market stocks hit a three-week high, with the index up 0.7 percent as investors bought back into risky assets. Reporting by Helen Reid, additional reporting by Abhinav

2018-11-29,"* Adani says it will fully fund Australia mine itself * Does not give timeframe for starting production * Project has faced raft of delays * Green groups have strongly opposed the development (Adds Adani, green group comment) By Sonali Paul Nov 29 (Reuters) - India’s Adani Enterprises will fully fund its coal mine and rail project in Australia itself, the company said on Thursday, taking a big step closer to building the long-touted project that has faced fierce resistance from green groups. Adani Mining Chief Executive Lucas Dow announced the funding milestone for the Carmichael mine in a speech in Queensland, a state that has been counting on the project to create jobs. He did not comment on the actual cost. Last year, the company said it was looking to borrow under A$2 billion ($1.46 billion) to get the A$4 billion project off the ground, targeting its first exports in March 2020. Having missed many deadlines over the past few years, Adani also declined to give a timeframe on Thursday for beginning construction or the first production from Carmichael. Adani shrank the project plans early last year to make it more affordable after running into problems lining up financing, as banks backed away from funding new coal mines under pressure from investors worried about climate change. It now plans to start by producing around 10 million tonnes a year for the company’s own use, eventually ramping up to 27.5 million tonnes for the first stage of the project. A mine of that size with a rail spur would typically take around two years to build. Initial output is just a quarter of Adani’s original plan to produce as much as 40 million tonnes a year spending A$16.5 billion to build a mine along with rail and port infrastructure. The reduced plan only requires a 200-km (124-mile) rail spur connecting to Aurizon Holdings’ rail line, rather than a whole new 388-km competing line, and no port expansion, which helped drive down the cost. “The sharpening of the mine plan has kept operating costs to a mininum,” Dow said in his speech. “The project stacks up both environmentally and financially,” he said. The mine has battled a string of lawsuits from environmental groups, who argue it will contribute to global warming and damage Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. “We will fight this to the end. This is not a done deal,” Australian Marine Conservation Society spokeswoman Imogen Zethoven said in a statement, saying the company still needed some final approvals. Adani said the only approvals the project now needs are standard clearance for mine management plans. $1 = 1.3672 Australian dollars

2018-11-29,"(Repeats story published late on Wednesday with no changes to text) By Abhirup Roy MUMBAI, Nov 28 (Reuters) - India’s Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance (ABSLI) plans to increase its holdings in oil marketing companies as crude prices come under pressure and valuations in the sector turn attractive ahead of general elections next year. “I think over the last five years we’ve seen a huge re-rating of these stocks and a very sharp correction as we approach the elections,” Deven Sangoi, chief investment officer for equities at ABSLI, the life insurance arm of Aditya Birla Capital, told Reuters. The S&P BSE Oil and Gas index has lost more than 20 percent of its value since it touched a record high of 16,727.41 in November last year. Oil prices have slumped by more than 30 percent since early October, pressured by concerns supply will exceed demand in 2019 as economic growth slows. With U.S. inventories rising, it slipped to below $60 a barrel on Wednesday. Sangoi said he expected oil prices to remain between $50-$60 a barrel. Oil might even drop to $40 a barrel, if there is a demand shock due to a global growth slump, he added, potentially giving a boost to oil marketing companies’ margins. “If this oil call goes right, then I think oil marketing companies are a value,” said Sangoi, who manages about 280 billion rupees ($4 billion) in equities out of ABSLI’s 390 billion rupees of assets under management. Indian Oil Corp, Hindustan Petroleum Corp and Bharat Petroleum Corp are among the top oil marketing companies in India. Sangoi’s bet also hinges on the outcome of national elections due by May. He said the current government had let oil marketing companies maintain their margins during a period of rising crude prices by passing the cost to consumers. Opinion polls show Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains the front runner to win another five-year term, but his Bharatiya Janata Party has suffered reverses in recent local elections that have energised the opposition. Markets are looking now for cues from five key state elections in the next few weeks. “If the Modi government comes back, then this sector will just go through the roof,” Sangoi said. He is also betting on power generating companies next year, as a pick up in economic growth boosts demand for energy. “I’m a very firm believer that there is going to be very high growth in energy consumption, if we continue to grow at 6-7 percent,” Sangoi said. An increase in tariffs by the regulator and better capacity utilisation at power plants should also help these firms, he said. Elsewhere, Sangoi said he expected private sector banks, especially those with corporate clients, to benefit next year as non-banking financial firms suffer from an ongoing credit crisis and bad loans, which have plagued lenders, continue to dwindle. $1 = 70.5800 Indian rupees

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open higher, with Britain’s FTSE rising 0.5 percent, Germany’s DAX adding 0.6 percent and France’s CAC gaining 0.65 percent.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6 percent. Australian stocks gained 0.6 percent and Japan’s Nikkei climbed 0.4 percent. But the Shanghai Composite Index bucked the trend and slipped 1 percent. Gains in Asia were tempered by investor jitters ahead of high-stakes trade talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Saturday on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina. Economists at ANZ pointed out that policy hawks in the Trump administration who want Washington to take a tough stance against Beijing appear to be in the ascendancy. “They will want some concessions from China, not least of all on what they perceive is theft of intellectual property and forced technology transfer,” wrote the ANZ economists. “Thus, it would seem the prospect of the Trump-Xi meeting ending without a sustainable resolution to their differences is relatively high.” Analysts believe any signs of a thaw in U.S.-China tensions could trigger a knee-jerk rally, but say the move would likely be short lived unless there are substantive concessions — most notably if Xi can persuade Trump to postpone a sharp tariff hike on Chinese goods due to take effect Jan. 1. The Dow rallied 2.5 percent and Nasdaq surged nearly 3 percent on Wednesday as Powell’s comments eased fears of a faster pace of rate hikes in 2019. “Equities gained as Powell hinted of implementing fewer rate hikes when the economy is still doing well,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. “The likelihood of slower U.S. monetary tightening caused the dollar to slump against currencies, particularly the euro, which could soon benefit from an ECB rate hike.” The euro was 0.15 percent higher at $1.1384 after advancing 0.7 percent the previous day. The dollar dipped 0.35 percent to 113.26 yen after being knocked down from a two-week high above 114.00 scaled overnight. The Australian dollar, sensitive to shifts in broader risk sentiment, jumped more than 1 percent on Wednesday and last stood at $0.7319 for a gain of 0.15 percent. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies inched down to 96.731 following an overnight loss of 0.6 percent. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 3.013 percent, its lowest since Sept. 18, following Powell’s comments. The two-year Treasury yield was down for the third straight session.

2018-11-29,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - The crude oil market is likely to be fixated in coming days on the interactions of U.S. President Donald Trump, his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia’s embattled Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at this weekend’s G20 meeting. Throw in a dash of U.S.-China trade politics at a much anticipated dinner on Saturday between Trump and President Xi Jingping and the G20 gathering in Buenos Aires is potentially going to deliver a smorgasbord of juicy headlines to drive crude prices. While the focus of crude oil market participants is correct, and indeed they have little choice but to focus on the machinations of Trump, Putin and Bin Salman, there is always a risk of placing too much emphasis on the politics of oil. The G20 meeting may do nothing more than to confirm what is already widely known, namely that Trump wants oil prices at least as low as they currently are, and that Putin and Bin Salman want them higher, but not so high as to risk a continual blast of Twitter sprays from the mercurial U.S. leader. It would take a major surprise from the G20 summit to alter the market view that crude is currently oversupplied, and that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, including Russia, are planning on reducing output at their Dec. 6 meeting. In the meantime, there are other developments in the market that may not be as headline-grabbing, such as the dynamics of China, the world’s largest crude importer. China’s crude imports are on track to post a second straight monthly record, with vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Refinitiv pointing to imports totalling 10.29 million barrels per day (bpd). This would be up from the 9.61 million bpd reported by customs in October, which was the highest on record, exceeding the 9.6 million bpd in April. The customs numbers and the ship-tracking data don’t exactly match, given slight differences in when cargoes are counted as having arrived and been cleared. However, even if the November estimate is on the optimistic side, it’s still possible that China’s crude imports will exceed 10 million bpd in a month for the first time ever. It’s also worth noting that the November imports likely don’t reflect the full impact of Brent crude’s recent 32 percent plunge, from a close of $86.28 a barrel on Oct. 3 to $58.76 on Wednesday. Many of the cargoes that have arrived in November would have been arranged, and paid for, when crude oil prices were near their recent peak. This raises the possibility that China will import more crude in coming months, especially if the authorities in Beijing and the state-controlled oil majors decide to use the current weakness in prices to speed up the filling of the strategic reserve. China doesn’t release regular updates on the status of its strategic stockpiles, but most market estimates are that it is only about half way to meeting the target of 90 days of import cover. Imports for storage are an underlying bullish indicator for China’s crude demand, but they aren’t the only factor worth following. The rise of independent refiners since 2015, when they were first granted quotas to import crude, has also been a positive over the longer term, but also leads to shorter-term volatility. The smaller refiners are believed to have been active in the market in recent months, as they attempt to fill their import quotas prior to the end of the year. This may result in a bringing forward of some demand, meaning the independents may buy less in the early months of the new year. There is also uncertainty surrounding Iran, with Refinitiv reporting that its estimate of November arrivals includes four Iranian tankers, holding about 7.8 million barrels, that have been floating off China’s Dalian port since the beginning of this month. There may be some temptation on the part of Chinese refiners to buy Iranian crude while they still can, given the waiver granted by the United States to China and seven other Iranian customers will expire around April next year. What is certain is that China isn’t buying any cargoes from the United States, even though crude isn’t yet subject to any tariffs as part of the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing, unlike coal and liquefied natural gas. No U.S. tankers have been assessed by Refinitiv as having been discharged in China since September, with refiners re-selling cargoes to India and Taiwan. What is clear is that even a brief look at the current dynamics of China’s crude imports shows there is considerably more to the market than merely the focus on the likely news headlines from the G20 circus.

2018-11-29,"LONDON (Reuters) - When countries gather on Sunday to hammer out how they will enact pledges to cut carbon emissions, a Norwegian-led oil consortium will offer a solution: pump some of your excess carbon dioxide to us and we could store it for you. Environmentalists worry the costly technology, known as carbon capture and storage (CCS), will perpetuate the fossil fuel status quo when rapid and deep cuts energy use are needed to limit global warming. But proponents of CCS will be lobbying hard at the two-week climate conference in Katowice, Poland, for the extensive investment and regulatory change required to employ it at scale, citing U.N. assessments that it could play a role. “The expectation is that Katowice will be important,” said Stephen Bull, a senior vice president at Norwegian state-controlled oil company Equinor (EQNR.OL), which is involved in developing a CCS project called Northern Lights. “CCS is the only way to go,” he said, arguing that countries need the technology to help fulfil the pledges they made around the time of the breakthrough Paris climate change agreement in 2015. A United Nations report warned on Tuesday that nations would have to triple their current efforts to keep global temperature rises within boundaries scientists say are needed to avoid devastating floods, storms and drought. Along with the United States, Norway is one of the countries at the forefront of drive for CCS, building on 20 years of diverting carbon dioxide from its vast gas output and using some to push out hard-to-reach oil from aging fields. Oslo plans what it says will be the first viable project to use CCS to limit industrial emissions by taking carbon dioxide from industrial plants at home and abroad and storing it permanently in empty oil reservoirs under the seabed. The relatively small scale of the project, along with the unsolved problem of who will pay for it, highlight the obstacles to getting CCS technology off the ground. Organizers of the estimated 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) Northern Lights project say it could store around 5 million tonnes per year of emissions from a Norwegian waste-to energy plant, a cement plant as well as emissions from other countries. This is a tiny fraction of the 6 billion tonnes per year that would need to be stored by 2050 according to the International Energy Agency, which coordinates industrialized nations’ energy policies. The project still needs the Norwegian government to take a final investment decision, something which Trude Sundset, CEO of Gasnova, the Norwegian state’s CCS enterprise, said was scheduled for 2020 or 2021. That would depend on how the project developed, she said, adding it was also necessary to bring industry and other countries on board.  “It is not easy to find a good business model in the short, medium term,” she said. “It’s naive to think one country can pay; it has to be a collaboration between industry and government.” A European Union climate strategy published on Wednesday said rapid deployment of renewables meant the potential of CCS to be a major decarbonization option appeared lower than before. But it said CCS would be needed, especially if the bloc wanted to reach a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. “For sure, we have to improve carbon capture and storage and we have to invest,” EU climate chief Miguel Arias Canete told Reuters. Earlier attempts to fund CCS in Europe have largely failed. An EU program in 2012 did not go on to fund a single CCS project and a British support scheme was canceled in 2015. Britain’s government now plans to help develop the country’s first commercial project which will capture carbon dioxide to be used in industrial applications by the mid-2020s. Europe’s Green party prioritizes energy efficiency, recycling, tree-planting and renewable energy, but says there could be a role for CCS in offsetting emissions from processes like steelmaking. “We need to experiment with it. There is an industrial application — think steel,” Bas Eickhout, Dutch Green MEP and climate spokesman for the Greens, told Reuters. “The problem is that the longer we wait, the more it (CCS) becomes a necessary evil.” Graphic: Carbon capture technology - tmsnrt.rs/2RfMgR3 Eighteen large-scale CCS plants are in operation around the world, according to the Global CCS Institute, which says 2,500 CCS facilities, each able to store 1.5 million tonnes a year, would be needed by 2040 to keep global warming within a 2C rise. Countries as far afield as Algeria and Japan are working with CCS but only two of the world’s CCS operations are on power plants. The CCS industry sees potential for many more.  While Europe focuses on renewables and replacing emissions-heavy coal with gas, developing countries say they cannot move so fast and U.S. President Donald Trump, who pulled his country out of the U.N.’s Paris climate change accord, promotes coal. But the U.S. Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) think tank said this month that coal plants are having a difficult time competing with wind and solar resources which have come down rapidly in price even without CCS. “Economics is a serious issue. And to do CCS on a wide scale you need to build a whole new infrastructure: new pipelines, find repositories which would work, inspection equipment and then monitoring,” said IEEFA’S David Schlissel.  IEEFA estimates putting CCS on an average U.S. coal plant would cost nearly $100/megawatt hour (MWh). This compares to average power purchase agreement prices for wind and solar of around $20-$40/MWh or less since 2017. The CCS Institute, which represents companies involved in developing the technology, said on Wednesday a feasibility study on fitting CSS to a second coal-fired power station in Saskatchewan, Canada, had shown it could be done more cheaply. It cited a cost of capture at $45 per ton of CO2, saying the study showed coal could be competitive with natural gas. Major mining companies are also counting on CCS. BHP BLT.L (BHP.AX), the world’s biggest listed miner and biggest producer of coking coal, used in steel-making, has set a goal for its own operations to be net zero by the second half of the century, in line with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. BHP has spun off many emissions-heavy operations into another company, South 32 (S32.AX), but the indirect emissions from the products it sells remain very high because of the use of its iron ore and coking coal to make steel. It has also said it hopes to expand its oil production. “If you’re not serious about CCS, you’re not serious about achieving 2 degrees (Celsius warming), let alone 1.5,” Fiona Wild, vice president, climate change and sustainability at BHP, said, referring to limits the U.N. says are needed to avoid a dramatic increase in heat waves, floods and droughts. BHP has given money toward CCS research in China, but says the technology needs investment and regulatory support from countries around the world, including a global carbon tax rather than locals ones — something which remains a long way off. Poland, which depends heavily on coal, mostly mined in Silesia where the December climate talks will take place, has been an advocate for CCS but now emphasizes the role of its forests, calling for them to count as carbon sinks. Professor Stuart Haszeldine from Edinburgh University’s school of Geosciences, acknowledges the role of trees but says CCS is the only way to reach the U.N. goal of net zero emissions by the middle of the century. “Trees can mop up CO2 – but one tree takes 2 kilograms of CO2 every year. Each one of us would need three Wembley stadium football pitches to soak up our emissions,” he said.

The dollar struggled and U.S. Treasury yields dipped after Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that U.S. policy rates were “just below” neutral, less than two months after saying rates were probably “a long way” from that point. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.8 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index edged up 0.2 percent, Australian stocks gained 0.5 percent and Japan’s Nikkei climbed 0.9 percent. However, gains in Asia were tempered by investor jitters ahead of high-stakes trade talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Saturday on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina. Economists at ANZ pointed out that policy hawks in the Trump administration who want Washington to take a tough stance against Beijing appear to be in the ascendancy. “They will want some concessions from China, not least of all on what they perceive is theft of intellectual property and forced technology transfer,” wrote the ANZ economists. “Thus, it would seem the prospect of the Trump-Xi meeting ending without a sustainable resolution to their differences is relatively high.” Analysts believe any signs of a thaw in U.S.-China tensions could trigger a knee-jerk rally but say the move would likely be short lived unless there are substantive compromise from both sides — most notably if Xi can persuade Trump to postpone a sharp tariff hike on Chinese goods due to take effect Jan. 1. The Dow meanwhile rallied 2.5 percent and Nasdaq surged nearly 3 percent on Wednesday as Powell’s comments eased fears of a faster pace of rate hikes in 2019. “Equities gained as Powell hinted of implementing fewer rate hikes when the economy is still doing well,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. “The likelihood of slower U.S. monetary tightening caused the dollar to slump against currencies, particularly the euro, which could soon benefit from an ECB rate hike.” The euro was a shade higher at $1.1374 after advancing 0.7 percent the previous day. The dollar dipped 0.2 percent to 113.46 yen after being knocked down from a two-week high above 114.00 scaled overnight. The Australian dollar, sensitive to shifts in broader risk sentiment, jumped more than 1 percent on Wednesday and last stood little changed at 0.7302. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was effectively flat at 96.805 following an overnight loss of 0.6 percent. The U.S. two-year Treasury yield extended a modest decline from the previous day following Powell’s comments. The yield was down about 1 basis point at 2.796 percent.

2018-11-29,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada’s Alberta province is in talks to buy rail cars to transport 120,000 barrels per day of crude oil and expects a deal to be concluded within weeks, Premier Rachel Notley said on Wednesday, as the oil-rich province tries to move oil stuck in the region because of a lack of pipeline capacity. Notley, who said the cars were needed to help deal with a glut that has slashed the price of Alberta oil, told a business audience she was disappointed the federal government was not helping fund the purchase. Reuters reported last week that Alberta had proposed a joint purchase of two unit trains worth of capacity and estimated the one-time capital cost at about C$350 million (205.49 million pounds). Federal officials are cool to the idea, saying that by the time the first cars come on line late next year, the supply problems will have eased. Alberta estimates it is producing about 250,000 bpd more than can be shipped using existing pipeline and rail capacity.  “Alberta will buy the rail cars ourselves to move this oil,” Notley said in a speech. “We have already engaged a third party to negotiate and work is well under way. We anticipate conclusion of the deal within weeks.” She later told reporters a deal could be announced before year end. Based on the initial talks, Alberta expects the first 15,000 bpd of capacity to come online in December 2019, ramping up to the full 120,000 bpd by August 2020, with the agreement running for three years. “It’s a lot of trains and a lot of cars,” Notley told Maclean’s magazine in a webcast interview on Wednesday evening, noting it took multiple 60,000-barrel unit trains to move the equivalent of 120,000 bpd. The added transport capacity is expected to improve the Canadian crude discount by about $4 over the three-year term, the provincial government said. Under that time line, the first rail cars would roll out just as an expansion of Enbridge Inc’s (ENB.TO) Line 3 oil export pipeline is set to start operation, although Notley argued the rail capacity would still be needed. “Line 3 only clears the market for three months before we find ourselves back in this situation again,” she told Maclean’s. Notley said the cost of buying the cars would be fully recouped through royalties and the selling of shipping capacity. Her spokeswoman, Cheryl Oates, said the province did not anticipate keeping the unit trains beyond 2021. Notley said there was “no excuse” for Ottawa not helping and castigated the federal government for proposing tougher environmental standards that she said would make it harder than ever to build pipelines. The supply glut “is happening because Canada willfully holds Alberta’s economy and Canada’s economy hostage,” she said, estimating the losses at C$80 million a day. Ottawa denies it is being unhelpful, noting that it bought Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd’s (KML.TO) Trans Mountain pipeline earlier this year. Vanessa Adams, a spokeswoman for federal Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi, said Ottawa was analyzing Alberta’s proposal about splitting the cost of the unit trains. Several Canadian crude producers have curtailed production and asked Alberta to mandate cuts for other producers. Oates said a decision on that would be made within a week.  Oates also said Alberta was not considering a “royalty holiday” to incentivize output cuts, adding a number of tools were being considered, including the way royalties were applied. Last week, federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau said businesses would be allowed to write off additional capital investments, something that he said oil industry executives had pressed for.

U.S. crude inventories for the week to Nov. 23 added 3.6 million barrels to the most in a year at 450 million barrels, exceeding expectations, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. “Crude oil prices remained under pressure after oil supply in the U.S. rose ahead of a key OPEC meeting ...

2018-11-29,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s support for oil and gas exploration in the Arctic is incompatible with its international climate change commitments, a report from a cross-party group of lawmakers said on Thursday. The international Paris Agreement set a goal of ending the fossil fuel era in the second half of this century in an effort to curb rising temperatures which, if left unchecked are forecast to lead to life-threatening heat and rising sea levels. Britain should cease encouraging British business to explore oil and gas opportunities in the Arctic and call on other nations to adopt a similar approach, the report by the Environment Audit Committee said. “The Government should start by acknowledging the incompatibility of its support for oil and gas exploitation with its climate change commitments,” Mary Creagh, chair of the Environment Audit Committee said in a statement published with the group’s report. The report said Arctic multi-year sea ice is at its lowest level since records began and the Arctic Ocean could be ice free in the summer as soon as 2050. The report called on the government to provide greater funding for Arctic research and set targets to protect Arctic biodiversity as well as setting a timeline to reduce the country’s plastic pollution. It also said the government should press the International Maritime Organisation to ban polluting heavy fuel oils as soon as possible and to designate the Arctic as a special sensitive area. Many oil and gas companies such as Equinor and ENI operate in the Arctic, while U.S. president Donald Trump has pushed for further oil and gas licenses to be made available in the region. Britain’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), which represents Britain at the Arctic Council, said in April that despite moves to decarbonise the world is likely to rely on oil and gas for decades to come. “Supplying this demand will require exploration of new potential resources, with the Arctic, with its significant hydrocarbon reserves, potentially playing a major role,” the FCO report said.

2018-11-29,"(Clarifies name of World Bank Group in lede) By Michael Taylor KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Cities in emerging markets could attract $29 trillion in climate-related investments like green buildings and electric vehicles over the next decade, the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation (IFC) said on Thursday. Researchers looked at climate action plans of cities with more than 500,000 people, focusing on six sectors: green buildings, public transport, electric vehicles, waste management, water treatment and renewable energy. “Getting the cities right is absolutely essential for climate,” said Alzbeta Klein, the IFC’s director for climate business. “They play a role in how climate looks and how it defines for the next generation ahead of us.” More than half the global population lives in urban areas, according to the IFC. Cities consume over two-thirds of the world’s energy, and account for more than 70 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions. Green investments, targets and policies in cities will be crucial if countries are to meet the emissions reduction targets endorsed by governments for the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb climate change. Green building codes, which include reducing energy consumption, will account for $24.7 trillion of climate investment opportunities in cities by 2030, the report said. Low-carbon transportation such as energy-efficient public transport could attract $1 trillion during the same period, while electric vehicles could see $1.6 trillion in investments. Clean energy could bring $842 billion of investments, while water may attract $1 trillion, and waste management $200 billion. Over half of the total estimated investment potential will be needed in East Asian and Pacific cities as they grow and spend on real estate, infrastructure and transport, said Aditi Maheshwari, lead author of the study. “Cities are driving economic growth in East Asia and the Pacific - they account for over 80 percent of GDP in most countries,” Maheshwari told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “The scale of this economic opportunity is drawing people into the cities and we anticipate an additional 1.2 billion people will live in Asian cities in the next 35 years.” The rate of change in China is likely to account for a significant portion of climate-related investments in the region, she added. For cities to attract investment and create a pipeline of bankable projects, they need the ability to borrow money and develop innovative methods like green bonds and public-private partnerships, Klein said. On Wednesday, C40 Cities, a network of cities pushing climate action, announced that nine cities would be given specialist support to develop sustainable infrastructure projects over the next two years. The cities - which include Bogota in Colombia, South Africa’s Tshwane, and Quezon City in the Philippines - will get help from national and international experts to prepare financially sound business proposals for projects. Projects will include bike-sharing, cycle lanes, waste water treatment and rooftop solar energy, the C40 statement said. Reporting by Michael Taylor @MickSTaylor; Editing by Jared

2018-11-29,"JERUSALEM, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Israeli energy conglomerate Delek Group said on Thursday that third-quarter profit more than doubled, boosted by record sales at its main natural gas field. Delek reported quarterly profit of 323 million shekels ($87 million), up from 151 million shekels a year earlier, which excluded the sale of part of its stake in the Tamar offshore gas field. Last year subsidiary Delek Drilling recorded a one-time profit of $567 million from the sale of a 9.25 percent stake in the Tamar field, Israel’s main natural gas source. Including that one-off gain, Delek’s profit in the third quarter of 2017 was 1.02 billion shekels. Delek said it hopes to sell its remaining 22 percent stake in Tamar next year. It is looking to spin off the shares on a foreign market. Revenue rose to 2.3 billion shekels from 1.8 billion, lifted by higher sales at Tamar and improved prices and volumes at its North Sea unit Ithaca Energy. Tamar’s gas sales hit a new quarterly record of 2.8 billion cubic metres (bcm) in the third quarter. The company also has a large share in the nearby Leviathan gas field. It said the Leviathan project is 70 percent complete and remains on schedule for the first gas sales to begin by the end of 2019. Delek and partner Noble Energy agreed in September to buy a stake in a subsea pipeline that will facilitate a $15 billion gas supply deal with Egypt’s Dolphinus Holdings.

European stocks rallied, with the leading euro zone index up 0.8 percent, and tech, mining and autos sectors - the worst hit by recent losses - scoring the biggest gains. Yields on German bonds fell, tracking a decline in U.S. Treasury yields, after Powell said on Wednesday that U.S. interest rates were “just below” neutral, less than two months after saying rates were probably “a long way” from that point. “Given the volatility you’ve seen recently, it’s probably quite reasonable to expect a little bit of a bounce. That being said, given the headwinds out there I can’t see it being sustained,” said Gary Waite, portfolio manager at Walker Crips in London. Powell’s comments triggered a rally in U.S. stocks and pushed the U.S. Treasury 10-year bond yield as low as 3.01 percent on Thursday, its lowest level since mid-September and down from this month’s high of 3.25 percent. The yield on two-year Treasury bonds fell for the third straight session. The dollar, which has outperformed bonds and the S&P 500 this year thanks to rising yields and trade tariffs, fell back on Powell’s comments. The dollar index inched down to 96.731 following an overnight loss of 0.6 percent. In Europe, Italy’s government bond yields also dipped ahead of an auction of five- and 10-year bonds. Demand is expected to much stronger than at last week’s BTP Italia deal targeting retail investors. Italy’s five-year bond yield dipped 4 bps to 2.36 percent and the closely-watched spread over Germany was at 294 bps. Italian debt has rallied this week as the government said it was ready to compromise with the European Union on its budget deficit target. European stock gains came on the heels of a broadly positive session in Asia. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6 percent, although the Shanghai Composite Index slipped 1 percent. Gains were tempered by investor jitters before trade talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday, during the G20 summit in Argentina. Analysts saw a chance of a knee-jerk rally in markets on any signs of progress, though substantive concessions would be needed for a more sustained recovery. “Trade détente at the G20 is unlikely but it’s not priced. Even with EM recouping relative performance since early October, a pretty severe trade downturn still looks priced in,” said Citi analysts. Key to markets will be whether Xi can persuade Trump to postpone a sharp tariff hike on Chinese goods due to take effect Jan. 1. In currencies, the euro edged 0.04 percent higher at $1.1370 after advancing 0.7 percent the previous day. Sterling lost 0.4 percent to $1.2771 against the dollar after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned a disorderly Brexit could trigger a worse economic downturn for the UK than the financial crisis. In commodities, oil prices regained some ground from losses in the previous session, but an increase in U.S. crude inventories and uncertainty in the run to an OPEC meeting next week kept markets under pressure. U.S. crude futures were up 0.3 percent at $50.41 per barrel after sliding 2.5 percent the previous day. Brent crude LCOc1> rose 0.2 percent to $59.69 per barrel.

2018-11-29,"* Adani says it will fully fund Australia mine itself * Does not give timeframe for starting production * Project has faced raft of delays * Green groups have strongly opposed the development (Adds Adani, green group comment) By Sonali Paul Nov 29 (Reuters) - India’s Adani Enterprises will fully fund its coal mine and rail project in Australia itself, the company said on Thursday, taking a big step closer to building the long-touted project that has faced fierce resistance from green groups. Adani Mining Chief Executive Lucas Dow announced the funding milestone for the Carmichael mine in a speech in Queensland, a state that has been counting on the project to create jobs. He did not comment on the actual cost. Last year, the company said it was looking to borrow under A$2 billion ($1.46 billion) to get the A$4 billion project off the ground, targeting its first exports in March 2020. Having missed many deadlines over the past few years, Adani also declined to give a timeframe on Thursday for beginning construction or the first production from Carmichael. Adani shrank the project plans early last year to make it more affordable after running into problems lining up financing, as banks backed away from funding new coal mines under pressure from investors worried about climate change. It now plans to start by producing around 10 million tonnes a year for the company’s own use, eventually ramping up to 27.5 million tonnes for the first stage of the project. A mine of that size with a rail spur would typically take around two years to build. Initial output is just a quarter of Adani’s original plan to produce as much as 40 million tonnes a year spending A$16.5 billion to build a mine along with rail and port infrastructure. The reduced plan only requires a 200-km (124-mile) rail spur connecting to Aurizon Holdings’ rail line, rather than a whole new 388-km competing line, and no port expansion, which helped drive down the cost. “The sharpening of the mine plan has kept operating costs to a mininum,” Dow said in his speech. “The project stacks up both environmentally and financially,” he said. The mine has battled a string of lawsuits from environmental groups, who argue it will contribute to global warming and damage Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. “We will fight this to the end. This is not a done deal,” Australian Marine Conservation Society spokeswoman Imogen Zethoven said in a statement, saying the company still needed some final approvals. Adani said the only approvals the project now needs are standard clearance for mine management plans. $1 = 1.3672 Australian dollars

2018-11-29,"(Repeats story published late on Wednesday with no changes to text) By Abhirup Roy MUMBAI, Nov 28 (Reuters) - India’s Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance (ABSLI) plans to increase its holdings in oil marketing companies as crude prices come under pressure and valuations in the sector turn attractive ahead of general elections next year. “I think over the last five years we’ve seen a huge re-rating of these stocks and a very sharp correction as we approach the elections,” Deven Sangoi, chief investment officer for equities at ABSLI, the life insurance arm of Aditya Birla Capital, told Reuters. The S&P BSE Oil and Gas index has lost more than 20 percent of its value since it touched a record high of 16,727.41 in November last year. Oil prices have slumped by more than 30 percent since early October, pressured by concerns supply will exceed demand in 2019 as economic growth slows. With U.S. inventories rising, it slipped to below $60 a barrel on Wednesday. Sangoi said he expected oil prices to remain between $50-$60 a barrel. Oil might even drop to $40 a barrel, if there is a demand shock due to a global growth slump, he added, potentially giving a boost to oil marketing companies’ margins. “If this oil call goes right, then I think oil marketing companies are a value,” said Sangoi, who manages about 280 billion rupees ($4 billion) in equities out of ABSLI’s 390 billion rupees of assets under management. Indian Oil Corp, Hindustan Petroleum Corp and Bharat Petroleum Corp are among the top oil marketing companies in India. Sangoi’s bet also hinges on the outcome of national elections due by May. He said the current government had let oil marketing companies maintain their margins during a period of rising crude prices by passing the cost to consumers. Opinion polls show Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains the front runner to win another five-year term, but his Bharatiya Janata Party has suffered reverses in recent local elections that have energised the opposition. Markets are looking now for cues from five key state elections in the next few weeks. “If the Modi government comes back, then this sector will just go through the roof,” Sangoi said. He is also betting on power generating companies next year, as a pick up in economic growth boosts demand for energy. “I’m a very firm believer that there is going to be very high growth in energy consumption, if we continue to grow at 6-7 percent,” Sangoi said. An increase in tariffs by the regulator and better capacity utilisation at power plants should also help these firms, he said. Elsewhere, Sangoi said he expected private sector banks, especially those with corporate clients, to benefit next year as non-banking financial firms suffer from an ongoing credit crisis and bad loans, which have plagued lenders, continue to dwindle. $1 = 70.5800 Indian rupees
