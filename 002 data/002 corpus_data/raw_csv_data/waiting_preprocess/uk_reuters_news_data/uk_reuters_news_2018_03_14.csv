2018-03-14,"DAKAR, March 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A large-scale United Nations programme to halt deforestation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, home to the world’s second-largest rainforest, is harming local communities and failing to protect forests, land rights researchers said on Wednesday. The U.S.-based group Rights and Resources Initiative (RRI) called on the World Bank to withhold funding from 20 current or pending projects in the province of Mai-Ndombe, which has been a test case for a U.N.-backed conservation scheme known as REDD+. In an area rife with land conflict, an RRI report said the forest protection projects in this western province threatened the rights and incomes of rural women and indigenous groups, including about 73,000 pygmies. “REDD+ was created to both halt deforestation and benefit local communities - yet the current projects in Mai-Ndombe fail to address both objectives,” said Marine Gauthier, the report’s author. A spokesman for the U.N.’s REDD+ programme did not respond to requests for comment. The World Bank was not immediately available for comment. One of the focal cases involves U.S. company Wildlife Works Carbon (WWC), which denied the accusations. The company obtained a large land concession in order to protect a forest from loggers, and uses a share of the money earned from selling carbon credits to benefit people living there, said president Mike Korchinsky. “Millions of dollars of benefits have gone to the communities,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. He said WWC had built schools, invested in medical clinics, and provided years of agricultural support. But Gauthier said local communities, which signed agreements with the company, were not properly consulted, and claimed the project had hindered their farming and other activities. “These communities actually bear the burden of reducing deforestation,” she said. RRI said women and minorities had been worst affected by the REDD+ projects that were up and running, because they often lack formal land rights and are not consulted about decisions. REDD+, or reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation, was one of the solutions to climate change laid out in the 2015 Paris accord. It offers monetary incentives to scale back deforestation. Congo could become the first country to sign a REDD+ deal with the World Bank this year, setting an example for more than 50 developing countries that plan to follow suit, said RRI. However, it warned that deal could exacerbate conflict and set a dangerous global precedent if changes were not made. RRI said it had shared the results and that discussions with donors were underway. (Reporting by Nellie Peyton, Editing by Robert Carmichael and Astrid Zweynert.

2018-03-14,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Eastern China’s Jiangsu province will step up its war on pollution and focus on “high-quality development” following a spike in smog early this year, the China Daily reported, citing the provincial governor. The province of Jiangsu is a major part of the Yangtze river delta manufacturing hub. Concentrations of breathable smog particles known as PM2.5 soared 20 percent in the region in January this year. Jiangsu’s major heavy industrial center Xuzhou was also ranked China’s smoggiest city in December 2017, after a winter campaign to cut emissions in northern China led to a significant drop in PM2.5 concentrations in traditional smog zones. Governor Wu Zhenglong promised “stricter strategies with higher standards” to control emissions, China Daily said. Despite the January spike, average PM2.5 concentrations in the province still fell from 73 micrograms to 49 micrograms last year, the report added.    Late last month, an environment ministry official urged regions in the Yangtze delta and elsewhere to take responsibility for their air quality problems. The Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), said in a report this week that China was winning its war on pollution after cutting average PM2.5 concentrations by 32 percent in just four years. “The available evidence from our monitoring data indicate that pollution has decreased nearly across the board,” said Michael Greenstone, director of EPIC. “We estimate that just 4 percent of the 900 million residents covered by the monitor network saw pollution rise in their prefecture between 2013 and 2017,” he added.

2018-03-14,"(Repeats item with no changes to text) * Coal plants shut March-June to reduce air pollution * Closure of nuclear plants for maintenance adding to shortfall * Increased LNG imports helping meet shortfall in power capacity By Roslan Khasawneh and Jane Chung SINGAPORE/SEOUL, March 14 (Reuters) - South Korea’s move to shut coal-fired generators to control air pollution at the same time as nuclear reactors are going into scheduled maintenance is resulting in surging fuel oil imports, as utilities burn the dirty feedstock to meet power demand. South Korea’s trade ministry said in February it would suspend five coal-fired power plants, with a combined capacity of 2.32 gigawatts (GW), from March to June, part of a broad campaign to reduce pollution. That plan may backfire, at least in the short-term. A cold winter has raised power and heating demand, forcing utilities to burn more fuel oil in order to meet demand. A by-product of the crude oil refining process, fuel oil’s biggest use ahead of power generation is as a shipping fuel. “In the near-term, fuel oil imports will increase to make up for the shortfall in coal-fired generation capacity,” said Pat Markey, managing director of consultancy Sierra Vista Resources. Fuel oil imports by power producers into Asia’s fourth largest economy have jumped to 200,000 tonnes in March so far, up from 92,000 tonnes in February, tender data compiled by Reuters showed. First-quarter fuel oil imports are expected at 417,000 tonnes, up 28 percent from a year ago and already more than 60 percent of the 660,000 tonnes taken for all of last year. Burning fuel oil for power results in lower carbon dioxide emissions than coal-fired plants, but releases more toxic particles into the air. “Pollutants generated during combustion of fuel oils are nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, greenhouse gases, volatile compounds (like unburned hydrocarbons) and toxic trace metals,” according to the U.S. Commission for Environmental Cooperation. An official from a South Korean state-owned utility, said the increased fuel oil demand was partly a result of the government’s decision to halt coal-fired plants temporarily due to pollution and reduced nuclear power because of planned maintenance. The official, who declined to be identified as he is not unauthorized to speak to the media, said some 110,000 tonnes of fuel oil would be needed in April. Only two of South Korea’s major utilities, Korea East-West Power Co Ltd (EWP) and Korea Western Power Co (WP), issue tenders for fuel oil for power generation, mostly during peak summer and winter demand, data on Thomson Reuters Eikon shows. The two utilities declined to comment. Coal power generates about 40 percent of South Korea’s total electricity needs, nuclear around 30 percent, and natural gas meets 20 percent. The rest comes from oil and renewables. Even with the increase in fuel oil purchases, South Korea will have to raise imports of other fuels to meet demand as nearly half of its nuclear power plants are down for maintenance. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is the most likely to fill the gaps. Thomson Reuters Eikon data shows South Korea’s LNG shipments reached nearly 12 million tonnes between January and March 14, up 1.5 percent from the first quarter of last year.

2018-03-14,"(Agnia Grigas is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. The opinions expressed here are her own.) By Agnia Grigas March 14 (Reuters) - As another energy conflict is erupting between Russia and Ukraine, Moscow seeks to start construction of the second branch of the Nord Stream pipeline to deliver Russian natural gas directly to Germany. While the European Union countries remain divided, the United States needs to maintain its consistent and principled position to reduce Europe’s over-dependence on Russian natural gas. On March 2, Russian state gas company Gazprom announced that it would terminate all gas contracts with Ukraine’s energy company Naftogaz after a Stockholm arbitration court ordered Gazprom to pay more than $2.5 billion to Naftogaz for failing to uphold contractual obligations regarding volumes of transit gas through Ukraine. Gazprom’s apparent reprisal has increased European fears of a possible gas war in the midst of a cold winter; Ukraine has already closed schools to conserve energy and the EU is worried about its own gas supplies. These fears could play into Gazprom’s efforts to push through its Nord Stream 2, which Moscow presents as a simple business project to ensure Europe’s gas supply. To buy into this line of thinking, however, is to misunderstand the rationale for this project. Gazprom is not a commercial entity, but the right hand of the Kremlin, and Russia today is no ally of Europe but rather a sanctioned state engaged in war on the continent and bent on destabilizing the EU and NATO. Nord Stream 2 may give the Russian military a freer hand in Ukraine, impede the EU’s foreign policy and energy strategy, and increase Moscow’s influence over Germany’s political and business elites, thus aggravating divisions between Europe and the United States. Initially conceived in Moscow as a means of eliminating uncooperative transit countries from its gas business, the Nord Stream project gained momentum when Kiev started turning toward the West in the years following its 2004 Orange Revolution. The first Nord Stream pipeline was completed in 2011 and, following the annexation of Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine, Moscow has vowed to limit gas flows through Ukraine by the end of 2019. The Nord Stream 2 infrastructure would enable Gazprom to cut Ukraine out of gas transit traffic, which could cost the country about $2 billion in transit fees (the equivalent of nearly 6 percent of its projected budget for 2018). Revenues aside, as Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki recently stated in Berlin, the real danger lies in the fact that Russia can launch a massive land offensive against Ukraine without fear of damaging Ukraine’s pipeline infrastructure and interrupting Gazprom’s exports to Western countries. German Chancellor Angela Merkel disagrees with Morawiecki, saying that Nord Stream 2 is an economic project that poses no danger to energy diversification. German business interests see economic benefits if the country becomes a key European gas distribution hub for Russian gas. Likewise, Germany wants to ensure its gas supply as it is phasing out nuclear power. Unfortunately, completing Nord Stream 2 would go counter to the main principles of the EU’s energy and foreign policy strategy. It would challenge nearly two decades of Brussels’ efforts of trying to boost EU energy security by offering alternatives to Russian gas, such as pursuing the Southern Gas Corridor pipeline to bring Caspian gas to Europe, investing in LNG import terminals and pipeline interconnections, and increasing reliance on renewables, as well as supporting Ukraine and maintaining unity vis-à-vis Moscow. Germany does not seem to have learned any lessons from its history. As I write in my newest book on the geopolitics of gas, when German Chancellor Willy Brandt signed the country’s first gas contract with the Soviets in 1969, he considered such gas trade as part of his Ostpolitik: an economic policy toward the East that could reduce Cold War tensions and help reestablish contact with communist East Germany. But it was Washington’s military spending and containment policy – not the German marks that went to Moscow – that eventually bankrupted the Soviet Union and brought down the Berlin Wall. Washington should recall its own efforts during the Cold War era, when it tried to discourage its European allies from dependence on Soviet gas. President Ronald Reagan imposed sanctions on the USSR in late 1981 in response to Soviet martial law in Poland and also to block Soviet construction of the Urengoy-Uzhgorod pipeline that would have brought vast quantities of Siberian gas to Germany and Western Europe. In 1982 the administration extended sanctions to American energy equipment so it would not be used for the pipeline’s construction. Yet the effort failed to convince Europe and by late 1982 Washington cancelled the sanctions while the pipeline was built. Today, the United States faces a similar predicament. Washington’s July 2017 Russia sanctions threatened to target Nord Stream 2 but the most recent sanctions implemented in January 2018 did not do so explicitly. More recently, Poland has called for Nord Stream 2 to be included under U.S. sanctions. There is still time for President Donald Trump to try to achieve what Reagan could not and derail Russian pipeline plans. American sanctions against Nord Stream 2 would not be easy to implement given the resistance from countries like Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, and France. German support for future Russia sanctions is crucial, but getting Merkel to agree to add Nord Stream 2 to these measures seems unlikely. Instead, Washington should push Brussels to take a harder look at Nord Stream 2’s compliance with EU energy policy. While Washington today has less sway over its European allies than it did during the height of the Cold War, the United States can now offer Europe an alternative to Russian gas – American liquefied natural gas (LNG). American LNG has been exported to Europe since 2016 and expanded to include countries like Poland and Lithuania last year. The abundance of gas in the global markets due to the booming global LNG trade makes Nord Stream 2 less commercially or strategically necessary for Europeans. Already opinions have shifted in Europe. Denmark initially accepted Nord Stream, but has had a change of heart about its second phase. Danish legislators passed a law this year that could allow the government to ban Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from going through its waters for security reasons. Based on this new law, the Danish Energy Agency will likely release its decision on Nord Stream’s 2 application for permission to pass through Danish waters by the end of March. However as Danish sources told me on a recent visit, Copenhagen wants the EU to take the lead on any pipeline decision. This would prevent Denmark from damaging its relations with Germany and the United States and incurring the wrath of Russia. It would also prevent Russia from developing an alternative route to bypass Danish waters and eliminate the division emerging in the EU as some member states — the Czech Republic, Estonia, Croatia, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Romania and Slovakia — oppose the project. Fifty years since the first Soviet pipelines were laid to supply Western European countries with Soviet gas, the EU stands again at a crossroads in its energy policy. While security considerations and economic interests divide the EU countries, Washington should continue to make its opposition clear. Nord Stream 2 has no place in Europe’s long-term security and energy strategy.

2018-03-14,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Simmering political tensions roiled stocks and bonds across the globe on Wednesday, with U.S. yield curves continuing to flatten and stock markets closing in the red as industrial companies took a beating. Despite strong economic data out of China and the United States this week, markets struggled to shake a hangover from news that U.S. President Donald Trump was looking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports. On Wednesday, a White House spokeswoman said the Trump administration is pressing China to cut its trade surplus with the United States by $100 billion. Trump also spooked investors on Tuesday by firing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was viewed as a supporter of free trade. “There’s trade war talk going on,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. “We saw people taking profit amidst the uncertainty.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 248.91 points, or 1 percent, to end at 24,758.12, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 15.83 points, or 0.57 percent, to 2,749.48 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 14.20 points, or 0.19 percent, to 7,496.81. Additionally on Wednesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said it would retaliate after 23 of its diplomats were expelled by British Prime Minister Theresa May over a chemical attack on a former Russian double agent in England that May blamed on Moscow. That helped continue a trend of flattening yield curves on U.S. government bonds, with the spread between two- and 10-year Treasury yields down 3.2 basis points to 55.3 basis points.  The spread between five- and 30-year yields was down 3.8 basis points to 44.4 basis points. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR last rose 9/32 in price to yield 2.817 percent, from 2.848 percent late on Tuesday. The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last rose 28/32 in price to yield 3.056 percent, from 3.101 percent Tuesday. Germany’s 10-year government bond yield DE10YT=RR fell to a 1-1/2-month low on the trade war fears, while Italian borrowing costs rose after right-wing leader and aspiring prime minister Matteo Salvini reiterated his party’s view that the euro was a flawed currency.  Salvini also said he was open to forming any sort of coalition government as long as it did not include the Democratic Party. His comments, along with the ongoing trade war concerns, sent European stocks slightly into the red despite a banner day for Adidas and a strong showing for mining stocks. Adidas, the German sports fashion company, gained more than 11 percent on Wednesday after announcing a share buyback of up to 3 billion euros. Yet the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 0.14 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.46 percent. Wall Street’s losses were driven largely by plunges at industrial companies like Boeing (BA.N), which tumbled 2.5 percent, leading losers on the Dow. That was despite encouraging economic news that had spurred the U.S. indexes to open higher on Wednesday morning.  China reported industrial output expanding at a surprisingly faster pace at the start of the year. Fixed asset investment also beat forecasts, while retail sales improved. Political uncertainty outweighed that, said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. “Given the rearrangement that [Trump] has made to his cabinet ... it’s being read as a lot more protectionist now than it was two weeks ago.” Emerging market stocks .MSCIEF, meanwhile, lost 0.42 percent.  Oil prices were choppy, up slightly in the afternoon after losing ground through the morning.  U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 0.35 percent to $60.92 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $64.84, up 0.31 percent. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.1 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.18 percent to $1.2367.

2018-03-14,"(Fixes typo in second graf, removes extraneous letters) By Sophie Hares TEPIC, Mexico, March 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - M ayors from 21 U.S. cities including New York and Los Angeles backed a proposal calling for the federal government to better channel infrastructure funding, boost affordable housing and strengthen businesses and communities to withstand shocks. The Rockefeller Foundation-backed 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) initiative said its federal policy recommendations would help protect cities as they deal with problems like increasingly extreme weather events, social inequality and crime. “Cities have always taken responsibility for driving their own transformational policy changes to keep their residents safe and prosperous,” said Michael Berkowitz, 100RC president, in a statement. “But the nature of the challenges they will face in the 21st century – from catastrophic events like hurricanes, to long-term stressors like unemployment and violent crime – require an active and engaged federal government to help.” Responsible for 80 percent of global economic output and set to be home to two-thirds of the world’s people by 2050, many cities are grappling with how best to integrate and protect their booming populations. In the United States, city leaders have vowed to lead the drive to slash carbon emissions driving climate change, after President Donald Trump said he would pull the country out of the Paris climate change deal. The 100RC proposal urged the U.S. government to set up a national bank to fund investments aimed at making infrastructure more resilient, that would help cities pull in financing from the public and private sector. It also called for federal funding to help small businesses to better prepare for disasters and to recover after they hit. New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said efforts to tackle social inequality needed to run alongside moves to strengthen infrastructure in his flood-prone city. “Being resilient means more than having levees and wetlands to hold back water,” he said. “It also includes combating the long-standing, generational challenges around crime, education, income inequality and striking a balance between human needs and the environment that surrounds us.” Bolstering police forces, investing in crime prevention and ramping up schemes to reintroduce offenders to the community, would also benefit cities, along with improved support for violent crime victims, 100RC said. “Our cities and our nation are experiencing complex and unprecedented challenges, such as the increasing impacts of climate change and acute shortages of affordable housing,” said Jesse Arreguin, mayor of Berkeley, California. “Cities are leading the charge in addressing these and other urgent challenges.” The Rockefeller Foundation partners with the Thomson Reuters Foundation on resilience coverage.

2018-03-14,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices gained 0.4 percent in choppy trade on Wednesday, after a report showing a bigger-than-expected U.S. crude stock build was offset by large distillate and gasoline inventory draws. U.S. crude stocks rose by 5 million barrels, the biggest jump since late January, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. Expectations had been for a 2 million barrel build. But there was a larger-than-expected draw on fuel stocks. “We’re not pressuring the downside that much. Of course, the reason is because we had some unexpectedly large draws in distillates and gasoline that, when added together, are two times bigger than the crude build,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho.  Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 were up 25 cents, or 0.4 percent, to settle at $64.89 per barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures CLc1 also gained 25 cents, to settle at $60.96 per barrel.  “I don’t think we have a clear set of directions, and I don’t think this (EIA) report gives that much of an insight as to whether the rebalance continues or not. We continue to just chop around here,” said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy. Prices were pressured after The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said in its monthly report that supply from non-members is likely to grow by 1.66 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018, almost double the growth it predicted in November, largely due to rising U.S. supply. OPEC also said oil inventories across the most industrialized countries rose in January for the first time in eight months, a sign the impact of its output cuts may be waning. OPEC trimmed its 2018 demand forecast for its own crude by 250,000 bpd to 32.61 million bpd, a fourth consecutive decline. “According to the OPEC report, demand for OPEC’s oil must be 33 million barrels per day for the rest of the year to get rid of any remaining oversupply,” Commerzbank strategist Carsten Fritsch said. Oil prices got a boost early in the session from a broader investor push into commodities after Chinese data showed industrial production in the world’s largest importer of raw materials grew more than expected over the first two months of the year. Oil may also soon get some support from seasonal demand. “We are now only two to four weeks away from when weekly oil inventory data will start to draw again which should be supportive for oil prices,” SEB commodities strategist Bjarne Schieldrop said.

2018-03-14,"March 14 (Reuters) - Environmental regulators in West Virginia ordered Energy Transfer Partners LP to again halt work on its Rover natural gas pipeline in the state due to permit violations. These are just the latest of numerous permit violations that the $4.2 billion Rover pipeline has racked up since ETP started building the project in the first quarter of 2017. Rover is the biggest gas pipe under construction in the United States. It is designed to carry up to 3.25 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale fields in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to the U.S. Midwest and Canada’s Ontario province. One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. The West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) issued the order on March 5 following inspections in mid to late February. The state said inspectors observed 14 permit violations, including problems with storm water and trash. “We continue to work with ... the DEP to resolve any outstanding concerns,” ETP spokeswoman Alexis Daniel said. This is not the first time West Virginia stopped ETP from work on Rover. The DEP ordered the company to halt some work from July 17 to Aug. 9 due to violations of storm water rules. In addition, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission stopped ETP from horizontal drilling in Ohio from May 10 to Sept. 18 after an estimated 2 million gallons of drilling fluid spilled into a wetland near the Tuscarawas River. Energy companies use horizontal drilling to cross under obstacles such as rivers and highways. Before those stop work orders, ETP expected to finish Rover in November. ETP said it still expects to complete the project by the end of the second quarter of 2018. Rover has been partially in service since August and is now able to transport up to 1.7 bcfd. Some analysts, however, said it would be difficult for ETP to complete Rover that soon. “ETP has said in filings that it plans to conduct some horizontal drilling in April and May, making it more likely that they will not finish the project until the third quarter,” said Peter Busk, a research analyst at energy research firm East Daley Capital in Centennial, Colorado. Major producers that signed up to use Rover include units of privately held Ascent Resources, Antero Resources Corp, Range Resources Corp, Southwestern Energy Co, Eclipse Resources Corp and EQT Corp.

2018-03-14,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - President Michel Temer said on Wednesday that Brazil will respond with caution to planned U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum to avoid hurting ties with its second-largest trade partner. But if talks fail, the president emphasized, Brazil will not hesitate to take a complaint to the World Trade Organization. Temer urged Brazilian steel producers and their U.S. clients to work together in lobbying the U.S. government and Congress to modify the tariffs announced last week by President Donald Trump. “We have to treat our relations with the United States with great care, because they are our biggest trade partner after China,” Temer said, speaking at the opening of the World Economic Forum on Latin America. If there is no “friendly” solution. Brazil will join other countries in filing a complaint at the WTO. Foreign Minister Aloysio Nunes said at the same event that he has written to the U.S. Trade Representative requesting a meeting on the tariffs. The government said last week the tariffs will strongly hamper Brazilian exports to the United States and are incompatible with U.S. obligations toward the WTO.  Brazil said it would not rule out retaliation if the WTO ruled against the U.S. tariffs. U.S. coal producers that export coal used to make Brazilian steel are one potential ally in lobbying for an exemption. Brazilian steelmaker Companhia Siderurgica Nacional SA (CSNA3.SA), which sells 6 percent of its output in the U.S. market, shrugged of potential tariffs on Wednesday and said it would sell more on the domestic market as Brazil’s economy picks up, and look to export more to China.

2018-03-14,"* U.S. yield curve flattens on soft data, Washington shakeup * Wall Street slips as industrials lag * Trade war threat drives demand for high-grade euro zone bonds (Updates with U.S. trading; changes byline and dateline) By Nick Brown NEW YORK, March 14 (Reuters) - Simmering fears of a global trade war on Wednesday overshadowed robust data from China and kept government bond yields low in the U.S. and Europe, with U.S. stocks sinking into the red amid a drop in industrial shares. U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, seen as a free-trade proponent, replacing him with the more hawkish former Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo. Later on Tuesday, Reuters reported that the U.S. was seeking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports. The news contributed to a continued flattening on Wednesday of the U.S. yield curve, a move also aided by a third consecutive monthly decrease in retail sales data. The spread between five-year notes and 30-year bonds, an indicator of the shape of the yield curve, lowered to 44.9 basis points on Wednesday, 3 basis points below its last close. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 11/32 in price to yield 2.8079 percent, from 2.848 percent late on Tuesday. “Long-term, continuing rate hikes will keep the flattening going,” said Michael Cloherty, head of U.S. rates strategy at RBC Securities in New York, though in the short-term, he said, “we’re a little flatter than we should be.” In Europe, high-rated government bond yields edged higher but remained near recent lows. German 10-year government bond yields seesawed in midday trades, falling to a one-and-a-half-month low at 11:25 a.m. ET. Positive news from China spurred higher openings on Wall Street, but the main stock indexes could not weather political fears as trading wore on. China reported industrial output expanding at a surprisingly faster pace at the start of the year. Fixed asset investment also beat forecasts, while retail sales improved. That came on the heels of consumer price data on Tuesday that pointed to annual U.S. core inflation steady at 1.8 percent, cementing investors’ expectations that the Federal Reserve would not raise rates more than three times in 2018. But dips in industrial stocks, including a 4.4 percent drop in shares of Boeing sent U.S. stocks reeling in morning trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 240.62 points, or 0.96 percent, to 24,766.41, the S&P 500 lost 11.3 points, or 0.41 percent, to 2,754.01 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 20.44 points, or 0.27 percent, to 7,490.58. “The market is still trying to weigh concerns about tariffs on one hand and understanding how the President acts and how he speaks openly and comes up with a different policy in the end,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.10 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.39 percent. Emerging market stocks lost 0.49 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.34 percent lower, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.87 percent. The Chinese data spurred an early spike for oil, before prices dropped later. U.S. crude fell 0.36 percent to $60.49 per barrel and Brent was last at $64.50, down 0.22 percent on the day. In currencies, the dollar index rose 0.18 percent, with the euro down 0.26 percent to $1.2357. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.38 percent versus the greenback at 106.17 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3928, down 0.22 percent on the day.

2018-03-14,"(Adds Iranian oil minister) BEIRUT, March 14 (Reuters) - Iran and Russia signed a deal on Wednesday to develop two oilfields in Iran, according to Iranian state TV. The National Iranian Oil Company signed a deal with Russia’s Zarubezhneft to develop the fields, according to SHANA, the news site of the Iranian oil ministry. “This is a very important point. This is the first time that we are signing a deal to develop oilfields with a prominent Russian company,” Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said at the signing ceremony. He added, “We hope that it won’t be the last deal. It was a difficult negotiation and I say congratulations to both parties.” The Aban and Paydar-e Gharb fields are both in western Iran and jointly owned by Iran and Iraq, according to SHANA. Their combined oil output is currently 36,000 barrels per day. The 10-year agreement is intended to boost the production of the fields to 48,000 bpd. The fields are expected to produce 67 million barrels of oil during the ten years, SHANA reported. Zarubezhneft has an 80 percent share in the deal and its Iranian partner, Dana Energy, the remaining 20 percent. The cost of developing the fields is estimated at $674 million, with an additional $68 million in indirect costs, according to SHANA. Zanganeh said Iran was currently in the middle of negotiations with other Russian energy companies including Gazprom, Lukoil and Rosneft.

2018-03-14,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s main opposition party said on Wednesday it would support the government’s plan to adopt European Union energy rules, likely securing the law’s passage and allowing the European Union outsider to remain a full member of EU markets. However, Labour’s support may come with the condition that all power cables should be state-owned, raising questions about the future of NorthConnect, a planned 2 billion-euro power cable between Norway and Scotland. For the past 24 years, Norwegian companies have enjoyed market access on equal terms with companies in the EU via the European Economic Area treaty, in return for the country’s adoption of EU common market regulations. The centre-right minority government feared that rejecting the EU’s Third Energy Package, designed to enhance energy flows and improve regulatory oversight, would put Norway on a slippery slope to a Brexit-like ending of its close EU relations. Norway’s parliament is expected to vote on the package on March 22, said a spokesman for the oil and energy ministry. Trade unions and several centrist and left-wing parties have opposed the regulation, believing Norway could lose control of its abundant hydroelectric resources. However, the opposition Labour Party, the biggest party in Norway’s parliament, said it would back the proposal in return for government guarantees of continued public-sector ownership of most power production and infrastructure. Under the EEA treaty, Norway retains the right to refuse the adoption of EU rules, but has never done so as this would allow the EU to retaliate by suspending other parts of the agreement. Norway is working on three cables, two of which are under construction by state-owned grid Statnett [STASF.UL] and will export electricity to Britain and Germany. Plans for a third cable to Scotland, called NorthConnect, could come under scrutiny as it is backed by a private consortium consisting of Norway’s Agder Energi [AGDER.UL], Lyse[LYSEK.UL] and E-CO as well as Sweden’s Vattenfall [VATN.UL]. “If this goes through, NorthConnect must be taken over by Statnett or it will be very difficult to realise the project,” Leiv Ingve Oerke, Lyse’s head of energy business, told Reuters. Cancelling the 1.4 gigawatt cable will mean all subsidies that European Union so far spent on it will be lost, he added. Labour is also asking that any decision on a cable built after the first two should be made after they are completed and have been assessed. Statnett, which in January said NorthConnect should be delayed as it may overburden the existing power infrastructure in the Nordics, declined to comment. The government did not want to comment on the final outcome of its talks with the opposition, a ministry spokesman said.

2018-03-14,"WOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) core VW autos division said on Wednesday that EU requirements on curbing emissions and other climate-related demands would cause profitability to stall between 2018 and 2020. Profits would be hit even as earnings, sales and deliveries at the German firm were forecast to hit new records this year, VW brand executives told a media briefing. The European Union has proposed tougher vehicle emissions targets for 2025 and 2030 to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases. Carmakers, which are racing to develop electric vehicles (EVs), can be fined for violating the limits. The VW brand shoulders the bulk of Volkswagen group’s development spending, as well as costs related to the “dieselgate” emissions scandal. VW finance chief Arno Antlitz said VW faced “heavy financial demands” due to bottlenecks expected from introducing so-called WLTP lab tests related to car emissions and fuel consumption, regulations to curb CO2 emissions and EV development costs. “The CO2 fleet targets will certainly pose the greatest challenge for us as a company until the year 2020,” VW brand chief executive Herbert Diess said. Carmakers are working on new EV models to meet emissions goals. VW aims to sell more than 1 million cars powered solely by batteries by 2025, after selling just 43,000 electric models in 2017.         The VW brand, Volkswagen’s largest division by sales and revenue, more than doubled its return on sales to 4.1 percent on the back of cuts in research and development spending, lower production costs and rising sales of sport utility vehicles, which deliver higher margins. The carmaker said its operating margin might come in between 4 and 5 percent this year, a range it said it would also maintain in 2020, the year before a new lower limit of 95 grams of CO2 per km takes effect. “This year and over the next few years, the brand will face severe challenges despite its improved competitiveness,” VW said. But Diess said VW expected to benefit from further cost savings, expansion of modular production and growing demand for its new vehicle models in the Americas.

2018-03-14,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar launched a five-year development plan on Wednesday that focuses on making the tiny country more self-reliant in the face of a boycott by other Arab states. The National Development Strategy for 2018-2022 pledges to “rationalise energy consumption and encourage development of renewable energy while raising self-sufficiency levels for farming and fishing production”. The 333-page plan, released by Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser al-Thani, aims for Qatar to satisfy 30 percent of its demand for farm animals and 65 percent of its demand for fish domestically by 2022, partly through fish farms.  The document does not give figures for Qatar’s current level of self-sufficiency in these areas, but the desert country of 2.7 million is heavily dependent on food imports. Only 6 percent of its land is arable, the document says. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of backing terrorism, a charge which Doha denies. The boycott disrupted Qatar’s imports, many of which used to come across its border with Saudi Arabia, and triggered the withdrawal of billions of dollars from Qatari banks by depositors from the four states. Qatar’s economy and financial markets were hurt as imports plunged about 40 percent from a year earlier in the first weeks of the boycott. But the world’s top exporter of liquefied natural gas developed new trade routes and deployed tens of billions of dollars from its sovereign wealth fund, estimated to have about $320 billion of assets, to protect its banks. Gross domestic product data for the third quarter of 2017 showed the economy had largely recovered from the boycott and was again growing robustly. Efforts to make Qatar more self-sufficient began within weeks of the boycott starting, as a privately owned local company with government support, Baladna, flew in 3,400 cows on state airline Qatar Airways. It plans to build a herd of 14,000, housing them in sheds cooled by fans and jets of mist. There have been few signs of any resolution to the diplomatic dispute, and a senior UAE official has said Qatar’s isolation could last years. In January, Qatar filed a complaint to the United Nations about an alleged violation of its airspace by a UAE military aircraft; the UAE denied any violation. Other parts of the five-year development plan deal with social conditions, such as encouraging Qatari citizens to play sport and improving the health of young people.

2018-03-14,"(Adds detail, quotes) WARSAW, March 14 (Reuters) - State-run Polish utility Tauron expects to increase its capital spending by more than 4 billion zlotys ($1.2 billion) this year and has no plans to sell its heating assets, company officials said on Wednesday. With debt totalling 9.72 billion zlotys, Tauron is the most indebted of Poland’s four biggest state-run energy groups. Newspaper Dziennik Gazeta Prawna reported last month that some of Tauron’s assets, including heating plants or coal mines, could be taken over by its bigger rivals as part of a wider plan of consolidating the power sector. “Due to its financial situation Tauron needs a broad base of regulated assets. We do not foresee any steps in the area,” Tauron’s Chief Executive Filip Grzegorczyk told a press conference on Wednesday when asked whether Tauron would consider selling its heating assets. He was less certain about whether Tauron might sell some of its coal mines. “At the moment we are not familiar with the owner’s plans or decisions regarding potential takeover of our mines by PGG,” Grzegorczyk said when asked whether some of Tauron’s mines could be acquired by state-run coal miner PGG. Tauron’s net debt to EBITDA ratio stood at 2.27 at the end of 2017 and will still be below 3 at the end of this year, Chief Financial Officer Marek Wadowski said. Capex would top 4 billion zlotys, up from 3.5 billion zlotys in 2017, he said. Tauron, which assumes a 10 percent increase in coal prices this year, expects that its EBITDA in 2018 will be similar to 3.5 billion zlotys reported for 2017. “We expect the good macro situation in Poland to continue, which should translate into an increase in volumes of power delivered to clients,” Wadowski also said. The company said power consumption in Poland rose by around 2 percent last year, on the back of 4.5 percent economic growth. Shares in Tauron have fallen by 16 percent since the start of the year, reducing the company’s market capitalization to 4.46 billion zlotys. They were down 0.4 percent at 1432 GMT. $1 = 3.4079 zlotys

Operations at the Avana and Bai Hassan fields have been halted since October, when Iraqi forces took them back after they had been under Kurdish control since 2014. Oil exports from Kirkuk fields have been suspended amid an ongoing dispute between Baghdad and the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) over the use of the Ceyhan export pipeline to Turkey. Iraqi oil officials said there were no plans to resume crude flow through the Kurdish-owned pipeline, as no agreement had been reached yet. “Until this moment we didn’t reach any kind of agreement, even an initial, with Kurdish authorities to resume Kirkuk oil exports to Ceyhan,” said an oil ministry official. The Kurdish region operates a pipeline that connects to the twin Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline at Khabur on the border with Turkey. Iraq started late last year to divert output from Kirkuk oilfields to local refineries to boost fuel production and help free up more oil for exports from the southern oilfields.

2018-03-14,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC on Wednesday raised its forecast for non-member oil supply this year to almost double the growth predicted four months ago as higher prices spur U.S. shale drilling, offsetting OPEC-led output cuts and a collapse in Venezuelan production. In a monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said non-OPEC producers would boost supply by 1.66 million barrels per day in 2018. That was the fourth straight rise from 870,000 bpd forecast in November. “For 2018, higher growth is expected on the back of the projected increase in U.S. shale production following a better price environment not only for shale producers, but also for other countries such as Canada, the UK, Brazil and China,” OPEC said of the outlook for non-OPEC supply.     This would lead to “a higher quarterly distribution throughout the year with a record-high level projected for the fourth quarter”, OPEC said. OPEC, Russia and several other non-OPEC producers, but not the United States, began to cut supply in January 2017 in an effort to erase a global glut of crude that had built up since 2014. They have extended the pact until the end of 2018. The deal has helped boost oil prices LCOc1, which topped $71 a barrel this year for the first time since 2014 and were near $65 on Wednesday. But it has also encouraged a flood of shale, fuelling a debate about the curbs’ effectiveness.  Oil pared much of an earlier gain on Wednesday after the release of the OPEC report. The Iranian oil minister said OPEC could agree at its next meeting in June to start easing the curbs in 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported. He also said OPEC should aim for oil around $60 to contain shale growth. Top exporter Saudi Arabia, however, said in February it was premature to discuss an exit strategy. Faster-than-expected growth in demand due to a robust world economy has added a tailwind to the OPEC supply effort. Although OPEC in the report slightly raised its estimate of growth in world demand to 1.6 million bpd, it now projects the expansion in supply outside the group will exceed gains in demand. This brings OPEC’s view closer to that of the International  Energy Agency, which expects a less rosy 2018 supply/demand balance. While rivals are pumping more, OPEC’s production in February fell, according to the report. Total output dropped by 77,000 bpd to 32.186 million bpd, led by declines in Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela, according to figures OPEC collects from secondary sources. Adherence by the 12 OPEC members with output targets rose to 147 percent, according to a Reuters calculation based on the OPEC figures, higher than 137 percent in January based on last month’s report.  The figures that OPEC members reported themselves showed some deeper declines in production. Venezuela, whose output is dropping amid an economic crisis, told OPEC its production sank by about 183,000 bpd to 1.586 million bpd in February. The number is believed to be the lowest in decades.  With outside producers expected to increase supply by more than demand, OPEC cut its estimate of the global requirement for its crude in 2018 by 250,000 bpd to 32.61 million bpd. Should OPEC keep pumping at February’s level and other things remain equal, the market could move into a deficit of about 420,000 bpd, suggesting inventories will be drawn down. This is less than the deficit of about 560,000 bpd implied last month. The supply cut’s original aim was to shrink oil inventories in developed economies to their five-year average. The latest figures gave a mixed picture on stock movements. Stocks rose by 13.7 million barrels in January to 2.865 billion barrels, although this was only 50 million above the five-year average, the closest yet OPEC has come to the original target. OPEC is now talking of looking at other metrics to assess the market’s rate of return to balance.

2018-03-14,"HOUSTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. energy pipeline developers say they intend to pursue exemptions to the Trump Administration’s proposed steel tariffs, as concerns grow for those companies and from key exporters to the United States like South Korea. “We have a number of pipeline projects that would be impacted significantly by this cost increase,” said Adam Bedard, chief executive of Arb Midstream, an energy transportation and marketing company. If exemptions become available, “we’d certainly try and qualify for it.” He was referring to the U.S. Commerce Department’s effort to devise a procedure for companies to apply to avoid paying a 25 percent tariff on imported steel or 10 percent on imported aluminum.   Commerce has 10 days to come up with the procedure to apply for exemptions from the steel and aluminum tariff declaration issued last week. There is a national security exemption for U.S. companies to buy steel items that domestic manufacturers do not produce in the volumes or quality required. The president also said exemptions would be available to certain countries.     Imports account for 77 percent of the steel used in U.S. pipelines, according to a 2017 study conducted for the pipeline industry. Some manufacturers already have customers waiting two years for pipeline to construct lines to carry shale oil and gas from West Texas fields to U.S. Gulf Coast export hubs.  Energy trade associations fought for a way around the tariff. They argued that U.S. manufacturers either do not offer key metal grades or diameters, or have long production times that would impede development of shale oil and gas pipelines.  NAmerico Partners LP, which is proposing a multibillion dollar pipeline to move natural gas from west Texas to the U.S. Gulf Coast, estimates the steel tariff would raise the cost to its customers by between 2 percent and 4 percent. “We will do everything we are capable of to limit the impact to our shippers,” said Jeff Welch, the company’s managing partner. NAmerico has not yet made the final decision to begin construction of the 468-mile (753 kilometer) pipeline, he said. Even with exemptions, tariffs could still raise costs and slow down projects, said Nicolas Adrian McTyre, an Austin, Texas attorney and former trial attorney for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. “You are looking at a new regulatory hurdle potentially and there are a lot of unknowns to that process currently.”  One of the primary providers of steel for pipeline companies is South Korea. Manufacturers there have said they are considering sending exports to other parts of the world due to difficulties with shipping to the United States, even before the tariffs go into effect. John Stoody, a spokesman for the U.S. Association of Oil Pipe Lines, said at least one member firm, which he did not name, tried to buy steel from South Korea in recent days, but was rebuffed due to tariff uncertainty. “Foreign pipe sellers are hesitant to sell pipe,” he said. Executives at steel companies in South Korea say the move is nudging them toward non-U.S. markets. Seah Steel (003030.KS), whose sales to the United States account for 20 percent of total revenue, is exploring other markets, a company official said.   Trump’s tariff “will inevitably impact our exports, and make it necessary for us to find a new channel for exports,” the Seah official said. He declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Seah acquired two U.S. plants in 2016 to reduce any tariff burden, according to the company, but still has to rely on its Korean manufacturing lines for U.S. sales. The U.S. Commerce Department said in April 2017 that it had found that Korean steel producers had been unfairly dumping OCTG in the U.S. market.  Imports of oil country tubular goods (OCTG) from South Korea - which includes drill pipes, casing and tubings - were valued at about $1.1 billion for the mid-2014 to mid-2015 period it examined. That accounted for nearly 25 percent of all OCTG U.S. imports, ahead of all other countries, Commerce said at the time.      Commerce responded by raising duties as high as 24.9 percent from a previous range of about 4 percent to 6.5 percent. “The best case is to get exempted but there’s nothing else we can say,” said Park Hoon, CEO of Husteel, on the sidelines of a meeting between Korean government officials and industry executives to discuss the tariffs.  He said nearly 80 percent of the company’s business relies on U.S. sales, and the company also is looking to other export markets.

2018-03-14,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - A Ugandan male lawmaker has provoked outrage among rights activists by exhorting men to beat their wives in order to discipline them, in comments carried by a Ugandan TV channel. Onesmus Twinamasiko’s remarks followed a speech by President Yoweri Museveni on Women’s Day on March 8 in which he condemned assaults on women by husbands and called it cowardly.  “As a man, you need to discipline your wife,” the lawmaker told local NTV Uganda in an interview on March 10.   “You need to, you know, touch her a bit and you tackle her and you beat her somehow, you know, to really streamline her.” The majority Christian East African country is conservative and, as in many countries on the continent, homosexuality is illegal. But physical abuse of women is a crime under laws that penalise various forms of assault. The remarks have since triggered mostly condemnation online and in the Ugandan press.  Onesmus responded in an interview with the BBC on Monday that slaps are “fine” but “beatings which cause injuries or death” are unacceptable. He also told Reuters that he was being comic and that his remarks were misunderstood.  “It is a shock that an honourable member of parliament ... could mention such words that justified violence,” said Diana Kagere Mugerwa, program officer at Uganda’s Centre for Domestic Violence Prevention.  She also said he should make a public apology to women and the nation “because he is abrogating the constitution that he swore to protect.” Writing by Elias Biryabarema, Editing by William Maclean",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uganda-genderviolence-mp/ugandan-legislator-lauds-wife-beating-stirs-outrage-idUKL8N1QW4EO,14 Mar 2018,"A Ugandan male lawmaker has

2018-03-14,"SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria has chosen Russian Aircraft Corporation MiG (RSK MiG) to overhaul and maintain its 15 ageing, Soviet-made MiG-29 fighter jets until 2022, Defence Ministry documents show. The Black Sea state is a member of the European Union and NATO but deemed RSK MiG the only supplier able to provide reliable support for its MiG 29s, which date to when Sofia was part of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact alliance in the 1980s. Bulgaria therefore did not invite other bidders for the deal. Sofia has said it needs to keep its Soviet-era aircraft operational after plans to buy eight new fighter jets from a fellow NATO state hit a procedural snag. The process is expected to start almost from scratch later this year. The Defence Ministry planned to sign a four-year, 81.3-million-lev ($51.45 million) deal with RSK MiG in December but put it off following an appeal by Ukrainian arms exporter Ukrinmash. Bulgaria’s anti-monopoly commission later rejected Ukraine’s appeal and a special Defence Ministry commission approved RSK MiG’s offer on March 6, according to the documents posted on the ministry’s website.   Some eastern European NATO allies that were once Soviet satellites still rely on Russian-made military jets - two-thirds of Poland’s military equipment dates from the pre-1991 Soviet era, for example. But NATO has encouraged eastern European members to develop, buy and operate new alliance weaponry compatible with older Soviet-era systems. The question of which warplanes Bulgaria should buy has been vexing successive governments for more than a decade. Sofia has said that between 2018 and 2022 it wants to upgrade to bring its fighter jets closer to compliance with NATO standards.

2018-03-14,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian gas giant Gazprom will cut hundreds of jobs at its overseas trading and export offices, including Britain, and move them to St Petersburg, according to two sources familiar with the plan, which comes at a time of rising tensions with the West.  One of the sources said the decision reflected a broader trend of Russian state firms retreating from the West as part of President Vladimir Putin’s drive to repatriate capital to reduce exposure to sanctions and also shore up the domestic economy.      “In Russia, this story can be sold as a job creation exercise on home turf. This is useful, especially ahead of the presidential election,” said the source, referring to the vote on Sunday that Putin is widely expected to win. The reorganization comes as relations between Russia and Britain, where Gazprom has the largest trading office by far, have hit a new low after Prime Minister Theresa May said Moscow was to blame for the attempted murder a former Russian double agent in an English city. However the jobs decision was taken earlier this year, long before the spy scandal erupted, according to the sources who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.  Gazprom, which has its headquarters in St Petersburg, said it was too early to comment on numbers and moves. The company last month that it planned to reorganize its overseas trading and export operations but gave no details. “This work is aimed at strengthening the company’s position abroad,” a spokesman said. Gazprom’s overseas trading and exports divisions employ around 2,000 people, with the bulk of them - around 1,000 - in London. It also has offices in locations including Paris, Houston, Singapore and cities in Germany. Not all employees are traders, as they also include finance and logistics specialists. The reorganization will see the number of people more than halved, while about the same number of people will be hired in St Petersburg from where many trading operations will be executed, according to one of the sources who did not give more specific details about where the cuts would happen. Since setting up Gazprom’s trading offices in London in 2005, Gazprom has hired dozens of top traders from rival companies such as Total and Gunvor.  Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 triggered a series of U.S. and EU sanctions against the Kremlin and its companies, and ties have worsened further after Russia was accused of meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Russian state banks such as VTB and companies such as Rosneft have since scaled back their presence in the West, while some of Putin’s closest allies such as businessman Gennady Timchenko have sold their assets in the West and repatriated capital to Russia. The West has repeatedly accused Putin of using Gazprom as a economic and political weapon after the gas behemoth cut supplies to Ukraine, thus disrupting deliveries to Europe. Moscow denies that charge. Europe gets a third of its gas from Russia, and Gazprom has spent 15 years on building a mighty trading division to help it further boost that share.  The plan to move Gazprom’s trading headquarters from London to St Petersburg was first considered by the company’s management in 2015 but it was put on ice due to concerns about an exodus of people and the difficulties of raising credit for a capital-intensive operation, according to Gazprom sources.

Austria’s largest utility plans to pay a dividend of 0.42 euros per share for 2017, lifting its shares more than 11 percent to their highest in more than six years. Verbund, which generates its electricity almost exclusively from renewable sources such as hydropower, expects adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 850 million euros ($1.05 billion) this year. That would mark a further decline after an 11.7 percent drop to 922 million euros in 2017. Like many of its rivals, the majority state-owned group is facing a slump in power prices and challenges, including European regulators’ decision to split up a joint power zone with Germany. From October 2018, capacity on the border with Germany will no longer be unlimited and billions of euros in forward contracts will have to be settled differently. Verbund has prepared for this by adjusting its trading systems and resources, amending contracts and modifying procurement practices. “Verbund considers itself to be optimally positioned in light of the radical changes in conditions,” it said in its annual report. Rivalry from Germany increased further after E.ON and RWE agreed a landmark deal which will transform RWE into Europe’s third-largest renewables group and E.ON into the continent’s largest network and retail energy player. In response to the many challenges, Verbund is expanding into new business areas. In cooperation with oil and gas group OMV it is setting up a comprehensive charging infrastructure for electric cars in Austria. Together with Siemens and steelmaker Voestalpine it is building a hydrogen power plant. Verbund is also working on further reducing debt, which stood at 2.84 billion euros at the end of 2017, down around 12 percent from a year earlier. Last year’s earnings decrease was largely due to non-recurring write-offs, a stake sale in its electric vehicle charging company Smatrics and an obligation to return an interest in a power plant, Verbund said. It plans to pay out 40-45 percent of its 2018 adjusted group result, which it expects to come in at around 300 million euros, to its shareholders.

2018-03-14,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Commodities merchant Noble Group (NOBG.SI) has finalised a restructuring agreement with a group of senior creditors holding 46 percent of its debt, and is in talks with others, as it races to launch a deal crucial to its survival. The embattled firm has been negotiating a $3.4 billion debt-for-equity swap for months, after selling billions of dollars of assets, taking hefty writedowns and cutting hundreds of jobs over the past three years.  Hong Kong-headquartered Noble, once Asia’s biggest commodity trader with ambitions to take on global giants such as Glencore (GLEN.L), also outlined steps it would take if the deal doesn’t go through. If shareholders do not approve the deal, the restructuring will be completed by “moving the group’s center of main interests to the United Kingdom, seeking the appointment of an English administrator to sell all of the assets of the company to New Noble,” Noble said, referring to a restructured company. Noble’s Restructuring Support Agreement (RSA) has been signed by creditors known as the Ad Hoc Group and the firm is seeking support from another senior creditor, Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), and trade finance provider, ING Bank, Noble said. Joseph Swanson, senior managing director at Houlihan Lokey, financial adviser to the Ad Hoc Group, said the signing of the agreement was a landmark moment for Noble, and the Ad Hoc Group was looking forward to getting consent from creditors outside the core group.  Noble said the Ad Hoc Group was also in contact with other senior creditors who were holding an additional 15 percent of claims and had indicated their broad support for the deal. Noble is seeking to halve its senior debt and hand over 70 percent of the restructured business to the Ad Hoc Group. It said on Wednesday that existing equity holders could be diluted to 15 percent, marking an improvement for equity holders from earlier discussions of the deal. Company management could end up owning 15 percent.  Noble’s debt restructuring deal has been opposed by some bondholders and shareholders such as Goldilocks Investment Co, an Abu Dhabi Financial Group equity fund. IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication, reported that the restructuring proposal requires a vote of senior creditors holding at least 75 percent of its debt, of which 75 percent must vote in favor for the measure to pass.  Founded in 1986 by Richard Elman, who rode a commodities bull run to build one of the world’s biggest traders, Noble was plunged into crisis in February 2015 when Iceberg Research questioned its books. Noble has defended its accounting. Noble’s market value has fallen to just S$223 million ($170 million) from $6 billion in February 2015. The company has a $379 million bond that matures on March 20. Noble said Deutsche Bank has signed the RSA, and ING Bank was in the process of signing it. Together, they represent 4 percent of Noble’s claims. Noble plans to launch its restructuring this month and said senior creditors keen to participate in the trade financing deal had to sign up by April 6.

2018-03-14,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2HyJ1yX By John Kemp LONDON, March 14 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s decision to replace his secretary of state with a more hawkish figure should have been bullish for oil prices since it increases the probability the nuclear deal with Iran will be abandoned in May. Failure to recertify the deal could lead to the re-imposition of secondary sanctions and pressure from the United States on other countries to reduce their purchases of Iranian crude again. But the decision to replace the secretary of state barely registered on the spot price of Brent crude and the six-month calendar spread continued to soften, suggesting that traders see little impact for the moment. In theory, failure to recertify could remove hundreds of thousands of barrels of crude from the market and cause a significant tightening of the supply-demand balance. For the time being, however, the Trump administration’s increasingly hawkish position on Iran has not been enough to offset the impact of increasing supply from shale. Crude traders may be under-estimating the president’s determination to end what he has termed a “terrible” deal and ratchet up the pressure on Iran. But the president and his new secretary of state, assuming the nominee is confirmed by the U.S. Senate, will still face the same diplomatic constraints in ending the deal and renewing the boycott of Iranian oil. European countries, including Britain, France and Germany, are no more eager than before to abandon the nuclear deal or re-impose broad economic sanctions. Russia is also unlikely to cooperate since relations and cooperation with the United States are at the lowest ebb since the end of the Cold War. And the United States has embarked on a trade war with China, which is further complicating a relationship already beset by multiple other disputes. In the circumstances, traders may have concluded even a failure to recertify the deal will not lead to the removal of a significant amount of crude from the market. They may also have concluded any loss of crude from Iran would be made up by increased production and exports from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq and Russia. Compliance with the OPEC/non-OPEC output curbs has left all these countries with actual or potential spare capacity to increase production to offset any loss from Iran. Corporate tax cuts approved by the U.S. Congress and the president at the end of 2017 have been broadly welcomed by investors and the business community. Tax reductions for businesses and many individual taxpayers should increase the economy’s productive potential as well as stimulating short-term consumption and investment. Overall, the tax reductions should have a positive impact on economic growth and oil consumption in the short term, which should be bullish for oil prices. But the medium term impact is more uncertain because tax reductions are boosting the economy at a time when the business cycle already appears relatively mature. The fiscal stimulus may be accelerating the final stages of the economic cycle and bringing forward the date of the next recession. The current expansion is already the third-longest on record and it will become the second-longest in May 2018 and the longest in July 2019. The business and financial community has broadly welcomed the tax cuts even if it has doubts about other elements of the president’s programme. But the departure of the president’s chief economic adviser and the secretary of state have unsettled the same business leaders who have vocally supported the administration on tax. Most business leaders are opposed to the president’s more populist and nationalist policies even as they support his tax cutting. There is little enthusiasm among business leaders and investors for increased tariffs, tougher restrictions on investment and “de-globalisation”. The administration’s more hawkish and nationalist turn in recent weeks may therefore be fuelling increased concern about the medium-term economic outlook with negative implications for oil demand and prices. Benchmark crude oil prices and calendar spreads have been softening slowly but steadily for the last two months. Global oil consumption is growing rapidly and inventories have fallen, but supply is now expected to increase by more than 2 million barrels per day in 2018. Production from the U.S. shale fields is surging in response to the increase in prices and drilling since the middle of last year. Coupled with extra oil from Canada, Brazil and Norway, production should be more than enough to meet the rise in demand in 2018. Brent spot prices and calendar spreads had been rallying strongly since the end of June 2017 in the expectation the market would move into a sustained supply deficit. But the surge in shale production has made that much less likely and traders have started to revise their expectations for a deficit in the second half of the year. The shift has flowed through into spot prices and more importantly into spreads, which track the supply-demand balance closely. Brent spot prices and spreads have essentially shown no net increase since the middle of December as the earlier rally has stalled (tmsnrt.rs/2HyJ1yX). For the moment, traders see the enormous increase in non-OPEC oil supply this year outweighing any threat from the failure to recertify the Iran deal in May. Hedge fund managers had accumulated a record bullish position in futures and options contracts linked to the price of crude and refined fuels by the middle of January. Some of those positions amounting to around 250 million barrels have been gradually liquidated over the last six weeks, which has kept oil prices under pressure. But hedge funds and other money managers still hold an overall bullish position in crude and fuels amounting to more than 1.2 billion barrels. Bullish positions outnumber bearish ones by a ratio of 10:1. With so many bullish positions overhanging the market, it is proving hard for prices to rally, despite the Trump administration’s increasingly hard-line position on Iran.

2018-03-14,"(Reuters) - After almost three barren years for investors who have poured millions into the U.S. oil sector, producers are finally opening the floodgates to a wave of share buybacks that will return money to shareholders this year. U.S. oil production topped 10 million barrels per day earlier this year, approaching a record set in 1970, but until recently many investors in the shale oil revolution were still waiting for their payday. (here) Since the beginning of year, 11 companies have promised buybacks, with six alone in the past three weeks including Devon Energy (DVN.N), Hess Corp (HES.N) and Noble Energy Inc (NBL.N). In all, companies have committed to buy back about $3.6 billion worth of shares since February.  (Graphic - Buyback mania: reut.rs/2Gq50ZF) The United States’ second largest producer Chevron Corp (CVX.N) also weighed in last week, hinting it would start buying back shares if it produced stronger cash flow in 2018. The payouts come courtesy of a combination of higher and more stable oil prices and pressure from investors. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) CLc1 has more than doubled, crossing $60 per barrel. Back in Feb. 11, 2016, oil fell to $26.05, its lowest in 13 years.  “There was a time when the consensus was that we’d be stuck at around $45 a barrel for oil, and obviously conditions have improved since then,” said Derek Rollingson, a portfolio manager at ICON Advisers.  “There is a disconnect between commodity prices and returns from exploration and production companies.”  Before oil started to take a downturn in 2014, energy companies had spent billions of dollars in exploration and new projects. When oil fell below $30, producers in North America sought to raise cash by selling more shares, pushing down stock prices. The S&P 500 Energy Index .SPNY is down about 32 percent since mid-2014, when oil prices topped $100 a barrel. Wall Street finally put its foot down last year (here), with investors demanding a shift to dividends and share buybacks. Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) was punished for ignoring the demands and focusing on its expansion plans. “I’ve seen companies going to Boston to get yelled at. That’s how angry shareholders are,” David Beard, lead energy analyst at research firm Coker and Palmer, said. Reacting to market sentiments, Hess and Devon said they would either buy back $1 billion worth of shares, or add that much to existing programs. Anadarko added a further $500 million to its $2.5 billion-share buyback program, while Noble Energy authorized a repurchase of $750 million. For Hess, the announcement was also a way to avoid a skirmish with activist hedge fund Elliott Management ahead of nominations for its board. Elliott, which owns more than 6 percent of Hess, had criticized the company for “continuing underperformance,” but supported the buy back program earlier this month. “We believe that repurchasing our shares represents a highly compelling return opportunity for our shareholders,” said Hess Energy Chief Executive Officer John Hess. U.S. shale producers have started believing they can drill more profitably as crude prices hold steady at around $60 a barrel. Propping up share prices also makes sense if they do want to raise more funds to invest over the next year.  As long as oil holds to current prices LCOc1CLc1, companies can afford to keep focusing on shareholder returns, analysts said. “I think we’re likely at the beginning of a theme ... there is a lot of room to improve in terms of equity,” ICON Advisers’ Rollingson said.

2018-03-14,"MESIHOVINA, Bosnia (Reuters) - Bosnia’s maiden wind farm began producing electricity on Wednesday as part of the country’s efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions and meet the renewable energy standards of the European Union it aspires to join. The 50.6 megawatt (MW) Mesihovina wind power plant, located near the northwestern town of Tomislavgrad, consists of 22 turbines and can produce 165.2 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of power a year, or enough to supply 27,500 households. The turbines are set in rocky-mountainous terrain ascending the Duvanjsko field. The project was commissioned by majority state-run power utility Elektroprivreda HZHB (EHZHB), the smallest of the three power utilities operating in the Balkan country, and took 13 years to complete. Bosnia generates 60 percent of its electricity from coal-fired power plants and the remainder from hydro-power. It plans to increase the share of renewable energy to 43 percent by 2020. “We hope that this project, which has a safe future on the energy market, will encourage new investment in renewable sources,” the utility’s General Manager Marinko Gilja said at an opening ceremony. Elektroprivreda HZHB, which itself operates seven hydro-power plants with a combined capacity of 860 MW, relies on imports to cover demand in increasingly dry weather conditions. The new capacity will boost its output by 10 percent. EHZHB’s profit dropped 90 percent last year as a long drought and soaring temperatures lowered water levels across the Western Balkans, hitting hydro-power output and driving demand and spot power prices sharply higher.  The project, built at a total cost of 82 million euros($101.4 million), was financed mainly through a loan provided by German state-owned development bank KfW while Germany’s Siemens supplied the turbines. Several developers are seeking to add around 500 MW in wind capacity in Bosnia over the coming years but only four have been issued permits so far. Due to steady winds from the Adriatic and Western Balkan mountains, energy experts expect the newly installed wind capacity in the region could reach 6.1 GW within five years.

2018-03-14,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia plans to keep its crude oil production in April below 10 million barrels per day (bpd), and maintain exports under 7 million bpd, the energy ministry said on Wednesday, as the top OPEC producer wants to end a global supply glut and boost prices. Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, has been pumping below its OPEC target since January and reducing its crude shipments, particularly to the United States, as it turns its focus on cutting exports in an attempt to drain global oil stocks. “Despite nominations coming in at 100,000 barrels a day, higher than the previous month, allocations were maintained on par with their March levels,” the ministry said in a statement. A spokesman for the energy ministry said that Saudi Arabia along with the OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers participating in a global supply cut agreement “remain committed to pursuing the common objective of restoring inventories back to their normal levels.” The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers led by Russia have agreed to maintain oil output cuts until the end of 2018 aiming to reduce global inventories and support prices. OPEC has made the five-year average its main target and managed to reduce the glut to around 74 million barrels above that benchmark, from above 300 million when the cuts began in 2017. OPEC has delivered more than 100 percent of the output cuts that members pledged under the deal, according to figures from OPEC and other analysts, helped in part by an involuntary drop in Venezuela, where output is falling amid an economic crisis. “We are happy with the excellent overall conformity levels and look forward to all participating countries maintaining or exceeding full conformity with their commitments as agreed,” the Saudi energy ministry spokesman said. But the relentless rise in U.S. production has this year put pressure on oil prices. U.S. oil is also increasingly being exported, including to the world’s biggest and fastest growing markets in Asia, eating away at OPEC and Russian market share.  Brent crude futures LCOc1 were trading at around $64.93 per barrel on Wednesday, down from above $70 in January. [O/R] U.S. crude oil production, pushed up largely by shale oil drilling, has risen by almost a quarter since mid-2016 and output soared past 10 million bpd in late 2017, overtaking production by Saudi Arabia. OPEC meets next in June to decide its output policy. Global oil producers agreed they should continue cooperating after their agreement expires at the end of this year, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Khalid al-Falih said in January.

2018-03-14,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Engine problems that have postponed deliveries of the latest generation of Airbus (AIR.PA) and Boeing (BA.N) jets are a frustration for BOC Aviation (2588.HK), the head of Asia’s second-biggest aircraft lessor said on Wednesday. The company reported better-than-expected record net profit of $587 million for the 12 months ending Dec. 31, up from $418 million a year ago, as it grew its fleet by 74 jets to 318. However, CEO Robert Martin said growth would have been higher if engine delays had not led to late deliveries. BOC Aviation is forecasting similar growth this year, with 53 deliveries arranged and the rest expected to come from sale-and-leaseback deals with airlines, he said. “There is one question mark, and I’ll be frank, and that is just to do with will Airbus and Boeing deliver our aircraft on time because of the engine issues,” Martin told Reuters in a phone interview. CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric (GE.N) and Safran SA (SAF.PA), Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (RR.L) and United Technologies Corp’s (UTX.N) Pratt & Whitney arm have all had teething issues with the latest generation of fuel-efficient engines for jets like the A320neo, A350, the Boeing 787 and the Boeing 737 MAX.  Martin said A320neo and 737 MAX jets with CFM engines were being delivered five to six weeks behind schedule, while Pratt & Whitney engined A320neos were three to four months behind schedule. Some A350s with Rolls-Royce engines that BOC had expected to receive last year were being delivered this year, he said. “What it means is for those aircraft delayed you lose the revenue from the original delivery date to when they are actually delivered,” Martin said. “That is a frustration.” All of the engine makers have said they are working to fix the problems and minimize delivery disruptions. Asian lessors are investing billions of dollars to expand in a sector that offers long-term and dollar-based revenue, underscoring the region’s importance to an industry that makes up about 40 percent of the world’s airline fleet. BOC Aviation’s net lease yield rose to 8.4 percent from 8.2 percent the prior year. The majority of the company’s aircraft are deployed with Asian airlines, with Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (0293.HK) and Indonesia’s Lion Air Group among its main customers.

Equities attempted to recover after Tuesday’s hefty losses, heartened by robust Chinese factory data, with S&P500 futures signalling a firmer opening for Wall Street. But markets struggled to overcome fears of a trade war and U.S. political uncertainty after Trump abruptly sacked Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. The Tillerson news, coming days after the exit of Gary Cohn, a strong free trade proponent, had sent the dollar skidding, pushed world stocks lower and bond prices higher. The moves accelerated after news of the planned tariffs, which reportedly target Chinese tech, electronics and telecoms. “All this is creating very uncertain times for markets,” said Peter Lowman, CIO of UK wealth manager Investment Quorum. “...The fear is the United States and China could hurt each other quite badly in a trade war.” The events pushed Wall Street 0.6-1.0 percent lower on Tuesday, filtering through to Asia, where technology shares led heavy falls. The negative momentum faded somewhat in Europe, with a pan-European equity index up 0.3 percent after it fell 1 percent on Tuesday. The index was boosted by a 1 percent jump in resources stocks which benefited from the Chinese data as well as a 3-billion-euro share buyback at German sportswear firm Adidas . That left MSCI’s all-country equity index down only marginally, its second day in the red and off one-month highs hit before news broke of Tillerson’s sacking. His departure brings to 35 the number of senior Trump administration officials who have left, Citi estimates. “The market probably correctly viewed this move as weakening internal White House opposition to some of Trump’s less market-friendly policies, in particular the President’s trade policy,” Daiwa strategist Mantas Vanagas said. The dollar has been another casualty, though it swung 0.15 percent higher after three days of losses. U.S. Treasury yields traded just off one-week lows touched earlier in the session . German 10-year government bond yields approached one-month lows and stand 20 basis points below this year’s peak, at 0.60 percent. The trade war fears at least temporarily eclipsed data from China which showed industrial output expanding at a surprisingly faster pace at the start of the year. Fixed asset investment also beat forecasts, while retail sales improved. That news helped Brent oil futures up almost half a percent after two days of declines while copper futures jumped almost one percent. Morgan Stanley analysts said the data suggested “that some tariff-related losses within its export business may be absorbed by strength elsewhere.” The data highlighted the relatively robust position of China’s and also the world’s economy. The latter is slated to grow this year by 3.9 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund’s forecast in January. But with inflation remaining subdued, markets do not see U.S. interest rates rising faster than currently priced, while European and Japanese rate rises remain a distant prospect. While a U.S. rate rise next week is already priced in, Tuesday’s data showing annual U.S. core inflation steady at 1.8 percent did not persuade markets the Federal Reserve would raise rates more than three times this year. That, along with the trade war fears, is keeping the dollar from strengthening much against a basket of currencies. It failed to make headway against the yen, against which it had briefly hit three-week highs around 107 yen. “The developments support our outlook or a weaker U.S. dollar this year,” MUFG analyst Lee Hardman said, referring to events within the Trump administration and the trade fears. Central banks in Japan and the euro zone, meanwhile, also stuck with their dovish message. The former said most of its policymakers believed it should “persistently” pursue powerful monetary easing. The euro slipped 0.2 percent against the dollar, inching off an overnight one-month high after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the ECB needed more evidence that inflation was rising towards target. He warned of risks from “possible spillovers of the new trade measures announced by the U.S. administration.” Reporting by Sujata Rao; additional reporting by Swati Pandey

2018-03-14,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iraq, OPEC’s second-largest producer of crude, is hitting a roadblock in the next phase of expanding its oil production capacity as the appetite of international energy firms for investing in the country’s low-return environment slackens. Having slashed production targets in 2013 and 2014, most international oil firms in Iraq are revising their oilfields’ plateau production levels even lower, and the discussions involved are moving slowly, Iraqi and company sources say.   Growth has been the hallmark of Iraq’s oil production in the past decade with a rise of over 2.5 million barrels per day to a peak of 4.71 million bpd in late 2016, Reuters assessments show. PRODN-IQ Iraq owes much of that growth to the likes of BP (BP.L), Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Lukoil, Eni (ENI.MI), Total (TOTF.PA) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), which oversaw the redevelopment of its oilfields after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. (Progress to Plateau Production Levels in Iraq: reut.rs/2DoUA9r) But those companies have long complained that the technical service contracts Baghdad offers are too stringent and give little return on investment. Most companies in the past five years negotiated their production plateaus lower, forcing Iraq to reduce its capacity expansion plan from 12 million bpd to 9 million bpd by 2018. Now this new target is far from attainable, and Iraq aims to raise capacity to 7 million bpd by 2022.    All companies except Petronas and Total are suggesting their plateaus be lowered, Abdul Mahdi al-Ameedi, head of the Iraqi oil ministry’s licensing and contracts office, told Reuters.  On the sidelines of a conference in Berlin last month, al-Ameedi told reporters: “In principle we accept that we reduce the plateau level for certain fields to lower production rates, but this is all under discussion.”  Total, with partner PetroChina, has committed to phase three of the expansion of the 4.1-billion-barrels Halfaya oilfield, which will double production there to 400,000 bpd in 2019.  Petronas is on track to attain production of 230,000 bpd at its Garraf oilfield.(Iraq monthly crude oil production: reut.rs/2DoaGAe) “What you’re seeing now is a second wave of renegotiations in light of the oil price and the fact that budgets are down considerably compared to five years ago,” Ian Thom, principal analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie, said.    “There are alternatives in tight oil and deepwater from many of the Iraq players that are more favourable,” Thom said.   Only Lukoil has so far reached a preliminary agreement with the oil ministry on a lower plateau target, bringing the goal for its West Qurna 2 oilfield down to 800,000 bpd from 1.2 million bpd, al-Ameedi said.  But the two sides have not yet finalised talks as discussions continue on when Lukoil can hit the new target, he said. “We are in discussions but nothing has been approved yet,” al-Ameedi said. Iraq wants the plateau to be hit earlier than Lukoil does, al-Ameedi said, but he declined to specify which timeframes were being discussed. Lukoil declined to comment.  Delays in such negotiations are a headache for any oil company that needs to plan its annual budget based on how many oilfields it wants to drill and what new facilities it needs to bring extra production on stream. The impact of negotiation delays is being felt disproportionately, with companies that have production levels farthest from the previously agreed plateau feeling the most heat, a source at one of those firms told Reuters.  Iraq’s oil capacity is near 5 million bpd and it can easily increase that by a further 10 percent in the next year or two, even without a new agreement on plateaus, analysts and industry sources say. “If you bring the few fields where there is activity under way ... and if the Kirkuk and Bai Hassan fields return ... you could see production capacity from existing investments getting close to 5.5 million bpd in the next year or two,” Thom said.  But beyond those investments at oilfields such as Rumaila, West Qurna 1, Halfaya and Zubair, “you would certainly expect a flat-lining of Iraq’s oil production with the element of natural decline kicking in”, Thom said.

2018-03-14,"OSLO, March 14 (Reuters) - Norway’s main opposition party said on Wednesday it would support the government’s plan to adopt European Union energy rules, likely securing the law’s passage and allowing the European Union outsider to remain a full member of EU markets. For the past 24 years, Norwegian companies have enjoyed market access on equal terms with companies in the EU via the European Economic Area treaty, in return for the country’s adoption of EU common market regulations. The centre-right minority government feared that rejecting the EU’s Third Energy Package, designed to enhance energy flows and improve regulatory oversight, would put Norway on a slippery slope to a Brexit-like ending of its close EU relations. Norway’s parliament is expected to vote on the package later this month. Trade unions and several centrist and left-wing parties have opposed the regulation, believing Norway could lose control of its abundant hydroelectric resources.

2018-03-14,"* Tax has been delayed on three previous occasions * Treasury says tax will help raise revenue * Sibanye-Stillwater, ArcelorMittal’s local unit oppose tax By Wendell Roelf CAPE TOWN, March 14 (Reuters) - Big energy users including Sibanye-Stillwater and ArcelorMittal’s local unit on Wednesday opposed plans by South Africa to enact long-delayed carbon tax laws in 2019, arguing the levies are unaffordable and should be scrapped or delayed. The carbon tax has already been postponed at least three times since first being mooted in 2010, after mining companies, steel firms and state-owned power utility Eskom said it would erode profits and push up electricity prices. Former finance minister Malusi Gigaba said last month that Africa’s most industrialised economy would implement the carbon tax from January next year - part of a raft of tax changes that include raising value added tax for the first time in 25 years in a bid to plug a revenue hole. The new law would affect about 1,000-1,500 companies and 75 percent of national emissions. It proposes a tax rate of 120 rand ($10) per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent and states that total tax-free allowances during the first phase until 2022 can be as high as 95 percent. “Sibanye-Stillwater’s position on the imposition and implementation of a carbon tax remains the same, that is, a total rejection of the carbon tax in any shape, form or quantum,” said the gold and platinum miner. It delivered its opinion in a written presentation to parliament at the start of public hearings on the second draft carbon tax bill released in December. Developed in line with the polluter pays principle, the proposed carbon tax bill includes staggered increases and tax breaks in the early years, allowing companies to pay six rand to 48 rand per tonne in the first phase, National Treasury said. South Africa ratified the Paris climate change pact two years ago and has pledged to cut emissions by almost half by 2030, when they are seen peaking between 398 and 614 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. Industrial firms say the proposed tax fails to take into account a lower carbon path already adopted, will create policy uncertainty and diminish South Africa’s investment allure. ArcelorMittal’s South African unit opposed the carbon tax bill on the grounds that it would hurt the steel firm’s competitiveness at a time when it was struggling with cheaper imports and weak demand. “When considering 2016 and 2017 financial figures, the estimated carbon tax payable would have affected EBITDA figures by 57 to 100 percent, which should be cause for concern,” said Siegfried Spanig, environment group manager at ArcelorMittal’s local unit in his submission at the hearings. The company said its estimated carbon tax liability would be in the region of 100 million rand a year, and wanted changes to be made, including additional tax incentives to protect struggling companies.

2018-03-14,"* Coal plants shut March-June to reduce air pollution * Closure of nuclear plants for maintenance adding to shortfall * Increased LNG imports helping meet shortfall in power capacity By Roslan Khasawneh and Jane Chung SINGAPORE/SEOUL, March 14 (Reuters) - South Korea’s move to shut coal-fired generators to control air pollution at the same time as nuclear reactors are going into scheduled maintenance is resulting in surging fuel oil imports, as utilities burn the dirty feedstock to meet power demand. South Korea’s trade ministry said in February it would suspend five coal-fired power plants, with a combined capacity of 2.32 gigawatts (GW), from March to June, part of a broad campaign to reduce pollution. That plan may backfire, at least in the short-term. A cold winter has raised power and heating demand, forcing utilities to burn more fuel oil in order to meet demand. A by-product of the crude oil refining process, fuel oil’s biggest use ahead of power generation is as a shipping fuel. “In the near-term, fuel oil imports will increase to make up for the shortfall in coal-fired generation capacity,” said Pat Markey, managing director of consultancy Sierra Vista Resources. Fuel oil imports by power producers into Asia’s fourth largest economy have jumped to 200,000 tonnes in March so far, up from 92,000 tonnes in February, tender data compiled by Reuters showed. First-quarter fuel oil imports are expected at 417,000 tonnes, up 28 percent from a year ago and already more than 60 percent of the 660,000 tonnes taken for all of last year. Burning fuel oil for power results in lower carbon dioxide emissions than coal-fired plants, but releases more toxic particles into the air. “Pollutants generated during combustion of fuel oils are nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, greenhouse gases, volatile compounds (like unburned hydrocarbons) and toxic trace metals,” according to the U.S. Commission for Environmental Cooperation. An official from a South Korean state-owned utility, said the increased fuel oil demand was partly a result of the government’s decision to halt coal-fired plants temporarily due to pollution and reduced nuclear power because of planned maintenance. The official, who declined to be identified as he is not unauthorized to speak to the media, said some 110,000 tonnes of fuel oil would be needed in April. Only two of South Korea’s major utilities, Korea East-West Power Co Ltd (EWP) and Korea Western Power Co (WP), issue tenders for fuel oil for power generation, mostly during peak summer and winter demand, data on Thomson Reuters Eikon shows. The two utilities declined to comment. Coal power generates about 40 percent of South Korea’s total electricity needs, nuclear around 30 percent, and natural gas meets 20 percent. The rest comes from oil and renewables. Even with the increase in fuel oil purchases, South Korea will have to raise imports of other fuels to meet demand as nearly half of its nuclear power plants are down for maintenance. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is the most likely to fill the gaps. Thomson Reuters Eikon data shows South Korea’s LNG shipments reached nearly 12 million tonnes between January and March 14, up 1.5 percent from the first quarter of last year.

Equity markets were attempting to recover after Tuesday’s hefty losses, heartened by robust Chinese factory data, but struggled to overcome fears of a global trade war as well as the prospect of political uncertainty in the United States. “As long as the threat of protectionism and a trade war remains, markets will remain vigilant,” Rabobank analysts told clients. The tariffs, reportedly targeting Chinese tech, electronics and telecoms, were revealed by sources hours after Trump abruptly fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Tillerson’s exit follows that of economic advisor Gary Cohn, a strong free trade proponent. Since Trump took office in 2017 as many as 35 senior officials from his administration have walked out, including Tillerson, according to Citi. “The market probably correctly viewed this move as weakening internal White House opposition to some of Trump’s less market-friendly policies, in particular the President’s trade policy,” Daiwa strategist Mantas Vanagas said. That news had sent the dollar skidding, pushed world stocks lower and bond prices higher. The moves accelerated after news broke of the planned tariffs, with Wall Street closing some 0.6-1 percent lower and hefty losses across Asia, led by technology shares  . The negative momentum faded somewhat in Europe, with a pan-European equity index up 0.24 percent after falling one percent on Tuesday. That left MSCI’s all-country equity index down 0.12 percent, its second day in the red. The dollar was flat after three days of losses while U.S. Treasury yields were trading just off one-week lows touched earlier in the session . German 10-year government bond yields approached one-month lows and currently stand 20 basis points below this year’s peak at 0.60 percent. Futures signalled a slightly firmer open for Wall Street, reversing their earlier direction. The trade war fears eclipsed strong economic data from China which showed industrial output expanding at a surprisingly faster pace at the start of the year. Fixed asset investment also beat forecasts, while retail sales improved. The data helped Brent oil futures up almost half a percent after two days of declines while copper futures jumped almost one percent. “(China’s) economy is well placed to weather any increase in U.S. tariff rates. In fact, the Chinese statistical bureau is tipping ‘relatively fast growth’ for both exports and consumption in 2018, “ said Craig James, Sydney-based chief economist at CommSec. The data highlighted the relatively robust picture of China’s and also the global economy - the latter is slated to grow this year by 3.9 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund’s forecast in January. But with inflation remaining subdued, markets do not see U.S. interest rates rising faster than currently priced in while European and Japanese rate rises remain a distant prospect. While a rate rise by the U.S. Federal Reserve next week is already priced in, Tuesday’s data which showed annual U.S. core inflation steady at 1.8 percent did not persuade markets the Fed could raise rates more than three times this year. That, along with the trade war fears, is keeping the dollar from strengthening much against a basket of currencies and failed to make any headway against the yen to which it had briefly hit three-week highs around 107 yen. Central banks in Japan and the euro zone also stuck with their dovish message to markets. The former revealed in its previous meeting’s minutes that most of its policymakers believed it should “persistently” pursue powerful monetary easing. The euro slipped 0.2 percent against the dollar, inching off an overnight one-month high after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the ECB needed more evidence that inflation was rising towards its target. Draghi warned however of risks stemming from “possible spillovers of the new trade measures announced by the U.S. administration.” Reporting by Sujata Rao; additional reporting by Swati Pandey

2018-03-14,"(Adds details, comments, 2017 earnings) MILAN, March 14 (Reuters) - Italian gas grid company Snam on Wednesday raised its investment and profit targets to 2021 after a strong 2017, helped by healthy demand in Europe and efficiency gains. Snam, which makes most of its revenue from gas transport, is keen to play a leading role in integrating Europe’s grids and making Italy a European gas hub. Europe’s biggest gas pipeline operator plans to invest 5.2 billion euros ($6.4 billion) between 2017 and 2021, up 10 percent from a previous target, and expects net profit to grow 4.5 percent on average per year, compared with a 4 percent goal disclosed previously. Chief Executive Marco Alvera said in a statement that investment would be tilted toward Italy’s grid system, “which on several occasions over the last few months has shown greater reliability compared to other European countries.” Snam, controlled by Italian state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) through a vehicle that also includes the State Grid Corporation of China, extended to 2019 its dividend policy which projects annual increases of 2.5 percent. For last year, the company proposed a dividend payment of 0.2155 euros per share. The planned investments and dividend policy will be entirely financed through cash, Alvera said. It said it would seek approval at its ordinary shareholder meeting for a share buyback plan worth up to 500 million euros. Last year Snam’s adjusted net profit rose 11.2 percent to 940 million euros, broadly in line with a Thomson Reuters SmartEstimate of 934 million euros. For this year, Snam expects net profit to rise to around 975 million euros. $1 = 0.8068 euros

2018-03-14,"MELBOURNE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - South Australians go to the polls on Saturday in a tight race  with big implications for national politics and foreign investment in a state with the most wind and solar power, but the highest electricity prices in the country. While its outcome will not dislodge Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, the vote presents a choice between renewable energy, pushed by South Australia’s centre-left Labor government, and coal, backed by Turnbull’s conservative government, which has mocked the state’s “big experiment” in wind and solar energy.  South Australia’s economy has suffered blow after blow in the last six years, with mining giant BHP Billiton scrapping a $20-billion plan to expand its Olympic Dam copper mine in 2012, the collapse of steel maker Arrium and a state-wide blackout in 2016, followed by General Motors’ closure of its Holden car plant last year. Labor, in power for 16 years, has turned to renewable energy luring foreign investors, such as Elon Musk’s Tesla, which built the world’s biggest lithium-ion battery at a windfarm run by France’s Neoen, and British billionaire Sanjeev Gupta, who wants to revive steel works using solar power. “We’re sending, really, a market signal to the world to come to South Australia,” state premier Jay Weatherill said at the launch of a poll campaign that targets 75 percent of state energy to come from renewables by 2025. South Australia already gets nearly half its electricity from renewables but has suffered blackouts when back-up power from coal and gas is unavailable. The plan is a potential bonanza for renewable energy developers as South Australia has the nation’s highest power prices, which are a big deterrent to other investors, along with supply reliability concerns.  “South Australians know that Jay Weatherill is like a problem gambler doubling down to chase his losses on energy policy,” Josh Frydenberg, the federal energy minister, said in an email to Reuters. If Labor wins an unprecedented fifth term, it will be a blow to the federal government’s plans for a national energy policy that has no renewable energy target but sets requirements for emissions cuts and reliability. South Australia’s Liberal party promises to cut power bills by cancelling Labor’s plan for a new gas-fired power plant and fund instead a new power link to a neighbouring state, to back up wind and solar power. “The federal government has proposed its own plan but it requires all the states to sign up. South Australia has refused to go along, concluding it could inhibit their plans for higher renewables,” said David Blowers, an energy policy specialist at the Grattan Institute think-thank.  “If the Liberals were to win in South Australia, you would expect the government will get the approval it needs to proceed.” Labor and Liberals are running almost neck-and-neck, with support of 30 percent and 32 percent respectively, the latest Newspoll on the South Australian election showed. Clean air is also the hottest issue in a federal by-election on Saturday in Melbourne, capital of the southeastern state of Victoria, where Labor is battling the Greens over the fate of a huge coal project.   A win for the Greens, Australia’s fourth largest political party, would complicate the legislative agenda for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, whose government holds just a one-seat majority.

Investor appetite for risk was also hit by U.S. President Donald Trump’s move to fire his Secretary of State, regarded as a moderate in his administration, reinforcing market uncertainty about Trump’s future policies. In a sign the equity market sell-off would extend elsewhere, S&P E-Mini futures were down 0.1 percent while FTSE futures slipped 0.3 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan stumbled 0.7 percent, retreating from a 1-1/2 month high on Tuesday, with the technology sector the biggest drag. Japan’s Nikkei dropped 0.8 percent. China’s SSE Composite index and the blue-chip CSI 300 fell 0.5 percent each. The MSCI Asia ex-Japan IT index declined 0.5 percent as Trump sought to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion against information technology, consumer electronics and telecoms. Large Asian technology stocks such as LG Display , Tencent Holdings and Taiwan Semiconductor were all down by more than 1 percent. “A full-on global trade war is unlikely but there may not be much peace on the trade front either,” said Sydney-based AMP Chief Economist Shane Oliver. “A U.S.-China trade war is the main risk.” Investors suspect policymakers who favour protectionism will also seek to use the currency as a trade weapon, if not overtly then through benign neglect. As news from the United States dominated, the market shrugged off stronger-than-expected data from China which showed the country’s industrial output expanded at a surprisingly faster pace at the start of the year. Fixed asset investment also handily beat forecasts, while retail sales improved from December. “The latest Chinese economic data is very encouraging,” said Craig James, Sydney-based chief economist at CommSec. “The economy is well placed to weather any increase in U.S. tariff rates. In fact, the Chinese statistical bureau is tipping ‘relatively fast growth’ for both exports and consumption in 2018.” Still, investors were inconsolable and followed overnight losses on Wall Street with the Dow off 0.7 percent, the S&P 500 down 0.6 percent and the Nasdaq Composite falling 1.0 percent. The selling intensified after Trump dismissed Tillerson following a series of public rifts over policy on North Korea, Russia and Iran. He was replaced with loyalist CIA Director Mike Pompeo. The move comes only days after the exit of White House economic advisor Gary Cohn who was a strong proponent of free trade. “Tillerson’s departure has left some worrying that it provides a green light to those in the office pushing for more protectionist measures,” analysts at ANZ Bank said in a note to clients. “Protectionism is on the rise.” Since Trump took office in 2017 as many as 35 senior officials from his administration have walked out, including Tillerson, according to Citi. Tillerson’s dismissal and the risk of new import duties on China coincided with subdued U.S. consumer price data on Tuesday with annual core inflation, at 1.8 percent, meeting expectations. The in-line reading should have been positive for risky assets as it was the fear of a pick-up in inflation and in-turn faster U.S. rate hikes that had hit global shares in early February. But the inflation data did little to move market expectations of Fed rate rises with an increase next week now fully priced-in. All that put together meant dollar weakness across a basket of currencies. It eased a tad to 106.5 yen. The yen did dip briefly after minutes of the Bank of Japan’s January meeting showed most policymakers shared the view that the central bank should “persistently” pursue powerful monetary easing. The euro rose overnight to edge towards a recent one-month top of $1.2446. It was last at $1.2405, while the pound was firmer at $1.3989.

Many of the nation’s oil fields are ageing after years of use, while high production costs are also crimping output. The country churned out 30.37 million tonnes of crude in the first two months of the year, according to data from he National Bureau of Statistics, equivalent to 3.76 million barrels per day (bpd) and on a par with the weakest level in data stretching back to June, 2011. That came as crude output from the country’s top producer, China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), dropped 1.6 percent in the first two months of 2018 compared with a year ago, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday. CNPC is aiming to produce around 100 million tonnes of crude oil, or around 2 million bpd, in 2018, the same as its target for last year, the source said. He declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media. He added that the company had reduced production at some fields and expected domestic output to decrease gradually. CNPC’s major Daqing oil field in northern China has scaled back production at costly and ageing wells. Its output dropped 7 percent in 2017. The NBS data also showed China’s oil refinery throughput rose 7 percent in the first two months of 2018 from a year earlier to 93.4 million tonnes, or 11.56 million bpd. That was the third highest on record, showing strong demand for fuel ahead of last month’s Lunar New Year festival. The bureau did not publish a monthly breakdown. Natural gas production climbed 4.9 percent in January and February from a year earlier to 26.2 billion cubic meters, the bureau said. “Output is still well short of gas needs and growth targets. China’s gas output is expected to rise to the highest level on record in 2018,” BMI Research said in a note, adding that annual output should rise by 8 percent. The nation has been pushing to switch millions of households to gas for heating, part of its drive to clean up the environment.

2018-03-14,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Wednesday it is likely to resume paying corporate tax in Australia only in 2021, after recouping billions of dollars in investments made in the country in the past decade. The oil giant was grilled at an Australian Senate hearing on tax avoidance, after having paid no tax since 2013, despite reporting billions of dollars in income from operations in the country. The hearing is part of a broader inquiry in corporate tax avoidance in resource-rich Australia. The country’s tax authorities are battling major miners BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto as well as oil and gas giants over booking income in countries like the Netherlands and Singapore, where tax rates are lower. “The only reason we’re not paying tax at the moment is because we just invested A$21 billion ($16.5 billion),” ExxonMobil Australia Chairman Richard Owen told the Senate panel. The company said it is in a tax loss position in Australia as it soaks up the cost of investing heavily in new gas production in the Bass Strait and the huge Gorgon gas project off Western Australia, both ramping up since 2017. It expects to start paying A$600 million a year in corporate tax from 2021, the company’s tax manager, Stuart Brown, said. Gorgon is unlikely to start paying petroleum resource rent tax until the mid-2030s, he said. However, over the past decade ExxonMobil Australia had an effective tax rate of more than 50 cents in every dollar, including income tax and the petroleum resource rent tax. ExxonMobil is undergoing an Australian tax audit regarding one inter-company, or related party, loan. But even if the Australian Taxation Office prevails in the dispute, it would have a “very, very small impact on our tax losses”, Brown said. The government won a landmark case against Chevron Corp last year over a contested tax bill of A$340 million  ($267 million) stemming from a related party loan at an abnormally high interest rate that lowered the oil giant’s taxable income in Australia. ExxonMobil said the facts in its loan under audit were very different from Chevron’s. Interest rates on the loan were set at around 3-5 percent, it said. The Senate probe into corporate tax avoidance, which began in 2014, is due to issue a final report by the end of May.

The move comes only days after the exit of White House economic advisor Gary Cohn who was a strong proponent of free trade, reinforcing investor uncertainty about Trump’s future policies. “Tillerson’s departure has left some worrying that it provides a green light to those in the office pushing for more protectionist measures,” analysts at ANZ Bank said in a note to clients. “Protectionism is on the rise.” Since Trump took office in 2017 as many as 35 senior officials from his administration have walked out, including Tillerson, according to Citi. Separately, Trump is looking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports, targeted at information technology, consumer electronics and telecoms, two people who had discussed the issue with the administration said. That sent the MSCI Asia ex-Japan IT index declining 0.6 percent. Large Asian technology stocks such as Samsung Electronics, LG Display, Tencent Holdings and Taiwan Semiconductor were all down by more than 1 percent. “A U.S.-China trade war is the main risk,” said Sydney-based AMP Chief Economist Shane Oliver. “A full-on global trade war is unlikely – but there may not be much peace on the trade front either.” Investors suspect policymakers who favour protectionism will also seek to use the currency as a trade weapon, if not overtly then through benign neglect. As news from the United States dominated, investors shrugged off stronger than expected data from China which showed the country’s industrial output expanded at a surprisingly faster pace at the start of the year. Fixed asset investment also handily beat forecasts, while retail sales improved from December. Tillerson’s exit and the potential for new import duties on China coincided with subdued U.S. consumer price data on Tuesday with annual core inflation, at 1.8 percent, meeting expectations. The in-line reading should have been positive for risky assets as it was the fear of a pick-up in inflation and in-turn faster U.S. rate hikes that had hit global shares in early February. “Many traders feel that equities could have ended higher if it weren’t for ‘Rexit’,” analysts at Citi said referring to Tillerson’s departure. Tuesday’s data did little to move market expectations of Fed rate rises with an increase next week now fully priced-in. All that put together meant dollar weakness across a basket of currencies. It eased 0.1 percent to 106.48 yen. The yen did dip briefly after minutes of the Bank of Japan’s January meeting showed most policymakers shared the view that the central bank should “persistently” pursue powerful monetary easing. The euro rose overnight to edge towards a recent one-month top of $1.2446. It was last at $1.2409, while the pound was firmer at $1.3991. In commodities, oil prices inched up after two straight days of losses after data showed a smaller-than-expected build in crude inventories. U.S. crude rose 10 cents to $60.81. Brent ticked up 6 cents to $64.70. Spot gold was a touch firmer at $1,328.42 an ounce. Reporting by Swati Pandey; Editing by Richard Pullin and Sam

2018-03-14,"SINGAPORE, March 14 (Reuters) - Trading in shares of Noble Group was halted on Wednesday, just days after the commodities trader said it was very close to reaching final terms with a group of senior creditors to restructure its debt. The Singapore-listed company asked for the trading halt pending the release of a statement. Embattled Noble has been negotiating a $3.4 billion debt-for-equity swap - crucial to its survival - after selling billions of dollars of assets, taking hefty writedowns and cutting hundreds of jobs over the past three years. The Hong Kong-headquartered firm, which reported a $4.9 billion loss for 2017, also said on Monday that it had opted not to pay the coupon on a $750 million bond which was due last week. Noble has a $379 million bond that matures on March 20.

2018-03-14,"* Lower than expected U.S. crude inventories offer some support * But relentless rise in U.S. output continues to weigh on market * Libya’s Zawiya oil terminal returns to normal operations By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, March 14 (Reuters) - Oil prices stabilised early on Wednesday after posting two days of falls at the start of the week. Support on Wednesday came from a report that U.S. crude inventories are not rising as much as expected during the spring season that is starting, implying healthy demand. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $60.86 a barrel at 0033 GMT, up 15 cents, or 0.25 percent, from their previous close. Brent crude futures were at $64.70 per barrel, up 6 cents, or 0.1 percent. U.S. crude inventories rose by 1.2 million barrels in the week to March 9, to 428 million barrels, the American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday. That compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 2 million barrels. Refinery crude runs rose by 85,000 barrels per day (bpd), API data showed. Despite this, general market conditions remain weak, and crude prices have not managed to return to their early 2018 highs of over $70 per barrel for Brent and almost $67 a barrel for WTI. “The ever-expanding U.S. supply continues to pose significant downside risk to oil prices,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA has risen by almost a quarter since mid-2016 and output soared past 10 million bpd in late 2017, overtaking production by top exporter Saudi Arabia. U.S. crude production, pushed up largely by shale oil drilling, is expected to rise above 11 million bpd by late 2018, taking the top spot from Russia, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Official weekly U.S. crude oil production and inventory figures are due to be published by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) later on Wednesday. Outside the United States, Libya’s Zawiya oil terminal returned to normal operations late on Tuesday after workers who were blocking ships from docking agreed to end a one-day strike, two sources said. Zawiya exports crude from Libya’s giant El Sharara oilfield, which produces 300,000 bpd, more than a quarter of the North African country’s output. Reporting by Henning Gloystein

2018-03-14,"(Adds background about Lamb) By David Morgan CANONSBURG, Pa., March 13 (Reuters) - Republicans are scrambling to avoid a political embarrassment in a conservative district of Pennsylvania, where a pro-gun, pro-union Democrat could be about to win a congressional election in one of President Donald Trump’s white, working-class strongholds. Democrat Conor Lamb, a 33-year-old Marine veteran and former federal prosecutor, is in a dead heat with Republican state Representative Rick Saccone in Tuesday’s special election for an open seat in the U.S. House of Representatives that Republicans have held since 2003. The race is seen as a referendum on Trump and a harbinger for November’s congressional elections, according to pollsters and party insiders who say the moderate Democrat could emerge as a model for Democratic candidates in other competitive House districts that Trump carried in 2016. “The Democrats have nominated the ideal candidate, because he fits the profile of the electorate. If they’d nominated a liberal who allowed the campaign to become nationalized, it would be over by now,” said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin and Marshall College Poll in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. “If he wins, or even if he just comes close, he is a model for Democrats in competitive Trump districts nationally.” Trump won the district, in southwest Pennsylvania, by nearly 20 points in 2016 and has endorsed Saccone. “The Economy is raging, at an all time high, and is set to get even better. Jobs and wages up. Vote for Rick Saccone and keep it going!” the president tweeted on Tuesday. Still, Lamb has fought to make the contest a local referendum and said he was focused on issues in his district even as he welcomed Democratic enthusiasm over the race. “This is a local race,” Lamb told reporters after voting at a church in his hometown of Mt. Lebanon shortly after sunrise on Tuesday. “I don’t think it has anything to do with the president.” Polls closed at 8 p.m. (0000 GMT). Republican dominance has been so strong in the district that Democrats ran no candidates in the previous two U.S. House elections, even though state voter registration records show Democrats outnumbering Republicans. But dynamics have changed in the district, which runs from wealthy suburbs south of Pittsburgh through hardscrabble steel and coal mining towns to farmlands along the West Virginia border. Saccone, 60, a conservative who has described himself as “Trump before Trump was Trump,” led the race by more than 10 percentage points in January. The contest has since narrowed to a toss-up on a wave of Democratic voter enthusiasm for Lamb. Republicans have also found it harder than expected to mount effective attacks on Lamb’s positions on abortion, guns and the national Democratic Party. He has eschewed the national Democratic brand, saying he would not support House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi as speaker. Lamb says he personally opposes abortion but accepts the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe vs. Wade landmark decision allowing abortion as the law of the land. He favors enforcing existing gun laws and improving the current system of background checks over setting new gun restrictions. Larry Gdovic, 61, a state government employee from Elizabeth Township, voted for Lamb. “He’s a young new guy with a lot of good fresh ideas. I don’t believe he’s a total Democrat,” Gdovic said.

The combination left investors scurrying for safety as global equities took a knock, the dollar fell and bonds rose. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.3 percent, retreating from a 1-1/2 month high hit on Tuesday. Australian shares stumbled 0.8 percent in early trade, while Japan’s Nikkei dropped 0.8 percent. South Korea’s Kospi index declined 0.7 percent. The weakness followed losses on Wall Street, with the Dow off 0.7 percent, the S&P 500 down 0.6 percent and the Nasdaq Composite down 1.0 percent. Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday after a series of public rifts over policy on North Korea, Russia and Iran, replacing his chief diplomat with hawkish CIA Director Mike Pompeo. Critics said the move would sow more instability in the volatile Trump administration and marks the departure of another moderate who sought to emphasize the United States’ strong ties to its allies. Separately, Trump is also looking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports, targeted at information technology, consumer electronics and telecoms, two people who had discussed the issue with the Trump administration said. “Tillerson’s departure has left some worrying that it provides a green light to those in the office pushing for more protectionist measures,” analysts at ANZ Bank said in a note to clients. “Protectionism is on the rise.” Investors suspect policy makers who favour protectionism will also seek to use the currency as a trade weapon, if not overtly then through benign neglect.

All that put together meant dollar weakness across a basket of currencies. It was a touch firmer at 106.63 yen but still not far from a recent 15-month trough of 105.23. The euro rose overnight to edge towards a recent one-month top of $1.2446. It was last at $1.2393. “Many traders feel that equities could have ended higher if it weren’t for ‘Rexit’,” analysts at Citi said referring to Tillerson’s departure.

But Tuesday’s data did little to change market expectations of Fed rate rises with an increase next week now fully priced-in. “While Tillerson’s exit has been rumoured for months, it speaks to persistent Trump turnover and potentially, more market-alarming, protectionist headlines,” Citi analysts added. Since Trump took office in 2017 as many as 35 senior officials from his administration have walked out, including Tillerson, according to Citi. In commodities, oil prices inched up after two straight days of losses after data showed a smaller-than-expected build in crude inventories. U.S. crude rose 18 cents to $60.89.
