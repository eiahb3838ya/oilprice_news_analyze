2018-09-14,"PANAMA CITY (Reuters) - Fewer ships from China and the United States could use the Panama Canal if trade tensions escalate between the two economic giants, but the dip could be offset by grain exports from north Brazil, the head of the organization that operates the waterway said.  The canal, which cuts through Panama creating an essential shipping route between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, is a major source of revenue for the central American country.  “Most cargoes passing through the Panama Canal come from or go to the United States and China,” Panama Canal Authority chief Jorge Quijano told Reuters late on Thursday. “Tensions between them could ultimately have an impact on the amount of loadings using the waterway in any direction.”  The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is readying a list of $200 billion in Chinese imports on which it plans to levy tariffs in coming days, stepping up the trade war between the world’s two largest economies.     However, Quijano said he expected more bulk cargo from Brazil, the world’s largest soy producer, would boost canal traffic.  Brazilian soy has traditionally been shipped across the Atlantic and Indian oceans, but farmers in top soy state Mato Grosso earlier this year signed a memorandum of understanding with the canal to look at ways to cut transport costs and increase grain volumes using the waterway via ports in the north of Brazil. New demand for U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) in countries including Japan and Mexico could also compensate for fewer vessels going to China, Quijano added, saying: “The canal has many ways to ease any impact.”  The Panama Canal has not disclosed updated figures on vessel transit by volume. In its fiscal year 2017, which ended in September 2017, it handled a record 403.8 million tonnes, including 143 million tonnes in container ships and 79 million tonnes in bulk carriers. Brazil and Argentina have already taken a greater share of the Asian grains markets, leading to lower traffic through the canal in the first few months of 2018, Quijano said. To offset that, Panama needs to convince Brazilian exporters to use the canal, Quijano said.  About 2 million tonnes of Brazilian soy went through the canal last year, out of annual soy exports of around 60 million tonnes, Brazilian data shows. For LNG exports, almost 90 percent passing through the canal comes from the United States, according to figures from the Panama Canal Authority. “If China eventually imports less LNG from the United States, we will see more imports from Japan, Korea and Mexico, which would compensate,” Quijano said.

2018-09-14,"OSLO (Reuters) - Finnish energy firm Fortum (FORTUM.HE) will pay approximately 20 million euros ($23 million) to help replenish a Nasdaq Commodities contingency fund after the default of a private Norwegian trader, the company said on Friday. Electricity derivatives trader Einar Aas earlier this week racked up losses he could not cover, leaving commodities companies who are part of the Nasdaq clearing house, and the exchange itself, to plug a 114 million euro hole. Nasdaq said on Thursday it had covered 7 million euros of the losses, and told members of its commodity clearing operation - which include Fortum - to pay the remaining 107 million within two business days or risk being declared in default themselves. The trader’s default was triggered by strong fluctuations in regional power market spreads, as heavy rain pushed down prices in the hydroelectric-dependant Nordic region, while a spike in the cost of carbon drove up German prices, Nasdaq said. Fortum said its original participation in the contingency fund was approximately 30 million euros, of which two thirds was lost when Aas’ portfolio was liquidated. “Consequently, Fortum will book approximately 20 million euros in its third quarter results as a financing cost,” it added. “Fortum expects Nasdaq to have adequate collateral and security arrangements at all times and we will monitor the situation carefully,” the company said.

2018-09-14,"BOSTON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Thousands of miles of natural gas pipelines in Massachusetts are leak-prone and need repair, utilities have told state regulators, highlighting aging energy infrastructure risks after explosions ripped through three towns outside of Boston this week. Federal investigators will examine pipeline maintenance in their probe into the Thursday night blasts in Lawrence, Andover, and North Andover, Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said on Friday. The explosions on a pipeline system belonging to Columbia Gas of Massachusetts destroyed scores of homes, killed one person and injured more than a dozen others in the largest natural gas pipeline incident in nearly a decade. The investigation could provide insight into the nation’s aging pipeline infrastructure. Roughly half of the 2.4 million miles of pipelines crisscrossing the United States were installed before 1970, said Deborah Hersman, chief executive of the non-profit National Safety Council and a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. Columbia Gas, a unit of NiSource Inc, owns and operates nearly 5,000 miles of gas pipeline across Massachusetts. But about 15 percent of that includes leak-prone pipes, the company told the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities in April, as part of its gas system enhancement plan filing. Columbia Gas and other utilities say the Massachusetts natural gas distribution system is one of the oldest in the United States, with sections built more than a century ago. The company told regulators that it repairs more than 1,200 leaks a year, on average, mostly on its main line pipes. In 2016, for example, replacing leak-prone pipes was expected to cost it about $56 million. Columbia had told customers it was conducting upgrades on parts of its system shortly before the explosions. The company was not available for comment. Columbia Gas has had a clear safety record for more than a decade in Massachusetts, though a pipeline rupture in West Virginia in 2012 triggered an explosion that destroyed three houses, according to records from the National Transportation and Safety Board and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Other Massachusetts utilities are also racing to make upgrades. Eversource Energy has disclosed that about one-third of its 3,3000 miles of distribution pipeline is leak-prone. The utility replaced about 40 miles of such pipes in 2017 and had plans for another 45 miles this year, according to disclosures with state regulators in April. Boston Gas, a unit of National Grid, replaced 107 miles of leak-prone pipes in 2016, disclosures to regulators show. But the utility has said it does not expect to have all of leak-prone pipes replaced until 2039. Democratic Senators Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren urged a Congressional investigation into the explosions to prevent any recurrence, according to a joint statement released on Friday. Investigators suspected “over-pressurization of a gas main” was a factor in the incident.

2018-09-14,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemen’s armed Houthi movement said it had launched a ballistic missile towards a Saudi Aramco oil refinery on Friday, but Saudi air defence forces said they had intercepted and destroyed the projectile. The Houthis’ al-Masirah TV said Houthi forces had targeted a refinery in Jizan, southwestern Saudi Arabia.  The Saudi state news agency quoted the spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis in Yemen as saying the missile had been heading for residential areas and had been intercepted over Jizan. “No casualties or damage were recorded when the missile was intercepted,” Colonel Turki al-Maliki said. Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Houthis say their missile attacks on the kingdom are in retaliation for air raids on Yemen by the Western-backed coalition, which entered Yemen’s war in 2015 to try to restore the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The coalition has carried out thousands of air strikes in Yemen that have hit schools, markets and hospitals, killing hundreds of people - though it says it does not target civilians.

2018-09-14,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia, the United States and Russia can between them raise global output in the next 18 months to compensate for falling oil supplies from Iran and elsewhere, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said on a visit to Moscow on Friday. U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports, which come into force in November, have already cut supply back to two-year lows, while falling Venezuelan output and unplanned outages elsewhere could push up crude prices, hurting consumers. But Perry, in an interview with Reuters, said he felt comfortable about the outlook for global crude output, and for oil prices. “I don’t foresee spikes,” Perry said, although he added there was always the potential for unforeseen events. Some analysts have expressed concerns about Saudi Arabia’s long-term ability to significantly boost output. But Perry said: “There’s a number of things going on in the kingdom that continue to give me a very positive feeling about their ability to maintain their level and even increase their level” of crude production. He cited the prospect that Kuwait and Saudi Arabia would soon resolve a border dispute, unlocking access to an oil field in a contested area. “They are working toward a solution in the not too distant future,” he said. On U.S. production, which has already been growing over the past few years, Perry said: “You look out 18 months, and I think you’ll see even a more substantial increase in the United States because of pipeline capacity being built out.” Russia, meanwhile, was “working diligently” to deliver its oil output to the world market, Perry said. Perry was in Moscow for talks with his Russian counterpart, Energy Minister Alexander Novak.  Visits by senior U.S. officials are a rarity after relations between Moscow and Washington nosedived, first over the Ukraine crisis and later over allegations of Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed sanctions on Russia, and Perry said that, while he would rather not see any more, that was a real prospect. “You avoid that by being a good citizen. You avoid that by obviously tending to this issue with Ukraine, you do this by not meddling in our elections, you do this by not engaging in activities that are considered to be uncivilized, for instance, the poisoning of the people in the UK,” Perry said. “Russia has the opportunity to send a message that they are going to be good neighbors, they are going to be civilized in the way they deal with their neighbors. That has yet to be seen, from our perspective, in dealing with Ukraine.” Russia’s conduct toward other countries would influence whether the United States was compelled to impose sanctions on the Russian-led Nord Stream 2 pipeline project. The project will expand the capacity for pumping Russian gas to northern Europe. Trump has criticized it, saying it will increase European dependence on Russian energy. Referring to an internationally-brokered roadmap for resolving a conflict in eastern Ukraine between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists, Perry said: “If Russia deals with the Minsk agreement in an appropriate way, there are some signals being sent to the rest of the European Union.”  “Until those signals get sent, the potential sanctions of Nordstream 2 are still very real ... I’ll suggest to you that the ball is in Russia’s court,” he said. In the interview, Perry issued a message for the European Union, saying it needed to wean itself off its dependence on Russian energy supplies. “If you’re a country in the European Union and you see how Ukraine has been treated by Russia, then (Russia) being the sole source or practically the sole source of gas to your country will give you a pause,” Perry told Reuters.  “And I think that’s an appropriate and rightful position to take. Have alternatives. Have competition. Have other pipelines,” he said. “So Europe by and large understand that they need multiple sources of energy and we agree with them.” Additional reporting by Dmitry Madorsky, Dmitry Zhdannikov and Timothy Gardner; Editing by Edmund Blair",https://uk.reuters.com/article/russia-usa-perry/interview-big-three-oil-states-can-offset-fall-in-iran-supplies-perry-idUKL5N1W0565,14 Sep 2018,"* ""Ball is in Russia's court"" on U.S. sanctions

2018-09-14,"BEIJING/CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela gave China another stake in the OPEC nation’s oil industry and signed several other deals in the energy sector, but Beijing made no mention of new funds for Caracas during President Nicolas Maduro’s visit to his key financier on Friday.  Maduro’s leftist government sold a 9.9 percent stake in the low-cost Sinovensa joint venture, where China National Petroleum Corporation has a 40 percent share, to China, it said in a statement.  The statement also said China and Venezuela had signed a “memorandum for cooperation in Ayacucho bloc 6,” located in Venezuela’s vast oil-rich Orinoco Belt, without elaborating.  China will drill 300 wells in Ayacucho and extend $184 million in financing for the joint oil venture Petrozumano, the statement added. A source at PDVSA, who asked to remain anonymous because he is not allowed to speak to media, said oil services and procurement at Sinovensa would be handled by Chinese companies.  It was unclear what China, which has ploughed more than $50 billion into Venezuela through oil-for-loan agreements, was giving in return. PDVSA and Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not respond to a request for information about the deal. Maduro said on Thursday he was going to China on a four-day trip with “great expectations” and promised to return with “big achievements.” Premier Li Keqiang told Maduro that Beijing was willing to provide the crisis-hit country with what help it can, according to Chinese government statements on Friday. But there was no reference in Chinese state media or in Chinese government statements to new funds for Venezuela, which is struggling with a fifth year of recession and an economy wracked by hyperinflation. Over a decade, oil-for-loan agreements helped China secure energy supplies for its fast-growing economy while bolstering an anti-U.S. ally in Latin America. The flow of cash halted nearly three years ago, however, when Venezuela asked for a change of payment terms amid falling oil prices and declining crude output that pushed its state-led economy into a hyperinflationary collapse. Venezuela’s finance ministry in July said it would receive $250 million from the China Development Bank to boost oil production but offered no details. Venezuela previously accepted a $5 billion loan from China for its struggling oil sector but has yet to receive the entire amount. In a separate meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Maduro said Venezuela was willing to “explore effective financing methods” with China and strengthen cooperation in the energy sector, Chinese state media said, citing Maduro without elaborating. Xi told Maduro China would, as before, support the Venezuelan government’s efforts to seek stability and development.

2018-09-14,"(Adds Permian rig count) By Scott DiSavino Sept 14 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies this week added oil rigs for the second time in the last three weeks even as new drilling has largely stalled since June due to pipeline constraints in the country’s biggest oilfield. Drillers added seven oil rigs in the week to Sept. 14, the biggest weekly increase in a month, bringing the total count to 867, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 749 rigs were active as energy companies have been ramping up production in anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than previous years. But the rig count has held mostly steady around 860 rigs since the start of June as crude prices in the Permian region in western Texas and eastern New Mexico have collapsed due to a lack of pipeline infrastructure needed to transport more fuel out of the region. More than half the total oil rigs are in the Permian basin in west Texas and eastern New Mexico, the nation’s biggest shale oil field. Active units there declined by one this week to 483, the least since the start of August. “The only way to get drillers in the Permian to slow their production growth is a lower oil price. And that is exactly what they have got,” said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, a Nordic corporate bank. A shale boom has helped send U.S. production surging above 10 million barrels per day (bpd) this year for the first time since the 1970s, with the United States surpassing Russia and Saudi Arabia as the top crude producer, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration this week. The EIA, however, said in its monthly forecast that U.S. crude oil production in 2019 was expected to grow at a slower rate than previously forecast. U.S. crude production is expected to rise by 840,000 bpd to 11.5 million bpd next year, lower than last month’s forecast growth of a 1.02 million-bpd to 11.7 million. U.S. crude prices were trading at about $69 per barrel, on track to increase about 2 percent this week on talk of U.S. sanctions against Iran that boosted the global benchmark Brent futures to a three-and-a-half-month high over $80 a barrel earlier this week. So far this year, U.S. oil futures have averaged $66.53 per barrel. That compares with averages of $50.85 in calendar 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading near $69 for the balance of 2018 and over $67 for calendar 2019 . In anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than 2017, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided guidance indicating an 18 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks expect to spend a total of $85.3 billion in 2018. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Since 1,055 oil and gas rigs were already in service, drillers would only have to add a handful of rigs during the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. So far this year, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,017. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-09-14,"(Reuters) - California Governor Jerry Brown on Friday pledged to launch a satellite that will track and detect the sources of climate pollutants, his state’s latest effort to challenge the Trump administration’s skepticism about the science of climate change. Brown, who was nicknamed “Governor Moonbeam” during his first stint as governor in the 1970s in part because of a proposal he made at the time to launch an emergency communications satellite for the state, said California was teaming up with earth imaging company Planet Labs to develop the technology. “We’re going to launch our own satellite. Our own damn satellite to figure out where the pollution is and how we’re going to end it,” Brown told a gathering of political, environmental and business leaders. He did not give a timeline or cost for the project.     The remarks echoed a pledge the Governor made nearly two years ago at a scientific gathering in the face of potential cuts to federal satellite and climate monitoring programs under President Donald Trump, who is skeptical of climate science. Data from the satellite would be shared with governments and others, Brown’s office said in a statement, under a new initiative called the Climate Data Partnership with Environmental Defense Fund and others.  The partnership has the potential to reduce emissions by 1,000 million metric tons a year, equivalent to taking 200 million cars off the road every year, the statement said. Initial funding for the project has been provided by philanthropists Dee and Richard Lawrence and their Overlook International Foundation as well as The Jeremy and Hannelore Grantham Environmental Trust, it said.

2018-09-14,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices pulled back on Friday on concerns additional U.S. tariffs would be placed on Chinese imports, after an earlier rally triggered by worries that more sanctions on Iran might constrict supply.  Crude futures ended the week up more than 1.6 percent. Traders said an early rally on Friday was sparked by reports U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo was going to announce  new sanctions on Iran.  “It increases the odds that there will be less oil coming out of there,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group. The gains were curbed though by reports U.S. President Donald Trump instructed aides to proceed with tariffs on about $200 billion more of Chinese products. Brent crude oil futures pulled back on the reports of additional tariffs, dropping 9 cents a barrel to settle at $78.09. The global benchmark fell 2.0 percent on Thursday after rising on Wednesday to its highest since May 22 at $80.13.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures settled up 40 cents at $68.99 a barrel after dropping 2.5 percent on Thursday. After a volatile week, Brent was set for a 1.6 percent weekly rise and WTI 1.8 percent. Brent reached a session high of $78.94 a barrel, as speculators attempted to push the price above the $79.00 level.  Brent crude futures have reached a high around $80.00 a barrel three times this year before pulling back.  “The price action of yesterday confirms $80.00 a barrel as a strong resistance line in Brent,” consultancy Petromatrix said in a research note. “There has been a lot of speculative interest searching for Brent above $80.00 a barrel on the back of the U.S. sanctions on buyers of Iranian crude oil, but so far this year any buying of Brent above $79.00 barrel did not have a long shelf life.”  U.S. energy companies this week added oil rigs for a second week in a row with crude prices trading near their highest since the summer of 2015 as major oil producing countries extended a global deal to limit supply. Drillers added two oil rigs in the week to Dec. 1, bringing the total count up to 749, the highest since September, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. The United States is renewing sanctions on Iran after withdrawing from a nuclear deal forged in 2015 between Tehran and world powers.  Washington re-imposed some of the financial sanctions from Aug. 6, while those affecting Iran’s petroleum sector will come into force from Nov. 4. Refiners in India, traditionally major buyers of Iranian crude, will cut their monthly loadings from Iran for September and October by nearly half from earlier this year. But Iran’s OPEC Governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, said in comments to Reuters that a “supply shortage” meant the United States would not be able to meet its zero export target.

2018-09-14,"ANDOVER, Mass. (Reuters) - Some 8,000 people in Boston’s suburbs had little hope of returning home soon as investigators scrambled on Friday to find out the cause of dozens of gas explosions that destroyed scores of homes in the biggest such accident in nearly a decade. The blasts on Thursday killed one person and left more than a dozen injured in Andover, North Andover and Lawrence - North of Boston - and stranded more than 18,000 homes and businesses without power, according to emergency officials.  Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker declared a state of emergency for the area while expressing frustration with the utility company whose gas pipeline exploded.  “On a number of very significant issues, we heard one thing, then something else happened. We heard one thing, then something else happened,” Baker said at a press conference, referring to Columbia Gas, a unit of NiSource Inc (NI.N). As a result, Baker put rival utility Eversource Energy (ES.N) in charge of the response to the explosion, replacing Columbia Gas. “The follow through just was not there,” Baker said. Columbia Gas President Steve Bryant, speaking at a televised news conference on Friday, said, “We advanced this as rapidly as it could possibly be advanced.” He mentioned difficulties such as getting into people’s homes. “We are sorry,” he said. “This is the sort of thing a gas distribution company hopes to never have.” Eversource did not return messages seeking comment.  Massachusetts State Police said around 70 fires, explosions or investigations of gas odour had been reported on Thursday, though by Friday afternoon officials said that all had been extinguished. It was unclear how many of the fires and explosions were in homes or other locations. It was the largest natural gas pipeline accident, in terms of the number of buildings involved, in the United States since 2010, when an interstate natural gas transmission line operated by Pacific Gas and Electric Company ruptured in San Bruno, California, destroying 38 buildings, damaging 70 more, and killing eight people, according to a Reuters analysis of incident reports from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Investigators suspected that over-pressurisation of a gas main belonging to Columbia Gas of Massachusetts led to the series of explosions and fires, Andover Fire Chief Michael Mansfield said on Thursday. Frank Lupa, a 79-year-old retiree in Lawrence, spent the night in a middle school along with other dislodged residents, and said he prayed as chaos descended on his neighbourhood. Lupa is unlikely to return home soon. Those driven from their homes “should expect that the restoration process will take several days or longer,” Andrew Maylor, the town manager of North Andover, said on Twitter. The Massachusetts natural gas distribution system is one of the oldest in the United States, with the age of some of the piping more than a century old, according to utility company disclosures with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities. Still, Lawrence Mayor Dan Rivera said that “The least informed, and the last to act, has been Columbia Gas.”  NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said it would likely take investigators some time to examine the pipeline’s design, maintenance and upgrades. “The truth of the matter is we really don’t have any factual information at this point to confirm,” Sumwalt said on Friday. Columbia Gas is investigating, NISource spokesman Ken Stammen said on Thursday. Before the explosions, Columbia Gas had said it would be upgrading gas lines in neighbourhoods across the state, including the affected suburbs. NiSource shares fell 12 percent on Friday. “Our thoughts and continued support are with those who have been injured and affected. We are focussed on providing as much support as possible to our customers, residents and communities,” the utility said in a statement.  Fire and utility crews were still going door-to-door on Friday to conduct safety checks and shut off gas meters, officials said, after firefighters raced for hours from one blaze to another and utility crews rushed to shut off gas and electricity on Thursday. Eighteen-year-old Leonel Rondon died when his car was crushed by a falling chimney, a spokeswoman for the Essex County District Attorney’s office said. Lawrence General Hospital said it had treated 13 people for injuries ranging from smoke inhalation to blast trauma. Rivera urged residents to stay away from their homes.  “There could be still a gas leak in your home,” Rivera said. “You can’t see it and in some cases you won’t be able to smell it, and God forbid you go to sleep and don’t wake up.” The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration said it was sending a team to support the state’s emergency response efforts. “At this time, the focus remains on ensuring the public safety,” Baker said. “Once that’s complete, we will work with federal government and others to investigate how this occurred and hold the appropriate parties accountable for their actions.” In the past 20 years, about 100 people have died and 400 more have been hurt in major natural gas pipeline accidents investigated by the NTSB. Those accidents have caused more than $100 million in damage.

2018-09-14,"TORONTO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N) has hired investment bank TD Securities (TD.TO) to facilitate a potential sale of its Canadian business, which could fetch as much as C$2.4 billion ($1.8 billion), people familiar with the situation told Reuters this week. Should the move succeed, it would mark the exit of the U.S. pipeline giant from Canada, having closed its sale of the Trans Mountain pipeline to the Canadian government for about C$4.5 billion at the end of last month.  After the Reuters report on the hiring of the bank, shares in Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd (KML.TO), which completed its initial public offering just last year, turned positive and jumped 3.7 percent to a three-month high. They ended up 2.1 percent in a flat market. Shares in Houston-based Kinder Morgan closed down 1.3 percent. Spokeswomen for TD and Kinder Morgan declined to comment on the hiring of the investment bank and the valuation. Sources declined to be identified as the process is private. Pipeline companies in Canada have faced opposition from environmental groups and First Nations groups in recent times  in getting approval for new projects. Last month, a Canadian court overturned approval of the Trans Mountain expansion, saying that Ottawa failed to adequately consider aboriginal concerns. On the flip side though, this makes established pipelines highly prized assets by those operating in the country.  At a conference earlier this month in New York, Kinder Morgan Chief Executive Steven Kean indicated his willingness to sell the rest of the Canadian business, noting that the original purpose of these assets was to support the Trans Mountain project. Kinder Morgan bought Terasen Inc in 2005, a deal in which it acquired the Trans Mountain pipeline and dramatically broadened its footprint in Canada. Kinder Morgan’s remaining Canadian business includes the Edmonton, Alberta and Vancouver Wharves terminal businesses, as well as the Canadian portion of the Cochin pipeline. The unit has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of about C$200 million, Kean said at the time. The assets, which could be sold separately or in one swoop, are expected to go for a multiple of 10 to 12 times EBITDA, the sources said, taking the total deal value to C$2.4 billion. The bidding for the business is expected to come from midstream companies, private equity firms and infrastructure funds, the sources added. Kinder Morgan would likely keep the assets if it does not get a good price as they generate solid cash flows, the sources added. In a note following the Reuters report, RBC analyst Robert Kwan said “we would view a sale process as positive for Kinder Morgan Canada’s share price.” In 2016, Williams Cos Inc (WMB.N), another U.S. pipeline company, sold its Canadian business. Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO) said in July it would sell its Canadian natural gas gathering and processing business to Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP (BIP.N) and its institutional partners for about C$4.31 billion. In February, Canadian oil sands producer MEG Energy (MEG.TO) agreed to sell some pipeline and storage assets in Alberta to Wolf Midstream Inc for C$1.61 billion.

2018-09-14,"(Adds comments from minister’s spokesman, analyst) By Rod Nickel WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Sept 14 (Reuters) - China’s Sinopec Corp has joined a group planning to build an oil refinery in Alberta, an enterprise that would strengthen demand for the Canadian province’s heavily discounted crude. State-owned Sinopec, formally known as China Petroleum & Chemical Corp, along with an Alberta indigenous group, China State Construction Engineering Corp and Alberta management company Teedrum, plan to build a refinery to process 167,000 barrels per day of crude into gasoline and other products, the project’s consulting firm Stantec Inc said in a statement on Thursday. The SinoCan Global refinery would cost C$8.5 billion, with a financing plan still to be worked out, said Teedrum President Ken Horn, who is leading the effort. Ownership has not been determined. The group hopes to receive regulatory approval from the Alberta and Canadian governments within two years, he said in an interview on Friday. Most of the refined products will be exported. “It helps create value for the bitumen,” Horn said, referring to the tarry, semi-solid form of Alberta’s heavy crude. “Right now we ship most of that (crude) out of the province. We should do a lot more to maximize the value of that asset.” Most of Canada’s crude is produced in landlocked Alberta, where pipeline capacity has not expanded as rapidly as production. Resulting bottlenecks have hindered transportation to U.S. refineries, steepening an already deep price discount for the province’s crude, which grew to a multi-year high this week. Sinopec’s interest is encouraging news for a Canadian sector that has seen foreign oil majors retreat over concerns about high production costs and the oil sands’ environmental toll. China’s involvement would complement its existing Alberta investments, Horn said. State-owned CNOOC Ltd bought energy producer Nexen in 2013. If Sinopec plans to ship refined products from Canada to China, it would likely move them by rail to the Pacific Coast, since pipeline space is limited, said GMP FirstEnergy analyst Michael Dunn. It may make more sense for China to import Canadian crude and refine it domestically, he said. Alberta’s previous government declined to support the aboriginal-led refinery proposal in 2012, after deciding the project did not make economic sense. This time, the project involves China and is not soliciting government help, Horn said. A spokesman for Alberta Energy Minister Margaret McCuaig-Boyd said on Friday that building a refinery is “ambitious”, and positive for the economy if the project can competitively move refined products offshore. Sinopec could not be reached.

2018-09-14,"PANAMA CITY (Reuters) - Fewer ships from China and the United States could use the Panama Canal if trade tensions escalate between the two economic giants, but the dip could be offset by grain exports from north Brazil, the head of the organization that operates the waterway said.  The canal, which cuts through Panama creating an essential shipping route between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, is a major source of revenue for the central American country.  “Most cargoes passing through the Panama Canal come from or go to the United States and China,” Panama Canal Authority chief Jorge Quijano told Reuters late on Thursday. “Tensions between them could ultimately have an impact on the amount of loadings using the waterway in any direction.”  The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is readying a list of $200 billion in Chinese imports on which it plans to levy tariffs in coming days, stepping up the trade war between the world’s two largest economies.     However, Quijano said he expected more bulk cargo from Brazil, the world’s largest soy producer, would boost canal traffic.  Brazilian soy has traditionally been shipped across the Atlantic and Indian oceans, but farmers in top soy state Mato Grosso earlier this year signed a memorandum of understanding with the canal to look at ways to cut transport costs and increase grain volumes using the waterway via ports in the north of Brazil. New demand for U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) in countries including Japan and Mexico could also compensate for fewer vessels going to China, Quijano added, saying: “The canal has many ways to ease any impact.”  The Panama Canal has not disclosed updated figures on vessel transit by volume. In its fiscal year 2017, which ended in September 2017, it handled a record 403.8 million tonnes, including 143 million tonnes in container ships and 79 million tonnes in bulk carriers. Brazil and Argentina have already taken a greater share of the Asian grains markets, leading to lower traffic through the canal in the first few months of 2018, Quijano said. To offset that, Panama needs to convince Brazilian exporters to use the canal, Quijano said.  About 2 million tonnes of Brazilian soy went through the canal last year, out of annual soy exports of around 60 million tonnes, Brazilian data shows. For LNG exports, almost 90 percent passing through the canal comes from the United States, according to figures from the Panama Canal Authority. “If China eventually imports less LNG from the United States, we will see more imports from Japan, Korea and Mexico, which would compensate,” Quijano said.

2018-09-14,"OSLO (Reuters) - Finnish energy firm Fortum (FORTUM.HE) will pay approximately 20 million euros ($23 million) to help replenish a Nasdaq Commodities contingency fund after the default of a private Norwegian trader, the company said on Friday. Electricity derivatives trader Einar Aas earlier this week racked up losses he could not cover, leaving commodities companies who are part of the Nasdaq clearing house, and the exchange itself, to plug a 114 million euro hole. Nasdaq said on Thursday it had covered 7 million euros of the losses, and told members of its commodity clearing operation - which include Fortum - to pay the remaining 107 million within two business days or risk being declared in default themselves. The trader’s default was triggered by strong fluctuations in regional power market spreads, as heavy rain pushed down prices in the hydroelectric-dependant Nordic region, while a spike in the cost of carbon drove up German prices, Nasdaq said. Fortum said its original participation in the contingency fund was approximately 30 million euros, of which two thirds was lost when Aas’ portfolio was liquidated. “Consequently, Fortum will book approximately 20 million euros in its third quarter results as a financing cost,” it added. “Fortum expects Nasdaq to have adequate collateral and security arrangements at all times and we will monitor the situation carefully,” the company said.

2018-09-14,"BOSTON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Thousands of miles of natural gas pipelines in Massachusetts are leak-prone and need repair, utilities have told state regulators, highlighting aging energy infrastructure risks after explosions ripped through three towns outside of Boston this week. Federal investigators will examine pipeline maintenance in their probe into the Thursday night blasts in Lawrence, Andover, and North Andover, Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said on Friday. The explosions on a pipeline system belonging to Columbia Gas of Massachusetts destroyed scores of homes, killed one person and injured more than a dozen others in the largest natural gas pipeline incident in nearly a decade. The investigation could provide insight into the nation’s aging pipeline infrastructure. Roughly half of the 2.4 million miles of pipelines crisscrossing the United States were installed before 1970, said Deborah Hersman, chief executive of the non-profit National Safety Council and a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. Columbia Gas, a unit of NiSource Inc, owns and operates nearly 5,000 miles of gas pipeline across Massachusetts. But about 15 percent of that includes leak-prone pipes, the company told the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities in April, as part of its gas system enhancement plan filing. Columbia Gas and other utilities say the Massachusetts natural gas distribution system is one of the oldest in the United States, with sections built more than a century ago. The company told regulators that it repairs more than 1,200 leaks a year, on average, mostly on its main line pipes. In 2016, for example, replacing leak-prone pipes was expected to cost it about $56 million. Columbia had told customers it was conducting upgrades on parts of its system shortly before the explosions. The company was not available for comment. Columbia Gas has had a clear safety record for more than a decade in Massachusetts, though a pipeline rupture in West Virginia in 2012 triggered an explosion that destroyed three houses, according to records from the National Transportation and Safety Board and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Other Massachusetts utilities are also racing to make upgrades. Eversource Energy has disclosed that about one-third of its 3,3000 miles of distribution pipeline is leak-prone. The utility replaced about 40 miles of such pipes in 2017 and had plans for another 45 miles this year, according to disclosures with state regulators in April. Boston Gas, a unit of National Grid, replaced 107 miles of leak-prone pipes in 2016, disclosures to regulators show. But the utility has said it does not expect to have all of leak-prone pipes replaced until 2039. Democratic Senators Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren urged a Congressional investigation into the explosions to prevent any recurrence, according to a joint statement released on Friday. Investigators suspected “over-pressurization of a gas main” was a factor in the incident.

2018-09-14,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia, the United States and Russia can between them raise global output in the next 18 months to compensate for falling oil supplies from Iran and elsewhere, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said on a visit to Moscow on Friday. U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports, which come into force in November, have already cut supply back to two-year lows, while falling Venezuelan output and unplanned outages elsewhere could push up crude prices, hurting consumers. But Perry, in an interview with Reuters, said he felt comfortable about the outlook for global crude output, and for oil prices. “I don’t foresee spikes,” Perry said, although he added there was always the potential for unforeseen events. Some analysts have expressed concerns about Saudi Arabia’s long-term ability to significantly boost output. But Perry said: “There’s a number of things going on in the kingdom that continue to give me a very positive feeling about their ability to maintain their level and even increase their level” of crude production. He cited the prospect that Kuwait and Saudi Arabia would soon resolve a border dispute, unlocking access to an oil field in a contested area. “They are working toward a solution in the not too distant future,” he said. On U.S. production, which has already been growing over the past few years, Perry said: “You look out 18 months, and I think you’ll see even a more substantial increase in the United States because of pipeline capacity being built out.” Russia, meanwhile, was “working diligently” to deliver its oil output to the world market, Perry said. Perry was in Moscow for talks with his Russian counterpart, Energy Minister Alexander Novak.  Visits by senior U.S. officials are a rarity after relations between Moscow and Washington nosedived, first over the Ukraine crisis and later over allegations of Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed sanctions on Russia, and Perry said that, while he would rather not see any more, that was a real prospect. “You avoid that by being a good citizen. You avoid that by obviously tending to this issue with Ukraine, you do this by not meddling in our elections, you do this by not engaging in activities that are considered to be uncivilized, for instance, the poisoning of the people in the UK,” Perry said. “Russia has the opportunity to send a message that they are going to be good neighbors, they are going to be civilized in the way they deal with their neighbors. That has yet to be seen, from our perspective, in dealing with Ukraine.” Russia’s conduct toward other countries would influence whether the United States was compelled to impose sanctions on the Russian-led Nord Stream 2 pipeline project. The project will expand the capacity for pumping Russian gas to northern Europe. Trump has criticized it, saying it will increase European dependence on Russian energy. Referring to an internationally-brokered roadmap for resolving a conflict in eastern Ukraine between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists, Perry said: “If Russia deals with the Minsk agreement in an appropriate way, there are some signals being sent to the rest of the European Union.”  “Until those signals get sent, the potential sanctions of Nordstream 2 are still very real ... I’ll suggest to you that the ball is in Russia’s court,” he said. In the interview, Perry issued a message for the European Union, saying it needed to wean itself off its dependence on Russian energy supplies. “If you’re a country in the European Union and you see how Ukraine has been treated by Russia, then (Russia) being the sole source or practically the sole source of gas to your country will give you a pause,” Perry told Reuters.  “And I think that’s an appropriate and rightful position to take. Have alternatives. Have competition. Have other pipelines,” he said. “So Europe by and large understand that they need multiple sources of energy and we agree with them.” Additional reporting by Dmitry Madorsky, Dmitry Zhdannikov and Timothy Gardner; Editing by Edmund Blair",https://uk.reuters.com/article/russia-usa-perry/interview-big-three-oil-states-can-offset-fall-in-iran-supplies-perry-idUKL5N1W0565,14 Sep 2018,"* ""Ball is in Russia's court"" on U.S. sanctions

2018-09-14,"BEIJING/CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela gave China another stake in the OPEC nation’s oil industry and signed several other deals in the energy sector, but Beijing made no mention of new funds for Caracas during President Nicolas Maduro’s visit to his key financier on Friday.  Maduro’s leftist government sold a 9.9 percent stake in the low-cost Sinovensa joint venture, where China National Petroleum Corporation has a 40 percent share, to China, it said in a statement.  The statement also said China and Venezuela had signed a “memorandum for cooperation in Ayacucho bloc 6,” located in Venezuela’s vast oil-rich Orinoco Belt, without elaborating.  China will drill 300 wells in Ayacucho and extend $184 million in financing for the joint oil venture Petrozumano, the statement added. A source at PDVSA, who asked to remain anonymous because he is not allowed to speak to media, said oil services and procurement at Sinovensa would be handled by Chinese companies.  It was unclear what China, which has ploughed more than $50 billion into Venezuela through oil-for-loan agreements, was giving in return. PDVSA and Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not respond to a request for information about the deal. Maduro said on Thursday he was going to China on a four-day trip with “great expectations” and promised to return with “big achievements.” Premier Li Keqiang told Maduro that Beijing was willing to provide the crisis-hit country with what help it can, according to Chinese government statements on Friday. But there was no reference in Chinese state media or in Chinese government statements to new funds for Venezuela, which is struggling with a fifth year of recession and an economy wracked by hyperinflation. Over a decade, oil-for-loan agreements helped China secure energy supplies for its fast-growing economy while bolstering an anti-U.S. ally in Latin America. The flow of cash halted nearly three years ago, however, when Venezuela asked for a change of payment terms amid falling oil prices and declining crude output that pushed its state-led economy into a hyperinflationary collapse. Venezuela’s finance ministry in July said it would receive $250 million from the China Development Bank to boost oil production but offered no details. Venezuela previously accepted a $5 billion loan from China for its struggling oil sector but has yet to receive the entire amount.

2018-09-14,"MOSCOW, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia, the United States and Russia can between them raise global output in the next 18 months to compensate for falling oil supplies from Iran and elsewhere, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said on a visit to Moscow on Friday. Speaking in an interview with Reuters, Perry said he had a positive feeling about Saudi Arabia’s ability to maintain and even increase its level of production. He said there were a number of reasons for that, among them the prospect that Kuwait and Saudi Arabia would soon resolve a border dispute, unlocking access to an oil field in the contested area. Perry said that in the United States he expected a more substantial increase in crude output over the next 18 months than the increases seen so far, as new pipeline capacity is brought on stream. Russia, meanwhile, was “working diligently” to deliver output to the world market, Perry said. “So I don’t foresee spikes” in world oil prices, he said in the interview. Some analysts have expressed concerns about Saudi Arabia’s long term ability to significantly boost output. On Washington’s fraught political relationship with Russia, Perry said both he and his Russian counterpart, Energy Minister Alexander Novak, would rather not seen an expansion of U.S. sanctions. But he said the ball was in Russia’s court. “Russia has the opportunity to send a message that they are going to be good neighbours, they are going to be civilised in the way they deal with their neighbours. That has yet to be seen, from our perspective, in dealing with Ukraine.” Russia’s conduct towards other countries would influence whether the United States was compelled to impose sanctions on the Russian-led Nord Stream 2 pipeline project. “Until those signals get sent, the potential sanctions of Nord Stream 2 are still very real,” he said.

2018-09-14,"(Adds Permian rig count) By Scott DiSavino Sept 14 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies this week added oil rigs for the second time in the last three weeks even as new drilling has largely stalled since June due to pipeline constraints in the country’s biggest oilfield. Drillers added seven oil rigs in the week to Sept. 14, the biggest weekly increase in a month, bringing the total count to 867, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 749 rigs were active as energy companies have been ramping up production in anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than previous years. But the rig count has held mostly steady around 860 rigs since the start of June as crude prices in the Permian region in western Texas and eastern New Mexico have collapsed due to a lack of pipeline infrastructure needed to transport more fuel out of the region. More than half the total oil rigs are in the Permian basin in west Texas and eastern New Mexico, the nation’s biggest shale oil field. Active units there declined by one this week to 483, the least since the start of August. “The only way to get drillers in the Permian to slow their production growth is a lower oil price. And that is exactly what they have got,” said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, a Nordic corporate bank. A shale boom has helped send U.S. production surging above 10 million barrels per day (bpd) this year for the first time since the 1970s, with the United States surpassing Russia and Saudi Arabia as the top crude producer, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration this week. The EIA, however, said in its monthly forecast that U.S. crude oil production in 2019 was expected to grow at a slower rate than previously forecast. U.S. crude production is expected to rise by 840,000 bpd to 11.5 million bpd next year, lower than last month’s forecast growth of a 1.02 million-bpd to 11.7 million. U.S. crude prices were trading at about $69 per barrel, on track to increase about 2 percent this week on talk of U.S. sanctions against Iran that boosted the global benchmark Brent futures to a three-and-a-half-month high over $80 a barrel earlier this week. So far this year, U.S. oil futures have averaged $66.53 per barrel. That compares with averages of $50.85 in calendar 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading near $69 for the balance of 2018 and over $67 for calendar 2019 . In anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than 2017, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided guidance indicating an 18 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks expect to spend a total of $85.3 billion in 2018. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Since 1,055 oil and gas rigs were already in service, drillers would only have to add a handful of rigs during the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. So far this year, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,017. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-09-14,"* Report says Trump proceeding with tariffs on China * Emerging market stocks rise after Turkey rate hike * Oil rises, helping energy shares (Updates with forthcoming U.S. tariffs on China) By Trevor Hunnicutt NEW YORK, Sept 14 (Reuters) - A world stock index climbed as bank and energy shares rose on Friday, but the momentum was sapped by a report that Washington may fire a new salvo in its trade dispute with Beijing. U.S. President Donald Trump has directed aides to place U.S. tariffs on about $200 billion of Chinese goods, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg News first reported Trump’s action. That news deflated the confidence of investors, who earlier pushed the MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, to its highest level since Sept. 4. The index last rose 0.12 percent on the day. On Wall Street, financial shares were helped by higher rates, which are seen to benefit banks, which can charge higher interest. Energy stocks got a boost from rising oil prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 74.57 points, or 0.29 percent, to 26,071.42, the S&P 500 lost 7.54 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,896.64 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 29.94 points, or 0.37 percent, to 7,983.77. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes briefly hit the psychologically significant 3 percent level for the first time in more than a month as prices on U.S. government bonds fell on economic data that seems solid enough to support plans by the Federal Reserve to raise rates another two times in 2018. U.S. crude rose 0.82 percent to $69.15 per barrel and Brent was last at $78.34, up 0.2 percent on the day. The United States is renewing sanctions on Iran, a major oil producer, after withdrawing from a nuclear deal forged in 2015 between Tehran and world powers. The dollar index rose 0.41 percent. The greenback has been a safe haven from setbacks on the trade issue. Copper, used heavily by China, lost 1.82 percent to $5,923.50 a tonne. The Chinese yuan traded offshore slipped to 6.88 per dollar from a high of 6.84 earlier in the session. Chinese shares earlier had retreated as data showed real estate investment in the country fell in August, raising concern that a cooling property market could increase risks for Beijing’s economic outlook as the trade environment worsens. “While the potential for a trade deal in the near-term remains low, a resumption of dialogue could lift sentiment and support markets,” analysts at Credit Suisse wrote in a note to clients. A sharp interest rate increase by Turkey’s central bank to support a tumbling lira boosted emerging markets. The bank hiked its benchmark interest rate by more than one-third, to 24 percent. Currency crises in both Turkey and Argentina have stoked fears of contagion over the past several weeks, hammering emerging market assets from Indonesia and India to South Africa. Turkish lira implied volatility gauges fell to their lowest in more than a month, as sentiment continued to improve. “The bold decision (by Turkey’s central bank) reduces the risk that a full-scale financial crisis may unfold,” analysts at Rabobank wrote in a note to clients. “The central bank’s efforts must be accompanied by an implementation of constructive macro prudential policies by the administration.” Emerging market stocks tracked by MSCI rose 0.85 percent.

2018-09-14,"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When the chairman of Indian conglomerate Mahindra announced on stage at a climate summit in San Francisco that his $20 billion multinational would slash its greenhouse gas emissions to zero, it came as a surprise - even to the company’s chief sustainability officer. Anirban Ghosh said it had been agreed that only the group’s largest company would strive to become carbon neutral, producing no more emissions than it could offset elsewhere. But plans appeared to change in the heat of the moment, said Ghosh, with the chairman promising that all of Mahindra’s nearly 100 companies would be carbon neutral by 2040. “Now, this is not something we prepared for,” the sustainability officer said after the announcement at the Global Climate Action Summit. At a summit - which aims to give momentum to the fight by cities, regions and businesses against climate change - there is an increasing buzz about efforts to fully eliminate - or offset - emissions. “There’s something great about ... the power of zero in focusing minds,” said Jonathan Shopley, managing director at Natural Capital Partners, a London-based company that provides carbon consulting and carbon offsetting services to clients. “It’s a concept that everybody gets,” he said at a panel on the sidelines of the summit. Around the world, companies and cities are increasingly setting net-zero carbon goals for themselves as freak weather attributed to climate change spurs them to cut their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, experts said. “This is the new frontier,” said Johanna Partin, director of the San Francisco-based Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance, which requires its members to adopt carbon-neutrality targets. At the summit, attended by 4,500 delegates from city and regional governments worldwide as well as industries, promises to achieve net-zero emissions have been a major focus. In late August, in the lead-up to the summit, mayors from 19 of the world’s biggest cities, including London and Tokyo, vowed to make all their buildings carbon neutral by 2050. Also, days before the three-day summit, organized by California's Governor Jerry Brown, the governor issued an executive order calling for his West Coast state to achieving carbon neutrality by 2045. here About 80 cities worldwide - from Copenhagen to Melbourne - have so far adopted a carbon neutral goal, said Partin, though the definition the network uses includes cities committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 80 to 100 percent by 2050. More companies also are setting goals to become carbon neutral, said Bob Perciasepe, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a U.S. think-tank. Many aim to do so both by offseting their emissions by purchasing carbon credits from others who are cutting emissions, he said. But many also are turning to clean sources of energy. Among the large corporations that have pledged in recent years to become carbon neutral are software giant Microsoft and U.S. ride-hailing service Lyft.

2018-09-14,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German energy group Uniper has mandated investment bank Rothschild to explore a sale of its French assets, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said, under pressure from a planned exit from coal-fired power. Uniper, in which Finland’s Fortum owns a 47 percent stake, last month said it would have to review its business in France if the coal shutdown goes ahead.  A spokesman for Uniper said the French assets were subject to a strategic review, declining to be more specific. Rothschild was not immediately available for comment. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung earlier reported that Uniper had mandated Rothschild to explore the French sale. Uniper owns about 2,100 megawatts (MW) of installed capacity in France, of which 1,200 MW are coal. Along with French state-controlled utility EDF, it is the only operator of coal-fired power plants in the country. The assets are unlikely to fetch a high price, the source said, adding that sellers of coal plants, including Engie which is mulling a sale of its German sites, were in a tough spot as due to growing political aversion to the fuel. French President Emmanuel Macron in November said the country would phase out all coal-fired stations by 2021 and Germany has formed a commission to come up with a roadmap for a phase-out of the technology.

Spot prices for November LNG-AS delivery in Asia were heard around $12.00 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) this week, down 5 cents from the week before, market sources said. The first half of November was weaker than the second, with one cargo for delivery in the first two weeks of the month offered but unsold at $12.00, traders said. The last of the October cargoes also weakened during the week, slipping to around $11.40 from $11.55. LNG prices had risen in recent weeks to multi-year seasonal highs and above peaks reached in the previous four winters, usually the most expensive period of the super-cool gas. Aside from demand from Japanese and South Korean customers seeking to replenish their gas stocks before winter, prices of contracts were pulled up by rising crude oil, against which some deals are priced. Brent crude futures hit $80 a barrel briefly this week, the highest since May. Brent prices have not been consistently at the $80 mark since 2014. In Bangladesh, one of the world’s latest LNG importers, supplies to its new floating LNG terminal are set to start on a regular basis following months of technical difficulties after a cargo from Qatar loaded last Sunday. An official form the state-owned Petrobangla said cargos now should be arriving at a rate of around three a month, or every 10 days. Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Company (NLNG) was selling a cargo for Sept. 26-28 FOB loading, with the tender closing on Sept. 13 Exxon Mobil’s Papua New Guinea LNG plant was also tendering a cargo, traders said. India’s state-run GAIL (India) was in the market to sell a cargo from Cove Point, one trader said, adding it was the third time the utility was trying to sell LNG from the U.S. terminal with which it has a long-term tolling agreement. Partners in Inpex Corp’s Ichthys project in Australia bought a second commissioning cargo, another trader said. Despite low activity this week from Asian buyers, utilities are expected to be restocking sites after a hot summer which prompted more gas usage and delayed stocking up. South Korea’s KOGAS, the world’s second corporate largest LNG buyer and only wholesaler in the country, bought 2.3 million tonnes of LNG last month — an increase of 18.8 percent from a year ago.

2018-09-14,"SAO PAULO, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Brazil’s largest independent investment bank Banco BTG Pactual SA may keep its stake in Petrobras Oil and Gas BV (Petrobras Africa) to avoid having to book a loss in a potential sale, one source with knowledge of the matter said on Friday. In June, Reuters reported that a consortium led by top oil trader Vitol had entered exclusive talks to acquire PetroAfrica, as the company is known, in a bid estimated to be worth up to $2.5 billion. State-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA , which owns 50 percent of the venture, would be the lead seller in such a deal but BTG’s 40 percent stake and Helios Investment Partners’ 10 percent would also be candidates for sale. If PetroAfrica were sold at Vitol’s proposed price, BTG would have to book a loss, however, as the bank paid $1.5 billion for its initial 50 percent stake acquired in 2013, according to the source, who could not speak for attribution because the discussions are private. Although BTG had previously decided in favor of selling the stake, the bank now believes that PetroAfrica, which participates in two deepwater oil exploration blocks off the coast of Nigeria, will start to generate a stable cash flow bringing regular dividends to the bank soon. BTG would still be willing to sell if Vitol were to raise its bid, the source added. BTG, Vitol and PetroAfrica did not immediately comment on the matter. PetroAfrica is one of the last remaining stakes BTG Pactual owns in individual companies. After its founder Andre Esteves was arrested in late 2015 on corruption charges, the bank was forced to shed assets and BTG partners decided to divest illiquid stakes. A Brazilian federal judge acquitted Esteves in July. Earlier on Friday, newspaper Valor Econômico reported that BTG intended to keep its stake in PetroAfrica, but that no decision had yet been made.

2018-09-14,"LONDON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - European carbon, the year’s best-performing commodity, suffered its biggest fall in a decade this week after a surge in prices triggered a call for government intervention and weak auction demand. Losses by a Norwegian power trader that left a $133 million hole in the Nasdaq clearing house’s contingency plan added to market jitters, analysts said. Benchmark EU Allowances (EUAs) jumped 30 percent in just four trading sessions, hitting a 10-year high above 25 euros a tonne, before a sell-off kicked in. They were trading at 19.01 at 1318 GMT on Friday, off about 18 percent on the week. After EUAs jumped to 25 euros, Poland said it was time for the European Commission to act. “The situation calls for intervention. We need to ask the European Commission to look into it,” Energy Minister Krzysztof Tchorzewski told state-run news agency PAP. “It wasn’t the only factor but the call from Poland certainly spooked the market,” one carbon trader said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Poland is wary of high carbon prices as that adds costs for its utilities, which generate most of their power from polluting coal. “It is the first call (for intervention) but I would imagine that the Visgard bloc might follow suit,” said Nick Campbell, a director at consultancy Inspired Energy, referring to the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. The high prices slowed demand at Thursday’s EU EUA auction, however, with a cover ratio of 3.21, lower than recent sales and a signal to traders that demand was dwindling. Other negatives for carbon this week included Thursday’s unwinding of positions across the European energy complex after losses by the Norwegian power trader. “This will make a lot of market participants unsure about trading schemes,” said Martin Andreas Vik, an adviser to the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate. While analysts doubted Poland would be successful in prompting the EU to act to curb carbon prices, the market hitting 25 euros did reignite analysis of reforms set to start next year, including the Market Stability Reserve (MSR), which will remove some surplus EUAs from the market. The EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) charges more than 11,000 energy-intensive factories and power stations for every tonne of carbon dioxide they emit. It was set up in 2005 as part of EU efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 43 percent by 2030. Yet the market has suffered from excess supply since the financial crisis, a problem set to be addressed by measures such as the MSR. Market intervention could also take the form of the EU actually returning surplus EUAs to the market in the event of runaway prices. Reuters analysts estimated prices would have to hold at 25 euros a tonne for six months to meet intervention criteria under article 29a of the EU’s carbon market rules. However, under article 29a, intervention to return allowances would only be triggered if the price rise was not rooted in fundamental reasons. “It would be a tough one to argue that the EUA price rise is purely speculative and not caused by the anticipation of the supply squeeze due to the Market Stability Reserve,” Thomson Reuters carbon analyst Hege Fjellheim said. “The language in the article is open to different interpretations,” Fjellheim said. The European Commission declined to elaborate on how the article would work. One source at the Commission said it welcomed the stronger prices and that conditions to trigger intervention have not been met. Reporting by Susanna Twidale, additional reporting by Alissa

2018-09-14,"LAGOS, Sept 14 (Reuters) - The Nigerian arm of Samsung Heavy Industries is in talks to resolve a court action launched by an industrial zone in the west African country where the company has been building a floating oil platform for Total, Samsung Heavy said on Friday. “We are in discussions to iron out any misunderstanding or issues raised between the parties,” a Samsung spokesperson said in a statement sent to Reuters on Friday. “We are yet to come to the resolution or conclusion but we hope to resolve amicably for our further businesses together.” The LADOL sustainable industrial free zone refused to renew Samsung’s sublease to use a shipyard and filed a court action last week, accusing the company of breaching the terms of their agreement. LADOL’s allegations included that Samsung breached the conditions of service for Nigerian workers, and violated both customs and immigration procedures. Responding to Samsung’s statement, LADOL said it also hoped for an amicable resolution to the dispute, but added: “Failure to maintain the conditions and requirements for operating in the Free Zone will not be tolerated.” Samsung Heavy Industries, one of the world’s largest shipbuilders, says that through its joint venture with LADOL it has invested $300 million to help build a floating oil platform for Total’s Egina oil field. Total describes the field as one of its most ambitious ultra-deep offshore projects. The project is expected to produce an estimated 200,000 barrels of oil per day, representing about 10 percent of Nigeria’s total capacity.

2018-09-14,"LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. will find it difficult to cut Iran’s oil exports completely as the oil market is already tight and rival producers cannot make up the shortfall, a top Iranian official said on Friday. Washington is seeking to cut Iranian oil exports to zero by November as it reimposes sanctions, and is encouraging other producers such as Saudi Arabia, other OPEC members and Russia to pump more to meet the shortfall. Even so, the expected loss of Iranian oil, declining supply from another OPEC member Venezuela and other outages are boosting crude prices, which this week hit $80 a barrel, the highest since May. Iran’s OPEC governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, said in comments to Reuters that a “supply shortage” meant that the United States would not be able to meet its zero export target. “There is no spare capacity anywhere,” he said. A long-time adviser at Saudi Arabia’s Energy Ministry also said last month that current U.S. sanctions on Iran were unlikely to stop Iranian oil exports completely. Under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to lower oil prices, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies agreed in June to boost production, having participated in a supply-cutting deal in place since 2017. While OPEC production has increased since then, Saudi Arabia has added less crude than it initially indicated. Kazempour has voiced scepticism that other producers can add much more oil. The OPEC governor is typically the second most senior post in a country’s OPEC delegation after the oil minister. Kazempour has represented Iran in that position for many years.

In February, Hydro made an offer to buy the aluminum plant, as well as a 53 percent stake in a Dutch anode facility Aluchemie and 50 percent of the shares in a Swedish aluminum fluoride plant Alufluor for about $345 million. “The European Commission competition approval process has taken longer than anticipated and remains outstanding,” Hydro said in a statement.  “After considering alternative timelines, outcomes and developments, Hydro requested to terminate the transaction and the parties have signed a termination agreement,” it said.   Hydro has withdrawn its EU competition filing, it added. Hydro, which is not interested in acquiring aluminum plants that use coal-fired power, was hoping the deal would be part of efforts to make its output as green as possible and bolster its position in Europe.

Analysts said foreign investors sold a net 340.7 million rupees worth of equities on Friday, extending the year-to-date net foreign outflow to 4.8 billion rupees worth of shares. Sentiment was also weighed down by the local currency hitting a fresh low for the third straight session. The Colombo stock index ended 0.49 percent weaker at 6,031.26, its lowest close since Aug. 28. It lost 1.4 percent this week, falling for the fist time in four weeks. The day’s turnover was 786.1 million rupees ($4.81 million), less than this year’s daily average of 799.1 million rupees. “Market is down dominated by foreign selling, fear of rupee depreciation and also fuelled by the Nomura report,” said Reshan Kurukulasuriya, chief operating officer, Richard Pieris Securities (Pvt) Ltd. Japanese bank Nomura Holdings ranked Sri Lanka among seven emerging market economies that were at risk of an exchange rate crisis. However, the Central Bank in a statement said Nomura Holdings has made a serious computational error with regard to Sri Lanka’s external vulnerability and its short-term external debt is nowhere near the $160 billion figure that Nomura analysts quoted. Nomura later corrected the figure to $7.5 billion, but said its analysts have used the same figure to calculate the country’s Damocles score for the analysis and thus it is unchanged. Investors have been raising concerns over consistency in the government’s policy after it changed some budget policies announced last year. Analysts said the fuel price increase also hurt investor confidence as it could hurt earnings of companies. Sri Lankan fuel retailers raised gasoline and diesel prices for a third time in four months on Tuesday due to higher global oil prices and a weaker rupee. Investors are also awaiting cues from the national budget which the government is set to unveil in November.

2018-09-14,"LONDON, Sept 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Dutch cyclists rode down the world’s first bike path made entirely of discarded plastic this week, in a move aimed at reducing the millions of tonnes wasted every year. The 30-metre (100-ft) cycling path in the 1,300-year-old northern town of Zwolle contains the equivalent of 500,000 plastic bottle caps and is estimated to be two to three times more durable than traditional roads. Eight million tonnes of plastic – bottles, packaging and other waste – are dumped into the ocean every year, killing marine life and entering the human food chain, the United Nations Environment Programme has said. “This first pilot is a big step towards a sustainable and future-proof road made of recycled plastic waste,” the path’s inventors Anne Koudstaal and Simon Jorritsma said in a statement. Leading environmental expert Guus Velders welcomed the new initiative by Dutch engineering firm KWS, pipe maker Wavin and French oil major Total, saying it was a “positive step” towards a more circular use of materials. However, Emma Priestland, campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said the solution to plastic pollution lay in preventing its unnecessary use in the first place. “Using plastic to make bicycle paths may help to keep plastics out of landfill and ... but it’s still unclear what happens to this plastic as the surface of the path is worn away,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by email. Cities such as London, Amsterdam and Paris are looking at how they can shift to a circular economy - reusing products, parts and materials, producing no waste or pollution and using fewer new resources and energy. The Dutch government has pledged to halve its use of raw materials by 2030 and accelerate its shift towards a so-called “circular economy”.

2018-09-14,"ABUJA, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s inflation rate rose in August over the previous year for the first time in a year and a half, driven by food prices, the statistics office said on Friday. The slight jump, from 11.14 percent in July to 11.23 percent in August, curtails an 18-month run of falling rates from a peak of 18.72 percent in January 2017, as President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration battled to keep inflation under control. Food prices rose 13.16 percent over the previous year, versus 12.85 percent in the previous month. Now, the main factor to watch is “when and by how much pre-election spending kicks in, pressuring inflation,” said Razia Khan, Standard Charter’s chief economist for Africa. “For now, we don’t see it in core inflation,” she said.

The magazine said the board was due to decide whether Stadler, who has been in police custody since mid-June as part of a broader probe into emissions cheating at Audi, should give up his position. Citing sources close to the company, Spiegel said it was probable that Stadler would be asked to relinquish the role, seeing as he was unable to perform the duties of an executive. Both VW and Audi have said that Stadler is presumed innocent unless proven otherwise. A source told Reuters the reason for the supervisory board meeting was to discuss further steps towards a possible listing of VW’s truck and bus subsidiary and not Stadler. However, sources close to the company expect that the board will also talk about Stadler although no decisions are expected. Volkswagen declined to comment on the report. In July, Volkswagen recruited BMW (BMWG.DE) engine development and purchasing expert Markus Duesmann, who has been touted as a potential successor to Stadler as VW looks for clean-engine expertise to help it shake off the emissions scandal.

That would comply with a broader anti-pollution plan reported by Reuters this week that the central government is considering to avoid blanket cuts during winter season. It would also create more incentives to polluting companies to adopt nuanced emission reduction techniques. The measures would start on Oct. 1 and end on March 31, 2019, an earlier start than last year’s measures that took effect on Nov. 1. Industrial plants in the steel, coke, casting, construction materials, pharmaceuticals and pesticide sectors in the smog-prone city will need to cut output by between 30 percent and 70 percent based on their emission levels, according to a draft document issued by the Tangshan city government reviewed by Reuters. Three sources who received the noticed confirmed its authenticity. The Tangshan government did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Companies that reach tough ultra-low emission targets and use rail or heavy-duty trucks powered by clean energy and diesel that meets the National Five standard or higher would be exempt from the winter cuts, the document shows.

2018-09-14,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is racing to secure power supplies ahead of winter after a devastating quake left 41 people dead and damaged generating stations on the northern island of Hokkaido, where temperatures regularly drop well below zero in colder months.  Although the government has eased an initial 20 percent power-savings target for residential and business customers on the island of 5.3 million, Japan’s trade and industry minister Hiroshige Seko has said power supplies on Hokkaido will remain tight and unspecified savings are still needed.  Regional utility Hokkaido Electric Power is rushing to repair broken generators and bring on idle power plants, but those efforts will come up against the brutal reality of winter in Hokkaido, where temperatures can reach as low as minus 41 Celsius (minus 42 Fahrenheit).  Power demand on Hokkaido in winter is typically more than a third higher than in the warmer months before the quake.  “The harsh reality is that we have to ask for power savings every winter in Hokkaido,” trade and industry minister Seko told reporters on Friday.  Asked if he was confident there would be enough supply to cope with the rise in demand, Seko said it was too early to say.  Temperatures in urban areas on the island are already dropping below 10 Celsius in early morning hours, while snow was recorded in the mountains of northern Hokkaido on Aug. 17, the earliest snowfall since 1974, local press have reported.  Sufficient power supplies for winter heating may depend on whether Hokkaido Electric can get its biggest coal-fired plant - Tomato-Atsuma - fully operational after the quake damaged all three generators at the station, Seko said.  On Tuesday, Seko said his ministry will investigate Hokkaido Electric’s response to the quake, which left an island the size of Austria without power after Tomato-Atsuma was shut down. It was the nation’s worst outage since the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that devastated northeastern Japan.  MAP: Earthquake in Hokkaido - tmsnrt.rs/2oJz6zd Fully restarting the Tomato-Atsuma power station, will take more than a month, Seko said earlier this week.  Hokkaido Electric engineers cannot inspect its No. 4 unit, the biggest, because it is still too hot after a fire broke out in its turbine, a company spokesman told Reuters by phone. Depending on the damage, repairing or replacing turbines can take weeks or months.           To cover the shortage, the utility brought online by Friday afternoon two hydro-electric units at its Kyogoku plant. By November, Hokkaido Electric says it also plans to restart three oil-fired units undergoing maintenance.  It is also firing up a coal power station it planned to mothball early next year and another oil-fired station it had planned to close next year, the utility has said.  The utility will as well start testing a new gas-fired power station next month, but the spokesman said the utility was not sure the unit would be ready ahead of winter.  Hokkaido can count only on limited supplies from the main island of Honshu because of the fragmented nature of Japan’s power grid.  Power demand on Hokkaido peaked at 5.25 gigawatts last winter, according to Hokkaido Electric. That compares with about 3.83 gigawatts on the day before the quake struck.  About 3.5 GW of power are now available including from the Honshu connection, said the Hokkaido Electric spokesman.  Temperatures fell to 5.9 Celsius in Asahikawa, Hokkaido’s second-biggest city, on Wednesday, and averaged minus 4.3 Celsius there during December last year.  Japan’s record low temperature was minus 41 Celsius in Asahikawa in 1902.

2018-09-14,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Most new diesel vehicles exceed the legal limit for nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, German environmental lobby group DUH said on Friday, calling on the government to force car companies to carry out hardware retrofits of polluting cars. Almost three years after Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted to deliberately cheating U.S. pollution tests, Germany’s car industry, which employs some 800,000 people and is the country’s biggest exporter, is under intense pressure to cut diesel fumes.  A court ruled last week that Frankfurt, Germany’s financial centre, must ban highly-polluting, older diesel vehicles from the city centre from next February as part of a plan to improve air quality. The city of Hamburg this year voluntarily blocked older diesel models from using selected trunk roads. Other cities including Aachen, Duesseldorf and Stuttgart, home to Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and Porsche (VOWG_p.DE), are also considering bans.    Juergen Resch, head of the DUH, a lobby group which has advocated banning polluting cars from roads, told a news conference its tests showed the latest Euro-6 emissions-control technology was just as dirty as older versions. Resch said tests carried about by the DUH’s Emissions Control Institute (EKI) found models of the Euro-6 diesel generation released NOx on average 5.5 times the legal limit when tested in real driving conditions. Only 8.4 percent of vehicles kept to the legal ceiling for NOx of 80 milligrams/kilometre, he added. “We’ve had enough and believe the German chancellor must act,” Resch said. Remo Klinger, a lawyer for the DUH, said the association planned to submit a further seven suits against the towns of Hagen, Bielefeld, Freiburg, Limburg, Oberhausen, Oldenburg, and Wuppertal for violating air quality. This brings the total number of suits to 32, it said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she will do everything possible to avoid driving bans, but disagreements over how to tackle the problem of diesel cars with high NOx emissions have strained her coalition with the Social Democrats. A working group of German government officials and car industry lobbyists has recommended hardware retrofits for older diesel vehicles as a way to avert inner-city bans. The government said it is due to decide soon whether costly retrofits are appropriate.

2018-09-14,"LONDON (Reuters) - Rising risk aversion drove the biggest outflows in 11 weeks from world stocks and emerging debt over the past week, alongside a sharp increase in cash allocations, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) said on Friday.  Data from BAML, which tracks fund flows from Wednesday to Wednesday, said the week had seen $5.6 billion exit world equity funds, with U.S. stocks accounting for $2.3 billion outflows while emerging market equities lost a “notable” $1.2 billion. European equities lost $1.4 billion, seeing outflows for 26 of the past 27 weeks, BAML said, describing the moves as the “September pain trade”. This month’s intensifying market tensions coincide with the tenth anniversary of the Lehman Brothers collapse which sent world markets and the global economy into a tailspin.  Another casualty of risk-off sentiment was emerging market debt, which saw outflows of $1.6 billion — the largest in 11 weeks. Investors’ appetite for riskier assets has been hit hard by the simmering trade conflict between the United States and China, as well as turmoil in emerging markets where some currencies have lost 40-50 percent of their value this year. That has sparked a dash for government bonds from developed countries which saw inflows of $1.7 billion, according to BAML. Markets are also long on cash — a typical sign of risk aversion — the data showed. BAML said its clients’ allocation to two-year Treasury bills, a proxy for cash, was at the highest since Sept 2008. Still, there could finally be some positive signs for battered emerging markets. BAML said this year’s combo of price capitulation and hefty flows had sparked big market rallies in eight out of nine occasions since 2009. “Nineteen of 23 emerging market indexes are now big oversold but we need $11 billion emerging market equity outflows (this week to confirm the signal),” BAML said in the note. A larger-than-expected hike in Turkish interest rates on Thursday and hopes of new round of talks to reduce trade tensions between the United States and China have boosted markets as this week draws to an end.  MSCI’s emerging market stock index was up more than 1 percent on Friday.  Commenting on the anniversary of the Lehman collapse, BAML said one of the biggest trends since the crisis was the $2.5 trillion of inflow into passive funds, compared to $2 trillion outflow from active ones. Bond markets have been another big winner, BAML said, noting flows of $2.2 trillion into bonds versus $0.7 trillion into equities since 2009.

2018-09-14,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Shares rose around the world on Friday as expectations grew that the United States and China would open new trade talks, while an interest rate hike in Turkey supported the lira and global risk appetite. The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up nearly half a percent on the day after the start of trade in Europe. Led by technology and autos stocks, the pan-European STOXX 600 index rose half a percent, set for its best weekly gains in seven weeks. Tech stocks rose 0.7 percent after Apple gained on Wall Street following Europe’s close. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 1.2 percent. Australian shares were up 0.6 percent, Seoul’s Kospi rose 1.4 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei stock index was 1.2 percent higher. Those rises followed gains on Wall Street Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending 0.57 percent higher, the S&P 500 gaining 0.53 percent and the Nasdaq Composite adding 0.75 percent. Chinese shares fell, despite a short-lived bump from data that showed forecast-topping industrial output and retail sales data for August. Other data showed real estate investment in the country fell in August, raising concern that a cooling property market could increase risks for China’s economic outlook as the trade environment worsens. China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite index was down 0.2 percent and the blue-chip CSI300 index rose 0.2 percent. Chinese officials welcomed an invitation from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for new talks. But U.S. President Donald Trump tempered market expectations, tweeting on Thursday that the U.S. is “under no pressure to make a deal with China” . The Trump administration is readying a final list of $200 billion worth of Chinese imports that it plans to levy tariffs on in coming days. That move would mark an escalation in the trade war and could significantly slow global growth. Analysts at Capital Economics noted that Mnuchin had struck a deal with China in May that was scuppered days later by Trump. “As a result, he has little credibility with Chinese policymakers,” they said. On Friday, the state-run English-language newspaper China Daily said in an editorial that China would not “surrender” to U.S. demands and “will not hesitate to take countermeasures against U.S. tariffs to safeguard China’s interests” . Uncertainty around the global outlook for trade was highlighted by the European Central Bank, which on Thursday kept policy unchanged as expected and warned that risks from protectionism were growing. ‘EYE-WATERING’ A sharp interest rate increase by Turkey’s central bank to support a tumbling lira boosted risk appetite in emerging markets. The bank hiked its benchmark interest rate by 625 basis points, to 24 percent. Currency crises in both Turkey and Argentina have stoked fears of contagion over the past several weeks, hammering emerging market assets from Indonesia to India to South Africa. After rising as high as 6.1442 to the dollar, the lira eased slightly to 6.0768 on Friday. Turkish lira implied volatility gauges fell to their lowest levels in more than a month on Friday, as sentiment continued to improve. “The bold decision (by Turkey’s central bank) reduces the risk that a full-scale financial crisis may unfold,” wrote analysts at Rabobank in a note to clients. “That said, it’s only the first step and we remain of the view that a rate hike on its own may not prove sufficient to lead to a sustainable recovery in the lira. The central bank’s efforts must be accompanied by an implementation of constructive macro prudential policies by the administration.” The euro hit a two-week high, extending Thursday’s gains after comments from ECB President Mario Draghi that focused on healthy domestic fundamentals, including rapid growth in employment and a rise in wages . The pound reached a six-week high of $1.3139, up 0.3 percent and set for its second biggest weekly rise of 2018. The dollar eased 0.1 percent against the yen to 111.82 .

2018-09-14,"ANDOVER, Mass., Sept 14 (Reuters) - Dozens of gas explosions killed at least one person, injured 12 more and forced thousands to evacuate from three communities north of Boston on Thursday. Some 8,000 people were displaced after the blasts leveled dozens of homes and other buildings in Andover, North Andover and Lawrence. Firefighters raced for hours from one blaze to another and utility crews rushed to shut off gas and electricity to prevent further ignitions. A 18-year-old Lawrence man, Leonel Rondon, died when an explosion caused a chimney to fall on his car, a spokeswoman at Massachusetts General Hospital said. Lawrence General Hospital said it had treated 13 people for injuries ranging from smoke inhalation to blast trauma. “This has been obviously an incredibly difficult day,” Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker said in a news conference early on Friday. Some 70 fires, explosions or investigations of gas odor were reported, Massachusetts State Police said. Fire investigators suspected “over-pressurization of a gas main” belonging to Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, a unit of the utility NiSource Inc, caused the explosions, Andover Fire Chief Michael Mansfield told a news conference. Baker said that he told the utility company that it must bring in additional resources and develop a comprehensive safety plan for each of the communities. “At this time, the focus remains on ensuring the public safety,” Baker said. “Once that’s complete, we will work with federal government and others to investigate how this occurred and hold the appropriate parties accountable for their actions.” NiSource spokesman Ken Stammen said Columbia Gas was investigating. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration said it was sending a team to support the state’s emergency response efforts. The former head of the agency, Brigham McCown, called the series of gas explosions “unprecedented, at least in recent memory.” The National Transportation Safety Board have a team of investigators headed to the area, officials said. The Federal Bureau of Investigation also was sending investigators, the Boston Globe reported. Fire and utility crews were going door to door overnight to conduct safety checks, officials said. Guilia Holland, a 35-year-old mechanic in a wheelchair, said she had just gotten off a bus returning home when she saw “a big flash of light” at the house where she had been renting a room for a month. “Good thing I wasn’t home or I wouldn’t be talking about it,” she said outside an elementary school in Lawrence that the Red Cross had converted into a shelter for about 170 people. South Lawrence Mayor Daniel Rivera urged residents to stay away from their homes. “There could be still a gas leak in your home,” Rivera said. “You can’t see it and in some cases you won’t be able to smell it and God forbid you go to sleep and don’t wake up.” (Additional reporting by Ross Kerber and Nate Raymond in Boston and Brendan O’Brien in Milwaukee; editing by Larry King)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/massachusetts-explosions/one-dead-a-dozen-injured-in-gas-blasts-in-boston-suburbs-idUKL2N1W007C,14 Sep 2018,"Dozens of gas explosions

2018-09-14,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Several independent Chinese refineries are drawing up plans to build petrochemical complexes in east China’s Shandong province, aiming to join an investment boom in the world’s top chemicals market. China is allowing greater access by global players and independent local companies to build new plants to help narrow an import gap of plastics, rubber and polyester as middle-class consumers chase high-end goods from cars to electronics. U.S. major Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Germany’s BASF (BASFn.DE) have announced multi-billion-dollar investments over the past two months as they look to rival local firms like Hengli Group and Zhejiang Rongsheng. Facing tight cash flows and fierce competition in a saturated fuel market, China’s small refiners, known as “teapots”, are also eyeing petrochemicals as a potential growth area, although analysts warn they will face big challenges in logistics and funding. “The widely accepted notion among Shandong refiners is that if you don’t move into petrochemicals quickly enough you’ll die faster,” said an executive at a Shandong refiner. Shandong Shouguang Luqing Petrochemical Corp and Shandong Chambroad Group have each hired a state-run engineering firm for plant design, including processing technologies and capital spending estimates, said a second industry executive with knowledge of the matter. He did not give details of products or plant size being considered, but said that for a petrochemical complex to be competitive it needs at least a 1 million tonne per year (tpy)  ethylene plant plus about a dozen units making products from polyethylene to aromatics. The two executives declined to be named as the plans are at an early stage and not yet public. Media relations officials at Chambroad and Shouguang Luqing declined to comment.     Other teapots have been mulling similar projects.  For a map showing the existing and planned petrochemical hubs along China’s east coast, click  tmsnrt.rs/2PzGcl9 Wanda Tianhong Group is waiting for government feedback after submitting in March a proposal to build a 1.2 million tpy ethylene facility in Dongying, said a company executive.  Shandong Lihuayi Group is eyeing a 1 million tpy plant to make paraxylene, an intermediate for polyester, said a company official.   China’s nearly 40 independent refineries enjoyed several years of bumper profits after they were allowed to process imported crude oil in 2015. But their fortunes have dwindled due to tighter tax scrutiny and a ban on fuel exports, while looming competition from newer, larger private refiners is set to squeeze margins further.  Some have already moved into new areas. Shandong Haike Group opened a new factory that makes electrolytes used in lithium batteries for electric vehicles in April. The push into petrochemicals, however, would involve a minimum spend of at least $2 billion, analysts said, which would pose challenges. “Large state-owned banks will be reluctant to loan to teapots for such large fixed asset spending because of the uncertain prospects,” said an executive at a Shanghai-based state-owned lender who funds teapots for oil imports. Located inland with no easy access to deep-water berths, Chambroad and Luqing and similarly located Shandong refineries are at a logistical disadvantage compared with petrochemical plants in coastal areas and closer to consumers.  “I doubt any teapot in Shandong can invest in big ethylene plants under current circumstances. It needs large capex,” said Seng-Yick Tee of consultancy SIA Energy.

2018-09-14,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian refiners will cut their monthly crude loadings from Iran for September and October by nearly half from earlier this year as New Delhi works to win waivers on the oil export sanctions Washington plans to reimpose on Tehran in November.  India’s loadings from Iran for this month and next will drop  to less than 12 million barrels each, after purchases over April-August had been boosted in anticipation of the reductions.  The United States is renewing sanctions on Iran after withdrawing from a nuclear deal forged in 2015 between Tehran and world powers. Washington reimposed some of the financial sanctions from Aug. 6, while those affecting Iran’s petroleum sector will come into force from Nov. 4.  India, Iran’s No.2 oil client behind top buyer China, does  not recognize the reimposed U.S. sanctions, but winning a waiver from the restrictions is a must for New Delhi to protect its wider exposure to the U.S. financial system.  India’s oil ministry in June told refiners to prepare for a “drastic reduction or zero” imports from Iran from November.  “Some refiners have either already exhausted or front-loaded their term contract to a large extent, which allows them the flexibility to go to zero if required, or until clarity on the waivers emerge,” Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at Energy Aspect, told Reuters.  Washington will consider waivers for Iranian oil buyers such as India but they must eventually halt crude imports from Tehran, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week in New Delhi after a meeting of high level officials.  The Indian government, already facing a backlash over a falling rupee INR=D2 and record high fuel prices, does not want to halt the oil imports from Iran as the Islamic republic offers a discount on oil sales to India.  Government sources said India made this point clear in last week’s meetings with U.S. officials and remains engaged with Washington to work out waivers on its oil purchases from Iran.  “We have a special relationship with both the U.S. and with Iran, and we are seeing how to balance this all, and also to balance out the interest of the refiners and end-consumers,” said one of the government officials.  But if Washington adopts a tough line, India would have no other choice than to end imports from Iran, they said.  India lifted about 658,000 barrel of oil per day (bpd) from Iran in April-August, according to data obtained from trade sources by Reuters, and the cuts projected for September and October would drop the daily average over those two months by about 45 percent to 360,000-370,000 bpd.  Indian oil refiners have already given the October loading plans to the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC), sources familiar with the loading schedule said.  Top refiner Indian Oil Corp (IOC.NS) wants to lift 6 million barrels each in September and October, while Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals (MRPL.NS) would load 3 million barrels each for those two months, the sources said.  IOC would also lift 1 million barrel for its subsidiary Chennai Petroleum Corp (CHPC.NS) in October, they said.  Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL.NS) would lift 1 million barrels in September and skip purchases in October, a company source said on Tuesday.  Bharat Petroleum has already drawn more than its fixed volumes - the amount it is obligated to purchase - that were contracted for 2018/19, its chairman said on Tuesday.  Nayara Energy, part owned by Russian oil giant Rosneft (ROSN.MM), plans to lift 1 million barrels each in September and October, the sources said. But the refiner began reducing its oil imports from Iran in June and aims to completely halt purchases from November.  Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL.NS), Reliance Industries (RELI.NS) and HPCL Mittal Energy (HMEL) have no plans to buy from Iran in September and October, they said.  India refiners - excluding Reliance and HMEL, which do not have term contracts with Iran - will together lift about 73  percent of their fixed contract volumes from Iran by end-October, the loading data showed.  IOC, Nayara and MRPL did not respond to Reuters’ emails seeking comments.

2018-09-14,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Steel mills in Tangshan, China’s top steelmaking city, are rushing to install equipment to meet new ‘ultra-low’ emissions targets by an Oct. 31 deadline, as the measures to battle pollution threaten more upheaval in the debt-laden sector. Only a handful of mills have installed the technology that removes sulfur, nitrogen and dust and costs up to 200 million yuan ($29 million), according to analysts who have tracked the more than 150 sintering plants in the city affected by the new rules, which were only announced in July. “Everyone is trying to speed up the (upgrade) project ... Still, time is very tight,” said an environmental manager at Hebei Donghai Special Steel Co, a privately owned mill with annual capacity of 10 million tonnes. She declined to be named as she is not authorized to talk to media. The environment ministry said in February it would enforce tough new emissions on steel mills, but did not give details. In July, the Tangshan city government ordered companies in the steel, coke and coal-fired power sectors to comply with the new standards and gave mills until end-October to meet the targets. Until last week, only five of the 152 sintering machines in Tangshan that need to be upgraded have met the stricter emissions targets, according to research by analysts at Huatai Futures and Guosen Securities. Much is at stake for mills. Those that comply with the restrictions in time will be exempt from curbs to output during the winter heating season.  If they miss the deadline, they will have to cut output and the government has warned that some sintering plants may be shut down.     This is the second year that China will force steel mills, aluminum smelters and other heavy industry in the smoggiest northern regions to cut output during winter to counter a rise in emissions from the country’s coal-fired power stations due to increased demand for heating. Tangshan Delong Steel Co Ltd, a privately owned mill with annual capacity of 2.4 million tonnes, started work on its upgrade last year and is one of the first to comply with the new standards. “It takes time to install and test the devices,” said Kan Ruimin, manager at the engineering department. Mills must cut the concentration of particulate matters to 10 micrograms per cubic meter from 40 micrograms, while sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide concentrations must drop to 35 micrograms from 180 and to 50 micrograms from 300, respectively.  “Big mills are enforcing the emission regulations, but for some debt-laden producers, funding is a big obstacle,” said Zhao Yu, steel analyst at Huatai Futures. Closures of sintering plants will likely spur demand for iron ore pellets, adding further upwards pressure on prices, which have risen a third this year, Zhao said. Iron ore fines go through a highly pollutive sintering process before they are thrown into the furnace to make steel. Higher grade iron ore pellets can go straight into the furnace, avoiding that process.  Reporting by Muyu Xu and Josephine Mason; editing by Richard Pullin",https://uk.reuters.com/article/china-pollution-steel/ahead-of-winter-chinese-steel-mills-rush-to-meet-stricter-smog-rules-idUKL3N1VY56W,14 Sep 2018,"Steel mills in Tangshan,

2018-09-14,"* MSCI Asia Ex-Japan +1.2 pct, Nikkei +1.2 pct * European markets seen opening higher * China indexes waver on mixed data dump * China state media says China will not “surrender” to U.S. trade demands By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Asian shares rose on Friday as the United States and China looked set to launch a new round of trade talks amid an escalating tariff row, while a decisive interest rate hike by Turkey’s central bank also helped support global risk appetite. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.2 percent, putting it on track for its best performance in more than two weeks. Australian shares ended up 0.7 percent, Seoul’s Kospi was up 1.4 percent higher and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng climbed 0.9 percent. Japan’s Nikkei stock index ended 1.2 percent higher. Shares in Europe are expected to follow Asia higher, with spreadbetters tipping London’s FTSE to open 0.2 percent higher, Frankfurt’s DAX and Paris’ CAC 0.3 percent up each. But Chinese shares struggled, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite index falling less than 0.1 percent, having spent much of the day wavering between gains and losses. Investors in China were assessing new data showing forecast-topping industrial output and retail sales data for August alongside falling real estate investment. There were underlying  concerns that a cooling property market could increase risks for the economic outlook as the trade environment worsens. China’s blue-chip CSI300 index turned around from earlier losses to gain 0.2 percent. “What the market wants is some degree of certainty,” said Jim McCafferty, head of Equity Research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura. “I think everyone knows that the trade deal might not be as optimistic as it might have been in ... June or July, and it might be negative for many Chinese companies. But the fact that there’s no certainty there is one reason that investors are staying on the sidelines.” News of a possible new round of talks between Washington and Beijing comes even as the trade war between the world’s two largest economies looks set to escalate. Chinese officials welcomed an invitation from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for new talks. But U.S. President Donald Trump tempered market expectations, tweeting on Thursday that the U.S. is “under no pressure to make a deal with China.” The Trump administration is readying a final list of $200 billion in Chinese imports on which it plans to levy tariffs in the coming days, a move that many fear would mark a severe escalation in the trade war and put a significant dent in global growth. “The news on Wednesday that US officials had invited China to restart trade talks suggests that the announcement of tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports may be delayed. But we think the chance that fresh talks will defuse trade tensions is low,” Capital Economics analysts said in a note. The analysts noted that Mnuchin had brokered a deal with China in May that was scuppered days later by Trump. “As a result, he has little credibility with Chinese policymakers,” they said. On Friday, the state-run English-language China Daily newspaper said in an editorial that China would not “surrender” to U.S. demands, and that Beijing “will not hesitate to take countermeasures against U.S. tariffs to safeguard China’s interests.” Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi, the country’s top diplomat, also put trade into the spotlight on Friday, commenting that the current world trade system is not perfect and China supports reforms to it. Uncertainty around the global outlook for trade was highlighted by the European Central Bank, which on Thursday kept policy unchanged as expected and warned that risks from protectionism were gaining prominence. ‘EYE-WATERING’ But a sharp interest rate hike by Turkey’s central bank to support a tumbling lira boosted risk appetite in emerging markets. In a rare show of independence, the bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 625 basis points, to 24 percent. The bank raised the rate even after it came under criticism by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who repeated his opposition to high interest rates on Thursday and said high inflation was a result of the central bank’s wrong steps. Currency crises both in Turkey and Argentina have stoked fears of contagion over the past several weeks, hammering emerging market assets from Indonesia to India to South Africa. After rising as high as 6.01 to the dollar, the lira was at 6.1050 on Friday. “The Turkish Central Bank seems to have regained some credibility after hiking rates to an eye-watering 24 percent. This move looks to have reset investor expectations for the lira and let some investors breathe a sigh of relief,” said Hannah Anderson, Global Market Strategist, J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “However, this is not enough to assuage all investor worries about EM. Individual emerging markets are being buffeted by highly local cross currents in the context of broader negative sentiment around EMs.” The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 2.9701 percent compared with its U.S. close of 2.964 percent on Thursday. The two-year yield, sensitive to expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 2.7611 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.756 percent. The two-year yield fell Thursday after data showed U.S. consumer prices rose less than expected in August, and underlying inflation pressures also appeared to be slowing, suggesting the Federal Reserve’s pace of rate hikes could slow. The euro was up 0.04 percent at $1.1693 after rising on Thursday on comments from ECB President Mario Draghi that focused on healthy domestic fundamentals, including rapid growth in employment and a rise in wages. The pound also edged 0.04 percent higher to $1.3110. On Thursday, the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold and highlighted greater financial market concerns about Brexit, a month after raising borrowing costs for only the second time in more than a decade. The dollar eased 0.07 percent against the yen to 111.84 . U.S. crude was 0.3 percent higher at $68.79 a barrel as Hurricane Florence approached the U.S. east coast.

2018-09-14,"* Crude oil output up yr-on-yr for first time since Oct 2015 * But year-to-date production still down 2 pct * Crude runs fall to lowest since December * Gas output rises ahead of critical winter heating season (Recasts on rise in output, adds comment) BEIJING, Sept 14 (Reuters) - China’s crude oil output rose in August for the first time in nearly three years, data showed on Friday, climbing after President Xi Jinping called for a boost to national energy security amid trade tensions with the United States. Monthly crude oil output hit 16 million tonnes, or 3.77 million bpd, up 0.2 percent from August last year and marking the first year-on-year increase in tonnes and barrels per day (bpd) since October 2015, according to the data from National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Year-to-date output was 125.95 million tonnes, down 1.8 percent from a year earlier. That equates to 3.78 million bpd. National energy majors raised output in August as international oil prices approached $80 a barrel and after the state call to ramp up local oil and gas output amid the escalating trade war with the United States, experts said. “The state oil companies need to show some sort of support for President Xi’s call to boost domestic supplies,” said Seng-Yick Tee at consultancy SIA Energy. Most Chinese oilfields can break even with oil at $70 per barrel, he added. Benchmark global prices stood at around $78 on Friday. The data also showed China’s crude processing rate fell in August to its lowest since December, with independent refiners prolonging maintenance shutdowns as higher oil prices and a new tax regime ate into margins. China refined 50.31 million tonnes of crude oil in August, or 11.85 million barrels per day (bpd), up 5.6 from a year ago. The pace of processing fell from 11.95 million bpd in July and compared with a record-high of 12.13 million bpd in March. For the first eight months, crude runs were up 8.7 percent at 400.41 million tonnes, or 12.03 million bpd. Meanwhile, China’s natural gas production rose 9.7 percent in August over the same year-ago level to 12.9 billion cubic metres (bcm). That was down from 12.96 bcm in July. Output for the year-to-date was 104 bcm, up 5.9 percent as producers gear up for peak-demand over winter, with the country continuing its drive to switch households and businesses to gas for heating.

The blasts left dozens of homes and other buildings demolished or engulfed in flames as firefighters from some 50 departments raced for hours from one blaze to another and utility crews rushed to shut off gas and electricity in the area to prevent further ignitions. Police drove up and down streets with bull horns telling residents to vacate their homes immediately. Fire investigators suspected “over-pressurization of a gas main” belonging to Columbia Gas of Massachusetts led to the series of explosions and fires, Andover Fire Chief Michael Mansfield told a news conference.

However, it was not immediately known whether any work was being done in those communities at the time. “Columbia Gas is investigating what happened on its system today,” NiSource spokesman Ken Stammen said. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) said it was sending a team to support the state’s emergency response efforts. The former head of the agency, Brigham McCown, called the series of gas explosions “unprecedented, at least in recent memory.” “I can’t think of a series of natural gas-related incidents like this,” McCown, who led PHMSA under President George W. Bush, told Reuters by telephone. “We have had similar issues on a much smaller scale.” He said the National Transportation Safety Board was also sending a team headed by its chairman, Robert Sumwalt, to investigate the disaster. Live TV images showed firefighters battling blazes in the former mill towns of Lawrence, Andover and North Andover, about 25 miles (40 km) north of the Massachusetts capital. The streets were darkened after nightfall with power cut off to the area as a precaution. Lawrence General Hospital said on its Facebook page it treated 13 people for injuries ranging from smoke inhalation to blast trauma. One of those patients, who was in critical condition, was transported to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Officials told Reuters that patient later died. At least three people, including one firefighter, were hurt in Andover, the town said in a statement, but it was unclear whether any of those individuals were among the patients treated in Lawrence, some of whom were later released. “This has been an overwhelming event,” Mansfield told reporters, saying that fire companies responding to blazes were putting one house fire out only to discover another house on fire as they finished their work. “This event is not over tonight. This event will probably go on.” Massachusetts State Police said a total of 70 fires, explosions or investigations of gas odor had been reported. Some 50 fire departments responded to the emergency, said John McArdle, fire chief of Plaistow, New Hampshire, which sent a tower ladder and engine crew to the scene. North Andover resident Laurie Williams, 55, said she drove home from work to find police and fire vehicles blocking streets near her home and learned that three buildings nearby were on fire. “It was very scary,” Williams told Reuters by telephone, saying she could see smoke on the skyline. “My first thought was this is a gas explosion.” State police urged residents served by Columbia Gas to evacuate their homes. Lawrence Mayor Dan Rivera said residents in the southern part of the city had been asked to leave their homes whether or not they were Columbia Gas customers, due to planned power cuts. Gas utilities have come under heightened scrutiny in recent years for an aging network of pipelines that critics say are not being properly inspected and maintained, posing a growing risk to public safety. Friday’s conflagrations came six years after Columbia Gas accepted blame for a gas explosion in Springfield, Massachusetts, that injured 17 people and caused an estimated $1.3 million in property damage That occurred when a Columbia Gas technician called to investigate a gas odor at a nightclub accidentally punctured a line, the state Department of Public Utilities said in a report.

2018-09-14,"* MSCI Asia Ex-Japan +0.8 pct, Nikkei +1.0 pct * China indexes waver between gains and losses * China state media says China will not “surrender” to U.S. trade demands By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Shares across most of Asia rose on Friday on expectations that the United States and China could launch a fresh round of trade talks, and as a surprisingly sharp interest rate hike in crisis-hit Turkey supported the lira and global risk appetite. But stocks in China fell amid lingering uncertainty over the outlook for trade. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.8 percent, with Australian shares up 0.6 percent, Seoul’s Kospi gaining 1.3 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng up 0.7 percent. Japan’s Nikkei stock index was 1 percent higher. Those rises followed gains on Wall Street Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending 0.57 percent higher, the S&P 500 gaining 0.53 percent and the Nasdaq Composite adding 0.75 percent. But Chinese shares fell, despite a short-lived bump from data that showed forecast-topping industrial output and retail sales data for August. Other data showed real estate investment in the country fell in August, raising concerns that a cooling property market could increase risks for China’s economic outlook as the trade environment worsens. China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite index was down 0.3 percent and the blue-chip CSI300 index eased 0.2 percent. Both indexes had wavered between gains and losses in the morning session. “What the market wants is some degree of certainty,” said Jim McCafferty, head of Equity Research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura. “I think everyone knows that the trade deal might not be as optimistic as it might have been in ... June or July, and it might be negative for many Chinese companies. But the fact that there’s no certainty there is one reason that investors are staying on the sidelines.” News of a possible new round of talks between Washington and Beijing comes even as the trade war between the world’s two largest economies looks set to escalate. Chinese officials welcomed an invitation from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for new talks. But U.S. President Donald Trump tempered market expectations, tweeting on Thursday that the U.S. is “under no pressure to make a deal with China.” The Trump administration is readying a final list of $200 billion in Chinese imports on which it plans to levy tariffs in the coming days, a move that many fear would mark a severe escalation in the trade war and put a significant dent in global growth. “The news on Wednesday that US officials had invited China to restart trade talks suggests that the announcement of tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports may be delayed. But we think the chance that fresh talks will defuse trade tensions is low,” Capital Economics analysts said in a note. The analysts noted that Mnuchin had brokered a deal with China in May that was scuppered days later by Trump. “As a result, he has little credibility with Chinese policymakers,” they said. On Friday, the state-run English-language China Daily newspaper said in an editorial that China would not “surrender” to U.S. demands, and that Beijing “will not hesitate to take countermeasures against U.S. tariffs to safeguard China’s interests.” Uncertainty around the global outlook for trade was highlighted by the European Central Bank, which on Thursday kept policy unchanged as expected and warned that risks from protectionism were gaining prominence. ‘EYE-WATERING’ But a sharp interest rate hike by Turkey’s central bank to support a tumbling lira boosted risk appetite in emerging markets. In a rare show of independence, the bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 625 basis points, to 24 percent. Currency crises both in Turkey and Argentina have stoked fears of contagion over the past several weeks, hammering emerging market assets from Indonesia to India to South Africa. After rising as high as 6.01 to the dollar, the lira weakened slightly to 6.1275 on Friday. “The Turkish Central Bank seems to have regained some credibility after hiking rates to an eye-watering 24 percent. This move looks to have reset investor expectations for the lira and let some investors breathe a sigh of relief,” said Hannah Anderson, Global Market Strategist, J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “However, this is not enough to assuage all investor worries about EM. Individual emerging markets are being buffeted by highly local cross currents in the context of broader negative sentiment around EMs.” The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 2.9718 percent compared with its U.S. close of 2.964 percent on Thursday. The two-year yield, sensitive to expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 2.7565 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.756 percent. The two-year yield fell Thursday after data showed U.S. consumer prices rose less than expected in August, and underlying inflation pressures also appeared to be slowing, suggesting the Federal Reserve’s pace of rate hikes could slow. The euro was up 0.06 percent at $1.1695 after rising on Thursday on comments from ECB President Mario Draghi that focused on healthy domestic fundamentals, including rapid growth in employment and a rise in wages. The pound edged 0.1 percent higher at $1.3118. On Thursday, the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold and highlighted greater financial market concerns about Brexit, a month after raising borrowing costs for only the second time in more than a decade. The dollar eased 0.04 percent against the yen to 111.87 . U.S. crude was 0.2 percent higher at $68.75 a barrel as Hurricane Florence approached the U.S. east coast. Brent crude rose less than 0.1 percent to $78.23 per barrel. Spot gold gained 0.35 percent $1204.96 per ounce. Reporting by Andrew Galbraith

2018-09-14,"* August aluminium output at 2.84 mln T -stats bureau * Lowest on a daily basis since May -Reuters calculations * Smelter margins falling sharply on high alumina costs -analyst * Non-ferrous output at 4.54 mln T, down 1.8 pct from July (Adds analyst comment, alumina market background) By Tom Daly BEIJING, Sept 14 (Reuters) - China’s aluminium producers cut output by 3 percent in August from the month before, government data showed on Friday, as high raw material costs squeeze their profit margins. China, the world’s biggest aluminium producer, churned out 2.84 million tonnes of the metal last month, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). That was down from 2.93 million tonnes in July, which matched the all-time monthly high, but was up 7.8 percent from a year earlier, the NBS said. On a daily basis, China produced around 91,600 tonnes of primary aluminium last month, the lowest since May, according to Reuters calculations based on the data. Aluminium prices on the Shanghai Futures Exchange climbed 2.1 percent over August, but spot prices for alumina, the substance used to make the metal, rose by 10.8 percent in the key eastern China region SMM-ALM-ECHN over the same period, pressuring smelters. The global alumina market has been tight this year due to an outage at Norsk Hydro’s Alunorte plant in Brazil, U.S. sanctions on Russian producer Rusal and a strike at Alcoa’s alumina refineries in Western Australia. Chinese alumina producers have taken advantage of skyrocketing international alumina prices to make rare big-volume exports of the material, which has reduced availability domestically. Victor You, an analyst at CLSA in Hong Kong, said he had heard of aluminium production cuts being made in central China’s Henan province, which he described as “traditionally a very high-cost place to run aluminium smelters”. “That’s because a lot of the smelters do not have an integrated alumina operation. If they have to source from outside, it is going to be pretty rough for them,” he said. Spot alumina prices in central China SMM-ALM-CCHN are currently at their highest since December. “(Aluminium margins) have been falling sharply, so it wouldn’t surprise me if some curtailments happened,” You added. Over the first eight months of 2018, China produced 22.21 million tonnes of aluminium, up 3.5 percent year-on-year, the NBS data showed on Friday. Output of a group of 10 nonferrous metals - including copper, aluminium, lead, zinc and nickel – rose 5.7 percent year-on-year to 4.54 million tonnes, but was down 1.8 percent from 4.62 million tonnes in July. Output from this group in the first eight months was up 3.8 percent at 35.71 million tonnes. The other non-ferrous metals in the group are tin, antimony, mercury, magnesium and titanium.

2018-09-14,"TOKYO, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Oil on Friday clawed back some of its losses from the previous session when prices fell the most in a month, although worries that emerging market crises and trade disputes could dent demand continued to drag. Brent crude was up 23 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $78.41 a barrel by 0122 GMT, after falling 2 percent on Thursday. The global benchmark the day before rose to its highest since May 22 at $80.13 a barrel. U.S. light crude was up 27 cents, or 0.4 percent, at 68.86, after dropping 2.5 percent on Thursday. The International Energy Agency on Thursday warned that although the oil market was tightening at the moment and world oil demand would reach 100 million barrels per day (bpd) in the next three months, global economic risks were mounting. “As we move into 2019, a possible risk to our forecast lies in some key emerging economies, partly due to currency depreciations versus the U.S. dollar, raising the cost of imported energy,” the agency said. “In addition, there is a risk to growth from an escalation of trade disputes,” the Paris-based agency said. China will not buckle to U.S. demands in any trade negotiations, the major state-run China Daily newspaper said in an editorial on Friday, after Chinese officials welcomed an invitation from Washington for a new round of talks.

Australian shares were up 0.5 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei stock index gained 0.9 percent.

2018-09-14,"KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan’s chemicals-to-energy conglomerate Engro Corp has seen its fortunes rise on the back of massive Chinese investment, but plans to shape its future growth around the country’s vast population and expanding middle class, its chief executive said.     Engro Corp (EGCH.KA), best known for its fertilizer and petrochemicals factories, as well as engineering projects, is Pakistan’s largest listed conglomerate, and after recovering from a brush with bankruptcy in the early part of this decade is now sitting on a $500 million (381.2 million pounds) cash pile.  It has been a major beneficiary from Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative splurge, working with Chinese firms on coal and power projects worth billions of dollars.     Engro’s rising fortunes since 2012, when its factories were crippled by gas shortages, mirror the improvements in Pakistan, a nuclear-armed nation where economic growth has accelerated due to vast Chinese investment and a sharp drop in militancy and power outages.     In the near term, Engro’s outlook is linked to a mile-long $1.5 billion coal mine in the Thar desert near the border with India, part of Beijing’s pledge to invest about $60 billion in Pakistan. But with Pakistan’s new government hinting it may review Belt and Road contracts due to concerns they were too expensive, some analysts see risks on the horizon for Engro and say planned power plants around the mine may struggle to obtain financing. Ghias Khan, Engro’s chief executive, told Reuters this week he was “pretty confident” the government would not re-open deals with sovereign guarantees.     “If they do, that will have a very negative impact,” Khan said. This year Pakistan’s economy has also been shaken by a shortage of dollars, and speculation Islamabad may turn to the International Monetary Fund to ease current account pressures. Undeterred by Chinese investment jitters and the recently wobbly economy, Khan said Engro was weighing acquisitions and starting new businesses in agriculture, healthcare, real estate, communications and other consumer-linked sectors to profit from rising incomes in the Muslim majority country of 208 million people, 60 percent of whom are aged under 30.     “We’ve come to a realization what has gotten Engro where it is today is not good enough for our next phase of growth,” Khan said in an interview at Engro’s ocean-front headquarters in Karachi, an Arabian Sea metropolis.     “What we are proud of is our ability to execute large-scale projects and put up large industrial complexes. But we are mindful we have to get into businesses which are more related to the population growth, and take us closer to the consumers.”          In Karachi, mushrooming shopping malls and ever-rising number of cars on the road point to a multi-year consumer boom as people’s disposable incomes have doubled this decade, analysts say.     Khan compared Pakistan’s current economic level, population growth and per capita income, which stands at about $1,600, to where China, South Korea and India were at earlier points in their development.     “If you look at sectors that did well when they were where Pakistan is today ... like real estate, automobiles, healthcare, logistics - everything is somehow related or linked to  population growth or the middle class,” Khan said.         The company, born out of an employees’ buyout of Exxon’s Pakistan operations in the 1990s, was also looking to go deeper into the petrochemicals sector, and was exploring projects to set up naphtha, ethane crackers or polypropylene facilities in the ports of Karachi or Gwadar, Khan added.      What Engro will do with its cash pile of about 60 billion rupees ($490 million) has been a hot topic in Pakistan’s equity market.     “One thing is very clear: how we invest these 60 billion rupees ... will determine how this organization looks 10-15 years from now,” said Khan, adding a decision would be made “hopefully soon”.     In the meantime, the company is busily expanding its coal projects in Thar, located in the remote deserts of Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital. Helped by Beijing’s cash and Chinese expertise, Engro began digging the Thar mine in 2016 with China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC).  The coal will feed into a 660MW power plant Engro is building, part of about 4,000MW of generation planned by various Pakistani consortiums by 2021. Pakistan says it has the world’s 7th largest coal reserves, but it is of the low-grade lignite variety and for decades successive attempts at large-scale mining have failed.     Analysts say Engro has locked in returns on equity of about 30 percent per annum, in dollar terms and with a sovereign guarantee, on the power projects.     Engro declined to reveal equity returns on power projects, but with Pakistan looking to control its ballooning current account deficit to avoid another IMF bailout, Khan said the new government was likely to want power plants that do not rely on imported fuel.

2018-09-14,"(Repeats with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2p5xq3j By John Kemp LONDON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Oil prices have risen back to levels that earlier this year prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to take to Twitter and demand OPEC do more to bring them down. Front-month Brent futures settled well above $79 per barrel on Wednesday, the highest for over three months, and above levels that have spurred the president to complain in the past (tmsnrt.rs/2p5xq3j). “The OPEC monopoly must remember that gas prices are up and they are doing little to help. If anything, they are driving prices higher as the United States defends many of their members,” the president wrote in July. “REDUCE PRICING NOW!” the president demanded in his trademark all-capitals style when Brent was trading at only $78 per barrel on July 4. The president had already grumbled on June 13, when Brent was over $76, writing “Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!”. And his first intervention came on April 20, when Brent was just $74, tweeting “Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!” The president has repeatedly blamed OPEC for not pumping enough, even as his administration has worked closely with Saudi Arabia to cut off oil exports from Iran. The renewed rise in prices must therefore be increasing the risk the president will complain again and press OPEC - in effect Saudi Arabia, which holds almost all spare capacity - to increase production further. There is some evidence that presidential tweets, as well as private conversations with Saudi policymakers, have influenced the kingdom’s production policy. The president’s tweets between late April and early July coincided with a sharp change in Saudi rhetoric about the state of the oil market and need for more supplies, followed quickly by a ramp up in the kingdom’s production. While some commentators have dismissed the tweets as empty political theatre, they have probably had a real impact on supplies. The president’s interventions, on twitter and behind-the-scenes, are therefore significant for prices, at least in the short and medium term. Oil prices are always politically sensitive in the United States, but especially now, with sanctions on Iran due to be re-imposed on Nov. 4 and congressional elections on Nov. 6. Neither the White House nor Saudi Arabia wants to be blamed for pursuing policies that push up costs for American motorists. The cost of living has already emerged as a minor electoral issue, with an argument about whether faster wage gains are being wiped out by inflation. Presidential tweets are therefore an attempt to shift blame as well as push allies to increase output faster and further than they might otherwise. So the renewed rise in benchmark oil prices is unlikely to be welcomed by the White House, but prices might have headroom to rise by another few dollars before drawing another intervention. As earlier tweets have made clear, the president worries about gasoline prices paid by U.S. motorists rather than the price of crude. Wholesale U.S. gasoline prices are still below levels that prompted tweets earlier this year, at around $85 per barrel, compared with $88 to $92 between late April and early July. The switch from summer grade gasoline, which is more expensive for refiners to produce, to winter grade has helped cut gasoline prices faced by motorists. Gasoline prices have also softened as refiners have processed record volumes of crude during the summer months and gasoline stocks have risen to a record for the time of year. Gasoline futures are currently trading just $6 per barrel above Brent compared with $12-14 at the time of the president’s tweets. While crude prices have already returned to the tweet zone, fuel prices are still a few dollars per barrel below, which may reduce sensitivity for the time being. The United States and Saudi Arabia are fully aligned on the issue of Iran sanctions and senior policymakers from both countries appear to be coordinating closely. Saudi Arabia’s oil minister has been on a high-profile visit to the United States this week including discussions with the U.S. energy secretary. Both countries have a strong interest in the successful introduction of sanctions without causing a politically damaging spike in oil prices. But gasoline prices are already fairly high and most hedge fund managers are now betting they will rise even further in the future. The policy pathway for reducing Iran’s oil exports without creating a spike in fuel prices is narrow and may be difficult to execute in practice. If crude and gasoline prices do continue to rise, the White House may be tempted to release more crude from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve or renew its pressure on Saudi Arabia to increase output even faster, either via public tweet or private conversations.

2018-09-14,"CARACAS/BEIJING (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is travelling to China to discuss economic agreements, as the crisis-struck OPEC nation seeks to convince its key Asian financier to disburse fresh loans. “I am going with great expectations and we will see each other again in a few days with big achievements,” the leftist leader said on Wednesday in a state broadcast from the airport, without providing details. Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. China’s Foreign Ministry said Maduro would visit from Thursday until Sunday at the invitation of President Xi Jinping. “Recently, the Venezuelan president has actively pushed forward economic reforms, and there has been a positive reaction to these from society,” ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing. “I think that a Venezuela that is steadily developing is in everyone’s interests. China has faith that the Venezuelan people and government will be able to handle its domestic affairs with the legal framework,” he added. “This visit by President Maduro is beneficial to both sides’ mutual trust, to push forward cooperation, to expand ties between the two countries and to promote Venezuela’s development.” Chinese state-run newspaper the Global Times said in a Friday editorial that some had claimed Maduro’s government would have collapsed without China’s support. “They clearly underestimate the Maduro government’s capabilities. It should be noted that the government has quite a few supporters and its political foundation is not as vulnerable as the Western media describe,” it said.  Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez is currently in China and on Wednesday met with Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a brief statement late on Wednesday. The two countries have long had friendly ties and cooperation has been “steadily progressing” in all fields, the ministry cited Wang as telling Rodriguez. On Tuesday, Rodriguez met with Zhang Jianhua, president of top state energy firm CNPC. CNPC said on its website that Zhang told Rodriguez, who was also accompanied by a vice president of Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA, that he hopes both sides continue to work harder to deepen cooperation in the oil and gas sectors. The company cited Rodriguez as saying she hopes CNPC can help Venezuela boost output and move the cooperation to a higher level. CNPC is a major investor in oil and gas exploration in Venezuela and also a top lifter of Venezuelan oil under the government-to-government loans for oil deals.  Over a decade, China plowed more than $50 billion into Venezuela through oil-for-loan agreements that helped Beijing secure energy supplies for its fast-growing economy while bolstering an anti-Washington ally in Latin America. The flow of cash halted nearly three years ago, however, when Venezuela asked for a change of payment terms amid falling oil prices and declining crude output that pushed its state-led economy into a hyperinflationary collapse. Venezuela’s finance ministry in July said it would receive $250 million from the China Development Bank to boost oil production but offered no details. Venezuela previously accepted a $5 billion loan from China for its oil sector but has yet to receive the entire amount. Local consultant Asdrubal Oliveros, who tracks Chinese loans closely, said on Wednesday Venezuela was close to clinching a fresh loan of $5 billion to finance oil projects. Beijing was waiting for Maduro to announce a series of economic measures, including a steep devaluation and more flexible currency controls, before extending fresh funds, Oliveros said.

2018-09-14,"(Reuters) - A former manager of a U.S.-based logistics company pleaded guilty on Thursday to paying bribes to secure contracts from Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA, and the guilty plea of the official who was bribed was also unsealed, the U.S. Justice Department said. Juan Carlos Castillo Rincon, 55, pleaded guilty in federal court in Houston to conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Justice Department said in a statement. Judge Nancy K. Johnson also unsealed the guilty plea of Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) official Jose Orlando Camacho, 46, whom Castillo had bribed, it said. Camacho had pleaded under seal to conspiracy to commit money laundering in July 2017, the statement said. It referred to Camacho as a “foreign official” but did not specify the position he held in the company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA [PDVSA.UL]. Fourteen people have now pleaded guilty as part of an investigation by the Justice Department into bribery at PDVSA that became public with the arrest of two Venezuelan businessmen in December 2015. Castillo, of Conroe, Texas, was arrested in Miami in April after he was indicted by a grand jury, the statement said. A manager at a Houston-based logistics and freight forwarding company, Castillo admitted to conspiring with others to bribe Camacho from 2011 through at least 2013 in exchange for help in obtaining contracts and inside information about the company’s bidding process. The Justice Department said that Camacho, of Miami, admitted as part of his plea deal to accepting bribes from Castillo and the company he worked for, as well as conspiring with him to launder proceeds of the scheme. Castillo and Camacho have agreed to forfeit the proceeds from their criminal activity, and both are scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 21, the Justice Department said.
