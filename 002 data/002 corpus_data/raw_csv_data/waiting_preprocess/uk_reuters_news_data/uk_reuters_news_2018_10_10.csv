2018-10-10,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Twenty-two U.S. senators on Wednesday forced a U.S. investigation of whether human rights sanctions should be imposed over the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist last seen as he entered the Saudi consulate in Turkey on Oct. 2. In a letter, the senators said they had triggered a provision of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act requiring the president to determine whether a foreign person is responsible for a gross human rights violation. “Our expectation is that in making your determination you will consider any relevant information, including with respect to the highest ranking officials in the Government of Saudi Arabia,” they said. The Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senators Bob Corker and Bob Menendez, and their counterparts on the Appropriations subcommittee that funds the State Department, Lindsey Graham and Patrick Leahy, triggered the Magnitsky action. But the 18 others also signed the letter to send Trump a strong bipartisan message of support for a serious U.S. response to Khashoggi’s disappearance, Senate aides said. The Global Magnitsky Act requires a report within 120 days of the letter with a decision on the imposition of sanctions on anyone deemed responsible for a serious rights violation such as torture, prolonged detention without trial or extrajudicial killing of someone exercising freedom of expression. “The recent disappearance of Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi suggests that he could be a victim of a gross violation of international recognised human rights,” the letter said. The 2012 Magnitsky Act imposed visa bans and asset freezes on Russian officials linked to the 2009 death in prison of Sergei Magnitsky, a 37-year-old Russian whistleblower. It became the Global Magnitsky Act in 2016 when it was expanded to cover rights abusers in any country.

2018-10-10,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices dropped 2 percent on Wednesday as U.S. equity markets broadly fell, even though energy traders worried about shrinking Iranian supply from U.S. sanctions and kept an eye on Hurricane Michael, which closed some U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil output. Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell $1.91, or 2.3 percent, to settle at $83.09 a barrel. The global benchmark posted a 1.3 percent gain on Tuesday.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell $1.79 to settle at $73.17 a barrel, a 2.4 percent loss.  Oil prices extended losses in post-settlement trade when industry group the American Petroleum Institute reported that crude inventories rose by 9.7 million barrels in the week to Oct. 5 to 410.7 million, more than four times the 2.6 million barrel build analysts had expected. The U.S. Energy Information Administration is due to release official government inventory data Thursday at 11 a.m. EDT. Oil prices fell as U.S. stock markets skidded on Wednesday, with the S&P500 stock index marking its biggest one-day fall since February. Rising U.S. Treasury yields and trade policy worries sparked the sell-off on Wall Street. “As long as we continue to see broad-based weakness in the equity sector, that’s going to start spilling over into other areas as well. One in particular will be energy because it’s all about economic expectations,” said Brian LaRose, a technical analyst at United-ICAP. Risks to the global financial system have risen over the past six months and could increase sharply if pressures in emerging markets escalate or global trade relations deteriorate further, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said. On Tuesday, the IMF cut its global economic growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019, raising concerns that demand for oil may also slump. Prices fell despite worries about supply as Hurricane Michael made landfall in Florida. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, producers have cut daily oil production by roughly 42 percent due to the storm, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said. The cuts represent 718,877 barrels per day of oil production. While crude output has been cut because of the hurricane, “down time is expected to be brief and Gulf of Mexico output now accounts for a comparatively small portion of total U.S. production,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. Worries about crude supply from the Middle East have given prices some support.  Iran’s crude exports fell further in early October as buyers sought alternatives ahead of U.S. sanctions that take effect on Nov. 4, according to tanker data and an industry source. Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, will supply Indian buyers with an additional 4 million barrels of crude oil in November, several sources familiar with the matter said. India is Iran’s top oil client after China. Several of the world’s biggest trading houses expect U.S. sanctions on Iran to keep oil prices high, with crude staying above $65 and possibly breaking above $100 in the medium term. U.S. crude oil output this year was expected to rise 1.39 million bpd to a record 10.74 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its monthly forecast on Wednesday.

2018-10-10,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks on major world markets slid to a three-month low on Wednesday, with the benchmark S&P500 stock index falling more than 3.0 percent, its biggest one-day fall since February. Technology shares tumbled on fears of slowing demand, while bond yields ended lower after seeing multi-year highs earlier this week.   Major equity indexes in Europe fell more than 1.0 percent, also pulled down by technology shares, and gold prices inched up as some investors sought refuge in the metal. “The S&P 500 is looking very weak and negative and that is putting fear into investors,” said Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors. “With the markets going down people are increasing their allocation towards gold.” On Wall Street, the Philadelphia Semiconductor index tumbled 4.46 percent after Swiss vacuum valve maker VAT Group said demand was softening from chip equipment makers. Among the tech sector’s worst performers in Europe,  Austrian chipmaker AMS fell 5.9 percent and STMicroelectronics closed down 5.8 percent. Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury notes rose late in the day, pushing yields down to 3.1931 percent. Yields on 3-year notes have recently traded just above 3.0 percent, providing long-absent competition for investment returns with  equities.  The rise in U.S. Treasury yields has been bolstered by good  U.S. economic data that has reinforced expectations of multiple rate hikes over the next 12 months by the Federal Reserve. Stocks and bonds traditionally have been in a tug of war for capital, but for the past 10 years bonds have had one arm tied behind their back, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer and founding partner at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. “Short-term bonds are getting to be a compelling place to hang out,” he said. “This orphan status that equity markets have enjoyed for the last 10 years is disappearing and finally getting some competition from the bond market.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 831.83 points, or 2.2 percent, to 25,598.74. The S&P 500 lost 94.66 points, or 3.29 percent, to 2,785.68 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 315.97 points, or 4.08 percent, to 7,422.05. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe fell  percent, its biggest single-day fall since February. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed down 1.57 percent. The euro and sterling rose, underpinned by optimism for a Brexit deal, while the U.S. dollar lost ground against a basket of currencies even as U.S. yields hovered near multiyear peaks. European Union Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier signaled progress on a deal with the UK over its withdrawal from the bloc. “There is more optimism that they will find some agreement between Britain and the European Union before Brexit,” said Steve Englander, global head of G10 FX research at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. The dollar index fell 0.17 percent, with the euro up 0.25 percent to $1.1518. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.53 percent versus the greenback at 112.36.

2018-10-10,"(Adds status of energy pipelines) HOUSTON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Hurricane Michael on Wednesday cut 42 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico daily crude oil production and nearly a third of natural gas output, the largest reductions in a year, after companies evacuated staff and shut-in platforms as a precaution. Michael slammed into the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday as a fast-moving, Category 4 storm bringing heavy rains and winds of 155 miles per hour (249 kph) to the U.S. southeast. Companies turned off daily production of 718,877 barrels of oil and 812 million cubic feet of natural gas by midday on Wednesday, according to the federal offshore regulator, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE). Despite the fall in output, U.S. crude futures settled down more than 2 percent at $73.17 per barrel on Wednesday, tracking the weaker U.S. stock market and reflecting the declining importance of Gulf of Mexico output due to burgeoning growth from onshore shale fields. Wednesday’s cuts represent about 6.5 percent of the nation’s daily output of 11.1 million barrels of crude. It is the most since Hurricane Nate a year ago curtailed more than 90 percent of Gulf oil production. Total crude output lost in the last three days from shut-ins amounted to 1.7 million barrels, according to BSEE data. It can take several days after a storm passes to restaff and check equipment before production can resume. Oil producers including Anadarko Petroleum Corp, BHP Billiton, BP, Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp evacuated workers from 89 Gulf production platforms before the storm entered the Gulf. Kinder Morgan Inc, North America’s second largest energy pipeline operators, said its fuel and natural gas lines serving the Southeast were unaffected. Construction at its Elba Island, Georgia, liquefied natural gas (LNG) project will be suspended on Thursday and resume once the storm passes. U.S. Gulf Coast oil refineries were not in the path of the storm and continued to operate. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port LLC, the only port in the United States capable of fully loading and unloading supertankers, halted operations at its marine terminal. A week ago, drillers were pulling about 3.4 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of natural gas from offshore Gulf of Mexico wells. On Tuesday, that was down to just 2.2 bcfd, according to data from Refinitiv. Southern Co, the biggest power company in Georgia and Alabama, on Wednesday reduced power in two units at the Farley nuclear power plant in Alabama as a precautionary measure. The reduced operating level will allow personnel to continue monitoring the storm’s progress and if necessary shut the 1,751-megawatt Farley plant, which is about 90 miles (145 km) north of the coast. More than 162,000 customers in Florida, Georgia and Alabama were without power on Wednesday, according to local power companies, and the outages were expected to rise as the storm moved farther inland.

2018-10-10,"PANACEA, Fla. (Reuters) - For Mary Grasberger, even the threat of the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle in recorded history could not persuade her to leave her pets and evacuate the Lighthouse Motel, her home in the beach town of Panacea for the last four years.  “We have nowhere to go,” said Grasberger, 50, who lives in the motel with her 30-year-old daughter, Brenda, and their dogs and cats. “We have animals so we’re not leaving without them.” The motel where they live with the help of government assistance is about 70 miles east of Mexico Beach, where Hurricane Michael crashed into the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday with 155 miles per hour (249 kph) winds and the potential for a devastating storm surge. The tempest was expected to be the worst hurricane ever recorded in Florida. About two hours before it made landfall, Wakulla County sheriff’s deputies arrived at the 26-room Lighthouse and urged the residents, most of whom depend on disability checks and social welfare, to flee. “You’ll be dead. You really need to leave,” one officer told residents, many of whom had no intention of obeying what authorities termed a “mandatory” evacuation order ahead of what officials are describing as a “monstrous” storm.  “We’re leaving in 10 minutes so you need to get out.”  The deputies asked why residents had not heeded earlier warnings and taken a bus that they said came around on Tuesday to give them a ride to safety.  Residents said they knew nothing about a bus. By Wednesday, with the storm just hours away, there was no transportation available. Frustrated, the deputies said they would try to arrange for a van as landfall approached. Like Grasberger, Rachel Ellison, 52, has lived at the motel for about six years and planned to stay put even if there was a way out. She said she had weathered other storms and could ride this one out, too. “I’ve been through this before,” she said. “I have water and everything I need.” Ellison said that based on past hurricanes she did not expect Michael to present any real danger despite the warnings. “It never got bad during previous storms,” she said. “The water never comes up. I mean I’m not worried about it ‘cause it don’t ever come up this high.”   The modest motel, a one-story beige structure that forms a rectangle, stands only about 200 yards from Dickerson Bay, an arm of the Gulf of Mexico, about 30 miles south of the state capital, Tallahassee. Next door is the Panacea Mission Outreach Center, painted bright pink and adorned with painted palm trees. Lenore Adams, 59, who has lived at Lighthouse for seven years, was one of the residents who heeded the officers’ advice. She packed her belongings and got into a friend’s pickup truck with her 17-year-old dog. “He’s been through a lot of storms,” said Adams, before driving off.

2018-10-10,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela on Wednesday increased wages for workers at state energy company PDVSA after employees staged small protests to decry meager salaries amid the OPEC nation’s economic meltdown.  Socialist President Nicolas Maduro in August unexpectedly ordered a 60-fold increase in the minimum wage to compensate for around 500,000 percent annual inflation and a 96 percent devaluation of the bolivar currency.  But workers at PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] said their wages had not been bumped up accordingly, and that the cash-starved company had instead been paying one-off bonuses.  Vice-President Delcy Rodriguez, flanked by pro-government union leaders, on Wednesday announced new wages but did not provide specific figures, instead praising PDVSA’s attitude in the face of U.S. sanctions.  “To the PDVSA workers, our gratitude, because they have been a fundamental pillar in the defense of the oil industry against attacks from imperialist centers of power,” said Rodriguez, a key Maduro ally.  A PDVSA worker and two former employees said the new wages remained inadequate and would not halt a brain drain that has the company desperate for engineers and chemists just as its production sinks to its lowest in decades.  According to an unofficial summary of the new salaries circulated by PDVSA workers, the lowest monthly salary is now 1,800 bolivars - the official minimum wage - or just $13.70 a month. The highest salary, for executives, was put at 6,400 bolivars, a whisker above $49 a month.  PDVSA did not respond to a request for information about the salaries.  Thousands of oil workers are fleeing the state-run firm under the watch of its new military management, which has quickly alienated the firm’s embattled upper echelon and its rank-and-file, sources have told Reuters. Those who remain are increasingly unmotivated, irate over low wages, and fearful of work accidents as PDVSA’s installations deteriorate due to years of underinvestment and mismanagement.  “There is a lot of anger, and at the same time motivation, because workers have woken up and are not putting up with this anymore,” one refinery worker said this week.  Still, fears of dismissal and heavy military presence at PDVSA have kept protests in check in Venezuela, home to the world’s biggest crude reserves.

2018-10-10,"(Reuters) - Most U.S. households should expect higher heating costs this winter (October through March) compared with last winter, according to the federal government’s Winter Fuels Outlook, which will be released in full at 11:00 a.m. (1500 GMT) on Wednesday. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in a summary of the report that the increased costs are mainly the result of higher prices for heating fuels since temperatures are expected to be similar to last winter in much of the country. The EIA said it based its heating demand projections on the most recent temperature forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NOAA’s forecast anticipates the 2018–2019 winter will be 1 percent colder than last winter, which is close to the average of the previous 10 winters. Expenditures for Midwest households using propane as their primary heating source are expected to decline because the Midwest, the region with the highest concentration of propane heating, is the only region expected to have warmer weather this winter, EIA said. Natural gas is the most common space heating fuel in every U.S. region except the South, where electric heating is more prevalent. Heating oil is much more common in the Northeast than in other regions, while propane is more common in the Midwest.

2018-10-10,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel endorsed a hard-fought EU compromise deal for a 35 percent cut in car emissions by 2030, despite protests from her country’s own automakers, which said the target was unrealistic and pursuing it would cost jobs. Torn between reducing pollution and preserving industry competitiveness, EU environment ministers in Luxembourg talked for more than 13 hours on Tuesday to reach a compromise over what 2030 carbon dioxide limits to impose on Europe’s powerful car manufacturers. Asked on Wednesday at a Berlin news conference for her view on the deal, Merkel described the cuts - softer than those demanded by some EU countries - as “defensible”, partly because of the scope for later revising them. “(There is) a revisions clause for 2021, since the question of how fast we can cut carbon dioxide emissions depends on the extent of market penetration by electric cars or other cars with alternative propulsion systems,” she said. “Under these circumstances I think the agreement is wholly defensible.” The EU talks were lent added urgency by the publication of a U.N. report this week warning that time was running short for the rapid and unprecedented global action needed to contain global warming. The car emissions target was harsher than the 30 percent cut wanted by Germany, with its vast auto industry, and the EU’s executive, but short of the 40 percent some other member states were seeking. While Merkel said the agreement at least provided certainty to European carmakers, the industry’s umbrella group protested at the pace of the cuts envisaged and called for more public support for the transition to electric vehicles. “It’s very regrettable that a majority of EU member states didn’t find it in themselves to strike a balance between climate protection and preserving jobs,” said Bernhard Mattes, head of the VDA auto industry umbrella group. EU governments need to take on more of the financial burden of building out networks of charging stations if they want swifter adoption of low-pollution electric cars, he added. Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) chief executive Herbert Diess warned in a German newspaper interview that the planned environmental regulations could have dire consequences.  “An industry can collapse faster than many believe,” Diess told the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Wednesday. A 40 percent cut in car emissions by 2030 would result in the loss of about a quarter of VW’s factory jobs, or 100,000 positions, he said. The 35 percent reduction “doesn’t look much better”, he added. In an indication of the depths of divisions in environmentally-minded Germany over the role of its most important export industry, the toughened targets brought home from Luxembourg failed to win over the opposition. “A 35 percent cut is nothing like enough for the challenges of tomorrow,” said Greens leader Anton Hofreiter. “The government must take its foot off the brake in climate matters.” Reporting by Michelle Martin and Edward Taylor; additional reporting by Tom Sims; Editing by Louise Heavens and Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/eu-autos-emissions-germany/update-2-germany-backs-eu-climate-deal-over-car-lobbys-protests-idUKL8N1WQ3TP,10 Oct 2018,"* VW CEO criticizes regulation in interview with German

2018-10-10,"(Adds details on output forecast, demand forecast) By Jessica Resnick-Ault NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil output in 2018 is expected to grow more quickly than previously forecast to a record high, according to a monthly U.S. government forecast on Wednesday. Crude production was expected to rise 1.39 million barrels per day to 10.74 million bpd this year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its Short Term Energy Outlook (STEO). Last month, the agency expected crude output to rise 1.31 million bpd to 10.66 million bpd in the year. U.S. production has soared, boosted by technological advances that have enabled drillers to tap shale formations, with output this year forecast to overtake the previous annual record of 9.6 million bpd in 1970. In 2017, the U.S. produced 9.4 million bpd. Production is expected to average 11.03 million bpd in the third quarter of this year. If the forecast is accurate, it will be the first quarter on record with U.S. production above 11 million bpd. The agency also expected production in 2019 to grow more quickly than previously forecast, rising 1.02 million bpd to 11.76 million bpd, compared with growth of 840,000 bpd to 11.50 million bpd in last month’s forecast. The agency slightly cut its forecasts for demand growth in 2018 and 2019. The EIA now forecasts U.S. oil demand will rise 450,000 bpd to 20.41 million bpd in 2018, compared with 470,000 bpd previously. Oil consumption will then rise another 230,000 bpd in 2019 to 20.64 million bpd, compared with 250,000 bpd previously.

Brent crude futures fell $1.73 to $83.27 a barrel, a 2 percent loss, by 12:12 p.m. EDT (1612 GMT). The global benchmark posted a 1.3 percent gain on Tuesday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell $1.77 to $73.19 a barrel, a 2.4 percent loss. U.S. stocks markets skidded, weighing on oil prices. Crude futures at times track with equity markets. “As long as we continue to see broad-based weakness in the equity sector, that’s going to start spilling over into other areas as well. One in particular will be energy because it’s all about economic expectations,” said Brian LaRose, a technical analyst at United-ICAP. Risks to the global financial system have risen over the past six months and could increase sharply if pressures in emerging markets escalate or global trade relations deteriorate further, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said. On Tuesday, the IMF cut its global economic growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019, raising concerns that demand for oil may also slump. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, nearly 40 percent of daily crude production was cut on Tuesday because of offshore platform evacuations and shut-ins ahead of Hurricane Michael. Michael has strengthened into a “potentially catastrophic” Category 4 hurricane, according to an advisory from the U.S. National Hurricane Center. Oil producers evacuated personnel from 75 platforms as the storm made its way through the central Gulf on the way to landfall on Wednesday in Florida. Companies had turned off daily production of about 670,800 barrels of oil by midday on Tuesday, according to offshore regulator the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. Worries about crude supply from the Middle East also have given prices some support. Iran’s crude exports fell further in early October as buyers sought alternatives ahead of U.S. sanctions that take effect on Nov. 4, according to tanker data and an industry source. Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, will supply Indian buyers with an additional 4 million barrels of crude oil in November, several sources familiar with the matter said. India is Iran’s top oil client after China. Several of the world’s biggest trading houses expect U.S. sanctions on Iran to keep oil prices high, with crude staying above $65 and possibly breaking above $100 in the medium term. U.S. crude output is expected to rise more than previously forecast in 2018, growing 1.39 million barrels per day to 10.74 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report Wednesday.

On Wall Street, the Philadelphia Semiconductor index tumbled 3.07 percent after Swiss vacuum valve maker VAT Group said demand was softening from chip equipment makers. Among the tech sector’s worst performers in Europe were Austrian chipmaker AMS fell 6.6 percent and STMicroelectronics was down 5.6 percent. Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury notes fell 3/32 in price to push their yield up to 3.2196 percent. But the yield on shorter-term 2-year and 3-year notes was just under or hovered at 3 percent, respectively, providing long-absent competition for equities. The rise in U.S. Treasury yields has been bolstered by solid U.S. economic data that has reinforced expectations of multiple rate hikes over the next 12 months by the Federal Reserve. The fiscal and monetary policy signals for higher rates have been unambiguous, said Mike Terwilliger, portfolio manager of Resource Liquid Alternatives for the Resource Credit Income Fund in New York. “Investors missing this rate move is tantamount to letting yourself get run over by a glacier,” Terwilliger said. Traditionally stocks and bonds have been in a tug of war for capital and for the last 10 years bonds have pulling on that rope with one arm tied behind their back, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer and founding partner at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. “Short-term bonds are getting to be a compelling place to hang out,” he said. “This orphan status that equity markets have enjoyed for the last 10 years is disappearing and finally get some competition from the bond market.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 400.44 points, or 1.52 percent, to 26,030.13. The S&P 500 lost 43.98 points, or 1.53 percent, to 2,836.36 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 169.06 points, or 2.18 percent, to 7,568.96. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.15 percent and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares lost 1.43 percent. The euro and sterling rose, underpinned by optimism for a Brexit deal, while the dollar lost ground against a basket of currencies even as U.S. yields posted fresh multiyear peaks. European Union Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier signaled progress on a deal with the UK over its withdrawal from the bloc. “There is more optimism that they will find some agreement between Britain and the European Union before Brexit,” said Steve Englander, global head of G10 FX research at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. The dollar index fell 0.24 percent, with the euro up 0.35 percent at $1.1529. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.24 percent versus the greenback at 112.67. Oil prices eased after the IMF lowered its global economic growth forecasts, but markets were supported as Hurricane Michael closed nearly 40 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil output and U.S. sanctions restricted Iranian exports.

2018-10-10,"(Adds details, background) By Lefteris Karagiannopoulos OSLO, Oct 10 (Reuters) - A Finnish-Russian consortium’s plan to build a nuclear reactor in western Finland by 2024 is likely to be delayed as more time is needed to secure licenses, its chairman said on Wednesday. The Fennovoima consortium includes Russia’s state nuclear company Rosatom, whose involvement has raised concerns in Finland about Russia’s influence in the country. The Finnish parliament, however, approved the project to build the 1.2 gigawatt (GW) reactor, which is expected to cost 6.5 billion-7 billion euros ($7.5 billion-$8 billion), to boost domestic energy production. “Normally when a plane departs late it arrives late. 2024 would be extremely ambitious if not unrealistic,” the consortium’s chairman, Esa Harmala, told Reuters. The consortium also includes Finnish power company Fortum and stainless steel maker Outokumpu, among other companies. Finland’s nuclear regulator STUK said last week it would make a decision on a license to start construction of the reactor, named Hanhikivi 1, in 2020, pending the provision of documents from its owners, including Rosatom. The Fennovoima consortium said last year it would submit the documents in 2018 and that it expected to get a permit in 2019, a year later than originally planned. STUK said last week that the consortium informed it in August that the documents would be submitted by July 2019. Harmala also said he expected that the documents would be supplied by summer next year, as more information is required from Rosatom. That means the consortium may not get STUK approval until 2020 and would struggle to meet its target to start the plant in 2024. “We are still discussing with the supplier (Rosatom). By the end of this year we will get an updated timetable on the schedule,” said Harmala. A spokesman for Rosatom, which holds a 34 percent stake in Fenovoima consortium, said  that “as of now” there has been no change on the planed startup date agreed by its members. Rosatom, which has been stepping up an overseas expansion, agreed in 2013 to take the stake in the project, and to supply the reactor. A Finnish project to build another nuclear power plant in Finland, Olkiluoto 3, is already more than a decade behind schedule, and may face further postponements, plant operator Teollisuuden Voima (TVO) said on last week.

2018-10-10,"ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan has agreed to increase releases of water from a dam in southeastern Turkey to neighbouring Iraq, which is struggling with a water crisis, the speaker of the Iraqi parliament said on Wednesday.    Turkey is holding back water on the Tigris river to fill a reservoir behind its Ilisu dam, a step that has alarmed Iraq and caused shortages particularly in the southern province of Basra. Speaker Mohammed al-Halbousi, who met Erdogan in Turkey on Tuesday, said the president had agreed to an Iraqi request for more supplies. This was “in order to guarantee water reaches all of Iraq’s provinces, especially Basra”, Halbousi said in a statement. Turkey temporarily stopped filling the reservoir in June but agreed with Iraq to resume doing so in July. Around 70 percent of Iraq’s water supplies flow from neighbouring countries, especially in the Tigris and Euphrates which run through Turkey. Iraq’s water shortages have led it to take measures such as bans on rice planting, and driven farmers to leave their land. Basra province has seen months of street protests over the lack of clean drinking water. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu is due in Baghdad on Thursday.

2018-10-10,"(Changes dateline) SARAJEVO, Bosnia/SLAVONSKI BROD, Croatia, Oct 10 (Reuters) - T he powerful blast that rocked Bosnia’s Brod oil refinery late on Tuesday has left one worker dead, officials said as they raised the figure for the number injured to nine. Firefighters put down the blaze at the plant’s oil and gas processing unit shortly after midnight and rescuers later discovered one body inside the facility, said Brod’s mayor, Ilija Jovicic on Wednesday. Of the nine people injured, four were in seriously condition. Previous reports said eight people were injured in the blast. Jovicic said the refinery has continued to operate since the explosion, adding that an investigation which was still underway should establish the cause of the explosion. The Brod refinery, which processes 1.2 million tonnes of crude a year, is majority owned by Russia’s Neftegazinkor, a unit of state-owned oil company Zarubezhneft. Auditors have previously warned that it may face liquidity problems after it piled up losses and its liabilities exceeded assets. The company, however, has dismissed those claims. Residents of nearby Slavonski Brod, just across the border in Croatia, have complained about rising pollution levels from the refinery for years and Bosnian and Croatian authorities have been working to combat this issue. Air quality measures showed no major spike in pollution levels on Wednesday, Jovicic said. Officials from Croatia and Russia, including the head of Zarubezhneft, met on Wednesday in Slavonski Brod to talk about providing gas from Croatia to the Brod refinery, in an effort to reduce air pollution. “I believe that by the end of 2019 we could have the Brod refinery operating on gas supply from Croatia. At the moment we’re working on defining commercial terms of the arrangement,” Croatia’s Energy Minister Tomislav Coric said after the meeting.

2018-10-10,"(Reuters) - Nearly 40 percent of daily crude oil production and more than one-third of natural gas output was lost from offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico wells on Wednesday because of platform evacuations and shut-ins ahead of Hurricane Michael. Michael is a Category 4 storm expected to hit the Florida Panhandle later Wednesday with maximum sustained winds of 145 miles (233 kilometers) per hour. Oil producers - including Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N), BHP Billiton BLT.L, BP (BP.L) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N) - have since Monday evacuated personnel from 75 platforms as the storm made its way through the central Gulf.  The country’s largest privately owned crude terminal, the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port LLC, said on Tuesday it had halted operations at its marine terminal. The facility is the only port in the United States capable of fully loading and unloading a tanker with a capacity of 2 million barrels of oil.  Companies turned off daily production of about 670,800 barrels of oil and 726 million cubic feet of gas by midday on Tuesday, according to the federal offshore regulator, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE).  The evacuations affected about 11 percent of the occupied platforms in the Gulf, it said. A week ago, drillers were pulling about 3.4 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas out of the offshore Gulf of Mexico. On Tuesday, that was down to just 2.2 bcfd, according to data from Refinitiv. Southern Co (SO.N), the biggest power company in Georgia and Alabama, said all of its nuclear power plants were operating at or near full power early Wednesday. Southern said it was waiting for the latest weather reports before deciding whether to shut the 1,751-megawatt Farley plant in southern Alabama. Farley is the company’s reactor closest to where Hurricane Michael is expected to make landfall. U.S. crude futures CLc1 were trading down over 1 percent at $74.14 per barrel Wednesday morning, reflecting the declining importance of Gulf of Mexico output that has resulted from the growth of production from the nation’s onshore shale fields.  Crude output lost in the two days of storm shut-ins represents about 9 percent of the U.S. production of 11.1 million barrels per day, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.  In addition to shutting in wells, oil producers halted most offshore drilling operations by evacuating three drilling rigs and moving eight others out of the storm area, BSEE said.

2018-10-10,"PARIS (Reuters) - French state-owned utility EDF (EDF.PA) plans to become the leader in electric vehicle charging in Europe, a potentially lucrative, but already crowded, sector. Power utilities, tech start-ups and oil majors are all fighting to establish themselves as the dominant players in the  fast-growing business. reut.rs/2ONEaBb reut.rs/2Ec1RPI EDF Chief Executive Jean-Bernard Levy said the company was targeting a 30 percent market share in electric vehicle charging in France, Belgium, Italy and the United Kingdom, aiming to supply power for 600,000 electric vehicles by 2022.  “We want to become the uncontested leader in electric mobility in Europe by 2022,” Levy told reporters. EDF estimates that electric vehicles (EV) will make up 30 percent of all new cars sold in its four core European markets by 2030, or at the latest by 2035.  Via its Sodetrel unit, the company aims to deploy 75,000 EV charging stations in Europe by 2022 and give its European customers access to 250,000 terminals operated by other providers. Sodetrel already operates 5,000 charging stations in France and provides access to 60,000 charging points in Europe. Levy declined to specify how much EDF will invest in the electric mobility drive or how much revenue it hopes to derive from it. A year ago, Sodetrel said it had seen annual revenue growth of 50 percent over the past three years.  Sodetrel operates public charging networks in Paris, Marseille and Grenoble as well as in regions in northern France. It also operates charging stations for car park operator Indigo, and in car parks for retailers IKEA and Auchan and Paris airports company ADP, among others. The electric vehicle plan is Levy’s third big renewable energy investment, following a 25 billion euro ($29 billion) push into solar power announced in December 2017 and an eight billion euro investment in power storage in March. Some of EDF’s competitors, such as Engie (ENGIE.PA) and several German and Scandinavian utilities, made EV charging a key part of their strategy well before the French group, but Levy rejected the idea that EDF was late to the game.  “I like to think that we are early, in fact. At any rate, what matters in a race is not where you are at the starting line, but where you are at the finish line,” he said. EDF said it had alliances with several EV charging specialists, including Californa-based Nuvve, which aggregates power from EV batteries while they are parked, and Germany’s Ubitricity, which converts streetlights into charging points. It also has technology and research alliances with car makers Renault (RENA.PA) and Toyota (6201.T) and car parts maker Valeo (VLOF.PA).

2018-10-10,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany should fine carmakers if they fail to fix dirty diesel vehicles, a senior member of the Social Democrat (SPD) coalition party said on Wednesday, accusing the transport minister of being too close to the auto industry. “The kid gloves need to come off,” said Carsten Schneider, a senior figure in the center-left SPD’s parliamentary group, adding that carmakers could be fined up to 5,000 euros  ($5,7600) per vehicle if they did not carry out remedial work on older diesel cars. The German government last week outlined plans to cut pollution from diesels by asking carmakers to offer owners trade-in incentives and hardware fixes in an attempt to avert further driving bans in major cities. But its efforts were dealt a blow by a Berlin court ruling on Tuesday that ordered Germany’s capital to ban older diesel vehicles from some of its roads. The comments from Schneider highlighted strains between parties in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition over the issue. Schneider said he had doubts whether Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer, a member of Merkel’s conservative allies from Bavaria, was treating the issue with the necessary urgency. “The transport minister should not behave as though he was the country’s chief car salesman but rather like someone who represents the interests of those who have bought diesel cars,” he said. Merkel on Wednesday endorsed a hard-fought EU compromise deal for a 35 percent cut in carbon dioxide emissions from cars by 2030, despite protests from her country’s own carmakers, who said the target was unrealistic and that pursuing it would cost jobs. There has been disagreement within the German government on balancing demands to make carmakers pay for the cost of reducing pollution in the wake of an emissions scandal and calls to protect the auto industry, the country’s biggest exporter. While the SPD has called for binding measures to make carmakers fix older diesels, Merkel’s conservatives favor a softer solution, offering car owners a discount if they wish to trade in their diesel cars for new ones.

2018-10-10,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2OhOLFi By John Kemp LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - El Niño conditions are developing across the Pacific Ocean, with meteorologists now putting the probability of a full event developing by the end of the year at almost 75 percent. Sea surface temperatures are warming counter-seasonally across much of the equatorial Pacific and trade winds are slackening, both common precursors of an El Niño episode. The principal impacts of El Niño (and its opposite weather pattern La Niña) are felt in Southeast Asia, Australia and South America, where it can have a major effect on temperatures and rainfall, with a big effect on agriculture. The impacts on North America are more complicated and variable, but it has an effect on both total heating demand and its regional distribution in the winter months. El Niño conditions alter the position of the polar jet stream, typically bringing warmer temperatures to Canada and the northern United States during the northern hemisphere winter from December to February. But El Niño also results in a stronger and more persistent Pacific jet stream into the southwestern United States, bringing more rain, snow, storms and cooler temperatures to California and other southern states. As the ocean warms, government forecasters in the United States and Australia estimate there is now triple the normal chance of El Niño occurring this winter, though it is likely to be a relatively weak episode. El Niño is one aspect of the enormous ocean-atmosphere circulations that transport heat across the equatorial Pacific, a set of complex interactions known formally as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In the oceanic circulation, cool water wells up from the deep sea off the coast of Peru and is transported west across the Pacific on the equatorial current towards the maritime continent of Southeast Asia. The water is gradually warmed by the wind and sun ultimately forming a pool of very warm water off the coast of Indonesia. There is a return flow of warm water east to South America on the equatorial counter currents and in a deep current below the surface of the ocean, closing the loop. At the same time, warm water around the maritime continent causes tremendous evaporation and a column of warm moist air to rise high into the atmosphere, which then flows east across the Pacific. The air cools and dries, eventually sinking off the coast of South America, before returning towards Asia in a steady westward flow near the surface known to mariners as the trade winds. The oceanic and atmospheric circulations tend to reinforce one another, with the trade winds driving the equatorial currents, and sea surface temperature differentials reinforcing the rising and falling air columns. But the strength of the circulations and the degree of coupling between them varies at seasonal, annual and inter-annual time scales (El Nino, La Nina and the Southern Oscillation”, Philander, 1990). El Niño occurs when both circulations are weak, trade winds are slack, less cold water is welling up off the coast of Peru, and less cold water is being carried west into the central Pacific. La Niña, the opposite of El Niño, occurs when circulations are at their strongest, with strong trade winds, more upwelling and more cold water carried further into the central ocean. The entire ocean-atmosphere system cycles irregularly between weak, warm El Niño and strong, cool La Niña phases, but the frequency and strength of the phases is highly variable. As a rule, however, El Niño and La Niña effects tend to be weakest during the first quarter of the year, strengthening in the second and third quarters, and peaking in the fourth. Forecasts therefore tend to be relatively uncertain and subject to large errors early in the year but become more accurate towards the end of the third quarter and early in the fourth. For most of this year, sea surface temperatures in the central-eastern Pacific have been warming but remained close to their long-term seasonal average, sending a relatively ambiguous signal (tmsnrt.rs/2OhOLFi). In recent weeks, however, sea surface temperatures in the central ocean have become much warmer than average for the time of year, sending a clearer sign that El Niño might be developing. The trade winds across the equatorial Pacific have also been weakening, which should promote further sea surface warming in the weeks ahead and intensify the formation of El Niño conditions. Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology upgraded its previous El Niño Watch to an El Niño Alert on Oct. 9, warning that El Niño was now three times more likely than normal to occur before the end of the year. The Climate Prediction Center, part of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, estimates there is an almost 75 percent chance of El Niño conditions prevailing between December and February. El Niño’s impact is felt most strongly around the Pacific and Indian oceans, and becomes fainter further away, where the effects are more likely to be masked by other oceanic and atmospheric developments. The weather impacts also depend critically on the strength of the El Niño, in other words how much warmer the Pacific becomes compared with the long-term average. Strong or very strong El Niño episodes, where sea surface temperatures are 1.5 degrees or 2.0 degrees centigrade above the long-term average, will produce a pronounced and readily observable impact on the weather. A weak El Niño, where sea surface temperatures average just 0.5-0.9 degrees centigrade above the seasonal average, has much less impact on weather patterns and can easily be masked by other developments. The strength of El Niño is harder to forecast accurately, but episodes that develop relatively late in the year, such as this one, tend to be weaker than those which start to develop earlier. The U.S. government is currently forecasting central Pacific surface temperatures will be 0.8 degrees warmer than average between December and February, which would produce a relatively weak El Niño this winter and only moderate impacts on the United States.

2018-10-10,"LONDON (Reuters) - Governments not energy firms need to take the lead in achieve U.N. targets to contain global warming, with policies that will change fuel and other energy consumption habits, oil and gas companies said. A U.N. panel called this week for “unprecedented” changes in how the world consumes energy and a dramatic rise in the use of renewable power to contain global warming at lower levels and protect the planet from heatwaves, floods and rising sea levels. “Clearly it’s a call to action,” BP Chief Executive Dudley told an Oil & Money conference in London this week.  “Not only oil and gas companies, but you need that in agriculture, you need that in steel production, you need that in the use of people pushing the button on the wall to get electricity,” he said. Several oil and gas firms are among those taking steps to contain emissions of some greenhouse gases. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS), BP (BP.L) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) have all set targets to reduce methane emissions. “Let’s stop quibbling in society about whose fault it is and who should do more,” Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said. To contain the rise in global temperatures at 1.5 degrees Celsius, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPC) said manmade global net carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions would need to fall by about 45 percent by 2030 from 2010 levels. It said emissions should be “net zero” by mid-century. Van Beurden said that, while such a target could be met, “it would not be commercially viable under today’s regulations and policies and market designs, so things would have to change.” BP’s Dudley said more industry collaboration would help, saying cooperation between the energy industry and carmakers was helping achieve greater fuel efficiency and reducing emissions. “We can do this even faster and more efficiently I think with clearer, smarter policy signals from governments,” he said. Governments have been introducing steps to reduce emissions, including promoting the use of electric cars, phasing out sales of more polluting diesel vehicles and encouraging use of renewable sources of energy. U.S. emissions have fallen to levels last seen 30 years ago as it uses more gas, which produces lower emissions than other fossil fuels such as oil and coal. Britain’s carbon pricing policy has cut its emissions to the lowest in over a century. But demand for oil continues to climb. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates global oil demand will hit 100 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first time this year. Without a major shift in policies, the IEA expects world oil demand to rise for at least the next 20 years, heading for 125 million bpd around mid-century. “The era of oil is far, in fact, very far from over,” chief executive of Abu Dhabi oil company ADNOC Sultan al-Jaber said. “There is healthier demand for our product, which is undeniably good news for our industry.”  Qatar Petroleum CEO Saad Al Kaabi said it was too much to expect a dramatic reduction in the use of oil and gas, given demand vehicle fuel and petrochemicals. “Oil is not going to completely go away but it is going to reduce,” he said. “Unless you give me a solution that’s different than just ‘renewables’, or say you want to do away with nuclear power also and so on, unless there is another way of getting there, it’s difficult to comprehend how we’ll achieve it,” he said.

2018-10-10,"LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s biggest trading houses said on Wednesday they saw oil prices not falling below $65 per barrel and possibly breaking above $100 next year as U.S. sanctions on Iran reduce crude exports from the Islamic republic.  The range of views illustrates deep uncertainty among top industry players over the outlook, given the reimposition of sanctions on Iran and forecasts of slowing economies and energy demand in 2019, potentially leading to choppy trading. Oil has rallied this year on expectations the sanctions, coming into force on Nov. 4, will strain supplies by lowering shipments from Iran, OPEC’s third-largest oil producer. Brent crude LCOc1 last week reached $86.74, the highest since 2014. Jeremy Weir, chief executive of Trafigura, said at the Oil & Money conference in London that he would not be surprised to see oil trade at more than $100 per barrel next year. Among others with a relatively bullish view was Alex Beard, chief executive for oil and gas at Glencore (GLEN.L), who forecast at the same event a mid-term oil price of $85-90. “I think the sanctions will be very tough,” Beard said. “Waivers will be extremely limited if any, and I don’t see an end to it as the objective is regime change in 2019. I can’t see anything that will affect oil prices dramatically to the downside.” A release of U.S. strategic oil stocks to ease the loss of Iranian supplies looked remote and would have limited impact anyway, and a plan by European nations aimed at maintaining trade with Iran was unlikely to help, he added. “The European payment mechanism doesn’t shield you if you use the U.S. financial system ... you can pay but don’t expect to be on their Christmas card list,” he said. Beard added that U.S. infrastructure limitations would limit U.S. crude exports that could otherwise compensate and new refining capacity coming online in 2019 would add further tightness. Some of the traders said, however, they expected some demand destruction in emerging economies to help cap prices. In 2019, forecasters such as the International Energy Agency say emerging-market crises and trade disputes could dent global demand while rising production from outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries adds to supply. [IEA/M]  The chief executive of Gunvor, Torbjorn Tornqvist, said he saw lower prices next year at $70-$75, citing a slowdown in demand growth and a well-supplied market.    “There will be some Iranian exports but the amount will depend on the price. If oil goes up to $100 a barrel then waivers, if it stays around $80 a barrel then no waivers,” Tornqvist said.  Vitol presented the most bearish views, with its chairman, Ian Taylor, forecasting a price of $65 a barrel. “We’ve knocked down our demand growth forecast this year and for next year ... I think the only issue is: will the U.S. pipelines in the Permian (basin) manage to deliver a huge increase in the second half of 2019?,” Taylor said.

2018-10-10,"LONDON (Reuters) - The United States is set to be the big winner from new marine fuel rules, trading house Gunvor Group predicted on Wednesday, while rival merchants said the world would not face a shortage of distillates as a result of new rules to cut pollution. The UN’s International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has set new rules that will ban ships from using fuels with a sulphur content above 0.5 percent from 2020, compared with 3.5 percent now, unless they are equipped with so-called scrubbers to clean up sulfur emissions. The industry has been expecting a sharp rise in demand for cleaner distillates, mainly diesel, at the expense of fuel oil that would become largely redundant. Gunvor Group Chief Executive Torbjorn Tornqvist said at the Oil & Money conference in London that the switch would certainly create some chaos at first as storage and logistics must deal with a “cocktail of fuel blends” and that the United States would be the major overall winner.  “Crude differentials will reflect the strong differentials between distillates (diesel) and fuel oil we will see the price of heavy crude fall and light sweet rise,” Tornqvist said. Heavy sour crudes yield much more fuel oil than light, sweet oil that have a maximum sulfur content of 0.5 percent, unless a refinery has advanced equipment.     “The big winner in the IMO is actually the United States. They have the most advanced refining system in the world and will take advantage of importing more heavy crude oil and they will export light crude oil that will get a bigger premium,” he said. Vitol Chairman Ian Taylor said he did not expect a major glut of high sulfur fuel oil as refiners were adding units.  “So many units have been prepared to reduce it and there’s so little high sulfur fuel left already,” Taylor said. Glencore’s head of oil Alex Beard echoed the remarks as scrubbers, add-on units to ship to clean out pollutants, would still allow ships to mop up some fuel oil. “Distillates will clearly play a very large role in shipping but what is becoming clear is that the world can cope, so it won’t be the crisis that people were thinking a year or two ago,” he said.  “Our estimate is that by January 2020, something like 25 percent of the world’s high sulfur fuel demand today will be from ships that have scrubbers and that will grow through 2020.”  Editing by David Evans",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-conference-imo/traders-say-u-s-to-be-big-winner-of-new-imo-shipping-rules-idUKL8N1WQ3XF,10 Oct 2018,"The United States is set to be

2018-10-10,"FRANKFURT, Oct 10 (Reuters) - European Union plans to cut carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles by 35 percent by 2030 pose a threat to Germany as a car-building nation, national auto industry association VDA said on Wednesday. “It is more than regrettable that the majority of member nations did not find the strength to strike a balance between protecting jobs and protecting the climate,” VDA president Bernard Mattes said in a statement. “Job security is lessened and Germany as an industrial location has been weakened,” added Mattes, who represents carmakers such as Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler. European Union nations, voicing concern over a U.N. report on global warming, agreed late on Tuesday to seek the 35 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from passenger cars by 2030. Several countries had sought a 40 percent reduction, in line with targets backed by EU lawmakers last week, but softened their position during late night negotiations in a step welcomed by the German government.

2018-10-10,"* Long-dated Treasury yields scale back from multi-year highs * Wall St stocks mixed, uncertainty prevails in Asia * Italian bond yields fall as govt moots “collaboration” with EU * Sterling strengthens on hopes for Brexit deal (Updates throughout) By Sujata Rao LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - World stocks flatlined on Wednesday just above eight-week lows, curbed by U.S. long-dated borrowing costs near multi-year peaks, renewed fears for the global economy and the possibility of an Italy-EU clash over budget spending. The effects on world markets of this week’s bond selloff that took U.S. 10-year bond yields to seven-year highs were exacerbated by economic growth concerns stemming from trade conflicts and $80-per-barrel oil, as the International Monetary Fund cut its world GDP forecasts for the first time in two years. The IMF’s estimates for the United States and China were both reduced, with the fund predicting the countries would feel the brunt of their trade war next year. It also slashed 2019 forecasts for emerging markets. MSCI’s world equity index which has spent four days in the red, was flat. While most Asian markets rose , European shares slipped 0.2 percent as the technology and luxury sectors were hit by U.S. tech weakness and fears of a Chinese economic slowdown. Wall Street futures indicated a flat opening for the S&P500 , while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was tipped to fall. “We are seeing more investors opting to wait and see how risks surrounding rising U.S. Treasury yields, global growth and China play out”, Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group said. “Near-term risks to global financial stability have increased rapidly over the past few months. The markets have been relatively complacent, but we are starting to see an acknowledgement of these risks.” In China, the yuan slipped against the dollar for the fifth session out of the past six to approach four-year lows hit in August . The focus is on next week’s semi-annual U.S. report on currencies which, many reckon, could accuse Beijing of manipulating the yuan depreciation. Stocks have been rocked this week by a heavy selloff on U.S. Treasuries where 10-year borrowing costs hit a 7-1/2-year peak of 3.261 percent. Yields stand off those levels but rose 2 basis points on the day to 3.23 percent. “We are at some sort of critical moment, a crossroads, for bond and equity markets,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, global head of economic research at Indosuez Wealth Management. U.S. 10-year yields at 2 percent unequivocally favour equity investment but this is not the case above 3 percent, she said. “This January we took out the 2 percent (yield) handle and now we are wondering if we are permanently taking out the 3 percent handle as well. That makes the climate for equities much more challenging.” Owens Thomsen warned though that deceleration in economic growth could curb the rise in yields. The Treasury selloff may have paused also after President Donald Trump complained the Federal Reserve was going too fast with rate hikes. In Europe, there has been more bellicose rhetoric from Italian politicians, many of whom appear to be girding for battle with European Union authorities after unveiling a bigger-than-expected budget deficit. However, Italian stocks rose 0.3 percent after Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said he expected “collaboration” with the EU. He had pledged on Tuesday to restore calm if market turbulence escalated into financial crisis. His comments also took Italian bond yields further off multi-year highs, with 10-year borrowing costs down six bps . Shares in Italian banks, volatile because of the lenders’ government bond holdings, also got a boost after an EU official told Reuters Italian banks’ there was no cause for alarm about Italian banks’ liquidity levels . “At the current junction I don’t think (Italy) are anywhere near a position where they can provoke another crisis in Europe,” Owens Thomsen said. Politics were in focus in Britain too, where reports of progress in negotiating a Brexit deal with the EU pushed the pound to 3-1/2-month highs versus the dollar. . The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies, easing from seven-week peaks. The IMF growth forecast cuts pulled oil prices off 4-1/2-year highs above $85, though they were supported by Hurricane Michael which has shut nearly 40 percent of crude output in the Gulf of Mexico.

2018-10-10,"* Keeping all staff in anticipation of full production * Cannot give time for full operation * Aluminium demand little affected by U.S-China trade dispute (Adds CEO comments on aluminium market) OSLO, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Norway’s Norsk Hydro is focused on a return to full output at its Alunorte alumina refinery in Brazil and is not contemplating layoffs there, CEO Svein Richard Brandtzaeg told Reuters on Wednesday. Hydro had said last week it would close down the world’s largest alumina refinery and lay off 4,700 workers as attempts to resolve an environmental dispute with Brazilian authorities faltered. This week it announced it has been granted permits from the authorities to restart operations at half capacity. “The way we are operating now requires more staffing. As long as we have a positive dialogue with the authorities we will keep the staffing. We believe the embargo will be lifted and then we need all our people,” Brandtzaeg told Reuters in a telephone interview. Hydro was ordered by Brazilian regulators in February to slash output by half at the refinery after the company admitted making unlicensed emissions of untreated water during severe rains. “It’s difficult to give exact timeline for a full restart but we are now in the process of implementing measures we agreed on with authorities in September,” he said. The plant has an annual capacity of 6.4 million tonnes of alumina, or 10 percent of capacity outside China. Alunorte transforms bauxite into alumina, which is turned into aluminium at huge smelters. Alumina and aluminium prices have been pushed up by Hydro’s production cut at Alunorte. Brandtzaeg acknowledged it was unfortunate that Hydro one week announced plans for closure and the next week plans to recover output. “We want stable and predictable operations, but in this case it was not possible,” he said. Overall demand in the market was “quite good”, driven by auto industry and global GDP growth, Brandtzaeg said, repeating Hydro’s forecast for an aluminium market deficit of 1-1.5 million tonnes this year. “There’s still a lot of aluminium in storage but its gradually reducing. The supply deficit is covered by reserve capacity in China but even with China we have a deficit of 1-1.5 million tonnes globally,” Brandtzaeg said. He said the trade war between China and U.S. so far had little impact. “It seems consumers have to pay for this. Margins for U.S. exporters seems to be the same (despite a tariff increase on Chinese aluminium),” Brandtzaeg said.

2018-10-10,"SEATTLE, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From the Bullitt Center’s roof, Seattle’s status as the North American crane capital is in full view. Sixty-five cranes are currently reshaping the Seattle skyline, a building boom that reflects this city’s phenomenal growth spurt. In U.S. Census data released this year Seattle was ranked the fastest growing U.S. big city over the last decade, with new residents pouring in to take jobs at companies such as Amazon.com. But that growth is a worry as the “Emerald City” - nicknamed for its evergreen trees and environmentalist politics - strives to become “carbon neutral” by 2050, meaning it will produce no more climate-changing emissions than it can offset by measures such as planting carbon-absorbing trees. A building boom unlike any seen since the late 19th century Yukon Gold Rush is making an already challenging goal harder, experts say. Seattle’s greenhouse gas emissions have fallen 6 percent since 2008, according to 2014 data, the most recently available from the city’s Office of Sustainability and the Environment. Over the same period, the city’s population grew 13 percent. “We have decoupled growth from emissions,” the city’s chief climate official, Jessica Finn Coven, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. But, nonetheless, “we’re not on track to meet our ambitious 2050 goals,” she said. As old structures fall and new ones are built, heating and lighting them account for a third of the city’s emissions, Finn Coven said. Figuring out how to slash emissions further without either scaring off economic development or hampering the pace of housing construction is a challenge, she admits. But “it’s not rocket science”, she said. “We have to stop heating our buildings with fossil fuels.” Companies leasing office space in the Bullitt Center, a six-story modern glass-and-concrete edifice eight blocks from downtown, are doing their part to help Seattle become carbon neutral. The Bullitt Center is the world’s largest “living building”, one that produces more energy than it consumes thanks to an energy-efficient design that exceeds the highest standards set by LEED, a green building ratings system. Floor-to-ceiling windows allow ample natural light during working hours. Windows open and close automatically to adjust the temperature, and an energy-sipping heat pump takes advantage of stable temperatures below ground to heat the building in the winter and cool it in the summer. A cantilevered roof, carpeted in photovoltaic panels, captures enough solar energy in this cloudiest of major U.S. cities to power the needs of an engineering firm, a tech company satellite office, and a home contractor, among others. Occupants of the building say it’s comfortable as well as efficient. “I love that there’s so much daylight,” said Amanda Falkenhagen, a lighting designer with Rushing, an engineering and sustainability consulting firm with an office in the center. “I was recently in a traditional office building and it made me realize all the things in this building I take for granted – the lightness, airiness, connectedness to the outside,” she said. Denis Hayes, president of the Bullitt Foundation, an environmental philanthropy serving the Pacific Northwest, noted that often, in the center, “there are no lights on, but nobody complains”. The foundation invested more than $32 million - a third of its $110 million endowment - in 2013 to erect the Bullitt Center, hoping to pave the way for other similar buildings. “It suddenly takes something that developers thought was impossible and shows that it’s in fact practical,” Hayes told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in the center’s airy conference room. The problem is the Bullitt Center still remains one of a kind - despite Hayes saying that if it was still the biggest “living” building in the world five years after being commissioned, “I would consider our efforts a failure”. Seattle hopes to change that through incentives. The Bullitt Center, for instance, benefitted from a pilot initiative that waived some zoning requirements on height and roof design, in order to accommodate its energy-efficient makeup. In April, Mayor Jenny Durkan reauthorized that programme and launched a new pilot that will allow up to 30 buildings to be built higher than existing rules permit if they meet certain energy efficiency standards. She also directed the city-run utility company, whose electricity comes almost entirely from hydropower, to feed excess energy created by buildings such as the Bullitt Center back into the power grid, and pay the building owners for creating it. The directive, which allows up to 30 buildings to feed power into Seattle’s electrical grid, aims to provide a financial incentive for building owners to make hefty investments in energy efficiency. Seattle also has put in place one of the United States’ strictest codes for energy efficiency in commercial buildings. It requires most new buildings to achieve an energy use index (EUI) rating in the 40s, according to Susan Wickwire, who directs the Seattle 2030 District, an initiative to encourage real estate developers and building managers to meet tough energy-efficiency standards. The average Seattle building has a rating between 80 and 90, Hayes said, while the Bullitt Center’s is 12. Wickwire’s group tracks the energy performance of 250 buildings out of 4,000 in an eight-square-mile (21 square km) area of the city that includes downtown Seattle. She thinks the incentive programme is a good one, and believes real estate developers and property managers are getting on board with greater energy efficency. “There is a shift in the DNA of the city to move away from fossil fuels to (greener) electricity and that’s only going to get tighter,” Wickwire said. But the overall energy efficiency of her district is dragged down by inefficient buildings constructed in the 1960s and 1970s, she said. Owners of those buildings are hesitant to pursue energy-efficiency retrofits, she said, because they would also trigger demands for other upgrades, such as improved access for the disabled and better ability to withstand earthquakes. Overcoming that problem may require further tweaks to city government policy to keep Seattle on target with its climate change goals. Those goals are ones activists such as Hayes see as key to helping set similar standards nationwide. ""If you can't do it in  Seattle, I don't know how you can do it in Cleveland,"" he said.

2018-10-10,"OSLO, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Norway’s Norsk Hydro is focused on a return to full output at its Alunorte alumina refinery in Brazil and is not contemplating layoffs there, CEO Svein Richard Brandtzaeg told Reuters on Wednesday. Hydro had said last week it would close down the world’s largest alumina refinery and lay off 4,700 workers as attempts to resolve an environmental dispute with Brazilian authorities faltered. On Tuesday it announced it has been granted permits from the authorities to restart operations at half capacity. “The way we are operating now requires more staffing. As long as we have a positive dialogue with the authorities we will keep the staffing. We believe the embargo will be lifted and then we need all our people,” Brandtzaeg told Reuters in a telephone interview. “It’s difficult to give exact timeline for a full restart but we are now in the process of implementing measures we agreed on with authorities in September,” he said. The plant has an annual capacity of 6.4 million tonnes of alumina, or 10 percent of capacity outside China. Alunorte transforms bauxite into alumina, which is turned into aluminium at huge smelters. Hydro was ordered by Brazilian regulators in February to slash output by half at the refinery after the company admitted making unlicensed emissions of untreated water during severe rains.

2018-10-10,"* Four Indian refiners to take extra 1 mln bbls each * Move comes after India cuts Iran imports * India turns to Saudi oil after arbitrage from US shuts (Adds details; background) By Jessica Jaganathan and Nidhi Verma SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, will supply Indian buyers with an additional 4 million barrels of crude oil in November, several sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The extra cargoes indicate a willingness by Saudi Arabia to increase crude supply to make up the shortfall once sanctions by the United States on oil exports from Iran, the third-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), start up on Nov. 4. India is Iran’s top oil client after China, though several refiners have indicated they will stop taking Iranian barrels because of the sanctions. Reliance Industries Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp , Bharat Petroleum Corp and Mangalore Refinery Petrochemicals Ltd are seeking an additional 1 million barrels each in November from Saudi Arabia, the sources said. Three of the companies did not immediately reply to an email from Reuters seeking comment. MRPL replied “no comments” when contacted by email. State-owned oil producer Saudi Aramco was not immediately available for comment. Given their dependence on Iranian oil supplies, the Indian refiners are concerned about the loss of Iranian crude once the sanctions start and are seeking exemptions. Refiners in the country have placed orders to buy 9 million barrels from Iran in November. One of the reasons for the additional demand for Saudi oil is that the crude arbitrage from the United States is shut so the Indian buyers have to turn to Middle Eastern barrels, said one of the sources. India, the world’s third biggest oil importer, is grappling with a combination of rising oil prices and falling local currency, which makes imports of dollar-denominated oil more expensive. Retail prices for gasoline and diesel fuel in India are at record highs and the government has cut its excise tax on fuel to ease some of the pain for consumers. Indian Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Monday that he spoke with Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih last week and reminded him that OPEC and other major oil producers had promised to raise their output at a meeting in June. India imports an average of 25 million barrels per month from Saudi Arabia. Reuters last week reported that Russia and Saudi Arabia, the world’s two biggest oil producers, struck a private deal in September to raise output to cool rising prices and had informed the United States about the decision.

2018-10-10,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Once surreptitiously dumped down drains in the dead of night, Asia’s used cooking oil is fast becoming one of the most sought-after commodities in Europe - as a feedstock for biodiesel. Aggressive green energy targets in the European Union that were bolstered further this year are pushing fuel makers to churn out biodiesel containing recycled cooking oils and fats, phasing out the use of fresh vegetable oils in the process by 2030.  That has unleashed a wave of demand for used oil from places such as China and Southeast Asia, where cooking oils are widely used to prepare everything from stir-fries to piping hot samosas. Amizuri Abdullah, who picks up used oil from restaurants, fast food outlets and food factories for Malaysian waste oil collection firm FatHopes Energy, said his job had been getting markedly busier. “When I first joined the company a year ago, there were about 15 or 16 stops to make in a day. Now there can be as many as 25, and more people are asking about it,” said Amizuri, who wears bright blue protective gloves to pump used oil into a tank on the back of his truck on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. The oil is unloaded at a collection center where it is filtered to remove food scraps like chicken bones and skin, before being processed to reduce contamination. It is then transferred into tankers for export to Europe. FatHopes Chief Executive Vinesh Sinha said the company’s exports of waste-based feedstock to European oil majors had grown 40 percent in the last three years, forecasting a threefold increase in Europe’s demand for such feedstock by 2030. Used cooking oil makes up a good chunk of what the company collects from thousands of sites across Southeast Asia, but it also buys coffee grinds, animal fats and palm oil mill waste.  “My clients are struggling to find feedstock in anticipation of the EU policy,” he said. (GRAPHIC: Biodiesel production by region since 2000 - tmsnrt.rs/2oYrmJI)     Asia’s used cooking oil industry was estimated to be worth around $500 million a couple of years ago, but analysts said more recent estimates were not available due to the rapid growth in the number of new collectors and traders. Justin Yuan, chief executive of the used cooking oil division at Chinese consulting company STIN Group, said shipments from China would likely hit 300,000 tonnes this year, up from 200,000 tonnes in 2017. He said most cargoes go to Europe and that volumes were set to keep surging in coming years. “More overseas biodiesel plants will source used cooking oil in China. With soaring demand from home and abroad, it will put great pressure on used cooking oil supplies,” Yuan said. “The competition will be fiercer.” Indeed, waste oil demand is already outstripping supply around Asia, with traders estimating that the premium it fetches over crude palm oil prices has doubled from around two years ago to stand at about 10-15 percent. Used cooking oil is traded at prices pegged to crude palm oil, typically trading at a premium due to its greener credentials. Traders said it currently cost around $600-700 a tonne on average. That appetite is also good news for the thousands of restaurants and other businesses where the used oil is collected, which typically earn around 40 U.S. cents per kilo of the commodity.  Analysts said that in the past many restaurants and food manufacturers poured old oil down the drain when the time came to replace it, often breaking rules designed to protect sewage systems that are very difficult to enforce. FAT-FINDING MISSION Today, collectors are competing to lock up supplies from around the region to feed expanding biofuel operations in Europe. In June, the European Union agreed to phase out crude vegetable oils usage in transport fuel from 2030 as part of a broader plan to increase the share of renewables in the bloc’s energy production. “The industry here (in Asia) is about whether you have the capacity to get more oil. Competition is very fierce now, so the margins we have are little,” said Rick Ng, business advisor for Singaporean waste oil collector Go Green Recycle Oil. In May, French oil major Total said waste material would account for 30-40 percent of feedstock supplies at its new 650,000 tonnes capacity biofuel refinery in southern France.  Britain-based biofuel supplier Greenergy in July acquired an idle vegetable oil processing plant in Amsterdam to turn waste oil into biodiesel. Greenergy, Europe’s largest producer of biofuels made from waste, in September also acquired Singapore-based used cooking oil exporter Rexon Energy to help secure raw material supplies. Meanwhile, Finnish biofuel producer Neste told Reuters by email that it was planning to double its waste-based refining capacity in Singapore to 2 million tonnes.  All that means that Amizuri back at FatHopes Energy in Kuala Lumpur could be set to get busier. “I think there is going to be more used cooking oil collected as awareness that it can be recycled rises. I think this industry is going to grow,” he said. “Instead of throwing it out, collect and sell it. There is value there.” (This version of the story was refiled to correct spelling error in 3rd paragraph)  Reporting by Emily Chow in KUALA LUMPUR; Additional reporting by Nigel Hunt and Ron Bousso in LONDON, Bate Felix in PARIS; Editing by Gavin Maguire and Joseph Radford",https://uk.reuters.com/article/asia-europe-wasteoil/refile-fat-profits-asian-traders-cash-in-as-europe-thirsts-for-waste-oils-idUKL4N1UQ46G,10 Oct 2018,"* Comes as EU pushes to phase out fresh vegetable oils in

2018-10-10,"* Lifespan ruling key for EDF * France has 58 nuclear reactors * Nuclear power crucial for French energy needs (Adds quotes, context) PARIS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - France’s ASN nuclear regulator will issue by the end of 2020 its long-awaited and much-delayed generic ruling on the life span extension of utility EDF’s nuclear plants, said the French government’s nominee to head the ASN. “Based on the information at my disposal, the generic ruling should be issued at the end of 2020,” Bernard Doroszczuk said at a French senate committee hearing about his nomination. The ruling, which is crucial for EDF, has been repeatedly delayed, most recently by outgoing ASN chief Pierre-Franck Chevet. Chevet said in November 2017 that the ASN would rule on those reactor lifespans in 2020-21, with a first recommendation in 2020 to be followed by a legally binding ruling in 2021. France’s 58 nuclear reactors, operated by state-controlled EDF, were built in large part between the end of the 1970s and the early 1980s.  They are coming to the end of their 40-year design lifespan, which EDF wants to extend to 50 years. The first of EDF’s 34 reactors with 900 megawatt capacity will reach the 40-year threshold in the next 2-3 years. At that point, each individual reactor is given a thorough inspection, and the ASN then rules on whether it can continue to operate. Doroszczuk said the ASN’s generic ruling on lifespan extensions was not a prerequisite for the 40-year inspections. He said these inspections would take place between 2019, starting with the Tricastin reactor, and continue until 2030 for EDF’s oldest generation of 900 megawatt reactors. The French government will publish its long-term energy strategy at the end of this month, which is set to define by when France will reduce the share of nuclear in electricity generation to 50 percent from the current 75 percent. That process could involve closing up to a third of EDF’s reactors. The government has said the ASN ruling will be a major factor in this decision and could hedge the long-term energy strategy on the outcome of the ASN ruling. Doroszczuk confirmed that the absence of a “core catcher” feature in EDF’s existing reactors will be an issue in the ASN’s lifespan decision. EDF’s new EPR reactor, under construction in Flamanville, has a giant ashtray-like bowl that can contain its core in case of meltdown, but older reactors lack this feature and could suffer the “China Syndrome” with molten fuel burning into the ground and reaching the water table in case of an accident. Doroszczuck said that not all EDF’s 900 MW reactors have the necessary space to add such a feature.

2018-10-10,"* Long-dated Treasury yields scale back from multi-year highs * Wall St stocks mixed, uncertainty prevails in Asia * Italian bond yields fall as govt moots “collaboration” with EU * Sterling strengthens on hopes for Brexit deal (updates throughout, changes byline, dateline) By Sujata Rao LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - World stocks inched off eight-week lows on Wednesday as U.S. long-dated borrowing costs held below multi-year peaks, though market gains were checked by fears for global economic growth and the possibility of an Italy-EU clash over budget spending. The effects of the global bond selloff that took U.S. 10-year bond yields to seven-year highs this week were exacerbated by economic growth concerns stemming from trade conflicts and $80-per-barrel oil, with the International Monetary Fund cutting its world GDP forecasts for the first time in two years. The IMF’s estimates for the United States and China were both reduced, with the fund predicting the countries would feel the brunt of their trade war next year. It also slashed its expectations for emerging markets for 2019. MSCI’s world equity index rose 0.14 percent after four days in the red. However, while Japan’s Nikkei and MSCI’s Asia-Pacific index outside Japan rose 0.2-0.3 percent, European shares slipped 0.2 percent, undermined by more bellicose rhetoric from Italian politicians. Milan-listed stocks traded 0.15 percent higher however, rising off 18-month lows hit earlier in the week. Wall Street was set to open flat to weaker, futures showed. There are also concerns over China where the yuan slipped against the dollar for the fifth session out of the past six to approach four-year lows hit in August . The focus is on next week’s semi-annual U.S. report on currencies amid Treasury officials’ comments that recent yuan depreciation has raised concerns in Washington. However, some relief came from U.S. Treasuries where 10-year borrowing costs kept well below a 7-1/2-year peak of 3.261 percent. “We are at some sort of critical moment, a crossroads, for bond and equity markets,” Marie Owens Thomsen, global head of economic research at Indosuez Wealth Management, said noting that while U.S. 10-year yields at 2 percent unequivocally favoured equity investment, this was not so above 3 percent. “This January we took out the 2 percent (yield) handle and now we are wondering if we are permanently taking out the 3 percent handle as well. That makes the climate for equities much more challenging,” Owens Thomsen added. She cautioned though that signs of deceleration in world growth and IMF forecast cuts could curb the relentless rise in yields which was partly fuelled by buoyant U.S. economic data. The Treasury selloff may have been curbed also after U.S. President Donald Trump complained said the Federal Reserve was going too fast in raising rates. But they rose 1.3 basis points to 3.22 percent on Wednesday, also getting some traction from Europe, where German yields inched up amid fresh concerns in Italy. Italian bond yields pulled off multi-year highs on Tuesday after Economy Minister Giovanni Tria pledged action to restore calm should market turbulence escalate into financial crisis. Yields slipped further after Tria said he expected “collaboration” with the EU on the budget issue. But markets’ pressure has not dissuaded the government from a bigger-than-expected budget deficit; ministers’ comments appear to indicate they are prepared to defy European Union critics. The developments have raised risks of a credit ratings downgrade for the country, with a knock-on effect for Italian banks which are big holders of government bonds. However the banks’ shares received a boost after an EU official told Reuters regulators were “intensely” monitoring Italian banks’ liquidity levels but there was no cause for alarm. “I am not saying Italy is managing the situation in an ideal fashion but at the current junction I don’t think they are anywhere near a position where they can provoke another crisis in Europe,” Owens Thomsen said. Politics were also in focus in Britain where reports of progress between the UK and the EU in negotiating a Brexit deal pushed the pound to 3-1/2-month highs against the dollar. Analysts at Eurizon SLJ Capital said parliamentary approval looked likely for Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal. The Times newspaper reported 30-40 opposition Labour MPs would back the agreement. “Already significantly undervalued, sterling has upside risks, especially against the euro,” Eurizon SLJ told clients, arguing that $1.55 was “fair value” for the currency. The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies, easing from seven-week peaks after Treasury yields retreated. That allowed emerging currencies, hard hit in recent days, to make tentative gains. The IMF growth forecast cuts weighed on oil prices, pulling them off 4-1/2-year highs above $85, though the market was somewhat supported by Hurricane Michael which has shut nearly 40 percent of crude output in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.

2018-10-10,"(Adds details on well, comments on Q3 production) Oct 10 (Reuters) - Oil and gas company Kosmos Energy said on Wednesday it was abandoning an offshore well in Suriname after it failed to find oil, the second well plugged in the region in recent months, but added that it plans to continue testing in the basin due to its potential. The company also said it expects to generate substantial free cash flow in 2018, allowing it to initiate a dividend in the first quarter of 2019. Kosmos said it encountered high-quality reservoir at the Pontoenoe-1 exploration well in Block 42 offshore Suriname, but the primary exploration objective proved to be water bearing and did not find commercial hydrocarbons. “We are in the early stages of exploring the emerging Suriname-Guyana basin.... We believe there is significant remaining potential in Block 42,” Kosmos Chief Executive Officer Andrew Inglis said, adding that the company’s current plan was to test the next prospect in 2020. The NYSE-listed company holds rights in Block 42 under a production sharing contract with the Suriname government-owned Staatsolie Maatschappij Suriname NV. Kosmos said production in Ghana continues to grow after the Jubilee turret remediation work and the new wells brought online at both Jubilee and TEN during the quarter.

2018-10-10,"SARAJEVO, Oct 10 (Reuters) - A powerful blast that rocked Bosnia’s oil refinery Brod late on Tuesday has left one worker dead and nine injured, of whom four seriously, officials said on Wednesday. Firefighters put down the blaze at the plant’s oil and gas processing unit shortly after midnight and rescuers later discovered one body inside the facility, said Brod’s mayor, Ilija Jovicic. Previous reports said eight people were injured in the blast. Jovicic said the refinery has continued operating after the incident, adding that an investigation, which was still underway, should establish the cause of the explosion. The Brod refinery, which processes 1.2 million tonnes of crude a year, is majority owned by Russia’s Neftegazinkor, a unit of state-owned oil company Zarubezhneft. Auditors have warned that it may face liquidity problems after it piled up losses and its liabilities exceeded assets. The company, however, has dismissed those claims. Citizens of nearby Slavonski Brod just across the border in Croatia have complained about rising pollution levels from the refinery for years and Bosnian and Croatian authorities have been working to combat this issue. Air quality measures showed no major spike in pollution levels on Wednesday, Jovicic said.

2018-10-10,"LONDON (Reuters) - British energy suppliers SSE (SSE.L) and Innogy SE’s (IGY.DE) Npower on Wednesday won final regulatory approval for a tie-up of their retail units, clearing the way for the creation of the UK’s second-largest retail power provider.  The merger, given the go-ahead by Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), would create a new entity with a 23 percent market share, the second largest in the UK market behind Centrica’s (CNA.L) British Gas, with 27 percent.  It would also cut the “Big Six” providers to five. The companies aim to complete the deal by the first quarter of next year at the latest, they said earlier this year.  After a review of the deal, the CMA decided to clear the merger as SSE and Npower are not close rivals for customers on standard variable tariffs (SVT), it said. “With many energy companies out there, people switching away from expensive standard variable tariffs will still have plenty of choice when they shop around after this merger,” said Anne Lambert, chair of the CMA’s inquiry group. The CMA found that the number of people switching energy providers in Britain was the highest in a decade, and the proportion on SVTs has fallen. Those who do not switch are usually on one of the large energy suppliers’ already expensive SVTs, so the CMA examined whether the merger would change how those prices are set. While SVT prices are mainly driven by changes in wholesale costs, large energy suppliers take account of each other’s tariff changes when setting their own, the CMA said.  The watchdog looked at whether a reduction in the number of large suppliers would encourage larger or earlier tariff changes. “In this case, SSE and Npower do not pay special attention to each other, consistent with the evidence that they are not close rivals for SVT customers, who instead prefer to move to other suppliers,” the CMA said. Energy regulator Ofgem’s cap on such tariffs should also help to protect SVT customers, the CMA said. Both SSE and Innogy welcomed the CMA’s decision. Innogy said preparations for the new British retail energy company are progressing and both parties have achieved important milestones in recent months. “This is a complex transaction and there is still much work to do in the coming weeks and months,” said Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive of SSE. “However, we’ve always believed that the creation of a new, independent energy and services retailer has the potential to deliver real benefits for customers and the market as a whole,” he added.

2018-10-10,"(Reuters) - Iraqi Kurdistan-focussed oil producer Genel Energy (GENL.L) expects 2018 output to be slightly above the prior target of 32,800 barrels of oil per day (bopd), as production ramps up at its cash generating Peshkabir field, it said on Wednesday.  Shares of the company rose 4.1 percent to 256.1 pence in early minutes of trade. Genel, which has been operating in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq for over a decade, has benefited from strong output at the Peshkabir oilfield operated by Norwegian oil firm DNO ASA (DNO.OL) and 25 percent owned by Genel. DNO said earlier this week that production at Peshkabir had ramped up to 50,000 bopd, meeting the year-end target ahead of schedule and below budget. Genel, looking to wipe out its net debt by year-end, also said it became net cash positive with a cash pile of $281 million (213.6 million pounds) and net debt reduced to $16 million as of Sept. 30. Founded in 2011 by former BP boss Tony Hayward and billionaire financier Nathaniel Rothschild, Genel has been having a good run, as Kurdistan regional government makes regular payments to the company. This has helped the company’s shares to more than double in value this year. Its cash position was helped by the receipt of $32 million after the end of third quarter, related to July exports. Net production for the third quarter averaged slightly lower than last year, at 33,650 bopd, as the company recovers from a slowdown in production at its Taq Taq field, once considered its flagship. The field has now stabilised and its five-well programme, aimed at increasing production, is underway at the field, the company said. Genel now expects 2018 capital expenditure to be towards the lower end of its prior guidance range of $95 million-$125 million, which was narrowed in August from $95 million-$145 million.

2018-10-10,"* Q3 production fell to 406,000 boe/d * Q3 refining margin at $5.69 per barrel * Q3 refinery utilization rate at 98 pct (Adds refining data, third-quarter forecast, quote) VIENNA, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Austrian energy group OMV on Wednesday reported a quarter-on-quarter fall in third-quarter oil and gas production, largely due to maintenance work in Russia and Austria and the sale of its Pakistan exploration business. Output fell to 406,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) from 419,000 boe/d in the second quarter, it said. The refining margin - the company’s earnings from turning the crude oil into fuel and diesel - increased to $5.69 per barrel from $5.23 in the second quarter. The utilization rate of its refineries was at 98 percent after 77 percent in the previous period. The sale of its Samsun plant in Turkey will lower third-quarter net income by 160 million euros ($184.02 million), Austria’s largest energy group said. “This stems from the negative development of the Turkish lira against the euro since the investment in the power plant,” the group said in a statement. OMV pulled out of electricity generation in Turkey in May in line with its strategy to reduce the exposure of non-integrated power business. OMV is due to report third-quarter results on Oct. 31. Analysts expect net income of 504 million euros on sales of 7 billion euros, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. $1 = 0.8695 euros

2018-10-10,"YAOUNDE, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Prince Djabea, 15, stamps on a plastic bottle as if squashing a cockroach, then using the heel of his other foot, flicks the bottle cap through the air with a pop. He is not showing off the latest street dance craze in Douala, Cameroon’s commercial capital, but taking part in one of the country’s biggest plastic recycling schemes striving to turn waste into something useful while cleaning up the environment. Behind Djabea, about 30 teenagers gather plastic bottles clogging up drainage canals and gutters, while others go door to door asking residents for their plastic rubbish. It is all loaded into giant tarpaulin sacks that are weighed at the end of the day and then sent to be remade into shoes, chairs and floor tiles, among other products. The initiative led by RED-PLAST, brainchild of 30-year-old environmental engineer Alain Rodrigue Ngonde Elong, operates in Yaounde too, collecting 100 to 150 tonnes of plastic waste per year - roughly the weight of 55 African forest elephants. Elong came up with the idea as a student in Douala. “You just saw the rubbish, the plastic everywhere you looked,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, describing open drainage channels lining the streets blocked by plastic bottles. In the rainy season, the channels overflowed and attracted mosquitoes, which bred and in turn increased rates of malaria and dengue fever among local inhabitants, Elong said. “No one had a solution for it,” he added. Today, Elong’s team works on the problem by organising a month-long rubbish collection campaign every quarter, employing everyone from teenagers eager for work experience to street children needing fast cash. The youngsters earn on average 35,000 CFA francs ($62) per month, though their income varies according to how much they collect and the amount RED-PLAST is paid by the city council. In recent years, young activists and entrepreneurs across West and Central Africa have launched a host of creative solutions to tackle the problem of discarded plastic. In Cameroon’s coastal town of Kribi, engineer Ismael Essome builds boats from plastic bottles for fishing and eco-tourism. In Lagos, Nigeria, start-up Wecyclers runs a trash collection and recycling business, providing revenue for slum residents who gather rubbish by bicycle and are paid for the service. Further afield in South Africa, the Rethaka Foundation transforms waste plastic into school bags fitted with a portable solar-powered light to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds do their homework after dark. Meanwhile, in towns and villages across Africa, street vendors collect plastic bottles and refill them with goods to sell, from peanuts and oil to fresh juice and even petrol. Yet despite growing efforts across Africa to reuse plastic, much of the waste continues to blight local environments as litter, is burned or buried in the ground. Around the world, researchers estimate that about 8 million tonnes of plastic waste leak from land into the sea each year. In Cameroon, Essome’s plastic boats have won international awards and recognition, making waves as far away as Madrid where his team was asked to construct an eco-boat. But they have received no funding from governments or charities that would allow them to expand their venture. “Because we are young and working in a new field in Cameroon, it’s a big challenge,” said Essome, who is set to represent his country at the One Young World Summit for young global leaders in The Hague this month. RED-PLAST founder Elong said obtaining government funding was a slow process but the group had succeeded in securing subsidies from several local authorities, as well as income from businesses that buy the waste to make plastic products. Yet his outfit still lacks the resources to collect plastic on a daily basis which would boost results, Elong added. Enterprises like his also have a mountain to climb as the amount of plastic waste is increasing. In 2010, Africa was estimated to have 4.4 million metric tonnes of mismanaged plastic waste – a figure that could rise to 10.5 million tonnes in 2025 if nothing is done, scientists warned in a study published this month. Coupled with unprecedented population growth, ballooning waste is likely to pose major problems even as local recycling initiatives multiply, environmental activists say. Osric Tening Forton, an environmental risk expert with the African Development Bank, said better regulation and stronger enforcement of existing laws are needed for private-sector recycling to flourish. The problem is not exclusive to Africa. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said in May that plastic recycling around the world is “failing to reach its full potential”. It called for the introduction of higher taxes on the manufacture and use of new plastics, and more mechanisms to make consumers pay for single-use plastic bags, cutlery and straws. Another major challenge is changing individual behaviour, said Elong. “Some people tell me: I haven’t eaten for two days – why should I care about recycling plastics?’,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. In response, he explains recycling can help them earn money to improve their lives, while also benefiting the environment. “At the end of the day, we need to make people understand that recycling is also profitable,” said Elong. $1 = 566.7000 CFA francs

2018-10-10,"SINGAPORE, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Maersk Oil Trading has leased oil storage space in Singapore, signalling a push by one of the world’s biggest ship fuel buyers into the Asian bunkering hub ahead of changes to global fuel standards from 2020, trade sources said. Maersk Oil has taken storage at the Tankstore oil terminal in Singapore, a spokesman for parent A.P. Moller-Maersk told Reuters, without giving further details. The firm has leased 120,000 cubic meters of space for fuel oil for six months, said three trade sources with direct knowledge of the matter. The sources declined to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media. Maersk Oil is a major ship fuel supplier globally but has not had its own storage tanks in Singapore for the supply of marine fuels to its customers, which include A.P. Moller-Maersk, the world’s biggest container line. The move comes ahead of the 2020 introduction of new rules on marine fuels that will limit the sulphur content to 0.5 percent, from 3.5 percent currently, to curb pollution. Maersk announced in August a deal with Royal Vopak, an independent tank storage operator, to launch a 0.5 percent sulphur fuel bunkering facility in Rotterdam. The joint initiative will meet about 20 percent of Maersk’s global demand for IMO 2020 compliant fuels “and we are looking into more bunkering facilities like this,” Niels-Henrik Lindegaard, head of Maersk Oil Trading, told Reuters last month. The Singapore storage lease comes at a time of a steeply backwardated market structure, which has led several suppliers not to renew their fuel oil storage contracts in Singapore this year, the sources said. Storing oil products is difficult in a backwardated market since prompt prices are higher than forward prices, making it difficult for traders to recover the costs of storage. The Singapore Strait is one of the world’s busiest shipping superhighways, allowing Singapore to position itself as the world’s largest bunkering hub with more than 40,000 ships calling at the city-state for refuelling each year.

2018-10-10,"* Long-dated Treasury yields scale back from multi-year highs * Wall St stocks mixed, uncertainty prevails in Asia * Spreadbetters see European shares opening lower * Sterling strengthens on hopes for Brexit deal By Tomo Uetake TOKYO, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Asian shares staged a mild rebound on Wednesday after world stocks hit eight-week lows the previous day on worries about global economic growth, although the British pound stayed firm on hopes for a Brexit deal. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei average added 0.2 percent and the Australian benchmark was up just 0.1 percent. In China, the mainland benchmark Shanghai Composite was flat in choppy trade, although Hong Kong’s Hang Seng advanced 0.6 percent. With world stocks still near to multi-week lows, financial spreadbetters expect London’s FTSE to open 12 points lower, Frankfurt’s DAX to fall 23 points, and Paris’s CAC to dip 3 points. “As uncertainty continues to prevail in financial markets across the world, many investors are staying on the sidelines until more clarity emerges in U.S. Treasury and Chinese markets,” said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments. Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields touched a 7-1/2-year peak of 3.261 percent and those on 30-year bonds hit their highest in more than four years, but later fell back. Some traders say comments from  U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday helped curb the rise in Treasuries’ yields. He said the Federal Reserve was going too fast in raising rates when inflation was minimal and government data pointed to a strong economy. Italian government bond yields also fell from multi-year highs after Economy Minister Giovanni Tria pledged to do whatever is necessary to restore calm if market turbulence turns into a financial crisis. U.S. stock markets were uneventful. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.21 percent while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were little changed. The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, hit its lowest level since August 16 overnight. It last traded up 0.2 percent on the day. The International Monetary Fund cut its global economic growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019, as well as its U.S. and China estimates for next year, saying the two countries would feel the brunt of the impact of their trade war next year. The dollar dipped due to a fall in U.S. bond yields after touching a seven-week peak against a basket of currencies. The dollar index last traded flat at 95.560. Sterling continued to gain after a report rekindled hopes that Britain and the European Union are on the brink of a Brexit deal. It last traded up 0.2 percent at $1.3172. “We can’t be too optimistic about the Brexit process, because even if a deal can be struck at an anticipated special EU summit in November, it has to get through the British Parliament,” said Kengo Suzuki, chief FX strategist at Mizuho Securities. The offshore yuan rose 0.1 percent to 6.9200 after falling earlier this week to as low as 6.9371 to the dollar, its weakest since mid-August. Sentiment was calm in the spot market, where the yuan opened at 6.9220 per dollar and was changing hands at 6.9209 by midday, 51 pips stronger than the previous late session close. But in the long run, analysts expect the Chinese currency to trend lower amid economic slowdown fears, with current and former central bank officials downplaying the significance of the yuan breaking through the psychologically important 7 level. Oil prices dropped on Wednesday after the IMF lowered its global growth forecasts, although prices were somewhat supported as Hurricane Michael churned towards Florida, closing down nearly 40 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico crude output.

2018-10-10,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump launched an effort on Tuesday to increase ethanol use in the nation’s gasoline pool, delivering a long-sought political victory to the country’s Farm Belt and angering oil refiners ahead of November’s congressional elections. Trump announced the lifting of a ban on summer sales of gasoline blended with 15 percent ethanol, known as E15, at a closed-door meeting at the White House, Republican senators told reporters after the meeting. “My administration is protecting ethanol. ... Today we are unleashing the power of E15 to fuel our country all year long,” Trump told a cheering crowd of supporters at a rally in Council Bluffs, Iowa. The announcement capped a months-long effort by the White House to thread the needle between rival corn and oil industry interests, by boosting ethanol demand while also cutting costs for refiners. In the end, Trump is moving ahead without the support of the oil refining industry, which wanted more in return for agreeing to lift the summer ban. The move is also aimed at helping the political fortunes of Republican candidates in the Midwest saddled with a tough farm economy and the imposition of import tariffs by Trump and China. Polls show close election races in Iowa for the governor’s seat and two congressional seats. Trump told the rally that Democrats would “end ethanol” if given the chance. “You’d better get out there and vote for Republicans,” he said. Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives, said in a statement: “Democrats remain vigilant to ensure that this new measure will create real benefits for America’s farmers.” Iowa is the nation’s biggest producer of corn, and farmers there have been frustrated with falling corn and soybean prices hurt by the trade war between the United States and China. “It’s about time,” said Warren Bachman, a 72-year-old corn and soybean farmer in Iowa. “With all the trade wars, tariffs and low crop prices, it seems like we are taking it in the shorts and bearing all the burden.” Since ethanol is cheaper than gasoline, the administration hopes to lower pump prices, which currently average $2.91 a gallon, more than 40 cents higher than this time a year ago, according to the American Automobile Association. The Environmental Protection Agency prohibits summer sales of E15 in certain areas because of smog concerns. For the ban to be removed, it must draft and finalize a rule in the spring.  “I feel certain this rule can be accomplished before the driving season next year,” U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue told Reuters in an interview.  Biofuel advocates hope the lifting of the ban will boost ethanol sales. Geoff Cooper, chief executive of the Renewable Fuels Association trade group, said allowing E15 sales year-round could double sales of the higher-ethanol blend from roughly 400 million gallons currently.  “It depends on how quickly new pumps would be added ... the greatest impact will be longer-term,” Cooper said. He said the move was a great first step, but noted it faced significant political and legal opposition. “We are happy, but we know there’s still a long road ahead,” Cooper said.     The rule would be coupled with restrictions on the multibillion-dollar biofuel credit trading industry sought by merchant refiners like Valero Energy Corp and PBF Energy Inc. Those rules will seek to stop parties from hoarding the credits and driving up the cost of complying with biofuels blending laws. Refiners are required to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like ethanol into the fuel pool annually, or buy credits from competitors who do. Refining companies that buy the credits have complained about volatile prices. The EPA will consider forcing blenders, retailers and trading houses to sell credits more quickly to reduce market volatility, a White House official said. But that is not enough for the refiners. The American Petroleum Institute, the largest U.S. oil trade association, opposes lifting the ban, saying E15 gasoline ruins older cars and potentially voids warranties. “The only certainty from today’s actions is a lawsuit,” Chet Thompson, head of American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, said on Tuesday. He said the industry would challenge the finalized rule in court, saying the EPA had acknowledged it lacks the authority to change this rule. Last year, biofuel credit prices rose to nearly $1 each, near a five-year high, as merchant refiners warned that plants may be forced to close without federal action. Prices dropped after the EPA expanded its use of waivers freeing small refiners from their obligations. The credits were trading at roughly 12 cents each on Tuesday, traders said.

The Australian benchmark was up 0.11 percent. “As uncertainty continues to prevail in financial markets across the world, many investors are staying on the sidelines until more clarity emerges in U.S. Treasury and Chinese markets,” said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments. Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields touched a 7-1/2-year peak of 3.261 percent and those on 30-year bonds hit their highest in more than four years. The 30-year bond yields had risen on the prospect of Federal Reserve rates rising over the next 18 months or so, but later fell back. Traders largely ignored comments on Tuesday from U.S. President Donald Trump in which he said the Federal Reserve was going too fast in raising rates when inflation was minimal and government data pointed to a strong economy. Italian government bond yields also fell from multi-year highs after Economy Minister Giovanni Tria pledged to do whatever is necessary to restore calm if market turbulence turns into a financial crisis. On stock markets, Wall Street stocks showed a mixed picture, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.21 percent while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were little changed. The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, hit the lowest level since August 16 overnight. It last traded up 0.l5 percent on the day. The International Monetary Fund cut global economic growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019, as well as its U.S. and China estimates for next year, saying the two countries would feel the brunt of the impact of their trade war next year. The dollar dipped due to a fall in U.S. bond yields after touching a seven-week peak against a basket of currencies. The dollar index last traded flat at 95.609. Sterling continued to rise after a report that rekindled hopes that Britain and the European Union are on the brink of a Brexit deal. It last traded up 0.1 percent. The offshore yuan rose 0.1 percent to 6.9225 after falling to as low as 6.9371 to the dollar earlier in the week, its weakest since early February.

2018-10-10,"MELBOURNE, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Plans by Australia’s AGL Energy to start importing liquefied natural gas from 2021 will be delayed after the state of Victoria called for the company and its pipeline partner to submit a full environmental assessment of their project. The review process typically takes nine to 12 months, which means AGL will not be able to reach a final investment decision on the A$250 million ($178 million) jetty project by June 2019, as it had hoped. AGL had been on track to be the first of four proposed LNG import projects looking to fill an expected gas supply shortfall in southeastern Australia from 2021. AGL declined to comment on Wednesday on how the environmental review would affect the project’s timing but said it was committed to working with the community and following all state and regulatory assessment requirements. “Crib Point will be a safe and environmentally responsible project, making gas supply for Victorians more secure, whilst critically bringing much needed competition to place downward pressure on gas prices,” AGL general manager Phaedra Deckart, who is leading the project, said in an emailed statement. The state’s move follows protests in the community around the Western Port location where AGL plans to build a jetty to park a ship that would regasify imported liquefied natural gas (LNG), and hook it up to a new gas pipeline to be built by APA Group. “While this project has great potential, it’s critical we assess its impacts thoroughly, to protect the community and the environment,” state planning minister Richard Wynne said in a statement on Tuesday. The state’s Labor government, heading to an election in November, has yet to determine the scope of the review, but it would include looking at the impact of AGL’s floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) on the internationally recognised wetlands area around the proposed jetty. “We’re encouraged the state is using this process. It means there’s going to be proper scrutiny of the project,” said Nicholas Aberle, who has been leading a campaign against the project for green group Environment Victoria. The group is concerned about the impact on sea life from chlorinated water that would be dumped from the FSRU, and argues that Australia, the world’s second-largest LNG exporter, should not need to import gas. “We could have a gas reservation policy. We could get smarter about cutting our energy waste. So why are we even entertaining the idea of damaging an internationally recognised wetlands?” Aberle said.

2018-10-10,"TOKYO, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged lower on Wednesday after the IMF lowered its global growth forecasts but prices were supported as Hurricane Michael churned towards Florida, causing the shutdown of nearly 40 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico crude output. Brent crude futures were down 2 cents at $84.98 a barrel by 0049 GMT, after a 1.3 percent gain on Tuesday. US. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down by 16 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $74.8 a barrel, after rising nearly 1 percent in the previous session. The International Monetary Fund downgraded its global economic growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019 on Tuesday, potentially tempering demand for oil and its products. Trade tensions and rising import tariffs were taking a toll on commerce, while emerging markets struggle with tighter financial conditions and capital outflows, the IMF said. “Prices are peaking at the most opportunistic time given waning global growth narrative,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading APAC at OANDA in Singapore. In the United States, nearly 40 percent of daily crude oil production was lost from offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico wells on Tuesday because of platform evacuations and shut-ins ahead of Hurricane Michael. Oil producers evacuated personnel from 75 platforms as the storm made its way through the central Gulf on the way to landfall on Wednesday on the Florida Panhandle. The country’s largest privately owned crude terminal, the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port LLC, said late on Tuesday it had halted operations at its marine terminal. The facility is the only U.S. port able to fully load and unload tankers with a capacity of 2 million barrels of oil. Companies turned off daily production of about 670,800 barrels of oil and 726 million cubic feet of natural gas by midday on Tuesday, according to offshore regulator the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. Iran’s crude exports fell further in the first week of October, according to tanker data and an industry source, as buyers sought alternatives ahead of U.S. sanctions that take effect on Nov. 4. Industry and government data on U.S. crude inventories will be delayed by one day this week because of Monday’s U.S. Columbus Day holiday. The American Petroleum Institute is due to release data on Wednesday, while the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due to publish on Thursday.

2018-10-10,"(Adds offshore port halts operations) HOUSTON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Nearly 40 percent of daily crude oil production was lost from offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico wells on Tuesday because of  platform evacuations and shut-ins ahead of Hurricane Michael. Oil producers - including Anadarko Petroleum Corp, BHP Billiton, BP and Chevron Corp - have since Monday evacuated personnel from 75 platforms as the storm made its way through the central Gulf on the way to landfall on Wednesday on the Florida Panhandle. The country’s largest privately owned crude terminal, the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port LLC, said on Tuesday it had halted operations at its marine terminal. The facility is the only port in the United States capable of fully loading and unloading tankers with a capacity of 2 million barrels of oil. Companies turned off daily production of about 670,800 barrels of oil and 726 million cubic feet of natural gas by midday on Tuesday, according to offshore regulator the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE). The evacuations affected about 11 percent of the occupied platforms in the Gulf, it said. U.S. crude futures settled up less than 1 percent at $74.96 per barrel, reflecting the declining importance of the Gulf of Mexico in output because of the growth of production from the nation’s onshore shale fields. Crude output lost in the two days of storm shut-ins represents about 9 percent of the U.S. production of 11.1 million barrels per day, according to data from the Energy Information Administration. In addition to shutting in wells, oil producers also halted most offshore drilling operations by evacuating three drilling rigs and moving eight others out of the storm area, BSEE said. Coastal and onshore energy businesses also started preparations for what is expected to become a Category 3 storm packing winds of at least 111 miles per hour (178 km per hour). Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspectors at Southern Co’s Farley Plant near Dothan, Alabama, about 100 miles (160 km) from the coast, were observing final storm preparations at the 1,751 megawatt (MW) nuclear power station on Tuesday, NRC spokesman Joey Ledford said in an email. One megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes on average. The U.S. Coast Guard on Tuesday closed the ports of Panama City and Pensacola, Florida, and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway east of Perdido Pass to vessel traffic, citing expectations for gale force winds within 12 hours. Other ports further west were still operating normally. However, operations including rail car loadings will cease at 5 p.m. at the State of Alabama’s Mobile port, spokeswoman Sheri Collins said. Pilots who bring vessels into the port’s ship channel halted transport due to rough seas and will resume after the storm passes, she said.

2018-10-10,"LONDON (Reuters) - British vacuum-cleaner maker Dyson is making a second push into the high-end beauty market with a $500 hair styling tool that it has engineered to create curls, waves and smooth blow dries without extreme heat. The Dyson Airwrap Styler harnesses a phenomenon known as the Coanda effect, whereby a high-speed jet of air attaches itself to a surface, to curl, wave or smooth hair, Dyson said. The company, which was founded by entrepreneur James Dyson in the 1990s to make his revolutionary bagless dual-cyclone vacuum cleaners, is one of Britain’s most successful manufacturing start-ups of the last three decades. It reported an annual profit of more than 801 million pounds ($1.05 billion) last year on 3.5 billion pounds of sales of products like its air purifiers and its battery-powered cleaners.  Dyson entered the hair market two years ago with a dryer powered by one of its digital motors. The Supersonic dryer - which is priced at $399 - had been a “runaway success”, it said. “We have been obsessively manipulating airflow for more than 25 years,” James Dyson said on Wednesday. “Harnessing the power of Dyson’s digital motor we have engineered a unique styling tool which prevents extreme heat damage when styling.” Dyson, which is working on its first electric vehicle, said it had taken six years and 24 million pounds ($31.4 million) to develop the Airwrap Styler. The Airwrap will be available in two variations priced at 399.99 pounds in Britain and $499.99 in the United States, or in one package that includes all accessories for 449.99 pounds or $549.99.
