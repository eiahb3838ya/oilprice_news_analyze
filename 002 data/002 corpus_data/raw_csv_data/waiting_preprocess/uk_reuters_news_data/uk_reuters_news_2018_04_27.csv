2018-04-27,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is likely to propose freezing fuel economy standards from 2020 through 2026, according to three people briefed on the matter, a move likely to spark a fight with California and other states backing tougher vehicle emissions rules. The administration is circulating a draft proposal that would include freezing requirements after 2020 as the preferred alternative, but will include a series of other alternatives, the sources said. The formal proposal is expected to be unveiled in the coming weeks and has not been finalized. The Los Angeles Times first reported the plan earlier Friday. The lengthy draft proposal, led by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), is also expected to assert that a 1975 federal law preempts states from imposing emissions rules, but the administration is not expected to immediately propose revoking California’s waiver under the Clean Air Act to set its own rules. Automakers want changes to address lower gasoline prices and a shift in U.S. consumer preferences to larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles. They want revisions to the Obama standards to make it easier and less costly to meet targets, which vary depending on the size of vehicles and whether they are classified as cars or trucks. The Obama administration’s rules, negotiated with automakers in 2011, were aimed at doubling average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025. The EPA did not comment on Friday but EPA said earlier this month it had determined the fuel rules through 2025 were not appropriate and would propose revisions. NHTSA said Friday it is working with EPA on the proposal. “The agencies intend to take comment on a broad range of options,” the agency said. Senator Tom Carper, a Democrat, said “the Trump Administration is crafting a proposal that is dramatically weaker than any automobile manufacturer has requested and that also deliberately seeks to embark on a legal collision course with the State of California — a scenario that automakers, lawmakers and the state of California have all repeatedly urged the administration to avoid.” President Donald Trump in March 2017 told autoworkers he would revisit the rules, which he suggested were harming auto jobs. “The assault on the American auto industry is over,” he said in Michigan. Earlier this week, two auto trade groups met with White House officials, including Christopher Liddell, a White House deputy chief of staff, to discuss the issue, a Trump administration official confirmed. The White House, California and Transportation Department have held talks for months in an effort to reach agreement on revisions. Automakers, including General Motors Co (GM.N) chief executive Mary Barra and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), have repeatedly urged the Trump administration to try to reach agreement with California to maintain a national program. California Air Resources Board chief Mary Nichols told Reuters earlier this month the state was willing to make changes in the requirements to help automakers comply. Stanley Young, a spokesman for Nichols, said: “If enacted, this would harm people’s health, boost greenhouse gas pollution and force drivers to pay more money at the pump for years.” A group of 12 state attorneys general have threatened to sue if the Trump administration reverses the Obama-era rules. On Friday, nearly two dozen Democratic U.S. senators wrote California and a dozen other states saying they would oppose any effort by the Trump administration to rescind California’s authority to set state vehicle emissions rules, according to a letter reviewed by Reuters. The letter led by Senator Ed Markey and Carper and signed by Senators Charles Schumer, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and others said they “will oppose any unprecedented attack on the California waiver or on its standards.” EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt on Thursday declined to answer if he would call for revoking California’s waiver, but vowed to work “to try to achieve commonality and an answer for both California and those states and our agencies.” Reporting by David Shepardson; editing by Diane Craft",https://uk.reuters.com/article/autos-emissions/update-2-u-s-likely-to-back-freezing-fuel-economy-standards-from-2020-26-sources-idUKL1N1S41Z2,27 Apr 2018,"* Fuel efficiency standards frozen at 2020 levels through

2018-04-27,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.S. President Donald Trump aired differences over trade and NATO on Friday at a White House meeting where they tried to put on a show of warmth and friendship despite tensions between the two allies. With Trump poised to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium soon that will impact European exports, Merkel said the decision is now in Trump’s hands on whether to grant exemptions to European Union nations. “We had an exchange of views. The decision lies with the president,” Merkel told a joint press conference after Trump complained about the U.S.-European trade imbalance, particularly in regards to automobiles. Merkel’s quick trip came the same week as a three-day state visit by French President Emmanuel Macron, who, like Merkel, pressed Trump on trade and urged him to keep the United States in a multi-national nuclear deal with Iran. Neither leader appeared to make significant progress convincing Trump on either issue. Merkel said she could see negotiating a bilateral trade deal between the EU and the United States, saying the World Trade Organization has been unable to deliver multilateral agreements. Trump said he wanted a “reciprocal” trade relationship with Germany and other European nations and wanted Germany and other NATO allies to pay more for their common defence, an issue he has raised repeatedly. “We need a reciprocal relationship, which we don’t have... We’re working on it and we want to make it more fair and the chancellor wants to make it more fair,” Trump said. After their last White House meeting drew attention when the two leaders did not shake hands in the Oval Office, Trump made a point of doing just that, twice, while congratulating the German chancellor on her recent election win. They exchanged kisses on the cheek when she first arrived at the White House. “We have a really great relationship, and we actually have had a great relationship right from the beginning, but some people didn’t understand that,” Trump said in the Oval Office, calling Merkel a “very extraordinary woman.” Merkel acknowledged that it took a while to form a government after heavy election losses to the far-right, but she said it was important to her to make her first trip out of Europe since establishing her administration to Washington. The cautious Merkel has not established a particularly strong personal rapport with the brash Trump, and the mood of her one-day working visit contrasted sharply with the tactile “bromance” between Trump and Macron. Chemistry aside, Merkel was careful to praise Trump’s progress on North Korea while addressing some of his concerns point by point on defence spending, which she said Berlin was increasing, and German cars, many of which she noted were produced in the United States. On the Iran nuclear deal, Merkel said it was a first step that had helped reduce nuclear activities and better monitor them but added: “We Germans think it’s not enough to really ensure Iran takes on a role founded in reliability so more is necessary.”  Macron made the European position on the Iran nuclear deal clear ahead of Merkel’s visit. On Wednesday, he called on the United States not to abandon the Iran deal as Western envoys said Britain, France and Germany were nearing agreeing a package they hope could persuade Trump to save the pact.  Trump will decide by May 12 whether to revive U.S. sanctions on Iran. Doing so would be a serious blow to the nuclear deal, which many Western countries sees as essential for stopping Tehran developing a nuclear bomb.

2018-04-27,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Friday proposed relaxing a rule on offshore oil wells that was finalized after the 2010 BP Plc disaster and crude spill in the Gulf of Mexico, as part of its effort to slash regulations it considers burdensome on industry. The exact revisions to the 2016 well control rule proposed by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), an office of the Department of Interior, will be known next week when they are published in the Federal Register. But the proposed changes will include removing “prescriptive requirements” for real-time monitoring of offshore drilling facilities and allow the oil producers to use company-specific approaches, a BSEE fact sheet said. The proposed revisions will also seek to minimize what BSEE says are duplicative notifications of rig movements that operators are required to send to the agency. In addition, independent third-party groups would be allowed to do some certifications and verifications on parts of blow-out preventers, which seek to stop the uncontrolled releases of crude, according to the fact sheet. The 2010 Macondo disaster killed 11 oil rig workers, was the biggest environmental disaster in U.S. history, and has cost BP about $65 billion.      While drilling interests had pushed the agency to revise the rule, Scott Angelle, the director of BSEE, said in a blog that the agency would never put offshore workers or the environment at greater risk. “At the same time, we are equally dedicated to addressing overly burdensome regulations and, even more so, to amending or eliminating regulations that may decrease safety or increase the chances of environmental harm,” he said. Randall Luthi, the president of National Ocean Industries Association, said changes to the rule would increase efficiency and “do not, in any way, constitute a rollback in offshore safety.”  U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, was concerned the revisions would weaken the offshore regulations. “These rules were put in place to prevent another massive oil spill off our coasts,” he said. “We can’t allow this new administration to take us backwards in time.” The proposal will be published next week and open to a 60-day public comment period.

2018-04-27,"(Reuters) - TransCanada Corp (TRP.TO) on Friday beat profit estimates and said it does not expect major changes in throughput on its Keystone pipeline once pressure restrictions related to a leak in South Dakota are removed. Net income rose to C$734 million, or 83 Canadian cents per share, in the first quarter from C$643 million, or 74 Canadian cents per share, for the same period in 2017. (bit.ly/2r4qjZn) Excluding items, TransCanada earned 98 Canadian cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 14 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Pressure has been restricted on the 590,000 barrel per day Keystone pipeline since late last year, after the line leaked some 9,700 barrels of oil in South Dakota. Canadian producers had hoped a return to full capacity on the line would help relieve a bottleneck in the oil-rich province of Alberta, where increased output has run up against a shortage of pipeline and rail capacity.  The restrictions “really did have a minor impact on our throughput and so consequently, I don’t anticipate seeing a tremendous increase in our throughput once it’s lifted, based on some of the changes we’ve made already,” said TransCanada’s head of liquids Paul Miller on a conference call. Miller also said the company was continuing to work towards starting construction on the Keystone XL expansion in 2019 and that $8 billion remains “a good number” for capital costs. The long-delayed Keystone XL project has pitted environmentalists, who worry about spills, against industry, who say the project will shore up discounted Canadian oil prices and attract investment to Canada’s energy sector. The company also said the LNG Canada liquefied natural gas export project was looking positive following news the company had selected a contractor to lead construction. TransCanada, which is building the pipeline that would connects the export terminal to Canadian gas fields, said the bulk of its capital spending will be in 2021 and 2022, assuming the project goes ahead. The company expects to invest C$21 billion in the near term, down from the C$23 billion it had earmarked earlier. TransCanada said earnings from its oil pipelines, of which Keystone is the biggest contributor, rose 50 percent to C$341 million ($264.90 million) in the first quarter . TransCanada said earnings from its Canadian natural gas pipelines fell 10.2 percent to C$253 million in the reported quarter.  Revenue rose marginally to C$3.42 billion from C$3.41 billion.

2018-04-27,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices edged lower on Friday, although Brent still gained for a third straight week amid supply concerns should the United States reimpose sanctions on Iran. Brent crude futures LCOc1 fell 10 cents, or 0.1 percent, to settle at $74.64 a barrel. This month, the global benchmark hit highs above $75, a level last seen in late 2014.  (Graphic: U.S. oil to retest support at $67.05 - tmsnrt.rs/2KhwbHB) U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell 9 cents to settle at $68.10 a barrel, also a 0.1 percent loss. Brent gained about 0.5 percent this week - its third consecutive weekly gain - while WTI posted a weekly loss of about 0.5 percent. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined futures and options position in U.S. crude in New York and London by 17,021 contracts to 455,885 during the week to April 24, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). (Graphic: Brent oil may end its bounce below $75.45 - tmsnrt.rs/2JsgMmI) U.S. President Donald Trump will decide by May 12 whether to reimpose sanctions on Iran that were lifted as part of an agreement with six other world powers over Tehran’s nuclear program. The renewed sanctions would likely dampen Iranian oil exports, disrupting global oil supply. “That’s the biggest factor right now that’s driving the market. And that’s why you’re seeing low volatility today and for the most part during the week,” Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at energy investment manager Tortoise Capital in Leawood, Kansas.  “The market is just kind of waiting on that.” (Graphic: Global oil inventories relative to demand - reut.rs/2Js9DCI) Brent has risen by around 6 percent so far this month, while WTI was on track for a gain of nearly 5 percent. The gains came despite a higher dollar .DXY, which hit its strongest since Jan. 11 against a basket of currencies. A stronger dollar makes greenback-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies. Concerns about market tightness have also been fuelled by the deteriorating political and economic situation in Venezuela that has led to a 40 percent decline in crude output in the past two years. PRODN-VE  Price increases have been capped by rising U.S. production as shale drillers ramp up activity, underpinning a widening discount between Brent and WTI. U.S. crude’s discount to Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1 hit its widest since Dec. 28 at $6.74 a barrel. Surging U.S. production, which rose to 10.59 million barrels per day last week, has encouraged record-high U.S. exports. U.S. drillers added five oil rigs this week, bringing the total count to 825, the highest level since March 2015, and boosted the overall rig count by 28 this month, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said. RIG-OL-USA-BHI [RIG/U] But while U.S. producers are accelerating shale drilling in areas in the United States, higher production has not necessarily translated into stronger refining results for some oil companies.  Weak refining margins hurt two of the world’s largest integrated energy companies for the second consecutive quarter, although Chevron Corp’s (CVX.N) oil production gains in the first quarter outshone its larger rival Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N).

2018-04-27,"LUANDA (Reuters) - The most powerful body in Angola’s ruling MPLA party said on Friday it had approved the candidacy of state president Joao Lourenco to become head of the party, replacing his predecessor as head of state Jose Eduardo dos Santos. The move coincided with an announcement by Angola’s $5 billion sovereign wealth fund that it was sacking Swiss-based Quantum Global as its asset manager because it was concerned about the way its capital was being invested.   Both developments will further cement the political grip of Lourenco, who has taken action against dos Santos’ allies and removed family members from key positions while pledging to root out endemic corruption and clean up public finances in Africa’s No. 2 crude producer. Dos Santos’ son Jose was formerly head of the fund but has since been removed by Lourenço, who has also overseen the sacking of his daughter Isabel as head of state oil company Sonangol. Lourenco took over as state president in September last year when dos Santos stepped down after almost four decades in power, but the latter remained head of the MPLA, which has ruled Angola since it won independence from Portugal in 1975. The MPLA’s politburo, the highest-ranking organ in the former Marxist party that was aligned to Moscow during the Cold War, said in a statement that it had “approved the candidacy of Comrade João Lourenço, currently Vice-President, to the position of MPLA President.” The next MPLA president will be formally appointed at a party congress in September.   Dos Santos’ position as head of the party was widely regarded as an attempt to maintain control of the state but Lourenço has shown he is in charge. The action against Quantum Global follows this pattern as the new administration seeks to weed out the influence of dos Sanstos’ appointees in a bid to woo investors and key lenders. Angola’s sovereign wealth fund FSDEA said in a statement that it had “great concerns about Quantum Global’s approach to investment of the FSDEA funds.” “As a consequence of investigations through leading international global consultants and advisers, FSDEA is taking steps to remove Quantum as its asset manager,” it added.  Quantum Global said all Angola’s money under its management was accounted for and that the dispute was a contractual issue. QG was appointed in 2012, with most investments made in 2015. Friday’s announcement comes just weeks after Mauritius froze bank accounts and suspended business licences linked to QG Investments Africa Management following a visit by Angolan officials. QG Investments Africa Management, which said it was cooperating with authorities in Mauritius, is run by Jean-Claude Bastos de Morais, QG founder and group chairman and a business partner of dos Santos’ son. Quantum Global has demanded that Mauritius authorities explain their decision to suspend its business licenses on the Indian Ocean island nation.

2018-04-27,"(Updates with closing prices, adds details) By Mark Weinraub CHICAGO, April 27 (Reuters) - Chicago Board of Trade soybean futures jumped 1.7 percent on Friday, their fourth straight day of gains, on expectations that the United States will boost its share of the soymeal export market due to harvest shortfalls in Argentina, traders said. Corn futures firmed, hitting a nine-month high for the third day as traders scrambled to cover short positions ahead of the weekend. Corn has risen for four of the last five days amid incessant planting delays in the U.S. Midwest. Gains in wheat also stemmed from short-covering as traders squared positions ahead of a tour through Kansas next week that will allow crop scouts to get a first-hand look at damage caused by a drought. CBOT July soybean futures were up 16-3/4 cents at $10.56-1/4 a bushel. Soymeal futures were 2.8 percent higher and hit their highest since March 2. “Soybean prices continue to steer clear of modestly lower price levels where a dangerous minefield of momentum triggers await,” said Tobin Gorey, director of agricultural strategy at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. On the cash market, bids for soymeal shipped by barge to exporters at the U.S. Gulf firmed early on Friday. Premiums for soymeal loaded on ocean-going vessels also were strong. “It is the meal leading the rally,” said Dan Cekander, president of DC Analysis. “There is just a feeling that the drought in Argentina will cut back on their meal processing. That tightness has not been resolved.” CBOT July soft red winter wheat futures were 9 cents higher at $4.98-1/2 a bushel while K.C. hard red winter wheat for July delivery gained 9-1/2 cents to $5.30-1/2 a bushel. CBOT July corn was 3-1/4 cents higher at $3.98-1/2 a bushel. Prices peaked at $3.99 a bushel, the highest for the most-active contract since July 21. Gains in the corn market were kept in check by forecasts for warmer weather in the U.S. Midwest that should allow farmers to make headway in their much delayed planting tasks in the coming days. “Temperatures will gradually rise across the core U.S. crop regions through the end of the month under high pressure dominance,” Ed Whalen of Thomson Reuters Weather Research said in a report issued on Thursday. He said rainfall would be “rather limited” in that region.

Strength in the Chevron division that pumps oil and gas helped overcome the refining weakness and beat Wall Street profit expectations for the quarter.

Both companies have sought to bolster refining operations. Reuters reported earlier this month that they have asked U.S. regulators for exemptions to U.S. biofuels rules that are typically only given to small companies in financial distress. Both companies said they are accelerating shale drilling in the Permian Basin of west Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield, helping to lift the nation’s output so far this year to more than 10 million barrels per day, a new record.

Only one person injured in the blast remained in Essentia-St Mary’s Medical Center in Duluth, Minnesota, a hospital spokeswoman said on Friday. The person was listed in good condition. “All indications are that the refinery site is safe and stable and the air quality is clean and normal,” Superior Mayor Jim Paine said on Facebook. The city of about 27,000 people lifted the evacuation order as of 6 a.m. local time (1100 GMT). It was too early to determine the cause of the blasts or the extent of damage to refinery production units at the site, which employs about 165 people, Guttormson said. Fifteen other people who were treated for blast-related injuries have been released from Essentia Health hospitals, the hospital spokeswoman said. Melissa Burlaga, a spokeswoman for St. Luke’s, a healthcare system in nearby Duluth, Minnesota, said four people were treated and released on Thursday. The cause of the explosion was not clear. After an initial blaze was extinguished, a storage tank was punctured, and a second fire erupted. Thick black smoke billowed from the facility and hung over Superior throughout the day on Thursday, forcing tens of thousands to flee homes and businesses. Friday classes were canceled in Superior and nearby Maple school districts. The refinery had additional workers on site preparing for a plant-wide overhaul when the blast occurred, Husky said. It produces asphalt, gasoline, diesel and heavy fuel oils, largely using heavy crude oil imported from Canada. The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board sent a four-person team to investigate the blasts. The non-regulatory federal agency investigates serious chemical accidents such as refinery fires. Husky purchased the refinery from Calumet Specialty Products Partners LP last year.

2018-04-27,"(Reuters) - Canada’s Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO.TO) on Friday reported a 55 percent jump in quarterly profit, helped by strength in its refining and chemicals businesses, and the company boosted its dividend and repurchase program. The company’s shares rose as much as 4.5 percent to C$40.47. Desjardins analyst Justin Bouchard called the dividend hike a “pleasant surprise”, as it was almost double his estimate. Imperial raised its quarterly dividend to 19 Canadian cents from 16 Canadian cents per share and the number of shares that may be repurchased to up to 5 percent of the outstanding float, from 3 percent. The buyback increase was a positive move, showing confidence in the cash flow generating ability of the company, Bouchard said. Imperial’s net income soared to C$516 million ($402 million), or 62 Canadian cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31. The results come at a time when constraints related to the export of Canadian heavy crude due to a lack of pipeline capacity and delays in shipping by rail have weighed on the industry. “We had accounted for the pricing and transportation issues plaguing everyone in the industry. It was the downstream and chemicals that were the surprise, that outperformed versus our numbers,” Bouchard said. Oil sands producer Cenovus (CVE.TO) posted a first-quarter loss, hurt by shipping bottlenecks on Wednesday. Low oil prices and a slow ramp up at its offshore Indonesia project saw Husky Energy (HSE.TO) cut its 2018 production on Thursday. Imperial, which is majority owned by Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), said total revenue and other income rose about 11 percent to C$7.93 billion. The oil producer and refiner’s production fell to 370,000 gross oil-equivalent barrels per day from 378,000 a year earlier due to lower volumes at its Cold Lake oil sands project in northeastern Alberta. However, the company’s income from refining rose about 37 percent to C$521 million.

2018-04-27,"BONN, Germany, April 27 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - M ozambique not only has one of Africa’s longest coastlines; it is also the final destination for at least nine transnational rivers. That makes it a hostage to geography, says Manuel de Araujo, the mayor of Quelimane, a port city of 450,000 people that lies about 1,000 kilometres (623 miles) north of the capital Maputo. The fact that 60 percent of the country’s population lives along the coast adds to the challenges of managing climate change, he said in Bonn on Friday at an international conference on building resilient cities. With frequent extreme weather threatening the delicate urban balance of Quelimane - most of which lies below sea-level - the population is extremely vulnerable to climate risks, he said. “The city is easily flooded both from rain and from marine floods and tides - sometimes they all happen at the same time,” he said. In Quelimane, one solution involves restoring hectares of mangroves, which act as a nature-based solution against flooding, helping to stem the tide by preventing soil erosion. “Mangroves are our first line of defence,” Araujo said of the scheme, which is supported by the U.S. development agency USAID. The project has a social dimension too: mangrove nurseries are planted in the poorest parts of the city, where residents, particularly women, manage and conserve the young plants. High levels of poverty meant people were used to cutting down mangroves for cooking or building, he said. But working with schools and religious leaders, and putting out a conservation message in the local language via radio, means the community now knows to protect mangroves. “There is a political buy-in given that community members and leaders are involved in all stages of the restoration process,” he said. “This is very important as it brings ownership to the people.” A further 670 kilometres northeast of Quelimane is the popular tourist city of Pemba. Its mayor, Tagir Carimo, said nearly one-third of the city is vulnerable to climate threats such as flooding and soil erosion. On the very day that Carimo was sworn in as mayor, Pemba was pummelled by heavy rain and flooding, the consequences of which he is still fixing. One major effort by his city has been to use satellite imagery and local knowledge to map parcels of land and neighbourhoods at higher risks of climate effects, such as flooding, he told the conference in Bonn. “The main gains are that from (maps) we can see properly what type of land we can use and advise people on which kinds of materials they should use to build houses, roads and so on,” he said. Whether building climate-proof homes or city-wide drainage systems, he said, the population now feels more secure knowing that they are developing land in safe or low-risk areas. Mozambique is one of the world’s poorest countries, with an average life expectancy of 58, according to the World Bank. That makes it ill-equipped to fund adaptation to climate threats, said Carimo. “The main difficulty is how to provide long-term finance,” Carimo told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, particularly when short-term survival often seems more pressing. However, Araujo noted, the two might soon merge: disasters cost Mozambique between 1 and 5 percent of GDP annually, with that figure set to rise due to climate change, he said. Given the country's growing population and increased migration to its coastal cities, both mayors said a shift in mindset was needed from funders to allow climate change adaption and development to go hand-in-hand.

2018-04-27,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican state-run oil company Pemex said on Friday its net profit rose 29 percent in the first quarter compared with the year-earlier quarter, helped by higher crude prices and currency movements. The company [PEMX.UL], one of the largest in Latin America, reported a profit of 113.3 billion pesos ($6.2 billion) in the first three months of the year. Revenue rose 14 percent to 397.4 billion pesos. Pemex said the company benefited from growing crude prices, which rose to $56.42 from $44.15 in the quarter, helping push export sales up 23.8 percent. Sales in Mexico, particularly gasoline and diesel, also rose 9.2 percent due to higher prices. Mexico’s peso also strengthened more than 7 percent against the dollar in the first quarter. In a subsequent conference call with analysts on Friday, executives said Pemex expects to process around 1 million barrels per day (bpd) domestically toward the end of this year, and that the company processed an average of 598,000 bpd in the first quarter of 2018. Pemex executives also told analysts the troubled Salina Cruz refinery in southern Mexico was processing 243,800 bpd at the end of March. President Enrique Pena Nieto’s government enacted a wide-ranging reform in 2013-2014 to encourage foreign energy investment and boost the slackening oil output, ending Pemex’s monopoly in the sector.

2018-04-27,"CARACAS (Reuters) - A grace period on Chinese loans to Venezuela has lapsed, according to two Venezuelan sources with knowledge of the matter, potentially depriving the cash-strapped OPEC nation of billions of dollars in desperately needed oil revenue this year. China eased the payment terms two years ago on some $19 billion (14 billion pounds) in oil-for-loan deals, under which Venezuela sends shipments of crude oil and fuel to pay off debt, allowing Venezuela to make interest-only payments. The favorable conditions from Beijing helped President Nicolas Maduro’s socialist government weather a collapse in Venezuela’s economy, which slid into hyperinflation and a painful recession following a downturn in oil prices. But the grace period has lapsed without a renewal in recent weeks, according to the sources, who have been briefed by Chinese and Venezuelan officials. That could deprive Venezuela of some $7 billion in annual revenue, according to a Reuters’ estimate based on current oil prices, a crippling blow to a country already struggling to import basic goods like food and medicine.  The sources, who asked not to be identified, said that Venezuela continues to press for an extension but is responsible for making the full payments while the talks continue. The sharply increased payments would absorb roughly an additional 305,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuela’s oil production, which has fallen to a 33-year low this year. State oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA’s (PDVSA) deteriorating infrastructure and cash flow have caused oil production to plunge 33 percent in a year, to 1.51 million bpd in March, according to official data reported to OPEC.      “China maintains its position of not increasing its exposure to Venezuela and is adjusting conditions, given that the price of oil is now $20 per barrel above its level when the (grace period) was created,” said one of the sources. Neither Venezuela’s Information Ministry nor state oil company PDVSA responded to requests for comment.  China Development Bank, which has underwritten most of the loans to Venezuela, did not respond to a request for comment.  China’s Foreign Ministry, asked about the negotiations, said that cooperation was proceeding smoothly and the loan contracts were in accord with international standards. Caracas could seek to preserve cash flow by sending those barrels to other clients who pay cash, defaulting on its obligations to China in the process and straining ties with a crucial political ally and its largest financier.  Beijing would have little incentive to pursue an embarrassing commercial dispute with a government it supported for years, and may simply turn a blind eye to a default. Maduro, who is up for re-election on May 20, says his country is victim of an “economic war” led by his political adversaries with the help of Washington.  His critics say the country’s plight is the result of a dysfunctional state-led economic model. China for a decade courted the government of then-President Hugo Chavez with generous financing arrangements as it sought to secure oil supplies for its resource-hungry economy and cultivate an anti-Washington ally in Latin America.  It extended more than $50 billion in credit to Venezuela over 10 years. However, Beijing stopped renewing loans three years ago as Venezuela’s economy began spiraling downward as a result of the crash of oil prices.  Last year, Venezuela shipped some 700,000 bpd of crude and fuel to China through bilateral agreements, according to a Reuters review of PDVSA trade documents. But only around 70,000 bpd were applied to debt service under the grace period arrangement, according to one of the sources, with China paying the remainder in cash. Without the grace period, the amount applied to debt service rises to 375,000 bpd, the sources said. Venezuela and PDVSA are in default on nearly $50 billion in international bonds because they have failed to make more than $2 billion in interest payments. Bondholders have yet to take legal action, in part because most believe Maduro is unwilling to make changes to revive the economy, and because U.S. sanctions effectively block them from buying any newly issued Venezuelan bonds, making a restructuring practically impossible. PDVSA also has hundreds of millions of dollars in outstanding bills to suppliers and partners. Italian energy company Eni (ENI.MI) said on Friday that PDVSA’s debt had risen to 650 million euros ($787 million) from 600 million euros in February and that payments were “near zero.”  ($1 = 0.8262 euros) Reporting by Corina Pons, additional reporting by Marianna Parraga in Houston, Ben Blanchard in Beijing, and Engen Tham in Shanghai, writing by Brian Ellsworth; Editing by Daniel Flynn and Rosalba O'Brien",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-china/exclusive-venezuela-faces-heavy-bill-as-grace-period-lapses-on-china-loans-sources-idUKL1N1S226P,27 Apr 2018,"A grace period on Chinese

2018-04-27,"YEREVAN (Reuters) - Armenia’s acting prime minister, Karen Karapetyan, rejected a proposal by opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan to hold talks on Friday to defuse a political crisis engulfing the small South Caucasus nation. Armenia, a close ally of Russia, has been rocked by two weeks of anti-government protests against the ruling elite which led on Monday to the resignation of Serzh Sarksyan as prime minister. Sarksyan had previously been president for a decade. His resignation has failed to halt the protesters, who say they consider the whole government tainted by Sarksyan’s drive to shift power to the prime minister from the president. They want Pashinyan installed as interim premier and then for early parliamentary polls to take place under a new election law. “The acting prime minister considers taking part in ‘talks’ that have no chance of finding a solution to be useless,” Karapetyan’s press service said in a statement. Karapetyan is an ally of Sarksyan and a member of his ruling Republican Party. Karapetyan later accused the opposition of “monopolising the political process” and said only genuine dialogue and an acknowledgement of mistakes could defuse the crisis. “We should understand which political force or forces will lead the country to a better future,” Karapetyan told independent television channel Shant TV. “We should support a programme rather than just elect a personality.” Pashinyan, who has led the daily street protests, said Karapetyan was repeating Sarksyan’s mistakes and said the demonstrations would continue. Protesters held a rally on Friday in Gyumri, Armenia’s second biggest city, and plan to hold another outside the capital on Saturday before resuming protests in Yerevan from Sunday. Thousands of people greeted Pashinyan’s cortege and chanted his name along the road from Yerevan to Gyumri. In some villages he met local residents who hugged and kissed the former journalist turned lawmaker. Pashinyan said the opposition would probably boycott any snap parliamentary election unless parliament made him the interim prime minister. “We want a guarantee that such an election would be really free, really transparent and really democratic,” Pashinyan said. “Otherwise this vote would not have any meaning.”     “I’m calling on the citizens of Armenia to go out to the streets from early morning on May 1 and to flood all streets and squares, including around the National Assembly (parliament),” Pashinyan added. Parliament is due to pick a new prime minister on May 1. Although the anti-government demonstrations have been peaceful, the upheaval has threatened to destabilise Armenia in a volatile region riven by the country’s decades-long, low-level conflict with neighbouring Azerbaijan. Pashinyan has not questioned Armenia’s geopolitical alignment with Russia under Sarksyan and his criticism has focussed on domestic issues such as corruption and poverty.     On Friday, the Kremlin said it hoped the political crisis in Armenia could be resolved as promptly as possible and with the consensus of all parties involved. Moscow has two military bases in the ex-Soviet republic. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on Thursday to Karapetyan, a former executive of Russian gas giant Gazprom, and made clear that Moscow was watching events closely and did not want mob rule in Armenia, the Kremlin said. The Kremlin statement appeared to suggest that Putin wanted Armenia’s next prime minister to come from the ruling party, which has been the focus of popular anger, saying he thought the crisis needed to be addressed on the basis of what he said were legitimate parliamentary elections in 2017. One Yerevan-based political analyst said the Kremlin had clearly endorsed Karapetyan as its preferred candidate to head the next government. “It is a direct challenge to the opposition and a move to safeguard the position of the embattled and deeply unpopular ruling elite. It is also a flagrant rejection of the new political reality in Armenia,” Richard Giragosian, director at Yereban-based Regional Studies Centre, told Reuters Additional reporting by Margarita Antidze; Writing by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber and Margarita Antidze; Editing by Gareth Jones",https://uk.reuters.com/article/armenia-politics/update-3-acting-armenian-pm-rejects-talks-with-opposition-leader-protests-persist-idUKL8N1S4269,27 Apr 2018,"* Armenia's ally Russia urges swift resolution of crisis

2018-04-27,"FRANKFURT/PRAGUE (Reuters) - Investment group KKCG plans to bid for the Czech assets of German energy group Innogy (IGY.DE), posing a new challenge to a deal between Innogy’s majority owner RWE (RWEG.DE) and rival German utility E.ON to carve up Innogy themselves. E.ON (EONGn.DE) on Friday published its 5.2 billion euro (4.6 billion pound) takeover offer for the 23.2 percent of Innogy that RWE does not own, worth 40 euros per share including dividend payments to Innogy shareholders for 2017 and 2018. Shareholders have until July 6 to accept the offer. RWE and E.ON in March unveiled comprehensive plans to break up Innogy and divide its assets, turning RWE into Europe’s second-largest wind utility and E.ON into Europe’s largest operator of gas and power networks. But other investors are looking to muscle in on the deal.  Last week, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Australia’s Macquarie (MQG.AX) was interested in buying some of Innogy’s assets, including the stake in a Czech gas networks unit it does not already own. On Friday, Czech investment group KKCG, which has interests in gas extraction and storage, said it also planned to make a bid for Innogy’s Czech assets, which include a gas distribution network, storage facilities and gas and electricity trading.  KKCG said that needn’t disrupt RWE’s and E.ON’s plans. “A potential sale of Innogy’s Czech activities is in line with an earlier agreement ... on the split of Innogy that the parent RWE concluded last month with its competitor E.ON,” KKCG said in a statement. However, RWE and E.ON don’t seem keen on any side deals.  E.ON said in its offer document that RWE would offer to buy Innogy’s stake in Czech Innogy Grid Holding, which E.ON would then have an option to buy. And E.ON’s finance chief told Reuters he believed his firm would  end up owning the Czech operations. “We are very interested in integrating Innogy in its entirety. And that includes the Czech gas business. I am confident that the Czech gas business will eventually find its way to E.ON. Provisions have been made in our contracts for this,” Marc Spieker told Reuters. Innogy and E.ON declined to comment on KKCG’s statement. Innogy’s management and supervisory boards will publish their recommendations on E.ON’s offer within the next two weeks. They have urged shareholders not to take any action until then. Innogy’s shares closed little changed at 36.28 euros.

2018-04-27,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian sanctions-hit businessman Oleg Deripaska has agreed in principle to reduce his stake in Russia’s En+ Group (ENPLq.L), which manages his aluminum and hydropower assets, to less than 50 percent, the company said in a statement on Friday. Washington imposed sweeping sanctions on some of Russia’s biggest companies and businessmen on April 6, striking at allies of President Vladimir Putin to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and other so-called malign activities. En+, along with Deripaska, who currently has a 65 percent stake in the company, and aluminum giant Rusal (0486.HK), in which En+ owns a 48 percent stake, were all hit with sanctions. “Following a series of discussions with the Company’s independent chairman, Lord Barker of Battle, Mr Oleg Deripaska has agreed in principle to the chairman’s request that Mr Deripaska reduce his shareholding in the company to below 50 percent,” En+ said in the statement. Earlier this week, the United States said it could remove Rusal from the list if Deripaska ceded control. Deripaska also agreed with the chairman’s proposal that he will resign from the board and consent to the appointment of some new directors so that the board will have a majority of new independent directors, it added. En+ also said that it asked the United States for an extension of the deadline for operations with En+’s debt, equity, or other holdings from the current May 7 to October 31 or another appropriate date. Without the extension, En+’s ability to maintain its listing in London will be materially impacted, it added.

On Thursday, 10 aid workers went missing in Yei in Central Equatoria region, the latest incident involving relief staff in the war-ridden country. David Shearer, Special Representative of the U.N. Secretary-General, said there were increased clashes in Unity, Jonglei and Central Equatorias states. He pointed out the towns of Nhialdiu, Mayendit, Rupchai, Thaker, and Mirinyal near Leer and Bentiu in the Unity region, and Motot and Akobo in Jonglei, as the worst affected. “Innocent civilians are being caught in the crossfire, including many women, children and elderly people,” Shearer said in a statement. “Our teams on the ground are reporting incidents of killing, sexual violence, homes being burnt to the ground, cattle raiding, and the looting of hospitals and schools.” Shearer said in one instance overnight from Thursday to Friday, there was gunfire near an UNMISS temporary peacekeeping operating base at Leer. South Sudan, which won independence from Sudan in 2011 and is the world’s youngest nation, has been in a civil war since 2013 when President Salva Kiir fired his deputy Riek Machar. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in a conflict that has often taken ethnic lines, and much of the nation has suffered dire food shortages. Both rebels and government forces stand accused of targeting humanitarian workers and sometimes blocking access to relief and hijacking food and other aid. Shearer said over 30 humanitarian workers have been relocated in the past two weeks as it had become too dangerous for them to work in an environment of increase violence that had forced thousands of people to flee into swamps and bushes, depriving them of food, clean water and medical care.

2018-04-27,"* U.S. stocks little changed after GDP data * Dollar hits highest level since Jan 11 * Sterling hits lowest since March 1 as Britain’s economy slows (Updates with U.S. markets, changes dateline; previous LONDON) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters) - A gauge of world stocks edged higher on Friday, buoyed by gains in Amazon as yields on U.S. Treasuries dipped for a second straight day in the wake of data on the strength of the economy. U.S. stocks were unable to hold initial gains and held near the unchanged mark. After rising nearly 8 percent, Amazon.com Inc shares pulled back and were last up 4.85 percent after its quarterly earnings report. The energy sector, off 1.23 percent, was weighed down by a 3.49-percent drop in Exxon Mobil Corp. The world’s largest publicly traded oil producer posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit as weakness in its chemical and refining operations offset a boost from higher crude prices. “The market is a little hesitant after a very strong day in response to some earnings that were taken quite positively,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. U.S. stocks had rallied on Thursday, with each of the major Wall Street indexes climbing more than 1 percent with strong gains in tech shares. Still, the S&P 500 was on track for a modest weekly decline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 49.15 points, or 0.2 percent, to 24,273.19, the S&P 500 gained 0.19 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,667.13 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.29 points, or 0.02 percent, to 7,119.96. European shares pulled back from earlier highs but were still on track for their fifth straight weekly climb. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.08 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.22 percent. Yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield declined for a second straight day after hitting a four-year high earlier in the week. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 9/32 in price to yield 2.9587 percent, from 2.99 percent late on Thursday. But the margin between U.S. shorter-dated Treasury yields and longer-dated ones shrank as a smaller-than-expected decline in domestic economic growth in the first quarter renewed bets the Federal Reserve would stick to its rate-hike campaign to keep inflation in check. The U.S. economy slowed in the first quarter to a 2.3 percent annual rate as consumer spending grew at its weakest pace in nearly five years, but the setback is likely temporary against the backdrop of a tightening labor market and large fiscal stimulus. The dollar held steady after the GDP data, putting the greenback on track for its best week since November 2016. The solid week has lifted the currency to its highest level since January 11. The dollar index rose 0.05 percent, with the euro up 0.07 percent to $1.2109. Sterling slumped to its lowest since March 1 against the dollar. Data showed Britain’s economy slowed much more sharply than expected in the first quarter of 2018, slashing market expectations of a Bank of England rate hike in May. Sterling was last trading at $1.3794, down 0.86 percent on the day. Additional reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru

The deal is expected to cost 7-10 billion euros ($9-12 billion). Possible candidates include Saab’s Gripen, Dassault’s Rafale, Boeing’s Super Hornet, Lockheed Martin’s F-35 and the Eurofighter, a joint project by Airbus, BAE and Leonardo. “If we want to keep defending the entire Finnish territory in a credible way, this is a necessity, especially as we do not belong to a military alliance,” defence minister Jussi Niinisto told a news conference. He said performance of the jets would be the main criterion and Finland was committed to thorough talks with all plane makers. U.S. President Donald Trump suggested last year that Finland had already chosen Hornets, made by U.S. group Boeing, but Finland denied that. Helsinki is asking manufacturers to provide price quotations for the new jets by early 2019, and plans to make the final decision in 2021.

2018-04-27,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany has granted approval for offshore wind parks capable of generating 1,610 megawatts (MW) of power at contract prices above the unexpectedly low bids in an auction a year ago. The total amount of electricity that could be produced by the parks approved on Friday equates to the power generated by one large nuclear power station, or two big coal- or gas-fired power plants. Offshore wind costs have fallen sharply around the North Sea as the industry develops, with turbines of 10 to 15 MW size due to be delivered in the next decade, able to offer twice today’s performance. Proximity to existing construction and maintenance hubs and to onshore connections is also allowing more economies of scale. In the industry’s infancy, operators secured sky-high support payments for years, as there was little experience of installing turbines far out at sea. Six projects were granted licenses for construction at an average 4.66 euro cents per kilowatt hour (kWh), compared with an average 0.44 euro cents in the first auction a year ago, the Bundesnetzagentur network agency said. This auction wraps up two rounds for a total 3,100 MW of projects applied for before Aug. 1, 2016, after which new projects became subject to reforms to the offshore subsidy scheme. While the industry has cut costs sharply in recent years, last year’s results were widely viewed as overly optimistic. Bundesnetzagentur President Jochen Homann said on Friday this year’s result reflected a changed competitive situation, but noted the range of bids made by would-be operators again included some not seeking a subsidy, without giving details. The range was between zero and 9.83 cents for the six projects, three of which are in the Baltic Sea and three in the North Sea. Germany’s Innogy said it had been awarded the rights to build and operate the 325 MW Kaskasi wind farm in the North Sea.  Denmark’s Orsted, formerly Dong, said it won approval for two bids of a joint 551.75 MW in the North Sea. The other winning companies were Iberdrola’s German branch, KNK Wind and Baltic Eagle.     The operators rely on expected wholesale power price revenue for the time that the offshore wind capacity starts operating plus the auction price awarded, to achieve profitability. The winners get an option to build the wind parks between 2021 and 2025, at the price they were awarded, or pay penalties. They also gain the right to onshore connections and operation rights for 25 years. German thermal operators currently obtain 3.8 cents a kWh in the wholesale market for power delivery next year while end-users of electricity pay around 30 cents/kWh, due to a high share of taxes and fees. Last year, Orsted and EnBW won a total 1,490 MW of capacity permits for 2024/25, pledging to build 1,380 MW of the total at zero subsidy. The next auction round will be held in 2021 for capacity after 2026.

2018-04-27,"(Repeats without changes to text) By Brendan O’Brien MILWAUKEE, Wis., April 27 (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of residents of a northern Wisconsin city were cleared to return to their homes on Friday, the day after a blast at a Husky Energy Inc refinery injured at least 15 people, a local official said. Investigators searched for the cause of the massive Thursday morning explosion at the refinery, capable of processing up to 38,000 barrels of oil a day, which shook the city of Superior, Wisconsin, home to about 27,000 people. “All indications are that the refinery site is safe and stable and the air quality is clean and normal,” Superior Mayor Jim Paine said in a Facebook posting, noting that the evacuation order was lifted as of 6 a.m. local time (1100 GMT). “Welcome home.” At least 15 people were injured, local media reported, and at least 10 people - one seriously injured - were taken to area hospitals, said a spokeswoman for Essentia Health-St. Mary’s Medical Center, which operates hospitals in Superior and nearby Duluth, Minnesota. What ignited the blast was not clear. After an initial blaze was extinguished, a storage tank was punctured, and a second fire erupted, Husky Energy spokesman Mel Duvall said. Another tank caught fire at 3:15 p.m., a local ABC affiliate reported, citing Douglas County authorities. “Our focus in the days ahead will turn to the investigation and understanding the root cause of the incident,” Husky Energy said in a late Thursday Twitter post. Thick black smoke billowed from the facility and hung over Superior throughout the day on Thursday, forcing tens of thousands to flee homes and businesses. Friday classes were canceled in Superior and nearby Maple school districts. There were no reports of fatalities, and all of the refinery’s workers have been accounted for, Husky Energy’s Duvall said. The refinery had additional workers on site preparing for a plant-wide overhaul when the blast occurred, he said. It produces asphalt, gasoline, diesel and heavy fuel oils, largely using heavy crude oil imported from Canada. The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board has sent a four-person team to investigate. The non-regulatory federal agency investigates serious chemical accidents such as refinery fires. Husky purchased the refinery from Calumet Specialty Products Partners LP last year.

2018-04-27,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2Kkn74M By John Kemp LONDON, April 27 (Reuters) - The oil market is becoming extremely tight as consumption outstrips production, and traders expect it to tighten even further over the next six months. The balance between production, consumption and inventories is intimately connected with the shape of the oil futures curve (tmsnrt.rs/2Kkn74M). If consumption is expected to exceed production, and inventories are already low and falling, spot prices tend to trade at a premium to forward prices. The premium for spot prices over forward prices, known as backwardation, acts as a signal to conserve remaining stocks as much as possible. The premium for spot prices is intended to boost supply in the short term while encouraging consumers to defer purchases. Backwardation is the most important and reliable signal of a tight and tightening oil market. Front-month Brent futures have recently been trading in a backwardation of more than $3.40 per barrel over the seventh-month contract. The current backwardation in Brent is among the most extreme in the last quarter of a century and in the 91st percentile of all trading days since 1992. If the backwardation was confined mostly to one or two months, it could be dismissed as an aberration or a sign of market manipulation. But big backwardations are evident for all months through 2018 and 2019. The increasing backwardation is consistent with statistics from the physical market showing oil inventories are becoming increasingly tight. Stocks of crude oil and refined products in the OECD industrialised countries have fallen to just 43 million barrels above the five-year average, from a surplus of 340 million barrels at the start of 2017. If OECD stocks are adjusted for the rise in consumption, current inventories are now below the five-year average. Stocks are expected to decline even further in the second half of the year, which traditionally sees higher consumption. Global oil consumption is expected to rise by more than 1.5 million barrels per day in 2018, mostly as a result of strong economic growth. Production from Venezuela is already falling. Traders are concerned about further output declines if the United States imposes sanctions on Venezuela and/or Iran. OPEC members have indicated they will not increase output before the end of the year, which will tighten the market further. The oil market is currently on an unsustainable trajectory, with global demand growth systematically outrunning supply. If something cannot continue forever, it will stop, according to Stein’s Law, one of the most fundamental constraints in economics, popularised by Herbert Stein, the chief economic adviser to President Richard Nixon. Logically, there are five ways in which the oil market can be moved off its currently unsustainable course and brought back towards balance: (1) Slower consumption growth (in response to higher prices, an economic slowdown, or a combination of both) (2) OPEC and its allies lift their output (3) Supply disruptions (existing and threatened) ease (4) U.S. shale output increases even faster than expected (5) Non-OPEC non-shale output increases faster than predicted. The most likely path to rebalancing of the oil market is likely to involve a combination of some or all of these factors. Global consumption is sensitive to price changes, albeit the response tends to be slow at first before accelerating later, and is notoriously slow to appear in the statistics. The relationship between prices and consumption is highly non-linear. The higher prices rise and the longer they are expected to stay high the bigger the eventual response from oil consumers. Experience suggests by the time “demand destruction” is evident in the data, the oil market will be well on its way to the next slump (this was true in 2007/08 and again in 2013/14). Some of the actual and anticipated supply disruptions may ease, especially if the rise in oil prices causes the United States to hesitate before imposing tough sanctions on Venezuela and Iran or to leave loopholes. U.S. shale output is likely to accelerate further in the second half of 2018 and into 2019: the number of rigs drilling for oil is rising again in response to the increase in prices. Escalating prices should also filter through into increasing exploration, production and development in the non-OPEC, non-shale sector. Finally, OPEC and its allies may decide to start lifting their production, via a formal decision or a decrease in compliance, before the end of 2018. The oil market is already tight and on track to get tighter. The backwardation is high and could rise even further. But experience suggests such large imbalances between production, consumption and inventories are not stable for long. Something will have to give soon. Supply. Demand. Or both.

GE (GE.N) said last week it might be able to announce a deal by mid-year for the unit, which includes the reciprocating gas engines makers GE Jenbacher and Waukesha. Besides Wartsila (WRT1V.HE) and Cummins (CMI.N), buyout groups Advent, Bain, CVC, KKR (KKR.N) and B&C Holding have made it to the second round of the auction, the people said.  One of the people said that, before final bids, the suitors may be asked for confirmatory offers in a couple of weeks.  All of the companies mentioned declined to comment.  GE Chief Executive Officer John Flannery, who took the helm  last summer, reiterated last week he was open to breaking up the company and said a spin-off of any of its units, which include power, healthcare and aviation, was a possibility.  GE has said it expects to book as much as $10 billion in proceeds from divesting industrial assets this year.    Selling the industrial gas engine business would help streamline GE’s power division, whose profit plunged last year as sales of power plants and services fell sharply. The unit for sale makes multi-ton gas turbines that generate on-site power to keep industrial plants running. Jenbacher and Waukesha engines cover the small to mid-sized segment of GE’s power business, ranging from 100 kilowatts to 10 megawatts. The unit is expected to post earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of about 250 million euros this year and  to be valued at 12-13 times that in a potential deal, the sources said. Jenbacher has its roots and large production facilities in Austria and was acquired by GE in 2003, while Waukesha, founded in 1906 in Wisconsin as a maker of engines for trucks and tractors, has been part of GE since 2010.

The firm said all Angola’s money under its management was accounted for and that the dispute was a contractual issue. QG was appointed in 2012, with most investments made in 2015. “FSDEA has great concerns about Quantum Global’s approach to investment of the FSDEA funds, as it believes that is not fully aligned with the principles for which the FSDEA was established,” it said in a statement. “As a consequence of investigations through leading international global consultants and advisers, FSDEA is taking steps to remove Quantum as its asset manager,” it added. Quantum Global said any moves could result in losses from the investments. “Any hasty move to withdraw these funds or wind down the funds would run counter to existing contractual arrangements and would lead to a significant loss of value because many of these projects are in the early phase of development,” it said in a statement. The Zurich-based firm said it looked forward to resolving the situation with the FSDEA in an amicable manner. Since he succeeded longtime leader Jose Eduardo dos Santos last September, President Joao Lourenco has Lourenço has moved against a number of dos Santos allies and removed family members from key positions. They include his daughter Isabel from the state oil company Sonangol and his son José Filomeno from the sovereign wealth fund. Friday’s announcement comes just weeks after Mauritius froze bank accounts and suspended business licences linked to QG Investments Africa Management following a visit by Angolan officials. QG Investments Africa Management, which said it was cooperating with authorities in Mauritius, is run by Jean-Claude Bastos de Morais, QG founder and group chairman and a business partner of Jose Filomeno dos Santos.

2018-04-27,"(Reuters) - Indian oil-to-retail conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd said on Friday its telecoms business Jio reported its second straight quarterly net profit since its launch nearly two years ago, as its cut-price plans continue to attract subscribers. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd triggered a fierce price war among operators as they slashed prices to rival Jio’s low-cost data plans, which has driven down margins and forced consolidation in India’s telecom industry. Jio made a profit of 5.10 billion rupees ($76.43 million) in the quarter ended March 31, compared with a profit of 5.04 billion rupees in the previous quarter.  Profit on a standalone basis - which comprises Reliance’s refining, petrochemicals and oil and gas exploration businesses - rose 6.7 percent to a record 86.97 billion rupees in the quarter, slightly ahead of analysts’ estimate of 86.88 billion rupees, according to Thomson Reuters data. Reliance, India’s second-biggest company by market value and controlled by the country’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, said its standalone revenue from operations rose about 17 percent to 872.27 billion rupees.

2018-04-27,"(Repeats article to additional subscribers, no changes in text) LONDON/FRANKFURT, April 27 (Reuters) - German gas supplier VNG is attracting interest from private equity-backed energy firms including Chrysaor and Point Resources for its Norwegian Norge oil and gas business, which could fetch up to $500 million, three sources said. VNG, which last year hired U.S. investment bank Citi to sell a 51 percent stake in its Norwegian and Danish portfolio, is the latest European utility looking to exit offshore assets on the Norwegian continental shelf, which require heavy investment to develop. One of the sources said Chrysaor, backed by Harbour Energy, an investment vehicle of EIG Global Energy Partners, and Point Resources, which is majority owned by private equity firm HitecVision, would be joined by petrochemicals firm Ineos, which bought oil and gas business from Dong Energy last year, and two more unidentified bidders at the mid-May auction set by VNG. Over the past couple of years, private equity-backed buyers such as Neptune Energy, Chrysaor and Siccar Point Energy have snapped up unwanted assets from major energy producers and big utilities. Chrysaor declined to comment, while a spokeswoman for Point Resources said “our company policy is not to comment speculations in media”. Ineos was not immediately available to comment and VNG Norge did not respond to a request for comment. Two of the sources familiar with the matter also said firms that had initially shown an interest, including DEA, a vehicle of Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman which is in the process of merging with Wintershall, and Sweden’s Lundin Petroleum, were unlikely to pursue their interest. Lundin declined to comment and DEA was not immediately available to comment. VNG’s portfolio includes the $1.3 billion Fenja development, one of the largest recent North Sea oil discoveries estimated to hold about 100 million barrels of oil equivalents, as well as substantial stakes in four other operated licences and minor stakes in three producing fields off Norway. VNG is majority-owned by German utility EnBW with a 74.2 percent stake. Other European utilities that have divested offshore Norwegian assets recently include France’s Engie, which sold its UK and Norwegian North Sea fields, while British utility Centrica combined its North Sea business with Bayerngas Norge, an unlisted arm of German Stadwerke Muenchen and Bayerngas. Sources told Reuters that Endeavour Energy UK had launched the sale of its North Sea oil and gas assets and Spain’s Repsol was also considering selling its energy portfolio in the region. $1 = 0.8214 euros

2018-04-27,"* Average price is 4.66 cents/kWh vs 0.44 cents year ago * Approvals include some bids at zero subsidy * Wraps up capacity allowances granted pre-reforms * Orsted, Innogy report winning approvals By Vera Eckert FRANKFURT, April 27 (Reuters) - Germany granted approval on Friday for offshore wind parks capable of generating 1,610 megawatts (MW) of power at contract prices well above the unexpectedly low bids seen in an auction a year ago. The total amount of electricity that could be produced by the parks equates to the power generated by one large nuclear power station, or two big coal- or gas-fired power plants. Six projects were granted licences for construction at an average 4.66 euro cents per kilowatt hour (kWh), compared with an average 0.44 euro cents in the first auction a year ago, the Bundesnetzagentur network agency said. This auction wraps up two rounds for a total 3,100 MW of projects applied for before Aug. 1, 2016, after which new projects became subject to reforms to the offshore subsidy scheme. While the industry has cut costs sharply in recent years, last year’s results were widely viewed as overly optimistic. Bundesnetzagentur President Jochen Homann said on Friday this year’s result reflected a changed competitive situation, but noted the range of bids made by would-be operators again included some not seeking a subsidy. The range was between zero and 9.83 cents for the six projects, three of which are in the Baltic Sea and three in the North Sea. Germany’s Innogy said it had been awarded the rights to build and operate the 325 MW Kaskasi wind farm in the North Sea. Denmark’s Orsted, formerly Dong, said it won approval for a 551.75 MW bid. The operators rely on expected wholesale power price revenue for the time that the offshore wind capacity starts operating plus the auction price awarded, to achieve profitability. The reforms entailed relying entirely on auctions instead of the fixed subsidies of the past, in the hope this would drive down costs. The winners get an option to build the wind parks at the price they were awarded and gain the right to onshore connections and operation rights for 25 years. German thermal operators currently obtain 3.8 cents a kWh in the wholesale market for power delivery next year while end-users of electricity pay around 30 cents/kWh, due to a high share of taxes and fees. Last year, Orsted and EnBW won a total 1,490 MW of capacity permits, pledging to build 1,380 MW of the total at zero subsidy. Offshore wind costs have fallen sharply around the North Sea as the industry develops, while proximity to existing construction and maintenance hubs and to onshore connections is also beginning to allow more economies of scale. In the industry’s infancy, operators secured sky-high support payments for years, as there was little experience of installing turbines far out at sea, which is necessary due to Germany’s geography.

2018-04-27,"OSLO (Reuters) - Government plans for slowing climate change remain ‘woefully inadequate’ despite promises of tougher action under the 2015 Paris agreement, according to Fiji, which will preside at United Nations talks in Germany next week. Officials from almost 200 nations will work on a “rule book” for the Paris accord at the April 30-May 10 meeting in Bonn. The pact aims to end the fossil fuel era this century but has been weakened by U.S. President Donald Trump’s plans to withdraw. Fiji praised governments for action including a deal this month to cut greenhouse gas emissions from shipping by 2050. And no nations have followed Trump in planning to quit. But overall “the current commitments nationally are woefully inadequate,” Luke Daunivalu, Fiji’s chief negotiator, told Reuters in a telephone interview. Fiji is the current president of the U.N. negotiations. Dozens of nations, including China, Saudi Arabia and European Union states, have submitted documents to the United Nations in recent weeks about the state of global climate action. “One recurrent, cross-cutting theme was that the scale and pace of climate action must increase dramatically, and immediately so” to avoid dangerous man-made climate change, Fiji wrote in a document summing up the proposals. China, for instance, said there are still “huge gaps” in efforts to curb climate change and that rich nations are lagging  in pledges to provide $100 billion a year to developing nations from 2020 to help them tackle warming. Small island developing states, from the Pacific to the Caribbean, say they are suffering ever more from rising sea levels and storm surges whipped up by cyclones. They say there is too much hand-wringing and too little action. “If we spent as much time working on this problem as we do congratulating ourselves for caring so deeply about it, we would be closer to an outcome worthy of a celebration,” said Thoriq Ibrahim, environment minister for the Maldives and chairman of the Alliance of Small Island States. The rule book, formally the “implementation guidelines” for a pact that has no sanctions for non-compliance, will define ways to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions, and how to review and step up national actions every five years. Agreement on the rules, due at a meeting in Poland in December, “will be the most critical moment...since the outcome in Paris in 2015,” said David Waskow, of the World Resources Institute think-tank. Trump, who doubts climate change is mainly caused by human activities, plans to quit but cannot formally withdraw until 2020. French President Emmanuel Macron predicted this week that Washington would sometime rejoin.

2018-04-27,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer, posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday as weakness in its chemical and refining operations offset a boost from higher crude prices CLc1 LCOc1.  It was the second consecutive quarter of weakness in Exxon  units that make gasoline, plastics and related products. Exxon blamed weak margins for the income drop in those segments. Shares of Irving, Texas-based Exxon fell 2.5 percent to $78.86 in premarket trading. The company posted net income of $4.7 billion, or $1.09 per share, compared to $4.01 billion, or 95 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.  By that measure, analysts expected earnings of $1.12 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Profit jumped more than 50 percent in the company’s upstream division, which pumps oil and natural gas, thanks largely to rising commodity prices. In the downstream refining unit, though, profit fell 12 percent, and in the chemical unit, profit dropped 14 percent.         Production fell 6 percent to 3.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). Exxon said earlier this month it resumed production at the Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas (LNG) project a fortnight ahead of schedule after it was shut down in the wake of a deadly earthquake in February.     The shutdown cut quarterly earnings by $80 million and production by about 25,000 boe/d, Exxon said.    The company has struggled in the past 16 months to unwind some of the biggest bets taken by former Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson, who left to become U.S. secretary of state in early 2017 before being fired by President Donald Trump last month.        Exxon has recorded billions of dollars in writedowns amid falling production since Tillerson left, and successor CEO Darren Woods has moved quickly to try to repair operations.     Woods laid out a bold plan last month to double annual earnings by 2025 through heavier investments in U.S. shale, Guyana and several LNG projects around the world.        The company plans to hold a conference call with investors to discuss quarterly results on Friday morning.     Exxon rival Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) on Thursday posted a 42 percent jump in first-quarter profit, its highest earnings in more than three years.

2018-04-27,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A Singapore court blocked commodity trader Noble Group Ltd from holding its annual meeting of shareholders on Monday following legal action sought by dissident shareholder, Goldilocks Investment Co. Ltd. Friday’s ruling is the latest skirmish between Noble and Goldilocks, Noble’s third-largest shareholder, in the fight over Noble’s restructuring plans with creditors, which will be put forward for shareholder approval a few weeks after the planned annual general meeting (AGM). Goldilocks sought to halt the AGM after Noble rejected its nominations for five new director to the Singapore-listed trader’s board. “The judge decided that Noble be restrained from proceeding with the AGM currently fixed for April 30,” Suresh Nair, a Singapore-based counsel representing Goldilocks, told Reuters. Abu Dhabi-based Goldilocks, which holds an 8.1 percent stake in Noble, filed lawsuits in Singapore this week, saying Noble is not recognising its “legitimate legal rights” as a shareholder and asked the Singapore High Court to block Monday’s meeting. This week, Noble rejected Goldilocks’ nominations that were to be proposed at the AGM, saying the paperwork was not valid. Noble declined to comment on Friday’s ruling. Trading in the company’s shares was halted on Friday afternoon pending an announcement from the company. The Singapore High Court confirmed it had granted the injunction against Noble on “modified terms.” Once Asia’s largest commodity trader, Noble market value has plunged to just $88 million (64 billion pounds), from $6 billion in February 2015. The company has sold billions of dollars of assets, taken hefty writedowns and cut hundreds of jobs over the past three years to slash debt. The legal fight stems from Goldilocks’ dispute with Noble over its $3.4 billion debt restructuring plan. Noble has agreed to hand over 70 percent equity stake in its restructured business to senior creditors in return for reducing its debt in half. Existing shareholders will get a 15 percent equity stake in the new company. Goldilocks, which last month sued Noble and its management, alleging they had inflated its assets, opposes the restructuring plan as protecting creditors at the expense of shareholders.  In a letter this month, Goldilocks said the equity stake given to shareholders “will have little or no value” since the cash flows from the new company will be directed to the portion held by creditors. Goldilocks has also started legal action to prevent Noble, the company’s board and supporting creditors from proceeding with the debt deal. Noble says the restructuring plan will benefit all stakeholders, and an insolvency is the only alternative if shareholders do not approve its proposal. Earlier this month, Noble improved the terms of the restructuring and won the support of its biggest shareholder Richard Elman, who also founded the company. Noble was plunged into crisis in February 2015 when Iceberg Research questioned its books. Noble has stood by its accounting.

2018-04-27,"* Gas producers to sign supply contracts by end-April -NDRC * Contracts to include planned cuts to some users - official * Targets set to build new storage by 2020 * Encourage trading of gas storages at national exchanges * (Adds more details on contract management; pricing scheme) By Chen Aizhu BEIJING, April 27 (Reuters) - China’s state-run natural gas producers have been told to sign annual supply contracts with major users by the end of this month, a senior planning official said on Friday, as the country seeks to avoid a repeat of this winter’s severe gas shortages. Freezing weather and a sweeping campaign to switch millions of homes and businesses from coal to natural gas to tackle smog led to a supply crunch earlier this year. Supplies were cut to some industrial users as authorities prioritised households. “We remain under big pressure to ensure sufficient supplies this winter ... we shall have more adequate preparations,” said Zhao Chenxi, head of the bureau of economic operations adjustment at the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). Demand for gas is expected to grow strongly this year as Beijing promotes the cleaner-burning fuel and the economy improves, Zhao told a media briefing. China’s gas demand grew by nearly 10 percent in the first quarter of 2018 to 71.2 billion cubic meters from a year earlier, following a 15 percent jump for the full year of 2017. Zhao said the annual contracts should include details of any supply cuts for major users during the peak winter heating season, which runs from mid-November to mid-March, stipulating the duration of such cuts and the volume to be reduced. During periods of emergency situations, the additional cost of gas supply would be borne by either the buyer whose demand is above the contracted amount or the supplier who provides less than the contracted volumes, the NDRC said in a separate statement released later on Friday. China has already pledged to build more gas pipelines and storage facilities to help ensure adequate gas supplies in the future. NDRC officials said on Friday that gas suppliers — mainly state-owned companies like China National Petroleum Corp, Sinopec Group and China National Offshore Oil Corp — will be required to have storage facilities able to meet at least 10 percent of their contracted sales by 2020. Local authorities will need to have sufficient storage to cover three days of consumption in their administrative regions, and city gas distributors must have storage equal to 5 percent of their annual supplies within the same time frame. For local gas distributors who fail to meet the storage obligations or refuse to sign up supply contracts, they risk losing their business licenses, the NDRC said. Market-based pricing will also be introduced to boost investment in the sector, the NDRC officials said. The government is also encouraging the trading of gas storage capacity on gas exchanges in the cities of Shanghai and Chongqing, the NDRC said in the later statement. In areas where there is wide price discrepancies between high- and low-demand seasons, a special pricing policy will apply to retail users to even out the cost throughout the year, the statement said. China operates 25 gas storage facilities with a total working volume of 11.7 billion cubic metres, equal to less than 5 percent of the country’s gas consumption. This is well below the 20 percent mark for top gas consumers such as the United States and Russia. Industry analysts have said China’s regulated gas pricing and near-monopoly in key distribution infrastructure are hurdles to future growth. Reporting by Aizhu Chen and Tom Daly; Editing by Richard

2018-04-27,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore will extend the mandatory use of mass-flow-meters to bunker barges delivering distillate fuels to large ships, the port authority said on Friday, ahead of an expected pick-up in the use of distillates to meet caps on sulfur content.  Singapore, the world’s largest marine refueling hub, became the first port to mandate the use of mass-flow-meters (MFMs) in 2017, making them compulsory for marine fuel oil bunker barges licensed by the Maritime Port Authority (MPA). Along with a crackdown on short deliveries to bunker fuel customers, the meters have improved transparency for buyers and helped boost Singapore’s status as a refueling port.     “The use of the MFM system will enhance transparency in the bunkering process, improve operational efficiency and increase the productivity of the bunkering industry,” the MPA said in a statement.  “This will also prepare the industry for an expected increase in delivery of distillates with the introduction of a 0.5 percent global sulfur cap from 1 January 2020 by the International Maritime Organization (IMO),” said Captain M. Segar, assistant chief executive at the MPA.  The IMO’s new rules will significantly cut the amount of sulfur that the world’s ships can burn in their engines.  Middle distillate fuels, such as marine gasoil, generally contain less sulfur than fuel oil, which has traditionally been the fuel used in large ocean-going vessels. Now, middle distillates are expected to be used increasingly to meet the new restrictions.  “With the growing demand for low sulfur distillate fuels, Sinanju will be retrofitting more than half of our fleet of 13 bunker tankers,” said Desmond Chong, general manager of Singapore’s Sinanju Tankers Holdings in a statement on Friday.  Sinanju’s bunker tanker, the Marine Pamela, is Singapore’s first distillates bunker tanker installed with two flow meter systems and was involved in the test procedures for distillate MFMs, the company said.  The use of MFMs for distillate deliveries will be made compulsory from July 1, 2019, the MPA said. Singapore set record sales volumes of marine fuels in 2017 for a third straight year.

2018-04-27,"TUNCELI, Turkey, April 27 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - B aris Yildirim, a lawyer and activist, strolled across a manicured park on the edge of the Munzur River that runs through Tunceli, a small city in eastern Turkey. On the other side of a fence is the Uzuncayir hydropower dam that was completed in 2010 and flooded a site sacred to Alevis, the country’s largest religious minority. Yildirim, an Alevi living in the home of his ancestors - who revere nature - has been on a mission since 2008 to stop the government from building more dams in the province. “This park was built to appease us by the company who built that dam,” Yildirim said bitterly. “But now we have to pray through a fence.” Yildirum has filed lawsuits and won some cases over the years. His latest battle is to prevent the government seizing land for the Konaktepe dam, which would be located inside a nearby nature reserve. Winning, he said, could mean saving the Alevi’s cultural heritage. The founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, saw dams as a way forward for the developing nation, and many of those now being built were planned decades ago. Locals who oppose the dams have become victims of the country’s energy politics, said Ozer Meral Uc, an ecologist and member of the Munzur Flows Freely movement, a coalition of 40 civil society groups in Tunceli. Officials have publicly said hydroelectric dams are needed to meet Turkey’s energy and water needs and reduce its dependency on countries that sell energy. “The state wants to reduce its dependence on energy from foreign countries,” Uc said. “But the Konaktepe will flood people’s homes.” Moreoever, water stored in dams could prevent drought for several years if needed, the government has said. Last year, water levels were at their lowest in nearly half a century. Making up about 15-20 percent of Turkey’s 79 million people, Alevis draw from Shi’a, Sufi and Anatolian folk traditions, practicing distinct rituals which can put them at odds with their Sunni Muslim counterparts, many of whom accuse them of heresy. “The government is trying to assimilate us into Sunni Islam. There’s a project to kill our culture and heritage,” said Yildirim. The government, which has held a series of workshops for Alevis to allow them to voice their concerns in an effort to reconcile tense relations, was unavailable for comment despite numerous emails and calls. Four years ago, Yildirim won a lawsuit at the country’s highest court halting construction of the Konaktepe dam. The court ruled the dam was illegal as it would cut through the Munzur National Park, an area rich in biodiversity, where 1,600 types of flora and fauna thrive. Despite the ruling the government has continued to push forward with the project by buying and seizing land, Yildirim said. HYDRO-PUSH The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has ramped up building dams - 111 in 2017 alone, local media said - despite an international outcry from environmentalists and local people. When the government seizes land to build infrastructure deemed in the national interest, it is legally obliged to compensate landowners. When they refuse to sell, cases end up in court. Despite the court ruling four years ago, the Resmi Gazete - which publishes laws and official announcements - said in 2016 the government would expropriate land in the mountains where the Konaktepe dam was going to be built. Once completed, the dam would produce 1.2 percent of the country’s energy, worth $80 million annually, according to a 2009 report from the Istanbul Water Tribunal, an international body that resolves water conflicts. Some people have already sold their land. “Many of the people who sell their land don’t understand the consequences,” Yildirim said. Back in 1985, Celal Kara’s father sold his land when one of the first Tunceli dams - the Mercan - was being built. Kara said he was duped. “My father was convinced, because the government then told us that our village will look like Paris. But the trees were cut down. Nature was destroyed and we lost our village,” she said. The Konaktepe dam was one of a number of projects planned in 1998 in a deal between Turkey and the United States’ Department of Commerce. The plan originally envisioned the involvement of EXIM bank, which underwrites risk for U.S. companies abroad, though the bank told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by email it was involved only in the pre-project phase. Opaqueness around the project means it is unclear which foreign or local companies are involved, or even at what stage the process is at, activists said. Sarah Bardeen, a spokeswoman for International Rivers, a U.S.-based advocacy group, said Tunceli locals were in a difficult position. “Governments need to abide by their judiciary - and Turkey’s judiciary decisively halted the Konaktepe Dam in 2014. But the project is rearing its ugly head again,” Bardeen said. “If the government won’t abide by the rules, locals and their allies will have to target the financiers and the construction companies that are moving forward with an illegal project against the wishes of the local people.” Yildirim and other activists in the Munzur Flows Freely movement said solar power would prove much less damaging to their sacred environment and could meet their energy needs. Protests against dam-building projects fizzled out after the government fined protesters in Tunceli and elsewhere following the attempted coup in 2016 when rogue elements in the military tried to overthrow President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkey has been in a state of emergency since then. In the Ovacik district of Tunceli, snow-capped mountains loom over an Alevi holy site, where young men and women in jeans and sweaters light candles and place them in the crevices of soot-filled steps on the edge of the Munzur River. Nearby, Yurdanur Toprak, a mother of two college-aged daughters, cooks gozleme - a vegetable-filled dough. Her cheeks red from the heat, Toprak said they did not need dams.

2018-04-27,"* European tech stocks up 0.75 pct following Asian peers higher * Dollar hits highest level since Jan 12 on higher UST yields * Sterling hits lowest since March 9 as Britain's economy slows Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Abhinav Ramnarayan LONDON, April 27 (Reuters) - World stocks rose on Friday, lifted by strong share price gains for tech giants such as Amazon and Facebook and growing hopes of a lasting peace on the Korean peninsula after a ground-breaking meeting of North and South Korean leaders. European shares were set to end the week with a flourish too with a pan-European index set to post its fifth week of gains in a row, rivaling last September’s winning streak, with the tech sector strongly outperforming. The latest gains are being partly spurred by forecast-beating first quarter earnings from two of the so-called FANG tech stocks — some of the world’s largest and most influential companies by market capitalisation — which has boosted sentiment on the technology sector worldwide. Amazon.com Inc shares jumped more than 6 percent in after-market trading while Facebook surged 9.1 percent on Thursday, calming worries about the fallout from its use of consumer data. “Macro-economic data has been soft in a number of key economies, so it is reassuring that amidst those concerns we are still seeing strong earnings numbers coming through from big ticket corporates such as Amazon and Facebook,” said Investec economist Victoria Clarke. “This is a good gauge of the broad drivers of sentiment particularly when there are those concerns about demand holding up in the face of weak economic data,” Clarke added. European tech shares rose 0.75 percent to the highest in more than five weeks, buoyed also by gains in local IT and chipmaking firms such as Capgemini, ASML and Infineon. In Britain, there was bad news on the growth front, with data showing the economy slowed much more sharply than expected in the first three months of 2018. That has slashed market expectations of an interest rate increase by the Bank of England next month and sent sterling plunging to the lowest since March 9 against the dollar The data indicated “that the (UK) slowdown is more structural”, Mizuho’s head of hedge fund sales, Neil Jones, said. However, sterling’s slide helped UK shares on the FTSE index to rise nearly half a percent with gains led by multi-national earners which earn a big chunk of their revenues overseas but report profits in pounds. The weak data adds to concerns that economic growth across the developed world is running out of steam, especially after lacklustre euro zone figures earlier in the week and data on Friday showing French economic growth slowed more than expected in the first quarter. “The euro zone’s economy doesn’t seem to have the type of momentum it had last year,” said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore. Earlier, though, Asian markets revelled in the glow of the summit between North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and South Korean president Moon Jae-in. Political leaders and investors hope this would ease tensions over Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons programme and pave the way for the North and South to end their decades-long conflict. That helped Seoul shares briefly rise more than 1 percent to a one-month high and the won firmed. MSCI’s index of Asian shares outside Japan rallied 0.8 percent and Japan’s Nikkei share average rose 0.7 percent to two-month peaks. The dollar meanwhile hit its highest since Jan. 12 against a basket of currencies, having benefited from the recent run in U.S. Treasury yields — 10-year yields hit 3 percent this week for the first time since January 2014. With a weekly gain of more than 1.5 percent, the greenback is set for its best weekly performance since late-November 2016. “U.S. rates didn’t matter for the dollar, now they do and our positioning metrics suggest there is further scope for short dollar positions to be unwound,” said Michael Sneyd, global head of FX strategy at BNP Paribas in London.

2018-04-27,"LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian thermal coal demand is defying its typical seasonal slowdown as well as the expanding use of renewables and natural gas, with prices holding not far off $100 a tonne despite the onset of the usual lull at this time of year. Benchmark Australian thermal coal prices GCLNWCPFBMc1 are at $93.40 a tonne, their highest seasonal level in five years and $15 per tonne above the five-year average price. Coal’s strength is also visible in the derivatives market, where API2 2018 coal futures TRAPI2Yc1 are at around $83 a tonne, around 25 percent higher than in April 2017. The firm prices are due to robust use in India, Japan, South Korea and even China, where coal consumption has held up despite huge programmes to boost the use of gas and renewable energy. “Coal demand for the coming two years is expected to remain stable around current levels. Although headlines in the newspapers may suggest that coal demand will peak soon, in reality, demand will remain solid in the coming years,” said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro. GRAPHIC: Seasonal Newcastle coal prices: reut.rs/2Jtp1Po Thermal coal remains the most-used fuel for power generation globally, especially in Asia which uses more than 70 percent of the world’s thermal coal, up from under 50 percent in 2000, according to BP’s latest Statistical Review of the World. The strong demand comes despite coal’s image as a dirty fuel which has left it increasingly shunned by many investors. However, cashing in on strong demand have been specialist thermal coal miners like Australia’s Whitehaven Coal (WHC.AX), Indonesia’s Adaro Energy (ADRO.JK) and Glencore (GLEN.L), who have been outperforming their peers from the natural gas market like Santos (STO.AX) or Woodside (WPL.AX). “Thermal coal is probably one of the most hated asset classes globally but if you look at demand, it’s roughly flat while under-investment is leading to lower supply,” said Per Lekander, portfolio manager at investment management firm Landsdowne Partners, which owns shares of U.S. coal miner Peabody (BTU.N) and global commodity trader and miner Glencore.  For the rest of the year, analysts expect prices to remain strong, with a slowdown in demand only starting to weigh on prices from the 2020s as renewables and natural gas gradually eat into coal’s use.      Yet-to-be-finalised negotiations between Australian miners and Japanese utilities, who set annual supply prices which act as a guidance for the rest of Asia, show price levels in the mid-$90 per tonne for 2018, according to several sources with knowledge of the matter. A Thomson Reuters poll of analysts in March shows an average forecast for spot Australian Newcastle physical coal at around $87 a tonne this year, $80 in 2019 and $73 in 2020. GRAPHIC: Coal use by region 2000 to 2016: reut.rs/2Ep3x4K One of the surprises over the past year has been China, where many analysts expected a decline in coal demand due to its drive to use more renewables and move millions of households to use natural gas for heating. Although China’s plans to switch to cleaner fuels has led to a gradual decline away from record coal consumption between 2012 and 2014, demand for coal is still firm, as many power stations and industrial facilities still rely on the commodity. Restocking by utilities after the lunar new year prompted a 20 percent jump in coal imports in March from a year earlier, customs data showed. However, several ports in China have introduced restrictions on coal imports as the government tries to support domestic coal prices and encourage more local production. It is unclear how long the restrictions will last and whether they will reduce demand, but they are unlikely to affect Australian or Russian exports of coal, which are high-quality grades. “Coal production in China dropped sharply in January-February due to the New Year holiday, but we expect output ... to rise this year as lower imports boost demand for domestic coal,” said consultancy Capital Economics. “Of course, government policy can significantly alter the dynamics of the market. Further interventions by the Chinese government on either the supply or demand side are a risk to our forecasts.” Elsewhere in Asia, imports by Japan and South Korea also remain strong. More than 40 percent of South Korea’s nuclear generation is currently offline, which has driven the need for increased coal use. Coal’s rally since 2016 has revived companies like Peabody from bankruptcy. Tempted by high prices, many miners are now eyeing higher output. For the first time in years, over the past two quarters, 80 to 90 percent of global miners have been making money due to higher coal prices, said Georgi Slavov, head of research at commodities brokerage Marex Spectron. He warned, however, that rising production could weigh on prices and profits again towards the end of the year and into 2019.

2018-04-27,"* Head of gas regulator says GAIL to be split by March 2019 * Pipelines to be made available to smaller end-users * Proposals to allow end-users to buy, store fuel at LNG terminals By Promit Mukherjee and Nidhi Verma MUMBAI/NEW DELHI, April 27 (Reuters) - India plans to split state-run gas utility GAIL by March next year to create two companies: one marketing gas, and another operating pipelines that can be used by consumers who buy direct from producers, the head of the sector’s regulator told Reuters. GAIL (India) Ltd is the country’s biggest gas marketing and trading firm and owns most of the nation’s pipelines, giving it a stranglehold on the market for the fuel. By splitting GAIL, the regulator of India’s oil and gas sector hopes to increase the number of gas consumers and attract the billions of dollars needed to expand the pipeline network and build more liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals. “All this un-bundling should be done within this fiscal year (to March 31, 2019),” D.K. Sarraf, chairman of India’s Petroleum and Natural Gas Board, told Reuters. GAIL already keeps separate accounts for its gas pipeline and marketing businesses, making it easier to split them into two entities before a change of ownership, he said. Sarraf did not say which business GAIL would retain. India’s Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan in January said the company should focus on laying pipelines, suggesting it is the marketing side that would be hived off. By unbundling GAIL and opening the sector, the government hopes to increase gas use and meet its objective of raising the share of a cleaner, cheaper fuel as a part of the energy mix to 15 percent, from 6.2 percent, in the next 12 years. Many power plants and small industries like ceramic, glass and cement makers rely heavily on more expensive or dirtier fuels such as naphtha, diesel and coal. In future, though, even small companies will be able to buy gas via pipelines, without having to go through GAIL. Only a handful of companies - including Petronet LNG Ltd , Indian Oil Corp Ltd and Gujarat State Petroleum Corp -  currently import and sell gas in India. The gas regulator hopes by July, however, to draft norms for allowing end-users to bid for using LNG terminals to import gas. “We are planning to put LNG terminals on public access to the extent of 20 percent,” Sarraf said. The regulator was also looking at how to open access to the pipeline network for smaller buyers. India’s gas demand is constrained by low domestic output, a small number of LNG terminals - just four - and a pipeline network that does not reach enough customers. GAIL owns more than two-thirds of India’s existing 15,000 km (940 miles) of pipelines, but the government wants to more than double the network to expand gas deliveries. While the new pipeline company created by the division of GAIL would be expected to lead the way, the government also wants other companies to bid for rights to build and operate pipelines. Three LNG import facilities are also under construction, and there are proposals for many more. Domestic gas production is also expected to rise. Sarraf estimated an investment of nearly $20 billion would be needed over the next several years for laying pipelines. Only the western state of Gujarat has an extensive city gas distribution network, though some other major cities, including New Delhi and Mumbai have been hooked up to gas.

2018-04-27,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will invest in trash-burning incinerators and aim for all packaging to be 100 percent recycled by 2025 after China, which took one third of the country’s rubbish, banned waste imports, its environment minister said on Friday. The Chinese ban from March 1 affects 1.25 million tonnes of Australian waste, worth an estimated A$850 million ($640 million), according to government-commissioned research by consultancy Blue Environment. Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg said he had directed government funding bodies to “prioritise” waste-to-energy  projects, which include incinerators and landfill gas harvesting. “Obviously we’d like to see waste reused or recycled, primarily, but waste-to-energy is a legitimate source of generation,” Frydenberg told reporters in Melbourne. Recycling is a A$5 billion industry in Australia, according to research firm IBISWorld. In Australia about 30 waste-to-energy projects are operational, mostly confined to small incinerators and co-generation plants, though a handful of larger projects are on the drawing board. A public backlash due to pollution fears saw a major project in Sydney stall in 2018. China, the world’s biggest importer of plastic waste, has stopped accepting shipments of rubbish, such as plastic and paper, as part of a campaign against “foreign garbage”. The ban has upended the world’s waste handling supply chain and caused massive pile-ups of trash from Asia to Europe, as exporters struggled to find new buyers for the garbage.  Governments in Britain and the European Union have focused on boosting recycling rates in response to the Chinese ban, the British introducing a deposit return scheme for plastic bottles and the EU mulling a plastic tax. Other countries have found new destinations for export, with New Zealand’s waste shipments to Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand surging as exports to China plunged, according to Statistics New Zealand. “Some stock is moving, the material that’s clean has been exported, but at much lower prices than it was when China was buying,” said Max Spedding, convener of Australia’s National Waste and Recycling Industry Council. The rest is being stockpiled, he said. Technology to generate electricity from waste has existed since the 1970s and is widely used in Japan, Germany, Scandinavian countries and the United States -  where it also generates worry about stench and the risk of toxic emissions. Typically, such plants produce modest amounts of electricity but divert considerable waste from landfill.  “When a product can be recycled, recycling is going to be better than any form of energy recovery, particularly incineration,” said Jenni Downes, a researcher at the University of Technology Sydney’s Institute for Sustainable Futures division.

2018-04-27,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian oil major Eni (ENI.MI) on Friday reported a 31 percent rise in first-quarter profits, boosted by higher oil prices and output and confirmed its production growth targets for the current year.  Eni said adjusted net profit in the quarter was 0.978 billion euros ($1.18 billion), in line with an analyst consensus provided by the company of 0.98 billion euros. Royal Dutch Shell RDAs.L, Total (TOTF.PA) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) all reported strong growth in profits on Thursday on the back of higher output and soaring oil prices. Brent crude oil prices in the first quarter have risen above last year’s $54.5 to average around $67 a barrel as OPEC  continues to keep a cap on supplies amid growing demand. State-controlled Eni said production in the first three months rose 4 percent to 1.87 million barrels of oil equivalent. It confirmed its business plan target of production growth for the full year of 4 percent, lifted in part by ramp-ups at  major fields in Egypt, Kazakhstan and Indonesia. Thanks to bumper gas discoveries in Mozambique and the Zohr field in Egypt, Eni has one of the strongest discovery records in the industry. “In the first quarter of 2018, Eni achieved excellent  economic and financial results, over and above the rising price of oil,” Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi said. He confirmed the company’s cash neutrality - funding of capex and dividend - at a Brent price of $55 in 2018.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.8 percent, but still looked set to shed 0.9 percent for the week. European stocks are expected to open higher, according to financial spreadbetters, with Britain’s FTSE 100 seen opening 5 points up, Germany’s DAX is expected to gain 57 points while France’s CAC is seen rising 13 points. South Korea’s KOSPI briefly rose more than 1 percent to a one-month high, helped by hopes that the summit could ease tensions over Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons programme and pave the way for the North and South to end their decades-long conflict. South Korean equities later pared their gains to 0.8 percent , while the South Korean won rose more than 0.5 percent against the dollar in onshore trade. “The easing of tension and the possibility of a peace treaty coming on the horizon are bullish for the won and KOSPI,” said Mingze Wu, FX trader of global payments for INTL FCStone Ltd in Singapore. “However,...it will be difficult to imagine a new bullish trend emerging just from this,” Wu said. Japan’s Nikkei share average rose 0.7 percent and touched a two-month peak at one point, getting a boost as chip-related firms rallied after brisk earnings forecasts from Advantest and Kyocera. The firmer tone of Asian equities came after each of Wall Street’s major indexes rose 1 percent or more on Thursday, boosted by solid earnings results and a rebound in technology stocks. Amazon.com Inc shares jumped more than 6 percent in after-market trading after the online retailer reported a 43 percent surge in first-quarter revenue. Facebook surged 9.1 percent on Thursday after posting an impressive earnings beat, which appeared to calm worries about the fallout from its use of consumer data. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield fell more than 1 basis point in Asia to about 2.975 percent, down from a four-year high of 3.035 percent set earlier in the week. The U.S. 10-year yield had edged lower on Thursday as buyers emerged in the wake of a sell-off fuelled by worries over growing U.S. debt issuance and rising costs. The euro languished near a 3-1/2-month low, having taken a hit after the European Central Bank on Thursday struck a dovish tone as it kept interest rates unchanged. ECB chief Mario Draghi acknowledged evidence of a “pull-back” from exceptional growth readings seen around the turn of the year, although the central bank sought to bolster expectations for a gradual withdrawal of its monetary stimulus. The euro held steady at $1.2107. On Thursday it hit a trough of $1.20965, its lowest level since Jan. 12. Weaker-than-expected economic data out of the euro zone has cast some doubt as to how quickly the ECB can head toward policy normalisation and weighed on the euro recently. “The euro zone’s economy doesn’t seem to have the type of momentum it had last year,” said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore. The dollar, which has drawn strength from the recent rise in U.S. bond yields, held steady against a basket of six major currencies at 91.555. The dollar index had set a 3-1/2-month high of around 91.637 on Thursday. The yen showed little reaction after the Bank of Japan kept its monetary policy steady as widely expected. Against the yen, the dollar held steady at 109.28 yen , having backed off slightly from a 2-1/2-month peak of 109.49 yen struck on Thursday. Oil prices edged lower on Friday but Brent largely held gains from the previous session amid concerns that Iran may face renewed sanctions, choking off supply. Global benchmark Brent crude futures fell 0.4 percent to $74.47 a barrel, after rising 1 percent on Thursday.

2018-04-27,"SINGAPORE, April 27 (Reuters) - Singapore will extend the mandatory use of mass-flow-meters to bunker barges delivering distillate fuels to large ships, the port authority said on Friday, ahead of an expected pick-up in the use of distillates to meet caps on sulphur content. Singapore, the world’s largest marine refuelling hub, became the first port to mandate the use of mass-flow-meters (MFMs) in 2017, making them compulsory for marine fuel oil bunker barges licensed by the Marine Port Authority (MPA). Along with a crackdown on short deliveries to bunker fuel customers, the meters have improved transparency for buyers and helped boost Singapore’s status as a refuelling port. “The use of the MFM system will enhance transparency in the bunkering process, improve operational efficiency and increase the productivity of the bunkering industry,” the MPA said in a statement. “This will also prepare the industry for an expected increase in delivery of distillates with the introduction of a 0.5 percent global sulphur cap from 1 January 2020 by the International Maritime Organization (IMO),” said captain M. Segar, assistant chief executive at the MPA. The IMO’s new rules will significantly cut the amount of sulphur that the world’s ships can burn in their engines. Middle distillate fuels, such as marine gasoil, generally contain less sulphur than fuel oil, which has been the main fuel used in large ocean-going vessels, and are expected to be used increasingly to meet the new restrictions. The use of MFMs for distillate deliveries will be made compulsory from July 1, 2019, the MPA said. Singapore set record sales volumes of marine fuels in 2017 for a third straight year.

2018-04-27,"SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asia’s most externally vulnerable economies - India, Indonesia and the Philippines - have just taken a one-two punch. U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields US10YT=RR hit 3 percent this week, a level long touted as one to watch for potential portfolio outflows from the region, where interest rates have barely shifted since the U.S. Federal Reserve began slowing hiking policy rates in late 2015. An even bigger worry is that oil prices hit 3-1/2 year highs: not only do these countries run the biggest current account deficits of Asia’s major economies, but they are also among region’s most voracious oil importers. If oil prices stay at their current levels of around $75 a barrel LCOc1, projections for inflation, growth, budget and trade deficits could be missed, increasing selling pressure on the trio’s currencies, stocks and bonds - already among Asia’s worst performers - and potentially forcing their central banks to raise interest rates sooner than they otherwise would. Higher rates could, in turn, hurt growth and budgets, creating a self-feeding loop that further erodes confidence in local assets. “If higher oil prices are sustained, interest rates will be raised faster than anticipated,” said Tilak Doshi, Singapore-based analyst at energy consultancy Muse, Stancil & Co. In its projections for growth and inflation, Indonesia’s central bank said it works on an assumption of oil at $60 a barrel. The Philippines’ said it works with $55-$70, while India, according to two finance ministry sources, works with $65. These averages might still be attained if oil prices drop back, but the recent run-up has prompted many analysts to call an end to the oil market slump that started in 2014 and prompted hints that policymakers’ assumptions are changing. [O/R] In February, the Philippines central bank raised its 2018 inflation projection to 4.3 percent, from 3.4 percent previously, mainly due to higher oil prices, but expects this to be a temporary breach of its 2-4 percent target. At the start of the year, it was expected to raise interest rates once or twice in 2018. Now some analysts see three hikes. India and Indonesia were the last major central banks in Asia to cut rates last year and were mostly expected to stay put throughout 2018, but analysts say hikes are now on the table. Indonesia said on Tuesday it had been selling foreign currency in “quite a sizeable amount” to halt the rupiah’s depreciation since last week. At an IMF meeting in Washington on Sunday, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Urjit Patel flagged oil prices as a growing risk for inflation. “Philippines – three interest rate hikes are expected in the next three meetings. If oil prices stay at these levels, then RBI may have to raise rates ... Indonesia is the next country to watch,” said Robert Subbaraman, chief economist for Asia ex-Japan at Nomura. The Philippines’ current account deficit doubled to 0.8 percent of GDP last year. Indonesia’s current account deficit is seen doubling in the first quarter to 2 percent of GDP, the same level that India’s was in October-December 2017. And things are getting worse. Indonesia’s crude oil imports bill rose by $1 billion, or 54.5 percent on the year, in January-March 2018. The Philippines significantly scaled back oil imports in the first quarter, but still spent $130 million more than the year-ago total. India’s oil imports cost rose by $5 billion, or 26 percent in the same period. Trade balances for India, Philippines & Indonesia deteriorate amid rising import costs: reut.rs/2KgiY1N Local assets are feeling the pressure.  The Philippine peso PHP=, Indonesian rupiah IDR= and Indian rupee INR= have lost around 5 percent from their early January highs. Indian stocks .NSEI fell around 6 percent, Indonesia's .JKSE 11 percent and Philippines' 17 percent. Ten-year bond yields are up 40 basis points (bps) in India IN10YT=RR, and more than 100 bps in Indonesia ID10YT=RR and the Philippines PH10YT=RR over the same period. By contrast in South Korea, also a major oil importer, but one that runs a trade surplus, the won KRW= is steady, stocks .KS11 are up and bond yields KR10YT=RR are marginally higher. Analysts see the selling pressure intensifying. This week, Maybank revised its end-2018 rupee forecast to 66 per dollar, around current levels, from 63.50 previously and ANZ revised it to 67 from 66. “We think the surge in oil price is a key game changer for the rupee as the rise in oil prices present a double whammy on India: one, in terms of current account deterioration and two, in terms of upside risks to inflation,” Maybank analysts said. To be sure, all three countries are considered to have adequate foreign exchange reserves and the current account positions of India and Indonesia are better than during the previous lengthy period of outflows from Asia in 2013-2014, prompted by the Fed’s first signals that its unconventional easing measures were about to be rolled back. Current account and FX reserves in India, Indonesia, Philippines: reut.rs/2JralA5 Higher oil prices could make those economies more vulnerable, but are unlikely to cause panic. Nomura estimates each $10 per barrel increase in oil prices could widen the trade deficit in the Philippines by 0.5 percent of GDP and raise inflation by 20 bps. In Indonesia, it could lower the trade balance by 0.2 percent of GDP and add 10 bps to inflation. In India, it could worsen the current account balance by 0.4 percent of GDP and increase inflation by 30-40 bps. In a note in February, ANZ said an average oil price of $80 a barrel could add 40-50 bps to inflation in each country. Fuel prices are especially politically sensitive in Asia’s poorer countries, and a further risk is that higher costs could push governments to raise subsidies or introduce tighter regulation on prices, which could contain inflation but hurt central budgets and energy firms. Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are facing elections in the coming year, having enjoyed oil prices at historically low levels throughout their terms. In Indonesia, state oil firm Pertamina is shouldering the burden of subsidies as the government has pledged to keep prices unchanged for two years. India has not taken any such measures. “I would classify (subsidies) as a policy mistake, because it means reallocating fiscal resources in an inefficient way,” said Alexander Wolf, senior emerging markets economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “That could erode confidence.” Reporting by Marius Zaharia in HONG KONG and Florence Tan in SINGAPORE; Additional reporting by Gavin Maguire in SINGAPORE, Karen Lema in MANILA, Gayatri Suroyo in JAKARTA and Manoj Kumar in NEW DELHI; Writing by Marius Zaharia; Editing by Alex Richardson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/asia-economy-oil/analysis-higher-oil-prices-could-be-a-game-changer-for-asias-trade-gap-trio-idUKL8N1S22G7,27 Apr 2018,"* Philippines, India, Indonesia back in focus as oil prices

2018-04-27,"BEIJING (Reuters) - At least three steel mills in the Chinese city of Xuzhou, in the nation’s No. 2 steelmaking province, have suspended operations amid local authority orders to shut plants until they meet tough anti-pollution rules, three industry sources said. Those three plants have combined a capacity to produce 4.25 million tonnes of steel a year, a third of the capacity in the city in the eastern province of Jiangsu. The status of other mills in Xuzhou remains unclear. China, the world’s top steel producer, has ordered a host of cities to crack down on heavy industry as part of its years-long war on smog, which has become a hot-button social issue amid concerns about damage to people’s health.  A sales manager at Liguo Zhenbei Steel Co, which operates one of the closed mills, said local authorities had ordered all steel plants in the city to shut until they meet the latest tough requirements aimed at cleaning its notoriously toxic air. “Mills, no matter big or small, have all stopped operations,” he said, declining to give his name as he is not authorized to talk to media. The city’s environmental bureau declined to comment. Xuzhou Dongnan Steel Industrial Co Ltd, one of the city’s biggest steel mills by production capacity, is temporarily closed for maintenance, an official told Reuters by phone. The official did not say how long the plant would be shut. Earlier this month, the city launched six months of environmental inspections at industrial plants and construction sites as part of its 2018 action plan to clean its skies. “At the beginning, I thought my mill would be exempt from the closure list, since our mill emits less harmful substances,” said a deputy general manager at an electric-arc furnace (EAF) in the city. He said his family name was Wang, but declined to give his first name. He did not want the company he works for to be identified. EAFs, or mini-mills, use scrap steel and emit far less carbon than blast furnaces, which have to go through the polluting sintering process to make hot metal. However, Wang’s mill last week was also ordered to close until it can pass a test conducted by a third-party environmental detection agency. That is unlikely to happen before the end of May, he said. Xuzhou is a hub of 13 million tonnes of steelmaking capacity in the eastern province of Jiangsu, China’s second-biggest steel producing province after Hebei. The city is under particular pressure to deal with the problem because its average concentration of hazardous, breathable particles known as PM2.5 rose by 10 percent in 2017, missing the national target for a 20-percent cut. Average PM2.5 levels for April so far have been 110 micrograms per cubic meter, up from the same time last year and almost double the city’s 2018 aim to drop to below 60 micrograms, according to data from China’s National Environmental Monitoring Centre.

2018-04-27,"PARIS (Reuters) - French eyewear company Essilor ESSI.PA, which is in the process of merging with Italian peer Luxottica (LUX.MI), reported a dip in first-quarter sales on Friday as currency swings impacted its business. Sales fell by 5.8 percent to 1.825 billion euros (1.58 billion pounds) from a year ago, hurt by the weakness of the dollar, Brazilian real and Chinese yuan currencies against the euro. A rising euro can make products more expensive for overseas buyers, and also impact revenues earned in dollars when they are translated back into euros. “After this sound start to the year, notably thanks to good performances in sunwear and e-commerce, we are confident that we will meet our full-year targets as the rollout of new products gathers pace over the next few months,” said Essilor Chairman and Chief Executive Hubert Sagnières.  In March, European and U.S. competition regulators approved the 48 billion euros merger of Luxottica and Essilor. The proposed tie-up between Luxottica, whose brands include Ray-Ban, and Essilor - which sells lenses under the Varilux brand - is aimed at taking advantage of an expected strong demand for prescription spectacles and sunglasses as populations age globally.

2018-04-27,"(Reuters) - U.S. carrier Southwest Airlines (LUV.N) has ordered 40 Boeing Co (BA.N) 737 MAX jets worth $4.68 billion at list price to help modernize its fleet, the airline said, making it the planemaker’s largest global customer for the updated narrowbody. Southwest converted options it held over the MAX 8 jets into firm orders, with 10 to be delivered each year from 2019 to 2022, the airline said in a statement on Thursday that announced its first-quarter earnings. “This is first and foremost an extension of our fleet modernization strategy,” Southwest Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly told analysts on a post-earnings conference call, according to a transcript.  “We have a very strong business case to replace older 737-700 aircraft given the superior operating economics of the MAX 8.” Southwest is the world’s largest operator of 737 jets, with more than 700 of the airplanes. The airline has now ordered nearly 300 Boeing MAX jets, the most of any customer, a Boeing spokesman said. The MAX series is more fuel efficient than previous models. Southwest warned on Thursday that the consequences of a mid-air engine explosion on a 737-700 last week will weigh on second-quarter bookings, as investigators probe the events that led to the first passenger death in the airline’s history.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.4 percent, but still looked set to shed 1.2 percent for the week. South Korea’s KOSPI briefly rose more than 1 percent to a one-month high, helped by hopes that the summit could ease tensions over Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons programme and pave the way for the North and South to end their decades-long conflict. South Korean equities later pared their gains to 0.6 percent , while the South Korean won rose 0.4 percent against the dollar in onshore trade. “The easing of tension and the possibility of a peace treaty coming on the horizon are bullish for the won and KOSPI,” said Mingze Wu, FX trader of global payments for INTL FCStone Ltd in Singapore. “However, ... it will be difficult to imagine a new bullish trend emerging just from this,” Wu said. Japan’s Nikkei share average rose 0.6 percent and touched a two-month peak at one point, getting a boost as chip-related firms rallied after brisk earnings forecasts from Advantest and Kyocera. The firmer tone of Asian equities came after each of Wall Street’s major indexes rose 1 percent or more on Thursday, boosted by solid earnings results and a rebound in technology stocks. Amazon.com Inc shares jumped more than 6 percent in after-market trading after the online retailer reported a 43 percent surge in first-quarter revenue. Facebook surged 9.1 percent on Thursday after posting an impressive earnings beat, which appeared to calm worries about the fallout from its use of consumer data. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield fell 2 basis points in Asia to 2.973 percent, down from a four-year high of 3.035 percent set earlier in the week. The U.S. 10-year yield had edged lower on Thursday as buyers emerged in the wake of a sell-off fuelled by worries over growing U.S. debt issuance and rising costs. The euro languished near a 3-1/2-month low, having taken a hit after the European Central Bank on Thursday struck a dovish tone as it kept interest rates unchanged. ECB chief Mario Draghi acknowledged evidence of a “pull-back” from exceptional growth readings seen around the turn of the year, although the central bank sought to bolster expectations for a gradual withdrawal of its monetary stimulus. The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.2110. On Thursday it hit a trough of $1.20965, its lowest level since Jan. 12. Weaker-than-expected economic data out of the euro zone has cast some doubt as to how quickly the ECB can head toward policy normalisation and weighed on the euro recently. “The euro zone’s economy doesn’t seem to have the type of momentum it had last year,” said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore. The dollar, which has drawn strength from the recent rise in U.S. bond yields, held steady against a basket of six major currencies at 91.527. The dollar index had set a 3-1/2 month high of around 91.637 on Thursday. The yen showed little reaction after the Bank of Japan kept its monetary policy steady. as widely expected. Against the yen, the dollar eased 0.1 percent to 109.21 yen , inching away from a 2-1/2 month peak of 109.49 yen struck on Thursday.

2018-04-27,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela on Thursday scorned a $2.04 billion award to ConocoPhillips (COP.N) over a decade-old nationalization as the U.S. oil producer filed suit in a federal court to enforce the decision. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s government called the award a “tough lesson” given it was less than 10 percent of what Conoco originally sought. It also said it may appeal Wednesday’s ruling by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) against Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA.  Conoco filed suit on Thursday in the U.S. District court in Manhattan seeking to enforce the award, saying the court had jurisdiction because the ICC arbitration was held in New York and PDVSA had not responded to a demand for payment.   Conoco’s assets in Venezuela were expropriated in 2007 following nationalization of the country’s oil industry led by then-President Hugo Chavez. The firm left the OPEC nation after it could not reach a deal to convert its projects into joint ventures controlled by PDVSA [PDVSA.UL]. The ICC has no means of enforcing its decisions. “We intend to be aggressive and persistent” in recovering the award, Conoco Chief Financial Officer Don Wallette told investors on a Thursday conference call. “It’s something that’s going to take time to recover, the value that we lost.”  Conoco had sought up to $22 billion from PDVSA for broken contracts and loss of future profits from the Hamaca and Petrozuata oil projects. The agreements with PDVSA contained price formulas that limited the compensation Conoco could claim. A separate arbitration case by Conoco against Venezuela before the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) introduced in 2007 could result in a final decision later this year, a lawyer close to the case said. Conoco’s Wallette said the company hopes the ICSID award, which is not subject to price formula limitations, “will represent a full compensation for our value lost.” The case is Phillips Petroleum Co v Petroleos de Venezuela, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-cv-3716 Reporting by Girish Gupta in Caracas; additional reporting by Marianna Parraga and Ernest Scheyder in Houston; Writing by Andrew Cawthorne, Editing by David Gregorio and Richard Pullin",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-conocophillips/update-3-conoco-sues-to-enforce-2-bln-award-that-venezuela-scorns-idUKL1N1S31DM,27 Apr 2018,"Venezuela on Thursday scorned

2018-04-27,"(Reuters) - Carmakers have big plans for their next generation of factories: smarter designs, artificial intelligence and collaborative robots building a wide range of vehicles on the same line. The plants will also feature a component they say is the secret ingredient to flexible manufacturing: humans. SAIC-GM’s factory in Shanghai, which opened in 2016, is one of the world’s most advanced auto plants, assembling Buick minivans and Cadillac sedans and SUVs, including the CT-6 plug-in hybrid for U.S. consumers.  GM’s Shanghai plant is expected to eventually produce new electric vehicles, primarily for the Chinese market, executives have said. The plant, which GM operates with Chinese partner SAIC Motor Corp Ltd, feels almost like a scene from a Star Wars film, with battalions of machines quietly working in self-directed harmony. Collaborative robots, or “cobots,” painted matte green and unrestrained by the steel cages that surround their larger industrial cousins, are being programmed to work alongside humans on the line. One unusual operation advanced models now handle is installing gears in transmissions.  “They can actually feel; they can pick up a gear set (and) mesh the gear into a transmission,” Paul Buetow, GM’s China manufacturing chief, said on a recent tour of the plant. The robots reduce strain on humans and improve quality and consistency. Globally, automakers are embracing Industry 4.0 — a term coined by German manufacturers for the digitalization and automation of assembly processes — and the consensus is that fewer people will be required in future factories. But humans will still be needed. “This is not about cutting head count,” said an insider familiar with industry efforts to upgrade and streamline auto plants in the United States, China and Europe. The focus instead is on improving flexibility and efficiency between machines and humans as automakers figure out how to build multiple models — powered by gas engines, electric motors, or both — in the same factory. “It’s not just blood and sweat that goes into manufacturing on an assembly line,” said United Auto Workers president Dennis Williams. “It’s critical thinking that automation can’t replicate.” A new generation of cobots is working alongside humans at General Motors Co plants from Shanghai to Orion Township, Michigan. The Orion plant, north of Detroit, is one of the industry’s most flexible. It builds three models on one line: The gas-engine Chevrolet Sonic, the battery-powered Chevrolet Bolt EV and the self-driving Cruise AV. More than 800 robots work there, including a half-dozen cobots painted green to denote they can safely operate around humans. The machines handle the “dirty, dull, difficult and dangerous” tasks while people do the work requiring dexterity and intelligence, says Marty Linn, GM’s principal engineer for robotics. In one section of the plant, cobots glue protective pads onto headliners, a tough job for humans because the glue is heated to scalding temperatures before it is applied. At another station, a cobot takes new spare tires off a conveyor belt and stacks them on a cart. This, GM’s Linn said, was a job workers universally hated because it was repetitive and back-breaking. At the end of the line, cobots ensure headlamps are properly aligned. They will also be used to test sensors on automated vehicles, Linn said. Markus Schaefer, head of production and supply chain at Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz Cars, said the German automaker is “paring back automation” in final assembly to boost flexibility. “We need this because we are making a greater variety of derivatives and, as a premium automaker, we make highly individualized vehicles,” he said.  Schaefer said Mercedes will eventually have plants that can build vehicles with different powertrains and with both front- and rear-wheel drive.  The automaker is converting its showcase Sindelfingen plant to build the GLA, a compact front-wheel-drive utility vehicle, as well as its rear-wheel-drive S-Class luxury sedan. How collaborative robots and other digital tools are used will determine the size and layout of future factories - and how many humans work there. Ford Motor Co executive Joe Hinrichs created a stir last October when detailing the automaker’s vision of a future factory for electric vehicles, which have fewer parts than those with combustion engines and thus would require far less floor space, fewer workers and lower investment. But like other major global carmakers, Ford appears reluctant to invest in dedicated electric-vehicle plants until there is sufficient - and consistent - demand to justify the expense. Ford has years of experience building different types of vehicles on one line, including versions of the Focus compact with gasoline engines and electric motors. Ford has installed a few collaborative robots at its recently renovated Louisville, Kentucky, truck plant. The company is also using digital tools such as including augmented reality to map new assembly lines, and predictive analytics to schedule repairs and maintenance before machines break down. The company has no immediate plans for a separate, highly automated plant for its next-generation electric vehicles, some of which are expected to share factory space with traditional combustion-engine models, according to sources familiar with Ford’s strategy. An April report by Barclays’ global auto investment team predicted “robots won’t kill all automotive jobs,” at least not in the near term.  Auto companies are working on “perfecting the combination of human and robot,” according to the report, because “the human touch is still necessary.” Even Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, who long praised robots’ virtues and promised to turn his California electric car factory into a highly automated “alien dreadnought,” has had something of an epiphany.     Bedeviled by technical glitches, Musk recently tweeted: “Excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake ... Humans are underrated.” Edward Taylor reported from Frankfurt, Germany, Norihiko Shirouzu reported from Shanghai and Nick Carey reported from Detroit; Written by Paul Lienert; Edited by Gerry Doyle",https://uk.reuters.com/article/autos-robotics/focus-the-auto-plants-of-the-future-may-have-a-surprisingly-human-touch-idUKL1N1S10YM,27 Apr 2018,"Carmakers have big plans for their next

2018-04-27,"TOKYO, April 27 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged lower on Friday, but Brent largely held gains from the previous session amid concerns that Iran may face renewed sanctions, choking off supply. Global benchmark Brent crude futures were down 13 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $74.61 a barrel by 0050 GMT, after rising 1 percent on Thursday U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 12 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $68.07 a barrel. The contract gained 0.2 percent the previous session. Brent is heading for a third week of gains, up around 0.7 percent, while WTI faces a small weekly decline. “Markets continued to price in potential disruptions to world oil supplies if the United States withdraws from the 2015 Nuclear Accord with Iran,” ANZ Bank said in a note.

2018-04-27,"TOKYO, April 27 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged lower on Friday, but Brent largely held gains from the previous session amid concerns that Iran may face renewed sanctions, choking off supply. Global benchmark Brent crude futures were down 13 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $74.61 a barrel by 0050 GMT, after rising 1 percent on Thursday U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 12 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $68.07 a barrel. The contract gained 0.2 percent the previous session. Brent is heading for a third week of gains, up around 0.7 percent, while WTI faces a small weekly decline. “Markets continued to price in potential disruptions to world oil supplies if the United States withdraws from the 2015 Nuclear Accord with Iran,” ANZ Bank said in a note.

2018-04-27,"* MSCI Asia-Pacific up 0.3 pct, Nikkei up 0.4 pct * Amazon shares jump in after-market trade as revenue surges * Euro steady near 3-1/2 month low after ECB meeting By Masayuki Kitano SINGAPORE, April 27 (Reuters) - Asian shares edged higher on Friday, after U.S. equities were buoyed by solid quarterly earnings and a rebound in technology stocks, while the euro languished near three-month lows after the European Central Bank kept interest rates unchanged. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3 percent. Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.4 percent, while South Korea’s KOSPI climbed 1.1 percent. U.S. stocks advanced on Thursday with each of Wall Street’s major indexes ending the session up 1 percent or higher, while Amazon.com Inc shares jumped more than 6 percent in after-market trading after the online retailer reported a 43 percent surge in first-quarter revenue. The S&P 500 rose 1 percent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 1.6 percent. Facebook surged 9.1 percent after posting an impressive earnings beat, which appeared to calm worries about the fallout from its use of consumer data. So far, 45 percent of S&P 500 companies have reported first-quarter earnings, with 79.7 percent beating consensus estimates. Analysts see 23.1 percent earnings growth for the quarter, based on a blend of actual and estimated results. The yield on U.S. 10-year Treasuries closed below the 3 percent level on Thursday as buyers emerged following a sell-off fuelled by worries over growing U.S. debt issuance and rising costs. The 10-year Treasury yield’s spike to four-year highs above 3 percent this week had weighed on equities, amid concerns that rising corporate borrowing costs could dampen profits. In currency markets, the euro languished near a 3-1/2-month low after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi hailed “solid” euro zone growth but kept interest rates unchanged. The euro held steady at $1.2105. On Thursday it touched a low of $1.20965, its lowest level since Jan. 12. Weaker-than-expected economic data out of the euro zone has cast some doubt as to how quickly the ECB can head toward policy normalisation and weighed on the euro recently. “The euro zone’s economy doesn’t seem to have the type of momentum it had last year,” said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore. The euro has shed roughly 1.5 percent this week, after a rise in U.S. Treasury yields fired up dollar-buying and encouraged some to question whether the euro’s rally since last year had run out of steam. The dollar stood at 91.591 against a basket of six major currencies, trading near a 3-1/2 month high of 91.637 struck on Thursday. Against the yen, the dollar held steady at 109.29 yen , having pulled back from a 2-1/2 month high of 109.49 yen set on Thursday. The Bank of Japan is not expected to change settings its policy decision expected at around 0330-0500 GMT on Friday, although the debut of a dovish new deputy could widen a rift between advocates of continued stimulus and those wary of the rising costs of prolonged easing. Oil prices gained on Thursday as the risk of renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran, plunging Venezuelan output, and robust global demand shook off the effects of a strong dollar. Global benchmark Brent crude futures gained 1 percent on Thursday to settle at $74.74 a barrel.

2018-04-27,"(Adds fire being put out, quote from mayor) By Stephanie Kelly and Erwin Seba NEW YORK/HOUSTON, April 26 (Reuters) - An explosion at Husky Energy’s refinery in Superior, Wisconsin, caused a fire that burned for several hours on Thursday and sent smoke billowing into the air, prompting the evacuation of thousands of residents, officials said. Local media said at least 15 people were injured but no fatalities were reported. All of the refinery’s workers were accounted for, Husky said. After flames were extinguished, an evacuation order remained in effect as officials verify the area is safe, Superior Mayor Jim Paine told a news conference. “This was the nightmare scenario” for the city of 27,000 people, he said. At least 10 people were taken to area hospitals, one of whom was seriously injured, said a spokeswoman for Essentia Health-St. Mary’s Medical Center, which operates hospitals in Superior and nearby Duluth, Minnesota. After an initial blaze, a storage tank was punctured, and a second fire erupted, Husky Energy spokesman Mel Duvall said. Firefighters tried to prevent flames from spreading by spraying water on nearby tanks, manager Kollin Schade said at a briefing. The refinery, which can process up to 38,000 barrels of oil a day, had additional workers on site preparing for a plant-wide overhaul, he said. The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board has sent a four-person team to investigate. The non-regulatory federal agency investigates serious chemical accidents such as refinery fires. As a precautionary measure, local officials ordered all residents within a three-mile radius around the refinery to evacuate. Friday classes were canceled in Superior and nearby Maple school districts, also as a precaution, officials said. “The lights flickered three times and the whole building shook,” said Jim Ronning, owner of Hudy’s Tavern in Superior, located about a mile (1.6 km) from the facility. “You can still smell a real caustic smell in the air,” said Sara Haugen, owner of Pudge’s bar in Superior, located about 135 miles (220 km) from Minneapolis, Minnesota. “There’s a big black plume of smoke coming out. Husky purchased the refinery from Calumet Specialty Products Partners LP last year, saying at the time that it intended to keep all of its workforce of 180. It produces asphalt, gasoline, diesel and heavy fuel oils, largely using heavy crude oil imported from Canada. Husky shares fell 8 percent to C$17.54 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the same day it reported financial results.

2018-04-27,"* Merkel aims to cultivate relationship on working trip * Trade tariffs and Iran nuclear deal are her focus * Trump wants Germany to increase NATO funding By Paul Carrel and Jeff Mason BERLIN/WASHINGTON, April 27 (Reuters) - Germany’s Angela Merkel visits U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday with no illusions of matching his “special relationship” with France’s Emmanuel Macron, but hoping to foster a broader dialogue on trade - one of a batch of tricky topics likely to be addressed. The cautious Merkel has failed to establish a good personal rapport with the brash Trump, and the mood music of her one-day working visit to the White House will almost certainly contrast sharply with the tactile “bromance” between Trump and Macron. Yet her trip may prove more productive. Before heading home after a three-day state visit in Washington, Macron acknowledged that, despite his efforts to dissuade Trump from pulling out of the multinational Iran nuclear deal, he remained likely to do so. The Iran deal, looming U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminium products, a planned Russian gas pipeline running under the Baltic Sea to Germany, and Berlin’s military spending are issues that divide Merkel and Trump and likely to come up at their working lunch. “The chancellor is pleased about this appointment because she is a convinced Atlanticist,” a senior German official said. “It is important to cultivate this relationship.” In Washington, a White House official described Germany as one of the United States’ closest partners and a steadfast NATO ally, adding: “All of Washington is ready to work with Chancellor Merkel’s new government.” Ahead of the trip, German officials said they expected U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminium products to kick in on May 1, when an exemption expires. But they said Germany would try to negotiate a broad package including other industries. “I think the chancellor would prefer a broad dialogue with the Americans. The government is open to extending the package to other duties and trade barriers,” one official added. In Washington, a White House official said the United States would press Germany about trade deficits that “pose risks to global economic stability”, and “would like to remove barriers ... to trade so that we can level the playing field”. “We want to work with Berlin on global unfair trading practices because those are impacting our economies in equal measure,” he said. BURDEN-SHARING The White House official said Trump would press Merkel to increase Germany’s funding for NATO, a subject he has pushed since taking office. “We will ask Germany to step up on burden-sharing,” the official said, adding that NATO needed to be strong and prepared to address a host of major foreign policy issues including Syria, Iran, China and Russia. In Berlin, the German officials made clear that Merkel was not ready to roll over when faced with Trump’s criticism of Germany’s trade position or the planned Nord Stream 2 pipeline. “Our analysis is ... that (the pipeline) does not make us more dependent on Russia,” one of the officials said. EU countries are divided on the merits of Nord Stream 2. Trump could seize on this, as well as Germany’s slow progress in moving closer to the NATO defence spending target. On Iran, Macron made the running ahead of Merkel’s visit. On Wednesday, he called on the United States not to abandon the Iran deal as Western envoys said Britain, France and Germany were nearing agreeing a package they hope could persuade Trump to save the pact. This gives Merkel something to work with. “How harshly the whole thing will unfold might depend on to what extent Merkel can steer the conversation in the direction of trade and Iran,” Jan Techau, a director at The German Marshall Fund of the United States. “Those are the fields in which her position is stronger because the Europeans are united and Macron has done the prep work.” (Additional reporting by Andreas Rinke and Andrea Shalal; writing by Paul Carrel; editing by Andrew Roche)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-germany/merkel-visits-trump-without-illusions-but-with-hope-idUKL8N1S3941,27 Apr 2018,"Germany's Angela

2018-04-27,"(Repeats with no changes to text) * Possible port closure may lead to slower pace of imports * May, June crude imports likely to drop from record April volumes * Private refiners ramped up purchases in late April * Survey shows at least 10 pct of capacity will be shut in Q2 * For FACTBOX on outages, see: By Meng Meng and Josephine Mason BEIJING, April 26 (Reuters) - Some of China’s top refineries will shut in May and June for maintenance, cutting nationwide throughput by some 10 percent and dampening oil demand in the world’s largest crude importer after record run levels in March, according to a Reuters survey. At least six state-owned and private refiners are planning a full annual maintenance shutdown in the second quarter for 30 days or more, including China’s largest refiner Sinopec’s Zhenhai unit, a Reuters survey of 11 plants showed. A slowdown in China’s refining activity could result in lower Chinese imports of crude oil, which in turn could undercut a two-month price rally that has lifted crude to more than $75 a barrel for the first time in over three years. Analysts and traders say imports may also be disrupted by a shutdown of major oil import hub Huangdao, part of Qingdao port in northern Shandong province, further crimping consumption. “If Shandong prepares to shut down the Huangdao port, crude arrivals could start dropping starting in late May,” said Emma Li, senior analyst at Thomson Reuters Oil Research. Port authorities declined to comment on what measures they might take ahead the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit in Qingdao in June. Qingdao is a major commodities port, and Beijing usually adopts tighter pollution controls and curbs shipping traffic for big events to ensure blue skies. In total, the six plants to be fully shutdown process around 1.09 million barrels per day (bpd), accounting for 10 percent of China’s average monthly crude runs, Reuters calculations based on refinery rates from China’s statistics bureau showed. The pace of outages due to maintenance is down from 1.26 million bpd in the same period last year, Reuters calculations also showed. But the actual volume of outages could grow as a flurry of independent refineries are considering undertaking maintenance in June and early July to avoid the potential pollution curbs. The early start could prolong China’s annual maintenance season. Independent refiners, often known as teapots, typically carry out their routine repairs later in the summer. “Usually the maintenance period falls in July and August, but this year we are planning one in June,” a crude purchasing manager with a Shandong-based refiner said. The outages and potential slowdown in demand will likely put brakes on China’s voracious appetite for crude oil as refineries have been churning out fuel at a record pace to take advantage of bumper profit margins. Trade data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows China will likely take in more than 9 million bpd of crude in April, its most ever. Some of those arrivals are spill-overs from March due to a backlog at Qingdao, Li said, and some private refiners might have already bought more to prepare for any disruption at the port. Crude arrivals in May 2017 fell more than 4 percent from April last year due to Chinese refiners’ maintenance plans. Further denting forward crude demand is that many of the teapot refiners, including Tianhong Chemical and Haiyou, will undertake maintenance this year. Shandong Haike Group will also close for the whole of June, an official at the plant told Reuters. And another ten private refiners will shut between April and June, data from energy consultancy JLC’s own survey showed. The 13 plants together have a total of 400,000 bpd in capacity. “We are seeing a drop ... for May crude cargoes from private refiners,” said Zhou Guoxia, a senior energy analyst at JLC.
