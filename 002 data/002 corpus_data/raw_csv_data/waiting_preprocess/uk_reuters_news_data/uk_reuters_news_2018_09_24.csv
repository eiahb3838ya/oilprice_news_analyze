2018-09-24,"(Reuters) - Iberdrola SA, the world’s biggest wind power producer, plans to expand its renewable capacity in the United States by about 50 percent over four years as part of the Spanish electric utility’s global plan to reduce carbon emissions, its chief executive told Reuters on Monday. Ignacio Galan, who was in New York to speak at the United Nations’ Global Compact Leaders Summit, said the company expects to spend about $15 billion in the United States on its transmission and distribution system and increase its renewable generation to around 10,000 megawatts (MW) by the end of 2022. “More and more investors are looking for companies with clean energy and sustainability goals,” Galan said, noting Iberdrola sells the energy that helps those companies meet those targets. Iberdrola committed to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions intensity by 50 percent by 2030 compared to 2007 levels and become carbon neutral by 2050. More than half of its 48,800 MW of generation around the world is renewable with the remainder fueled mostly by natural gas, nuclear and coal. Galan said the company wants to shut its last two coal plants, which are located in Spain, by 2020. Through its majority-owned Avangrid Inc subsidiary, Iberdrola has over 6,500 MW of renewables in the United States. It is the country’s third-biggest wind power provider behind NextEra Energy and Berkshire Hathaway. One megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes. Galan said Avangrid’s customer base was changing as more companies seek to buy energy directly from wind farms to meet climate change and sustainability goals. “In recent years, large customers are also coming to us to buy renewable power directly because it is cheaper and cleaner,” Galan said, noting Iberdrola has long-term power purchase agreements with companies including Amazon.com, Alphabet’s Google and Nike. Although most wind farms Iberdrola plans to build in the United States are onshore, the company is developing Vineyard Wind off Massachusetts, the country’s first big offshore wind farm. Galan said Vineyard Wind would cost $2.5 billion-$2.7 billion and is on schedule to begin construction in 2019 and become operational in 2021 and 2022. The 800-MW wind farm would be about 15 miles (24 km) south of Martha’s Vineyard. Iberdrola is also developing an offshore wind farm in North Carolina and in other U.S. East Coast states and a $950-million power transmission line to transport up to 1,200 MW of renewable energy from Quebec to New England.

2018-09-24,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock markets around the world retreated on Monday amid concerns over the potential wider impact of a trade spat between China and the United States, while oil prices rallied to a four-year high after OPEC ignored U.S. calls to raise supply.     Wall Street equities also stumbled on a wave of uncertainty over the future of U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election.  The White House said President Donald Trump and Rosenstein are scheduled to meet on Thursday to discuss Rosenstein’s future. The White House announced the meeting after a flurry of conflicting media reports on whether Rosenstein had resigned. The New York Times last week reported that Rosenstein had suggested secretly recording Trump in 2017 and recruiting Cabinet members to invoke a constitutional amendment to remove him from office. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 181.45 points, or 0.68 percent, to 26,562.05, the S&P 500 lost 10.3 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,919.37, and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.29 points, or 0.08 percent, to 7,993.25. Investors were also factoring in a widely expected interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve at its two-day meeting that begins on Tuesday. U.S. Treasury yields across maturities briefly fell by around two basis points after an initial report that Rosenstein had resigned before ticking back up.  Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 6/32 in price to yield 3.0907 percent, from 3.068 percent late on Friday. In European equities markets, the benchmark index for euro zone blue chip stocks retreated nearly 0.6 percent. China and the United States, the world’s two biggest economies, imposed a new round of tariffs on each other’s goods on Monday, showing no signs of backing down from an increasingly bitter trade dispute that is expected to knock back global economic growth. “Investors are starting to see the writing on the wall that China is starting to dig in its heels and so is the U.S,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, in Charlotte, North Carolina. “It’s a general risk-off tone, a sense that people are becoming a little bit more cautious.” Brexit, as Britain’s planned exit from the European Union is known, also weighed on sentiment. On Friday, British Prime Minister Theresa May said talks with the EU had hit an impasse.     British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Sunday he would support a second Brexit referendum if his Labour Party is supportive, heaping more pressure on May, amid speculation that she could opt to call a snap parliamentary election.      European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said he expected a vigorous pickup in euro zone inflation, backing moves toward unwinding an ECB asset purchase program meant to stimulate the economy. That drove the euro to a more than three-month high against the dollar. The dollar index rose 0.04 percent. Oil prices jumped more than 3 percent to a four-year high after Saudi Arabia and Russia ruled out any immediate increase in production despite calls by Trump for action to raise global supply. U.S. crude rose 2.12 percent to $72.28 per barrel and Brent was last at $81.47, up 3.39 percent.

2018-09-24,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.AS) and other companies will gather on Friday in possibly their last crack at Brazil’s coveted offshore oil for another four years, as a wide-open election spurs fears about barriers to foreign investment.  The auction in Rio de Janeiro for four blocks in the Santos and Campos basins comes just a week before the most unpredictable presidential election in a generation, which features candidates that may seek to slow the pace of oil auctions, revise market-friendly legislation or even claw back oil areas already handed out. “They can try to revise the whole process of opening up (the oil industry) to international oil companies,” said an oil services industry executive, who declined to be named. Lured by world class geology, shrinking reserves elsewhere, and rising oil prices, companies have dropped big money on Brazil, Latin America’s top oil producer, to lock in stakes to its pre-salt layer, where billions of barrels of oil are trapped under a thick layer of salt offshore. China’s CNOOC (0883.HK), Chevron Corp (CVX.N), BP (BP.L), Norway’s Equinor (EQNR.OL), and France’s Total (TOTF.PA) are also all registered to participate in the auction.  Their interest has been fanned by industry-friendly policies under center-right President Michel Temer, including a loosening of rules that had favored local suppliers, an extension of tax sweeteners, and the removal of a requirement that state oil giant Petrobras (PETR4.SA) be sole operator in pre-salt blocks.  Fears of a rollback of such policies should encourage big bets on Friday, according to Edmar Almeida, an energy professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. “It will be a hotly contested auction,” he said.  Presidential right-wing frontrunner Jair Bolsonaro has said little about the oil sector, although as a congressman he once voted against easing Petrobras’ oil monopoly. He has floated the idea of privatizing Petrobras and has indicated that he will champion a market-friendly approach if he wins.  However, opinion polls indicate that a likely run-off vote on Oct. 28 would be a close contest. Fernando Haddad, a leftist academic who has climbed into the No. 2 spot after an endorsement from jailed former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has a much more nationalistic view of the industry. Vowing to “recover the pre-salt to serve the future of the Brazilian people, not the interests of international companies,” according to his platform, he would restore stricter requirements for using local suppliers.  It is unclear if Haddad would also adopt Lula’s pledge to revert to giving Petrobras the sole right to operate pre-salt fields and slow the pace of pre-salt auctions. Ciro Gomes, a leftist former state governor in third place, has threatened to freeze auctions and expropriate blocks already handed out. If Haddad or Gomes win, “we can say goodbye to auctions,” said another oil industry executive, who asked not be named. “They want to renationalize everything. It will be hell,” he said.  The prospect of another shift in oil policy is already frustrating authorities. “Our country has to stop missing opportunities. It seems that we do not have a sense of urgency,” said Decio Oddone, director-general of oil regulator ANP, at an event in Rio de Janeiro on Monday. “We are full of natural resources yet we do not exploit them ... We discuss whether to explore for oil and gas or not as if we do not need it.” Oddone vowed to finish out his term as ANP’s chief until 2020, no matter who wins the election.  The fiercest bids this week are expected to be for the Tita and Saturno blocks in the Santos basin, which were withdrawn by a court from a prior auction in March, disappointing Exxon. Both Pau Brasil in the Santos basin, and the Southwest of Tartaruga Verde in the Campos basin received no bids in an auction last year. But this time, Petrobras exercised its right of first refusal to bid for the Tartaruga Verde block, adjacent to an area it already owns. Under Brazilian rules, Petrobras can express advance interest in operating a block where it would control at least a 30 percent stake, though it can still bid on other blocks on the day of the auction.  Companies will compete by pledging the greatest share of oil - subtracting overhead costs - to the government, with minimums ranging from 9.5 percent to 35 percent.

2018-09-24,"(Adds details on the contract, comments by CME executive, background) Sept 24 (Reuters) - CME Group Inc on Monday joined the race to provide oil traders with a futures contract deliverable in the U.S. Gulf Coast, as crude exports have surged since the lifting of a decades-old ban. The company said it will offer a new WTI Houston crude futures contract with three physical delivery locations on the Enterprise Products Partners LP’s Houston system, beginning in the fourth quarter. The new WTI Houston futures contract will be listed with and subject to the rules of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), beginning with the January 2019 contract month. “It’s going to be a primarily commercial contract to start with – we’re seeing this as something that will be of interest to producers, exporters and importers,” said Owain Johnson, managing director of energy research at CME. The WTI Houston contract’s specifications will be about 40-44 degrees API gravity and 0.275 percent sulfur. Benchmark U.S. crude futures are currently deliverable at Cushing, Oklahoma. However, the growth in exports has underscored the hub’s waning influence as the primary measuring stick for the U.S. oil market and the leading barometer of future supply, demand and prices. CME’s announcement comes after rival Intercontinental Exchange said in July it would offer a crude futures contract deliverable at Magellan Midstream Partners’ East Houston terminal. Record U.S. crude production and exports this year have put the spotlight on the Gulf Coast, and in particular Houston, as a vital pricing center. The United States lifted a 40-year ban on crude oil exports in late 2015 and since then tankers filled with U.S. crude have landed in more than 30 countries. CME expects market participants to trade its new Houston contract largely as a spread and as a result, boost liquidity in its Cushing contract as well. “We’re not seeing this as in any way a replacement for Cushing,” Johnson said. “It’s an enhancement to Cushing.” Reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in New York

Wall Street equities tumbled after the Axios news site reported that U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had verbally resigned to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, in anticipation of being fired by President Donald Trump. Other media sites had similar reports.

MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.46 percent. U.S. Treasury yields across maturities briefly fell by around two basis points after the report about Rosenstein, who overseas the federal investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 U.S. election and had reportedly suggested secretly recording Trump. Yields ticked back up, however. The benchmark 10-year notes last fell 3/32 in price to yield 3.0796 percent, from 3.068 percent late on Friday. The benchmark index for euro zone blue chip stocks retreated 0.62 percent, while the pan-European STOXX 600, which also includes stocks in Britain and outside the European Union, was down 0.6 percent. Europe had followed Asia lower, with MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closing 1.1 percent lower, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.82 percent. China and the United States, the world’s two biggest economies, imposed fresh tariffs on each other’s goods on Monday, showing no signs of backing down from an increasingly bitter trade dispute that is expected to knock back global economic growth. “This is here to stay,” said Adrien Dumas, a manager at Mandarine Gestion in Paris, arguing that because trade is at the core of the Trump administration’s agenda, investors should accept that the issue is unlikely to recede any time soon. “It’s a negative and it adds to other issues,” he said, pointing to stress in emerging markets or political risk in Italy and Britain. A worsening trade environment is also likely to exacerbate diverging economic performance and policy rates between different regions, Citi analysts said in a note on Monday. “The U.S. economy is moving full steam ahead, bolstered by pro-cyclical policies, while others are lagging,” they said. Brexit, or Britain’s exit from the European Union, weighed on sentiment. On Friday, British Prime Minister Theresa May said talks with the EU had hit an impasse.

2018-09-24,"LONDON (Reuters) - A group of the world’s top oil and gas companies pledged on Monday to slash emissions of a potent greenhouse gas by a fifth by 2025 in an effort to battle climate change. The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), which U.S. giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron joined recently, committed to cutting  methane emissions to an intensity of 0.25 percent of the group’s total fossil fuel production, it said in a statement. Such a reduction would equate to 350,000 tonnes of methane annually. It compares with a baseline intensity of 0.32 percent in 2017, excluding new members. The pledge, which could be lowered further to 0.20 percent intensity, echoes targets set individually by members BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon to reduce methane emissions. “Our aim is to work towards near zero methane emissions from the full gas value chain in support of achieving the goals of the Paris (Climate) Agreement,” the heads of the OGCI members said in a statement, referring to an international agreement aimed at limiting global warming.  The OGCI today represents nearly a third of global oil and gas production. It also includes BP, Royal Dutch Shell, France’s Total as well as national oil companies of China, Mexico, Brazil and Saudi Arabia. The U.S.-based Environment Defense Fund (EDF), a non-governmental organisation, said OGCI needs to adopt more, and transparent, ways of measuring methane emissions to meet the target. “It will be critical now for companies to follow through on their commitment, reporting on progress with actual measured emissions, fully and publicly disclosed,” EDF President Fred Krupp said in a statement.     “A second challenge for OGCI is the risk that laggards in the industry hide behind their efforts, falsely claiming that the actions of an important few represent what all in the industry are doing.” In a separate announcement, timed to coincide with the start of Climate Week in New York, OGCI announced the creation of a $100 million China-focused climate investment fund with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). The group is investing in new technologies, including satellite imagery, to help measure and detect methane leaks from pipelines, wells and other infrastructure, said Pratima Rangarajan, head of OGCI Climate Investments.  “Today there is no global measurement, so what you don’t measure you don’t fix or operate as well as you should,” she told Reuters in an interview.

2018-09-24,"WARSAW, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Poland’s energy ministry plans to add German-owned Innogy Stoen Operator, an electric power distributor, to a list of assets deemed important for the country’s energy security which prevents them being sold without Warsaw’s consent. If it is added, then under a 2015 law Innogy would have to ask the ministry for approval if it wanted to sell the business. The government’s list includes state-run copper producer KGHM , chemicals group Azoty and power firms. “The energy minister has proposed that Innogy Stoen Operator would fall under the 2015 law,” a ministry spokeswoman said. Two years ago the Polish government, which has been buying back assets from foreign investors, put local energy assets owned by French EDF and Engie on the list in order to block their sale to private investors. Eventually the energy ministry prevented the sale of the EDF business to two private investors - Australia’s IFM Investors and Czech utility EPH, citing concerns over the country’s energy security. Polish state-run utilities bought the French assets. German energy group Innogy was carved out of RWE two years ago. RWE had bought an 85-percent stake in Warsaw power distributor Stoen for 1.5 billion zlotys in 2002. Polish newspaper Dziennik Gazeta Prawna said on Monday that the Polish government would like Innogy Stoen Operator to become state-run again and that Poland’s biggest power group, the state-run PGE might be the buyer.

2018-09-24,"PARIS (Reuters) - French oil and energy group Total (TOTF.PA) said on Monday it had made a major gas discovery on the Glendronach prospect, located off the coast of the Shetland islands in the North Sea. Total said preliminary tests on the new gas discovery confirmed good reservoir quality, permeability and well production deliverability, with recoverable resources estimated at about one trillion cubic feet (1 tcf). It said Glendronach, located near its Edradour field, will be tied back to the existing infrastructure and developed quickly and at low cost. Total said the discovery will extend the life of the West of Shetland infrastructure and production hub which includes the Laggan, Tormore, Edradour & Glenlivet fields, as well as the Shetland Gas plant, all of which contribute to about 7 percent of the UK gas consumption.          “Glendronach is a significant discovery for Total which gives us access to additional gas resources in one of our core areas and validates our exploration strategy,” Arnaud Breuillac, President of Total’s Exploration & Production division, said in a statement. Wood Mackenzie North Sea research analyst Kevin Swann said it was the largest conventional discovery in the United Kingdom since Culzean in 2008, and it could contribute as much as 10 percent of the UK’s annual gas production in its early years. “Exploration in the UK has been a huge concern so far in 2018 with just five exploration wells spudded to date – on track for lowest levels of activity since the 1960s. So this discovery is welcome news,” Swann said in a statement. He said that although the West of Shetland region was under-explored, it was core for oil majors BP (BP.L), Shell (RDSa.AS), Total and Chevron (CVX.N), and large development projects were expected to boost production from it through to the mid-2020s. Total has a 60 percent stake in Glendronach, while Ineos [INEOSE.UL] E&P UK Ltd and SSE (SSE.L) E&P UK Limited each hold 20 percent stakes. Total shares were up 0.9 percent by 1418 GMT.

2018-09-24,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Eleven years ago, on Monday Sept. 24, 2007, the price of Brent crude closed just below $79 per barrel, not far from where it is today. Three days later, Brent closed above $80 for the first time in history. Less than 10 months after that, prices closed at an all-time high of $146. Past prices are not necessarily a guide to the future, but the events of 2007/08 are a reminder that price moves are highly non-linear, especially around turning points in the cycle. Price moves tend to accelerate in the run-up to cyclical peaks and troughs, as the market struggles to overcome a worsening deficit or surplus. As a result, oil prices tend to rise far higher, and fall much further, than commentators thought possible just a few months earlier. The current situation in the global economy and the oil market has many similarities to what happened in 2007 and 2008. In the earlier episode, the global economy had been expanding strongly for several years, with rapid growth in oil consumption. The U.S. economic cycle peaked in December 2007, though that was not evident until about a year afterwards, and oil prices continued rising for another seven months. Yields on short-term U.S. Treasury notes peaked around June 2007 and U.S. equity markets hit their pinnacle in October 2007. Most of the other major industrial economies tipped into recession in the second half of 2007 or the first half of 2008. In the oil market, persistent concerns about demand destruction were raised, but dismissed by many participants, and validated only after prices peaked. The introduction of new low-sulphur standards for distillate fuel oil in the United States led to concerns about the availability of enough sweet crude. There were mounting concerns about the exhaustion of OPEC’s spare capacity and the organisation’s ability to add more medium-sweet barrels to meet demand from refiners. Throughout 2007 and early 2008, OPEC leaders continued to insist the oil market was adequately supplied and they would make additional barrels available if refiners requested them. But the Brent market moved into a sharp backwardation in the second half of 2007 and the first four months of 2008, indicating traders were concerned about oil availability. In September 2007, OPEC agreed to increase its collective production by 500,000 barrels per day from the start of November, citing the tightness in U.S. fuel markets and the shift in crude futures into backwardation. In December 2007, however, OPEC’s conference judged the market remained well supplied and that crude and product stocks were at comfortable levels and decided not to increase output further. In March 2008, the conference continued to judge the market well supplied, noting growing downside risks in the world economy, and blamed the continued rise in oil prices on non-fundamental factors, especially speculators. In May, the organisation’s secretary-general issued a statement saying “there is clearly no shortage of oil in the market” and blaming speculative funds for the increasing volatility in crude oil. The organisation promised to be proactive in monitoring developments and act if necessary to ensure a stable and balanced market but did not promise additional barrels. Prices continued to accelerate higher and became increasingly volatile, with $5-per-day price moves becoming frequent, and many traders pulling back from making markets due to the increase in risk. OPEC insisted throughout that oil supplies were adequate, Saudi Arabia and other members would provide more oil, if refiners asked, but that prices were being driven by non-fundamental factors. Eventually, the backwardation began to break down in May and spot prices started to fall from early July as the financial and economic outlook deteriorated. With the intensification of the financial crisis in September 2008, the global economy headed deeper into recession through the second half of the year and in the first half of 2009. Could the same sequence of events play out in 2018/19? The U.S. economy and financial markets are again at a relatively late stage in the current cyclical expansion. In the rest of the world, the global outlook is softening, with the balance of risks tilted towards the downside, according to many forecasters. Oil consumption growth has been strong but may be starting to soften, though as usual this will not be certain until after the event. Six-month Brent calendar spreads are trading in a backwardation of around $2 per barrel, which is comparable to the corresponding point in September 2007. New pollution regulations will tighten sulphur specifications for marine fuels from the start of 2020, which will put pressure on the availability of medium-density and sweet crudes. There are reported shortages of medium crudes as imminent sanctions reduce the export of medium-density oil from Iran (“Saudi Arabia worries oil crunch could push up prices”, Wall Street Journal”, Sept. 21). Saudi Arabia says it has enough spare capacity to increase production by another 1.5 million barrels per day but some market participants are sceptical about the amount and the quality. The Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee of OPEC and non-OPEC producers concluded on Sunday the overall balance between supply and demand remains healthy. But hedge funds have amassed a large bullish position in Brent crude, amounting to almost 470 million barrels, betting prices will head even higher.

2018-09-24,"* OGCI members to cut methane emissions to 0.25 pct intensity * Group also creates China-focused investment fund By Ron Bousso LONDON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - A group of the world’s top oil and gas companies pledged on Monday to slash emissions of a potent greenhouse gas by a fifth by 2025 in an effort to battle climate change. The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), which U.S. giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron joined recently, committed to cutting methane emissions to an intensity of 0.25 percent of the group’s total fossil fuel production, it said in a statement. Such a reduction would equate to 350,000 tonnes of methane annually. It compares with a baseline intensity of 0.32 percent in 2017, excluding new members. The pledge, which could be lowered to 0.20 percent intensity, echoes targets set individually by members BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon to reduce methane emissions. “Our aim is to work towards near zero methane emissions from the full gas value chain in support of achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement,” the heads of the OGCI members said in a statement, referring to an international agreement aimed at limiting global warming. “We have worked to make our ambition concrete, actionable and measurable, helping to ensure that natural gas can realize its full potential in a low-emissions future.” The OGCI today represents nearly a third of global oil and gas production. It also includes BP, Royal Dutch Shell, France’s Total as well as national oil companies of China, Mexico, Brazil and Saudi Arabia. In a separate announcement, timed to coincide with the start of Climate Week in New York, OGCI announced the creation of a $100 million China-focused climate investment fund with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC).

2018-09-24,"LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and Russia won’t add significantly more oil to the market because of a lack of capacity, a top Iranian official said on Monday, predicting prices will probably rise further. On Sunday, ministers and officials from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus Russia and other allies ruled out an immediate oil-output boost, in effect rebuffing U.S. President Donald Trump’s calls for action. The move helped push crude prices LOc1 to a four-year high near $81 a barrel on Monday. Also underpinning the market is the prospect of lower exports from Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, due to U.S. sanctions. Iran’s OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, said in comments to Reuters that Saudi Arabia and Russia were unable and unwilling to add more production at short notice. “They are doing little and late, to get prices higher,” he said. “They got prices higher and they are going to get them higher still.” “There is no spare capacity. They cannot deliver the extra capacity that they claim.” Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest producer, says it can add an extra 1.5 million barrels per day - about 1.5 percent of world demand - to the market. But Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Sunday such a move was not needed at the moment. Sunday’s meeting appeared to leave unresolved a disagreement which flared up in June between Saudi Arabia and Iran over whether OPEC members are allowed to pump more oil to make up shortfalls elsewhere.  Under pressure from Trump, OPEC and allies agreed in June to boost production, after months of undersupply by OPEC countries including Venezuela and Angola and the prospect of the Iran sanctions. Saudi Arabia said the deal allowed countries able to produce more, such as itself, to go ahead and do so, to make up for shortfalls. Iran disagreed and Kazempour maintained that position on Monday. “Extra production beyond OPEC quotas requires permission of the conference,” he said. “Assignment of OPEC share to non-OPEC requires conference approval.” The next meeting of the conference - the full group of OPEC and non-OPEC ministers, is not until December. The OPEC governor is typically the second most senior post in a country’s OPEC delegation after the oil minister.  Iran’s minister, Bijan Zanganeh, was quoted on Monday as saying the meeting did not give a positive response to Trump.

2018-09-24,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp , Royal Dutch Shell Plc and other companies will gather on Friday in possibly their last crack at Brazil’s coveted offshore oil for another four years, as a wide-open election spurs fears about barriers to foreign investment. The auction in Rio de Janeiro for four blocks in the Santos and Campos basins comes just a week before the most unpredictable presidential election in a generation, which features candidates that may seek to slow the pace of oil auctions, revise market-friendly legislation or even claw back oil areas already handed out. “They can try to revise the whole process of opening up (the oil industry) to international oil companies,” said an oil services industry executive, who declined to be named. Lured by world class geology, shrinking reserves elsewhere, and rising oil prices, companies have dropped big money on Brazil, Latin America’s top oil producer, to lock in stakes to its pre-salt layer, where billions of barrels of oil are trapped under a thick layer of salt offshore. China’s CNOOC, Chevron Corp, BP, Norway’s Equinor, and France’s Total are also all registered to participate in the auction. Their interest has been fanned by industry-friendly policies under center-right President Michel Temer, including a loosening of rules that had favored local suppliers, an extension of tax sweeteners, and the removal of a requirement that state oil giant Petrobras be sole operator in pre-salt blocks. Fears of a rollback of such policies should encourage big bets on Friday, according to Edmar Almeida, an energy professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. “It will be a hotly contested auction,” he said. Presidential right-wing frontrunner Jair Bolsonaro has said little about the oil sector, although as a congressman he once voted against easing Petrobras’ oil monopoly. He has floated the idea of privatizing Petrobras and has indicated that he will champion a market-friendly approach if he wins. However, opinion polls indicate that a likely run-off vote on Oct. 28 would be a close contest. Fernando Haddad, a leftist academic who has climbed into the No. 2 spot after an endorsement from jailed former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has a much more nationalistic view of the industry. Vowing to “recover the pre-salt to serve the future of the Brazilian people, not the interests of international companies,” according to his platform, he would restore stricter requirements for using local suppliers. It is unclear if Haddad would also adopt Lula’s pledge to revert to giving Petrobras the sole right to operate pre-salt fields and slow the pace of pre-salt auctions. Ciro Gomes, a leftist former state governor in third place, has threatened to freeze auctions and expropriate blocks already handed out. If Haddad or Gomes win, “we can say goodbye to auctions,” said another oil industry executive, who asked not be named. “They want to renationalize everything. It will be hell,” he said. The fiercest bids this week are expected to be for the Tita and Saturno blocks in the Santos basin, which were withdrawn by a court from a prior auction in March, disappointing Exxon. Both Pau Brasil in the Santos basin, and the Southwest of Tartaruga Verde in the Campos basin received no bids in an auction last year. But this time, Petrobras exercised its right of first refusal to bid for the Tartaruga Verde block, adjacent to an area it already owns. Under Brazilian rules, Petrobras can express advance interest in operating a block where it would control at least a 30 percent stake, though it can still bid on other blocks on the day of the auction. Companies will compete by pledging the greatest share of oil - subtracting overhead costs - to the government, with minimums ranging from 9.5 percent to 35 percent.

2018-09-24,"(Reuters) - Iberdrola SA, the world’s biggest wind power producer, plans to expand its renewable capacity in the United States by about 50 percent over four years as part of the Spanish electric utility’s global plan to reduce carbon emissions, its chief executive told Reuters on Monday. Ignacio Galan, who was in New York to speak at the United Nations’ Global Compact Leaders Summit, said the company expects to spend about $15 billion in the United States on its transmission and distribution system and increase its renewable generation to around 10,000 megawatts (MW) by the end of 2022. “More and more investors are looking for companies with clean energy and sustainability goals,” Galan said, noting Iberdrola sells the energy that helps those companies meet those targets. Iberdrola committed to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions intensity by 50 percent by 2030 compared to 2007 levels and become carbon neutral by 2050. More than half of its 48,800 MW of generation around the world is renewable with the remainder fueled mostly by natural gas, nuclear and coal. Galan said the company wants to shut its last two coal plants, which are located in Spain, by 2020. Through its majority-owned Avangrid Inc subsidiary, Iberdrola has over 6,500 MW of renewables in the United States. It is the country’s third-biggest wind power provider behind NextEra Energy and Berkshire Hathaway. One megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes. Galan said Avangrid’s customer base was changing as more companies seek to buy energy directly from wind farms to meet climate change and sustainability goals. “In recent years, large customers are also coming to us to buy renewable power directly because it is cheaper and cleaner,” Galan said, noting Iberdrola has long-term power purchase agreements with companies including Amazon.com, Alphabet’s Google and Nike. Although most wind farms Iberdrola plans to build in the United States are onshore, the company is developing Vineyard Wind off Massachusetts, the country’s first big offshore wind farm. Galan said Vineyard Wind would cost $2.5 billion-$2.7 billion and is on schedule to begin construction in 2019 and become operational in 2021 and 2022. The 800-MW wind farm would be about 15 miles (24 km) south of Martha’s Vineyard. Iberdrola is also developing an offshore wind farm in North Carolina and in other U.S. East Coast states and a $950-million power transmission line to transport up to 1,200 MW of renewable energy from Quebec to New England.

2018-09-24,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock markets around the world retreated on Monday amid concerns over the potential wider impact of a trade spat between China and the United States, while oil prices rallied to a four-year high after OPEC ignored U.S. calls to raise supply.     Wall Street equities also stumbled on a wave of uncertainty over the future of U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election.  The White House said President Donald Trump and Rosenstein are scheduled to meet on Thursday to discuss Rosenstein’s future. The White House announced the meeting after a flurry of conflicting media reports on whether Rosenstein had resigned. The New York Times last week reported that Rosenstein had suggested secretly recording Trump in 2017 and recruiting Cabinet members to invoke a constitutional amendment to remove him from office. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 181.45 points, or 0.68 percent, to 26,562.05, the S&P 500 lost 10.3 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,919.37, and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.29 points, or 0.08 percent, to 7,993.25. Investors were also factoring in a widely expected interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve at its two-day meeting that begins on Tuesday. U.S. Treasury yields across maturities briefly fell by around two basis points after an initial report that Rosenstein had resigned before ticking back up.  Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 6/32 in price to yield 3.0907 percent, from 3.068 percent late on Friday. In European equities markets, the benchmark index for euro zone blue chip stocks retreated nearly 0.6 percent. China and the United States, the world’s two biggest economies, imposed a new round of tariffs on each other’s goods on Monday, showing no signs of backing down from an increasingly bitter trade dispute that is expected to knock back global economic growth. “Investors are starting to see the writing on the wall that China is starting to dig in its heels and so is the U.S,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, in Charlotte, North Carolina. “It’s a general risk-off tone, a sense that people are becoming a little bit more cautious.” Brexit, as Britain’s planned exit from the European Union is known, also weighed on sentiment. On Friday, British Prime Minister Theresa May said talks with the EU had hit an impasse.     British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Sunday he would support a second Brexit referendum if his Labour Party is supportive, heaping more pressure on May, amid speculation that she could opt to call a snap parliamentary election.      European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said he expected a vigorous pickup in euro zone inflation, backing moves toward unwinding an ECB asset purchase program meant to stimulate the economy. That drove the euro to a more than three-month high against the dollar. The dollar index rose 0.04 percent. Oil prices jumped more than 3 percent to a four-year high after Saudi Arabia and Russia ruled out any immediate increase in production despite calls by Trump for action to raise global supply. U.S. crude rose 2.12 percent to $72.28 per barrel and Brent was last at $81.47, up 3.39 percent.

2018-09-24,"NEW YORK, Sept 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The Marshall Islands, an atoll-nation vulnerable to sea level rise from climate change, announced steps on Monday towards an ambitious plan to cut its greenhouse emissions to zero by 2050. The Pacific country became the first small island nation to present such a strategy to the United Nations amid increasing interest from governments worldwide towards eliminating planet-warming emissions in a bid to curb man-made climate change. “If we can do it so can you,” Hilda Heine, Marshall Islands president, said at an event on the sidelines of the annual U.N. summit that featured a handful of heads of small island nations. The announcement came as more than 150 heads of state and government gathered on Monday for the annual United Nations General Assembly. Heine upped the pressure on world leaders to go beyond current pledges to reduce their heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions as agreed in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. “I challenge you all to develop your own vision to fully decarbonize by 2050,” she told an audience of climate policymakers and advocates brought together by U.S. non-profit The Climate Group. Worldwide, nine other countries have so far unveiled long-term plans to completely eradicate carbon emissions at home, from Britain to France and the United States under the administration of former U.S. president Barack Obama. Since then, the United States has become the only country to announce its intention to withdraw from the Paris pact, following a decision by President Donald Trump last year. The Paris accord aims to limit the rise in global temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), and ideally to 1.5 degrees Celsius, with a sweeping goal of ending the fossil fuel era this century. Aseem Prakash, founding director of the University of Washington’s Center for Environmental Politics, said the Marshall Islands’ move spoke to a growing trend around carbon neutrality by cities, companies, and now countries. Cities, regions and companies, including Indian conglomerate Mahindra and the state of California, made similar carbon-zero commitments in the run-up and at a global climate summit held in San Francisco earlier this month. The announcement was charged with symbolism, said Prakash, with the Marshall Islands contributing less than 0.00001 percent of the global total of emissions. The Marshall Islands’ net-zero strategy, in addition to seeking to slow climate change in the transport, electricity and waste sector, stresses the need to invest into adapting to freak weather events linked to global warming, from hurricanes to floods, said Heine. At the event New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern pledged $300 million over four years to help Pacific countries set up defenses to ward off the impact of climate change. ""The challenge of climate change requires us to look beyond our domestic borders,"" she said in a press release.

2018-09-24,"WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Monday dismissed Iran’s threats of revenge after Saturday’s deadly attack at a military parade in southwestern Iran and said it was “ludicrous” for Tehran to allege U.S. involvement. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday the attackers who killed 25 people at a military parade had been paid by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and that Iran would “severely punish” those behind the bloodshed. The deputy head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards also accused the United States and Israel of involvement in the attack and said they should expect a devastating response. Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon that Iran’s threat did not give him any concern. “We’ve been very clear that they shouldn’t take us on like that. And I am hopeful that cooler, wiser heads will prevail,” Mattis said. “They’ve so far blamed at least three countries and I think one terrorist group. We’ll see how long the list goes. But it’d be good if they knew what they’re talking about before they started talking.” In the southwestern city of Ahvaz, thousands packed the streets to mourn the victims of Saturday’s assault, many chanting “Death to Israel and America”. Twelve members of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were among the dead. The coffins, wrapped in flags, were carried by mourners. Many held pictures of a four-year-old boy killed in the incident, one of the worst such attacks against Iran’s most powerful military force. Iran’s Intelligence Ministry said some 22 people had been arrested in connection with the attack.   “Weapons, (explosives) material and communication equipment were seized in the house that belonged to the five-member terrorist group that carried out the attack,” a ministry statement said, according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency. Gunmen fired on a viewing stand in Ahvaz where officials had gathered to watch an annual parade marking the start of Iran’s 1980-88 war with Iraq. Fars and IRNA news agencies said on Monday five attackers were killed, not four as previously reported by state media. The body of the fifth assailant had not been identified as it was mixed up with other casualties, Fars said. “Based on reports, this cowardly act was done by people who the Americans come to help when they are trapped in Syria and Iraq, and are paid by Saudi Arabia and the UAE,” Khamenei said on his website. Guards Brigadier General Hossein Salami, in a speech broadcast on state TV, said: “You have seen our revenge before. You will see that our response will be crushing and devastating and you will regret what you have done.” Tasnim news agency quoted Salami as saying the “horrific crime” exposed the dark side of an alliance that the United States, Saudi Arabia and Israel had created to counter Iranian influence in the region. The secretary of Iran’s National Security Council said Tehran needed to talk to its neighbours to avoid tensions. “It’s essential to be fully aware and increase our constructive dialogues to neutralise the plots of enemies who want to create suspicion and disagreement among regional countries,” Ali Shamkhani said.  He also said U.S. sanctions against Iran were illegal and President Donald Trump was using them as a tool for “personal revenge”. Mattis said it was clear that Iran still didn’t know what had happened. He stressed the United States had no advance knowledge that such an attack was possible. “I don’t get woken up with phone calls over something we know is going to happen. It’s just ludicrous to say we had anything to do with it,” he said. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, asked by a Fox News interviewer if the United States played any role in the attack, said: “When you have a security incident at home, blaming others is an enormous mistake.” The loss of innocent lives was tragic, Pompeo added. There has been no reaction from Saudi Arabia or Israel. Accusations against Gulf countries will almost certainly antagonise Iran’s regional foe Saudi Arabia. The oil super-powers are waging a war for influence across the Middle East, backing opposite sides in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon. It is, however, highly unlikely the Guards will strike any of its foes directly and risk setting off a regional conflict. Analysts said the violence has led to a boost in domestic support for the Guards which they could use to silence their critics, who include pragmatic President Hassan Rouhani. Rouhani engineered Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that ushered in a cautious detente with Washington before tensions flared anew with Trump’s decision in May to pull out of the accord and reimpose sanctions on Tehran. Iran’s Intelligence Minister, Mahmoud Alavi, said a network of suspects had been arrested in connection with the attack, the judiciary’s news agency Mizan reported. He did not elaborate. Karim Dahimi, a human rights activist in London, told Reuters local sources had said more than 300 people had been arrested in the cities of Ahvaz, Khorramshahr and Abadan in recent days, mostly from the Sunni Muslim community. Ahvaz National Resistance, an Iranian ethnic Arab opposition movement which seeks a separate state in oil-rich Khuzestan province, and Islamic State have both claimed responsibility. The Guard Corps was set up after the 1979 Islamic revolution to protect the Shi’ite clerical ruling system and revolutionary values. It answers to Ayatollah Khamenei and has an estimated 125,000-strong military with army, navy and air units.

In European equities markets, the benchmark index for euro zone blue chip stocks retreated 0.6 percent, while the pan-European STOXX 600, which also includes stocks in Britain and outside the European Union, was down 0.56 percent. Europe had followed Asia lower, with MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closing 1.17 percent lower, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.82 percent. China and the United States, the world’s two biggest economies, implemented with fresh tariffs on each other’s goods on Monday, showing no signs of backing down from an increasingly bitter trade dispute that is expected to knock back global economic growth. “This is here to stay,” said Adrien Dumas, a manager at Mandarine Gestion in Paris, arguing that because trade is at the core of the Trump administration’s agenda, investors should accept that the issue is unlikely to recede any time soon. “It’s a negative and it adds to other issues,” he said, pointing to stress in emerging markets or political risk in Italy and Britain. A worsening trade environment is likely to exacerbate diverging economic performance and policy rates between different regions, Citi analysts said in a note on Monday. “The U.S. economy is moving full steam ahead, bolstered by pro-cyclical policies, while others are lagging,” they said. Brexit, as Britain’s planned exit from the European Union is known, weighed on sentiment. On Friday, British Prime Minister Theresa May said talks with the EU had hit an impasse. British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Sunday he would support a second Brexit referendum if his Labour Party backs the move, heaping more pressure on May, amid speculation that she could opt to call a snap parliamentary election. European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said he expected a vigorous pickup in euro zone inflation, backing moves toward unwinding an ECB asset purchase program meant to stimulate the economy. That drove the euro to a more than three-month high against the dollar. The dollar index fell 0.02 percent. Oil prices jumped more than 3 percent to a four-year high after Saudi Arabia and Russia ruled out any immediate increase in production despite calls by Trump for action to raise global supply.

2018-09-24,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global Benchmark Brent crude jumped more than 3 percent on Monday to a four-year high above $80 a barrel after Saudi Arabia and Russia ruled out any immediate increase in production despite calls by U.S. President Donald Trump for action to raise global supply. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and  non-OPEC states, including top producer Russia, gathered in Algiers on Sunday for a meeting that ended with no formal recommendation for any additional supply boost to counter falling supply from Iran. “The market’s still being driven by concerns about Iranian and Venezuelan supply,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford. “The failure of the producers to address that adequately this weekend is creating a buying opportunity.”  Brent crude LCOc1 settled up $2.40 or 3.1 percent at $81.20 a barrel, after touching an intraday high of $81.39, the highest since November, 2014. U.S. light crude CLc1 settled up $1.30, or 1.8 percent, higher at $72.08. (U.S. oil drilling, production & storage levels: tmsnrt.rs/2OKP4nJ)     OPEC leader Saudi Arabia and its biggest oil-producer ally outside the group, Russia, on Sunday effectively rebuffed Trump’s demand for moves to cool the market. “I do not influence prices,” Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters on Sunday. Trump said last week that OPEC “must get prices down now!”, but Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Monday OPEC had not responded positively to Trump’s demands. “It is now increasingly evident, that in the face of producers reluctant to raise output, the market will be confronted with supply gaps in the next three-six months that it will need to resolve through higher oil prices,” BNP Paribas oil strategist Harry Tchilinguirian told Reuters Global Oil Forum. Commodity traders Trafigura and Mercuria said Brent could rise to $90 per barrel by Christmas and pass $100 in early 2019, as markets tighten once U.S. sanctions against Iran are fully implemented from November. JPMorgan said U.S. sanctions on Iran could lead to a loss of 1.5 million barrels per day, while Mercuria warned that as much as 2 million bpd could be knocked out of the market. Concerns about production shortfalls are encouraging traders to place more long bets, boosting Brent prices, said Brian LaRose, a technical analyst at United-ICAP.  “This is the seventh time over the last couple of months that we have challenged the highs,” he said, referring to individual monthly contracts, rather than a continuation contract. If Brent prices climb past $82 a barrel, he said prices up to $90 would be a near-term possibility.  Some have said softening demand from trade tensions between the U.S. and China to offset loss of Iranian supply, but Tradition’s McGillian said that unless trade tensions show signs of eroding Chinese demand, oil prices will surge further.   U.S. commercial crude oil inventories C-STK-T-EIA are at their lowest since early 2015. While U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA is near a record high of 11 million bpd, subdued U.S. drilling points toward a slowdown in output.

2018-09-24,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The European Union and the United States are still in exploratory talks about how they can pursue a limited trade agreement, with no real negotiations yet started, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said on Monday. Malmstrom told reporters on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly that the two sides are looking at facilitating sales of U.S. liquefied natural gas to Europe and reducing regulatory barriers to trade. “We’re still in that exploratory phase. We haven’t started any negotiations yet. People are talking to each other and we will have a new meeting in November,” Malmstrom said. Malmstrom said she also expects to meet with U.S. Trader Representative Robert Lighthizer and Japanese Economy Minister Hiroshige Seko in New York to discuss efforts to reform the World Trade Organization. She said the three ministers will discuss possible reforms aimed at reducing industrial subsidies, where China and other countries “are massively subsidizing state-owned enterprise and thereby creating imbalances in the global market.” “We are also talking about issues related to forced technology transfers, for instance, where we think we need new rules,” she added. The United States is pursuing tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of Chinese imports based partly on its accusations that China’s policies unfairly force U.S. companies to transfer technology to their Chinese partners.

2018-09-24,"JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudan’s government forces and largest rebel group clashed in the north of the country, with each side accusing the other on Monday of instigating the fighting, which comes just two weeks after they signed a peace deal. It was unclear if there were any casualties. President Salva Kiir signed a peace agreement with rebel factions to end a civil war that has killed at least 50,000 people, displaced 2 million and limited the country’s development since it gained independence seven years ago. Lam Tungwar, state Minister of Information in Liech state, formerly part of Unity State, said fighters belonging to the main rebel SPLM-IO force loyal to former vice president Riek Machar had attacked government positions in a small village in Koch County. He said the attack occurred while the government was carrying out exercises aimed at integrating various fighters with the army in the areas under their control. “They were attacked by the forces loyal to Riek Machar,” Tungwar told Reuters. “We are still receiving details of casualties if there were any.” Machar’s SPLM-IO in turn said government troops had attacked their positions in the same region on Monday afternoon. “They made a coordinated attack on our defensive positions of Mirmir, Ngony and Koch. The architect of this attack is Gen. Peter Dor Manjur and the pro-government militias that they mobilised recently,” SPLM-IO deputy military spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel said, adding that the fighting was still going on. South Sudan plunged into warfare two years after independence from Sudan in 2011 when a political dispute between Kiir and Machar erupted into armed confrontation. A previous peace deal signed in 2015 fell apart a year later after clashes broke out between government forces and rebels. Machar and other insurgent factions signed the latest agreement with the Juba government after assurances that a power-sharing accord would be honoured. The deal, mediated by Sudan, reinstates Machar to his former role as vice-president.

2018-09-24,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s new digital fuel payment system got off to a slow start on Monday, as most drivers paid with cash and only a handful of gas stations were equipped with the system that President Nicolas Maduro says will limit fuel smuggling. The new system entails Venezuelans applying for and using a state-backed digital identification document to pay for fuel, with the government providing gas stations with wireless devices that will read the card.  Leftist Maduro has said the system will limit the cross-border trading of gas, which is so heavily subsidized that drivers often do not even bother paying for it. Last week, he said the new payment system would roll out on Monday. That followed a pilot earlier this month in border states, where fuel smugglers are the most active, though drivers at the time said the system was not functioning. Gas station employees and drivers that Reuters spoke to on Monday said the system was not fully operational. “Right now payments aren’t being made with the system, it’s only to show how it works,” said an employee of a gas station in Caracas, who asked not to be identified. “This is a test phase, it’s a month-long test.” The Information Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Maduro has said gasoline prices will rise to international levels by October, but has provided no details on what the prices would be. The issue has been politically delicate since a 1989 austerity package that included a fuel price hike triggered rioting that left thousands dead. Maduro’s previous plans to raise gasoline prices have either been abandoned or resulted in insignificant increases that were quickly overtaken by inflation.  Many Venezuelans Reuters spoke to said they were confused about what the new prices will be and called the card a mechanism to withhold benefits and services from those who oppose Maduro.  “To me this system is garbage,” said Mercedes Fernandez, 41, a systems engineer. “We don’t even know how much it’s going to cost, or how we’re going to pay.”  Fernandez shortly thereafter filled her tank and paid for the fuel with a bank note worth 0.01 bolivars, currently the smallest denomination of legal tender. The combination of fixed fuel prices and annual inflation now topping 200,000 percent has made gasoline so cheap as to be effectively free. For the amount it costs to buy one kilo (2.2 pounds) of cheese, a driver could fill their tank 20,000 times.

2018-09-24,"(Repeating Sept 23 story with no changes to text) * Shell says reducing presence in onshore Nigerian fields * But onshore production remains above 50pct of total * Most of the increase is due to new gas production * Spill volumes remain persistently high * Graphic: Shell spills tmsnrt.rs/2KzACfH * Graphic: Shell production in Nigeria tmsnrt.rs/2OB5wa0 * Graphic: Shell's onshore production tmsnrt.rs/2CLPxEU By Ron Bousso BODO, Nigeria, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell wants to reweight its footprint in Nigeria to focus on oil and gas fields far offshore, away from the theft, spills, corruption and unrest that have plagued the West African country’s onshore industry for decades. But for the company that pioneered Nigeria’s oil industry in the 1950s, the Niger Delta remains as important — and problematic — as ever. While Shell has cut onshore oil production and sold some onshore assets, it continues to invest in others. In fact, onshore production has risen in recent years as a share of Shell’s output in Nigeria, an analysis of company data over the past decade shows. Much of the increase comes from less polluting gas, used mainly in power generation, which Shell thinks will be key to the transition to lower carbon energy. Gas made up 70 percent of onshore production in 2017, up from 47 percent in 2008. The company still controls thousands of kilometres of pipelines connecting inland fields to coastal terminals through its subsidiary, Shell Petroleum Development Co of Nigeria (SPDC), however. So while SPDC has cut oil production in the Delta by 70 percent since 2011, when it first started reporting data on spills, the incidence of spills and theft from pipelines has fallen at a much lower rate and has picked up again recently, the data shows. Shell’s Nigeria Country Chair Osagie Okunbor hinted it was a sensitive balancing act. “We are too big just to see ourselves as ‘there is a problem and we have to run’. That is not what we are thinking of doing,” he told reporters on a media trip to the country in July. “But at the same time we don’t want to spread our footprint.” Two pipeline spills in 2008 in the small community of Bodo in Ogoniland are emblematic of the problems in the Delta, a vast maze of creeks and mangrove swamps criss-crossed by pipelines and blighted by poverty and oil-fueled violence. On a speedboat trip to the site of a clean-up operation launched by Shell last year, a makeshift oil refinery stood idle on a charred landing. The ground was soaked with oil, the air heavy with petrol fumes and slicks glistened in the water nearby. There were few signs of birds or fish. So far this year, 85 crude spills have been recorded, already higher than the previous two years. In 2016, militant attacks pushed the volume of spills to more than 30,000 barrels, a high since 2011. Oil theft from SPDC rose to around 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 - a loss of nearly $180 million for the year - from 6,000 bpd the year before. Despite all the problems and costs, however, Nigerian onshore operations generate billions of dollars annually. Shell does not break down profits by country, but a report on payments to governments that the company publishes annually showed it paid around $1.1 billion in royalties, taxes and fees to the Nigerian government in 2017. That means Shell earned more than $4 billion from oil and gas production in Nigeria in 2017 - around 7 percent of its total global output. A Shell spokesman declined to comment on the specifics of Reuters’ data analysis. The Nigerian Petroleum Ministry declined to comment. Shell has shown it can shut down if it is not making money. It stopped producing oil completely in Iraq last year after half a century in the country, although it retains substantial gas operations. “It’s hard to think Shell would stay put onshore and weather all the problems if the assets didn’t offer decent returns,” said Aaron Sayne, a financial crime lawyer working at the Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI). “To some extent, the onshore must still be worth the trouble.” Shell remains central to Nigeria’s economy and society. SPDC - operated by Shell with a 30 percent stake while the Nigerian National Petroleum Co has 55 percent, France’s Total has 10 percent and Italy’s Eni has 5 percent - is the country’s largest oil joint venture, employing thousands. The Anglo-Dutch giant’s operations drew unwelcome attention in the early 1990s when residents of the Delta’s Ogoni region called for fairer distribution of oil wealth and compensation for spills. The government cracked down and in 1995 executed nine protest leaders, including prominent writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, prompting Shell to end production in the area forever. It retained control of the Trans-Niger Pipeline, however, and nearly a quarter of a century later, little seems to have changed on the ground. In 2015 Shell accepted responsibility for operational faults that caused the 2008 spills that dumped tens of thousands of oil barrels into creeks around Bodo, and paid a settlement of 55 million pounds to villagers. Dozens of spills since, including one by a barge carrying stolen oil that sunk in July, are frustrating remediation efforts, clean-up officials said. “You clean it up, you walk away, somebody goes back there and does the same thing. It’s like going around in circles,” said Ogonnaya Iroakasi, Ogoni restoration project supervisor and an SPDC member. Around 80 percent of the spills are a result of sabotage, Shell data shows. Shell has taken a number of steps to improve the situation in the area, including training youth to start up businesses and funding local community patrols, campaigns to raise local awareness and even a local radio station. But critics say it is not enough. “I am not minimizing the challenge of re-pollution but Shell are not doing enough to solve it,” said Daniel Leader, the Bodo community’s lead UK lawyer. “The pipelines are not equipped with the most basic leak detection technology and Shell is simply not present on the ground in these communities.” Local residents are frustrated as the slow process stops many from fishing, one of the main sources of income. Much of the anger is focused on Shell but Eni has also struggled to cope in recent years. Since starting to report data to authorities in 2014, the Italian company has recorded more spills than Shell, according to Amnesty International. “Please, don’t give up on us ... I hope that you guys here can force Shell to do the right thing,” Michael Porobunu, chairman of Gokana council of chiefs, told the clean-up crew and reporters on his porch. SPDC has sold 10 of the 27 field licences in the Delta it held in 2010, mostly to local companies. It has applied to renew the remaining licences, which expire next year. The divestments are a reminder of another cost of doing business in Nigeria - corruption. Shell has filed a criminal complaint against a former senior employee over suspected bribes in the $390 million sale of oil mining licence 42 to local firm Neconde in 2011. Offshore operations are an attractive alternative to the Delta in many ways. The Bonga field 120 km (75 miles) off the coast is one of Shell’s prized assets since starting up in 2005. The giant tanker, with a drilling platform that pumps 225,000 barrels of oil and 210 million cubic feet of gas per day from a field one km below, won the company’s “asset of the year award” in 2016 for its safety and reliability. Many risks remain. In 2016, the Trans-Forcados pipeline was shut down for months after militants detonated a bomb at its sub-sea section. Shell and Eni face bribery allegations in a Milan court over the 2011 purchase of an offshore licence. Drilling offshore is also more expensive and technically complex. Shell and its partners will decide next year on whether to develop a new offshore field, Bonga Southwest. “Such an investment will reopen the window for the next wave of investment in deep water Nigeria,” Bayo Ojulari, managing director of Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company, said in Lagos.

2018-09-24,"(Repeating Sept 23 timeline with no changes to text) LONDON, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell pioneered Nigeria’s oil and gas industry and remains a major investor in the West African country. But over the decades it has come under fire over spills in the Delta region and struggles with oil theft, corruption and oil-fueled violence. Following are some of the highlights of Shell’s history in Nigeria: 1936 - The Royal Dutch Shell Group establishes a Nigerian venture with the precursor company of BP Plc. The first shipment of oil from Nigeria takes place in 1958. April 1973 - Nigerian government takes a stake in the venture. Over the coming years, the government increases its stake and BP exits. 1979 - The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC) is established, incorporating assets of the older Shell-BP consortium. Over time, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation comes to own 55 percent, Shell owns 30 percent, France’s Total owns 10 percent and Italy’s Eni 5 percent. Shell remains the operator. 1990 - The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), led by firebrand environmental rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa, starts campaigning for a fairer share of oil wealth for the Ogoni people living on oil fields and compensation for environmental damage. January 1993 - MOSOP organises protests of around 300,000 Ogoni people against Shell and oil pollution. Nigeria’s military government occupies the region. April 1993 - Shell forms Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company Limited (SNEPCo), which signs Production Sharing Contracts to develop offshore oil and gas interests. 1993 - Shell ceases production in Ogoniland. November 1995 - Saro-Wiwa and eight other MOSOP leaders are executed by Sani Abacha’s military government on alleged murder charges, to worldwide horror. Nigeria is suspended from the Commonwealth. Late 1990s - Over time, Shell’s focus shifts to offshore exploration, where it enjoys better margins and fewer threats of attack by militants. October 2003 - SPDC pumps more than 1 million barrels of oil per day. 2005 - Shell starts production at the giant Bonga offshore field. 2006 - Militant group MEND (Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta) emerges and begins to attack Shell facilities. Like MOSOP it seeks a great share of oil wealth for the Delta’s people and remediation for oil spills. SPDC pump stations and platforms in Niger delta are attacked and production falls. 2008 - Two large spills, a result of operational faults, hit the community of Bodo in Ogoniland in the Niger Delta. Tens of thousands of barrels of oil are spilt. January 2010 - SPDC sells some onshore fields and says it is no longer looking to Nigeria for growth. April 2011 - Shell and Italy’s Eni acquire oil production licence (OPL) 245, a large offshore field, for $1.1 billion from local company Malabu. August 2011 - A U.N. report criticises Shell and the Nigerian government for contributing to 50 years of pollution in Ogoniland which it says needs the world’s largest oil clean-up, costing an initial $1 billion and taking up to 30 years. March 2012 - A group of 11,000 Nigerians from Bodo, Ogoniland, launch a suit against Shell at the London High Court, seeking tens of millions of dollars in compensation for the 2008 oil spills. January 2013 - A Dutch court rules that Shell could be held partially responsible for pollution in the Niger Delta, saying the company should have prevented sabotage at one of its facilities. Four Nigerians and Friends of the Earth filed the suit originally in 2008 in the Netherlands. January 2015 - Shell accepts liability for the Bodo spills, agreeing to pay 55 million pounds ($83 million at the time) to Bodo villagers and to clean up their lands and waterways. May 2018 - Court case against Shell and Eni over the 2011 OPL 245 acquisition starts in Milan. Nine current and former executives and contractors, including ENI Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi, are accused by Italian prosecutors of paying bribes to secure the license.

U.S. stock futures slipped 0.2 percent, while spreadbetters pointed to a subdued start for Europe with futures for Eurostoxx 50, Germany’s Dax and London’s FTSE all opening in the red. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell almost 1 percent. Hong Kong was the worst performer with its Hang Seng index down 1.7 percent. Share markets in major Asian centres Japan, China and South Korea were closed for a holiday on Monday, while currency markets were subdued as banks in those countries were shut. Investors were squarely focused on the Sino-U.S. trade war as China added $60 billion of U.S. products to its import tariff list, retaliating against U.S. duties on $200 billion of Chinese goods that came into effect at 0401 GMT Monday. China also cancelled mid-level trade talks with the United States, as well as a proposed visit to Washington by Vice Premier Liu He which had been scheduled for this week, the Wall Street Journal reported. Soon after the duties went into effect, China accused the United States of engaging in “trade bullyism”, the official Xinhua news agency said. Xinhua cited a white paper on the trade dispute published by the State Council to say China was willing to restart negotiations with the United States in an “equal and mutually beneficial context.” “This shows China will not hold talks under tariff threats,” said Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro-strategy for Westpac. “If the United States is using threat as a tactic, it does not seem to work,” Cheung added. “Markets have low expectation that a deal can be reached  before U.S. mid-term elections.” The intensifying dispute between the world’s two biggest economies has spooked financial markets worried about the impact on global growth. The Japanese yen, which sees fund inflows during times of crisis, held above a recent two-month trough at 112.6 per dollar while the trade-sensitive Australian dollar slipped from a 3-1/2 week top to $0.7263. “Both the U.S. and China are digging in, and increasingly the subtext seems to be as much about advancing a trade ideology as it is about rescinding trade tariffs,” said John Bilton, head of global multi-asset strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management. “As a result, both the extent and depth of any economic impact are being recalibrated,” Bilton said. “So while we continue to be constructive on the global economy over the coming quarters, it is hard to see the current surge in U.S. activity morphing into another period of coordinated global growth.” Britain’s negotiation with European Union will be another key issue for investors, with risks of a ‘no deal’ or ‘hard Brexit’ shooting up again. On Friday, British Prime Minister Theresa May said talks with the European Union had hit an impasse after the bloc’s leaders rejected her “Chequers” plan without fully explaining why. Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Sunday he would back a second Brexit referendum if his Labour Party votes to pursue the move, heaping more pressure on May, amid speculation that she could opt to call a snap general elections. The pound last at $1.3072, slightly above Friday’s $1.3053 which was the lowest since mid-September. The euro eased from a three-month peak on Monday to last trade at $1.1733. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was last at 94.315 to edge above its weakest point since early July touched on Friday. Late last week, the dollar was hammered as investors ramped up bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve will be near the end of its rate-hike cycle after an expected increase this week. Oil prices gained as OPEC’s leader Saudi Arabia and its biggest oil-producer ally outside the group Russia effectively rebuffed U.S. President Donald Trump’s calls for action to lower prices. Brent crude futures gained $1.60 to a four-month peak of $80.3 a barrel while U.S. crude futures shot up $1.3 to $72.10, a level not seen since early July.

2018-09-24,"LONDON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Thousands of people packed the streets of the southwestern Iranian city of Ahvaz on Monday to mourn the victims of an attack on a military parade that killed 25 people, including 12 members of the elite Revolutionary Guards. Saturday’s assault, one of the worst against the most powerful military force of the Islamic Republic, struck a blow at its security establishment at a time when the United States and its Gulf allies are working to isolate Tehran. Iran has declared Monday a national day of mourning. Public offices, banks, schools and universities will be closed in Khuzestan province. Four assailants fired on a viewing stand in Ahvaz where Iranian officials had gathered to watch an annual event marking the start of the Islamic Republic’s 1980-88 war with Iraq. Islamic State’s Amaq agency posted a video of three men in a vehicle who it said were on their way to carry out the attack. A man wearing a baseball cap emblazoned with what appears to be a Revolutionary Guard logo discussed the impending attack in Farsi in the video. “We are Muslims, they are kafirs (non-believers),” the man says. He adds: “We will destroy them with a strong and guerrilla-style attack, inshallah (God willing).” Ahvaz National Resistance, an Iranian ethnic Arab opposition movement which seeks a separate state in oil-rich Khuzestan province, also claimed responsibility for the attack. Senior commanders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) have said the Ahvaz attack was carried out by militants trained by Gulf states and Israel, and backed by America. But it is unlikely the IRGC will strike any of these foes directly. The Guards could put on a show of strength by firing missiles at opposition groups operating in Iraq or Syria that may be linked to the militants who staged the attack. They are also likely to enforce a tight security policy in Khuzestan province, arresting any perceived domestic opponents including civil rights activists.

Speaking at the annual Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC) in Singapore on Monday, Unipec President Chen Bo said improved energy efficiency and technological changes, including the rise of renewables, meant global oil demand growth would slow in coming years and peak at 104.4 million bpd in 2035. Despite trade disputes between China and the United States, he said, U.S. crude supply was an important new source for Chinese refiners as it allows diversification away from Middle East and African crudes, on which China has relied heavily. Trade war tensions between the United States and China will last just “for the time being, and in the future we’ll be active in this area,” he said. Chen Bo also said China would reduce Iranian oil imports because of looming U.S. sanctions against the Middle East country due to start in November, although he added that there had not yet been a decision on how big these cuts would be. Given the current supply and demand dynamic in global markets, he said, crude oil prices between at $60 and $80 per barrel were normal.

2018-09-24,"(Reuters) - Rain-swollen rivers in North and South Carolina kept rising on Sunday and were forecast to remain at flood level for days, the National Weather Service said more than a week after the landfall of Hurricane Florence, already blamed for at least 40 deaths. As many as 8,000 people in and around Georgetown, South Carolina, have been “strongly urged” to evacuate flood-prone areas along the Waccamaw and Pee Dee rivers early this week, Georgetown County spokeswoman Jackie Broach-Akers told Reuters. Emergency management officials began sending pre-recorded telephone messages to residents in harm’s way over the weekend, and will probably start going door-to-door in the next few days, she said. Authorities expect 5 to 10 feet (1.5 m to 3 m) of flooding in neighbourhoods encompassing some 3,500 homes close to where the two rain-gorged rivers flow into Winyah Bay on the way to the Atlantic, Broach-Akers said. The flood zone includes Georgetown, at the rivers’  confluence, and the coastal resort community of Pawleys Island. The county plans to open emergency shelters at 7 a.m. on Monday, and hotels outside the flood zone in nearby Myrtle Beach are offering discounts for evacuees. Public schools will be closed until further notice, Broach-Akers said. State transportation crews were working to erect temporary dams on either side of U.S. Highway 17, the main coastal route through the area, and National Guard engineers were installing a floating bridge at Georgetown in case the highway is washed out at the river. About 100 miles (160 km) up the coast, a commercial section of downtown Wilmington, North Carolina, by the Cape Fear River was under a foot of water, with flooding expected to rise by a further 2 feet (0.61 m) with high tide on Sunday evening, city spokesman Dylan Lee said. Flooding in Wilmington was expected to peak on Monday along the city’s Water Street riverfront, where many businesses had stacked sandbags in advance, Lee said. But the city said its offices would reopen on Monday after having been closed for a week. Nine days after Florence came ashore, the National Weather Service said flooding would likely persist in coastal parts of the Carolinas for days as the high-water crest of numerous rivers keeps moving downstream toward the ocean. “This isn’t over,” said Bob Oravec, a meteorologist with the NWS’ Weather Prediction Center. “All that water is going to take a good while to recede,” he said. “Damage can still be done. It’ll be a slow drop.” The storm dumped 30 to 40 inches (75 to 100 cm) of rain on the Wilmington area alone after making landfall nearby on Sept. 14.  Floodwaters have begun to recede farther inland. That left hundreds of dead fish stranded on a highway near Wallace, about 35 miles (56 km) from the nearest beach, according to the Penderlea Fire Department, which posted video of firefighters hosing the fish off Interstate 40. “Well, we can add ‘washing fish off of the interstate’ to the long list of interesting things firefighters get to experience!” the department said on Facebook. Remnants of the once-mighty storm brought heavy rains across a wide swath of the country, prompting flood watches and warnings from Texas to Virginia and Maryland, at least through Monday, the weather service said. About 5,000 people across North Carolina have been rescued by boat or helicopter since the storm made landfall, twice as many as in Hurricane Matthew two years ago, according to state officials. Thousands of people remained in shelters.

2018-09-24,"(Repeats with no changes) * Trump's tweets on oil prices: tmsnrt.rs/2MUmIWZ By John Kemp LONDON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - The United States has sent mixed messages to OPEC and its allies over the last week about whether they need to do more to raise oil production and hold down prices. “The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now” President Donald Trump demanded on Twitter on Sept. 20. “We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices,” he complained. “We will remember,” the president added, implying that U.S. security support might be reassessed if OPEC members fail to cut crude prices. But just seven days earlier, the president’s own energy secretary had told reporters that Saudi Arabia, OPEC and Russia “are to be admired and appreciated” for raising their production to avoid a spike in oil prices. The mixed messages illustrate the narrow and difficult path the administration is trying to take imposing tough sanctions on Iran’s oil exports without sending prices sharply higher. The United States is coordinating policy on sanctions and production closely with both Saudi Arabia and Russia; the U.S. energy secretary has met both his Saudi and Russian counterparts in the last fortnight. At the same time, the White House is anxious to avoid being blamed by U.S. motorists for any further escalation in the cost of oil and gasoline, especially in the run-up to a tough congressional election on Nov. 6, but perhaps afterwards too. In effect, there are two separate policies, or at least two different messages, one run by the president, and the other by his administration. It is not unusual for governments to try to run multiple policies and messages, addressed to different audiences and intended to achieve different objectives, though it risks creating confusion and disappointment. The president has criticised OPEC for rising oil prices four times on Twitter this year as well as in an interview with Fox News (tmsnrt.rs/2MUmIWZ). The president’s tweets have generally been prompted when Brent crude prices have recently risen sharply and are in the $75-80 range. From the president’s behaviour, it is possible to infer that he doesn’t want prices to rise above $80 per barrel and would prefer them closer to $70 or even below. The president’s tweets are creating an implicit price target, even if officials have been careful not to specify an explicit one. So far, the president has been careful to blame “OPEC” and unspecified countries in the “Middle East” for rising oil prices, eschewing identifying individual countries by name. As a practical matter, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are the only OPEC members that have significant volumes of spare capacity and could raise output. But all three are close allies of the United States, and Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates have been at the forefront pushing for tough sanctions on fellow OPEC member Iran. The president has so far been careful to avoid embarrassing them by identifying them individually, though his tweets have left no ambiguity about their target. For the time being, the president may be content to complain on Twitter but do little else, in order to avoid being blamed for the rise in oil prices that is a byproduct of his sanctions policy. However, if oil prices continue rising and hit $81-82 or even $85, the president’s tweets may become more pointed and the White House could take tougher action to raise the political pressure on Riyadh. Oil prices are now hovering uncertainly amid dwindling exports from Iran, poor production from other OPEC members and Brazil, decelerating output growth in the United States, and an uncertain consumption outlook. Into that already complicated mix, the president of the United States is now trying to enforce a political price target of $80 or less.

Brent crude futures were at $79.74 per barrel at 0036 GMT, up by 94 cents, or 1.2 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose by 74 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $71.52 a barrel. The market was “increasingly concerned about dwindling (U.S.) inventories,” ANZ bank said on Monday. U.S. commercial crude oil inventories C-STK-T-EIA are at their lowest level since early 2015. And while output C-OUT-T-EIA remains around the record of 11 million barrels per day (bpd), recent subdued U.S. drilling activity points towards a slowdown. The tightening U.S. market came ahead of sanctions that Washington plans to implement against Iran’s petroleum exports from early November, which many analysts expect to result in a drop of more than 1 million bpd of crude exports. The Middle East dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which Iran is a member, as well as top producer Russia are discussing raising output by 500,000 bpd to counter falling supply from Iran, although the discussions are not finalised.

The Japanese yen, which sees fund inflows during times of crisis, ticked up to 112.5 per dollar while the trade-sensitive Australian dollar slipped from a 3-1/2 week top to $0.7274. “The trouble is that further escalation is still on the cards as both sides are still well apart on the key issues,” said AMP Chief Economist Shane Oliver. “Trump remains defiant saying ‘it’s time to take a stand on China’ and his threat to increase tariffs on all imports from China remains,” Oliver added. He remained optimistic about Chinese growth as authorities in Beijing devise policy stimulus to offset the economic impact of the tariffs. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said over the weekend China will cut import and export costs for foreign firms as it looks to promote an image of being open for business. “Our view remains that a negotiated solution is likely but its unlikely to come until later this year or early next,” Oliver added. On Friday, Wall Street closed mixed with the Dow adding 0.32 percent, he S&P 500 mostly unchanged and the Nasdaq easing 0.51 percent. Britain’s exit from the European Union will be another key issue for investors, with risks of a ‘no deal’ or ‘hard Brexit’ shooting up again. On Friday, British Prime Minister Theresa May said talks with European Union had hit an impasse after the bloc’s leaders rejected her “Chequers” plan without fully explaining why. The pound fell as much as 1.4 percent on Friday, its biggest one-day percentage loss since June 2017. It was last at $1.3076 from Friday’s $1.3053, the lowest since mid-September. The euro eased from a three-month peak on Monday to last trade at $1.1747. The dollar’s index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was last at 94.22 to hover near its weakest point since early July. The dollar was hammered late last week as investors ramped up bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve will be near the end of its rate-rising cycle after an expected increase this week. The Fed will end its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. Oil prices gained as OPEC’s leader Saudi Arabia and its biggest oil-producer ally outside the group Russia effectively rebuffed U.S. President Donald Trump’s calls for action to lower prices.

About 50 percent of the 2.5 million bpd of oil products it trades currently are hedged, he said. The company is also looking at building its capacity in trading liquefied natural gas (LNG), using its Singapore office as a trading hub, Buainain said. ATC plans to set up its European office in either Geneva or London and also aims to have an office in Fujairah to manage oil storage, he said. In Singapore, Buainain said he expects the company’s office to grow to 30 to 40 people within the next two years. ATC also expected to benefit from a switch by ships to cleaner fuels in 2020 as mandated by the International Maritime Organization. “The second-hand effect of the IMO is the oversupply of high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) which in our case is a positive because we are net short on fuel oil and that will help us in meeting our requirements (for HSFO) in power generation,” Buainain said. Buainain has headed the trading arm of Saudi Aramco since 2016. ATC was set up in 2012 to market refined products, base oils and bulk petrochemicals. It started trading non-Saudi crude oil and refined products from its overseas refineries in the past years as the world’s largest oil exporter seeks to optimise profits.

2018-09-24,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - World oil demand will peak at 104.4 million barrels per day (bpd) in the mid-2030s, up from just below 100 million bpd currently, as new technologies gradually eat into oil use, China’s Unipec said on Monday. Improved energy efficiency and technological changes, including the rise of renewables, meant global oil demand growth would slow in coming years before peaking in 2035, Unipec President Chen Bo told the annual Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC). This in turn will slow growth in global oil refining capacity, which is set to hit 5.6 billion tonnes per year in 2035, he said. “We believe 2018-2035 will be the last cycle of global refining capacity expansion. After 2035, it is difficult to see large-scale refining projects in construction, except for some small upgrade projects and petrochemical projects,” said Chen. Unipec is the trading arm of Asia’s largest refiner Sinopec (600028.SS). The switch to cleaner fuels will also boost global demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), particularly in the Asia Pacific, after 2025, he added. An escalating trade war between China, the largest energy importer, and the United States has dampened the Asian nation’s demand for U.S. crude oil and LNG. The United States exported 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil to China in the first half of 2018, and 56 cargoes of LNG through July, or roughly 10 percent of its total LNG exports, according to official data. Despite the trade dispute, Chen said U.S. crude supply was an important new source for Chinese refiners as it allowed diversification from Middle East and African crudes. Trade war tensions between the two countries would last “for the time being, and in the future we’ll be active in this area,” he added. Beijing has excluded U.S. crude imports from its tariffs list so far, but most Chinese buyers are staying away from U.S. oil as the trade war shows no signs of cooling.  Unipec resumed loading U.S. crude in September after a two-month hiatus.  China is also under pressure from the United States to reduce its Iranian oil imports as Washington aims to cut exports from OPEC’s third-largest exporter to zero to force Tehran to negotiate a nuclear treaty. Buyers in Europe, Japan, South Korea and India have either stopped or are reducing Iranian oil imports sharply ahead of the introduction of sanctions in November.  “I expect we’ll cut a little but the volume has not been finalised,” Chen said, without giving a timeframe for the cuts. He added that Unipec has resumed normal loadings of Saudi oil after it cut imports in May-July. Given the current supply and demand dynamic in global markets, Chen said, crude oil prices between at $60 and $80 per barrel were normal.

2018-09-24,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices could rise towards $100 per barrel towards the end of the year or by early 2019 as sanctions against Iran bite, commodity merchants Trafigura and Mercuria said on Monday at the Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC) in Singapore.  Almost 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude could be taken out of the market as a result of the U.S. sanctions against Iran by the end of the fourth quarter this year, said Daniel Jaeggi, president of commodity merchant Mercuria Energy Trading, making a crude price spike to $100 a barrel possible.  “We’re on the verge of some significant volatility in Q4 2018 because depending on the severity and duration of the Iranian sanctions, the market simply does not have an adequade supply response for a 2 million barrel a day disappearance of oil from the markets,” Jaeggi said.  Washington has already implemented financial sanctions against Iran and it plans to target the country’s oil exports from November 4, putting pressure on other countries to also cut Iranian crude imports.  Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at fellow merchant Trafigura said crude oil prices could rise to $90 per barrel by Christmas and to $100 by the New Year as markets tighten.  Oil prices LCOc1 have been rising since early 2017, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) together with other suppliers including Russia started withholding output to lift crude values. [O/R]  Unplanned disruptions from Venezuela to Libya and Nigeria have further tightened the market just as global demand approaches 100 million bpd for the first time.  The threats of disruption as well as the early supply cuts have helped to lift Brent crude futures to nearly $80 a barrel this month, a level not seen since 2014.  With U.S. sanctions against Iran, the third-largest producer in OPEC, looming, U.S. investment bank J.P. Morgan said in its latest market outlook that “a spike to $90 per barrel is likely” for oil prices in the coming months.

2018-09-24,"* Iranian oil exports could be cut by up to 1.5 million bpd * Exports of Iranian oil unlikely to fall to zero * Production decline Venezuela, firm demand to help boost prices By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Iran will export significantly less oil than was initially expected when the United States first announced it would reimpose sanctions on Tehran, and that should boost prices, a senior executive at commodities trader Trafigura said on Monday. “I think when the sanctions were first announced a number of months ago, people were estimating the cut may be 300,000 to 700,000 (barrels-per-day),” Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at Trafigura, told reporters. “I think the consensus has moved to it’s going to be well beyond 1 million bpd that’s cut, and maybe 1.5 million bpd.” Buyers across Asia have come under U.S. pressure to reduce their Iranian oil imports as Washington aims to cut exports from OPEC’s third-largest exporter to zero to force Tehran to renegotiate a nuclear treaty. Still, Luckock says Chinese companies will likely continue to import Iranian oil, while other traditional customers may cut volumes but not reduce imports to zero. “Export (of Iranian oil) is not going to be zero but it is going to be significantly less than it was. And probably lower than most people expected when sanctions were announced, and hence the higher (oil) prices,” he said on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC) in Singapore. Iraqi and Mexican oil have been favoured by buyers as alternatives to Iranian crude, he said. Also, to counter falling supply from Iran, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers are considering raising output by 500,000 bpd. Luckock said earlier during the conference that he expects oil prices could rise to $90 per barrel by Christmas and $100 per barrel by the New Year, from nearly $80 a barrel now for Brent crude due to robust global oil demand. Production decline from Venezuela and firm global oil demand are also likely to boost oil prices, said Luckock, who was promoted in July from his previous role as co-head of risk. New refining capacity being added in Asia will also likely provide incremental demand for crude oil, he said. “These are exciting times with a bunch of new refineries coming online and a bunch of dislocation in the crude oil market around the world, so we really should have incremental volatility going forward,” he said. Luckock also said that while this year has been challenging for the industry, next year is looking more bullish.

Brent crude hit its highest since May at $80.47 per barrel, up $1.63 or more than 2 percent, before easing back slightly to around $80.40 by 0730 GMT. U.S. light crude was $1.18 higher at $71.96.

Commodity traders Trafigura and Mercuria said on Monday that Brent could rise to $90 per barrel by Christmas and pass $100 in early 2019, as markets tighten once U.S. sanctions against Iran are fully implemented from November. J.P. Morgan says U.S. sanctions on Iran could lead to a loss of 1.5 million bpd, while Mercuria warned that as much as 2 million bpd could be knocked out of the market.

A source familiar with OPEC discussions told Reuters on Friday that OPEC and other producers have been discussing the possibility of raising output by 500,000 bpd. “We expect that those OPEC countries with available spare capacity, led by Saudi Arabia, will increase output but not completely offset the drop in Iranian barrels,” said Edward Bell, commodity analyst at Emirates NBD bank.

2018-09-24,"(Adds detail on capex, reactor availability) PARIS, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Engie said its 2018 core earnings will be slightly below the utility’s target due to outages at its Belgian nuclear plants, but the Belgian nuclear availability rate should go back to at least 74 percent by next year. On Friday, the French gas and power group warned that the Belgian outages would push its 2018 net recurring income to the low end of its 2.45 billion-2.65 billion euros ($2.9 billion-$3.1 billion) forecast range but did not mention core earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA). “We expect Ebitda ... to be slightly below the indication that we had given at the beginning of the year,” Engie Chief Financial Officer Judith Hartmann said on a call with analysts. In February, Engie had said it aimed for core earnings of 9.3 to 9.7 billion euros. Hartmann said the impact of the Belgian outages on capital expenditure would be limited as the repair work on the reactor’s degraded concrete was not excessively costly. “The capex impact for the outages is quite limited ... in the dozens of millions, but not anything very significant at the scale of the company,” she said. “Those are big works but they are not very sophisticated technically,” she added. Hartmann said the Belgian reactor’s availability, which will come in at just 52 percent this year, should go back to at least 74 percent next year. Asked whether the Belgian fleet could go back to availability rates of 90 percent in coming years, she said the company would be working on that. “It is 75-80 percent in a normal year and has been higher than that in most of the past years except 2015. In the past it was around 90 percent, so over time it should normalise,” she said. Engie’s Belgian unit Electrabel operates seven nuclear reactors in Belgium, four at Doel and three at Tihange, which produce about half the country’s electricity when they are fully operational. Only two Belgian reactors are in operation at the moment, namely the Doel 3 and Tihange 1 reactors. Three have been halted for extended maintenance since the spring, while two have been out since August. They are expected to come back online between December 15 and the end of May 2019.

2018-09-24,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Somebody is going to be wrong on the outlook for the crude oil price, as the market cannot be well-supplied and increasingly tight at the same time. The message from Saudi Arabia, the biggest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and its ally Russia is that there is no need for extra crude in the market. However, the word from traders and refiners at the industry’s annual gathering in Singapore this week is that the market starting to look short of necessary barrels, and prices are likely to head higher. Certainly, the recent rise in front-month prices for oil benchmarks such as Brent seem to support the view that the market is tightening. Brent traded as high as $80.43 a barrel in Asia on Monday, within spitting distance of the intraday peak for the year on May 17, and if it closes above $80 it will the first time this has happened since November 2014. But the rise in prices doesn’t seem to be an issue for Saudi Arabia, with Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih saying after a meeting of OPEC and its allies in Algiers at the weekend that there was no plan to boost output, even though they could if needed. “The markets are adequately supplied. I don’t know of any refiner in the world who is looking for oil and is not able to get it,” Falih told reporters after the meeting. While refiners may be able to get crude oil, they are having to pay more for it, and deal with mounting disruptions to normal supply chains. The U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran is already forcing refiners to look elsewhere for supplies of the heavy, sour crudes supplied by the Islamic Republic. The situation may worsen in the months following November, when the administration of President Donald Trump imposes sanctions on all Iranian exports. While Iran is unlikely to see a drop to zero exports, initial assessments by several analysts that about 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian oil would be lost appear way too optimistic now. It’s possible that Iranian exports may drop by more than 1 million (bpd), and possibly even as high as 2 million bpd, as major customers with the possible exception of China switch to alternatives. Add to this the loss of Venezuelan oil because of mounting economic and political problems, and ongoing conflict-related disruptions in Libya, and suddenly the market doesn’t look that well-supplied any more. A further complicating factor is the U.S. trade dispute with China, which is likely to result in Chinese refiners buying less crude from the United States, disrupting what had become a significant trade flow. While it’s possible that refiners around the world will be able to juggle their supplies to work around the politically-created disruptions, this is likely to come at a cost. As always, quantifying that cost is difficult, but the co-head of oil trading at Trafigura, Ben Luckock, on Monday told the Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference, hosted by S&P Global Platts, that a price of $90 a barrel by Christmas and $100 by New Year was possible. Crude oil price curves are currently in backwardation, with front-month contracts more expensive that later-dated futures. Backwardation is normally a sign of a tight market, as traders and consumers are prepared to pay more in order to assure supplies in the near term. But if prices really are expected to rise sharply in the coming months on the back of the U.S. sanctions against Iran, it may make sense to buy longer-dated oil at the current prices. Looking at prices that more closely track Iranian crude, such as Oman futures on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange and physical Dubai swaps, and some interesting trends emerge. The Oman forward curve has seen backwardation steepen in the past month, with the front-month contract now at a premium of $2.95 to the six-month future, up from $1.88 a month ago. However, comparing the paper Oman contract to physical Dubai shows that the forward curve for the physical market is not as steeply backwardated. Currently, Dubai swaps for November are at $75.95 a barrel, a premium of $2.07 to the April contract. What may be happening is that physical oil consumers, such as refiners, are locking in supplies further along the curve in anticipation of price rises, while the front-end of the paper markets are being driven higher by investor flows seeking to take advantage of increasing media coverage of a tighter market. But once the U.S. sanctions on Iran take full effect, it will become clearer whether the Saudis are correct that the market is well-supplied, or whether the traders have picked a winner in tipping higher prices.

2018-09-24,"* Emergency messages being sent to residents in harm’s way * Potential flood zone encompasses some 3,500 homes * Dead fish left on highway as waters recede By Harriet McLeod and Gene Cherry Sept 24 (Reuters) - As many as 8,000 people in and around the city of Georgetown, South Carolina, have been urged to evacuate ahead severe flooding expected this week from two rain-gorged rivers in what may be the final destructive chapter of Hurricane Florence. Floodwaters of 5 to 10 feet (1.5 to 3 m) are expected to inundate Georgetown and surrounding communities by late this week as the Pee Dee and Waccamaw rivers overurn their banks along the low-lying tidal flats where they converge at Winyah Bay, which flows into the Atlantic. Emergency management officials began sending pre-recorded telephone messages to residents in harm’s way over the weekend, and will probably start going door-to-door in the next few days, Georgetown County spokeswoman Jackie Broach-Akers said. The potential flood zone encompasses some 3,500 homes in Georgetown, which lies at the confluence of the two rivers at the top of the bay, and the coastal resort community of Pawleys Island, she told Reuters. She said the estimated 6,000 to 8,000 people who live in that area are being “strongly urged”, to leave on their own, although no mandatory evacuation has been ordered. The county plans to open emergency shelters at 7 a.m. on Monday, and hotels outside the flood zone in nearby Myrtle Beach are offering discounts for evacuees. Public schools will be closed until further notice, Broach-Akers said. State transportation crews were working to erect temporary dams on either side of U.S. Highway 17, the main coastal route through the area, and National Guard engineers were installing a floating bridge at Georgetown in case the highway is washed out at the river. “The water is still rising there,” said Bob Oravec, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center. “It’s a matter of time before it subsides,” he said early on Monday. About 100 miles (160 km) up the coast, a commercial section of downtown Wilmington, North Carolina, by the Cape Fear River was under a foot of water, with flooding expected to rise by a further 2 feet with high tide on Sunday evening, city spokesman Dylan Lee said. Flooding in Wilmington was expected to peak on Monday along the city’s Water Street riverfront, where many businesses had stacked sandbags in advance, Lee said. But the city said its offices would reopen on Monday after having been closed for a week. Nine days after Florence came ashore, the National Weather Service said flooding would likely persist in coastal parts of the Carolinas for days as the high-water crest of numerous rivers keeps moving downstream toward the ocean. “This isn’t over,” said Oravec. “All that water is going to take a good while to recede,” he said. “Damage can still be done. It’ll be a slow drop.” The storm dumped 30 to 40 inches (75 to 100 cm) of rain on the Wilmington area alone after making landfall nearby on Sept. 14. Floodwaters have begun to recede farther inland. That left hundreds of dead fish stranded on a highway near Wallace, about 35 miles from the nearest beach, according to the Penderlea Fire Department, which posted video of firefighters hosing the fish off Interstate 40. “Well, we can add ‘washing fish off of the interstate’ to the long list of interesting things firefighters get to experience!” the department said on Facebook. Remnants of the once-mighty storm brought heavy rains across a swath of the country, prompting flood watches and warnings from Texas to Virginia and Maryland, at least through Monday, the weather service said. About 5,000 people across North Carolina have been rescued by boat or helicopter since the storm made landfall, twice as many as in Hurricane Matthew two years ago, according to state officials. Thousands of people remained in shelters.

But for the company that pioneered Nigeria’s oil industry in the 1950s, the Niger Delta remains as important — and problematic — as ever. While Shell has cut onshore oil production and sold some onshore assets, it continues to invest in others. In fact, onshore production has risen in recent years as a share of Shell’s output in Nigeria, an analysis of company data over the past decade shows. Much of the increase comes from less polluting gas, used mainly in power generation, which Shell thinks will be key to the transition to lower carbon energy. Gas made up 70 percent of onshore production in 2017, up from 47 percent in 2008. The company still controls thousands of kilometres of pipelines connecting inland fields to coastal terminals through its subsidiary, Shell Petroleum Development Co of Nigeria (SPDC), however. So while SPDC has cut oil production in the Delta by 70 percent since 2011, when it first started reporting data on spills, the incidence of spills and theft from pipelines has fallen at a much lower rate and has picked up again recently, the data shows. Shell’s Nigeria Country Chair Osagie Okunbor hinted it was a sensitive balancing act. “We are too big just to see ourselves as ‘there is a problem and we have to run’. That is not what we are thinking of doing,” he told reporters on a media trip to the country in July. “But at the same time we don’t want to spread our footprint.” Two pipeline spills in 2008 in the small community of Bodo in Ogoniland are emblematic of the problems in the Delta, a vast maze of creeks and mangrove swamps criss-crossed by pipelines and blighted by poverty and oil-fueled violence. On a speedboat trip to the site of a clean-up operation launched by Shell last year, a makeshift oil refinery stood idle on a charred landing. The ground was soaked with oil, the air heavy with petrol fumes and slicks glistened in the water nearby. There were few signs of birds or fish. So far this year, 85 crude spills have been recorded, already higher than the previous two years. In 2016, militant attacks pushed the volume of spills to more than 30,000 barrels, a high since 2011. Oil theft from SPDC rose to around 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 - a loss of nearly $180 million for the year - from 6,000 bpd the year before. Despite all the problems and costs, however, Nigerian onshore operations generate billions of dollars annually. Shell does not break down profits by country, but a report on payments to governments that the company publishes annually showed it paid around $1.1 billion in royalties, taxes and fees to the Nigerian government in 2017. That means Shell earned more than $4 billion from oil and gas production in Nigeria in 2017 - around 7 percent of its total global output. A Shell spokesman declined to comment on the specifics of Reuters’ data analysis. The Nigerian Petroleum Ministry declined to comment. Shell has shown it can shut down if it is not making money. It stopped producing oil completely in Iraq last year after half a century in the country, although it retains substantial gas operations. “It’s hard to think Shell would stay put onshore and weather all the problems if the assets didn’t offer decent returns,” said Aaron Sayne, a financial crime lawyer working at the Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI). “To some extent, the onshore must still be worth the trouble.” Shell remains central to Nigeria’s economy and society. SPDC - operated by Shell with a 30 percent stake while the Nigerian National Petroleum Co has 55 percent, France’s Total has 10 percent and Italy’s Eni has 5 percent - is the country’s largest oil joint venture, employing thousands. The Anglo-Dutch giant’s operations drew unwelcome attention in the early 1990s when residents of the Delta’s Ogoni region called for fairer distribution of oil wealth and compensation for spills. The government cracked down and in 1995 executed nine protest leaders, including prominent writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, prompting Shell to end production in the area forever. It retained control of the Trans-Niger Pipeline, however, and nearly a quarter of a century later, little seems to have changed on the ground. In 2015 Shell accepted responsibility for operational faults that caused the 2008 spills that dumped tens of thousands of oil barrels into creeks around Bodo, and paid a settlement of 55 million pounds to villagers. Dozens of spills since, including one by a barge carrying stolen oil that sunk in July, are frustrating remediation efforts, clean-up officials said. “You clean it up, you walk away, somebody goes back there and does the same thing. It’s like going around in circles,” said Ogonnaya Iroakasi, Ogoni restoration project supervisor and an SPDC member. Around 80 percent of the spills are a result of sabotage, Shell data shows. Shell has taken a number of steps to improve the situation in the area, including training youth to start up businesses and funding local community patrols, campaigns to raise local awareness and even a local radio station. But critics say it is not enough. “I am not minimizing the challenge of re-pollution but Shell are not doing enough to solve it,” said Daniel Leader, the Bodo community’s lead UK lawyer. “The pipelines are not equipped with the most basic leak detection technology and Shell is simply not present on the ground in these communities.” Local residents are frustrated as the slow process stops many from fishing, one of the main sources of income. Much of the anger is focused on Shell but Eni has also struggled to cope in recent years. Since starting to report data to authorities in 2014, the Italian company has recorded more spills than Shell, according to Amnesty International. “Please, don’t give up on us ... I hope that you guys here can force Shell to do the right thing,” Michael Porobunu, chairman of Gokana council of chiefs, told the clean-up crew and reporters on his porch. SPDC has sold 10 of the 27 field licences in the Delta it held in 2010, mostly to local companies. It has applied to renew the remaining licences, which expire next year. The divestments are a reminder of another cost of doing business in Nigeria - corruption. Shell has filed a criminal complaint against a former senior employee over suspected bribes in the $390 million sale of oil mining licence 42 to local firm Neconde in 2011. Offshore operations are an attractive alternative to the Delta in many ways. The Bonga field 120 km (75 miles) off the coast is one of Shell’s prized assets since starting up in 2005. The giant tanker, with a drilling platform that pumps 225,000 barrels of oil and 210 million cubic feet of gas per day from a field one km below, won the company’s “asset of the year award” in 2016 for its safety and reliability. Many risks remain. In 2016, the Trans-Forcados pipeline was shut down for months after militants detonated a bomb at its sub-sea section. Shell and Eni face bribery allegations in a Milan court over the 2011 purchase of an offshore licence. Drilling offshore is also more expensive and technically complex. Shell and its partners will decide next year on whether to develop a new offshore field, Bonga Southwest. “Such an investment will reopen the window for the next wave of investment in deep water Nigeria,” Bayo Ojulari, managing director of Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company, said in Lagos.

2018-09-24,"(Repeating Sept 23 timeline with no changes to text) LONDON, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell pioneered Nigeria’s oil and gas industry and remains a major investor in the West African country. But over the decades it has come under fire over spills in the Delta region and struggles with oil theft, corruption and oil-fueled violence. Following are some of the highlights of Shell’s history in Nigeria: 1936 - The Royal Dutch Shell Group establishes a Nigerian venture with the precursor company of BP Plc. The first shipment of oil from Nigeria takes place in 1958. April 1973 - Nigerian government takes a stake in the venture. Over the coming years, the government increases its stake and BP exits. 1979 - The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC) is established, incorporating assets of the older Shell-BP consortium. Over time, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation comes to own 55 percent, Shell owns 30 percent, France’s Total owns 10 percent and Italy’s Eni 5 percent. Shell remains the operator. 1990 - The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), led by firebrand environmental rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa, starts campaigning for a fairer share of oil wealth for the Ogoni people living on oil fields and compensation for environmental damage. January 1993 - MOSOP organises protests of around 300,000 Ogoni people against Shell and oil pollution. Nigeria’s military government occupies the region. April 1993 - Shell forms Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company Limited (SNEPCo), which signs Production Sharing Contracts to develop offshore oil and gas interests. 1993 - Shell ceases production in Ogoniland. November 1995 - Saro-Wiwa and eight other MOSOP leaders are executed by Sani Abacha’s military government on alleged murder charges, to worldwide horror. Nigeria is suspended from the Commonwealth. Late 1990s - Over time, Shell’s focus shifts to offshore exploration, where it enjoys better margins and fewer threats of attack by militants. October 2003 - SPDC pumps more than 1 million barrels of oil per day. 2005 - Shell starts production at the giant Bonga offshore field. 2006 - Militant group MEND (Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta) emerges and begins to attack Shell facilities. Like MOSOP it seeks a great share of oil wealth for the Delta’s people and remediation for oil spills. SPDC pump stations and platforms in Niger delta are attacked and production falls. 2008 - Two large spills, a result of operational faults, hit the community of Bodo in Ogoniland in the Niger Delta. Tens of thousands of barrels of oil are spilt. January 2010 - SPDC sells some onshore fields and says it is no longer looking to Nigeria for growth. April 2011 - Shell and Italy’s Eni acquire oil production licence (OPL) 245, a large offshore field, for $1.1 billion from local company Malabu. August 2011 - A U.N. report criticises Shell and the Nigerian government for contributing to 50 years of pollution in Ogoniland which it says needs the world’s largest oil clean-up, costing an initial $1 billion and taking up to 30 years. March 2012 - A group of 11,000 Nigerians from Bodo, Ogoniland, launch a suit against Shell at the London High Court, seeking tens of millions of dollars in compensation for the 2008 oil spills. January 2013 - A Dutch court rules that Shell could be held partially responsible for pollution in the Niger Delta, saying the company should have prevented sabotage at one of its facilities. Four Nigerians and Friends of the Earth filed the suit originally in 2008 in the Netherlands. January 2015 - Shell accepts liability for the Bodo spills, agreeing to pay 55 million pounds ($83 million at the time) to Bodo villagers and to clean up their lands and waterways. May 2018 - Court case against Shell and Eni over the 2011 OPL 245 acquisition starts in Milan. Nine current and former executives and contractors, including ENI Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi, are accused by Italian prosecutors of paying bribes to secure the license.

U.S. stock futures slipped 0.2 percent, while spreadbetters pointed to a subdued start for Europe with futures for Eurostoxx 50, Germany’s Dax and London’s FTSE all opening in the red. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell almost 1 percent. Hong Kong was the worst performer with its Hang Seng index down 1.7 percent. Share markets in major Asian centres Japan, China and South Korea were closed for a holiday on Monday, while currency markets were subdued as banks in those countries were shut. Investors were squarely focused on the Sino-U.S. trade war as China added $60 billion of U.S. products to its import tariff list, retaliating against U.S. duties on $200 billion of Chinese goods that came into effect at 0401 GMT Monday. China also cancelled mid-level trade talks with the United States, as well as a proposed visit to Washington by Vice Premier Liu He which had been scheduled for this week, the Wall Street Journal reported. Soon after the duties went into effect, China accused the United States of engaging in “trade bullyism”, the official Xinhua news agency said. Xinhua cited a white paper on the trade dispute published by the State Council to say China was willing to restart negotiations with the United States in an “equal and mutually beneficial context.” “This shows China will not hold talks under tariff threats,” said Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro-strategy for Westpac. “If the United States is using threat as a tactic, it does not seem to work,” Cheung added. “Markets have low expectation that a deal can be reached  before U.S. mid-term elections.” The intensifying dispute between the world’s two biggest economies has spooked financial markets worried about the impact on global growth. The Japanese yen, which sees fund inflows during times of crisis, held above a recent two-month trough at 112.6 per dollar while the trade-sensitive Australian dollar slipped from a 3-1/2 week top to $0.7263. “Both the U.S. and China are digging in, and increasingly the subtext seems to be as much about advancing a trade ideology as it is about rescinding trade tariffs,” said John Bilton, head of global multi-asset strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management. “As a result, both the extent and depth of any economic impact are being recalibrated,” Bilton said. “So while we continue to be constructive on the global economy over the coming quarters, it is hard to see the current surge in U.S. activity morphing into another period of coordinated global growth.” Britain’s negotiation with European Union will be another key issue for investors, with risks of a ‘no deal’ or ‘hard Brexit’ shooting up again. On Friday, British Prime Minister Theresa May said talks with the European Union had hit an impasse after the bloc’s leaders rejected her “Chequers” plan without fully explaining why. Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Sunday he would back a second Brexit referendum if his Labour Party votes to pursue the move, heaping more pressure on May, amid speculation that she could opt to call a snap general elections. The pound last at $1.3072, slightly above Friday’s $1.3053 which was the lowest since mid-September. The euro eased from a three-month peak on Monday to last trade at $1.1733. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was last at 94.315 to edge above its weakest point since early July touched on Friday. Late last week, the dollar was hammered as investors ramped up bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve will be near the end of its rate-hike cycle after an expected increase this week. Oil prices gained as OPEC’s leader Saudi Arabia and its biggest oil-producer ally outside the group Russia effectively rebuffed U.S. President Donald Trump’s calls for action to lower prices. Brent crude futures gained $1.60 to a four-month peak of $80.3 a barrel while U.S. crude futures shot up $1.3 to $72.10, a level not seen since early July.

2018-09-24,"LONDON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Thousands of people packed the streets of the southwestern Iranian city of Ahvaz on Monday to mourn the victims of an attack on a military parade that killed 25 people, including 12 members of the elite Revolutionary Guards. Saturday’s assault, one of the worst against the most powerful military force of the Islamic Republic, struck a blow at its security establishment at a time when the United States and its Gulf allies are working to isolate Tehran. Iran has declared Monday a national day of mourning. Public offices, banks, schools and universities will be closed in Khuzestan province. Four assailants fired on a viewing stand in Ahvaz where Iranian officials had gathered to watch an annual event marking the start of the Islamic Republic’s 1980-88 war with Iraq. Islamic State’s Amaq agency posted a video of three men in a vehicle who it said were on their way to carry out the attack. A man wearing a baseball cap emblazoned with what appears to be a Revolutionary Guard logo discussed the impending attack in Farsi in the video. “We are Muslims, they are kafirs (non-believers),” the man says. He adds: “We will destroy them with a strong and guerrilla-style attack, inshallah (God willing).” Ahvaz National Resistance, an Iranian ethnic Arab opposition movement which seeks a separate state in oil-rich Khuzestan province, also claimed responsibility for the attack. Senior commanders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) have said the Ahvaz attack was carried out by militants trained by Gulf states and Israel, and backed by America. But it is unlikely the IRGC will strike any of these foes directly. The Guards could put on a show of strength by firing missiles at opposition groups operating in Iraq or Syria that may be linked to the militants who staged the attack. They are also likely to enforce a tight security policy in Khuzestan province, arresting any perceived domestic opponents including civil rights activists.

Speaking at the annual Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC) in Singapore on Monday, Unipec President Chen Bo said improved energy efficiency and technological changes, including the rise of renewables, meant global oil demand growth would slow in coming years and peak at 104.4 million bpd in 2035. Despite trade disputes between China and the United States, he said, U.S. crude supply was an important new source for Chinese refiners as it allows diversification away from Middle East and African crudes, on which China has relied heavily. Trade war tensions between the United States and China will last just “for the time being, and in the future we’ll be active in this area,” he said. Chen Bo also said China would reduce Iranian oil imports because of looming U.S. sanctions against the Middle East country due to start in November, although he added that there had not yet been a decision on how big these cuts would be. Given the current supply and demand dynamic in global markets, he said, crude oil prices between at $60 and $80 per barrel were normal.

U.S. stock futures were a touch weaker while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.6 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was the worst performer, down 1.2 percent. Most of the action was in currencies as financial markets in major Asian centres Japan, China and South Korea were closed for a holiday. Investors were squarely focused on the Sino-U.S. trade war as China added $60 billion of U.S. products to its import tariff list, retaliating against U.S. duties on $200 billion of Chinese goods that come into effect on Monday. China also cancelled mid-level trade talks with the United States, as well as a proposed visit to Washington by vice premier Liu He originally scheduled for this week, the Wall Street Journal reported. The United States, meanwhile, does not have a date for further talks. The intensifying dispute between the world’s two biggest economies has spooked financial markets worried about the fallout on global growth. The Japanese yen, which sees fund inflows during times of crisis, held above a recent two-month trough at 112.6 per dollar while the trade-sensitive Australian dollar slipped from a 3-1/2 week top to $0.7267. “Both the U.S. and China are digging in, and increasingly the subtext seems to be as much about advancing a trade ideology as it is about rescinding trade tariffs,” said John Bilton, head of global multi-asset strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management. “As a result, both the extent and depth of any economic impact are being recalibrated,” Bilton said. “So while we continue to be constructive on the global economy over the coming quarters, it is hard to see the current surge in U.S. activity morphing into another period of coordinated global growth.” There was some optimism generally about Chinese growth as authorities in Beijing step up policy stimulus to offset the economic impact of the tariffs. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said over the weekend China will cut import and export costs for foreign firms as it looks to promote an image of being open for business. Britain’s negotiation with European Union will be another key issue for investors, with risks of a ‘no deal’ or ‘hard Brexit’ shooting up again. On Friday, British Prime Minister Theresa May said talks with the European Union had hit an impasse after the bloc’s leaders rejected her “Chequers” plan without fully explaining why. The pound fell as much as 1.4 percent on Friday, its biggest one-day percentage loss since June 2017. It was last at $1.3074, slightly above Friday’s $1.3053 which was the lowest since mid-September. The euro eased from a three-month peak on Monday to last trade at $1.1739. The dollar’s index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was last at 94.276 to edge above its weakest point since early July. The dollar was hammered late last week as investors ramped up bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve will be near the end of its rate-hike cycle after an expected increase this week. The Fed will end its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. Oil prices gained as OPEC’s leader Saudi Arabia and its biggest oil-producer ally outside the group Russia effectively rebuffed U.S. President Donald Trump’s calls for action to lower prices.

2018-09-24,"(Reuters) - Rain-swollen rivers in North and South Carolina kept rising on Sunday and were forecast to remain at flood level for days, the National Weather Service said more than a week after the landfall of Hurricane Florence, already blamed for at least 40 deaths. As many as 8,000 people in and around Georgetown, South Carolina, have been “strongly urged” to evacuate flood-prone areas along the Waccamaw and Pee Dee rivers early this week, Georgetown County spokeswoman Jackie Broach-Akers told Reuters. Emergency management officials began sending pre-recorded telephone messages to residents in harm’s way over the weekend, and will probably start going door-to-door in the next few days, she said. Authorities expect 5 to 10 feet (1.5 m to 3 m) of flooding in neighbourhoods encompassing some 3,500 homes close to where the two rain-gorged rivers flow into Winyah Bay on the way to the Atlantic, Broach-Akers said. The flood zone includes Georgetown, at the rivers’  confluence, and the coastal resort community of Pawleys Island. The county plans to open emergency shelters at 7 a.m. on Monday, and hotels outside the flood zone in nearby Myrtle Beach are offering discounts for evacuees. Public schools will be closed until further notice, Broach-Akers said. State transportation crews were working to erect temporary dams on either side of U.S. Highway 17, the main coastal route through the area, and National Guard engineers were installing a floating bridge at Georgetown in case the highway is washed out at the river. About 100 miles (160 km) up the coast, a commercial section of downtown Wilmington, North Carolina, by the Cape Fear River was under a foot of water, with flooding expected to rise by a further 2 feet (0.61 m) with high tide on Sunday evening, city spokesman Dylan Lee said. Flooding in Wilmington was expected to peak on Monday along the city’s Water Street riverfront, where many businesses had stacked sandbags in advance, Lee said. But the city said its offices would reopen on Monday after having been closed for a week. Nine days after Florence came ashore, the National Weather Service said flooding would likely persist in coastal parts of the Carolinas for days as the high-water crest of numerous rivers keeps moving downstream toward the ocean. “This isn’t over,” said Bob Oravec, a meteorologist with the NWS’ Weather Prediction Center. “All that water is going to take a good while to recede,” he said. “Damage can still be done. It’ll be a slow drop.” The storm dumped 30 to 40 inches (75 to 100 cm) of rain on the Wilmington area alone after making landfall nearby on Sept. 14.  Floodwaters have begun to recede farther inland. That left hundreds of dead fish stranded on a highway near Wallace, about 35 miles (56 km) from the nearest beach, according to the Penderlea Fire Department, which posted video of firefighters hosing the fish off Interstate 40. “Well, we can add ‘washing fish off of the interstate’ to the long list of interesting things firefighters get to experience!” the department said on Facebook. Remnants of the once-mighty storm brought heavy rains across a wide swath of the country, prompting flood watches and warnings from Texas to Virginia and Maryland, at least through Monday, the weather service said. About 5,000 people across North Carolina have been rescued by boat or helicopter since the storm made landfall, twice as many as in Hurricane Matthew two years ago, according to state officials. Thousands of people remained in shelters.

2018-09-24,"(Repeats with no changes) * Trump's tweets on oil prices: tmsnrt.rs/2MUmIWZ By John Kemp LONDON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - The United States has sent mixed messages to OPEC and its allies over the last week about whether they need to do more to raise oil production and hold down prices. “The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now” President Donald Trump demanded on Twitter on Sept. 20. “We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices,” he complained. “We will remember,” the president added, implying that U.S. security support might be reassessed if OPEC members fail to cut crude prices. But just seven days earlier, the president’s own energy secretary had told reporters that Saudi Arabia, OPEC and Russia “are to be admired and appreciated” for raising their production to avoid a spike in oil prices. The mixed messages illustrate the narrow and difficult path the administration is trying to take imposing tough sanctions on Iran’s oil exports without sending prices sharply higher. The United States is coordinating policy on sanctions and production closely with both Saudi Arabia and Russia; the U.S. energy secretary has met both his Saudi and Russian counterparts in the last fortnight. At the same time, the White House is anxious to avoid being blamed by U.S. motorists for any further escalation in the cost of oil and gasoline, especially in the run-up to a tough congressional election on Nov. 6, but perhaps afterwards too. In effect, there are two separate policies, or at least two different messages, one run by the president, and the other by his administration. It is not unusual for governments to try to run multiple policies and messages, addressed to different audiences and intended to achieve different objectives, though it risks creating confusion and disappointment. The president has criticised OPEC for rising oil prices four times on Twitter this year as well as in an interview with Fox News (tmsnrt.rs/2MUmIWZ). The president’s tweets have generally been prompted when Brent crude prices have recently risen sharply and are in the $75-80 range. From the president’s behaviour, it is possible to infer that he doesn’t want prices to rise above $80 per barrel and would prefer them closer to $70 or even below. The president’s tweets are creating an implicit price target, even if officials have been careful not to specify an explicit one. So far, the president has been careful to blame “OPEC” and unspecified countries in the “Middle East” for rising oil prices, eschewing identifying individual countries by name. As a practical matter, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are the only OPEC members that have significant volumes of spare capacity and could raise output. But all three are close allies of the United States, and Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates have been at the forefront pushing for tough sanctions on fellow OPEC member Iran. The president has so far been careful to avoid embarrassing them by identifying them individually, though his tweets have left no ambiguity about their target. For the time being, the president may be content to complain on Twitter but do little else, in order to avoid being blamed for the rise in oil prices that is a byproduct of his sanctions policy. However, if oil prices continue rising and hit $81-82 or even $85, the president’s tweets may become more pointed and the White House could take tougher action to raise the political pressure on Riyadh. Oil prices are now hovering uncertainly amid dwindling exports from Iran, poor production from other OPEC members and Brazil, decelerating output growth in the United States, and an uncertain consumption outlook. Into that already complicated mix, the president of the United States is now trying to enforce a political price target of $80 or less.

Brent crude futures were at $79.74 per barrel at 0036 GMT, up by 94 cents, or 1.2 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose by 74 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $71.52 a barrel. The market was “increasingly concerned about dwindling (U.S.) inventories,” ANZ bank said on Monday. U.S. commercial crude oil inventories C-STK-T-EIA are at their lowest level since early 2015. And while output C-OUT-T-EIA remains around the record of 11 million barrels per day (bpd), recent subdued U.S. drilling activity points towards a slowdown. The tightening U.S. market came ahead of sanctions that Washington plans to implement against Iran’s petroleum exports from early November, which many analysts expect to result in a drop of more than 1 million bpd of crude exports. The Middle East dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which Iran is a member, as well as top producer Russia are discussing raising output by 500,000 bpd to counter falling supply from Iran, although the discussions are not finalised.
