2018-06-28,"(Reuters) - The United States should help the natural gas industry push back against opposition by environmental groups to pipeline projects by adopting new regulations or laws that favor infrastructure, backers of the industry said at a conference this week. Suppliers in the United States, the world’s biggest natural gas producer, have had a difficult time in recent years getting shipments to some regions, including fuel-hungry New England, as environmental lawsuits by states, green groups and property owners have tied up pipeline construction. The administration of President Donald Trump has said that constraints on pipelines and other energy infrastructure can trigger price spikes and pose a risk to national security but has yet to intervene in state or local-level permitting issues.  “It’s definitely not getting easier to build a new pipeline,” Stanley Chapman, executive vice president and president of U.S. natural gas pipelines at TransCanada Corp, told Reuters on the sidelines at the World Gas Conference in Washington. “I’m seeing more already-approved pipeline projects that are under construction get held up by a judge in lawsuits and this has to be addressed either by FERC or with legislation,” he said. FERC, or the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, oversees construction of new pipelines. TransCanada owns about 30,000 miles (48,280 kilometers) of gas pipeline in the United States, making it one of the country’s biggest operators. It has been trying for more than a decade to build its Keystone XL oil pipeline project linking Canada’s oil sands to U.S. refineries. Other pipeline developers feel the same. “Fifteen years ago nobody cared that much about pipelines, today pipelines are under siege,” said Al Monaco, president and CEO of Enbridge Inc, with over 27,000 miles of gas transmission lines in North America. FERC in April asked stakeholders to submit comments on whether the commission should revise existing pipeline approval policies, yielding feedback from industry backers. “I have encouraged the FERC commissioners that if they move forward in revising this (policy) they should focus on timely review and approval or disapproval of pipeline certificates,” U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, said at the World Gas Conference. She said it was tough for firms to invest in new pipelines when “every regulatory action yields a lawsuit” that “leaves no project safe from the retroactive pulling of permits.”     In recent weeks, environmental groups like the Sierra Club have won court orders delaying construction on EQT Midstream Partners LP’s Mountain Valley pipeline at several locations in West Virginia, and are now seeking a court order to also stop construction in Virginia. “We don’t need these pipelines to meet our energy needs, so it makes no sense to lock us into generations of dependence on dirty fossil fuels,” said Joan Walker, who helps lead the Sierra Club’s Beyond Dirty Fuels Campaign. EQT said it was disappointed and was evaluating legal and regulatory options to continue construction. “If you stop the pipelines, you stop energy development. That’s how the thinking goes,” Enbridge’s Monaco said about the efforts of environmental groups. Mountain Valley is one of several pipelines under construction to move gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale formations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio to consumers in the Southeast, Gulf Coast and Midwest. Production in the Marcellus and Utica, the biggest shale gas formations in the United States, has ballooned to 28.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) from 1.5 bcfd a decade ago, according to federal energy data. One billion cubic feet is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day.  The industry is now eyeing growing export markets by investing in facilities that can liquefy gas for shipment overseas. The United States has sent cargoes to nearly 30 countries in the past year. Senator Capito said it was ironic that U.S. gas is headed around the world but struggles to reach New England. “Right now gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale is being blocked by some of our neighboring states, which cuts off our markets in New England,” she said, referring to New York which spans the Canadian border to the Atlantic. U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said New York’s efforts to stop new pipelines could pose “a national security issue that outweighs the political concerns in Albany, New York.” He said polar vortex weather in the winter or a cyber attack could threaten to leave Wall Street in the dark and hospitals without power. “The leadership (of New York) is keeping pipelines from being built for strictly political purposes,” Perry said. In January, gas prices soared to a record high due to pipeline constraints during an extreme cold spell that forced power generators in New England to resort to burning diesel and Russian imported LNG. New York has denied water permits for a few pipelines from Pennsylvania, including Williams Cos Inc’s Constitution and Northeast Supply Enhancement projects and National Fuel Gas Co’s Northern Access. The New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) said the department has a rigorous review process to protect public health and the environment.

2018-06-28,"(Adds background, financial advisors) By Julie Gordon WASHINGTON, June 28 (Reuters) - Alaska Gasline Development Corp (AGDC) is preparing an equity offering for this summer and is open to partnering with a major energy firm on the development of its costly Alaska LNG export terminal and pipeline project, an executive said on Thursday. “We’re going to be putting forward an equity offering that we will hopefully take out onto the street this summer, to try and attract equity dollars,” AGDC Senior Vice President Frank Richards told Reuters at the World Gas Conference in Washington, D.C. “Now if there are international oil companies that have a desire to participate in the project, we will be glad to talk to them,” he added. The $43 billion development, one of the most expensive U.S.-based LNG projects, is being reviewed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, with a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) expected in March 2019, followed by a final EIS in December 2019. If approved, the 20 million tonne per annum (Mtpa) export project could be operating as soon as the end of 2024, Richards told Reuters at the triennial gathering of global gas players. Owned entirely by the cash-poor state of Alaska, the project has signed preliminary deals with a number of Chinese players, including a development pledge with Sinopec, China Investment Corp and the Bank of China that could amount to up to 75 percent of its offtake. The Alaska LNG development includes an 800-mile (1,287 km) pipeline from the North Slope to south central Alaska, where gas will be distributed for in-state use and to a liquefaction plant to produce LNG for export. Most of the gas from Alaska LNG is expected to go to China, with Sinopec also helping with the marketing, although AGDC also has preliminary deals with other firms. AGDC, which hopes to revive Alaska’s dwindling energy sector, is working with Goldman Sachs and the Bank of China to put together the equity package. (Reporting by Julie Gordon in Washington, D.C.

2018-06-28,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of global stocks eked out a gain as Wall Street closed higher on rises in financial and technology shares on Thursday, but U.S.-driven trade tensions continued to weigh on sentiment and boosted safety buying of Treasuries and German Bunds.  Wall Street technology shares rose a day after slumping on the U.S.-China trade dispute and financial stocks found favour after a 13-day losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 98.46 points, or 0.41 percent, to 24,216.05, the S&P 500 gained 16.68 points, or 0.62 percent, to 2,716.31, and the Nasdaq Composite added 58.60 points, or 0.79 percent, to 7,503.68.  The S&P 500 earlier in the day seesawed between gains and losses, stung by a drop in the S&P health sector after Amazon.com Inc announced the acquisition of online pharmacy PillPack, sparking a selloff in shares of drugstore chains, drug distributors and pharmacy benefit managers.  An escalating trade fight between the United States and major partners, including China, the European Union and Canada, also continued to exert pressure.  “There’s been inconsistency out of the White House as to what the (trade) policy actually is,” said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago. “We’re all just waiting and tapping our foot to see the actual policy.” European shares and Chinese shares reacted to plans outlined late on Wednesday by U.S. President Donald Trump and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow to clamp down on Chinese acquisitions of sensitive American technologies.  After clawing back some ground on Wednesday, the pan-European STOXX 600 and Germany’s trade-sensitive DAX were down 0.8 and 1.4 percent respectively, with technology and carmakers taking the biggest hits. Asian shares dropped to a nine-month trough and MSCI’s emerging market index - which includes other hard-hit countries, including Mexico, Brazil, Turkey and South Africa - was at its weakest in almost a year. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe was up 0.08 pct. U.S. Treasury and German Bund yields remained near one-month lows as investors moved into bonds for the guaranteed returns stocks cannot offer. The yield curve between two-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury notes traded just above the low of 32 basis points reached on Wednesday, which was the flattest since 2007.     A battle over migration policy in Germany’s coalition government additionally boosted demand for safe-haven debt, raising concerns that the euro zone’s biggest economy could be headed for snap elections. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, rose against the safer Japanese yen in the absence of trade-related rhetoric for the day. The dollar was up 0.26 percent against the yen, at 110.54 yen. Gold fell to its lowest level in more than six months on mounting pressure from trade disputes, the expectation of higher U.S. interest rates and a stronger dollar. A strong greenback makes dollar-priced gold costlier for non U.S. investors and while falling equities, seen as risky assets, usually help safe-haven gold, they have failed to do so this time. Oil prices climbed, with U.S. crude hitting a 3-1/2-year high, bolstered by supply concerns due to U.S. sanctions that could cause a large drop in crude exports from Iran. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 69 cents, nearly 1 percent, to settle at $73.45 a barrel. It reached $74.03 earlier in the session, the highest since Nov. 26, 2014.

2018-06-28,"(Fixes typo) By Alissa de Carbonnel and Andrius Sytas BRUSSELS/VILNIUS, June 28 (Reuters) - The leaders of the Baltic states and Poland signed a long-awaited deal on Thursday to connect their power grids to the European Union by 2025 and break their dependence on Russia, a Soviet legacy. Nearly ten years in the making, the politically fraught, technically challenging and costly plan to unplug Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania from Russia comes amid mounting concerns over Russian posturing in the region. The Baltic States, once ruled from Moscow but members of the European Union and NATO since 2004, view being linked into Russia’s power network as a threat to their national security. The agreement, seen by Reuters, was signed with the EU’s chief executive, Jean-Claude Juncker, on the sidelines of a summit of EU leaders in Brussels. It ends years of bickering among the three countries over how best to synchronise their electricity grid with the Continental Synchronous Area of their partners to the west and paves the way for EU funds to be disbursed for the 1 billion euro project. “We worked nine years for the agreement,” President Dalia Grybauskaite told Lithuanian LRT television on Thursday. “This is the last millstone tied to our feet, keeping us from real energy independence,” she said. “That tool of blackmail, which was used (by Russia) to buy our politicians and meddle in our politics, will no longer exist.” Approaching deadlines to tap into EU funding for the project, as well as upgrades to the Russian network which give the former overlord an apparent ability to decouple the Baltics unilaterally, forced the sides to work out a solution. Under the deal, states would use the existing overland LitPol Link between Lithuania and Poland, as well as a new high-voltage direct current cable to run under the Baltic Sea, looping around the territorial waters of Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave. This project, to be confirmed by August, would cost around 560 million euros, a diplomatic source said. “I think this as a historic event which helps to finally solve the question of the energy independence of the Baltic States,” Latvian Minister of Economics Arvils Aseradens told Reuters. The underwater cable will offer 700 megawatts (MW) capacity and could be completed by 2025, Lithuania’s Energy minister Zygimantas Vaiciunas told Reuters. It will be used both for power trading and synchronisation purposes, he added. Brussels is to negotiate with Moscow over how to maintain the power supply to Kaliningrad, which is currently synchronised with mainland Russia through the Baltic states. The deal proposes connecting Kaliningrad with two back-to-back power converters. Russia, on which the Baltic states currently rely to balance their power flows, has never cut power or threatened to do so, but the three EU nations fear it might and say there is a lack of transparency on upkeep of the network in Russia. Lithuania expects Baltic states to test their ability to work autonomously from Moscow in June 2019, before formally switching by 2025. The Russian and Continental European systems both operate at a frequency of 50 Hertz, but are not synchronised. The Russian system is run from Moscow, whereas the continental one is decentralised.

2018-06-28,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices climbed on Thursday, with U.S. crude hitting a three-and-a-half year high, bolstered by supply concerns due to U.S. sanctions that could cause a large drop in crude exports from Iran.  West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 69 cents, nearly 1 percent, to settle at $73.45 a barrel. It reached $74.03 earlier in the session, the highest since Nov. 26, 2014. Brent crude futures rose 23 cents to settle at $77.85 a barrel. The United States this week demanded countries halt imports of Iranian oil from November, a hardline position the Trump administration hopes will cut off funding to Tehran. On Thursday, officials said they would work with countries on a case-by-case basis. China, the biggest importer of Iran’s oil, has not committed to the U.S. position. “The sanctions are trying to isolate Iran a bit more, and that potentially cuts more oil off from the overall global arena as a whole,” said Mark Watkins, a regional investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.  “If you’re having Iran’s oil taken off the market, then you have a decrease in supply and by all means, that’s going to put more pressure on the price of oil to move up.” The U.S. demands follow a decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last week to increase production to try to moderate oil prices that have rallied more than 40 percent over the last year. Oil prices have rallied for much of 2018 on tightening market conditions due to record demand and voluntary supply cuts led by OPEC and other producers including Russia.  Unplanned supply disruptions from Canada to Libya and Venezuela also have supported prices.  U.S crude futures extended gains after data showed inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub fell by 3.1 million barrels in the week through June 26, traders said, citing data from market intelligence firm Genscape. Front-month WTI’s premium to the second month surged after the data and hit a session high of $1.81, while U.S. crude’s discount to Brent narrowed to the smallest in three months at $3.92 a barrel. “You look at the front spreads for crude oil, and it’s been the front-month contracts that have blown out, almost like this is a knee-jerk reaction to a headline versus a long-term structural uptrend that is still intact,” said Brian LaRose, senior technical analyst at ICAP-TA. Not all indicators point toward an ever-tightening market. U.S. crude production is approaching 11 million barrels per day (bpd), and Saudi Arabia expects to match that in coming months as well. But analysts say the market has little spare capacity to deal with further disruptions. “With inventories still declining and spare capacity uncomfortably low, there is very little cushion for any supply disruption caused by rising geopolitical risks,” ANZ bank said.

An escalating trade fight between the United States with major partners, including China, the European Union and Canada, still dominated investors’ mindsets, said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at online forex broker Oanda. “With Trump picking fights on multiple fronts and no sides showing any willingness to back down, we may have to get used to this risk-averse environment in the near-term,” Erlam said.

2018-06-28,"June 28 (Reuters) - The United States should help the natural gas industry overcome environmental challenges to new pipeline projects by adjusting regulations or adopting new laws favoring infrastructure, an executive at TransCanada Corp said at a conference this week. Suppliers in the United States, the world’s biggest natural gas producer, have had a harder time getting shipments to market as more environmental lawsuits by U.S. states, green groups and property owners have tied up pipeline construction. “It’s definitely not getting easier to build a new pipeline,” Stanley Chapman, executive vice president and president of U.S. natural gas pipelines at TransCanada Corp , told Reuters on the sidelines at the World Gas Conference in Washington. “I’m seeing more already-approved pipeline projects that are under construction get held up by a judge in lawsuits and this has to be addressed either by FERC or with legislation,” he said. FERC, or the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, oversees construction of new pipelines. TransCanada owns about 30,000 miles of gas pipeline in the United States, making it one of the country’s biggest operators. It has been trying for more than a decade to build its Keystone XL oil pipeline project linking Canada’s oil sands to U.S. refineries amid ongoing environmental delays. FERC in April asked stakeholders to submit comments on whether the commission should revise existing pipeline approval policies, something that has yielded feedback from industry backers. “I have encouraged the FERC commissioners that if they move forward in revising this (policy) they should focus on timely review and approval or disapproval of pipeline certificates,” U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, said at the World Gas Conference. She said it was tough for energy firms to invest in new pipelines when “every regulatory action yields a lawsuit” that “leaves no project safe from the retroactive pulling of permits.” In recent weeks, environmental groups like the Sierra Club have won court orders delaying construction on EQT Midstream Partners LP’s Mountain Valley pipeline at several locations in West Virginia through federal lawsuits and are now seeking a court order to also stop construction in Virginia. EQT said it was disappointed and was evaluating legal and regulatory options to continue construction. Mountain Valley links West Virginia and Virginia. It is one of several pipelines under construction to transport gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale formations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio to consumers in the U.S. Southeast, Gulf Coast and Midwest where gas demand is growing fast, especially for power generation and LNG export. The Sierra Club says the United States should focus on clean energy sources like wind and solar. “We don’t need these pipelines to meet our energy needs, so it makes no sense to lock us into generations of dependence on dirty fossil fuels,” said Joan Walker, who helps lead the Sierra Club’s Beyond Dirty Fuels Campaign. Walker said she believe FERC currently “acts as a rubber stamp” for energy infrastructure projects. The United States is the world’s biggest producer and consumer of natural gas and is on the cusp of becoming one of its top exporters. Production in the Marcellus and Utica, the biggest shale gas formations in the United States, has ballooned to 28.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) from 1.5 bcfd a decade ago, according to federal energy data. One billion cubic feet is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. The boom came as producers figured out how to use hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling to unlock the gas from the rocks. The industry is eyeing growing export markets by investing in facilities that can liquefy gas for shipment overseas. The United States has sent cargoes to nearly 30 countries in the past year. Capito said it was ironic that U.S. gas is headed around the world but struggles to reach New England. “Right now gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale is being blocked by some of our neighboring states, which cuts off our markets in New England,” she said. New York has denied water permits for a few pipelines that would move gas into the state from Pennsylvania, including Williams Cos Inc’s Constitution and Northeast Supply Enhancement projects and National Fuel Gas Co’s Northern Access. The New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) said the department “subjects all applications for environmental permits to an extensive and transparent review process designed to deny any permit that is found not to be protective of public health and the environment.” Utilities in Boston this winter had to resort to burning diesel and Russian imported LNG to supply enough electricity to consumers during a January cold spell, Capito noted.

2018-06-28,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said on Thursday that bailing out struggling coal and nuclear power plants is as important to national security as keeping the military strong, and that the cost to Americans should not be an issue. “You cannot put a dollar figure on the cost to keep America free,” he told reporters at a press conference in Washington, when asked about the administration’s effort to extend the lives of the facilities. When asked about the cost of a potential bailout, he said he did not yet know. “We look at the electricity grid as every bit as important to (national security) as making sure we have the right number of ships, aircraft and personnel,” he said. “What is your freedom worth?” President Donald Trump ordered the Department of Energy (DOE) to take emergency measures to slow the retirements of coal and nuclear power plants, arguing those kinds of facilities can store months of fuel on site and therefore withstand supply disruptions that could be caused by storms, hacks, or physical attacks. The effort fits neatly with the administration’s broader agenda to boost U.S. fossil fuels production and to save the coal industry, but has been criticized by an unusual alliance of drillers, renewable energy advocates, environmentalists, regulators and grid operators who say it is unnecessary and unfair. Aging coal and nuclear facilities have been shuttering at a rapid pace in recent years, pushed out by cheaper natural gas as well as renewable energy sources like wind and solar - a driving factor in declining U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases.  The Trump administration considers natural gas and renewable energy vulnerable, however, because gas-fired plants rely on pipelines that can be disrupted, and solar and wind facilities only produce energy under certain weather conditions.  Perry pointed out that nearly all U.S. military bases rely on power from the civilian grid. The DOE is currently studying ways to bail out coal and nuclear facilities, including potentially by mandating grid operators to purchase power from them. Perry said the DOE is examining the costs now. Federal energy regulators rejected a previous effort by Perry to require them to subsidize nuclear and coal plants for providing “resilience” to the grid. That did not stop the coal industry from making new requests for help from the administration. In late March, FirstEnergy’s (FE.N) FirstEnergy Solutions unit - which runs coal and nuclear power units - called on the U.S. energy secretary to use the emergency powers to lift the sectors. Coal company CEO Robert Murray of Murray Energy, also called for Perry to use emergency powers to save at-risk coal plants.

2018-06-28,"WASHINGTON, June 28 (Reuters) - A strong stakeholder engagement program at a liquefied natural gas export plant on Canada’s West Coast has helped pare the risk of delays and cost overruns for the C$40 billion ($30.1 billion)project, a project executive told Reuters. LNG Canada, currently being reviewed by its joint venture partners ahead of a final investment decision, has focused hard on ensuring government, indigenous people and local communities are on board with the project, Susannah Pierce, LNG Canada’s director of external relations, told Reuters late on Wednesday at the triennial World Gas Conference in Washington, D.C. Strong environmental and First Nation opposition to energy projects has hurt investor confidence in Canada in recent years. Malaysia’s Petronas last year walked away from its Pacific NorthWest LNG project, which was fiercely opposed by local indigenous groups. “I think what industry is figuring out is: it’s not that we can’t design projects from a technical perspective. What’s slowing them down, or what’s not allowing them to be delivered on time or on budget, is the stakeholder issue,” Pierce said. LNG Canada has been endorsed by its local First Nation community and enjoys strong support within the host town of Kitimat, British Columbia. The province has also backed the project, offering tax cuts and power perks. The associated pipeline, meanwhile, announced this week C$620 million in construction contracts awarded to First Nation groups along the route. “All of these things are lining up to show that there is the stakeholder support that our joint venture participants should feel confident in in making a decision to move the project forward,” Pierce said. LNG Canada is a joint venture between Anglo-Dutch giant Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Malaysia’s Petronas, PetroChina Co Ltd, Mitsubishi Corp and Korea Gas Corp. TransCanada Corp is building the pipeline. Pierce added that the partners had been reviewing the final project package for the last six months and LNG Canada remains hopeful that construction will be underway before year end.

2018-06-28,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Coal companies need to make a “fundamental shift” in how they control exposure to coal dust in underground mines to address the recent surge in black lung disease rates, according to a federal report released Thursday. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine report found that even though coal operators largely comply with recently tightened rules requiring monitoring for coal dust, those measures may not be sufficient. “There is an urgent need for monitoring and sampling strategies that enable continued, actual progress to be made toward the elimination of diseases associated with coal mine dust exposure,” said Thure Cerling, a biology professor at the University of Utah who helped write the report.  The report recommends that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Mining Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) improve monitoring and conduct studies on the causes of the resurgence in the disease, which had been nearly eradicated in the 1990s. Cases of the incurable illness, caused by inhaling coal dust, are rising to levels not seen in decades as miners plumb the depths of played-out coal seams using heavy blasting equipment, according to government health officials. A report by the Government Accountability Office released  this month said the federal fund to help coal miners disabled by black lung disease will require a multibillion-dollar taxpayer bailout if Congress does not extend or increase the tax on coal production that funds it. The coal industry has been lobbying Congress to ensure that scheduled reduction in the tax it pays into that fund goes forward, arguing the payments have already been too high. The NAS report says that it is unclear if tougher regulations around coal dust implemented by MSHA in 2014 are effective because many miners with black lung disease got the ailment from exposure that occurred years earlier. “It is important to note that compliance with regulatory requirements by itself is not an adequate indicator of the rule’s effectiveness,” the report said. The report also notes that while the 2014 rules called for the use of continuous personal dust monitors - devices that warn miners if dust concentrations are too high - “only a small fraction of miners are required to use” one during a shift.  Research and development efforts will also be crucial for better understanding the effects of changes in mining methods on miner health.   Reporting By Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Susan Thomas",https://uk.reuters.com/article/coal-blacklung/u-s-coal-industry-needs-fundamental-shift-to-fight-black-lung-report-idUKL1N1TT1PC,28 Jun 2018,"Coal companies need to make

2018-06-28,"(Adds quote, background) By Lesley Wroughton WASHINGTON, June 28 (Reuters) - The United States is prepared to work with countries on a case by case basis to help them reduce imports of Iranian oil as Washington prepares to reimpose sanctions against Tehran in November, a State Department official said on Thursday, suggesting the Trump administration could offer waivers. A senior State Department official said this week that countries will need to cut their imports of Iranian oil to zero from November and exemptions are unlikely. “Our focus is to work with those countries importing Iranian crude oil to get as many of them as possible down to zero by November 4,” a State Department official told Reuters, adding: “We are prepared to work with countries that are reducing their imports on a case by case basis.” Senior Trump administration officials have visited European nations this week and will head to the Middle East and Asia later to pressure countries to reduce their oil supplies from Iran. Washington hopes it will force Tehran to negotiate a follow-up agreement to halt its nuclear program. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from what he called a “defective” nuclear deal agreed between Iran and six world powers in July 2015. That deal sought to curb Tehran’s nuclear capabilities in exchange for the lifting of some sanctions. Trump ordered the reimposition of U.S. sanctions against Iran that were suspended under the accord. “We are serious about our efforts to pressure Iran to change its threatening behavior,” the official said on Thursday. Administration officials said they will press Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states next week to ensure there are enough global oil supplies once sanctions are reimposed on Iran. They did not elaborate on how much additional global supply was needed. Officials have yet to hold talks with China and India, among the largest importers of Iran’s oil, as well as Turkey and Iraq.

2018-06-28,"STUTTGART (Reuters) - Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) labor chief Bernd Osterloh said the German carmaker needed to sell 1 million electric cars by 2025 to comply with proposed European Union anti-pollution rules, a step which may ruin profits. European lawmakers will vote on tightening emissions rules in July to help the bloc cut overall greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. “Of course the auto industry has some homework to do - but if the infrastructure is not there, then it is difficult to convince a person to buy an electric car,” Osterloh told the Stuttgart Press club. Carmakers say governments need to help subsidize the roll out of essential infrastructure, such as charging points on streets and in homes, to help make the vehicles popular. Osterloh, who spoke on Wednesday, said the industry would struggle if electric cars did not gain traction with consumers given the investment companies were having to make to develop the new vehicles. He said without sufficient demand from consumers, carmakers faced a choice between paying fines for exceeding carbon dioxide limits or encouraging sales with knock-down prices too low to earn a profit. “Once prices are ruined, we will never get them back up,” Osterloh said.

Wall Street opened lower amid Amazon’s announcement that it would buy online pharmacy PillPack, moving the e-commerce giant further into the health space. The news sent shares of drug distributors and retailers plummeting. The S&P health sector dropped 0.73 percent, the most among the 11 S&P sectors, while Amazon gained 0.8 percent. The biggest losses include a 10.5 percent drop in Walgreens Boots Alliance, a 9.3 percent tumble in CVS Health and a 10.1 percent fall in Rite Aid shares. Still, gains in financial and technology shares helped U.S. stock indexes remain largely flat. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 12.45 points, or 0.05 percent, to 24,105.14, the S&P 500 gained 1.52 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,701.15 and the Nasdaq Composite added 10.90 points, or 0.15 percent, to 7,455.99. An escalating trade fight between the United States with its major partners, including China, the European Union and Canada, has continued to dominate investors’ mindsets, said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at online forex broker Oanda. “With Trump picking fights on multiple fronts and no sides showing any willingness to back down, we may have to get used to this risk-averse environment in the near-term,” Erlam said. Like Wall Street a day earlier, European shares and the Chinese yuan suffered after U.S. President Donald Trump and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow outlined plans to clamp down on Chinese acquisitions of sensitive American technologies. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.30 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.96 percent. Asian shares dropped to a nine-month trough and MSCI’s emerging market index - which includes other hard-hit countries, including Mexico, Brazil, Turkey and South Africa - was at its weakest in almost a year. U.S. Treasury and German Bund yields remained near one-month lows as investors moved into bonds for the guaranteed returns stocks cannot offer. The yield curve between two-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury notes traded just above the low of 32 basis points reached on Wednesday, which was the flattest since 2007. The U.S. dollar slipped against a basket of currencies as upbeat German inflation data prompted some traders to buy the euro, and data showing the U.S. economy slowed more than previously estimated in the first quarter weighed on the greenback. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was down 0.04 percent at 95.232, after advancing about 1 percent over the last two sessions amid continuing tensions between the United States and its major trading partners. Gold steadied after falling to its lowest in more than six months on the higher dollar. A strong greenback makes dollar-priced gold costlier for non U.S. investors and while falling equities, seen as risky assets, usually help safe-haven gold, they have failed to do so this time. Oil prices firmed, with U.S. crude near a 3.5-year high as investors eyed the prospect of a big fall in crude exports from Iran due to U.S. sanctions. U.S. crude rose 1.29 percent to $73.70 per barrel and Brent was last at $77.66, up 0.26 percent on the day. Additional reporting by Marc Jones, Christopher Johnson,

2018-06-28,"LONDON/FRANKFURT/ZURICH (Reuters) - Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) 2010.SE is considering increasing its holding in Clariant (CLN.S) and pursuing joint ventures as the Saudi firm looks to strengthen ties with the Swiss chemicals group, sources told Reuters. The world’s number four chemical firm bought a 24.9 percent stake in Clariant this year and is expected to intensify research and development with the Swiss specialty chemicals maker as well as hike its stake over time, the sources said. It already has a New Jersey-based partnership with Clariant that licenses chemical process technology to customers including Huntsman (HUN.N) and Akzo Nobel (AKZO.AS). “SABIC’s narrative is clearly not to stay at 25 percent and do nothing,” a person close to the matter said, adding that a combination of businesses would precede any potential merger. In January SABIC said it had no current plans to launch a full takeover of Clariant. However, the Riyadh-based group wants to extract value from its investment in a friendly manner, the sources said, adding that it does not want to be perceived as an aggressive acquirer and any attempt to hike its stake may take time. SABIC declined to comment, while a spokesman for Clariant said it was in ongoing talks with SABIC about “possible future collaboration prospects” and any outcome would be communicated at the appropriate time. Middle Eastern firms have been eager to expand into advanced downstream chemicals operations like the catalysts that Clariant produces to help speed up processes at chemicals plants.  Saudi state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco in 2015 bought half the synthetic rubber business of Germany’s Lanxess (LXSG.DE) for around 1.2 billion euros. The moves show that Saudi companies are increasingly trying to raise their influence outside the kingdom as part of the ambitious Vision 2030 plan which was set out by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify the country’s economy from oil. SABIC, which is 70 percent owned by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund sovereign wealth fund, would initially stop short of taking control of Clariant which has a market value of $7.8 billion, the sources said. Under Swiss takeover rules anybody with 33.3 percent of the shares would have to make an offer for the full company. While SABIC’s purchase of a stake in Clariant ended the Swiss firm’s fight with activist investors, it must be vetted by regulators in countries including Brazil, Germany and Austria.  The sources said the deal would be cleared during the summer and would pave the way to the implementation of closer ties. Clariant’s boss Hariolf Kottmann told investors in March that management viewed SABIC’s commitment as “very positive” and a strategic update would be provided in September. Plastics production is an area where SABIC may implement closer ties with Clariant, two of the sources said. SABIC has a strong plastics business since its $11.6 billion purchase of GE Plastics in 2007 and a combination with Clariant’s would make sense, one of the sources said. Plastics & Coatings accounts for more than 40 percent of Clariant’s 6.4 billion francs in annual sales.  Although the division’s revenue grew by 5 percent last year, producing much of Clariant’s cash flow, its profitability trails that of divisions like catalysts and care chemicals, which include soap and shampoo ingredients. Last year Clariant abandoned a $20 billion deal with U.S. group Huntsman to create the world’s second-biggest specialty chemicals maker behind Evonik (EVKn.DE) after opposition from activist investors.

2018-06-28,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Changes in temperature and rainfall will impact almost half of South Asia in the coming decades, reducing economic growth in one of the world’s poorest regions, the World Bank said. A World Bank report released on Thursday analyses two scenarios - “climate sensitive”, based on collective action by nations to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and “carbon intensive”, which assumes no action on climate change. The report combines future changes in temperature and rainfall with household survey data linking living standards to weather conditions for the first time. More than 800 million people now live in areas predicted to become moderate-to-severe “hotspots”, or affected areas, by 2050 under the carbon intensive scenario, with India accounting for almost three quarters of them, the report said. Moderate hotspots are areas where projected consumption spending declines by 4-8 percent and severe ones are where the drop exceeds 8 percent. “There seems to be some kind of correlation between climate hotspots and water stressed areas,” Muthukumara Mani, a World Bank economist, said. The World Bank’s expectation of about half of India living in moderately or severely-affected areas by 2050 tallies with a federal think tank’s report two weeks ago. This warned that 600 million Indians could suffer high to extreme water stress as the country faces the worst long-term water crisis in its history. Rising temperature and changing monsoon rainfall patterns from climate change could cost India 2.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and depress the living standards of one in every two Indians by 2050, the World Bank report said. In terms of GDP per capita, it predicted changes in average weather would hit Bangladeshis living in severe hotspots the hardest among South Asians. It projected a 14.4 percent fall in income by 2050 for them. The comparative figures for Sri Lanka and India were 10.0 percent and 9.8 percent respectively under the carbon intensive scenario. Nepal and Afghanistan, as well as hilly areas in India, may benefit from the weather changes because of their colder climates. However, their extensive reliance on streams fed by melting snow would mean that higher temperatures may affect timing and availability of water resources. “Climate changes will impact you based on where you live and what you do,” said Mani, who is also the main author of the report. Inland areas would be more affected than coastal areas and mountainous regions, and the most vulnerable would be those dependent on agriculture as their main livelihood, he added. Targeted policies such as enhancing educational attainment, reducing water stress and improving opportunities in the non-agricultural sector could reduce the impact of climate change on living standards, the report added.

2018-06-28,"DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Iran may be Russia’s ally in the Syrian conflict but when it comes to oil, Tehran’s arch-enemy Saudi Arabia takes precedence - if last week’s OPEC meeting in Vienna is anything to go by. Iran had been pushing hard for oil producers to hold output steady as U.S. sanctions are expected to hit its exports, meaning Tehran had little to gain from OPEC production increases that lower oil prices and cut its revenue. But Saudi Arabia and Russia had other ideas. According to three sources close to OPEC and Russia, the world’s two biggest oil exporters agreed in May to work hand in glove to engineer a sizeable increase in oil output - albeit for different reasons. The events in Vienna were the latest example of how Russia and Saudi Arabia have effectively sidelined OPEC, driving policy for their own geopolitical ends and, in the case of Saudi Arabia, often at the behest of the United States. With their end game in mind, Russia first proposed that the combined output of OPEC countries and non-OPEC allies, such as itself, should jump 1.5 million barrels a day (bpd) from July. Their tactic was for Saudi Arabia to then suggest a more modest rise of less than 1 million barrels in the hope it would be acceptable to Iran, the three sources told Reuters. Saudi Arabia was keen to raise output to meet calls from U.S President Donald Trump and major consumers such as India and China to help cool oil prices and avoid shortages, according to Saudi officials including Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih. Russia, meanwhile, was under pressure from its own energy companies to lift caps on output and fight a steep rise in domestic fuel prices that was hurting President Vladimir Putin’s popularity, according to two Russian oil industry sources. In the end, Saudi Arabia pushed through a rise of 1 million bpd at the Vienna meeting, in line with the plan it had agreed with Moscow more than a month earlier.  While Russia’s motivation was mainly for domestic reasons, the outcome also played into Trump’s hands to help lower domestic fuel prices ahead of U.S. midterm elections. ARM-TWISTING OPEC, the organization that triggered the oil shock of 1973 by restricting supplies to countries supporting Israel in the Yom Kippur war, once controlled 40 percent to 50 percent of the world’s oil supply and commanded the full attention of markets. Now, OPEC produces a third of the world’s crude, while Saudi Arabia, combined with non-OPEC members Russia and the United States, pump more. What’s more, their share of the global market is only set to rise, giving the three countries even more influence over the geopolitics of oil. In a bid to revive oil prices after they fell as low as $27 a barrel in 2016, OPEC and its allies struck a deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million bpd from the start of 2017. The pact rebalanced the market and lifted crude to about $75 a barrel. But unexpected outages in Venezuela, Libya and Angola have effectively increased the cuts to some 2.8 million bpd in recent months and U.S. sanctions are expected to cut Iran’s output by a third - all threatening to push crude prices ever higher. Saudi Arabia insisted as recently as April it was too soon to open the taps but Riyadh made a U-turn after its ally the United States called on OPEC to boost supplies.  With Russia on the same wavelength for its own reasons, Iran had to be persuaded. But it was not without a fight, and some arm-twisting from Riyadh and Moscow, OPEC sources said. A day before the official OPEC meeting on Friday, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh stormed out of a gathering of OPEC and non-OPEC allies saying there would be no agreement. But a last minute conversation on Friday morning with Falih and Saudi minister of state for energy affairs Prince Abdulaziz helped convince Zanganeh, according to three OPEC sources.  A veteran of OPEC diplomacy for more than two decades, the prince, a son of King Salman, was instrumental in getting the initial production pact together in 2016. The Saudi ministers thought they had a reasonable case: OPEC needed to act to tame high oil prices hurting consumers and if Zanganeh refused to sign up, Iran risked being isolated by other producers who would increase production anyway, sources said. Zanganeh was also told if the deal was blocked by Iran, it may lead to the withdrawal of Russia from the agreement, the sources said. One of Tehran’s closest allies, Moscow is helping Iran fight to keep Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in power. One Russian energy source said Iran was also keen to keep Moscow on side because it hopes Russia will be able to help it sell crude as the U.S. sanctions bite. The existing OPEC deal dating back from 2016 gave Iran a production quota of 4 million barrels per day. Keeping that deal intact was crucial to Zanganeh, OPEC sources said. Excluding Iran from the new deal would mean a loss of that output quota. “We have 24 countries in the agreement, they can always be 23,” one of the OPEC sources said. Kuwait, Oman and the United Arab Emirates also participated in efforts to convince Iran, according to OPEC sources. Events since the meeting have further underlined how OPEC members are increasingly being left out of crucial production decisions being taken by Saudi Arabia and Russia. When Trump slapped fresh sanctions on Iran in May Saudi Arabia issued a statement the same day saying it was prepared to meet any supply shortage. Riyadh was briefed by Washington a day before the sanctions and was asked to issue the statement, Reuters reported earlier this month. When Washington said this week it was asking customers in Asia and Europe to reduce Iranian oil purchases to zero from November, sources familiar with Saudi oil thinking briefed the market about an imminent rise in Saudi output to a record. It was not clear whether Washington briefed Riyadh this time or whether it asked it to issue a new statement. But as the news about a jump in Saudi output filtered out, oil prices cooled. The Saudi announcement took most OPEC members - and especially Iran - by surprise. Even though the OPEC decision a week earlier was kept deliberately vague last week for both Iran and Saudi to compromise, Falih had promised to only gradually increase its supply by a few “hundreds of thousands of barrels”.     On Tuesday, sources said Saudi output would rise to a new record of 11 million bpd as early as July, a whole 1 million bpd above May, immediately triggering a protest from Iran. “The State Department says it is short and Saudi Arabia says they will produce 11 million bpd in July. I regret to say they are both ridiculing our organization,” Iran’s OPEC governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili told Reuters on Thursday. Saudi sources said the kingdom’s oil output had already started rising substantially above its quota in June, before the OPEC meeting. The only other oil producing country to boost production above its quota in June was Russia.

2018-06-28,"LAGOS, June 28 (Reuters) - The World Bank said on Thursday it had approved a total of $2.1 billion in concessionary loans to fund projects in Nigeria aimed at improving access to electricity and promoting governance. The projects approved by the International Development Association (IDA), the bank’s low-interest arm, are expected to support Nigeria’s economic growth plan. Growth rates in Nigeria have bounced back since the third quarter of 2016, when a recession, its first in 25 years, bottomed out. Growth returned largely due to higher oil prices, with the country relying on crude sales for much of its revenue. However, growth slowed again in the first quarter of 2018, as the country’s non-oil sector struggled. The government expects growth to rise to a pre-recession level of 7 percent by 2020. The World Bank said more than half of the loans would be used to fund power and climate change projects and boost fiscal transparency. It also approved a $7 million grant for nutrition. Nigeria privatised most of its power sector in 2013 but retained control of its dilapidated monopoly transmission grid, often blamed for hobbling growth. The country intends to raise $2.8 billion of debt offshore to help part-finance its 2018 budget and plans to explore all options to lower costs, the debt office head told Reuters. The debt office said it could tap capital markets or concessionary loans from the World Bank after the 2018 budget had been approved.

The government had said in January that it wanted to split the company into two - one for laying pipelines and the other for marketing and petrochemicals - to encourage more transparency between the two operations. “My job is not to create more companies, my job is to create more accessibility through policy,” Dharmendra Pradhan, India’s oil minister said on Thursday. GAIL (India) Ltd is the country’s biggest gas marketing and trading firm and owns most of the nation’s pipelines, giving it a dominant position in the country’s energy market. Investors, private companies and consultants have said that GAIL’s dominance in pipeline infrastructure across the country conflicts with its business of marketing and trading of natural gas. Pradhan said: “Gail must be seen to be transparent,” adding that Gail was working on a model to keep its pipeline and marketing businesses independent of each other. “My job is to create more transparency and a neutral platform so that other companies can also utilise that infrastructure,” Pradhan said. He did not give a reason for the government’s change of position on splitting up the company, which was seen earlier as a move to raise money by selling its marketing arm to a state-owned oil refining and marketing company. The country’s top two refiners Indian Oil Corp Ltd and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd had shown interest in integrating GAIL’s marketing arm with their business. ‘Unbundling’ of GAIL was one of the three key steps towards creating a natural gas marketplace in India, the other two being forming a trading hub and open access to gas pipelines, the head of India’s gas regulator D K Sarraf had told Reuters in April. “The unbundling will happen but not in a physical form,” Sarraf said on Thursday.

2018-06-28,"OSLO (Reuters) - Private equity-backed Neptune Energy has agreed to buy the Norwegian and Danish offshore oil and gas assets of German gas utility VNG, the companies said on Thursday. Headed by former Centrica boss Sam Laidlaw and backed by the Carlyle Group (CG.O) and CVC Capital partners, Neptune seeks to become a leading independent exploration and production (E&P) firm, it added. The transaction follows a deal by Neptune last year to buy the oil and gas unit of France’s Engie (ENGIE.PA) for $3.9 billion. The deal is also a continuation of a trend among European utilities selling out of upstream oil and gas business as their core onshore activity is being challenged by renewable energy. The size of the VNG transaction was not disclosed, but a source close to the deal said it was valued at around 400 million euros ($462.60 million). Neptune declined to comment on the amount it paid. VNG separately said it has decided to reorganise its portfolio over the next few years to help shape a “green, digital, gas-based future”, including a sale of the E&P business it entered in 2006. The acquisition gives Neptune access to over 50 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in reserves and resources, and production of about 4,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day (boepd), with a “significant” ramp-up potential by 2022 when new  developments come on stream, the company said. Via VNG’s assets, Neptune will increase its stakes in Norway’s Njord field, operated by Equinor (EQNR.OL), and acquire the operatorship and a 30 percent stake in the 100 million boe Fenja field, expected to start producing in 2021. “We would like to buy more (assets in Norway), if we get an opportunity,” Laidlaw told Reuters, adding Neptune was also looking at some exploration opportunities. VNG Norge’s portfolio includes a total of 42 licenses, five producing fields and three projects under development off Norway and Denmark.

2018-06-28,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Asian shares hit nine-month lows as trade worries intensify * Chinese shares, yuan reach new lows, Europe dips * Dollar near one-year high * Oil prices steady after U.S. crude hits 3 1/2-year high By Marc Jones LONDON, June 28 (Reuters) - Pressure on world shares from a U.S.-driven trade confrontation mounted on Thursday, as fast-charging oil prices and the latest swoon by China’s currency cranked up the stress in emerging markets. Wall Street looked set for a subdued start after Europe’s the yuan dropped to two-year and six-month lows respectively in Asia. Like Wall Street on Wednesday, they suffered after U.S. President Donald Trump and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow outlined plans to clamp down on Chinese acquisitions of sensitive American technologies. Asian shares reached a nine-month trough and MSCI’s emerging market index - which includes other hard-hit countries, including Mexico, Brazil, Turkey and South Africa - was at its weakest in almost a year. MSCI’s broadest gauge of the world’s stock markets fell to its lowest in almost three months and was on course to post its fourth losing month in the last five. “If the trade war becomes bigger and bigger and bigger, the impact will be very strong,” said Pau Morilla-Giner, London & Capital’s chief investment officer. “You could see tech (stocks) taking a lot of impact ... and you could see some big negative numbers on the main indexes,” though he added he did not expect the situation to escalate to a full-blown crisis at this point. There were other signs too that markets were shaken by the economic impact of the trade conflict. U.S. Treasury and German Bund yields remained near one-month lows as investors moved into bonds for the guaranteed returns stocks cannot offer. The U.S. 2- to 10-year yield curve, whose flattening can be an early warning of recessions, stayed near the 11-year low of 31 basis points it had hit on Wednesday. A dip in Italian yields after it a key bond sale there did suggest some risk appetite was returning, though traders were also eyeing a meeting of European Union leaders likely to lay bare the bloc’s divisions on immigration. It could prove disruptive to markets, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a stalwart through various recent euro zone crises, seeks a broad agreement which looks like proving tricky. “Look for any clues on how Italy positions itself here, because it could have implications for its budget,” said ING euro zone economist Bert Colijn. “If they are constructive and cooperative with some of the European leaders here, then it seems likely that what (finance minister) Giovanni Tria is saying is true - that they are going to be working towards a budget that falls within the lines of what the commission would require them to do.” Analysts earlier cited Italian reports  that tax cuts and a citizens’ income plan would not be introduced next year as another factor boosting Italian government bonds. Two main forces were playing out in the currency markets. The trade tensions initially pushed the dollar - seen as one of the safest investments, especially if U.S. interest rates keep rising - to test a one-year high against a basket of other top currencies. The gains fizzled out by the middle of the European session after rising inflation in some German regions prompted some traders to buy the euro again. That helped relieve the pressure on emerging market currencies like the Turkish lira and South African rand , which had tanked earlier in their local markets after higher oil prices raised growth and inflation concerns. It had come early enough for Asia, though. The Indian rupee hit a record low of 69.09 to the dollar, while Indonesia’s rupiah slumped as much as 0.83 percent to touch its weakest since October 2015. A Reuters poll also showed investors have raised their “short” positions in Asian currencies over the past month, with bets on the Chinese yuan turning bearish for the first time in over a year as Sino-U.S. trade tensions intensify. U.S. crude futures had surged 3.16 percent on Wednesday, rising to as much as $73.06 a barrel, the highest since November 2014, on signs of tight supply. U.S. crude stocks fell nearly 10 million barrels last week while a fall in Canadian exports helped drain supplies of heavy crude across North America. White House pressure on other countries to stop all imports of Iranian oil is seen as creating a shortage, and a power struggle in Libya has left it unclear whether its internationally recognised government or rebels will handle oil exports. U.S. crude futures traded back a touch at $72.46 a barrel, while global benchmark Brent was 16 cents lower at $77.40. “A number of people will be revising higher their assumptions for the loss of Iranian barrels,” Harry Tchilinguirian, strategist at French bank BNP Paribas, told Reuters Global Oil Forum. “If we assume that OPEC and its allies will deliver a near 1 million barrels per day (bpd) increase in production, most of it will be offset by lower volumes out of Iran.” Reporting by Marc Jones, additional reporting by Christopher

2018-06-28,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2IwJMbP By John Kemp LONDON, June 28 (Reuters) - OPEC is changing fundamentally as power in the oil market shifts towards Saudi Arabia, acting in concert with Russia, while the other members of the organisation are increasingly marginalised. In theory, all members of the Organization of the Petroleum Countries are equal, and the group has always taken decisions by consensus (“Statute of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries”, 1961 and 2012). OPEC’s founding statute stipulates that it “shall be guided by the principle of sovereign equality of its member countries” (Article 3). In practice, some members of OPEC have always been more powerful than others, but that imbalance has been widening, with Saudi Arabia becoming the dominant decision-maker. Saudi Arabia’s oil production overtook Iran’s in the 1970s, and the gap has grown steadily wider as a result of the Iranian revolution, the Iran-Iraq war and multiple rounds of sanctions. Saudi Arabia is the only member of the organisation with a large enough share of output to have a measurable influence prices and the budgetary flexibility to adjust its production significantly. In reality, Saudi Arabia decides how much to produce given market conditions, playing the role of swing producer, while the other members of the organisation essentially produce as much as they are technically able. Since the late 1990s, Saudi Arabia has increasingly coordinated production policy with neighbouring Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, largely ending their former rivalry and accusations of cheating. These three Gulf countries have become the core of OPEC, with the other members playing a peripheral role in output policy (tmsnrt.rs/2IwJMbP). The balance of power within OPEC has been shifting towards Saudi Arabia and its allies for the last 20 years, but production problems in other member countries have accelerated the trend in recent years. Venezuela’s output has fallen sharply as a result of mismanagement and internal unrest. Libya’s production has been cut by the country’s civil war. Nigeria and Angola are suffering from chronic production problems. Iran’s output has been hampered by repeated rounds of sanctions. Iraq is the only OPEC member which has experienced a significant increase in output since the country has recovered from the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and ensuing internal security problems. But Iraq has always attempted to maximise output because of its enormous need for revenues to meet heavy budget commitments and it plays little practical role in OPEC’s production policy. Since 2011, Saudi Arabia and its key allies have consistently accounted for around 48-49 percent of total OPEC output (“Statistical Review of World Energy”, BP, 2018). More importantly, Saudi Arabia and its allies account for almost all the organisation’s spare production capacity and therefore almost all its production flexibility. Saudi Arabia and its allies accounted for most of the voluntary production cuts implemented during 2017/18 and now hold most of the spare capacity that could be made available to the market in 2018/19. Saudi Arabia has around 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of unused output capacity, while the UAE has around 330,000 bpd and Kuwait around 220,000, according to the International Energy Agency. Most other members of the organisation have only negligible amounts of unused capacity that could be readily and reliably available to the market (“Oil Market Report”, IEA, June 2018). And among the three Gulf allies, Saudi Arabia has by far the largest production and unused capacity, cementing its role as the de facto leader of OPEC. OPEC’s biggest problem in attempting to manage the oil market has always been its inability to control production from countries which remain outside the organisation. OPEC’s efforts to stabilise and raise prices have frequently been undermined by the growth of alternative sources of supply (Alaska, China, the Soviet Union, the North Sea and now the shale fields of North America). Saudi Arabia, as OPEC leader, has made repeated overtures to non-OPEC countries since the mid-1980s to restrain their production, with uneven success. Since 2016, however, Saudi Arabia has forged an effective working relationship with Russia and a group of other, smaller non-OPEC producers to limit output. Just as Saudi Arabia has dominated OPEC, Russia dominates the group of non-OPEC allies, contributing most of the output, production cuts and spare capacity. In effect, Saudi Arabia and Russia have emerged as joint market managers, with other OPEC and non-OPEC countries relegated to a marginal role. OPEC is no longer the primary decision-making forum for producing countries trying to coordinate policy on output and prices. Real decision-making power has passed from OPEC and its group of allies into the hands of Saudi Arabia and Russia. Saudi Arabia and Russia have been careful to maintain the formal involvement of OPEC and the wider group of countries, known as OPEC+. But the real decisions on production policy are now being made bilaterally and outside the OPEC and OPEC+ structures. The marginalisation of OPEC as a formal decision-making group was evident during the organisation’s meetings in Vienna between June 20 and June 23. Despite four days of discussions, OPEC and OPEC+ failed to reach a detailed agreement on production policy in the second half of 2018. The final communiques issued after the OPEC and OPEC+ meetings did not specify either a formal output ceiling or country allocations. Instead, it was left to Saudi and Russian officials to brief the media afterwards that collective output would increase by around 1 million bpd. Saudi Arabia and Russia will contribute almost all the increase in output, with smaller contributions from Kuwait and the UAE. In theory, this decision was taken by consensus among OPEC and non-OPEC members, with Iran and other members persuaded to give their assent to a vague joint statement. In practice, Saudi Arabia and Russia are likely to have increased their production by 1 million bpd, whether other OPEC and non-OPEC countries agreed or not. If Iran or any other country had walked out of the discussions, it would not have made any practical difference to the amount of oil supplied to the market in the second half of 2018. Saudi Arabia is keen to maintain the formal structure of OPEC and non-OPEC cooperation; the consensus outcome of the meetings was an important step towards that objective. But the preservation of the OPEC+ group masks the fact real power in the oil market has shifted decisively to Saudi Arabia and Russia, with some political input from the United States. Saudi and Russian market power will become even more evident in the second half of 2018, if the two countries proceed with the agreed increase in production. Assuming Saudi Arabia and its two Gulf allies increase their combined production by 700,000-800,000 bpd, their share of total OPEC output will climb above 50 percent for the first time since the mid-1990s. And if Venezuela’s output continues to fall, which seems likely, and Iran’s production is curbed by U.S. sanctions, the three Gulf allies will see their share of OPEC output climb to the highest level since 1981. By 2019, the oil market will have less than 1 million bpd of spare production capacity, essentially all of it located in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia will exercise more market power than at any time since the Iranian revolution and Iraq’s invasion caused Iranian output to plummet in 1980/81. Market power will be in the hands of Saudi Arabia, and to a lesser extent Russia, not OPEC or the broader OPEC+ group. The formal structures of OPEC and OPEC+ decision-making will remain, but real power has shifted elsewhere.

2018-06-28,"PARAISO, Mexico (Reuters) - Until recently, Edgar Barrera enjoyed a life many Mexicans could only hope for. In a few short years, the 36-year-old bookkeeper rose from handyman to white-collar worker at what seemed to be one of the most stable companies in Latin America: state-owned oil firm Pemex. Thanks to Pemex, Barrera met his wife, vacationed on the Mayan Riviera and envisaged a rewarding career without leaving his hometown in Tabasco, a rural state at the southern hook of the Gulf of Mexico where more than half the population lives on less than roughly $92 a month. Then everything changed. Oil prices plummeted, forcing Pemex to cut his and thousands of other jobs across Mexico. An energy reform, meant to spur business with private competitors, struggled to attract immediate investment. And the gang violence that has crippled Mexico over the last decade finally spread to Tabasco, previously a relatively peaceful corner of the country. Mounting consequences, from an economic recession to soaring murder rates, have rapidly made Tabasco one of Mexico’s most troubled states. Its small, but once seemingly solid, middle-class now struggles with a downturn and lurid violence. Barrera himself, after brushes with extortionists and kidnappers who may have once been Pemex colleagues, recently sought asylum in Canada. Paraiso, or “paradise,” is the Tabasco town where Barrera grew up and worked at a Pemex port. It is “now a hell,” he said. It’s little surprise that industry turbulence would hurt Tabasco, home to Mexico’s first petroleum discovery and a state where more than half the economy, and nearly half the jobs, rely on the oil sector. But the extent of the problems has caught locals, industry executives and government officials off guard, especially as criminals increasingly exploit what’s left of any prosperity by targeting Pemex resources, equipment and employees.   “The oil debacle hit us hard,” said Tabasco Governor Arturo Nunez. “It caused social problems that without question are contributing to higher crime.” President Enrique Pena Nieto, now in his last year in office, made an overhaul of the energy industry his signature initiative, ending Pemex’s longstanding grip on exploration, production, refining and retail fuel sales. Proponents long argued that operators besides Pemex are needed to reverse more than a decade of declining crude output and unlock potential in untapped deposits. But the reform, finalised in 2014, came into law just as global oil prices collapsed, dampening companies’ willingness to invest. Despite a recent rebound, the price of crude in global markets plummeted by as much as 76 percent as of June of that year. Since then, Pemex has slashed nearly 18,000 jobs across Mexico, about 13 percent of its workforce, according to company figures. In Tabasco, Pemex let go 1,857 workers, or roughly 12 percent of the 16,000 jobs the state shed between 2014 and 2016, according to government data. Many of the other layoffs were among suppliers and other businesses that rely on Pemex.   Combined, the cutbacks gave Tabasco Mexico’s highest unemployment rate and mired the state in recession. In 2016, the most recent year for which data is available, Tabasco’s economy shrank by 6.3 percent. It is the only state where both poverty and extreme poverty, defined by the government as monthly income of less than about $50, have risen in recent years. Compounding troubles nationwide, the woes have eroded support ahead of a July 1 presidential election for Pena Nieto’s successor as the candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. Instead, a leftist former Mexico City mayor – and native son of Tabasco – dominates polls. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the 64-year-old frontrunner, promises to build a refinery in his home state.   Although Pemex has recently begun to hire back a few workers, other companies have been reluctant to invest in states like Tabasco, where oil production is now nearly 70 percent below a peak in the early 1990s. With supply abundant worldwide, and an ever-growing flow of crude from U.S. shale, would-be investors are wary of Mexico’s crime, corruption and violence. “We decided not to start,” said Javier Lopez, a Texas-based attorney who recently scrapped plans to launch a business trucking fuel from the United States into Mexico. “We really were afraid we’d get a truck stolen, a driver killed.” For more than a decade, Mexico’s government has deployed police, the military and intelligence forces to topple powerful drug kingpins. As they fell, cartels morphed and moved into new rackets, including theft and extortion of businesses in industries from agriculture to mining and oil. Earlier this year, Reuters reported how fuel thieves are crippling Mexico’s refineries and unleashing bloodshed in formerly calm centres of Pemex operations. In Tabasco, police registered 388 murders last year, over triple the number in 2012. Despite a population of 2.4 million people, small compared with many of Mexico’s 30 other states and giant capital district, Tabasco had the fourth-highest kidnapping tally and sixth-highest number of extortions reported last year. Current and former Pemex workers are at both ends of the crimes – some as victims but others as instigators, participants or informants. Emboldened by the impunity and graft that have enabled crime nationwide, some locals have turned to illicit businesses, joining or seeking to start gangs that steal Pemex fuel, machinery and supplies. Others are targeting relatively well-off current and former Pemex workers, such as Barrera. In a statement, Pemex said it “has zero tolerance with any worker involved in any crime.” The company said it cooperates with local, state and federal police to investigate illegal activity, but declined to comment on specific episodes or cases involving individual workers mentioned in this story.   During a recent interview, Carlos Trevino, Pemex’s chief executive, conceded that employees are increasingly at risk because of their jobs and pay. “Petroleros have a better salary than many other people,” he said, using the Spanish term for oil industry workers. Across Mexico, Trevino added, the company is increasing measures to ensure the security of personnel and property. It has taken its name and logo off trucks. It told workers to stop wearing Pemex uniforms off site. Still, he said, “it’s hard to have a completely safe operation.” “This thing in Tabasco,” he added, “it’s not good.”    Mexico’s first known oil discovery took place in Tabasco in 1863. Manuel Gil y Saenz, a priest, was rushing to see his ill mother when his horse’s hoof got stuck in black sludge, according to a local history of the find. Despite warnings by natives that a witch there turned people into salt, the priest returned and began tapping the oil. With partners, he later sold his venture to a British oil company. In 1938, Mexico expropriated foreign-owned oil assets and created Petroleos Mexicanos, as Pemex is formally known. Over the following decades, production grew in other regions along the Gulf coast. In 1972 prospectors found a giant deposit known as the Mesozoic Chiapas-Tabasco oilfield, prompting a rush to develop the state. To handle growing output from Tabasco, Pemex in 1979 began building the Dos Bocas port and terminal in Paraiso, a hot, marshy town of 94,000 people surrounded by cacao and coconut plantations. For locals, who previously subsisted on small-scale agriculture and fishing, “Pemex came and changed our lives,” said Ricardo Hernandez Daza, head of a local union of roughly 3,000 workers who staff many industry sites. Barrera, the auditor now seeking asylum, joined Pemex in 2004.   That year, the country’s oil output reached a record high and opportunities seemed boundless. Mexico was one of many producers poised to benefit from steadily climbing prices as the global industry, before the shale boom, faced “peak oil,” the assumption that most of the world’s supply was known and diminishing. First hired as a maintenance worker, Barrera worked his way up through other positions, got on-the-job training and eventually began reviewing company accounts for a salary of about $2,000 a month. He married a fellow Pemex auditor, bought two cars and enjoyed regular seafood outings with his wife, their daughter and two stepsons. Until oil prices plunged. Barrera weathered initial Pemex layoffs, but in November 2015 was let go. He immediately sought other jobs, but with many others already scrambling for work, he found only occasional freelance assignments. Soon, Paraiso was reeling. Two brothers, Mario and Pedro Maciel, emerged as local crime bosses, according to state prosecutors.  Rumours swirled they had set up a branch of the Jalisco New Generation cartel, known for drug trafficking, fuel theft and countless other crimes across Mexico.   Some Gulf of Mexico oil workers, many of whom come from inland states, were already getting extorted by the cartel on trips into Jalisco New Generation territory. Alayn Herver, a 28-year-old native of the central state from which the cartel took its name, until last year worked on offshore oil rigs that dot the Tabasco shoreline. Because of the intense schedules required there, Herver would spend two weeks on the rigs and then two weeks on leave back home in Jalisco.   In October 2016, while in a bar in his hometown of Ciudad Guzman, a stranger approached him and demanded roughly $1,000, about half his monthly salary. “We know you earn well,” the man said. “Do you want something to happen to you?” At first, Herver thought the man was joking. Outside, though, some of the man’s colleagues awaited in an SUV, ready to take him to an ATM. Herver realized they were members of the Jalisco cartel. He paid the men, who told him a similar payoff would be expected each month. For half a year, Herver complied. The transaction became so routine that the gang members appeared to lose interest. Herver didn’t report the extortion. Like many Mexicans, he was wary of widespread corruption in police ranks and feared they would only make matters worse. The following April, he decided to skip a payment. On his next trip home, in May 2017, local police pulled him over, Herver said. They handcuffed him and put him in their patrol car. “You’ve got yourself into trouble,” he recalled one officer telling him. Alejandro Romero, a senior officer with the Ciudad Guzman police force, declined to comment on the incident. The Jalisco state attorney general’s office didn’t respond to requests for comment.   As another policeman followed in Herver’s car, a 2007 Mini Cooper, the officers drove to a spot near the city dump, he said. There, six armed men, including the gang member who first approached him, pummeled Herver. “Pull his pants down,” one of the gangsters said. They beat his bare buttocks with a paddle and repeatedly threatened to rape him. One of the assailants put a gun to his head, while another grabbed his cell phone and began posting live video to Herver’s own Facebook feed. Horrified, friends and family watched, the raw footage shifting from Herver’s drained expression to close-ups of his bloody behind. “I thought they were going to kill me,” Herver said. Instead, they let him go, keeping the Mini as payment. In Paraiso, the Maciel brothers denied connections to the cartel or any such crimes. They published an open letter on Facebook stating they were law-abiding citizens. “We are a family,” they wrote in the letter, “dedicated to its work for Pemex at Dos Bocas,” the port. A worker named Pedro Maciel did, in fact, work for Pemex in Tabasco as recently as 2017, according to a database of company workers reviewed by Reuters. Mario’s name didn’t appear in the registry. For locals, the brothers’ reassurances made little difference.   It was already apparent that a Pemex job wasn’t what it once was. Others besides the Maciel brothers were suspected across Paraiso of using their oil-industry positions as perches from which to steal fuel, extort workers and commit other crimes. Those familiar with the industry say it makes sense that criminals, not just victims, could emerge from the Pemex payroll. Even if not committing atrocities themselves, some employees are believed to cooperate with gangs for their own cut of the proceeds or, merely, out of fear. “They know the guts of the place, so they can provide information,” said Raul Munoz, a former Pemex chief executive, who now has private business with the company in Tabasco and says he faces regular security problems. “Everyone wants a piece of the action.” Barrera, the auditor, and his family soon were swept up in the action. Last October, kidnappers captured a brother-in-law. Days before, after three decades of Pemex service, he had received a retirement bonus of roughly $20,000. Within days, the family cobbled together a ransom of about $30,000. The kidnappers released him. With contact information stolen from his telephone, though, they began calling friends and family, demanding more. The brother-in-law declined to speak with Reuters about the kidnapping.   Like Herver, the family opted not to go to the police. “Pemex’s workforce is contaminated,” Barrera said, echoing family members who believe the kidnapping was planned with inside information. “The workers are feasting on one another.” Last November, Barrera secured a few weeks’ work as a Pemex contractor. The threats grew closer. A colleague told Barrera’s wife, who still works at Pemex, that suspicious men had been asking about her outside the office gates. Colleagues then told Barrera that armed men were waiting outside the office for him, too. Terrified, he slept in the office that night. Enough, he thought. Barrera booked a ticket to Canada, where Mexicans can travel with no visa. He landed in Toronto last Christmas and applied for asylum. He hopes to bring his family, who moved to Villahermosa, Tabasco’s capital, in order to avoid the gangsters in Paraiso. Herver, the rig worker whose beating was streamed live on Facebook, also fled to Canada. “I was doing well at Pemex,” he said. But after the assault, “my only alternative was to leave.” He, too, applied for asylum. A spokeswoman for the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada declined to comment on either case, citing privacy laws.   On January 31, coordinated shootings erupted overnight across Paraiso. Among the dead: the Maciel brothers. Local prosecutors said they were killed in a fuel-theft dispute. Their assassins, prosecutors added, died two months later in a shootout with police. Even what should be legitimate business is getting more violent.   Daza, the local union boss, said his sprawling collective of construction, welding, tubing and other labourers has grown aggressive to protect its share of dwindling oil work. The union is one of many independent labour groups that represent workers and compete with one another for industry jobs. Among other tactics, he admits to assaulting rival union members to keep them from job sites. They wield baseball bats, not firearms or knives, to avoid felony charges, he said.   When strangers in out-of-state rental cars arrive in Paraiso, the union and others like it send members to their hotel to demand work at whatever project they’re planning. If they don’t deliver, the unions sometimes shut sites down. The tactics are not out of the ordinary in a country and industry where corrupt labour leaders are known to bribe both companies and members in exchange for keeping positions filled. But they have also fuelled job losses.   Because of the unions’ demands, oil services companies Oro Negro and Constructora y Perforadora Latina left, depriving Paraiso of 300 jobs, according to a local newspaper report. Neither of the companies, based in Mexico City, responded to requests for comment.   Daza said he has little choice but to use force at a time when the oil business is both the root of Paraiso’s problems and its only hope of recovery. “We’re in danger of extinction,” Daza said. “If nobody comes to save us, we’re screwed.” Additional reporting by Shadia Nasralla in London.

2018-06-28,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran criticized Saudi Arabia’s plan to raise oil output and pressure from the United States on Riyadh do so, saying this was in breach of OPEC’s decision last week and belittled the producer group. OPEC and a group of non-OPEC countries agreed on Saturday that they would return to 100 percent compliance with previously agreed oil output cuts, after months of underproduction by OPEC countries including Venezuela and Angola. Iran’s OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, was reacting to various news reports on Monday and Tuesday that Saudi Arabia would boost output in July to 10.6 million barrels a day, 10.8 million bpd and 11.0 million bpd, up from its OPEC target of 10.058 million bpd.  On Monday, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said the deal by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries may not be enough to relieve the oil market. “The State Department says it is short and Saudi Arabia says they will produce 11 million bpd in July. I regret to say they both are ridiculing our organization,” Kazempour told Reuters. The comments underline the depth of the disagreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia, longtime rivals in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, over the interpretation of OPEC’s deal in Vienna last week.  Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the OPEC deal implied an indirect reallocation of extra production from countries unable to produce more oil to those, such as his own, that are able to do so. Iran strongly disagrees. “In the last meeting of OPEC, our resolution does not allow any member to produce more than their quota, but to try to reach 100 percent compliance,” Kazempour said. “There is no mandate to breach our accord. If they do, it means the State Department is running OPEC.” Before the meeting, Iran had demanded OPEC reject calls from U.S. President Donald Trump for an increase in oil supply, arguing that he had contributed to a recent rise in prices by imposing sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. The U.S. call on Saudi Arabia to raise output comes as the United States has urged countries to cut all imports of Iranian oil from November. Iran, in response, said removing Iranian oil from the  market by then is impossible.

2018-06-28,"* India prepares for cut to Iran oil imports from Nov * Rosneft-promoted Nayara prepares to halt Iran imports * Kuwait, S Arabia, Iraq oil may replace Iran * Oil minister says imports to be driven by national interest (Adds oil minister, paragraphs 5,6) By Nidhi Verma NEW DELHI, June 28 (Reuters) - India’s oil ministry has asked refiners to prepare for a ‘drastic reduction or zero’ imports of Iranian oil from November, two industry sources said, the first sign that New Delhi is responding to a push by the United States to cut trade ties with Iran. India has said it does not recognise unilateral restrictions imposed by the United States, and instead follows UN sanctions. But the industry sources said India, the biggest buyer of Iranian oil after China, will be forced to take action to protect its exposure to the U.S. financial system. India’s oil ministry held a meeting with refiners on Thursday, urging them to scout for alternatives to Iranian oil, the sources said. “(India) has asked refiners to be prepared for any eventuality, since the situation is still evolving. There could be drastic reduction or there could be no import at all,” said one of the sources, who has knowledge of the matter. Indian oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan told reporters in Mumbai that the country would attend to its interests while deciding on oil imports. “We know (that) to have a healthy energy mix, we can get oil from anywhere. The rest depends on geopolitics, and those decisions will be taken based on the situations,” he said. “We will go by our interests. When we decide anything on Iran, we will inform you.” During the previous round of sanctions, India was one of the few countries that continued to buy Iranian oil, although it had to reduce imports as shipping, insurance and banking channels were choked due to the European and U.S. sanctions. The source said this time the situation is different. “You have India, China and Europe on one side, and U.S. on the other... At this moment we really don’t know what to do, but at the same time we have to prepare ourselves to face any eventuality,” said the source. While a State Department official has said that Washington wants Iranian oil buyers to halt imports from November, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has told Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to lessen dependence on Iranian oil. Haley, currently in Delhi, spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo early on Wednesday, before meeting Modi. The U.S. push to curb countries’ imports of Iranian oil comes after President Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers and ordered a reimposition of sanctions on Tehran. Some sanctions take effect after a 90-day “wind-down” period ending on Aug. 6, and the rest, notably in the petroleum sector, following a 180-day “wind-down period” ending on Nov. 4. Under pressure from the U.S. sanctions, Reliance Industries Ltd, the operator of the world’s biggest refining complex, has decided to halt imports. Nayara Energy, an Indian company promoted by Russian oil major Rosneft, is also preparing to halt Iranian oil imports from November after a communication from the government, a second source said. The company has already started cutting its oil imports from this month. Indian Oil Corp, Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd and Nayara Energy, the top three Indian buyers of Iranian oil, did not respond to Reuters’s request for comments. Removing Iranian oil from the global market by November as called for by the United States is impossible, an Iranian oil official told the semi-official Tasnim news agency on Wednesday. The options to find replacements to Iranian oil have widened after OPEC agreed with Russia and other oil-producing allies last week to raise output from July by about 1 million bpd, with Saudi Arabia pledging a “measurable” supply boost but giving no specific numbers. Saudi Arabia’s plans to pump up to 11 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) in July would mark a new record, an industry source familiar with Saudi oil production plans told Reuters on Tuesday. The second source said there were plenty of options available in the market to replace Iranian oil. “There are companies and traders that are willing to give you a 60 day credit, crude is available in the market,” the source said. To boost its sales to India, Iran recently offered virtually free shipping and an extended credit period of 60 days. “We can buy Basra Heavy, Saudi or Kuwait oil to replace Iran. Finding replacement barrels is not a problem, but it has to give the best economic value,” a third source in New Delhi said. Reporting by Nidhi Verma; additional reporting by Promit

2018-06-28,"OSLO (Reuters) - Blackrock, the world’s largest investment company, bought a 197.4 megawatt(MW) wind farm in western Norway through one of its funds and will cover its construction cost, the firm and the project’s previous owner Zephyr both said on Thursday. Zephyr, a Norwegian wind farm developer and operator, will continue to manage the farm’s construction, which will cost about 200 million euros ($231.76 million) and is expected to be completed by the end of 2020. The project will be built on the west coast of Norway, close to the city of Floroe and aluminum maker Alcoa will buy the entire electricity produced for a period of 15 years to power its Norwegian based production plants, they said. The wind farm, called Guleslettene, will carry 47 turbines of 4.2 MW capacity from Vestas and will have an ability to produce enough electricity to power more than 40,000 houses, said Zephyr. The construction cost will be funded by Blackrock’s equity and a long-term loan from Dekabank. After the transaction, the cost of which was not disclosed, Blackrock has $5 billion of renewable energy assets under management, with 170 projects within wind and solar, it said. To date, BlackRock Renewable Power has a total invested portfolio of approximately 4.6 gigawatt (GW) of generating capacity across wind and solar projects located in Norway, Sweden, USA, Canada, Australia, Japan, Ireland, France and Britain.

2018-06-28,"(Updates with fresh Haley comment) By Michelle Nichols and Sanjeev Miglani NEW DELHI, June 28 (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Thursday that a top-level strategic dialogue with India will take place as soon as possible, after Washington put off the meeting for a second time in months. The talks were expected to cover issues including U.S. sanctions against Russia and Iran, arms sales and trade. India and the United States have built close political and defence ties and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis were due to hold joint talks with their Indian counterparts in Washington on July 6. But Pompeo called Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj on Wednesday night to say that the United States had to postpone the meeting because of unavoidable reasons, the Indian foreign ministry said. The so-called two-plus-two talks are the highest level of dialogue between the United States and India and were agreed by U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year. Haley, who is on a visit to New Delhi, told Reuters that the talks were a priority and would happen soon. “It’s not just that it’s going to happen, they are now willing to come here if they need to, or travel to make sure the two plus two happens. It is a priority. It’s something that needed to happen. It’s important,” she said. No new dates have been announced. The meeting was originally planned for April but had to be put off because Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson the previous month and Pompeo went through confirmation hearings before the U.S. Congress. Among the issues on the agenda for next week’s talks were arms sales including the transfer of Sea Guardian surveillance drones to the Indian navy, the first such sale of unmanned aircraft. Haley said the ministers would discuss how Washington can continue to support India “as a provider of regional security, particularly in and around the Indian Ocean.” “These discussions will undoubtedly involve issues like joint exercises and military hardware and technology. But the strategic partnership we hope to build is bigger and more durable than that,” Haley told the India Observer Research Foundation think-tank in New Delhi. Indian officials also planned to discuss the issue of sweeping U.S. sanctions on Russia under which any country engaged with its defence and intelligence sectors could face secondary U.S. sanctions. The U.S. move has threatened a proposed $6 billion air defence missile deal that India is negotiating with Russia to help it counter the ballistic missiles and stealth aircraft that China is developing. Haley, a member of Trump’s cabinet, said the postponement of the meeting in Washington had nothing to do with any policy issues. “The meeting is being discussed right now and being rescheduled as soon as possible. It was a situation that couldn’t be avoided and it will come out publicly in the next few days,” she said. Trade differences between the United States and India are also increasing. Last week, New Delhi raised duties on U.S. farm products in retaliation against Trump’s tariff hikes on steel and aluminium. The U.S. embassy said in a statement that Washington remained committed to a strong relationship with India. “The U.S.-India partnership is a major strategic priority for the Trump administration.” The United States also wants India to cut oil imports from Iran following the reimposition of sanctions that had been suspended under a nuclear accord. “In years to come I am confident that the United States and India will stand shoulder to shoulder in many ways to confront the challenges of the Indo-Pacific region and the world,” Haley said. “Too much is at risk if we fail to do so.” Editing by Robert Birsel",https://uk.reuters.com/article/india-usa-haley/update-1-u-s-says-india-talks-a-priority-after-postponing-twice-idUKL4N1TU3VH,28 Jun 2018,"U.S. Ambassador to the United

2018-06-28,"NEW YORK, June 28 (Reuters) - PJ Solomon has hired Jim McGinnis to head its renewables coverage, the firm said in a statement on Thursday, as the U.S. boutique investment bank seeks to bolster its expertise at a time of heightened interest in clean energy. McGinnis most recently served as founder and chief executive of the financing and investments unit of Irish wind and solar firm Mainstream Renewable Power Ltd, and has more than 25 years of experience in the energy sector including at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Inc, the statement said. PJ Solomon, majority-owned by French bank Natixis since mid-2016, has been adding bankers in its infrastructure, power and renewables segment with Jeff Pollard joining in October from Goldman Sachs to head the bank’s power coverage. Renewable energy generation in the United States has been growing at a significant pace, accounting for over half of the country’s annual added electric capacity in five of the six years between 2012 and 2017. While President Donald Trump’s administration has implemented policies seen as unfavorable to the renewables sector, including the ending of tax credits and tariffs on imported solar panels, demand from states and corporations for more clean energy and the falling cost of technology is expected to support further growth.

2018-06-28,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s Supreme Court ruled on Thursday in favour of the government in a lawsuit brought by owners of the Gassled gas network over tariffs, ending a legal fight the owners said raised questions about Norway as an investment destination. Shareholders in Gassled had argued the government acted unlawfully when cutting pipeline tariffs and that it would cost them a combined 15 billion Norwegian crowns ($1.8 billion) in lost earnings through 2028. “There was no ground to make the change in regulation invalid,” the unanimous five-strong Supreme Court panel said. The case against the government was pursued by four investment companies - Solveig Gas, Silex Gas, Infragas and CapeOmega, which together hold a combined 48.2 percent of Gassled that transports Norway’s gas to the rest of Europe.   Some of the companies involved have said Norway’s unexpected decision to lower gas transportation tariffs would hurt its image as an investment destination. The Nordic country is Europe’s second-largest gas supplier after Russia. While tariffs were cut by 90 percent for some future gas resources that are added to the network, Gassled’s owners will still receive accumulated payment of 122 billion crowns by 2028, a reduction of 14.7 billion, Norway’s energy ministry said. “The owners have received a reasonable return on their investments,” the ministry said in a statement, adding that lower pipeline fees could boost the extraction of offshore gas. The four investment companies were originally owned by Allianz, UBS, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Canada’s Public Sector Pension Investment Board, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and France’s Caisse des Depots. In October 2017, UBS and Caisse des Depots said they were selling their stakes to CapeOmega, but would still help pay legal costs. The government cut tariffs shortly after the four investors bought their stakes in Gassled in 2011 and 2012 from ExxonMobil, Total, Statoil - now know as Equinor - and Royal Dutch Shell for 32 billion crowns. At least two of the partners said they would continue to be “prudent owners”. “We now need to understand this judgement. Today is definitely not the day to decide (on our stance to other investments),” Silex Gas CEO Kurt Georgsen told Reuters. “We will focus on our role in Gassled. We will make sure that Gassled stays,” Solveig Gas CEI Trygve Pedersen said. “That doesn’t say if we will look at other projects in the future or not. I do not want to comment on hypothetical scenarios. So far we have only made investments in Gassled,” he added. The partners will have to pay the state’s legal costs, estimated at over 5.3 million crowns ($646,000), ruled the court.

2018-06-28,"NEW DELHI, June 28 (Reuters) - India’s oil ministry has asked refiners to prepare for a ‘drastic reduction or zero’ imports of Iranian oil from November, two industry sources said, the first sign that New Delhi is responding to a push by the United States to cut trade ties with Iran. India has said it does not recognize unilateral restrictions imposed by the U.S., and instead follows U.N. sanctions. But the industry sources said India, the biggest buyer of Iranian oil after China, will be forced to take action to protect its exposure to the U.S. financial system. India’s oil ministry held a meeting with refiners on Thursday, urging them to scout for alternatives to Iranian oil, the sources said. “(India) has asked refiners to be prepared for any eventuality, since the situation is still evolving. There could be drastic reduction or there could be no import at all,” said one of the sources, who has knowledge of the matter. During the previous round of sanctions, India was one of the few countries that continued to buy Iranian oil, although it had to reduce imports as shipping, insurance and banking channels were choked due to the European and U.S. sanctions. The source said this time the situation is different. “You have India, China and Europe on one side, and U.S. on the other... At this moment we really don’t know what to do, but at the same time we have to prepare ourselves to face any eventuality,” said the source. While a State Department official has said that Washington wants Iranian oil buyers to halt imports from November, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has told Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to lessen dependence on Iranian oil. Haley, currently in Delhi, spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo early on Wednesday, before meeting Modi. The U.S. push to curb countries’ imports of Iranian oil comes after President Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers and ordered a reimposition of sanctions on Tehran. Some sanctions take effect after a 90-day “wind-down” period ending on Aug. 6, and the rest, notably in the petroleum sector, following a 180-day “wind-down period” ending on Nov. 4. Under pressure from the U.S. sanctions, Reliance Industries Ltd, the operator of the world’s biggest refining complex, has decided to halt imports. Nayara Energy, an Indian company promoted by Russian oil major Rosneft, is also preparing to halt Iranian oil imports from November after a communication from the government, a second source said. The company has already started cutting its oil imports from this month. Indian Oil Corp, Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd and Nayara Energy, the top three Indian buyers of Iranian oil, and the oil ministry did not respond to Reuters’s request for comments. Removing Iranian oil from the global market by November as called for by the United States is impossible, an Iranian oil official told the semi-official Tasnim news agency on Wednesday. The options to find replacements to Iranian oil have widened after OPEC agreed with Russia and other oil-producing allies last week to raise output from July by about 1 million bpd, with Saudi Arabia pledging a “measurable” supply boost but giving no specific numbers. Saudi Arabia’s plans to pump up to 11 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) in July would mark a new record, an industry source familiar with Saudi oil production plans told Reuters on Tuesday. The second source said there were plenty of options available in the market to replace Iranian oil. “There are companies and traders that are willing to give you a 60 day credit, crude is available in the market,” the source said. To boost its sales to India, Iran recently offered virtually free shipping and an extended credit period of 60 days. “We can buy Basra Heavy, Saudi or Kuwait oil to replace Iran. Finding replacement barrels is not a problem, but it has to give the best economic value,” a third source in New Delhi said. Reporting by Nidhi Verma; Graphic by Gavin Maguire; Editing by

2018-06-28,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP is buying Britain’s top electric vehicle charging firm Chargemaster and will initially roll out its ultra-fast chargers across its filling station network in the UK before turning its attention to China’s rapidly growing market. Oil and gas major Royal Dutch Shell and carmakers Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Daimler have also made investments in the electric vehicle (EV) market, whose growth is being driven by a shift from polluting fossil fuels. Like its rivals Shell and France’s Total, BP is planning to use its vast global network of filling stations to carve out a position in the EV market, with demand for petrol forecast to peak as early as the end of next decade. “We want to have a leading position in the UK whatever fuel choice our customers have,” Tufan Erginbilgic, head of BP downstream, told Reuters after the company announced the 130 million pound ($170 million) acquisition of Chargemaster. BP forecasts that the global EV fleet will soar to more than 300 million by 2040, from just 1 million in 2016, and said it plans to deploy ultra-fast 150 kilowatt chargers able to deliver 100 miles of range in just 10 minutes across its 1,200 petrol stations in Britain over the next 12 months. Although most EV drivers charge their cars at home or at street charging points, Erginbilgic believes that retail stations will remain essential because only they will offer ultra-fast charging. And as carmakers, battery manufacturers and power providers look for ways to extend the use of EVs beyond urban areas, charging on highways is seen as vital for extending range. “If EVs will be a mass-market product, the world needs to have fast and ultra-fast charging,” Erginbilgic said. Chargemaster, which will be rebranded BP Chargemaster, operates more than 6,500 EV charging points across Britain and has supplied over 50,000 units across Europe.     London-based BP plans to invest around $500 million a year in low carbon technology and use its experience in Britain to expand into other rapidly growing markets, first and foremost Germany and China, Erginbilgic said. “China and Germany will definitely be some of the priority markets given the trends… with our ultra-fast charging we can actually enable EV scaling up.” BP announced a partnership in May with China’s NIO Capital to explore investments in EVs, energy infrastructure and battery technology. This followed a joint venture with Shandong Dongming Petrochemical Group to develop retail sites across China. “BP sees the future EV retail market evolving into a model similar to today’s where drivers charge their cars in retail sites,” Erginbilgic said. In January, BP invested $5 million in FreeWire Technologies which manufactures mobile EV rapid charging systems. A month later it linked up with car makers Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi to develop new battery technology.

2018-06-28,"BRUSSELS/VILNUS, June 27 (Reuters) - The leaders of the Baltic states and Poland will sign a long-awaited deal on Thursday to connect their power grids to the European Union grid by 2025 and break their dependence on Russia, a Soviet legacy. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, once ruled from Moscow but now members of the European Union and NATO since 2004, view being plugged into Russia’s power network as a threat to their national security. The agreement, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, will be signed with the EU’s chief executive, Jean-Claude Juncker, on the sidelines of a summit of EU leaders in Brussels. It ends years of bickering among the three countries over how best to synchronise their electricity grid with the Continental Synchronous Area of their partners to the west and paves the way for EU funds to be disbursed for the 1 billion euro project. “We worked nine years for the agreement,” President Dalia Grybauskaite told Lithuanian LRT television on Thursday. “This is the last millstone tied to our feet, keeping us from real energy independence,” she said. “That tool of blackmail, which was used (by Russia) to buy our politicians and meddle in our politics, will no longer exist.” Under the deal, states would use the existing overland LitPol Link between Lithuania and Poland, as well as a new high-voltage direct current cable to run under the Baltic Sea, looping around the territorial waters of Russia’s Kaliningrad enclave. This project, to be confirmed by August, would cost around 560 million euros, a diplomatic source said. Brussels is to negotiate with Moscow over how to maintain the power supply to Kaliningrad, which is currently synchronised with mainland Russia through the Baltic states. The deal proposes connecting Kaliningrad with two back-to-back power converters. Russia, on which the Baltic states currently rely to balance their power flows, has never cut power or threatened to do so, but the three EU nations fear it might and say there is a lack of transparency on upkeep of the network in Russia. Lithuania expects Baltic states to test their ability to work autonomously from Moscow in June 2019, before formally switching by 2025. The Russian and Continental European systems both operate at a frequency of 50 Hertz, but are not synchronised. The Russian system is run from Moscow, whereas the continental one is decentralised.

2018-06-28,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Thursday that a top-level strategic dialogue with India will take place as soon as possible, after Washington put off the meeting for a second time in months. The talks were expected to cover issues including U.S. sanctions against Russia and Iran, arms sales and trade. India and the United States have built close political and defence ties and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Jim Mattis were due to hold joint talks with their Indian counterparts in Washington on July 6. But Pompeo called Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj on Wednesday night to say that the United States had to postpone the meeting because of unavoidable reasons, the Indian foreign ministry said.  The so-called two-plus-two talks are the highest level of dialogue between the United States and India and were agreed by U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.  Haley, who is on a visit to New Delhi, told Reuters that the talks were a priority and would happen soon.  “It’s not just that it’s going to happen, they are now willing to come here if they need to or travel to make sure the two plus two happens. It is a priority. It’s something that needed to happen. It’s important,” she said. No new dates have been announced.  The meeting was originally planned for April but that had to be put off because Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson the previous month and Pompeo went through confirmation hearings before the U.S. Congress. Among the issues on the agenda for next week’s talks were arms sales including the transfer of Sea Guardian surveillance drones to the Indian navy, the first such sale of unmanned aircraft. Indian officials also planned to discuss the issue of sweeping U.S. sanctions on Russia under which any country engaged with its defence and intelligence sectors could face secondary U.S. sanctions. The U.S. move has threatened a proposed $6 billion air defence missile deal that India is negotiating with Russia to help it counter the ballistic missiles and stealth aircraft that China is developing. Haley, a member of Trump’s cabinet, said the postponement of the meeting in Washington had nothing to do with any policy issues.  “The meeting is being discussed right now and being rescheduled as soon as possible. It was a situation that couldn’t be avoided and it will come out publicly in the next few days,” she said.  Trade differences between the United States and India are also increasing. Last week, New Delhi raised duties on U.S. farm products in retaliation against Trump’s tariff hikes on steel and aluminium.  The U.S. embassy said in a statement that Washington remained committed to a strong relationship with India. “The U.S.-India partnership is a major strategic priority for the Trump administration.” The United States also wants India to cut oil imports from Iran following the reimposition of sanctions that had been suspended under a nuclear accord with Tehran.

2018-06-28,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Thursday Tehran was closer to its goal of self-sufficiency in gasoline production after inaugurating the second phase of the Persian Gulf Star Refinery in the southern port city of Bandar Abbas. Weeks after President Donald Trump pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Iran and threatened to reimpose sanctions on Iran, the United States told all countries on Tuesday to stop importing Iranian oil from November. “When under threat of sanctions by our enemy, if we control and reduce our domestic consumption of gasoline ... we can say that we are self-sufficient in fuel production,” Rouhani said in a televised speech.  OPEC member Iran has for years struggled to meet its domestic fuel needs due to a lack of refining capacity and international sanctions that limited the supply of spare parts for plant maintenance. Iran’s Persian Gulf Star Refinery converts light crude, known as condensate, into gasoline and naphtha. Rouhani said that with the inauguration of the new phase, the refinery would produce 24 million litres of petrol per day. “If we can reduce our domestic consumption of 80 million litres of gasoline per day ... we can even export gasoline,” Rouhani said. Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said the refinery, once fully operational, would produce 36 million litres of petrol per day. “With the refinery becoming fully operational, we will have no concerns over sanctions,” he said on Iran’s Oil Ministry website SHANA. Khatam al Anbia Construction Headquarters (KAA), the engineering arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), was one of the main contractors of the project.

2018-06-28,"* Project has secured $7.3 mln in public funding * Sector races to build ever bigger turbines * GRAPHIC-Giant wind turbines: tmsnrt.rs/2rr299K (Adds context on turbines, industry growth) By Stine Jacobsen HELSINKI, June 28 (Reuters) - Danish wind turbine maker Vestas and offshore services firm Maersk Supply Service are teaming up to tackle the cost of transporting and installing ever larger wind turbines. Seeking to remain profitable as European countries phase out subsidies, the industry is turning to ever bigger turbines to harness power more efficiently and respond to pricing pressure for new equipment around the globe. Vestas and fellow Danish company Maersk Supply Service, part of A.P. Moller-Maersk, said on Thursday the initial focus of the partnership would be on developing a new crane to manoeuvre and install mainly onshore but also offshore wind turbines, some of which stand taller than skyscrapers. “The challenge for the industry is that installation and logistics around the turbines become a greater share of the costs,” Bo Svoldgaard, Vestas’ head of innovation and concepts, told Reuters. The crane will be developed with MHI Vestas, an offshore wind joint venture between Vestas and Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Vestas said, adding that it has received 47 million Danish crowns ($7.3 million) in public funding. Investment in new European wind farms and equipment is forecast to rise 4 percent to 23.2 billion euros ($26.8 billion) this year, according to WindEurope, after a shift to competitive tender-based auctions led to a 19-percent decline last year. Last year, MHI Vestas launched a 9.5 megawatts (MW) offshore turbine, currently the world’s most powerful wind turbine, but bigger ones are expected in the future as their efficiency increases with size. General Electric, the world’s fourth-largest wind turbine maker, is working to develop a 12 MW turbine that will stand 260 metres (853 feet) tall. For Maersk Supply Service, the partnership could open up new revenue streams outside the struggling oil service industry at a time when the business is up for sale as part of Maersk’s transformation from conglomerate to a focused shipping firm. A prototype of the crane is expected in the fourth quarter next year, with production starting in two to three years, Svoldgaard said. Both companies declined to comment on the size of investment into the new partnership. ($1 = 0.8669 euros) ($1 = 6.4489 Danish crowns) Additional reporting by Christoph Steitz in Frankfurt

2018-06-28,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China has ramped up purchases of liquefied natural gas (LNG), pulling in rare cargoes from Cameroon, Egypt and Europe, trade data shows, as the world’s most populous nation shores up supplies to avoid power shortages during a prolonged heat wave. Buying has picked up more than it usually would in the warmer summer months, with households cranking up their air conditioners in the face of scorching temperatures since early spring in many areas. Some cities have rationed electricity. Beijing’s push to switch households and factories to cleaner fuel as part of a drive to clear the country’s toxic air and curb coal use has also stoked demand.  And some buyers are already in the market for winter supplies, replenishing inventories earlier than usual, traders said. “Summer gas demand has picked up due to more consumption from gas-fired power plants as temperatures rise,” said Diao Zhouwei, gas analyst with consultancy IHS Markit. “High prices have prompted China to buy spot LNG cargoes from unusual places. The arbitrage window is open between spot prices in Europe and Asia.”  Arrivals so far this month have been 3.9 million tonnes, according to trade flow data from Thomson Reuters Eikon. That would be up 3.6 percent from last year’s official customs data for the month.  Imports of coal, which accounts for the majority of power generation, have also bounced due to decent energy demand.  Arrivals in June have been 26.4 million tonnes, trade flow data shows. That would represent a 22-percent increase from the previous year. Official June data will be released on July 13. Coal supplies from Australia have picked up as key ports in that country recovered from the temporary closure of some berths due to maintenance, which hampered exports for three months. A flurry of vessels due to land in July could create logjams at northern Chinese ports, two coal traders said.          China’s push on gas has pulled in cargoes from suppliers as diverse as Norway and Belgium this month, pushing shipments from northwestern Europe to one of their highest levels on records that go back to January 2013, according to the trade flow data. Cameroon’s first export to China - a 58,000-tonne cargo - landed in Jiangsu this month. That follows the commercial launch of Golar LNG’s (GLNG.O) pioneering floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) platform. A 65,000-tonne shipment from Egypt is scheduled to arrive on July 5, one of only a few from the African nation in recent years. However, it is unclear whether the buying will continue. The opening up of the Northern Sea Route, with a landmark Russian Arctic LNG shipment heading for Asia, may make Russian cargoes more attractive for Chinese buyers, traders said. Some in the industry said buying had already ebbed lightly. “China is still buying, but not aggressively. People are in a ‘wait-and-see’ mode,” an LNG industry source said.

The Africa-focused firm said it has contracted a second rig for its Ghana fields to start work in October on three wells, without increasing its capital expenditure programme. Tullow said it is preparing for the London Commercial Court to decide on a $277 million claim brought by Seadrill over the termination of the West Leo rig contract for force majeure in Ghana. Tullow has set aside $128 million in case it loses. Tullow is also working towards growing output in West Africa in Ivory Coast, where it has farmed out its licenses to Cairn Energy (CNE.L) retaining 60 percent, but with Cairn set to pay for most of the pre-drilling exploration costs. Looking to further output growth, Tullow is due to start exploration drilling in Namibia in September.  For East Africa, Tullow reiterated it planned final decisions in Uganda towards the end of 2018 and in 2019 for Kenya, where it hopes to export up to 2,000 bpd in trucks - before a pipeline is built to the coast. At an average realised oil price of $67 a barrel, Tullow expects to free cash flow of $300 million for the first half year and might cut its net debt to around $3 billion by year-end from around $3.2 at end-June, finance chief Les Wood said. It has hedged 45,000 barrels in the second half at a floor price of $52.23 a barrel and around 8,000 barrels in 2020 at a floor of $55.13.

2018-06-28,"(Adds details) MADRID, June 28 (Reuters) - Spanish consumer prices rose in June at their fastest rate since April 2017, as fuel costs pushed inflation above 2 percent for the second month running, data showed on Thursday. Spain is the first major euro zone economy to report June inflation, to be followed by data for Germany later on Thursday and for the 19-country bloc as a whole on Friday. Spanish EU-harmonised prices rose 2.3 percent, in line with a Reuters poll and above May’s reading of 2.1 percent. National prices also rose 2.3 percent, compared to the 2.2 percent expected by analysts. “This behaviour is due to the rise in fuel (diesel and gasoline) prices compared to the drop seen in 2017,” national statistics office INE said. The Bank of Spain said on Wednesday a spike in inflation at the end of the second quarter was likely to affect consumer purchasing power and could be a drag on the overall economy. European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos said on Tuesday he expected inflation excluding oil and fuel to keep rising across the euro zone as the bloc’s economy remained on track for solid and broad-based growth. The ECB this month decided to end bond purchases by the close of this year, putting an end to years of expansive monetary policy aimed at boosting economic growth and combating low inflation. However, it said it would keep interest rates unchanged at least until after the summer of 2019. Separately, Spanish retail sales fell 0.3 percent in May, INE data showed, the first drop recorded since October.

MSCI ACWI, the benchmark compiler’s broadest gauge of world stocks covering 47 markets, fell 0.17 percent to its lowest level since early April. European stock futures point to fall of 0.2-0.3 percent in major European stock indexes, such as Britain’s FTSE , France’s CAC  and Germany’s DAX . U.S. oil prices hit a 3-1/2-year high as plunging U.S. crude stockpiles compounded supply worries in a market already worried about uncertain Libyan exports, a production disruption in Canada, and Washington’s demands that importers stop buying Iranian crude. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.59 percent to hit a fresh near nine-month low, while Japan’s Nikkei average ended flat after erasing earlier losses. The U.S. S&P 500 lost 0.60 percent on Wednesday to one-month closing low. MSCI’s broadest gauge of the world’s stock markets fell to its lowest level in almost three months, on course to post its fourth losing month in the last five. Its emerging market index hit its weakest level since mid-August. In China, shares remained fragile after taking a battering from worries about a wobbly yuan and the trade dispute with the United States, which has investors braced for a rocky second half of the year. “Chinese stocks have already slid into bear market territory. I have a suspicion that investors are not worrying just about a trade war but are readying for the end of technology-led bull market,” said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Tokyo. “Although it is yet to be seen whether it’s caused by short-term concerns over global trade, not many investors are in the mood to buy stocks today.” The Shanghai Composite index hit a fresh 25-month month low, with both the Shanghai and technology-heavy Shenzhen exchanges falling into bear market territory. South Korea’s tech-heavy KOSPI slipped as much as 1.33 percent to hit its lowest in nearly 10 months. Trump said on Wednesday he would use a strengthened national security review process to thwart Chinese acquisition of sensitive American technologies, a softer approach than imposing China-specific investment restrictions. Although that lifted U.S. stocks initially, optimism quickly evaporated after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Trump’s remarks did not indicate a softened stance on China. Markets remain anxious about Trump’s hard-line approach to trade relations, with early signs his stance may not only be backfiring on him but also hurting the global economy. Two U.S. major auto trade groups on Wednesday warned the administration that imposing tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported vehicles would cost hundreds of thousands of auto jobs, dramatically hike prices on vehicles, and threaten industry spending on self-driving cars. The move came after U.S. motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc said earlier this week it would move production intended for for European markets to outside the United States to avoid retaliatory tariffs. “Initially investors saw Trump’s moves as negotiation tactics to get better deals. But now they are starting to worry about the damage to the economy,” said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities. “People have long thought the U.S. economy will eventually hit a recession at some point. But there are growing worries Trump’s trade policies may hasten that. The fear now is that ‘America First’ may become ‘America Worst’,” he added. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries dropped to 2.827 percent, nearing its May 29 low of 2.759 percent. In worrying sign for some investors, the U.S. yield curve flattened further, with the spread between the two and 10 year yields narrowing to a 10-year low of just 32 basis points, or 0.32 percentage point. Historically, the U.S. economy has tended to enter a recession after the spread had shrunk below zero percent, inverting the yield curve. The fall in U.S. bond yields came despite inflationary pressure from rising oil prices. U.S. crude futures surged 3.16 percent on Wednesday, rising to as much as $73.06 a barrel, the highest since Nov. 28, 2014, on signs of tight supply. U.S. crude stocks fell nearly 10 million barrels last week while the fall in Canadian exports helped drain supplies of heavy crude across North America. White House pressure on other countries to stop all imports of Iranian oil is seen as creating an oil a shortage while a power struggle in Libya has left it unclear whether the internationally recognised government or rebels will handle oil exports. U.S. crude futures last traded at $72.47 a barrel, down 0.40 percent in Asian trade. Copper, seen as a barometer of the strength of global economy because of its wide industrial use, hit a near three-month low of $6,692.5 a tonne. In the currency market, major currencies were treading water on uncertainty over escalating trade friction. The euro was hit by political uncertainty in Germany although Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition partner said it was not seeking to break up the government. The common currency stood at $1.1547, edging towards an 11-month low of $1.1508 set a week ago. The dollar changed hands at 110.32 yen, up slightly but well within its narrow trading range over the past month. The currency is on course to post its smallest monthly range in nearly four years in June.

2018-06-28,"COPENHAGEN, June 28 (Reuters) - Wind turbine maker Vestas and offshore services firm Maersk Supply Service, part of A.P. Moller-Maersk, are teaming up to tackle the cost of transporting and installing ever larger wind turbines. The two companies said on Thursday the initial focus of the partnership would be on developing a new crane to manoeuvre and install turbines that are sometimes taller than skyscrapers. The crane will be developed in cooperation with MHI Vestas, an offshore wind joint venture between Vestas and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Bigger turbines are crucial as the offshore wind industry seeks to remain profitable after European countries phase out subsidies that have provided support since the 1990s. Last year, MHI Vestas launched a 9.5 megawatts (MW) offshore turbine, currently the world’s most powerful wind turbine, but bigger ones are expected in the future. General Electric is working to develop a 12 MW turbine that will stand 260 metres (853 feet) tall. “The challenge for the industry is that installation and logistics around the turbines become a greater share of the costs,” Bo Svoldgaard, Vestas’ head of innovation and concepts, told Reuters. For Maersk Supply Service, the partnership could open up new revenue streams outside the struggling oil service industry at a time when the business is up for sale as part of Maersk’s transformation from conglomerate to a focused shipping firm. A prototype of the crane is expected in the fourth quarter next year, with production starting in two to three years, Svoldgaard said. Both companies declined to comment on the size of investment into the new partnership.

2018-06-28,"* Markets well supplied thanks to high output from top-3 producers * But disruptions, record demand leave little spare capacity By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, June 28 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices dipped from three-and-a-half year highs on Thursday as physical markets remained well supplied despite record demand and ongoing disruptions. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $72.55 a barrel at 0114 GMT, down 21 cents, or 0.3 percent from their last settlement. WTI hit its highest since November 2014 at $73.06 per barrel in the previous session. Brent crude futures were at $77.63 per barrel, virtually unchanged from their last close and still below recent May highs. Oil prices have been rallying for much of 2018 on tightening market conditions due to record demand and voluntary supply cuts led by the Middle East dominated producer cartel of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Unplanned supply disruptions from Canada to Libya and Venezuela have added to those cuts. Yet not all indicators point towards an ever-tightening market. Although output growth is slowing, U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA is approaching 11 million barrels per day (bpd). With Russia and Saudi Arabia at similar levels, and output expected to rise as OPEC and Russia ease their supply restrictions, there will soon be three countries pumping out 11 million barrels of crude each and every day. This unprecedented output means just three countries are meeting a third of world consumption. “The physical oil market is well supplied,” said Konstantinos Venetis, senior economist at research firm TS Lombard, although he warned OPEC and Russia were producing at near maximum output “leaving a thinner margin of safety for the future.” Despite rising U.S. output, U.S. commercial crude oil inventories C-STK-T-EIA dropped by almost 10 million barrels in the week to June 22, to 416.64 million barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday. That’s below the 5-year average level of around 425 million barrels. Traders expect inventories to draw further in coming weeks as an outage of Canada’s Syncrude locks in over 300,000 bpd of production. The outage is expected to last at least through July, according to operator Suncot. The draw in U.S. inventories was also due to high exports of almost 3 million bpd, coupled with domestic refinery activity hitting a utilization rate of 97.5 percent, the highest in more than a decade. Oil demand has been chasing records for most of 2018, but the outlook is dimming amid escalating trade disputes between the United States and other major economies including China and the European Union. “Our macroeconomic view remains overwhelmingly bearish,” commodity brokerage Marex Spectron said. “Credit conditions have worsened again, which is likely to have an outright negative impact on the demand for crude oil in the next 4-6 weeks,” it said.

2018-06-28,"(Reuters) - Australia’s Santos Ltd (STO.AX) said on Thursday it will resume its dividend payment policy earlier than expected, citing a favorable oil price cycle, and sending its shares to a more than one-month high. The board of the country’s No. 2 independent gas producer, which is set to report half-year results in August, approved a new dividend policy targeting a payout range of 10-30 percent of annual free cash flow. Santos flagged in February that it may soon be able to revive dividend payments, which were scrapped in 2016 after the oil price crash cut its ability to service debts from the construction of the Gladstone liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant. “Given the cyclical nature of the industry, the board will also consider additional returns to shareholders above the ordinary dividend when business conditions permit,” the company said in a statement. Santos also said it was on track to achieve its net debt reduction target in the second half of 2018. Two years of deep cost cuts and a rebound in oil and gas prices have helped Santos escape from its massive debt overhang, helping it to meet its debt cutting target about a year ahead of plan. It has also helped the company fend off predators. Santos last month snubbed a $10.8 billion takeover offer from private equity-backed Harbour Energy.

2018-06-28,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The major coal producing province of Shanxi in northern China will impose special emissions restrictions on big industrial sectors by October as part of its bid to curb smog, a local environmental official said. Shanxi, together with neighboring Shaanxi, is set to be included in China’s new three-year action plan to curb air pollution, with emissions in the two provinces second only to the smog-prone Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei industrial region. The province produces more than 900 million tons of coal a year, a quarter of China’s total, and is also a major gas and petrochemical producer.   The new measures will force factories and boilers in the cities of Taiyuan, Yangquan, Changzhi and Jincheng to comply with new restrictions on sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, according to a document circulated by environmental groups. The document’s accuracy was confirmed by an official with the province’s environmental protection agency. He did not want to give his name.  Firms in the thermal power, steel, petrochemical, chemical, non-ferrous metals and cement sectors will be forced to comply with as many as 25 new emissions standards by October. Coking coal producers will be given another year to make the necessary adjustments, the document said. China promised in January to impose “special emissions restrictions” on major industrial sectors in 28 cities in northern China, including the four in Shanxi. It said firms that failed to comply with the deadlines would be fined, ordered to renovate or shut down completely.  The 28 cities were all part of a special winter anti-smog campaign that began in October last year and imposed tough restrictions on traffic, coal consumption and industrial output. In its air quality plan for 2018, Shanxi promised to close down 22.4 million tonnes of annual coal capacity and 1.9 million tonnes of steel capacity this year. It will also create “no-coal zones” and convert thousands of coal-fired boilers to cleaner-burning gas.

The cause of incident was still unknown, Tasnim said. The damage to the plant at Abadan had no impact on oil exports from Iran, the world’s fifth-biggest exporter, as it is involved in producing gasoline and some other fuels, not the production of crude. ISNA reported that one of the injured was in a critical condition. Abadan Oil Refinery is Iran’s oldest crude processing facility in the southern oil-rich Khuzestan Province.

2018-06-28,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text) By Bernadette Christina Munthe and Emily Chow JAKARTA/KUALA LUMPUR, June 27 (Reuters) - Palm oil output in the world’s two-biggest producers may decline amid disruptions in the fruit harvesting process because of a backlog of farmers trying to sell fruit to Indonesian mills and as Malaysian planters struggle with a post-holiday labour shortage. Indonesian smallholder palm farmers have overwhelmed mills as they rush to sell fruit following a longer-than-usual break for the Eid-al-Fitr public holiday, which celebrates the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, causing a drop in fresh fruit bunch (FFB) prices, said planters and grower associations. While millions of Indonesian plantation workers typically take off for the Eid celebrations, this year the government extended the break to two weeks from one to ease traffic congestion, increasing the time the workers were away. “The congestion (at the mills) is caused by planters wanting to sell their FFB at the same time after a long break,” said an Indonesian planter who asked not to be identified, referring to the Eid holiday. “Since there are a lot of FFB ... mills are buying fruits at lower prices day by day because they are (running at) overcapacity.” “We expect a 5 to 8 percent drop of production due to losses of overripe fruit,” he said. Crude palm oil prices that are currently near two-year lows, are also weighing on FFB prices. In Indonesia’s East Kalimantan province, on the island of Borneo, FFB were trading at 800 rupiah ($0.0564) per kilogram, down from 1,500 rupiah three months ago, according to the country’s Oil Palm Farmers Union (SPKS), a smallholders group based in the city of Bogor. Indonesian state media reported this week that farmers in Bengkulu province, on the island of Sumatra, had decided to stop picking palm fruit as FFB prices were as low as 500 rupiah per kilogram, barely covering their costs. “A lot of farmers postponed harvests before Eid,” said Kanisius, the head of the SPKS advocacy division for a region in East Kalimantan. “Now it’s overflowing. After Eid, the harvests are overloaded.” “Many mills are rejecting smallholders’ fresh fruit bunches. They are limiting purchases from farmers,” he said. In Malaysia, Indonesians make up nearly 70 percent of the palm industry’s workforce, a number of which have returned home for the extended Eid holiday, delaying the palm fruit harvest. Despite the holidays being over, many workers have still not returned to the estates yet, said one Malaysian planter who asked not to be identified, leaving plantation owners with fewer workers to pick ripe palm fruit bunches. “We are still struggling with our rounds because most of our workers take two to three weeks leave for Eid. Our harvesting intervals are disrupted,” he said. “There will be some marginal crop losses and the quality will be affected.” ($1 = 14,173 rupiah) Reporting by Bernadette Christina Munthe in JAKARTA and Emily
