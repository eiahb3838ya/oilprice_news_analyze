2018-07-29,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran’s currency hit a new record low on Sunday, dropping past 100,000 rials to the U.S. dollar as Iranians brace for Aug. 7 when Washington is due to reimpose a first lot of economic sanctions. In May, the United States pulled out of a 2015 deal between world powers and Tehran under which international sanctions were lifted in return for curbs on its nuclear programme. Washington decided to reimpose sanctions upon its withdrawal, accusing it of posing a security threat. It has told countries they must halt imports of Iranian oil from Nov. 4 or face U.S. financial measures. On Sunday, the rial plunged to 112,000 on the unofficial market, down from about 97,500 rials on Saturday, according to foreign exchange website Bonbast.com. Other websites said the dollar was exchanged between 108,500 and 116,000 rials.   The rial has lost about half of its value since April because of a weak economy, financial difficulties at local banks and heavy demand for dollars among Iranians who fear the effects of sanctions. The central bank blamed “enemies” for the fall of the currency and a rapid rise in the prices of gold coins and the judiciary said 29 people had been arrested on charges that carry the death penalty.  “The recent developments in the foreign exchange and gold markets are largely due to a conspiracy by enemies with the aim of exacerbating economic problems and causing public anxiety,” the central bank said in a statement read on state television. Judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei told state television: “29 people have been arrested for economic disruption and will be soon put on trial ... More may be arrested tonight and tomorrow.” “Many of them face the charge of ‘spreading corruption on earth’,” Ejei said, referring to a capital offence under Iran’s Islamic laws.   Besides the currency fall, the expected return of sanctions has triggered street protests including by bazaar traders usually loyal to the Islamist rulers, and a public outcry over alleged profiteering and corruption. On Saturday, Ejei said 18 people had been arrested over alleged profiteering from foreign exchange dealings and the illegal importing of luxury cars. U.S. President Donald Trump has called the agreement one of the worst deals ever negotiated but in a bid to salvage the accord, Iran’s European partners in the deal are preparing a package of economic measures.  But France said this month it was unlikely European powers could put the package together before November. On Aug. 7, Washington will reimpose sanctions on Iran’s purchase of U.S. dollars, its trade in gold and precious metals and its dealings with metals, coal and industrial-related software. Sanctions also will be reapplied to U.S. imports of Iranian carpets and foodstuffs and on certain related financial transactions. Iran’s oil exports could fall by as much as two-thirds by this year due to sanctions, straining oil markets amid supply outages elsewhere.

2018-07-29,"* SABIC shares flat, despite Q2 beat * Mood among investors not helped by dip in oil prices * SEC down 4.3 pct in Saudi * Dubai, Abu Dhabi main indexes also lower * Egypt index finishes up 1.2 percent By Tom Arnold DUBAI, July 29 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s stock market slid on Sunday as better-than-expected earnings from Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC), the largest listed company in the Gulf, failed to lift investor sentiment. The mood among investors was not helped by a decline in oil prices, weighed down by a fall in the U.S. equities market. Shares in SABIC were flat after the company reported an 81 percent year-on-year jump in second-quarter net profit to 6.70 billion riyals ($1.79 billion). Analysts had on average expected 5.8 billion riyals. While some analysts believe the stock is overvalued, it is expected to attract further buying by foreign passive funds in anticipation of the Saudi market’s entry into the MSCI and FTSE Russell emerging market indexes next year. Saudi Electricity Co (SEC), the Gulf’s largest utility firm, sank by 4.3 percent after reporting a 17.3 percent drop in second-quarter net profit as revenues from electricity services fell and financing costs rose. The results fell short of two analysts’ forecasts. Saudi Industrial Investment Group fell 7.4 percent, despite reporting a big leap in second-quarter net profit to 321 million riyals, ahead of two analysts’ forecasts. The main stock index closed down 0.7 percent. In Dubai, the main index slipped 0.2 percent, while Emaar Properties fell 1.7 percent and Dubai Investments closed down 1.5 percent. Emaar is expected to report its second-quarter results this week. Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank edged up 1.0 percent after reporting a 12 percent rise in second-quarter net profit on Thursday. First Abu Dhabi Bank dropped 0.7 percent, continuing a decline from the end of last week after reporting a 19 percent year-on-year gain in quarterly profit. The main Abu Dhabi index edged down 0.3 percent. In Egypt, the main index finished 1.2 percent higher, with tobacco manufacturer Eastern Co up 5.1 percent. Commercial International Bank was up 0.8 percent. * The index was down 0.7 percent to 8,307 points. * The index slipped 0.2 percent to 2,942 points. * The index fell 0.3 percent to 4,832 points. * The index was up 0.2 percent to 9,630 points. * The index was up 0.2 percent at 5,389 points. * The index rose 0.1 percent to 1,370 points. * The index edged up 0.06 percent to 4,338 points. * The index was up 1.2 percent to 15,378 points.

2018-07-29,"JOHANNESBURG, July 29 (Reuters) - South Africa’s National Treasury has concluded its  investigation of alleged corruption at state power utility Eskom and state logistics firm Transnet and will give the relevant parties two weeks to respond before making its findings public. In a statement on Sunday the treasury said it had completed a draft report of its investigation into coal supply agreements between Eskom and Tegeta Exploration and Resources - a company owned by the Gupta business family which South Africa’s corruption watchdog accuses of using its relationship with former president Jacob Zuma to wield influence and win government contracts. The report also covers allegations of  misconduct concerning state logistics firm Transnet’s purchase of over 1,000 trains from China South Rail. A judicial inquiry into what has been termed “state capture” - widespread corruption involving billions of rands worth of state contracts during Zuma’s presidency - is due to start next month. International companies affected include global consultancy McKinsey, Germany’s SAP and public relations giant Bell Pottinger. “The report has been given to the relevant parties for comment. These parties have been given two weeks to respond,” the treasury said. Its investigation of Eskom and Tegeta focused on the 2015 sale of Optimum Coal Mine by multinational resource giant Glencore to Tegeta. Zuma and the Guptas have denied wrongdoing. Reuters has not been able to independently verify the allegations. Earlier in July Zuma’s son, Duduzane, was arrested before being granted bail over allegations he took the former deputy finance minister to meeting in 2015 with the Guptas, who - according to the former deputy minister- then tried to bribe him ith 600 million rand  ($45.58 million) in his presence. $1 = 13.1643 rand

2018-07-29,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi suspended his electricity minister on Sunday amid continuing protests over poor public services especially power cuts and rampant corruption, the premier’s office said. It said in a statement that Abadi had also ordered an internal government investigation into Electricity Minister Qassim al-Fahdawi’s role in the deterioration of utility services. There was no immediate comment from Fahdawi. Protests have swept cities in the long neglected south, Iraq’s Shi’ite Muslim heartland, over widespread electricity outages during the blistering hot Iraqi summer, a lack of jobs and proper government services, and pervasive graft. On Saturday, Abadi sacked five local election officials after they were charged with acts of corruption during the May 12 parliamentary election. Abadi’s moves come after Iraq’s top Shi’ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, urged government action to fight corruption to defuse unrest. Public anger is mounting at a time when politicians are struggling to form a new government after a May 12 election that was marred by allegations of fraud, prompting a recount. Abadi, who is seeking a second term in office, is heading a fragile caretaker government for the time being.
