2018-12-04,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced a new NZ$100 million ($69.28 million) green investment fund on Wednesday, aimed at boosting private-sector participation in a campaign to achieve zero net carbon emissions by 2050. “This new investment fund is an important component of New Zealand’s plan to build a clean, sustainable, low-carbon economy that has both lower emissions and profitable enterprises,” Ardern said in an emailed statement. Her center-left government, which also shares a governing support arrangement with the Green Party, has made tackling climate change one of its top priorities.  The 2050 target would put New Zealand in the vanguard of climate change with Norway aiming for net zero emission by 2030 and Sweden by 2045, both by buying international carbon credits and planting trees. However, New Zealand faces a number of challenges in reaching the 2050 target, including reliability issues, when switching the last roughly 20 percent of the power that is produced from fossil fuels to renewable sources.  The economy also relies heavily on agriculture, a major  source of greenhouse gas emissions globally. The green fund would likely target electric vehicles, manufacturing, farming practices and energy-efficient commercial buildings, Ardern’s statement said. The government announced in April that it was halting new offshore oil and gas exploration permits as part of efforts to convert the nation to 100 percent renewable energy by 2035. The measure was criticized by some businesses which said they were not given enough warning, and that the move would scare off investors.

2018-12-04,"Dec 4 (Reuters) - Argentina’s state-controlled energy company YPF and Malaysia’s Petronas are forming a joint venture to invest $2.3 billion over the next four years in the country’s Vaca Muerta shale oil fields, the president’s office announced on Tuesday. State-owned Petronas will have an equal stake in the project through its subsidiary Petronas E&P Argentina SA, the presidency said in a statement. Petronas has not yet commented on the announcement. The Belgium-sized Vaca Muerta deposit, located in western Argentina, is regarded as having the world’s second-largest shale gas and fourth-largest shale oil deposits. “This investment will allow us to increase YPF’s petrol production by 30 percent by 2022, which will represent a total increase for Argentina of 15 percent,” the statement said. The companies’ objective is to reach a production equivalent of 60,000 barrels a day by 2022, it said. Total investment could reach $7 billion within 20 years, it said. Successive governments have targeted Vaca Muerta to reverse Argentina’s energy deficit but the plans have been hindered by a lack of infrastructure. YPF chief executive Daniel Gonzalez told Reuters last month the company would bolster both unconventional oil and gas production by investing between $4 billion and $5 billion per year through 2022. Petronas and YPF have already partnered in pilot exploration and production initiatives and will begin development of the unconventional fuel project in the Amarga Chica block in the province of Neuquen. The announcement is good news for the beleaguered government of Mauricio Macri, which was forced to seek an IMF bailout earlier this year. Macri discussed the deal in a meeting on Tuesday with YPF president Miguel Gutiérrez, Finance Minister Nicolás Dujovne and Energy Secretary Javier Iguacel, the president’s statement said.

2018-12-04,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices pared gains in a volatile trade on Tuesday amid fears that demand would stall due to a trade war between the United States and China, and concerns that Russia remains a stumbling block to a deal to cut global crude supply.  U.S. President Donald Trump made clear he would revert to tariffs on China if the two sides could not resolve their differences. The comments put a damper on market enthusiasm and a major selloff was seen across stocks and other assets, with Wall Street falling more than 3 percent on Tuesday. Oil has pulled back alongside other asset classes in recent weeks, driven by worries about trade and economic growth.  Oil benchmarks gave up Monday’s 4 percent gains, which had come after Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed at a meeting of the Group of 20 industrialized nations (G20) to pause an escalating trade dispute.  In Monday’s session, expectations of a production cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, when they meet on Thursday in Vienna, had also supported prices. OPEC and its allies are working toward a deal to reduce oil output by at least 1.3 million barrels per day, four sources said on Tuesday, adding that Russia’s resistance to a significant production cut was so far the main stumbling block.  “Now we’re starting to get uncertainty on both the trade and production cut fronts and the market is giving back those gains,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “Some of the optimism surrounding the easing of trade tensions seems to be evaporating.” U.S. crude CLc1 settled up 30 cents at $53.25 a barrel after a volatile session that saw the benchmark rally 3 percent to $54.55. Brent crude oil LCOc1 rose 39 cents to settle at $62.08, after earlier touching a session high of $63.58. In post settlement trading, both benchmarks edged slightly lower.  Ahead of the OPEC meeting, Saudi Oil Minister Khalid Al-Falih said it was too soon to be certain that OPEC and other oil exporters would cut production because the terms of a deal remain unresolved.  Al-Falih said he thought the market was oversupplied but he cautioned that all members of OPEC and its allies needed to come together for a cut to go ahead. Trump has put pressure on Saudi Arabia to keep prices low, blaming the kingdom for rising prices.  “A cut in OPEC and Russia production of 1.3 million bpd will be required to reverse the ongoing counter-seasonally large increase in inventories,” Goldman Sachs said in a note. It added that it expected a joint effort by OPEC and Russia to withhold supply to push Brent oil prices “above the mid-$60 per barrel level”. Helping OPEC in its efforts to rein in emerging oversupply was an order on Sunday by the Canadian province of Alberta for producers to scale back output by 325,000 bpd until excess crude in storage is reduced. OPEC’s biggest problem is surging production in the United States, where output - mostly from its shale fields - has grown by about 2 million bpd within a year to more than 11.5 million bpd. C-OUT-T-EIA Barclays bank said in a note to clients that oil production in Texas alone “reached 4.69 million bpd in September, compared with Iraqi output of 4.66 million by our estimates”. Iraq is OPEC’s second-biggest oil producer behind Saudi Arabia.

2018-12-04,"(Corrects headquarters location to Minneapolis from Denver in paragraph 2) Dec 4 (Reuters) - Xcel Energy Inc, one of the largest U.S. utilities, on Tuesday unveiled plans to accelerate its carbon reduction goals, saying sharply lower costs for renewable energy and investments in new technologies will allow it to deliver all carbon-free electricity to customers by 2050. The Minneapolis-based company, which currently produces 60 percent of its power from fossil fuels, said it will slash carbon emissions by 80 percent from 2005 levels by 2030, from a previous target of 60 percent, before going to zero in 2050. It has already slashed those emissions by 35 percent. The company’s ambitions stand in stark contrast to the federal government’s pro-coal agenda under President Donald Trump, because they will likely further erode flagging U.S. demand for coal. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday that U.S. coal demand is projected to hit a 39-year low in 2018, continuing a downward trend fueled by cheap natural gas and increasingly competitive wind and solar energy. Trump has vowed to revive the fossil fuels industries by rolling back Obama-era environmental protections that he argues kill jobs and provide no tangible benefits. Xcel’s announcement also coincides with international climate talks taking place in Poland to hammer out the rulebook for the Paris Agreement, a global accord agreed in 2015 to fight climate change from which Trump has pledged to withdraw. Xcel, which serves 3.5 million customers in eight Midwestern and Western states, called its move the most ambitious ever announced in the electric power industry. In a statement, the utility said its 2030 goal can be reached affordably with renewable energy and other current technologies. To achieve the 2050 goal of all zero-carbon electricity, however, “requires technologies that are not cost effective or commercially available today,” Xcel said. “We’re accelerating our carbon reduction goals because we’re encouraged by advances in technology, motivated by customers who are asking for it and committed to working with partners to make it happen,” Xcel Chief Executive Ben Fowke said in a statement. Xcel’s service territory stretches across Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Texas, New Mexico and Colorado.

There were also clashes in Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux and the city of Orleans, while schools were blocked in Creteil and Versailles near Paris.

2018-12-04,"* MSCI all world index ease 0.1 percent * European share markets continue selloff * Confusion over timing of trade truce, China’s commitments * U.S. yield curve inversion raises recession concerns * Dollar weakens, sterling bounces (Updates with European open, comment) By Karin Strohecker London, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Deflating hopes of a swift resolution to the Sino-U.S. trade war knocked world stocks off a three-week high on Tuesday, while recession warning lights in U.S. bond markets weighed on the dollar. Optimism over a rapprochement between U.S. President Donald Trump and China’s Xi Jinping at the weekend G20 meeting was replaced by scepticism and left Wall Street braced for another day in the red. Adding to market jitters was an inversion of the short end of the U.S. yield curve in bond markets, which historically has signalled a U.S. recession. Asian markets had seen Japan’s Nikkei close 2.4 percent lower after a jump in yen. Europe fared a little better, but London Frankfurt DAX and Paris were all 0.4 to 0.6 percent lower. “The initial relief rally was never going to last. Investors need more detail now in order for that risk-on sentiment to survive,” said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group. “So far that detail has not been coming through, and investors have more questions than answers.” There was added confusion over when the 90-day period, during which the U.S. and China would hold off on imposing more tariffs, would start. A White House official had said it started on Dec. 1, while earlier, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters it would start on Jan. 1. Moreover, none of the commitments that U.S. officials said had been given by China - including reducing its 40 percent tariffs on autos - were agreed to in writing and specifics had yet to be hammered out. Meanwhile, the U.S. yield curve focussed investors’ minds. The curve between U.S. three-year and five-year and between two-year and five-year debt inverted on Monday - the first parts of the Treasury yield curve to invert since the financial crisis, excluding very short-dated debt. Analysts expect the two-year, 10-year yield curve - seen as a predictor of a U.S. recession - to follow suit. On Tuesday, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 2.95 percent compared with its U.S. Monday close of 2.99 percent. And the spread between 10-year and two-year Treasury yields tightened to around 13 basis points - hitting its narrowest level since July 2007. “The focus is now shifting to the inverted U.S. bond yield curve, which has negative connotations, while implying the U.S. economy is heading towards what was only a few weeks ago an improbable economic slowdown,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for APAC at Oanda. “Now, even recessionary fear is starting to raise its ugly head.” However, analysts also said U.S. manufacturing data released on Monday had been reassuringly strong, with new orders a “key driver” in boosting activity. Oil prices also extended gains, adding another 2 percent to Monday’s 4 percent surge, as investors bet a key OPEC meeting on Thursday would deliver supply cuts. Benchmark Brent crude oil jumped by $1.89 to a high of $63.58 before easing back to trade around $63 by 1240 GMT. U.S. light crude was up $1 at $53.95 after earlier gaining more than 3 percent to an intraday high of $54.55. Another major shift was the dollar weakening against the other major world currencies again. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of peers, softened 0.5 percent to 96.53, while the euro added 0.6 percent to $1.1416. Sterling climbed as well after the European Court of Justice’s advocate general said Britain had the right to unilaterally withdraw its notice that it is leaving the European Union. The advocate general’s advice is non-binding, but the prospect of a route out of the Brexit process cheered the market, even as Prime Minister Theresa May pressed ahead with plans for a parliamentary debate on her proposed divorce deal. It saw the pound rise as high of $1.28 versus the broadly weaker dollar. Against the euro, it rose 0.4 percent to a day’s high of 88.9 pence. “The parliamentary debate should reiterate the divisions between and within the political parties, pointing to a low likelihood of the Brexit deal being voted through in Parliament next week,” said Petr Krpata, an currency strategist at ING. The dollar also weakened 0.8 percent against the Japanese yen and fell more than 0.5 percent against the offshore Chinese yuan to 6.83 yuan, its weakest level since September. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was scheduled to testify on Wednesday to a congressional Joint Economic Committee, but the hearing was postponed because of a national day of mourning for U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who died on Friday. The dollar originally came under pressure last week on Powell’s comments that rates were nearing neutral levels, which markets interpreted as signalling a slowdown in the Fed’s rate-hike cycle. In pre-market Wall Street trading, Apple shares were down almost 2 percent after leading the rally on Monday. One of the company’s suppliers, Cirrus Logic, trimmed its revenue outlook, more evidence that the latest iPhones are not selling well. Among the precious metals, spot gold rose as dollar weakened, trading up 0.5 percent at $1,237.24 per ounce. Palladium gained another 2 percent to notch its latest all-time high.

2018-12-04,"MOSCOW, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Russia may delay until March the official launch of its power stations in Crimea, the stations’ engineering firm said, the latest hitch to the plants where Russia is accused of installing German-designed electricity turbines in contravention of sanctions. The company, Tekhnopromeksport, said it had requested the launch be pushed back until spring, citing issues with the supply of key equipment, problems with subcontractors as well as infrastructure. Russia began building two power stations on Crimea to provide electricity to the peninsula which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014, but the facilities became embroiled in a row over sanctions. German engineering firm Siemens says Russia clandestinely delivered several of its turbines to Crimea despite European sanctions which ban the supply of energy technology to Crimea. Russia’s energy ministry says the turbines were not from Siemens. It said they were modernised turbines that were the work of Russian specialists and Russian equipment. German prosecutors are investigating three Siemens employees over the incident. Tekhnopromeksport said the first stage of the power stations will be ready by the end of this year, but that it had requested that the launch of the second phase be delayed until to March. A spokesman for Vice Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak confirmed a possible delay. The energy ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Russia has already delayed the launch several times. It officially pushed the date back to Sept. 1, but when the first station did not launch on time, the date was delayed to October. The stations’ first power units began to supply electricity to the market in October and its official opening date was November, the Russian energy ministry has said. The second phase was meant to start on Oct. 1 at the power station in Sevastopol and on Nov. 1 at the one in Simferopol, according to a government decree.

2018-12-04,"VIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC and its allies are working towards a deal this week to reduce oil output by at least 1.3 million barrels per day, four sources said, adding that Russia’s resistance to a major cut was so far the main stumbling block. OPEC meets on Thursday in Vienna, followed by talks with allies such as Russia on Friday, amid a drop in crude prices caused by global economic weakness and fears of an oil glut due largely to a rise in U.S. production. The producer group’s de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, has indicated a need for steep reductions in output from January but has come under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to help support the world economy with lower oil prices. Possibly complicating any OPEC decision is the crisis around the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. Trump has backed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman despite calls from many U.S. politicians to impose stiff sanctions on Riyadh. The sources, three from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and one from a non-OPEC producer, said the meetings were taking place in a difficult environment and that Russia’s position would be key in reaching a deal. “Russia is playing tough,” one of the OPEC sources said. Another OPEC source said: “The Saudis are working hard on the cut. But if Russia says no cut, then we (OPEC) won’t cut.” The Saudi and United Arab Emirates energy ministers, Khalid al-Falih and Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui, said on Tuesday that an adjustment in global oil output was required but all producers must be on board. “The next road to cross is whether all countries are willing to come on board and contribute to that cut,” Falih told Bloomberg television. Russian sources have indicated Moscow could contribute some 140,000 bpd to a reduction, but Middle East-dominated OPEC insists Russia cut by 250,000-300,000 bpd.            Two sources said talks were focussing on a pro-rata cut of 3.0-3.5 percent from October output levels, with no exemptions for any member. Sources also said OPEC could delay a decision to cut if the main criteria such as Russia’s involvement were not met, even though doing so would mean a further fall in prices. “OPEC can always meet again in February, for example, and decide on a cut then. Those who were not able or willing to cooperate will be wanting to cut then,” one source said. Saudi Arabia previously insisted on a need to reduce production. It was unclear whether the apparent shift in position was caused by OPEC using negotiation tactics to bring Russia on board or by pressure from Trump to refrain from cutting output. For a graphic on OPEC's battle to coax Russia to cut oil output as the US ramps up, see - tmsnrt.rs/2RzCE3J Iraq’s oil minister said OPEC must come up with a medium- to long-term strategy to achieve crude price stability and minimise damage to oil markets caused by geopolitics. Thamer Ghadhban said Iraq would work to help balance markets and bolster prices. Iraq is OPEC’s second-biggest producer after Saudi Arabia. In October 2018, OPEC pumped 32.916 million bpd, while its non-OPEC allies pumped 18.252 million bpd, according to the group’s internal data.

2018-12-04,"(Repeats with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters. ) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Dec 4 (Reuters) - The northern winter usually leads to a demand and price peak for several major commodities in Asia, but this year is bucking the trend for coal, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and iron ore. There doesn’t appear to be one single driving narrative causing the break with the usual seasonal patterns, rather a variety of unrelated, or loosely related factors are at work, but with China as a common thread. LNG provides the most stark example, with the spot Asian price LNG-AS actually weakening at a time when it is usually strengthening. It dropped to $9.80 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in the week to Nov. 30, the weakest since late July. Spot LNG has in the past few years exhibited a strong and reliable seasonal pattern in Asia, rising to a winter-peak before slackening into summer. The peak so far in 2018 has been in summer, when LNG reached $11.60 per mmBtu in June, above the prior winter-high of $11.50 from mid-January. LNG has been influenced by a variety of factors, with summer prices rising because of demand for cooling amid warmer-than-usual weather, and some supply issues, including an outage at Malaysia’s Bintalu project. The winter price surge hasn’t happened largely because China, the world’s second-biggest LNG importer and a major driver of winter demand, is not experiencing the same demand surge as it did last year. In 2017-18, Chinese demand for LNG soared as the country moved sharply to cut back on the use of coal for residential heating over winter amid efforts to mitigate air pollution. However, this winter China appears to have prepared more thoroughly, building up natural gas inventories and being more cautious in the amount of coal-to-gas switching being undertaken. A milder-than-usual winter so far in North Asia has also limited demand for spot cargoes from major buyers such as Japan and South Korea. In coal, the winter-peak experienced since the price recovery started in 2016 has been absent, in part because of the warmer weather, but also because of moves in China to restrict imports. The price of thermal coal at Australia’s Newcastle port , as assessed by Argus Media, was $97.94 a tonne in the week ended Nov. 30. While this was up a touch from the seven-month low of $97.50 a tonne the prior week, it’s still well below the peak of $119.74 reached in mid-July. In common with LNG, China, the world’s biggest coal importer, appears to be playing a role in keeping the polluting fuel from enjoying a winter-peak. Chinese trading companies said the authorities in Beijing have indicated that coal imports are to be wound back for December as part of efforts to keep imports for 2018 around the same level as 2017. That will be difficult as imports for the first 10 months of 2018, at 252 million tonnes, were already within spitting distance of the total of 279 million for the whole of 2017. China’s coal utilities have plentiful inventories for winter amid rising domestic production and it’s believed the authorities are prioritising the consumption of local supplies. Iron ore is another commodity that usually enjoys a strong run in the northern winter, albeit usually toward the tail end as Chinese steel mills start to re-stock ahead of the summer peak demand for steel. This year, iron ore peaked in late February, with the 62-percent grade MT-IO-QIN62=ARG, as assessed by Argus Media, reaching $79.90 a tonne on Feb. 26. But the steelmaking ingredient may have already reached its winter-peak, having hit $77.80 on Nov. 9, and subsequently dropping sharply to a low of $64.55 on Nov. 27. It has recovered somewhat since then to $66.45 a tonne on Monday, but that was most likely because commodities in general got a boost from news of the trade dispute ceasefire between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. Iron ore is declining in tandem with Chinese steel prices, which have been suffering because of a poorer demand outlook and still strong production. Whether iron ore can stage a late winter rally will likely be dependent on whether the market takes the view that China’s infrastructure and construction spending look positive for 2019. Overall it appears that without any deliberate policy moves, China has disrupted the normal season pattern for some of its major commodity imports. This is perhaps an important reminder that the world’s biggest buyer of natural resources can make commodities dance to its tune, even without really trying.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/column-russell-commodities-asia/rpt-column-winter-is-looking-a-little-weird-for-chinas-commodities-russell-idUKL4N1Y929A,04 Dec 2018,"The northern winter

2018-12-04,"PARIS/LONDON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - French cooperative Tereos, the world’s second largest sugar maker, is holding extraordinary elections to its membership council this week which the farmer-owned group hopes will end an internal feud at the debt-laden group already struggling with an industry-wide slump. A sharp fall in sugar prices in the European Union has triggered a crisis in the industry that has also hit rivals such as Suedzucker, Nordzucker and Associated British Foods . For Tereos, the impact of low sugar prices has been particularly harsh due to the company’s heavy debt burden and deep exposure to sugar. Tereos posted a loss last season and is likely to record another in 2018/19, weighed down by its European sugar activities, Chief Executive Alexis Duval told Reuters. As concern over Tereos’ financial situation grew among its 12,000 members, 70 out of 172 elected members of the Council of Regions quit over the summer to protest at management strategy. Council members are designated by cooperative members to represent them at Tereos’ general assembly. The group said this week’s elections to replace them, with results expected on Wednesday, were an opportunity for unity after months of public wrangling. “Make no mistake ... the temptation to pit Tereos people and regions against each other and the chimera to turn in upon ourselves, are deadly poisons for our cooperative,” Francois Leroux, chairman of Tereos’ supervisory board, told cooperative members in a letter last week. Tereos held 15 regional meetings in October to answer cooperative members’ concerns, fueled by two anonymous letters about the group’s “critical” financial condition and an internal rebellion by three resigning board members. The company has been under pressure to reduce its 2.35 billion euro ($2.6 billion) debt burden and boost cash as it looks to offset losses from its sugar operations, which account for nearly half of revenues, with the rest mostly from ethanol, starch and sweeteners. “Tereos has been growing a lot ... but it was mostly funded by internal cash flows or from debt. Because as a cooperative, they cannot raise equity,” said Maxime Puget, director at S&P Global Ratings, which rates Tereos’ bonds. “They have high levels of debt due to previous acquisitions and they have never been able to de-leverage and that’s their problem.” Tereos said in June it was considering selling a minority stake to help it continue growing abroad and diversifying its activities. It is due to unveil initial details of its capital increase around Spring next year. Tereos’ fast expansion, notably in Brazil where it is the third largest sugar maker, has left many of its French sugar beet farmers frustrated because they have received little return from it. “We feel we need to change strategy away from internationalisation and expansion at all costs because that’s where debt came from,” Benoit Mazure, 44, a grower in the Beauce region South of Paris. Three former members of Tereos’ supervisory board voiced strong concern about the group’s future over the summer, asking for more details and transparency. They were expelled from the cooperative for defamation in August, a move seen as extreme by many members. In protest, the dissidents launched a petition in September they say gathered over 2,500 votes to request an extraordinary general meeting. “Reflection about the group’s future has been seriously slowed down by this fight,” said a senior Tereos employee who asked not to be named. “Plus, it doesn’t make the group very attractive for a capital increase.” Industry sources told Reuters that a representative of Tereos’ supervisory board had approached Germany’s Nordzucker this summer to potentially seek capital through a tie-up. Tereos denied that the supervisory or the management board had contacted the German company. Nordzucker declined to comment. “Tereos has not contacted potential investors who can participate in this project today. Neither directly nor indirectly. Because we will have to do some study first and because it is a project for the future. There is no rush,” Duval said. European sugar companies’ profits have plunged as world sugar prices fell to their lowest in a decade this year amid a surge in supplies, partly driven by more output from the EU after it scrapped export and output quotas last year. . Germany’s Suedzucker, the world’s leading sugar maker, slashed its earnings forecast on expectations that sugar prices will fail to recover in the near-term. The group, however, carries less debt and as a publicly listed company has been able to raise cash through equity markets. Sources with knowledge of the company say it is unlikely Tereos will find a partner or go public until sugar prices rebound significantly. Sugar was trading at $351 a tonne on Tuesday morning, up 17 percent from the low touched in August but still well below the $510 traded at the same time in 2016. “With sugar prices at $500 or $600 we would not be in the mess we are today,” said Etienne Clabaut, one of the Tereos supervisory board members who left in July. “There is a danger but we can still bounce back.” (Reporting by Ana Ionova, Jonathan Saul and Nigel Hunt in London; Sybille de La Hamaide, Valerie Parent in Paris; and Michael Hogan in Hamburg Editing by Veronica Brown and Giles Elgood)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/europe-sugar/internal-feud-shakes-french-sugar-group-tereos-as-markets-plunge-idUKL8N1Y855J,04 Dec 2018,"French cooperative Tereos,

Tanzanian President John Magufuli has asked his government to proceed with negotiations to set out the commercial and fiscal framework for the LNG project, Equinor, a majority state-owned energy company formerly known as Statoil, said. “Equinor will now proceed with our partner ExxonMobil with negotiations for a host government agreement,” an Equinor spokesman said in an email to Reuters. He said it was too early to say how long talks with the government could take and how much the project would cost. Tanzania said in 2014 that a planned LNG export plant could cost up to $30 billion. Royal Dutch Shell, which operates deepwater Blocks 1 and 4, adjacent to Equinor’s Block 2, previously sought to develop the LNG project in partnership with Equinor and Exxon Mobil. “Shell continues to work with the government of Tanzania to establish the most cost effective and competitive solution for the LNG project in Tanzania,” a company spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters. “We believe the government is best placed to lead the right way forward to deliver the project,” she added. Shell declined to say whether it would join Equinor and Exxon Mobil or would pursue separate talks with the government. Shell said on its website the three blocks had sufficient gas reserves to build an onshore LNG plant, but the company was not immediately available to comment on whether it would join the other two in starting talks. Shell estimates its two blocks hold about 16 trillion cubic feet (453 billion cubic metres) of recoverable gas, similar to the volumes in Equinor’s Block 2. Reuters reported in June that Exxon Mobil was seeking to sell its 25 percent stake in Block 2 as it was focusing on an even bigger project in neighbouring Mozambique.

2018-12-04,"(Corrects headquarters location to Minneapolis from Denver in paragraph 2) Dec 4 (Reuters) - Xcel Energy Inc, one of the largest U.S. utilities, on Tuesday unveiled plans to accelerate its carbon reduction goals, saying sharply lower costs for renewable energy and investments in new technologies will allow it to deliver all carbon-free electricity to customers by 2050. The Minneapolis-based company, which currently produces 60 percent of its power from fossil fuels, said it will slash carbon emissions by 80 percent from 2005 levels by 2030, from a previous target of 60 percent, before going to zero in 2050. It has already slashed those emissions by 35 percent. The company’s ambitions stand in stark contrast to the federal government’s pro-coal agenda under President Donald Trump, because they will likely further erode flagging U.S. demand for coal. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday that U.S. coal demand is projected to hit a 39-year low in 2018, continuing a downward trend fueled by cheap natural gas and increasingly competitive wind and solar energy. Trump has vowed to revive the fossil fuels industries by rolling back Obama-era environmental protections that he argues kill jobs and provide no tangible benefits. Xcel’s announcement also coincides with international climate talks taking place in Poland to hammer out the rulebook for the Paris Agreement, a global accord agreed in 2015 to fight climate change from which Trump has pledged to withdraw. Xcel, which serves 3.5 million customers in eight Midwestern and Western states, called its move the most ambitious ever announced in the electric power industry. In a statement, the utility said its 2030 goal can be reached affordably with renewable energy and other current technologies. To achieve the 2050 goal of all zero-carbon electricity, however, “requires technologies that are not cost effective or commercially available today,” Xcel said. “We’re accelerating our carbon reduction goals because we’re encouraged by advances in technology, motivated by customers who are asking for it and committed to working with partners to make it happen,” Xcel Chief Executive Ben Fowke said in a statement.

2018-12-04,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stocks tumbled on Tuesday as a flattening Treasury yield curve sparked recession warnings, while optimism sharply waned that the United States and China would quickly resolve their trade dispute.  Benchmark Treasury 10-year yield fell to its lowest point since mid-September. The spread between the 10-year yield over its two-year counterpart also shrank to the smallest since the start of the financial crisis in January 2008, signaling to some investors an approaching U.S. economic slowdown.  “Today is the perfect storm,” said RJ Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. “You’ve nothing really tangible coming out of the G20 summit. You have worries about growth.” MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 2.16 percent, its worst performance since October 11. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 799.36 points, or 3.1 percent, to 25,027.07, the S&P 500 lost 90.31 points, or 3.24 percent, to 2,700.06 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 283.09 points, or 3.8 percent, to 7,158.43. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq will be closed on Wednesday, for a day of mourning for former President George H.W. Bush, who died on Friday at the age of 94. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.76 percent. On Monday, stock markets around the world got some relief  after Washington and Beijing agreed to temporarily end their trade war during talks at the G20 summit in Argentina. Upon closer scrutiny, investors said a deal between the world’s two biggest economies was far from a sure bet. “As soon as investors digested the information from the discussions they focused on the uncertainties and lack of details,” said Ryan Nauman, market strategist, Informa Financial Intelligence, Zephyr Cove, Nevada.  There was added confusion over when the 90-day truce period, during which the United States and China would hold off on imposing more tariffs, would start. Additionally, U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned he would revert to tariffs if the two sides could not resolve their differences.  “If it is, we will get it done,” Trump wrote in a Twitter post. “But if not remember, I am a Tariff Man.” Meanwhile, the flattening U.S. yield curve weighed on investors’ minds.  “The focus is now shifting to the inverted U.S. bond yield curve, which has negative connotations, while implying the U.S. economy is heading towards what was, only a few weeks ago, an improbable economic slowdown,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for APAC at Oanda.  Comments on Tuesday by New York Fed President John Williams about the path of interest rate hikes added to the uncertainty for investors.  Williams said the U.S. central bank should expect to continue raising interest rates “over the next year or so” even while it pays close attention to possible risks highlighted by financial markets. The comments came after those from Fed chair Jerome Powell last week, which lifted stocks as they were interpreted as suggesting a less aggressive path of rate hikes.  The dollar, which started the week on a weak footing as the apparent thaw in trade tensions between the U.S. and China cooled demand for the safe-haven currency, extended its fall as investors worried about the inversion of the short end of the U.S. yield curve in bond markets.  Sterling briefly drooped to a 17-month low on the day, before recovering ground to trade little-changed, in a volatile session dominated by Brexit-related headlines. Oil prices pared some gains as fears flared that demand would stall due to a trade war between the U.S. and China, and that Russia remained a stumbling block to a deal to cut global crude supply.

2018-12-04,"PARIS (Reuters) - France’s prime minister on Tuesday suspended planned increases to fuel taxes for at least six months in response to weeks of sometimes violent protests, the first major U-turn by President Emmanuel Macron’s administration in 18 months in office. In announcing the decision, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said anyone would have “to be deaf or blind” not to see or hear the roiling anger on the streets over a policy that Macron has defended as critical to combating climate change. “The French who have donned yellow vests want taxes to drop, and work to pay. That’s also what we want. If I didn’t manage to explain it, if the ruling majority didn’t manage to convince the French, then something must change,” said Philippe. “No tax is worth jeopardising the unity of the nation.” Along with the delay to the tax increases that were set for January, Philippe said the time would be used to discuss other measures to help the working poor and squeezed middle-class who rely on vehicles to get to work and go shopping.  Earlier officials had hinted at a possible increase to the minimum wage, but Philippe made no such commitment.  He warned citizens, however, that they could not expect better public services and lower taxes. “If the events of recent days have shown us one thing, it’s that the French want neither an increase in taxes or new taxes. If the tax-take falls then spending must fall, because we don’t want to pass our debts on to our children. And those debts are already sizeable,” he said. The measures will cost around 2 billion euros (£1.7 billion), but will be offset by corresponding spending cuts, a government source said. The so-called “yellow vest” movement, which started on Nov. 17 as a social-media protest group named for the high-visibility jackets all motorists in France carry in their cars, began with the aim of highlighting the squeeze on household spending brought about by Macron’s taxes on fuel. However, over the past three weeks the movement has evolved into a wider, broadbrush anti-Macron uprising, with many criticising the president for pursuing policies they say favour the rich and do nothing to help the poor.  Despite having no leader and sometimes unclear goals, the movement has drawn people of all ages and backgrounds and tapped into a growing malaise over Macron’s leadership. Over the past two days, ambulance drivers and students have joined in and launched their own protests. Two unions, CGT and FO, called lorry drivers to start a strike from December 9 while several Facebook pages were also urging new rounds of demonstrations for next Saturday.   After three weeks of rising frustration, there was scant indication Philippe’s measures would placate the “yellow vests”, who themselves are struggling to find a unified position.  “The French don’t want crumbs, they want a baguette,” ‘yellow vest’ spokesman Benjamin Cauchy told BFM, adding that the movement wanted a cancellation of the taxes. Another one, Christophe Chalencon, was more blunt: “We’re being taken for idiots,” he told Reuters, using a stronger expletive. The timing of the tax U-turn is uncomfortable for Macron. It comes as governments meet in Poland to try to agree measures to avert the most damaging consequences of global warming, an issue Macron has made a central part of his agenda. His carbon taxes were designed to address the issue.  But the scale of the protests against his policies made it almost impossible to plough ahead.  While the “yellow vest” movement was mostly peaceful to begin with, the past two weekends have seen outpourings of violence and rioting in Paris, with extreme far-right and far-left factions joining the demos.    On Saturday, the Arc de Triomphe national monument was defaced and avenues off the Champs Elysees were damaged. Cars, buildings and some cafes were torched. The unrest is estimated to have cost the economy millions, with large-scale disruption to retailers, wholesalers, the restaurant and hotel trades. In some areas, manufacturing has been hit in the run up to Christmas. Macron, a 40-year-old former investment banker and economy minister, came to office in mid-2017 promising to overhaul the economy, revitalise growth and draw foreign investment by making the nation a more attractive place to do business.  In the process he earned the tag “president of the rich” for seeming to do more to court big business and ease the tax burden on the wealthy. Discontent has steadily risen among blue-collar workers and others who feel he represents an urban “elite”. For Macron, who is sharply down in the polls and struggling to regain the initiative, a further risk is how opposition parties leverage the anger and the decision to shift course. Ahead of European Parliament elections next May, support for the far-right under Marine Le Pen and the far-left of Jean-Luc Melenchon has been rising. Macron has cast those elections as a battle between his “progressive” ideas and what he sees as their promotion of nationalist or anti-EU agendas. Le Pen was quick to point out that the six-month postponement of the fuel-tax increases took the decision beyond the European elections.

2018-12-04,"(Adds Perry quote, background on OPEC meeting) By Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said on Tuesday he would soon visit Qatar and Saudi Arabia, a trip expected to occur after this week’s meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. “I’m headed to the Middle East later here to Qatar and then to the kingdom,” Perry told the annual meeting of the National Petroleum Council, a group of more than 200 company executives and analysts that advises the Department of Energy. Perry said he would make the trip during “interesting times,” but did not give specific dates. It will be his first trip to Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, since the killing of columnist Jamal Khashoggi in October in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Top U.S. senators said on Tuesday they were more certain than ever after receiving a CIA briefing that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was culpable in Khashoggi’s killing. Saudi Arabia has said the prince had no prior knowledge of the killing, which has strained Saudi Arabia’s ties with the West. Qatar said this week it would leave OPEC to focus on gas production, in a swipe at Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the group, which is trying to show unity in tackling an oil price slide. Energy Department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said Perry would “engage with his energy counterparts in the region.” Perry and Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih are alumni of Texas A&M University and longtime friends. President Donald Trump, who has stood by the crown prince, has urged Saudi Arabia to keep oil output high after Washington left an international agreement on Iran’s nuclear program in May. The Trump administration reapplied sanctions on Iran’s oil exports in November, which led some analysts to worry crude prices would rise. But global economic weakness and fears of an oil glut as U.S. production rises have pushed crude oil prices down in recent weeks. OPEC and its allies are working toward a deal this week to reduce oil output by at least 1.3 million barrels per day. Russia, which has worked with OPEC recently on production agreements, has been the main stumbling block to a deal on a major cut. OPEC will meet on Thursday in Vienna, followed by talks with allies such as Russia on Friday.

The drop in hydraulic fracturing activity this year has been “significantly larger” than expected, Patrick Schorn, executive vice president of wells at Schlumberger, said at a conference in New York, leading to a bigger decline in pricing than the company had forecast originally.  Oilfield service companies this year have been hit by a slowdown in demand as regional oil prices have fallen with transportation bottlenecks faced by producer customers. A recent drop in the U.S. benchmark crude to around $53 a barrel also has stoked concern of an oil glut next year. Schlumberger is “guiding consensus lower” through the first quarter of 2019, analysts for investment firm Raymond James wrote in a note  following Schorn’s presentation. Shares of Schlumberger were down about 2.6 percent in afternoon trading on Tuesday, at $44.62, amid a broad market decline. The stock is down roughly 44 percent since January.  Hydraulic fracturing pumps water and sand at high pressure into a well to release oil and gas trapped in shale rock. Oil producers have been pulling back on fracking and completing wells because of the pipeline bottlenecks and price weakness.  Schorn said recent price declines would likely prompt its customers to take “a more conservative” approach during the start of 2019 and that any ramp-up in international investment also could be tepid.  “Looking forward to next year, the recent volatility in oil prices has introduced more uncertainty to the outlook” for exploration and production spending in 2019, Schorn said.  Schlumberger’s North America revenue, including its Cameron International business, was $3.12 billion in the third quarter, accounting for roughly 38 percent of total revenue.  A year ago Schlumberger acquired Weatherford International’s U.S. pressure pumping business for $430 million, positioning it to better compete with rival Halliburton. Both companies have seen shares fall sharply this year amid the slowdown in hydraulic fracturing demand.

2018-12-04,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani made an apparent threat on Tuesday to disrupt other countries’ oil shipments through the Gulf if Washington presses ahead with efforts to halt Iranian oil exports. The United States has imposed sanctions on Iran and U.S. officials say they aim to reduce Iran’s oil exports to zero in a bid to curb the Islamic Republic’s missile program and regional influence. “America should know that we are selling our oil and will continue to sell our oil and they are not able to stop our oil exports,” Rouhani said in a televised speech during a trip to the northern Iranian city of Shahroud. “If one day they want to prevent the export of Iran’s oil, then no oil will be exported from the Persian Gulf,” he said. Rouhani made similar comments in July. Also in July, an Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander, Ismail Kowsari, was quoted as saying that Tehran would block oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz lf the United States banned Iranian oil sales. Tensions have risen between Iran and the United States after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from a multilateral nuclear deal in May and reimposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Rouhani said the United States would not succeed in cutting Iran’s economic ties with the region and the world. “The most hostile group in America, with relation to Iran, has taken power,” Rouhani said, according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA). “Of course they never had a friendship with the people of Iran and we never trusted America or others 100 percent.” Earlier, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif denied a Reuters report that said a European mechanism to set up an account to trade with Iran and beat the newly reimposed U.S. sanctions may not cover oil sales, the Iranian foreign ministry website reported. “Based on the information we have, it’s not so. Because if Iran’s oil money is not deposited into the account, it’s not clear that there would be any funds for trade, because oil is a major part of Iran’s exports,” Zarif said, according to the website. “This appears to be propaganda aimed at discouraging people,” Zarif added. France and Germany are to take joint responsibility for the EU-Iran trade mechanism, Reuters reported. But the agency quoted diplomats as saying that, with U.S. threats of retribution for sanctions-busting unrelenting, the goals of the nascent trade mechanism could be scaled back to encompass only less sensitive items such as humanitarian and food products.   Iranian Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri said on Tuesday that U.S. sanctions were hitting vulnerable people in Iran. “When (Americans) say their target is the Iranian government and there won’t be pressure on the sick, the elderly and the weak in society, it’s a lie,” Jahangiri said, according to IRNA.

2018-12-04,"* France freezes power prices in response to protests * State Council would likely overrule tariff freeze (Adds detail, analyst comment) By Benjamin Mallet and Geert De Clercq PARIS, Dec 4 (Reuters) - French independent power vendors association ANODE is considering making a legal challenge to a government freeze on state-owned EDF’s electricity prices, it said on Tuesday. The government on Tuesday suspended increases to fuel taxes for at least six months in response to weeks of sometimes violent public protests and said it would keep gas and power prices unchanged this winter. ANODE president Fabien Chone said the proposed freeze on EDF’s regulated tariffs threatens the survival of some of its members. These operators all compete against EDF, which has an 80 percent share of the retail power market. The government should lower power taxes or introduce support measures for ANODE’s members, it said. “Failing that ... we may have to initiate a legal challenge,” Chone told Reuters. ANODE includes Direct Energie, Engie, Italy’s Eni and dozens of smaller operators. Government attempts to freeze power prices have been challenged systematically by ANODE in recent years and cancelled by the State Council, France’s highest administrative court, with consumers forced to pay catch-up fees retroactively. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said that from Dec. 15 to March 1 the government would organise a nationwide debate on energy and that power and gas prices would not increase in the meantime. Retail services specialist Colombus Consulting expects French power prices to rise by between 2 percent and 8 percent next year. Even at 5 percent, it would be the highest increase in years. Energy regulator CRE has said it would make a proposal to the government in February with a view to introducing new tariffs in early 2019. The government would then have three months to validate the CRE proposal, which means it could postpone a decision until after the May 26 European Parliament elections. Many French governments have postponed tariff increases to protect consumers and their own approval ratings, but legally the government has no authority to set prices. “The tariffs freeze allows the government to buy time, but they know they will be overruled and it will come back at them like a boomerang,” said Colombus Consulting’s Nicolas Goldberg. Unlike power prices, which typically move once a year, gas prices move every month.

2018-12-04,"* MSCI all world index eases 0.9 percent * European share markets continue selloff * Confusion over timing of trade truce, China commitments * U.S. yield curve inversion raises recession concerns * Dollar weakens, sterling bounces (Updates with open of U.S. markets) By Laila Kearney New York, Dec 4 (Reuters) - A key gauge of world equity markets fell on Tuesday as hopes faded for a speedy resolution to the U.S.-China trade spat, while a flattening Treasury yield curve sparked recession warning signs that weighed on the U.S. dollar. Two-year Treasury yields rose above those of longer-dated 5-year notes overnight for the first time since the start of the financial crisis in January 2008, signalling to some investors an approaching U.S. economic slowdown. MSCI’s gauge of stock markets across the globe shed 0.90 percent, while the pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.76 percent. Bond market jitters added to a weak start on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 255.16 points, or 0.99 percent, to 25,571.27, the S&P 500 lost 29.41 points, or 1.05 percent, to 2,760.96 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 94.53 points, or 1.27 percent, to 7,346.98. On Monday, stock markets around the world got some relief after Washington and Beijing agreed to temporarily end their trade war during talks at the G20 summit in Argentina. Upon closer scrutiny, investors said a deal between the world’s two biggest economies was far from a sure bet. “It isn’t very clear on what both sides agreed to, other than just a temporary truce,” Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida said. There was added confusion over when the 90-day truce period, during which the U.S. and China would hold off on imposing more tariffs, would start. Additionally, none of the commitments that U.S. officials said had been given by China - including reducing its 40 percent tariffs on autos - were agreed to in writing and specifics had yet to be hammered out. Meanwhile, the flattening U.S. yield curve weighed on investors’ minds. “The focus is now shifting to the inverted U.S. bond yield curve, which has negative connotations, while implying the U.S. economy is heading towards what was, only a few weeks ago, an improbable economic slowdown,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for APAC at Oanda. The spread between two-year and three-year yields was -0.10 basis point in morning trading, marking the first yield inversion between these two maturities since January 2008, according to Tradeweb and Refinitiv data. The U.S. dollar sagged as Treasury yields fell, adding to concerns the Federal Reserve could pause in its rate-hike cycle. The greenback, which started the week on a weak footing as the apparent thaw in trade tensions between the U.S. and China cooled demand for the safe-haven currency, extended its fall as investors worried about the inversion of the short end of the U.S. yield curve in bond markets. The dollar index, tracking the unit against six major world currencies, fell 0.12 percent, with the euro down 0.08 percent to $1.1343. The dollar fell half a percent against the offshore yuan to 6.8441, its weakest since September. Sterling rose after a senior European Union legal adviser said Britain could unilaterally withdraw its Brexit notice, easing investors concerns about Britain crashing out of the bloc in March without a deal. Oil prices surged, extending gains ahead of expected output cuts by producer cartel OPEC and a reduction in Canadian supply. Brent crude oil jumped by $1.89, or 3 percent, to a high of $63.58 before slipping back to trade around $62.25, up 56 cents by 1425 GMT. U.S. light crude was last up 20 cents at $53.15 after earlier gaining more than 3 percent to an intraday high of $54.55 a barrel. Additional reporting by Karin Strohecker, Shreyashi Sanyal,

2018-12-04,"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - When winter arrives in the Western Balkans, it is not unusual for dense smog to envelop its cities, making it hard to breathe and impairing visibility. But this year, pollution levels are among the highest in the world and public anger is on the rise.   In recent days, the Bosnian, Macedonian and Kosovar capitals topped the charts of the world’s most polluted cities as the smog intensified due to heavy traffic, excessive use of coal, poor spatial planning and solid fuel based heating. The air quality index measured by the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo hit 383 on Tuesday, a level identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as hazardous to health and almost ten times the average. In Pristina, the index registered 415 on Monday night and marked air quality in several Macedonian towns as very poor. “This is all the result of a situation in which political elites treat the city as a construction plot which should be occupied at all costs rather than a place where people live,” Anes Podic of Sarajevo’s Eko Akcija environmental group said. “You can feel how bad the air smells even inside the car or home,” said a taxi driver Mirsad Pobric. According to the WHO, pollution costs Bosnia the equivalent of more than a fifth of its annual gross domestic product (GDP) every year - around $3.9 billion - in lost work and school days, healthcare and fuel costs. Macedonia loses an equivalent of 3.2 percent of GDP a year to pollution, the World Bank said in a report, more than  $360 million a year.    As a way of bringing more attention to the issue, the Embassy of Sweden has been using red lighting on its facade in central Sarajevo to reflect air quality each day. The deeper the red, the worse the pollution. According to the WHO, 230 Bosnians die of air pollution per 100,000 citizens a year, compared to 0.4 in Sweden. The World Bank estimates that in Macedonia there are 1,350 deaths related to air pollution per year. “Pollution is killing people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, therefore something really needs to be done,” Swedish Ambassador Anders Hagelberg told Reuters. As part of efforts to combat the issue, Sweden has launched a four-year project in Bosnia that will bring together experts from its Environmental Protection Agency and local hydro-meteorological agencies and governments. The aim of the program is to help improve air quality monitoring but also to bring more investment into energy efficiency. Macedonia has launched its own program to combat air pollution to which the government allocated 1.6 million euros ($1.83 million) in next year’s budget. It aims to halve Skopje’s air pollution within two years by reducing taxes for central heating, restricting traffic and introducing stricter control of industrial emissions.  Activists say the funds allocated are insufficient and that the government’s response is inadequate.

2018-12-04,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - The El Nino weather phenomenon could reduce rainfall in Colombia by 80 percent in the first quarter of 2019, the country’s environment minister said on Tuesday, causing water shortages and forest fires. El Nino is a warming of ocean surface temperatures in the Pacific. In Colombia it is associated with crop damage and flash floods, while in other countries it can cause intense rain.  The South American country, where the majority of electricity is generated with hydropower, suffered nearly a year of drought conditions between 2015 and 2016 which almost led to energy rationing. “El Nino is maturing and in its maturity is impacting 90 percent of the country,” Environment Minister Ricardo Lozano told journalists.  The government is working to prevent forest fires and avoid further deforestation in Colombia’s Amazon region, he said, adding that low rainfall may extend beyond the first quarter. He called on residents to save water to avoid potential rationing. El Nino can also negatively affect coffee and banana crops. Colombia is the world’s top grower of washed arabica coffee. Drought also generally causes an increase in food prices, with the potential to stoke short-term inflation.

2018-12-04,"* Exxon Mobil is a partner in Equinor-operated block * Shell operates two adjacent offshore blocks * Tanzania previously estimated LNG project cost at $30 bln (Adds Shell comment) By Nerijus Adomaitis OSLO, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Norway’s Equinor is ready to start talks with Tanzania on developing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project based on a deepwater offshore discovery, the company said on Tuesday. Tanzanian President John Magufuli has asked his government to proceed with negotiations to set out the commercial and fiscal framework for the LNG project, Equinor, a majority state-owned energy company formerly known as Statoil, said. “Equinor will now proceed with our partner ExxonMobil with negotiations for a host government agreement,” an Equinor spokesman said in an email to Reuters. He said it was too early to say how long talks with the government could take and how much the project would cost. Tanzania said in 2014 that a planned LNG export plant could cost up to $30 billion. Royal Dutch Shell, which operates deepwater Blocks 1 and 4, adjacent to Equinor’s Block 2, previously sought to develop the LNG project in partnership with Equinor and Exxon Mobil. “Shell continues to work with the government of Tanzania to establish the most cost effective and competitive solution for the LNG project in Tanzania,” a company spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters. “We believe the government is best placed to lead the right way forward to deliver the project,” she added. Shell declined to say whether it would join Equinor and Exxon Mobil or would pursue separate talks with the government. Shell said on its website the three blocks had sufficient gas reserves to build an onshore LNG plant, but the company was not immediately available to comment on whether it would join the other two in starting talks. Shell estimates its two blocks hold about 16 trillion cubic feet (453 billion cubic metres) of recoverable gas, similar to the volumes in Equinor’s Block 2. Reuters reported in June that Exxon Mobil was seeking to sell its 25 percent stake in Block 2 as it was focusing on an even bigger project in neighbouring Mozambique.

2018-12-04,"(Reuters) - Earlier this year, the chief financial officer of global insurance giant Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (AJG.N) explained to analysts how the company had turned a little-known U.S. energy subsidy into a profit machine, worth hundreds of millions of dollars to its bottom line. The money came from the U.S. “clean coal” tax credit, a provision of the American Jobs Act of 2004 meant to encourage the use of chemically treated coal to cut pollution in the nation’s power plants.  To capitalise on the subsidy, A.J. Gallagher arranged investor partnerships to produce vast quantities of refined coal, as the fuel is known in the industry, for utilities across the nation, splitting the benefit of the lucrative government incentive – now worth more than $7 (5.47 pounds) per ton. “Our return on investment is staggering,” CFO Douglas Howell told analysts in the March 14 call. “Oh, 200 percent, 300 percent, 400 percent, 500 percent. I mean, just because it costs so little to develop” clean coal facilities. A.J. Gallagher’s experience reflects a truth about the U.S. refined coal tax credit, a subsidy that now costs taxpayers about $1 billion a year: While coal mining firms, utility companies and power consumers can benefit indirectly from the subsidy, the big winners are a diverse group of investors – ranging from Wall Street’s most powerful banks to insurers, meat packers and drug makers – who identified the incentive as an easy way to make money. Over the past decade, these companies have financed the construction of facilities to produce refined coal, which are situated next to coal-fired power plants and typically cost about $4 million to $6 million each to develop. They then sell the resulting coal to utilities below cost, but make eye-popping returns from the subsidy rather than the underlying business, according to regulatory documents and interviews. A.J. Gallagher’s Howell took credit for designing a business model to maximize profits from the subsidy in his March call with analysts. “It is our machine,” he said. “We developed it. We pioneered it.” The company has accumulated about $850 million worth of tax credits, mostly from its side business in taxpayer-supported refined coal, Howell said on an Oct. 25th conference call with investors and analysts. “And at current production levels” of refined coal, he said, “that may total another $700 million through 2021.” Howell declined to comment for this story. A.J. Gallagher spokeswoman Linda Collins minimized the importance of clean coal to the company. “Refined coal is not a part of our core brokerage and risk management business,” Collins said in an email. Refined coal activities, however, accounted for 25 percent of the company’s $5.28 billion in total revenue during the first nine months of this year, according to AJ Gallagher financial statements. They also made up about a fifth of the company’s $516 million in net earnings attributable to controlling interests during that period. While the subsidy has proven a boon for investors, it has often failed to achieve the intended reductions of nitrogen oxides, or NOx, the primary contributor to smog and acid rain. Utilities that burn refined coal have trailed competitors burning raw coal in lowering NOx emissions, and 22 of 56 plants burning refined coal have seen NOx emission rates rise instead of fall, according to a Reuters analysis of EPA emissions data vetted by industry experts. The refined coal tax subsidy is scheduled to expire in 2021. But lawmakers, including Republican Senator John Hoeven of coal-producing North Dakota, have introduced legislation to extend it another 10 years. They argue it helps the environment, extends the life of the ailing coal industry – a centrepiece of the Trump administration’s energy policy – and reduces power prices by giving utilities a cheap, subsidized source of coal. “This is really an incentive to operate in a way that’s more environmentally friendly while keeping power costs low,” said Hoeven, whose state sits atop an 800-year supply of lignite coal. If the extension goes through, those best placed to gain from the subsidy are an eclectic list of refined coal investors, including Wall Street banks Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co Inc (JPM.N) and Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N); wealth management giant Fidelity Investments; drugmaker Mylan NV MYL.N; U.S. affiliates of global commodities trader Noble Group Ltd (NOBG.SI); industrial supplier W.W. Grainger Inc (GWW.N); Kansas-based pork producer Seaboard Corp (SEB.N); and ethanol plant investor Rex American Resources Corp (REX.N), according to disclosures with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, state environmental regulators and the U.S. Tax Court. CapitalOne, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Mylan, Noble, Rex American, Seaboard and W.W. Grainger declined to comment on refined coal’s impact on NOx pollution. These and other refined coal investors stand to gain at least $10 billion in tax incentives over the next decade if the law is extended, based on the current annual consumption of refined coal and the existing level of the inflation-adjusted tax credit. As originally drawn in 2004, the refined coal tax credit required producers to increase raw coal’s market value by 50 percent to qualify for the subsidy. The market-value clause made cost-conscious utilities unwilling to buy the specialized product. Prospects for the clean coal business were dim. But in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, two U.S. senators changed the landscape by deleting the market-value clause – a subtle tweak tucked away in the massive $700 billion U.S. financial rescue package. A.J. Gallagher, along with utility firms Ameren Corp and DTE Energy, also had been lobbying on the issue of refined coal, according to lobbying disclosure filings, though it is unclear if they lobbied specifically on the market-value clause. Officials at Ameren and DTE declined to comment on the lobbying. The policy edit – by Democrat Max Baucus of coal mining state Montana and Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa – made it possible for refined coal producers to receive the subsidy even if they sold their product to utilities below cost. That paved the way for investors to set up operations and to ultimately make billions of dollars building refined coal to its current share of about a fifth of the U.S. coal market. Baucus said he does not remember the change to the refined coal tax credit. “It was a tax-credit blizzard; a deluge of credits was being discussed,” Baucus said. “It’s very easy to change the code to give credit to companies to spur investment. The code gets crusted with barnacles of credits, and then they’re removed. It’s the natural ebb and flow of things.” Grassley declined to comment for this story. The subsidy is now worth more than $7 a ton, an amount that covers losses on the discounted pricing and the operations that produce refined coal, while often leaving a profit that can amount to tens or hundreds of millions of dollars per year per investor, according to disclosures by tax credit investors. Because some of the operating expenses of running a refined coal facility are deductible, the tax credit’s effective value can top $9 a ton. Goldman Sachs, one of the world’s most powerful banks, is currently generating estimated annual gross tax credits of about $50 million from two Missouri power plants alone, according data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showing refined coal consumption patterns at the plants. Goldman declined to comment. “It was virtually impossible to make money producing clean coal for utilities,” said Roger Jones, senior counsel at McDermott Will & Emery LLP in Chicago, who has represented refined coal tax investors. “But as soon as the credit was there, people thought about capital-raising to engage in this activity.” After the tax credit was revised, A.J. Gallagher led the race to build refined coal facilities, constructing them next to power plants that burned the most coal in the country so as to maximize credit volumes. It now has investments in 34 refined coal facilities in the United States, along with a 46.5 percent controlling stake in Chem-Mod LLC, a leading supplier of chemicals used to refine raw coal, according to A.J. Gallagher SEC filings. Gallagher’s main rival, Colorado-based Advanced Emissions Solutions Inc (ADES.O), holds interests in 19 refined coal facilities with tax credit investors, through a joint venture with Goldman Sachs and NexGen Resources Corp. Affiliates of Goldman Sachs account for most of those investors, SEC filings show. Goldman Sachs, in 2011, purchased a 15 percent stake in the joint venture, a refined coal operator called Tinuum Group LLC, formerly known as Clean Coal Solutions, for $60 million. Advanced Emissions owns a 42.5 percent stake in Tinuum, whose operations produced and sold about 60 million tons of refined coal during the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, SEC disclosures show. Some partnerships include players even farther afield from the energy business. In one of refined coal’s earliest and biggest financial commitments, trash collector Waste Management Inc (WM.N) teamed up with JPMorgan Chase to invest in the refined coal facility at Coal Creek Station in North Dakota. The bank and the trash company invested in a facility that treats coal by preheating it in a process that dries out several million tons of soggy lignite coal each year, increasing its energy output. Electric cooperative Great River Energy, the owner of the plant, agreed to lease its refined coal facility to JPMorgan and Waste Management for $530 million over 16 years, according to a January 2011 deal disclosed by the co-op. JPMorgan and Waste Management declined to comment for this story. Another big beneficiary is drug maker Mylan. Refined coal tax credits were the second biggest component in producing a tax benefit of $358.3 million in 2016, according to Mylan’s annual report. That tax benefit lifted its consolidated earnings for the year to $480 million, from $121.7 million. Power plant owners typically sell their coal at cost to refined coal operations controlled by tax credit investors. Once the coal is treated with chemicals or dried out at an on-site refined coal facility, the tax credit investors sell the coal back to the power plants at a discount that can be anywhere from 75 cents to $2 per ton – a way to ensure utilities get some benefit from the subsidy, according to agreements filed with state regulators. Central-Appalachian coal, which has high energy content for power generation, costs about $75 a ton. Coal plant owners also may structure deals with refined coal producers to collect coal-handling and licensing fees or to charge rent through leases of their land used for the facilities, the disclosures show. Last year, Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities, a unit of PPL Corp (PPL.N), struck a deal with an affiliate of Goldman Sachs to burn refined coal at the utility’s Ghent power station. The utility stands to receive $10 million a year in incentives and would bear no expense for running the refined coal operations, according to disclosures with Kentucky regulators. For Goldman and any other tax credit investors in the deal, the gross annual tax credit, before refined coal operating expenses and incentives for the utility, is $39 million, Reuters estimates. That estimate is based on Ghent’s average annual coal consumption of 5.5 million tons multiplied by the $7.03 per ton tax credit. Goldman declined to comment on the revenue or profit it derives from clean-coal tax credits. Utility companies themselves haven’t been in the vanguard of capitalizing on the refined coal subsidy. That’s because the original wording of the refined coal tax credit, passed in 2004, stipulated that the producer of refined coal had to sell it to an “unrelated person.” So, utilities couldn’t invest in clean coal and sell it to themselves. The IRS issued new guidance in 2009, however, that opened the door for affiliates of utilities like Detroit-based DTE Energy to control or take stakes in refined coal production facilities in recent years. DTE has received some $639 million in refined coal tax credits since 2012, SEC disclosures show. DTE declined to comment for this story. In today’s thriving clean coal industry, A.J. Gallagher’s early moves to monetize the tax credit seem prescient. Months before the subsidy first entered the tax code in 2004, the company paid $300,000 for a 5 percent ownership stake in Chem-Mod, which at the time was developing chemical treatments designed to reduce coal pollution. A core group of five people at A.J. Gallagher was overseeing the move into the business, according to the company’s disclosures to investors. A.J. Gallagher was among several investors who paid Washington firms to lobby on refined coal, according to lobbying disclosure filings. In 2008, before Congress modified the refined coal tax credit to erase the market-value clause, the company paid two law firms – Winston & Strawn, and Steptoe & Johnson – to lobby on “refined coal” and “energy and tax” issues, respectively. The lobbying disclosure documents do not detail what specific objective the companies had in their lobbying activities. Officials from those law firms involved in the lobbying declined to comment. David Lowman, a partner at Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP, was lobbying on refined coal on behalf of a different company at the time. He said the refined coal industry successfully pushed to have the market value clause eliminated. In return, the industry agreed to double the pollution reduction requirement on mercury and sulphur dioxide to 40 percent from 20 percent. By the end of 2008, Gallagher had built up a 42 percent stake in Chem-Mod for a total investment of $13.3 million, according to company disclosures. Now it was ready to launch into developing facilities. The dive into a newly subsidized business was part of the company’s strategy to find profits in taxpayer-financed incentives. Dating to the 1980s, Arthur J. Gallagher has sought out opportunities, for example, in subsidized low-income housing and the so-called synfuel tax credit, designed to promote domestically-produced synthetic fuels that can reduce U.S. import dependence. Gallagher’s approach to refined coal, however, has made it a heavyweight, and it has been pivotal in recruiting tax investors to help finance refined coal operations throughout the country. In 2009, it negotiated partnerships with Fidelity and the U.S. subsidiary of France’s Schneider Electric SE (SCHN.PA) to produce refined coal for a utility at three South Carolina power plants, U.S. Tax Court disclosures show. Gallagher also has struck deals to put refined coal operations inside the fence of power plants owned by DTE and St. Louis-based utility Ameren Corp (AEE.N). Net earnings from its “clean energy” investments are estimated to be $115 million in 2018, or 17 times more than what the company reported in 2010. Looking ahead, the company can carry forward its stockpile of $850 million in credits to reduce its taxes in future years.  “We will not be paying much, if any, U.S. federal income tax for many years to come,” CFO Howell said this spring during a conference call with investors.

2018-12-04,"JAKARTA, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Energy company Eni aims to start output of natural gas from its offshore Merakes project in Indonesia in 2021, the country’s deputy energy minister said on Tuesday. Initial production at Merakes would be 155 million cubic feet of natural gas per day (mmcfd), rising to a forecast peak output of 391 mmcfd, deputy minister Arcandra Tahar said. A spokesman for Italy’s Eni did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter. The targets are part of an amended development plan for the East Sepinggan block in the Makassar Strait under a new production sharing contract that is expected to be completed before Dec. 12, he said. As part of the revision, the contractors have agreed to adopt a gross split scheme, whereby Eni and its partner Pertamina would take 67 percent of crude oil and 72 percent of natural gas production from the project, and the Indonesian government would take the rest. It was not immediately clear what split was set previously. Eni said in April it had obtained approval for plans to pipe natural gas from Merakes to the Bontang liquefied natural gas (LNG) processing facility in East Kalimantan. The amendment would be first time a conventional cost-recovery production-sharing contract in Indonesia is converted to use the gross split scheme, Tahar said. “By using the gross split scheme, it will be simpler and they don’t need a lengthy tender process, so they see it as an opportunity,” Tahar said, referring to Eni’s proposal to make the switch, which he said had been received two weeks ago. Indonesia recently adjusted its gross split mechanism for new and expiring oil and gas production sharing contracts, whereby contractors shoulder the cost of exploration and production, rather than being reimbursed by the government. The changes were intended to attract investment amid tepid interest in Indonesia’s energy tenders and after the industry pointed to more attractive opportunities in other countries. Tahar said the Merakes project has an estimated 814 billion cubic feet of natural gas reserves and an economic lifetime of around nine years. Eni holds an 85 percent participating interest in the contract via its local unit Eni East Sepinggan Limited, while Indonesia’s Pertamina has 15 percent. With the revision, the contract duration up to July 19, 2042, will not change, Tahar said.

2018-12-04,"* MSCI all world index ease 0.1 percent * European share markets continue selloff * Confusion over timing of trade truce, China’s commitments * U.S. yield curve inversion raises recession concerns * Dollar weakens, sterling bounces (Updates with European open, comment) By Karin Strohecker London, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Deflating hopes of a swift resolution to the Sino-U.S. trade war knocked world stocks off three-week highs on Tuesday, while growing fears the U.S economy could be headed for recession sooner than expected weighed on the dollar. The rapprochement between U.S. President Donald Trump and China’s Xi Jinping at the weekend G20 meeting had fired up markets on Monday. But the upbeat mood quickly dissipated on scepticism that Washington and Beijing can resolve deep-seated differences on trade in the agreed three-month negotiating window. Adding to market woes, was an inversion of the short end of the U.S. yield curve which raised the spectre of a possible U.S. recession. Following declines on Asian bourses, where Japan’s Nikkei stock index closed 2.4 percent lower, the mood was sombre in Europe with the wider blue chip index slipping 0.3 percent. Frankfurt’s DAX and Paris’ CAC 40 fell 0.6 percent while MSCI’s index of world stocks declined 0.1 percent. “The initial relief rally was never going to last. Investors need more detail now in order for that risk on sentiment to survive,” said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group. “So far that detail has not been coming through and investors have more questions than answers.” There was confusion over when the 90-day period, during which the U.S. and China would hold off on imposing more tariffs, would start. A White House official said it started on Dec. 1, while earlier, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters it would start on Jan. 1. Moreover, none of the commitments that U.S. officials said had been given by China - including reducing its 40 percent tariffs on autos - were agreed to in writing and specifics had yet to be hammered out. Meanwhile the U.S. yield curve focussed investors’ minds. The curve between U.S. three-year and five-year and between two-year and five-year paper inverted on Monday - the first parts of the Treasury yield curve to invert since the financial crisis, excluding very short-dated debt. Analysts expect the two-year, 10-year yield curve - seen as a predictor of a U.S. recession - to follow suit. On Tuesday, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 2.95 percent compared with its U.S. Monday close of 2.99 percent. And the spread between 10-year and two-year Treasury yields tightened to around 13 basis points - hitting its narrowest level since July 2007. “The focus is now shifting to the inverted U.S. bond yield curve which has negative connotations, while implying the U.S. economy is heading towards what was only a few weeks ago an improbable economic slowdown,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for APAC at Oanda. “Now, even recessionary fear is starting to raise its ugly head.” However, analysts said U.S. manufacturing data released on Monday pointed to a stronger economic outlook, with new orders a “key driver” in boosting activity. Meanwhile oil prices extended gains, adding to Monday’s 4 percent surge as investors bet a key OPEC meeting on Thursday could deliver supply cuts. U.S. crude and Brent crude added 1.6 percent to $53.82 and $62.7 per barrel respectively. The dollar weakened against major currencies, weighed down by falling U.S. bond yields. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of peers, softened 0.5 percent to 96.53, while the euro added 0.6 percent to $1.1416. The dollar also weakened 0.8 percent against the Japanese yen and fell more than 0.5 percent to its weakest level since September against the offshore Chinese yuan to 6.83 yuan. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was scheduled to testify on Wednesday to a congressional Joint Economic Committee, but the hearing was postponed because of a national day of mourning for U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who died on Friday. The dollar came under pressure last week on Powell’s comments that rates were nearing neutral levels, which markets widely interpreted as signalling a slowdown in the Fed’s rate-hike cycle. Meanwhile sterling was back on the Brexit rollercoaster, rallying sharply after the EU’s top legal adviser said Britain had the right to withdraw its Brexit notice. This was a bounce back from two-month lows it hit in early trade against the dollar on concern about British parliamentary approval for a proposed Brexit deal. The pound last stood 0.7 percent firmer at $1.2814 while weakening 0.2 percent against the euro to 89.10 pence. Spot gold jumped on the weaker dollar, trading up 0.5 percent at $1,237.24 per ounce.

2018-12-04,"VIENNA, Dec 4 (Reuters) - OPEC and its allies are working towards a deal to reduce oil output by at least 1.3 million barrels per day, four sources said, adding that Russia’s resistance to a significant production cut was so far the main stumbling block. OPEC meets on Thursday in Vienna, followed by talks with allies such as Russia on Friday, amid a drop in crude prices caused by global economic weakness and concerns about an oil glut due largely to a rise in U.S. production. The producer group’s de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, has indicated a need for steep reductions in output from January but has come under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to help support the world economy with lower oil prices. Possibly complicating any OPEC decision is the crisis around the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. Trump has backed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman despite calls from many U.S. politicians to impose stiff sanctions on Riyadh. The sources, three from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and one from a non-OPEC producer, said the meeting was taking place in a difficult environment and that Russia’s position would be key in reaching a deal. “Russia is playing tough,” one of the OPEC sources said. Russian sources have indicated the country could contribute some 140,000 bpd to a reduction, but Middle East-dominated OPEC insists Moscow cut by 250,000-300,000 bpd. Two OPEC sources said talks were focusing on a pro-rata cut of 3-3.5 percent from October output levels, with no exemptions for any member. “Until those main criteria are met, OPEC could endure a fall in oil prices for a while if it opted to delay a decision on a cut for a month or two,” one of the sources said. “OPEC can always meet again in February and decide on a cut then. Those who were not able or willing to cooperate will be wanting to cut then,” the source added. Qatar said on Monday it would quit OPEC to focus on gas in a swipe at Saudi Arabia, which is trying to show unity in tackling the slide in oil prices.

2018-12-04,"(Reuters) - Polymer maker Victrex Plc (VCTX.L) said on Tuesday it stocked up extra raw materials and secured more warehousing for finished goods in Europe and China, the latest UK company to do so to mitigate potential disruptions due to Brexit. The latest measures allow a minimum of eight weeks of finished goods stock to be held outside Britain by the end of March 2019, Victrex said. Group inventories could exceed 80 million pounds through FY 2019 as a consequence, compared with 69.3 million pounds in FY 2018, it said. The company posted a 15 percent rise in full-year profit before tax at 127.5 million pounds, but warned that if inventory levels depleted for a certain period, it may not be able to import certain raw materials or export finished goods through customs, curtailing sales. Revenue for the full year ended Sept. 30 rose 12 percent to 326 million pounds. Ninety-eight percent of Victrex’s revenue comes from outside Britain. Victrex also said it had set up an executive committee to monitor Brexit developments and direct mitigating actions.

2018-12-04,"* MSCI Asia Ex-Japan falls 0.3 pct; Nikkei drops 2.4 percent * European share markets seen continuing sell-off * Confusion over timing of trade truce, China’s commitments * U.S. yield curve inversion raises recession concerns * Weaker dollar extends yuan gains By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Tuesday as relief over a pause in escalation of the trade war between the U.S. and China gave way to doubt over the two countries’ ability to resolve differences. Adding to market worries, an inversion at the short end of the U.S. yield curve raised the spectre of a possible U.S. recession. The sell-off appeared likely to extend into European trading, with spreadbetters expecting London’s FTSE 100 to fall 0.2 percent at the open, and both Frankfurt’s DAX and Paris’ CAC 40 to fall 0.4 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.3 percent lower. Australia shares gave up 1 percent for the day and Seoul’s Kospi ended 0.8 percent lower. Japan’s Nikkei stock index tumbled, closing 2.4 percent lower on profit taking and as foreign investors and hedge funds reduced their positions on risky assets. But Chinese blue-chip shares in Shenzhen and Shanghai added 0.2 percent after struggling to break into positive territory for much of the day. The temporary freeze on further hostilities in the trade war between the United States and China had sparked a global rally in equity markets on Monday, pushing MSCI’s all-country world index up 1.3 percent. But even before the trading day ended, major U.S. indexes pulled back from intraday highs on scepticism that Washington and Beijing can resolve their deep-seated differences in the three-month negotiating window that was agreed, after which tariffs could escalate again. “It seems that more details and signs of progress will be needed if the initial trade truce warm fuzzy feeling is to be sustained,” National Australia Bank analysts said in a note to clients. Already, there was confusion over when the 90-day period would start. A White House official said it started on Dec. 1, while earlier, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters it would start on Jan. 1. Moreover, none of the commitments that U.S. officials said had been given by China, including reducing its 40 percent tariffs on autos, were agreed to in writing and specifics had yet to be hammered out. “The fear across global markets is that this is just a short term relief rally and we will find ourselves back where we were a few weeks ago and staring down the barrel of a long term global growth slow down,” Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia said in a note. Adding to worries over the outlook for the global economy, the yield curve between U.S. three-year and five-year notes, and between two-year and five-year paper inverted on Monday - the first parts of the Treasury yield curve to invert since the financial crisis, excluding very short-dated debt. Analysts expect an inversion of the two-year, 10-year yield curve - seen as a predictor of a U.S. recession - to follow suit. On Tuesday, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 2.9515 percent compared with its U.S. close of 2.991 percent on Monday. The two-year yield also fell, but by a narrower margin, touching 2.8109 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.833 percent. That put the spread between 10-year and two-year Treasuries around 14 basis points. Earlier in the day, the spread hits its narrowest level since July 2007. “The market pricing evident in the yield curve inversion from three to five segment of the curve, as well as the dip in the 10-year yield below 3 percent yesterday, goes to reinforce these concerns” about the U.S. economy potentially heading into a recession, said Prakash Sakpal, an economist at ING in Singapore. However, he added that solid U.S. manufacturing data released Monday pointed to a stronger economic outlook, with new orders a “key driver” in boosting activity. In contrast to faltering Asian equity markets, oil prices continued to rise after surging 4 percent the day before on the U.S.-China trade truce, and ahead of a key OPEC meeting expected to lead to supply cuts. U.S. crude was 1 percent higher at $53.46 per barrel, and Brent crude futures gained 0.9 percent to $62.26 a barrel. In the currency market, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of peers, softened 0.3 percent to 96.718. The dollar was 0.5 percent weaker against the yen, at 113.047, and the euro gained 0.3 percent to $1.1384. As the dollar weakened, China’s yuan continued to surge, and was trading at 6.8419 to the dollar around 0700 GMT. Since Friday, it has added more than 1,000 pips against the greenback. “The gain in the yuan is no surprise given the ceasefire and the yuan’s weakness over the course of this year as the trade tensions escalated,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research for ANZ Banking Group in Singapore. Goh said that comments from U.S. Trade Secretary Steven Mnuchin that the yuan had been discussed during dinner between the Chinese and U.S. presidents “suggests that perhaps there is an intention for the Chinese side to ensure that the currency doesn’t weaken further,” providing a further boost to the yuan. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was scheduled to testify on Wednesday to a congressional Joint Economic Committee, but the hearing was postponed because of a national day of mourning for U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who died on Friday. The dollar came under pressure last week on Powell’s comments that rates were nearing neutral levels, which markets widely interpreted as signalling a slowdown in the Fed’s rate-hike cycle. Spot gold jumped on the weaker dollar, trading up 0.5 percent at $1,237.24 per ounce. Reporting by Andrew Galbraith; Editing by Shri Navaratnam,

2018-12-04,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - The northern winter usually leads to a demand and price peak for several major commodities in Asia, but this year is bucking the trend for coal, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and iron ore. There doesn’t appear to be one single driving narrative causing the break with the usual seasonal patterns, rather a variety of unrelated, or loosely related factors are at work, but with China as a common thread. LNG provides the most stark example, with the spot Asian price actually weakening at a time when it is usually strengthening. It dropped to $9.80 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in the week to Nov. 30, the weakest since late July. Spot LNG has in the past few years exhibited a strong and reliable seasonal pattern in Asia, rising to a winter-peak before slackening into summer. The peak so far in 2018 has been in summer, when LNG reached $11.60 per mmBtu in June, above the prior winter-high of $11.50 from mid-January. LNG has been influenced by a variety of factors, with summer prices rising because of demand for cooling amid warmer-than-usual weather, and some supply issues, including an outage at Malaysia’s Bintalu project. The winter price surge hasn’t happened largely because China, the world’s second-biggest LNG importer and a major driver of winter demand, is not experiencing the same demand surge as it did last year. In 2017-18, Chinese demand for LNG soared as the country moved sharply to cut back on the use of coal for residential heating over winter amid efforts to mitigate air pollution. However, this winter China appears to have prepared more thoroughly, building up natural gas inventories and being more cautious in the amount of coal-to-gas switching being undertaken. A milder-than-usual winter so far in North Asia has also limited demand for spot cargoes from major buyers such as Japan and South Korea. In coal, the winter-peak experienced since the price recovery started in 2016 has been absent, in part because of the warmer weather, but also because of moves in China to restrict imports. The price of thermal coal at Australia’s Newcastle port, as assessed by Argus Media, was $97.94 a tonne in the week ended Nov. 30. While this was up a touch from the seven-month low of $97.50 a tonne the prior week, it’s still well below the peak of $119.74 reached in mid-July. In common with LNG, China, the world’s biggest coal importer, appears to be playing a role in keeping the polluting fuel from enjoying a winter-peak. Chinese trading companies said the authorities in Beijing have indicated that coal imports are to be wound back for December as part of efforts to keep imports for 2018 around the same level as 2017. That will be difficult as imports for the first 10 months of 2018, at 252 million tonnes, were already within spitting distance of the total of 279 million for the whole of 2017. China’s coal utilities have plentiful inventories for winter amid rising domestic production and it’s believed the authorities are prioritising the consumption of local supplies. Iron ore is another commodity that usually enjoys a strong run in the northern winter, albeit usually toward the tail end as Chinese steel mills start to re-stock ahead of the summer peak demand for steel. This year, iron ore peaked in late February, with the 62-percent grade, as assessed by Argus Media, reaching $79.90 a tonne on Feb. 26. But the steelmaking ingredient may have already reached its winter-peak, having hit $77.80 on Nov. 9, and subsequently dropping sharply to a low of $64.55 on Nov. 27. It has recovered somewhat since then to $66.45 a tonne on Monday, but that was most likely because commodities in general got a boost from news of the trade dispute ceasefire between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. Iron ore is declining in tandem with Chinese steel prices, which have been suffering because of a poorer demand outlook and still strong production. Whether iron ore can stage a late winter rally will likely be dependent on whether the market takes the view that China’s infrastructure and construction spending look positive for 2019. Overall it appears that without any deliberate policy moves, China has disrupted the normal season pattern for some of its major commodity imports. This is perhaps an important reminder that the world’s biggest buyer of natural resources can make commodities dance to its tune, even without really trying.
