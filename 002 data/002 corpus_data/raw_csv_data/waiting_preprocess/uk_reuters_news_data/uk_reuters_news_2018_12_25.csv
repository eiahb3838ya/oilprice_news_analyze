2018-12-25,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday presented a $47 billion state budget with increased spending on lower income groups, saying U.S. sanctions would affect people’s lives and economic growth but not bring the government to its knees. U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a multilateral nuclear deal with Iran in May and reimposed sanctions on it, including on its vital oil industry. “America’s goal is to bring Iran’s Islamic system to its knees... and it will fail in this, but sanctions will no doubt affect people’s lives, and the country’s development and economic growth,” Rouhani told parliament in a speech carried live on state television. He gave the value of the nominally balanced draft budget, excluding the spending of state enterprises, at about 4,700 trillion rials for the next Iranian year, which starts on March 21.  That figure is up from about 3,700 trillion rials he had proposed for this year, but the new budget is effectively worth about half of this year’s because of the weakening of Iran’s currency. Under the unofficial exchange rate used on the free market, the budget is worth about $47 billion. Rouhani said state employees and pensioners would get a 20 percent pay rise next year, and the budget included $14 billion at a subsidized rate less than half of the market to provide cheap basic goods such as food and medicine, up from $13 billion in this year’s budget. Officials have said the budget is designed to provide for the basic needs of low-income groups, including state employees and pensioners, and to support production and employment. It also seeks to relaunch thousands of stalled state projects with the help of private investors. The draft budget has to be passed by parliament and approved by a clerical body that vets legislation before it becomes law. Rouhani called for trimming the state sector and curbing the government’s dependence on oil income, which is forecast at 1,425 trillion rials in the proposed budget. Officials have said the budget calculations were based on a forecast crude price of $50-$54 per barrel and exports of 1 to 1.5 million barrels per day, down from a peak of almost 3 million bpd in mid-2018. “If the private sector was active in the country ..., and if the budget did not rely heavily on oil, the impact of sanctions would have been much less,” Rouhani said. A separate draft budget for state companies, institutions and banks allocates them a total of $127 billion. Rouhani’s speech was interrupted by parliament members, who Iranian news agencies said were mostly from the southwestern Khuzestan province and were protesting over shortages of drinking water in their region.

2018-12-25,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Many Delhi residents were forced to spend Christmas indoors this year as air quality remained at “severe to emergency” levels for a fourth day, in the Indian capital’s worst smog crisis this year. Senior officials predicted the severe pollution would last another three days due to unusually stagnant and cold air. They issued a three-day emergency response on Monday that included closing area factories and banning construction works. “We are preferring to stay at home due to pollution despite  Christmas celebrations and a public holiday,” said Amit Azad, a financial consultant. He bought an air purifier this week after developing a cough because of the smog. A Delhi government official blamed the pollution for lighter-than-usual traffic on already holiday-thinned streets,     while a Delhi airport official said some domestic and international flights were delayed for up to two hours due to poor visibility. Delhi’s air quality index, which measures the concentration of poisonous particulate matter, averaged 420 on Tuesday morning, slightly better than 449-450 the previous two days - the worst this year - data from the government’s Central Pollution Control Board showed. A reading above 100 is considered unhealthy. Delhi is ranked among the world’s worst cities in air quality, after years of breakneck growth in auto sales and coal-fired power generation. Environmentalists say the federal and city governments, while focusing on temporary responses, are side-stepping more effective, long-term measures that would hit at the sources of pollution and promote cleaner fuels. “There is a lack of political will to take required measures on a sustained basis to contain pollution levels,” said Sunil Dahiya, a senior campaigner with Greenpeace India. He called for higher car parking fees and reduced dependence on coal-fired power plants. Dahiya also said the government should immediately close down schools and urge people to curtail outdoor activities given the serious health effects of the current pollution levels.

2018-12-25,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Guyana’s government is “in discussion” with Exxon Mobil after two ships searching for oil off the South American country’s coast halted work following a weekend confrontation with Venezuela’s navy, Guyana’s foreign minister said on Monday. Both neighbouring South American countries said the Saturday incident had occurred within their territorial waters. A century-long border dispute has heated up in recent years as Irving, Texas-based Exxon has discovered more than 5 billion barrels of oil and gas off Guyana’s shores. Guyana Foreign Affairs Minister Carl Greenidge said he could not “for the moment” say whether the two ships owned by Norway’s Petroleum Geo-Services and hired by Exxon would resume their seismic survey, or if they would return to the area where the incident occurred, citing the ongoing talks with Exxon.  When asked if Guyanese authorities would provide the vessels with protection if they continue exploration, he said Guyana is “committed to resolving territorial disputes by peaceful means.”  “We will therefore first try to explore and exhaust Diplomatic channels,” Greenidge said in an emailed response to questions from Reuters. “Guyana is a small state of less than a million persons compared with Venezuela’s population of 30 million.”  Earlier on Monday, Exxon declined to say when the survey would restart, referring questions to PGS. Bard Stenberg, a PGS senior vice president, declined to comment on any resumption of the work or if the company has sought to have Guyana provide protection for its vessels.  There were two PGS ships involved in the confrontation, the Ramform Tethys and Delta Monarch, Stenberg said on Monday.  “A couple hours later we learnt that the Venezuelan navy had withdrawn from the area,” he added.  Critics of Venezuela’s socialist President Nicolas Maduro say he has rekindled tensions with its eastern neighbour over the Essequibo region, a sparsely populated area making up two-thirds of Guyana’s territory that is also claimed by Venezuela, to distract from a severe economic crisis in the OPEC-member nation.  Venezuela is home to the world’s largest crude reserves, but production is hovering near its lowest levels in 70 years due to underinvestment, hyperinflation, and mismanagement under military control of the company.  Saturday’s confrontation recalled an October 2013 incident when Venezuela’s navy seized a ship carrying out a seabed survey for Texas-based Anadarko Petroleum Corp in Guyana, accusing it of violating its maritime territory. Venezuela freed the vessel a week later.
