2018-11-03,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Friday it will temporarily allow eight importers to keep buying Iranian oil when it re-imposes sanctions on Monday to try to force Iran to curb its nuclear, missile and regional activities. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who announced the decision, did not name the eight, which he referred to as “jurisdictions,” a term that might include importers such as Taiwan which the United States does not regard as a country. Having abandoned the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, U.S. President Donald Trump is trying to cripple Iran’s oil-dependent economy and force Tehran to quash not only its nuclear ambitions and its ballistic missile programme but its support for militant proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East. On Twitter, in a message designed to emphasize his “maximum pressure” policy toward Iran, Trump included a photograph of himself modelled on a entertainment industry poster with the headline: “Sanctions are coming November 5.” China, India, South Korea, Turkey, Italy, the United Arab Emirates and Japan have been top importers of Iran’s oil, while Taiwan occasionally buys cargoes of Iranian crude but is not a major buyer. Turkey has been told it will temporarily be allowed to keep buying Iranian oil, its energy minister told reporters, as has Iraq, as long as it does not pay Iran in U.S. dollars, three Iraqi officials said. India and South Korea were also on the list, said a source familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Under U.S. law, exceptions can be granted for up to 180 days. India’s Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Saturday said India and other leading oil buyers would benefit from the U.S. waiver they have been granted. “In the current geopolitically challenging scenario, India has managed to convince international leaders,” Pradhan told reporters in New Delhi. Oil prices fell on Friday for a weekly loss of over 6 percent, as investors worried about crude oversupply after the U.S. waivers. Brent crude futures fell 6 cents to settle at $72.83 a barrel, while U.S. crude declined 55 cents to end the session at $63.14 per barrel, a 0.86 percent loss.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also said Washington had told the Brussels-based SWIFT financial messaging service it was expected to disconnect all Iranian financial institutions that the United States plans to blacklist as of Monday. He declined to name the targeted institutions. Trump set in motion the resumption of sanctions on May 8, when he announced U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 deal between Iran and world powers under which Tehran had agreed to curtail its nuclear programme in return for relief from sanctions. “This part of the campaign is aimed at depriving the regime of the revenues it uses to spread death and destruction around the world, Pompeo said. Pompeo said Washington will issue temporary waivers to the  eight Iran oil importers “only because they have demonstrated significant reductions in their crude oil and cooperation on many other fronts.”  Two would stop imports and the other six would greatly reduce them, Pompeo said. He later said the ultimate goal was to stop all Iranian crude exports. “We will ultimately move Iran to zero crude oil.  That’ll take us some number of months to do that,” Pompeo told Fox News according to the transcript of the interview released by the State Department. “We’ve been able to do that in a way that hasn’t had a huge impact on crude oil prices. That’s a good thing for American consumers.”  Iran said it was not troubled over the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions, which target not only its vital oil and gas sector but also shipping, ship-building and banking industries. “America will not be able to carry out any measure against our great and brave nation ... We have the knowledge and the capability to manage the country’s economic affairs,” Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi told state TV. However, ordinary Iranians fear an even more painful squeeze, from businesses struggling to buy raw materials to the sick and elderly unable to afford life-saving medicines. “I cannot even buy rice to feed my children or pay my rent,” said elementary school teacher Pejman Sarafnejad, 43, a father of three in Tehran. The European Union, France, Germany and Britain, parties to the nuclear agreement who are trying to keep it alive, said they regretted Washington’s decision to re-impose sanctions. The EU is creating a special mechanism that would circumvent U.S. financial sanctions on Iran. The United States is able to pressure other nations to stop buying Iranian oil under a 2012 law that allows the president to cut off foreign banks, including central banks, from the U.S. financial system unless they significantly reduce purchases. The United States believes global oil supplies will exceed demand next year, making it easier for countries to cut Iranian oil imports to zero, Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative for Iran, told reporters.

2018-11-03,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran called on Saturday for European assurances of support in the face of Washington’s intent to reimpose sanctions on vital Iranian oil sales to force Tehran to curb its nuclear, missile and regional activities. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif spoke by telephone with the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, and his counterparts from Germany, Sweden and Denmark about European measures to counter the U.S. sanctions, the Iranian state news agency IRNA reported. “Mogherini and the European ministers ... highlighted the importance of the finance ministers’ commitment to Europe’s financial mechanism to save the Iran nuclear deal and said the mechanism will be operational in the coming days,” IRNA said. Washington will reapply far-reaching sanctions on Iran’s petroleum and banking sectors starting on Monday. Diplomats told Reuters last week that the new EU mechanism to facilitate payments for Iranian exports should be legally in place by Nov. 4, when the next phase of U.S. sanctions hit, but will not be operational until early next year. The EU, France, Germany and Britain, said in a joint statement on Friday they regretted U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to restore sanctions on Iran, the world’s No. 3 oil ezporter. “Our aim is to protect European economic actors who have legitimate commercial exchanges with Iran, in line with European legislation and the United Nations’ Security Council resolution 2231,” Mogherini and the foreign ministers and finance ministers of the three countries said in their statement.  The three biggest European powers are co-signatories, along with Russia and China, to an international 2015 deal with Iran that reined in its nuclear work in exchange for the lifting of most international sanctions on Tehran.  With the sanctions clampdown, Trump is seeking to push Iran into stricter curbs on its nuclear programme and a halt to its missile development activity and support for proxy forces in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East. Trump denounced the nuclear deal, signed before he took office, as flawed in Iran’s favour and withdrew Washington from the pact in May.  Meanwhile, Iranian state television reported that the Islamci Republic had started production of the locally-designed Kowsar fighter plane for use in its air force.

2018-11-03,"DUBAI, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday the United States had failed to reassert its domination of Iran since the country’s 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the U.S.-backed Shah, state television reported. “America’s goal has been to re-establish the domination it had (before 1979) but it has failed. America has been defeated by the Islamic Republic over the past 40 years,” it quoted Khamenei as saying in a meeting with thousands of students. Washington will on Monday reimpose far-reaching sanctions on Iran’s vital oil export and banking sectors to try to force the Islamic Republic to curb its missile and regional activities and accept tougher restraints on its nuclear programme.

But we don’t know for sure yet. It will be clear on Monday,” Pekcan told reporters in Ankara. An industry source said last month that Turkey had already made efforts to cut its purchases ahead of the U.S. sanctions, but would prefer to keep up some level of Iranian oil imports.

2018-11-03,"BEIJING/DUBAI (Reuters) - China’s state-run Zhenhua Oil is set to sign a head of agreement that includes a proposed joint-venture with Iraq’s state oil marketer SOMO and for 2019 annual crude oil supply in Shanghai next week, two industry officials with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The agreement will be among deals expected at the China International Import Expo during Nov. 5-10, to be attended by thousands of foreign companies and Chinese buyers to demonstrate the importing potential of the world’s No.2 economy.  The joint-venture between SOMO and Zhenhua, which has been under negotiations for months, will help bolster Iraq’s position in Asia, the world’s biggest and fastest-growing oil-consuming region. Iraq is the second-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) oil cartel. The new joint venture will be based in the northern Chinese port city of Tianjin, near Beijing, said the person, who declined to be named as he is not authorised to speak to media. The source did not specify the volume of supply in the annual crude pact.  Companies had been expected to finalise the deal around November. Zhenhua Oil, a subsidiary of China’s defence conglomerate Norinco, is also expected to renew at the expo an annual crude oil supply agreement for 2019 with Saudi state-run oil and gas firm Aramco, said the source, without giving further details. Calls to a Norinco spokesman were not answered.  SOMO and Aramco did not respond to requests for comment.  The Zhenhua-SOMO deal will give China another crude supply option as the country is under pressure to cut oil purchases from Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, as the United States is set to re-impose sanctions on Tehran on Nov. 4.  China’s Iraqi crude oil imports rose to 32.28 million tonnes in the first nine months of the year, or 863,000 barrels per day, 15 percent more than the same year-earlier level, according to Chinese customs data.
