2018-06-20,"June 20 (Reuters) - A U.S. solar company that convinced Washington to impose protective tariffs on cheap imports to help it survive is seeking bankruptcy court approval to abandon its inventory of solar panels as it winds down operations. In a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware late on Tuesday, Suniva Inc requested approval to abandon solar panels with a liquidation value that it says exceeds $6 million. The filing follows news last week that Suniva’s biggest creditor, SQN Capital Management, won an auction of the solar company’s technology, licenses and manufacturing equipment. In a news release, SQN said it was “on the verge of determining which partner will provide the best path to revitalizing the company and meeting the overwhelming demand for Suniva’s high-quality, high-efficiency products.” Suniva roiled the solar industry by starting a battle over tariffs that a leading industry group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, said would drive up the cost of solar and lead to thousands of job losses. Rather than using its tariff victory to reorganize, Suniva last month held an auction for many of its assets and is now seeking to abandon solar panels it had been storing in warehouses, according to the filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. Norcross, Georgia-based Suniva filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April 2017. Days later, it filed a request for tariff relief to help it compete against inexpensive solar panel imports. In its court filing on Tuesday, Suniva said it no longer needs the solar modules for a reorganization and proposed that another creditor, Wanxiang America Corporation, take possession of them in exchange for its claims. The company did not disclose how much it owes Wanxiang, but said it does not believe the value of its inventory exceeds that amount. Suniva also requested that Wanxiang pick up some $689,000 of maintenance costs related to the solar modules, saying it held on to the inventory throughout its bankruptcy proceedings solely for Wanxiang’s benefit. A hearing is scheduled for June 27. Reporting by Tracy Rucinski in Chicago and Nichola Groom in

2018-06-20,"June 20 (Reuters) - As pipelines out of the largest U.S. oil field reach capacity in the coming months, further depressing West Texas crude prices, smaller producers will have to slow or shut-in production, according to oil executives. Soaring production in U.S. shale fields has driven output to a record 10.47 million barrels per day (bpd) this year and any cutbacks would hurt companies recovering from 2014’s crude-price drop. Oil in Midland, Texas now sells for about $6 a barrel less than the U.S. benchmark, compared with $1.50 less in January. It was $13 under the U.S. benchmark in May. Halcon Resources Corp this week said it would remove a drilling rig in the Permian Basin next month because of “lower near-term realized oil prices in the Midland market,” referring to the regional price. Operators who lack guaranteed space on existing pipelines to the U.S. Gulf Coast would be forced to curtail production if the Midland price falls $10 to $47, said Steven Pruett, chief executive of Midland producer Elevation Resources. “People aren’t going to be excited about running rigs if they can’t move their crude oil,” said Pruett. Pipelines could begin rejecting new crude customers as early as next quarter, said Ryan Smith, director of research at consultancy East Daley Capital. The Permian now produces about 3.27 million bpd. Takeaway capacity reached 3.3 million bpd in June, according to Genscape. Scott Sheffield, CEO of shale producer Pioneer Natural Resources Co, said this week that overall Permian output could flatten in the 12-month period ending September 2019, when proposed pipelines are completed. “A lot of independents will have to actually shut in production in the Permian to make room for our growth,” Sheffield said, referring to Pioneer and other companies with guaranteed pipeline space. The number of active drilling rigs in the Permian last week fell by four to 476, and another measure of activity - well completions - fell to 190 last week from 192, according to researcher Primary Vision. “We think the number of completions in the basin does need to come down,” said Colin Davies, an analyst at Bernstein. Discovery Operating, a small oil company in Midland, currently plans to send a drilling rig into the Midland Basin, but if regional oil prices fall below $55 a barrel, the company will put the move on hold, said Jeff Sparks, Discovery’s chief operating officer. “If we’re in the middle of drilling, we might end up with some uncompleted wells,” he said.

2018-06-20,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Wednesday announced a preliminary finding that imports of large-diameter welded pipe from China, India, South Korea and Turkey were subsidized by those countries, and said it was imposing preliminary duties that could top 500 percent. The Commerce Department opened an investigation in March into whether six countries, including Canada and Greece, were dumping the pipe, which is typically used to build oil and gas pipelines, in U.S. markets or were being unfairly subsidized by their governments. The probe is one of more than 100 cases that President Donald Trump’s administration has opened since taking office that are aimed at protecting U.S. manufacturers in global markets. The United States’ increasingly aggressive stance has been denounced by key trading partners and some Americans who warn it could lead to an economically damaging trade war.        The Commerce Department on Wednesday said it was imposing preliminary anti-subsidy duties on imports of the pipe from India of up to 541.15 percent and on those from China of up to 198.49 percent. Pipe imports from South Korea will face countervailing duties from 0.01 percent up to 3.31 percent, and from Turkey from 1.08 percent to 3.76 percent. Imports in 2017 of large-diameter welded pipe were valued at an estimated $29.2 million from China, $294.7 million from India, $150.9 million from South Korea and $57.3 million from Turkey, Commerce figures show. The Commerce Department launched the investigation after a petition from a group of privately held U.S. producers. The probe covered welded carbon and alloy steel pipe larger than 16 inches (406.4 mm) in diameter. Commerce earlier estimated dumping margins on the pipe at 50.89 percent for Canada, 120.84 percent to 132.63 percent for China, 41.04 percent for Greece, 37.94 percent for India, 16.18 percent and 20.39 percent for South Korea, and 66.09 percent for Turkey. “Dumping” is the practice of selling goods below market price. The U.S. International Trade Commission is scheduled to make a final decision by Dec. 20 on whether the subsidies harm U.S. producers, after which Commerce may issue countervailing duty orders that typically run for five years.

2018-06-20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks on world markets edged higher on Wednesday, following a recent sell-off on rapidly escalating China-U.S. trade tensions, while Treasury yields rose after the Federal Reserve chairman said the U.S. central bank should continue with a gradual pace of interest rate hikes. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell cited a labor market that does not seem to be overly tight in advocating staying the course on rate hikes. The S&P 500 snapped a three-session losing streak, while the Nasdaq posted a record high close, boosted by gains in Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Microsoft Inc (MSFT.O). Shares in Boeing Co (BA.N), which has acted as a proxy for trade fears because it is the single largest U.S. exporter to China, rose 0.5 percent after six straight declines. The planemaker said on Wednesday it was confident that a new mid-market jet could enter service in 2025. “Part of it might be people were selling stocks the past couple of days in order of where they see tariff priority,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down slightly, a day after it erased its year-to-date gains amid President Donald Trump’s latest tariff threats against Chinese goods. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 42.41 points, or 0.17 percent, to 24,657.8, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 4.73 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,767.32 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 55.93 points, or 0.72 percent, to 7,781.52. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.31 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.35 percent. In the U.S. Treasury market, Powell’s comments on rate hikes boosted yields. A slew of corporate bond supply also helped drive the sell-off in Treasuries, pushing yields higher, analysts said.   Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 12/32 in price to yield 2.937 percent, from 2.893 percent late on Tuesday. Before Powell’s remarks, U.S. yields had been little changed.  The U.S. dollar was steady, near an 11-month peak against a basket of major currencies, as China’s signal of tolerance of a stronger yuan offset anxiety about the global trade dispute. Before Wednesday's market open, the People's Bank of China cut the yuan's midpoint rate CNY=PBOC to 6.4586 per dollar, the weakest since Jan. 12 and much stronger than market models had suggested.  In U.S. afternoon trading, an index that tracks the dollar against the euro, yen, sterling and three other currencies .DXY was little changed at 95.090, after touching an 11-month peak of 95.299 earlier. In commodities markets, copper prices eased again after an inventory rise highlighted healthy supplies, extending declines from Tuesday tied to trade war worries. Copper CMCU3 lost 0.36 percent to $6,815.50 a ton. Oil prices were mixed, with U.S. crude futures supported by a drop in domestic inventories.

2018-06-20,"June 20 (Reuters) - Iran may agree to an increase in oil output by OPEC and its allies through producers who have overdelivered on cuts moving up to their quotas, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said in an interview with CNN. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and several other producers had agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) starting from January 2017. The agreement has driven down inventories and pushed up oil prices. However, a number of producers including Saudi Arabia have been cutting more deeply than planned despite outages in Venezuela and Libya, meaning they could modestly boost output while complying with their quotas. “The compliance, or I say over-compliance, is close to, in recent months, 150 percent. It doesn’t need any agreement or resolution from OPEC to comply 100 percent”, Zanganeh said. Bringing compliance to 100 percent from current levels would mean adding at least 1 million bpd of crude to the market, sources have said. OPEC meets on Friday to decide output policy amid calls from major consumers such as the United States and China to cool down oil prices and support the global economy by producing more crude. Zanganeh said OPEC members are discussing about going back to 100 percent compliance and they could agree to increase supply at the meeting without the need for new agreement or resolution.

2018-06-20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil markets are bracing for a reshuffle of global trade flows as China threatens to impose tit-for-tat tariffs on imports of U.S. energy products, including crude. China, which has bought an average 330,000 barrels per day (bpd) of U.S. crude oil this year, is threatening to place a 25 percent tariff on various U.S. commodity exports, including crude oil, although it is so far unclear when such a measure would come in place. The decision came in response to U.S. President Donald Trump saying he was pushing ahead with hefty tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports. And it triggered an aggressive response by Trump, who on Monday threatened to slap a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods in addition to the import duties previously announced. The tariffs could restrict the flow of U.S. barrels going to China - a business now worth almost $1 billion per month About 14 million barrels of U.S. crude are set to arrive in China in July, which would be the highest monthly figure on record, according to Thomson Reuters flows data. An import duty would make U.S. oil less competitive than other crudes, almost certainly resulting in a sharp fall of Chinese purchases, forcing U.S. oil firms to find other buyers. In the first three months of this year, U.S. crude made up around 5 percent of China’s total crude imports, according to Chinese customs data. [O/CHINA1] “It’ll take the (U.S. oil) industry a few months to find new outlets,” said Scott Shelton, a broker at ICAP in Durham, adding that U.S. crude flows to Europe and the Mediterranean will likely pick up. (For graphic on U.S. vs international oil prices, click reut.rs/2M7us7P) Outside China, however, WTI remains near a $10 per barrel discount to Brent CL-LCO1=R. Many traders expect this discount to widen further should the flow of U.S. oil to China slow, meaning that other producers would have to deal with high volumes of cheap American oil becoming available in other big markets, including Europe. China, in turn, is likely to replace the U.S. oil with increased purchases from top suppliers Russia and Saudi Arabia. Saudi and Russia are already pushing for an increase in production at a meeting of The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) this week.  “I think it would create a carousel affect where China then buys more alternate grades and other importers buy more U.S. grades,” a U.S.-based trader with a global merchant said. (For graphic on U.S. crude oil exports to China, click reut.rs/2JXqcaa) The United States, where oil production C-OUT-T-EIA has risen by almost a third in the last two years to a weekly record of 10.9 million bpd C-OUT-T-EIA, relies heavily on exports to maintain market balance.  Billions of dollars worth of infrastructure projects are currently underway to facilitate exports further, with China at the center of export growth forecasts.  “Port of Corpus Christi is at the gateway to global markets and certainly to China ... at the end of the day, we are all looking at the long game, which is, we will be selling more energy to China,” said Sean Strawbridge, chief executive of the Port of Corpus Christi Authority in Texas. “I’m sure the political headwinds will subside so we’re not being deterred today, we’re not losing our focus on continuing to develop the needed infrastructure.” Exports surged to an unprecedented 1.76 million bpd in April from 1.67 million bpd in March. European countries, including Italy and the Netherlands, accounted for the bulk of the increase in April U.S. crude exports. Some traders expect U.S. barrels to get trapped if the dispute between the world’s two biggest economies turns into a fully blown trade war, which in turn would force own the price of U.S. crude even further. “There is going to be a sales lull that will keep these barrels trapped and the widening of the spread that we see will persist and get worse before it gets better,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.   For China, the world’s biggest importer of crude oil, relatively higher Brent prices means oil would become more expensive. [CRU/WAF] This would put Chinese refiners at a disadvantage, said John Coleman, senior analyst of North American crude markets at Wood Mackenzie. As the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing heats up, the world’s top oil producers are set to gather in Vienna, Austria, on June 22 to set global output strategy. Producer group OPEC, which is effectively led by Saudi Arabia, has been withholding supplies since 2017 to prop up prices together with non-OPEC members like top producer Russia.   Russia and Saudi Arabia are both pushing for an increase in output to make up for losses in supplies in Venezuela as well as looming U.S. sanctions against Iran. Russia’s flagship Urals crude oil is one of the grades preferred by China’s independent refiners, known as teapots.  Middle East flows to Asian countries such as India have also picked up over the past two months as Brent’s premium over the Dubai benchmark DUB-EFS-1M has widened. Middle East light grades such as Murban, therefore, would now have an even easier time finding a home in China, traders said. Overall, however, traders do not expect serious supply shortfalls to result from Chinese crude tariffs against the United States. “The world’s an awfully big place, consuming an awful lot of oil, so you may not have it that much harder for to go elsewhere,” said Spencer Dale, chief economist at oil major BP. “You may see some differences in ... oil flows (but) I don’t see it, at the moment, as a source of major disruption ... Some of that oil which would’ve been supplied by U.S. into China will go elsewhere,” he added.

2018-06-20,"YAOUNDE (Reuters) - Armed separatists in English-speaking regions of Cameroon have killed over 80 soldiers and police since their insurgency began in September last year, the government said in a report on Wednesday that suggests the conflict is intensifying. What began in late 2016 as a peaceful movement calling for greater representation of the mostly French-speaking country’s Anglophone minority morphed into conflict after a heavy-handed government response, in which troops shot at civilians from helicopter gunships and burned villages. That bolstered support for some in Anglophone Cameroon who want to form a new state called Ambazonia. The unrest in the oil- and cocoa-producing Southwest and Northwest regions often involves hit-and-run attacks by insurgents on the army. “Statistics as of 11 June 2018 showed that 123 attacks had been carried out claiming 84 lives, including 32 soldiers, 42 gendarmes, seven police officers, two prison warders and one eco-guard,” said the report, presented by Prime Minister Philemon Yang at a news conference in Yaounde.   In February, an army spokesman told Reuters separatists had killed 22 soldiers and policemen in the previous five months. No figures are available for casualties on the separatist side, but its leaders says there have been some. The fighting has forced tens of thousands of civilians to flee over the border into Nigeria. In the report, the government pledged 12.7 billion CFA francs ($21.7 million) over 18 months to help nearly 75,000 people who have been displaced across the two Anglophone regions. President Paul Biya seeks reelection in October polls, after leading the country for more than three decades.

2018-06-20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude futures rose nearly 2 percent on Wednesday, supported by a drop in domestic inventories, while Brent edged down ahead of an OPEC meeting later this week that may result in increased global production. U.S. crude inventories USOILC=ECI fell 5.9 million barrels last week, the largest one-week decline since January, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Refinery crude runs rose to 17.7 million barrels per day, the highest on record for this time of year, the EIA data showed.  “Today’s EIA report appeared unequivocally bullish to WTI given a much larger than expected crude stock draw of almost six million barrels that was more than double our anticipated increase,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates in Galena, Illinois, said in a note. “However, the big decline in crude was almost exactly offset by a combined gasoline (and) distillate build of roughly six million barrels.” U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures for July delivery CLc1, which expires on Wednesday, rose $1.15 to settle at $66.22 a barrel, a 1.8 percent gain. WTI futures for August CLc2 closed 81 cents higher at $65.71. Brent crude futures for August delivery LCOc1 fell 34 cents, or 0.5 percent, to end at $74.74 a barrel. Traders said a drop in Libyan supplies, including the loss of a 400,000-barrel storage tank, also helped support prices.  Libya’s oil output has been slashed to between 600,000 and 700,000 bpd from more than 1 million bpd following clashes at its Ras Lanuf and Es Sider oil terminals, a Libyan oil source said. An attack by armed factions opposed to Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) has forced the closure of the two ports since June 14 and the declaration of force majeure on exports. Looming large over markets, however, were meetings scheduled on June 22-23 in Vienna for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other big producers, including Russia. Brent futures fell after Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said that the market demands more oil in the second half of this year and that OPEC was converging on a good decision on production policy this week. “Any developments on OPEC can move us,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Saudi Arabia is trying to convince fellow OPEC members of the need to raise oil output, sources familiar with the talks said on Wednesday. Russia, which is not a part of OPEC but is the world’s biggest oil producer, is also pushing to loosen supply controls introduced to prop up prices in 2017.  Other OPEC members, including Iran, oppose such a move, fearing a price slump. Iran signaled it might allow a small increase in OPEC oil output, letting some OPEC members that had overdelivered on cuts return to compliance with quotas. That would effectively mean a modest boost from producers such as Saudi Arabia that have been cutting more deeply than planned despite production outages in Venezuela and Libya. Scott Sheffield, executive chairman of Pioneer Natural Resource Co (PXD.N) said OPEC should boost output by roughly 1 million bpd over time to keep global crude supply and demand in balance as production dips elsewhere.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the pace should stay the same given that the labor market does not seem to be overly tight. The S&P 500 edged higher along with the Nasdaq, which hit a record high as Facebook Inc and other stocks hit all-time peaks. Boeing Co also rose after selling off on trade war worries the day before. “There haven’t been new trade tariffs announced. Investors can focus a little more on the fundamentals,” said Sameer Samana, global equity and technical strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down slightly, a day after it erased its year-to-date gains amid President Donald Trump’s latest tariff threats against Chinese goods. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 38.33 points, or 0.16 percent, to 24,661.88, the S&P 500 gained 5.54 points, or 0.20 percent, to 2,768.13 and the Nasdaq Composite added 61.04 points, or 0.79 percent, to 7,786.62. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.31 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.34 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.7 percent higher. Shares in Hong Kong, Seoul and mainland Chinese indexes   also rose. Helping those shares was a state radio report that China will use targeted cuts in banks’ reserve requirement ratios and other monetary policy tools to boost credit for small firms. Powell’s comments boosted yields in the U.S. Treasury market. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 9/32 in price to yield 2.926 percent, from 2.893 percent late on Tuesday. Before Powell’s remarks, U.S. yields had been little changed. The euro held slim losses against the dollar as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the factors holding back local wages are subsiding and the ECB is confident inflation in the euro zone would move toward its 2-percent goal.

2018-06-20,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Venezuelan PDVSA’s oil exports fell 32 percent in the first half of June compared with May, according to internal trade reports from the state-run company, as deepening output declines and seizures of some Caribbean assets disrupted crude and fuel shipments.  PDVSA exported 765,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the first two weeks of June, a 368,000-bpd drop versus 1.133 million bpd shipped in May. The numbers do not include cargoes of upgraded oil by two of PDVSA’s joint ventures, which are exported separately. The trade data reveals the extent of the state-run oil firm’s export crisis from declining crude output, a lack of cash for spare parts and equipment, and a loss of employees fleeing due to hyperinflation and the nation’s severe recession. It also underscores how U.S. producer ConocoPhillips’ (COP.N) use of court attachments in the Caribbean to satisfy a $2 billion (£1.5 billion) arbitration award against PDVSA over a 2007 nationalisation have left the Venezuelan company with limited ability to meet supply contracts, especially to Asian customers. PDVSA did not immediately reply to a request for comment. In June, PDVSA increased its loading of larger vessels to deliver bigger cargoes to some customers, according to the company’s reports and Thomson Reuters vessel tracking data. It also began seaborne transfers to ease tanker congestion at the OPEC country’s main oil port of Jose. But the strategy has not succeeded in solving the shipping delays. PDVSA’s exports so far in 2018 average 1.24 million bpd, 26 percent below the 1.68 million bpd shipped last year due to falling output and a lack of access to the Caribbean ports it previously used for shipping and storing oil, according to the company’s documents. As of Wednesday, more than 80 tankers were anchored off  Venezuelan shores, some of which were waiting to load about 22 million barrels of crude and products for export. That backlog was down slightly from a 24-million-barrel peak earlier this month.   Several very large crude carriers (VLCCs) and Suezmax tankers chartered by Reliance Industries (RELI.NS), Nayara Energy ESRO.M3, PDVSA’s U.S. unit Citgo Petroleum and Valero Energy (VLO.N) were among those in line, according to Reuters data. PDVSA this month asked customers not to send tankers to lift oil for exports until it had loaded vessels waiting for weeks at two main Venezuelan ports.  The oil company since has been working to catch up on crude and refined products shipments to its largest customers, but through the first half of June its contract compliance remained low, according to the firm’s data. Deliveries of Merey heavy crude and fuel oil to state-run China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), one of PDVSA’s largest creditors, satisfied only 36 percent of the 550,000 bpd required by its contracts in June, the data showed.  Two VLCCs chartered by CNPC and subsidiaries have been waiting since late May to load crude at Jose, according to Reuters data. Shipments of Boscan heavy crude to Chevron Corp (CVX.N) covered 74 percent of the contracted volume in the first two weeks of June while crude and fuel supplied to Cuba met 67 percent of its 97,000 bpd contract. No crude shipments were delivered to Indian refiners in the first half of the month, out of the 360,000 bpd of Venezuelan crude contracted. But two large tankers carrying 3 million barrels combined were shipped to the Asian country this week, the Reuters data shows. India’s Reliance and Nayara Energy have at least two more deliveries pending this month. Large tankers sent by the  companies have been waiting for up to a month to load at Jose port.

The last change occurred in November 2016, when OPEC and 10 non-OPEC countries agreed to cut output by a combined 1.8 million barrels per day from Jan. 1, 2017. OPEC’s share of the cut is about 1.2 million bpd and two members, Nigeria and Libya, were exempted. OPEC and its allies meet on June 22-23 in Vienna and will discuss whether to ease the supply cut.

2018-06-20,"VIENNA, June 20 (Reuters) - For OPEC, over-compliance with its supply-cutting deal is a nice problem to have. Once known for rampant cheating on agreed oil output targets, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has been over-delivering on a pact in place since January 2017, cutting around one and a half times the promised amount. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on Friday to decide on output policy amid calls from major consumers such as the United States, India and China to cool down oil prices by producing more crude. Three OPEC members - Iran, Venezuela and Iraq - have been reluctant to consent to a formal increase in OPEC’s output target, agreed as part of a deal with Russia and other non-member producers and running until the end of 2018. But on Wednesday, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said OPEC members that had over-delivered on cuts should return to compliance with agreed quotas - a possible compromise to keep both the existing deal and produce more oil. If all OPEC members produced as much as they were allowed under the deal, OPEC output would in theory rise by about 740,000 barrels per day, based on Reuters estimates of the group’s production in May. But in practice it would mean a much smaller boost of less than a 10th of that amount, effectively from Saudi Arabia. Riyadh is considered the only OPEC member pumping below-target that could add significantly more at short notice. While Saudi Arabia’s cutting by more than required has helped OPEC’s compliance, involuntary reductions in Venezuela amid economic crisis and in Angola due to natural decline have had a larger impact and cannot be reversed at short notice. So, a larger increase agreed by OPEC would require a new set of output targets. This could reallocate production from members under-producing their quotas to those that can pump more - namely Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. It could also raise targets for all, even though any increase would come from only a few members. So far there is no indication that Iran and the other members would agree to such a reallocation, although with officials holding extensive talks in the run-up to Friday’s OPEC meeting, further compromise could be made. If the existing deal is retained and Saudi Arabia felt there was a need to add more oil, Riyadh could still increase production unilaterally, as it did after a meeting in June 2011 ended with no decision.

2018-06-20,"(Adds comments from U.S. water expert) By Laurie Goering CAPE TOWN, June 20 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In the next 30 years, cities around the world will face dramatically higher risks from extreme heat, coastal flooding, power blackouts, and food and water shortages unless climate-changing emissions are curbed, urban researchers warned. Currently more than 200 million people in 350 cities face average daily peak temperatures of at least 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) for three months a year, according to a study by C40 Cities, a network of cities pushing climate action. But by 2050, more than 1.6 billion people in 970 cities will face those conditions, researchers predicted. The number of people in poverty and battling brutal heat - usually without air conditioning - will rise tenfold, they said. “This is a wake-up call,” said Kevin Austin, deputy executive director of C40 Cities, at a meeting in Cape Town this week on adapting to climate change. “The magnitude of people affected by heat will be (much) greater than today if we continue to increase greenhouse gases at this rate.” With experts at the meeting predicting extreme weather such as heavy rainfall and flooding could trigger everything from disease outbreaks to road failures, food shortages and closed schools, Austin said cities must take direct action to curb risks as well as cut emissions. In Seoul, for example, an elevated thoroughfare through the centre of the city has been removed, opening up access to the river and lowering heat by at least half a degree, he said. South Korea’s capital also has planted more than 16 million trees and created shaded cooling centres. “We want to encourage cities to adopt more of these solutions and implement them as quickly as possible,” Austin said. The research, carried out by the New York-based Urban Climate Change Research Network, looked at data from more than 2,500 cities and predicted likely conditions if emissions continue to rise at their current rate. It found that Cape Town’s ongoing battle with drought-driven water shortages could become far more common, with over 650 million people in 500 cities - among them Sao Paulo and Tehran - likely to see their access to water reduced by 2050. Many cities are already aiming to cap water use per person, with Los Angeles pushing for 200 litres a day, Melbourne for 155 litres and Cape Town a dramatically reduced 50, Austin said. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that an average American today uses at least 300 litres of water per day. Austin said sharing advice on how to make cuts - including insights gained in Cape Town which has slashed its water use by half in the face of extreme drought - can save cities time. Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille said dealing with a crisis when it arrives leaves little room to manoeuvre. “In a crisis like this there is no time to go by trial and error. You unfortunately have to get it right the first time,” she said at the Adaptation Futures conference in Cape Town. The C40 Cities study also found that by mid-century over 800 million people will live in 570 coastal cities at risk of flooding from weather extremes and sea level rise. Flooding presents a particular risk to urban power supplies, with many power stations located in flood-prone areas, putting everything from transportation to heating and hospitals at risk. Decentralising power systems - including by getting clean energy from a larger number of smaller power plants - could help cut the risks, researchers said. But flooding risks may be coming faster than expected. Patrick Child, the European Commission’s deputy director-general for research and innovation, said a predicted one metre (3 foot) rise in sea levels once anticipated by 2100 is now likely by 2070. Last year saw the highest-ever documented economic losses from severe weather and climate change globally, he said. Flooding as well as water scarcity are two of the biggest challenges facing cities, said Jeff Hebert, vice president for adaptation and resilience at the U.S.-based Water Institute of the Gulf and former chief resilience officer of New Orleans. “Cities are constantly having to navigate between the extremes of too much water or not enough of it,” Hebert told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview in London. Looking at just one type of problem - such as a health threats from extreme heat, or sea level rise - also isn’t enough to capture the risks, said Cynthia Rosenzweig, a climatologist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and one of the authors of the report. “In cities, all of these impacts interact with each other, and are all happening at the same time,” she said. Solutions also need combined approaches, with engineering efforts to cut flooding, for instance, working hand in hand with things like better protection of flood-absorbing wetlands, Rosenzweig said. Rosenzweig said she hoped the research would help city officials prioritise what changes need to happen first to better protect their citizens. In cities ""it's often overwhelming, with so many things to do,"" she said.

2018-06-20,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran signaled on Wednesday it could compromise on a small increase in OPEC oil output when the group meets this week, as Saudi Arabia scrambled to convince fellow members of the need for a larger rise in production. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on Friday to decide output policy amid calls from major consumers such as the United States and China to cool down oil prices and support the global economy by producing more crude. Iran said on Tuesday OPEC was unlikely to reach a deal, setting the stage for a clash with kingpin Saudi Arabia and non-member Russia, which are pushing to raise production steeply from July to meet growing global demand. But on Wednesday, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said OPEC members that had overdelivered on cuts in recent months should comply with agreed quotas. That would effectively mean a modest boost from producers such as Saudi Arabia that have been cutting more deeply than planned despite production outages in Venezuela and Libya.  “OPEC could keep the same deal with compliance going back to 100 percent,” said an OPEC source who is aware of Iran’s stance. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said he was confident there would be a deal when the producer group meets in Vienna on Friday. Russia has proposed OPEC and non-OPEC producers raise output by 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd), effectively wiping out existing production cuts of 1.8 million bpd that have helped rebalance the market in the past 18 months and lifted oil LCOc1 to $75 per barrel. Oil traded as low as $27 in 2016. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih also said on Wednesday that the market demanded more oil in the second half of this year and that OPEC was moving toward “a good decision”.   Ecuador said OPEC and its allies could agree to a compromise increase in output of around 0.5-0.6 million bpd. A decision to increase output could be taken even with Iran refusing to sign up, as has happened before in OPEC. For graphic on IEA estimates of non-OPEC supply growth in 2018 click reut.rs/2rJnnCO ADDRESSING OVER-COMPLIANCE Iran has so far been the main barrier to a deal, with Zanganeh saying OPEC should not yield to pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to raise output. He said Trump had contributed to the rise in prices by imposing sanctions on OPEC members Iran and Venezuela, which will likely lead to lower exports. Zanganeh said he would leave Vienna on Friday even before OPEC holds talks with non-OPEC producers the next day, but efforts were underway on Wednesday to convince Iran to participate in a deal. Sources said Saudi Arabia did not want to be seen as putting too much pressure on Iran and hence Russia was instead trying to convince Tehran. Zanganeh was due to attend a ministerial committee on Thursday, two sources said. Iran is usually not part of the committee, which includes Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait, Algeria and Venezuela. Iraq and Venezuela have also opposed a relaxation of production cuts, fearing a slump in prices. For graphic on IEA estimates of global oil demand growth click reut.rs/2Ik645v Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said on Wednesday he hoped there would be agreement when OPEC meets but added: “The oil market has not reached the level of stabilization.” Gulf producers usually aligned with Saudi Arabia - the UAE, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain - have also cautioned against a large output increase and signaled they have been rattled by Riyadh’s close coordination with Russia, sources have said. Gulf oil producers’ views still differed on Wednesday on how much to increase production and whether such a move should be gradual, sources said. They nevertheless tried to bring Iran on board for a deal, with ministers from the UAE, Kuwait and Oman meeting Zanganeh on Wednesday. Oman’s oil minister Mohammed bin Hamad Al-Rumhy said he believed Iran would agree to an output increase on Friday. He said the meeting would tackle over-compliance with oil output cuts and that Iran was “very cooperative”.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the pace should stay the same given that the labor market does not seem to be overly tight. The S&P 500 edged higher along with the Nasdaq, with technology shares providing support. Boeing also rose after selling off on trade war worries the day before. “A lot of people believe the track that the (U.S.) president is taking is a negotiation tactic. And the people who still think the trade war will develop, believe it would be China that comes to the table with concessions first,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average erased its year-to-date gains on Tuesday after President Donald Trump’s latest tariff threats against Chinese goods. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 44.72 points, or 0.18 percent, to 24,655.49, the S&P 500 gained 6.34 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,768.93 and the Nasdaq Composite added 55.39 points, or 0.72 percent, to 7,780.97. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.46 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.41 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.72 percent higher, while shares in Hong Kong, Seoul and mainland Chinese indexes also rose. Helping those shares was a state radio report that China will use targeted cuts in banks’ reserve requirement ratios and other monetary policy tools to boost credit for small firms. Powell’s comments boosted yields in the U.S. Treasury market. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 5/32 in price to yield 2.9114 percent, from 2.893 percent late on Tuesday. Before Powell’s remarks, U.S. yields had been little changed. The euro held slim losses against the dollar as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the factors holding back local wages are subsiding and the ECB is confident inflation in the euro zone would move toward its 2-percent goal. The dollar index fell 0.09 percent, with the euro down 0.03 percent to $1.1585. In commodities markets, copper prices eased again after an inventory rise highlighted healthy supplies, extending declines from Tuesday tied to trade war worries. Copper lost 0.94 percent to $6,776.00 a tonne. U.S. crude rose 1.63 percent to $66.13 per barrel and Brent was last at $75.19, up 0.15 percent. Additional reporting by Richard Leong and Gertrude

Muhammadu Buhari is pushing to foster growth in Nigeria, which has west Africa’s biggest economy, before an election next February in which he will seek a second term. His economic policies, and their impact on Nigerians, could sway voters. Nigeria’s parliament, the National Assembly, passed the budget last month. The total sum is higher than the 8.6 trillion naira spending plan presented to parliament by Buhari in November, which lawmakers said was due to an increase in the assumed oil price to $51 per barrel from $45. Buhari was critical of changes made by the National Assembly, which he said cut a total of 347 billion naira for 4,700 projects submitted to them for consideration and introduced 6,403 projects of their own amounting to 578 billion naira. He cited examples of funds being cut, including 8.7 billion taken from a housing programme, and said lawmakers added projects that were not properly assessed. Buhari also said parliament increased its own budget from 125 billion naira to 139.5 billion naira. “I have decided to sign the 2018 budget in order not to further slowdown the pace of recovery of our economy, which has doubtlessly been affected by the delay in passing the budget,” said Buhari in a speech after the signing. Nigeria, Africa’s top oil producer, emerged from its first recession in 25 years in 2017, helped by higher crude prices, but growth remains fragile. “It is my intention to seek to remedy some of the most critical of these issues through a supplementary and/or amendment budget, which I hope the National Assembly will be able to expeditiously consider,” Buhari said. A spokesman for the lower house of parliament, the House of Representatives, said some projects put forward by the executive “do not meet the needs of the common man” and the legislature aimed to help those it represents. “The additional costs and projects to the budget were done in good faith for the sole purpose of improving the lives of Nigerians,” said the spokesman, Abdulrazak Namdas. A spokesmen for the upper house of parliament could not immediately be reached. Budgets under Buhari, who took office in May 2015, have been Nigeria’s largest ever - the latest is up from last year’s 7.44 trillion-naira spending plan. But economists say implementation has been poor and failed to provide the type of capital spending needed to improve infrastructure. “Despite the approach of elections in early 2019, there is no reason to assume this time around that all of the spending plans will necessarily be executed,” said Razia Khan, chief Africa economist at Standard Chartered Bank. She added that the plan for a supplementary budget was “likely to be because of some degree of uncertainty as to the value of all the spending projects that were proposed by the Senate and approved”. John Ashbourne, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said next year’s vote, in which some legislators will seek election, may have led to the insertion of some projects by lawmakers. The International Monetary Fund in February said Nigerians were getting poorer despite the recovery from recession. Inflation has fallen for 16 straight months, slowing to a more than two year low of 11.6 percent in May .

2018-06-20,"VIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC, which has lost Chinese market share to U.S. oil producers, should in theory view a tariff spat between Beijing and Washington as a boon. But while OPEC can sell more oil to China as a result of import tariffs on U.S. crude, in the long term the trade dispute could hit economic growth and oil demand, OPEC officials and oil executives said. “In the long term, this will have a negative effect on the global economy even if, in the short term, it might be positive for other non-U.S. producers,” Austrian oil company OMV’s chief executive Rainer Seele said on the sidelines of an OPEC seminar in Vienna. “In the long-term, (U.S. President Donald) Trump’s policies will weigh on the global economy.” A trade spat between the U.S. and China escalated last week with China threatening to slap a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of U.S. goods, including oil and refined products. “Trade wars (are) not good news for the world economy,” Total’s chief executive Patrick Pouyanne told the seminar. Pouyanne said it was also not good news to see tariffs on steel and aluminum which could impact the costs of oil company investments. “So I think all that is part of what OPEC ministers should keep in mind.” Oil executives are meeting OPEC ministers this week ahead of an OPEC gathering on Friday, which is set to decide on new output policies. U.S. President Donald Trump has called on OPEC to raise production to cool down oil prices. China has been the largest Asian buyer of U.S. crude with U.S. exports booming thanks to the country’s shale revolution. U.S. oil exports to China exceed 300,000 barrels per day and compete with long-term OPEC suppliers such as African producers of light crude including Nigeria, Angola and Algeria. “For sure, it is good news for Algerian crude,” an Algerian oil source said when asked about the impact of the U.S./China trade spat. “New tariffs will support flow from others sources starting from the fourth quarter. It is also a period of robust demand in China,” the source said asking not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the press. An OPEC source said he believed Chinese buyers would increase purchases of light crude grades from other OPEC members such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, the UAE and even Iran. “But in the long run ... it is not helpful. It is destructive for the global economy,” the OPEC source said, referring to the U.S./China dispute. Majid Jafar, chief executive of UAE-based Crescent Petroleum, said: “Beyond short-term targeting of U.S. oil exports, oil producers need to be concerned about how potential major disruption to the global trade and economic systems could harm demand over the longer term.” Jamie Webster, analyst from Boston Consulting Group, also said that even though Chinese tariffs represented an opportunity for OPEC to sell more crude they also created more oversupply in the United States, potentially pushing oil prices down. BP’s chief executive Bob Dudley said he did not believe the trade spat could tilt the global economy into a recession. “I think when you put sanctions and tariffs ...  the world will respond and figure out ways around it and I think the demand for energy will remain.” Scott Sheffield, executive chairman of U.S. oil producer Pioneer, said he has not discussed new tariffs either with the White House or OPEC and said he believed U.S. crude exports were set to grow to 4.0-4.5 million bpd in next several years from the current 2.6 million bpd. “Hopefully we can find another home for that oil,” he said adding that Singapore, South Korea, Japan and the European Union could mop up what China does not take.

2018-06-20,"(Adds additional details, quotes, prices) June 20 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil stockpiles dropped sharply last week  while gasoline and distillate inventories grew as refineries’ crude runs rose to their highest on record seasonally, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude inventories fell by 5.9 million barrels in the week to June 15, the largest one-week decline since January, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 1.9 million barrels. Stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures fell by 1.3 million barrels, EIA said. Refinery crude runs rose 196,000 barrels per day to 17.7 million bpd last week, the most on a seasonal basis on record, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates rose by 1 percentage point to 96.7 percent of total capacity, the highest rate since December, as Gulf refining utilization rates rose. “What you’ve continued to see here is maintenance season continues to wind down for the refinery sector, so that obviously bodes well for continued crude oil demand,” said Nick Holmes, an investment analyst on the energy portfolio team at Tortoise Capital in Leawood, Kansas. Crude prices rose on the news, with U.S. futures gaining 77 cents to $65.84 a barrel and Brent crude, the London benchmark, rising 7 cents to $75.15 a barrel. Gasoline stocks rose 3.3 million barrels, compared with analyst expectations in a Reuters poll for a 188,000-barrel gain. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose 2.7 million barrels, versus expectations for a 164,000-barrel drop, the EIA data showed.

2018-06-20,"MUNICH (Reuters) - Munich prosecutors questioned Audi’s arrested Chief Executive Rupert Stadler about a global diesel-cheating scandal on Wednesday, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.  Stadler, who was arrested on Monday and is being held at a prison in the southern German city of Augsburg, spoke with investigators in the presence of his lawyer, the source added.  Prosecutors and Stadler’s lawyer did not comment on the nature of their discussion. Stadler himself was not reachable for comment. Audi (NSUG.DE), the premium brand of carmaker Volkswagen Group (VOWG_p.DE), has said Stadler should be presumed innocent until proven otherwise. Munich prosecutors are investigating him for suspected fraud and false advertising in connection with emissions test cheating by Audi - part of the broader “dieselgate” scandal that has engulfed Volkswagen (VW) since 2015.  They remanded Stadler in custody on Monday to prevent him from obstructing their probe. Stadler on Tuesday temporarily stepped down from his position as CEO of Audi and as a member of VW’s management board. Audi named Abraham Schot as interim CEO. Stadler has been under fire ever since Audi admitted to using cheating software in November 2015 - two months after VW - but has enjoyed backing from members of the Porsche and Piech families who control VW and Audi. The technique of using software to detect a pollution test procedure, and to increase the effectiveness of emissions filters to mask pollution levels during tests, was first developed at Audi. “In designing the defeat device, VW engineers borrowed the original concept of the dual-mode, emissions cycle-beating software from Audi,” VW said in its plea agreement with U.S. authorities in January 2017, in which the company agreed to pay a $4.3 billion fine to reach a settlement with U.S. regulators. VW has insisted the development of illegal software, also known as “defeat devices”, was the work of low-level employees, and that no management board members were involved. U.S. prosecutors have challenged this by indicting VW’s former CEO Martin Winterkorn. Investigations in Germany are continuing.

2018-06-20,"PARIS (Reuters) - The French government on Wednesday approved six long-delayed offshore wind projects but sharply cut their subsidies.  In 2012-14, France had awarded tenders for the six projects to French and foreign utilities with contracts to sell electricity at feed-in tariffs guaranteed by the government of around 200 euros per megawatt (MW) for 20 years.  But public opposition to wind farms has long delayed the projects, and since then prices for international offshore wind power have more than halved. French energy regulator CRE has said the projects were too costly, with planned subsidies adding up to nearly 41 billion euros ($47.5 billion). “We will bring about renewable energy more quickly and less expensively: the projects are confirmed, their public subsidy is reduced by 40 percent,” French President Emmanuel Macron said on Twitter, confirming earlier tweets by two utility executives.  Environment Minister Nicolas Hulot also said in a Twitter statement that the projects’ tariffs would be cut to about 150 euros per MW from 200 MW. In March, the government had proposed renegotiating and possibly canceling the projects, which are for a combined 3,000 megawatts of offshore wind on six sites on France’s west coast. In 2012, two consortia, one led by French state-owned  utility EDF and one by Spanish utility Iberdrola, won tenders for combined offshore capacity of 2,000 MW, representing investment of about 7 billion euros. In 2014, a consortium led by Engie won a tender for 1,000 MW, worth some 4 billion euros. The renewable energy industry has been sharply critical of the government for reneging on its contract, saying that they are not to blame for the delays.  When France awarded the tenders at what even then were relatively high prices, it wanted state-owned firms Areva and Alstom to deliver French-design wind turbines for the projects and thus launch a French offshore wind industry to compete with Denmark’s Vestas and Germany’s Siemens.  But since then the two French firms’ wind turbine activities have been bought by foreign companies - Areva’s by Siemens and Gamesa and Alstom’s by GE - and France has had to drop its dream of developing a French offshore wind industry.  GE said in a statement it welcomed the government’s decision to go ahead with the projects, which it said would create jobs and economic growth.

2018-06-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s biggest labour union is balloting rig workers at three of Total’s (TOTF.PA) North Sea oil platforms over a potential strike due to the company’s refusal to reduce the number of unpaid working days, the union said on Wednesday. After the oil price crash in 2014, the workers agreed to work an extra 14 days unpaid to help the company during the downturn, Wullie Wallace, regional officer of Unite the Union said. However, with the recovery in oil prices to around $75 a barrel, their highest in over three years, the workers want to return to the previous system, which Total has so far refused. The ballot will end on June 28 and any industrial action would affect oil output from the Alwyn, Dunbar and Elgin-Franklin platforms, most of which feeds into the key Forties crude stream. Some also contributes to the benchmark Brent grade. Wallace said industrial action could take two forms - an end to working overtime or a series of 24-hour strikes, which would affect output.  The workers include those in the control room and production technicians. An output disruption could impact the global oil market as the price of Forties crude is one of the five grades used to set the dated Brent benchmark, which is in turn used to price the bulk of the world’s oil trades. Around one fifth of all North Sea oil comes from the Forties crude stream. [O/LOAD] “The company has rejected Unite’s proposal to reduce the number of ‘claw-back’ days worked offshore ... The days were given up for no extra payments in order to assist Total E&P UK at the height of the downturn,” Unite said in a statement.  Instead, the union said the company had proposed a new system of three-week work shifts versus the traditional two weeks, which would bring the number of extra days to 21.  “No one should be expected to work twenty one days in a row, working twelve hour shifts, being pushed to the limits of what is safe mentally and physically,” Wallace said in the statement.  Total said it was consulting with its workforce and the proposed rota change was prompted by its acquisition of Maersk Oil that completed in March. The purchase made Total the second largest operator in the North Sea.  “Following the recent acquisition of Maersk Oil we now have a number of different rotas across our worksites and we would like to introduce a uniform system,” a Total spokeswoman said.  Unite said the industry has been gradually shifting to longer shifts and that raised the likelihood of health problems.  “The three on/three off rota pattern is now worked by 56 percent of the workforce offshore, compared with just 17 percent working the same pattern in 2007,” it said. The world’s top oil companies had to make drastic cuts during the oil price downturn. Their balance sheets showed a recovery last year, while in 2018 the majors are expected to generate more cash than at any time this decade. Total recovered faster than some of its competitors, posting a 28 percent rise in net profit last year.

2018-06-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - The United Kingdom needs to urgently clarify how trade with the European Union will work after Brexit, and the world’s fifth-largest economy should remain in the customs union unless there is a proper alternative, the boss of Siemens UK said. With only nine months left until the United Kingdom is due to leave the EU, little is yet clear about how trade will flow as Prime Minister Theresa May, who is grappling with a rebellion in her party, is still trying to strike a deal with the bloc. “My biggest worry about Brexit is that I don’t know what we are planning for,” Juergen Maier, 54, the UK CEO of German engineering giant Siemens told Reuters in an interview. “We need to put something in place quickly that works and if that is not possible, and until that point, then we have to just default to staying in the customs union,” Maier said. May has ruled out staying in the EU customs union, which clubs the 28 EU members in a duty-free area where there is a common import tariff for non-EU goods. But the nature of the future trading relationship with the world’s biggest trading bloc has split May’s government and Conservative Party. Under the current timetable, both London and Brussels are working towards a final Brexit deal in October to give enough time to ratify it by Brexit day in March 2019. Maier said: “We ship thousands of goods daily across the borders that help keep power stations running, that help keep trains running, that help keep British manufacturing running - are those parts going to be able to pass pretty frictionlessly over the border?”  “Or are we going to be in a situation where we have supply chains that are struggling to deliver to us and where we are struggling to export from the UK?” The views of the Siemens boss highlight the growing sense of nervousness among business leaders about the prospect of Britain crashing out of the bloc without a deal or with a deal that would silt up the arteries of trade. The UK is Siemens’ fourth-largest market after the United States, Germany and China. It employs 15,000 people in the UK and 56,000 UK jobs depend on it. “If the Brexit we end up having provides significant friction, provides significant cost then of course that will be an argument against making investments here in the UK,” he said. Maier, who was born in Germany and moved to the UK when he was 10, said he was not seeking to stop Brexit but wanted  Britain to seek a “soft and reasonable” departure. Around 52 percent of the UK’s total $1.1 trillion trade in goods last year was with the EU so May wants to sign a free trade agreement and negotiate an as yet relatively undefined customs arrangement to ensure as frictionless trade as possible. The options discussed so far, though, offer nothing close to the current ease of trade, according to Maier. “I would like to stay in the customs union until we see a workable alternative and I haven’t seen one yet,” he said. Maier said that adding just two minutes onto every lorry’s customs procedure passing through the southern English port of Dover would produce a 14-mile tailback on either side of the Channel after one day. Supporters of Brexit admit there may be some short-term pain for the UK’s $2.9 trillion economy but that long-term it will prosper when cut free from the EU which they cast as a failing German-dominated experiment in European integration. Many CEOs, though, fear that a disorderly Brexit will disrupt supply chains across Europe and cripple the economy for at least a decade by deterring investment. Maier said planning for Brexit was tough. “The fact is - it is very difficult because we don’t know exactly what we are planning for. Contingency planning is very difficult when the options are so varied.”  “We have got contingency plans that we can implement depending on various scenarios and one of those scenarios is a no deal - but let me tell you that scenario doesn’t look very good,” he said. So how much has all that Brexit worry cost Siemens so far? “We haven’t put a figure on what Brexit has cost us so far. But it is relatively small to what a Brexit is likely to cost, especially in a no deal scenario.” Editing by Stephen Addison and Elaine Hardcastle",https://uk.reuters.com/article/britain-eu-siemens/update-2-siemens-uk-boss-give-us-clarity-on-how-post-brexit-trade-will-work-idUKL8N1TM433,20 Jun 2018,"The United Kingdom needs to

2018-06-20,"THOOTHUKUDI, India (Reuters) - Vedanta Ltd said on Wednesday a sulphuric acid leak from a tank at its southern Indian copper smelter was severe and inaction could lead to serious environmental consequences.  The district administration had said on Sunday the leak at the plant in the seaside town of Thoothukudi was minor, and steps were being taken to empty the storage tanks as a safety precaution. “There is a severe leakage in the pipe flanges and ... the pipe flanges are submerged in the acid pool collected in the dykes around the acid storage tank,” the company said in a petition to the Madras high court. The Tamil Nadu state government ordered a permanent closure of the plant and disconnected the power supply last month following protests over alleged pollution that turned violent and culminated in the police opening fire on protesters, killing 13 of them. Vedanta, the Indian subsidiary of London-listed Vedanta Resources, said it sought a limited reconnection of the electricity supply for maintenance to guard against a potential loss of life and damage to air and ground water. “There is a grave risk and danger as there are other tanks and there are flammable chemicals and materials within the plant area,” it said. However, the district’s top administrative official Sandeep Nanduri stuck to the earlier view that the leak was minor.  “That is their version, and this is ours. However, we are completely evacuating the sulphuric acid from all tanks as a safety precaution,” said Nanduri. Activists and residents have demanded a permanent shutdown of the plant, which they said was causing air and water pollution. Locals and activists see the smelter as a risk to fisheries. Vedanta says the protests are based on false notions. Police said on Wednesday they had arrested about 50 people over the past week, taking the total to 254 for rioting and causing damage to property. Some people said they were being unfairly targeted over the protests and there was an atmosphere of fear in the town and surrounding villages. Naseeba Bhanu, from a village 115 km from the town, said she had only learnt from a television news bulletin that her husband and two sons, who had taken part in the protests, had been arrested under the National Security Act, which gives police the authority to detain people without charge for up to a year. Police officer Murali Ramba said things were returning to normal after the violence that erupted last month, the most serious anti-industrial action in years in India. “Women were sleeping outside their houses till 2 days ago, fearing late-night raids. They have gone back to sleeping in their houses after we assured them there was no reason to fear,” he said. The smelter, which has been shut for about three months, accounted for over a third of India’s refined copper production, and employed over 3,000 people. The company plans to appeal the government’s move to shut the plant.

2018-06-20,"BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Slovakia will postpone a decision on whether to buy U.S.-made F-16s or Swedish Gripen fighter jets to replace its ageing Russian-made MiG-29s, Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini said on Wednesday. The defence ministry was originally expected to submit an analysis of the two options by June 29 for government approval, but Pellegrini said it was too big a decision to be made under pressure. “I want to see comparable offers to eliminate any doubts. This is a serious decision worth billions of euros,” he said.   Slovakia, a member of NATO, has a maintenance contract with Russia for its 12 MiG-29s until autumn 2019.  The contract worth 20 million to 50 million euros ($25 million to $80 million) a year, under which dozens of Russian technicians are based at a Slovak military air base, will need to be extended even after the government signs a deal to buy new jets, while it awaits delivery. New Gripen jets would take 18 to 24 months to deliver while F-16s may take until around 2023, said Jaroslav Nad, an analyst from the Slovak Security Police Institute. “Both options would be a step forward for Slovakia, however, there has been no public debate on whether the country needs the more expensive and more advanced F-16s or the more budget-friendly Gripens,” he added. The ministry has not disclosed the purchase and maintenance costs of the jets. Slovakia had been in talks with Gripen maker Saab for years, before Defence Minister Peter Gajdos, from the junior coalition nationalist and eurosceptic SNS party, paused the talks and invited other bidders. That sparked criticism from coalition partners that delays in closing the deal would prolong Slovakia’s dependence on Russia.   Saab said last month it would move a support centre from Sweden to Slovakia, which may service Gripens in service in several European countries, if it wins the deal.  Neighbouring Hungary and the Czech Republic operate Gripens. Poland flies a large fleet of 48 F-16s, built by Lockheed Martin Corp, while also keeping around 30 MiG 29s. Bulgaria, the only other EU member state that still relies on Soviet-made MiG-29s, called for bids earlier this month to buy 16 new or used fighters to replace them. Slovakia plans to spend about 6.5 billion euros by 2030 to modernise its military. Defence spending is due to rise from 1.2 percent of gross domestic product this year to 1.6 percent in 2020 and 2.0 percent by 2024.

The two said they had presented the proposals to Germany’s energy regulator, the Federal Network Agency, with a view to securing permission for plans that stretch to 2030, a period when Germany is phasing in tougher climate protection goals. “We are looking at 50 to 100 megawatt (MW) size ptg plants, potentially in Lower Saxony or northern North-Rhine Westphalia state,” Amprion board member Hans-Juergen Brick said by phone after a press conference in Berlin. “A first plant could go up in 2022 or early 2023,” he added. Ptg technology offers a way to solve the storage problem of volatile electricity output from wind and sunshine by running it through water to split it into oxygen and hydrogen, which can be used as a transport fuel or fed into gas grids. Grids must deploy new strategies to cope with the government’s latest targets to nearly double the share of wind and solar power to 65 percent of electricity generation by 2030. So far, ptg plants have only been up to 6 MW in size, at non-commercial test locations. “While government plans say they want 2,000 - 3,000 MW of power storage by 2030, we won’t get far with a maximum 6 MW per plant,” Brick said. The ptg plants would complement thousands of kilometres of new north to south cables also planned by Amprion and its peers to come online by 2025, to accompany the boom in green power production. But the lines have been delayed by public opposition. Amprion’s annual report showed that of Germany’s targeted 153 gigawatts (GW) of installed renewable capacity by 2030, 60 percent has already been put in. But only 11 percent of a total 7,900 km of new power lines designated to accompany the new capacity has been built. This has resulted in northern Germany often wasting excess wind power, while the industrial south risks shortfalls. The resulting costs for redispatch - major intervention measures on the power grid by engineers - in 2017 rose by 75 percent to 1.4 billion euros ($1.6 billion). This is contentious as consumers must share grid costs as part of their bills. $1 = 0.8651 euros

2018-06-20,"LONDON/ OSLO (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell announced the sale on Wednesday of oil and gas assets in Norway and Malaysia for over $1.3 billion (988 million pounds), bringing it closer to a target of $30 billion in disposals by year-end. The Anglo-Dutch company agreed to sell to OKEA, a Norwegian producer backed by private equity firm Seacrest Capital, its 45 percent interest in the Draugen Norwegian offshore field and a 12 percent in the Gjoa block for a total of $566 million, the two companies said. Earlier, Shell announced the completion of the sale of a 15 percent stake in Malaysia LNG (MLNG) Tiga to the Sarawak State Financial Secretary for $750 million. Shell committed to the ambitious three-year sale plan following the decision to acquire BG Group in 2015, a deal that was completed in February 2016 for $54 billion.  The latest announcement bring the total assets Shell has sold or agreed to sell since 2015 to around $27 billion, according to Reuters calculations. Shell will remain present in oil-rich Norway through its stakes in several fields, including Ormen Lange and Knarr, which it operates. For OKEA, co-founded by the county’s former oil minister Ola Borten Moe in 2015, the deal provides the first sizeable stakes in a producing field on the Norwegian continental shelf. OKEA said the two fields will deliver around 22,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net to the company. Bangchak Corporation PCL, a Thai downstream oil and gas company, had entered into a strategic partnership with Seacrest Capital Group to finance the acquisition, OKEA said.  OKEA also said it had launched a $180 million, 5-year, fully underwritten senior secured bond to help finance the deal. Shell-operated Draugen, which has been producing oil since 1993, had about 24 million barrels in reserves left at end-2017, data from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) shows.    The Gjoa field, operated by Neptune Energy, had 13 million barrels of oil and 13.5 billion cubic metres of natural gas at end-2017, according to NPD data. OKEA has a tiny stake in Aker BP-operated Ivar Aasen field, and a 15 percent interest in Repsol-operated Yme field, which is expected to start producing oil again in late 2019.     The Norwegian government approved Yme’s more than 8 billion crown ($978 million) redevelopment project in March.     A previous attempt by Talisman Energy to restart the field, which was shut in 2001, failed in 2016 due to structural problems with its new production platform.

2018-06-20,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union on Wednesday finalised new climate rules after months of talks, targeting a total energy saving of 32.5 percent and an uplift in the share of renewable energy to 32 percent by 2030. National governments must now draft their own plans for implementing the bloc’s overall climate goal of lowering greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 in line with the Paris Agreement. Talks have dragged on for months to reach a compromise between the European Parliament and EU member states on the new energy efficiency and renewable energy targets after 2021 as well as the rules governing implementation. A push by lawmakers for more ambitious targets and tougher monitoring of efforts met with resistance from member states wary of the economic impact of efforts to reduce emissions. Environmental groups and Green group lawmakers warned the agreement still falls short of the Paris Agreement’s pledge to keep global warming well below 2 degrees. “The measures are not enough for the EU to fulfill its commitments under the Paris Agreement,” Green parliamentarian Benedek Javor said. “They will need to be strengthened in time if we are to meet our climate obligations.” The final deal includes a clause allowing for the bloc to revise up climate goals in 2023. Analysts at Thomson Reuters said the change to the renewable target is likely to impact future carbon prices in Europe’s Emissions Trading System (ETS). The ETS is the EU’s flagship tool for reducing greenhouse gases by charging some 12,000 airlines, industrial and power installations for each tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) they emit. The analysts said they expect carbon emissions from the power sector to be 700 million tonnes, or 6.5 percent lower, than previously forecast by 2030, as more electricity comes from renewable generation such as wind and solar and less comes from polluting fossil fuels. Lower emissions mean there will be less demand for carbon permits in the ETS, leading the analysts to cut their carbon price forecast for 2030 by 6 euros to 29 euros a tonne.

2018-06-20,"* MSCI World index snaps 5-day losing streak as Asia bounces * China markets reverse losses on indications of policy support * European shares higher, futures signal Wall Street will rise * Tentative gains on emerging currencies, stocks (Updates prices, adds chart) By Sujata Rao LONDON, June 20 (Reuters) - World stocks steadied near three-week lows on Wednesday and Chinese markets bounced after recent sharp falls as expectations grew that policy stimulus by Beijing could temper some of the impact from an escalating Sino-U.S. trade conflict. The dollar too eased off 11-month highs against a currency basket, Wall Street looked set for a stronger opening and MSCI’s all-country equity index snapped a five-day run of losses, rising 0.3 percent. Its rebound was fuelled by a bounce of almost 1 percent in MSCI’s non-Japan Asian shares off 6-1/2-month lows , following gains in Hong Kong, Seoul and mainland Chinese indexes  . Assets perceived to be safe, such as the yen, Swiss franc and government bonds of Germany and the United States, took a step back after hefty recent rallies. “I suspect safe-havens such as Bunds and Treasuries could be put to the test as risk sentiment shows signs of stabilising,” Commerzbank strategist Rainer Guntermann said. One catalyst was the expectation, fuelled by a Chinese central bank paper, of cuts to banks’ reserve requirement ratios (RRR) to boost market liquidity and loosen monetary conditions. China’s cabinet on Wednesday pledged to use “targeted RRR cuts”, with cuts now seen as a matter of time. After lending financial institutions 200 billion yuan ($31 billion) on Tuesday, it soothed markets further by fixing the yuan rate higher against the dollar, after the currency posted its biggest daily fall in 1-1/2 years. But worries about a fully fledged trade war between the two biggest world economies remain. Washington is threatening tariffs on $200 billion more of Chinese goods and a White House trade adviser said Beijing was underestimating President Donald Trump’s resolve to impose more tariffs. Tit-for-tat tariffs would hit world growth, company profits and price stability at a time when several big central banks, notably the U.S. Federal Reserve, are in policy tightening mode. The Asian gains encouraged European bourses to open higher, with a pan-European index up 0.6 percent after slumping on Tuesday to two-month lows. European auto shares, a sector highly vulnerable to U.S. tariffs, also rose 0.2 percent though it has lost 2 percent this week. Equity futures for New York’s S&P500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones indexes rose as much as half a percent  . “At the end of the day, all these circumstances, including trade wars, have been in play for a while, and the market reacts sharply from time to time,” said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners. But Savary cautioned against pushing the equity rally too far: “The framework is set: there is monetary policy tightening, less liquidity, more geopolitical uncertainty and an economic situation which in Europe at least we need to be more cautious about.” The slightly improved mood lifted yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes above 2.9022 percent, just off 2-1/2-week lows around 2.88 percent. German yields also inched marginally higher. Euro zone yields were pushed lower this week on the back of trade tensions, as well as slowing growth momentum across the bloc and a central bank that has pushed back the timing of its first interest rate rise in this cycle by several months. That has also hit the euro, which slipped 0.25 percent to the dollar, staying near two-week lows of $1.1528 hit after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi called for a patient approach to monetary policy. Draghi spoke at a banking forum in Sintra, Portugal, where he is due to appear again on Wednesday alongside Fed chair Jerome Powell, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe. Britain’s pound struggled near a seven-month low of $1.3151 ahead of a crucial vote in parliament over the country’s European Union withdrawal process. As the dollar’s rally stalled, emerging currencies such as the Mexican peso and South African rand won some reprieve. But ING analysts told clients that “with the risk to trade firmly in place, we don’t look for a material and long lasting rebound in higher beta and emerging market currencies”. An early rebound in crude and copper also faded, though Brent futures managed to stay above $75 a barrel before a meeting of the OPEC producers group. OPEC member Iran has said a deal to raise oil output is unlikely. While most metals prices bounced, copper slipped back to three-week lows after data showed supply remained abundant. U.S. soybean futures managed only a 0.3 percent rise from decade-lows hit on fears of Chinese import tariffs.

2018-06-20,"THOOTHUKUDI, India, June 20 (Reuters) - Vedanta Ltd said on Wednesday a sulphuric acid leak from a tank at its southern Indian copper smelter was severe and inaction could lead to serious environmental consequences. The district administration had said on Sunday the leak was minor, and steps were being taken to empty the storage tanks as a safety precaution. “There is a severe leakage in the pipe flanges and ... the pipe flanges are submerged in the acid pool collected in the dykes around the acid storage tank,” the company said in a petition to the Madras high court. Vedanta, the Indian subsidiary of London-listed Vedanta Resources, said it sought a limited reconnection of the electricity supply for maintenance to guard against a potential loss of life and damage to air and ground water. “There is a grave risk and danger as there are other tanks and there are flammable chemicals and materials within the plant area,” it said. However, the district’s top administrative official Sandeep Nanduri stuck to the earlier view that the leak was minor. “That is their version, and this is ours. However, we are completely evacuating the sulphuric acid from all tanks as a safety precaution,” said Nanduri. The Tamil Nadu state government ordered a permanent closure of the plant and disconnected the power supply last month following protests that turned violent and culminated in the police opening fire on protesters, killing 13 of them. The protesters demanded a permanent shutdown of the plant, which they said was causing air and water pollution. Locals and activists see the smelter as a risk to fisheries. Vedanta says the protests are based on false notions. Vedanta also said it was unable to meet government officials because of the tense situation prevailing after the protests. A senior state minister told Reuters in an interview early this month that there was “no question” of engaging with the company, and the plant will remain shut. The smelter, which has been shut for about three months, annually produces about a million tonnes of sulphuric acid, a corrosive byproduct of copper smelting used as a raw material by the fertiliser industry. It accounted for over a third of India’s refined copper production, and employed over 3,000 people. The company plans to appeal the government’s move to shut the plant.

2018-06-20,"(Adds details, quotes) By Alex Lawler and Rania El Gamal VIENNA, June 20 (Reuters) - India, the world’s third-biggest oil consumer and importer, on Wednesday urged OPEC nations to fill a supply gap and ensure sustainable oil prices as politics affect the output of some producers. The world faces likely lower oil exports from Iran, OPEC’s third-biggest producer, after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear accord with a vow to renew sanctions against Tehran. India is Iran’s biggest oil client after China. “Political conditions, sometimes internal and sometimes external, result in reduced output of some countries. We expect from OPEC and its members a commitment to step in (and) more than fill the gap to ensure sustainable prices,” Indian oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said at a seminar in Vienna. He said currently high oil prices dent the economic development of many countries. “The already fragile world economic growth will be at threat if oil prices persist at these levels. My fear is – this will lead to energy poverty in many parts of the world,” he said. New Delhi, which imports about 80 percent of its crude oil needs, has been urging responsible oil pricing that balances the interests of producers and consumers and supports the global economy. Pradhan said India does not support the prevailing high price. “These prices are creating stress throughout global economy, as it is giving pain to us in India,” he said. India’s trade deficit in May widened to $14.62 billion, the highest in four months, driven mainly by a 50 percent surge in the country’s oil import bill. “Globally, crude prices have gone beyond the threshold which can be sustained by the world, particularly countries like India which is a key driver of world economy,” he said. India’s footprint in global energy markets will increase “materially” from 2018 to 2040, making it the largest growth market for global energy, BP Plc said in its energy outlook report in February. Pradhan urged OPEC producers to maintain supply equilibrium. “It is in the interests of producers that other economies keep growing steadily and rapidly so as to ensure growing energy markets for themselves. This is the key to energy sustainability.” (Writing by Nidhi Verma in New Delhi; editing by Dale Hudson and Jason Neely)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-opec-india/update-1-energy-guzzler-india-urges-opec-to-tackle-high-oil-prices-idUKL8N1TM2L6,20 Jun 2018,"India, the world's third-biggest

2018-06-20,"NEW YORK, June 20 (Reuters) - Oil markets are bracing for a reshuffle of global trade flows as China threatens to impose tit-for-tat tariffs on imports of U.S. energy products, including crude. China, which has bought an average 330,000 barrels per day (bpd) of U.S. crude oil this year, is threatening to place a 25 percent tariff on various U.S. commodity exports, including crude oil, although it is so far unclear when such a measure would come in place. The decision came in response to U.S. President Donald Trump saying he was pushing ahead with hefty tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports. And it triggered an aggressive response by Trump, who on Monday threatened to slap a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods in addition to the import duties previously announced. The tariffs could restrict the flow of U.S. barrels going to China - a business now worth almost $1 billion per month An import duty would make U.S. oil less competitive than other crudes, almost certainly resulting in a sharp fall of Chinese purchases, forcing U.S. oil firms to find other buyers. In the first three months of this year, U.S. crude made up around 5 percent of China’s total crude imports, according to Chinese customs data. “It’ll take the (U.S. oil) industry a few months to find new outlets,” said Scott Shelton, a broker at ICAP in Durham, adding that U.S. crude flows to Europe and the Mediterranean will likely pick up. Outside China, however, WTI remains at a $10 per barrel discount to Brent CL-LCO1=R. Many traders expect this discount to widen further should the flow of U.S. oil to China slow, meaning that other producers would have to deal with high volumes of cheap American oil becoming available in other big markets, including Europe. China, in turn, is likely to replace the U.S. oil with increased purchases from top suppliers Russia and Saudi Arabia. Saudi and Russia are already pushing for an increase in production at a meeting of The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) this week. “I think it would create a carousel affect where China then buys more alternate grades and other importers buy more U.S. grades,” a trader with a global merchant said. The United States, where oil production C-OUT-T-EIA has risen by almost a third in the last two years to a weekly record of 10.9 million bpd C-OUT-T-EIA, relies heavily on exports to maintain market balance. Exports surged to an unprecedented 1.76 million bpd in April from 1.67 million bpd in March. European countries, including Italy and the Netherlands, accounted for the bulk of the increase in April U.S. crude exports. Some traders expect U.S. barrels to get trapped if the dispute between the world’s two biggest economies turns into a fully blown trade war, which in turn would force own the price of U.S. crude even further. “There is going to be a sales lull that will keep these barrels trapped and the widening of the spread that we see will persist and get worse before it gets better,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. For China, the world’s biggest importer of crude oil, relatively higher Brent prices means oil would become more expensive. This would put Chinese refiners at a disadvantage, said John Coleman, senior analyst of North American crude markets at Wood Mackenzie. As the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing heats up, the world’s top oil producers are set to gather in Vienna, Austria, on June 22 to set global output strategy. Producer group OPEC, which is effectively led by Saudi Arabia, has been withholding supplies since 2017 to prop up prices together with non-OPEC members like top producer Russia Russia and Saudi Arabia are both pushing for an increase in output to make up for losses in supplies in Venezuela as well as looming U.S. sanctions against Iran. Russia’s flagship Urals crude oil is one of the grades preferred by China’s independent refiners, known as teapots. Middle East flows to Asian countries such as India have also picked up over the past two months as Brent’s premium over the Dubai benchmark DUB-EFS-1M has widened. Middle East light grades such as Murban, therefore, would now have an even easier time finding a home in China, traders said. Overall, however, traders do not expect serious supply shortfalls to result from Chinese crude tariffs against the United States. “The world’s an awfully big place, consuming an awful lot of oil, so you may not have it that much harder for to go elsewhere,” said Spencer Dale, chief economist at oil major BP. “You may see some differences in ... oil flows (but) I don’t see it, at the moment, as a source of major disruption ... Some of that oil which would’ve been supplied by U.S. into China will go elsewhere,” he added. Reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar and Ayenat Mersie in NEW

2018-06-20,"* MSCI World index snaps 5-day losing streak as Asia bounces * China markets reverse losses on indications of policy support * European shares open higher, Wall Street likely to rise * Tentative gains on emerging currencies, stocks (Updates throughout, changes dateline, byline) By Sujata Rao LONDON, June 20 (Reuters) - World stocks steadied near three-week lows on Wednesday and Chinese markets bounced after recent sharp falls as expectations grew that policy stimulus by Beijing could temper some of the impact from an escalating Sino-U.S. trade conflict. The dollar too eased off 11-month highs against a currency basket,  Wall Street looked set for a stronger opening and MSCI’s all-country equity index snapped a five-day run of losses, rising 0.3 percent. Its rebound was fuelled by a bounce of almost one percent in MSCI’s non-Japan Asian shares off 6-1/2-month lows , following gains in Hong Kong, Seoul and mainland Chinese indexes  . Assets perceived to be safe, such as the yen, Swiss franc and the government bonds of Germany and the United States, took a step back after hefty recent rallies. “I suspect safe-havens such as Bunds and Treasuries could be put to the test as risk sentiment shows signs of stabilising,” Commerzbank strategist Rainer Guntermann said. One catalyst appeared to be a paper from China’s central bank which suggested cutting banks’ reserve requirement ratios (RRR), which would boost market liquidity and loosen monetary conditions. Analysts said an RRR cut appeared now to be a matter of time. The central bank also fixed the yuan’s exchange rate a touch higher against the dollar, after the currency posted its biggest daily loss in 1-1/2 years. However, worries of a fully fledged trade war between the two biggest world economies remain. Washington is threatening tariffs on $200 billion more of Chinese goods and a White House trade adviser said Beijing was underestimating President Donald Trump’s resolve to impose more tariffs. An escalation in tit-for-tat tariffs would hit hard world growth, company profits and price stability at a time when several big central banks, notably U.S. Federal Reserve, are in policy tightening mode. The Asian equity gains encouraged European bourses to open higher, with a pan-European index up 0.6 percent after slumping on Tuesday to two-month lows. However, an index of auto shares, a sector highly vulnerable to U.S. tariffs, stayed in negative territory. Equity futures for New York’s S&P500 index rose 0.25 percent a day after U.S. stocks fell sharply. “At the end of the day, all these circumstances, including trade wars, have been in play for a while, and the market reacts sharply from time to time,” said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners. He cautioned however against pushing the equity rally too far: “The framework is set: there is monetary policy tightening, less liquidity, more geo-political uncertainty and an economic situation which in Europe at least we need to be more cautious about.” As the bid for safety abated, yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose above 2.9022 percent after touching 2-1/2-week low around 2.88 percent and German yields also inched higher. Euro zone yields have been pushed lower almost across the board this week, on back of the trade tensions but also on slowing growth momentum across the bloc and a central bank which has pushed back the timing of its first interest rate rise in this cycle by several months. All that has also hit the euro which slipped 0.2 percent to the dollar, staying near two-week lows of $1.1528 hit after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi called on Tuesday for a patient approach to monetary policy. Draghi had been speaking at a banking forum in Sintra, Portugal, where he is due to appear again on Wednesday alongside Fed chair Jerome Powell, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe. Britain’s pound too was struggling near a seven-month low of $1.3151 ahead of a crucial vote in parliament over the country’s European Union withdrawal process. However as the dollar’s rally stalled, emerging currencies such as Mexican peso Taiwan dollar and the South African rand won some reprieve. ING analysts told clients however that “with the risk to trade firmly in place, we don’t look for a material and long lasting rebound in higher beta and emerging market currencies.” Commodity and crude prices rose, with Brent futures up 0.6 percent back above $75 a barrel before a meeting this week of the OPEC producers group. OPEC member Iran has said a deal to raise oil output is unlikely. Copper, a key barometer of world growth, rebounded from three-week lows as did other metals such as nickel and zinc. Chinese soymeal futures, which hit two-year highs on Tuesday on fears of curbs or tariffs on U.S. soybean imports, slipped half a percent Reporting by Sujata Rao; additional reporting by Dhara

2018-06-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hyundai (005380.KS) agreed a deal with Audi (NSUG.DE) on Wednesday to collaborate on hydrogen car technology, hoping to boost an energy segment that has lagged behind battery electric vehicles.  The South Korean firm wants to increase the uptake of hydrogen cars, which are propelled by electricity generated by fuel cells but have been held back by a lack of infrastructure and the push for battery electric vehicles by the likes of Tesla (TSLA.O).  The pair will be able to access each other’s intellectual property and share components, including any new parts developed by Audi, which is responsible for hydrogen fuel cell technology in the Volkswagen Group (VOWG_p.DE), the world’s biggest car seller. Hyundai hopes that the move will create greater demand for vehicles such as its ix35 model and bring down costs to make the technology profitable.   “We want to provide to our component suppliers more chance and we want to have competition between component suppliers,” Sae Hoon Kim, the head of Hyundai’s R&D fuel cell group, told Reuters in an interview in London.  “We also want to make them to have competition with other suppliers, and that competition will bring down the cost.” Carmakers such as Toyota have touted the benefits of hydrogen vehicles, which take less time to refuel than the recharge times of battery electric cars, but are expensive and suffer from a lack of refuelling stations. Many carmakers are focusing on battery electric vehicles, which can take between half an hour and half a day to recharge, but are increasingly able to use a growing network of charging points. Auto firms are teaming up to share the cost of developing greener technologies to replace combustion engines as regulators around the world crack down on emissions. GM and Honda have a partnership to jointly develop electric vehicles with hydrogen fuel cells that are expected to go on sale in 2020, while BMW is working with Toyota.  Kim said that a toughening of European Union carbon emission limits in 2025 would create a need for more hydrogen cars. Hyundai sold 200 such models last year and expects to sell thousands this year, but Kim said profitability was still far off.  “100,000 or 300,000 vehicles per year per company, when that comes, I think we can make money,” he said.

2018-06-20,"PARIS, June 20 (Reuters) - France will allow gas utility Engie to sell part of the main French gas grid, GRTgaz, to private investors, according to a planned parliamentary bill, as the government eyes a series of possible privatisations to boost the economy. The gas grid, which manages most French gas pipelines and storage sites, is currently 75 percent owned by Engie, with the remaining 25 percent owned by state investor Caisse des Depots and insurer CNP. The new law will allow the state-controlled investors to jointly hold only a majority stake in GRTgaz, rather than the entire capital, according to a version of the bill cited by top French court Conseil d’Etat. A separate, smaller French gas grid company in the southwest of the country, TIGF, is controlled by Italy’s Snam, Europe’s biggest pipeline operator, which has a strategic alliance with Belgium’s Fluxys.

Korea exchange hacked By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, June 20 (Reuters) - Asian stock markets bounced on Wednesday following a wobbly morning session that highlighted the lingering anxiety and uncertainty surrounding a heated trade dispute between China and the United States. Markets in Europe and the U.S. looked set to follow Asia higher. S&P 500 futures were 0.2 percent higher and Dow Jones futures gained 0.5 percent. Financial spreadbetters expected London’s FTSE to open 15 points higher, Frankfurt’s DAX 5 points up and Paris’ CAC 13 points higher. In Asia, bargain hunters turned out to pick up shares on the cheap after the previous day’s rout. The MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan jumped 1 percent, after Tuesday’s 2.1 percent tumble, supported by an afternoon rebound in Chinese shares. Japan’s Nikkei was up 1.2 percent after falling into negative territory earlier in the day. South Korea’s KOSPI rose 1 percent. In China, markets turned losses into gains as investors appeared to take heart from indications of government support. The Shanghai Composite Index was 0.5 percent higher a day after falling 3.8 percent to a two-year low. China’s blue-chip CSI300 index gained 0.6 percent, and the Shenzhen Composite Index rose 1.4 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was 1.1 percent higher after closing down 2.8 percent on Tuesday. The China Enterprises Index reversed losses from the morning session, rising 0.4 percent. In a working paper on Tuesday, China’s central bank said the country should cut banks’ reserve requirement ratios (RRR) to boost market liquidity, highlighting concerns over trade, a day after the central bank governor urged investors to remain calm. “It is fair to say an RRR (cut) seems imminent ... the only question is the magnitude,” Sue Trinh, head of Asia FX Strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Hong Kong said in a note. An apparent bias toward looser policy “runs counter to the regional bias toward higher rates to protect currency downside,” she said, adding that growing policy divergence indicates room for the onshore and offshore yuan to depreciate. The bounce in share markets comes despite trade tensions between the United States and China showing few signs of easing. On Tuesday, a White House trade adviser said that Beijing has underestimated the U.S. president’s resolve to impose more tariffs. Washington threatened on Monday to impose a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods after Beijing decided to raise tariffs on $50 billion in U.S. goods, in response to similar tariffs on Chinese goods announced Friday. Nevertheless, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 2.9022 percent on Wednesday afternoon after earlier falling to 2.8820. The two-year yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was at 2.5535 percent. AUSTRALIA CATCH-UP RALLY Australian stocks, which saw strong buying throughout the day, ended 1.2 percent higher, supported by a weak local dollar. The Aussie dollar rose 0.2 percent after hitting a one-year low on Tuesday. A more attractive dividend proposition and a weaker Australian dollar have made the market more alluring to overseas investors, said Ryan Felsman, a senior economist at CommSec. “Last year the Aussie market was only up 7 percent relative to the US at 25 percent. We didn’t get the sugar hit from the corporate tax plan, so there’s a bit of catch-up in play as well,” he said. The US dollar was slightly stronger against the yen, rising 0.05 percent to 110.10. The euro was 0.1 percent lower at $1.1576, while the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was flat at 95.096.

2018-06-20,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - China’s proposed tariffs on U.S. petroleum imports, part of a mounting trade war between the two countries, would crimp sales to the shale industry’s largest customer, adding new pressure on U.S. crude prices, energy executives and analysts said in interviews this week. China has said it would slap a 25 percent tariff on imports of U.S. crude, natural gas and coal on July 6 if Washington went ahead, as planned, with its own tariffs on Chinese goods that day.  Energy would be added for the first time to a burgeoning trade dispute that has hit imports of Chinese metals and solar panels, and exports of U.S. medical equipment and soybeans. Targeting petroleum puts the Trump administration’s “energy dominance” agenda in Beijing’s cross-hairs as U.S. shale has grabbed share from Middle East suppliers in Asia.  China is the largest customer for U.S. crude, importing about 363,000 barrels a day in the six months ended in March. Thomson Reuters shipping data shows those exports have increased since, rising to an expected 450,000 bpd in July.  “It is going to hurt everyone for the short term,” said Ron Gasser, vice president at Mammoth Exploration, a west Texas shale producer. While U.S. crude will continue flowing to market even with tariffs, “it’ll force you to put your oil somewhere else, and it’ll cost you more” to line up other buyers.   U.S. oil exports have steadily grown since the four-decade-old ban on crude exports was lifted at the end of 2015.  China’s tariff threat caught U.S. producers off guard because it had been discussing buying more U.S. energy and agricultural products to reduce its $375 billion trade surplus with the United States. The levies could boost suppliers of West African crude at the expense of U.S. exports. The tariffs are “creating a whole new set of uncertainties on top of what’s already there,” Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of consultancy IHS Markit, said on Tuesday as he arrived in Vienna to attend this week’s OPEC’s International Seminar.   On Friday, OPEC oil ministers will gather to consider sharply increasing the group’s production this year, a move advanced forth by Saudi Arabia and Russia. The change is opposed by members Algeria, Iran, Iraq and Venezuela. The United States also recently set new sanctions on Iran’s petroleum industry, which is expected to disrupt oil flows.  “The global oil industry didn’t really worry or think about trade issues. Now, trade issues are moving really pretty fast up the agenda,” said Yergin.   The impact likely would be temporary as U.S. oil becomes less attractive to Chinese buyers. But the tit-for-tat expansion of tariffs has U.S. oil industry officials and politicians calling on the Trump administration to move cautiously.  The American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers Association on Tuesday called on the president “to work with China - and all nations - to reduce barriers to competition rather than promote them.” U.S. Senator Michael Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, a coal and oil producing state, wants the administration to be “wary of how these retaliatory measures from China could seriously impact the industry,” spokesman Max D’Onofrio said on Monday.  In coal country, there are worries the trade war could harm exports, said Steve Roberts, president of the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce. “China is an enormously important trading partner,” he said. Some U.S. producers said growing demand for U.S. energy would overcome the impact of China’s tariffs just as higher oil prices this year have not slowed the global thirst for oil and natural gas. Gary C. Evans, chief executive of shale producer Energy Hunter Resources, called the tariffs “a lot of saber rattling” that will not hurt exports of U.S. crude oil or liquefied natural gas, the latter a fuel that China has not included on its list of products facing a tariff.    “Crude oil is a fungible global commodity,” Evans said. “Without growing U.S. crude supply and exports, global prices could today be multiples higher than they currently are.” Reporting by Collin Eaton and Liz Hampton in Houston and Ernest Scheyder in Vienna; additional reporting by Valerie Volcovici in Washington and Devika Krishna Kumar; Writing by Gary McWilliams; Editing by Richard Chang",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-shale/u-s-shale-producers-warn-chinese-tariffs-would-hit-energy-exports-idUKL1N1TL13A,20 Jun 2018,"China's proposed tariffs on

China’s blue-chip CSI300 index was 0.5 percent lower after briefly flirting with gains, and the Shenzhen Composite Index was flat at midday. The extended sell-off in China comes despite indications that the country’s central bank could move to cut banks’ reserve requirement ratios (RRR) to boost market liquidity, highlighting concerns over trade. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) recommended the move in working paper on Tuesday. “It is fair to say an RRR (cut) seems imminent ... the only question is the magnitude,” Sue Trinh, head of Asia FX Strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Hong Kong said in a note.

2018-06-20,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Global energy trader Vitol kicked off the planned A$5 billion ($3.7 billion) float of its Australian refinery and fuel supply network Viva Energy on Wednesday, in what would be the country’s biggest initial public offering in four years. The sale of the unit, which supplies about a quarter of Australia’s fuel, is Vitol’s second IPO this year after the London listing of an African fuel business and is expected to raise up to A$3 billion for the energy trader and its partners, who will retain a 40 to 50 percent stake. It comes amid a shake-up of Australia’s petrol retailing, with BP looking to take over top grocer Woolworths’ petrol stations and Caltex Australia ditching its franchise model to run its own operations. Vitol SA [VITOLV.UL] is looking to cash in on the $2.6 billion purchase in 2014 of Royal Dutch Shell’s refinery in Geelong near Melbourne and a network of around 1,165 petrol stations. It has since spent over A$1 billion improving the business, including buying Shell’s jet fuel operations. Viva Energy is expected to list on the Australian Stock Exchange on July 13 with an indicative market capitalization of around A$5 billion, according to the IPO documents. Institutional investors have already committed to buy about A$1.2 billion worth of shares, which would be half the stock on offer at the bottom end of the offer price range, a person close to the process said. The IPO pricing range looked reasonable for a business likely to benefit from demand for premium quality fuels, said Nikko Asset Management portfolio manager Tim Johnston. “The volume outlook for the industry is relatively muted but extremely stable, and it’s also an industry that’s proven to have a high degree of pricing power,” he said. Viva’s earnings grew 19 percent between 2015 and 2017, Chairman Robert Hill said in the prospectus. “We have plans for the continued expansion of our retail network and see opportunities to benefit from growth in key commercial sectors,” Hill said. Gasoline sales, which make up about 25 percent of the business, are expected to hold steady or grow only slightly, with car fuel efficiency gains being offset by population growth and rising vehicle ownership, Viva Chief Executive Scott Wyatt told reporters on a conference call. However the company sees good prospects in aviation fuel,  with strong growth in air travel, especially with Chinese airlines coming into Australia and Viva Energy having pipelines into the country’s two fastest growing airports — Sydney and Melbourne. The float is being priced at between A$2.50 and A$2.65 a share, or between 13.1 and 13.9 times forecast net profit for the year to June 2019. Its closest listed rival, Caltex, is trading on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 13.2, according to Thomson Reuters data. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank and UBS are running the IPO. The Viva sale follows Vitol’s $2.6 billion London listing of its African business Vivo Energy in May, although an IPO of its European oil products venture was scrapped in April due to poor market conditions. Vivo Energy’s shares have dropped 16 percent from their offer price of 165 pence since listing on May 4, against a flat broader market.

2018-06-20,"SHANGHAI, June 20 (Reuters) - Stocks in Asia rebounded from recent losses on Wednesday as investors sought bargains, a day after the spectre of a U.S.-China trade war rattled global markets, but significant uncertainty around the trade outlook is capping gains. Japan’s Nikkei was 0.1 percent higher after earlier falling into negative territory. South Korea’s KOSPI rose 1 percent. In China, the Shanghai Composite Index was down 0.3 percent in early trade, a day after falling 3.8 percent. Wednesday’s fall came despite 30 listed firms announcing share purchase plans by major shareholders, and state media expressing confidence in the country’s stock markets. China’s blue-chip CSI300 index was 0.2 percent lower after briefly flirting with gains, and the Shenzhen Composite Index was up 0.1 percent. “U.S.-China trade frictions remain broadly negative for the market and for investor sentiment, and are likely to weigh on forward earnings given the ongoing uncertainties coupled with a high base effect when compared with last year’s performance,” said Raymond Ma, portfolio manager at Fidelity International. In contrast, Australian stocks gained 0.8 percent, supported by weakness in the Australian dollar. The Aussie dollar was up 0.2 percent after hitting a one-year low on Tuesday. Strength in Australian shares continued to support MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan , which rose 0.4 percent. Investors in cryptocurrencies were also hit by losses after South Korean virtual currency exchange Bithumb said it had been hacked and 35 billion won worth of virtual currency held at the exchange was stolen. Bitcoin was 1.8 percent lower at $6,614.39. Weakening appetite for risk pushed the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes lower to 2.8949 percent, after earlier rising to 2.9 percent. The two-year yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was at 2.5493 percent after earlier touching 2.5530 percent. S&P 500 futures were flat after major U.S. indexes closed lower Tuesday. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China showed few signs of easing after a White House trade adviser said on Tuesday that China has underestimated the U.S. president’s resolve to impose more tariffs. Washington threatened on Monday to impose a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods after Beijing decided to raise tariffs on $50 billion in U.S. goods, in response to similar tariffs on Chinese goods announced Friday. The dollar was mostly flat against the yen, rising 0.07 percent against to 110.12, still some distance from its high this year of 113.38 on January 8. The euro was down a hair at $1.1581, while the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was barely lower at 95.040. U.S. crude rose 0.4 percent to $65.31 a barrel. But ANZ analysts said in a note that rising trade tensions and disagreement within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which meets on Friday, are likely to weigh on oil prices on Wednesday. Iran said on Tuesday that OPEC was unlikely to reach a deal on oil output this week. Gold was mostly flat after falling near six-month lows Tuesday on a strong dollar.

2018-06-20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chinese manufacturer JinkoSolar Holding Co Ltd expects to start manufacturing solar panels at a new factory in Jacksonville, Florida, by the fourth quarter, and production will not be affected by the latest round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese products, a company executive said on Tuesday. The administration of President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to slap a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods in addition to import duties previously announced on $50 billion in goods, deepening a trade conflict that has hit financial markets and has led Beijing to vow a firm response. Jeff Juger, business development director of JinkoSolar, said the $50 billion in tariffs on Chinese products “do not impact our operation in Florida because all the cells we’re going to import (to the plant) come from Malaysia.”    And to deal with tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on imported solar panels earlier this year, Juger said the Florida plant would take advantage of an exemption that allows U.S. manufacturers to import 2.5 gigawatts of tariff-free cells for use in manufacturing solar modules at American plants.     “The 2.5 gigawatt exemption gives us quite a bit of headroom to import tariff-free cells,” he said on a panel at the Renewable Energy Finance Forum in New York.     Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the conference, Juger said JinkoSolar has also applied for an exclusion to the cell import tariffs that would allow it to import a large-format solar cell it makes in Malaysia for use in building solar modules at its Florida factory.     He said he is hopeful the administration will grant the exemption because JinkoSolar is the only manufacturer in the world that makes the cell in question. “If the government grants that exclusion request and lets us import these cells, it will allow us to further scale up the factory in Florida,” he said.     The Jacksonville factory will employ more than 200 workers, he said, adding that coping with tariffs and trade issues has been part of JinkoSolar’s business for years.     “We just have to persevere no matter what the circumstances,” Juger said. “The decision to invest in the Florida factory is a testament to our commitment to the U.S. market.” (This version of the story, in fifth paragraph corrects to 2.5 gigawatt instead of gigabyte; in paragraph 6 corrects “makes in Malaysia” instead of in China; in paragraph 7 corrects “the cell in question” instead of “the panel in question”) Reporting by Dave Gregorio in New York; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Matthew Lewis",https://uk.reuters.com/article/jinkosolar-florida-factory/corrected-chinas-jinko-to-produce-solar-panels-in-florida-by-4th-qtr-despite-tariffs-idUKL8N1TL69X,20 Jun 2018,"Chinese manufacturer

2018-06-20,"OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn on Tuesday won a battle for control of SandRidge Energy, taking five seats on the board of the U.S. shale producer that he wants to sell.  Shareholders elected four of Icahn’s seven-person slate and two nominees put forth by the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma oil and gas company, according to a preliminary tally, with another position deemed too close to immediately call.  The company later said it struck an agreement with the investor to expand the board to eight members, appointing an existing director and a fifth Icahn nominee.   “We look forward to working together in a constructive manner as we execute our plan and continue our strategic review process to maximize value for all SandRidge shareholders,” it said.   The company’s poison pill and executive compensation plan were rejected by shareholders, another victory for Icahn, who had urged a “no” vote for both. Icahn, who owns a 13.6 percent stake in the company, launched a fight for control of the board this year, arguing directors overpaid company executives, signed off on a costly deal that was later withdrawn and failed to pursue a February takeover proposal. Icahn did not reply to a request for comment and a representative of the billionaire investor attending the meeting declined to comment.  SandRidge’s former chief executive and finance chief were ousted earlier this year as Icahn criticized management, and its board said it would conduct a strategic review that included a sale of some or all of the company.  The company expanded its board, offering two new seats on it to the billionaire investor, but Icahn said he did not trust the existing board to manage a sale and nominated his own slate to replace them.    SandRidge had argued Icahn wants to gain control of the company on the cheap by disrupting its directors’ review of a sale of assets or the entire company.  Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Co, two firms that issue proxy recommendations, each backed four of SandRidge’s board nominees. Both urged holders to vote against the company’s poison pill and its executive compensation plan.  Icahn last year challenged SandRidge’s $746 million deal for rival Bonanza Creek Energy Inc, forcing it to back away from a purchase he called too expensive and designed to benefit the company’s management at the expense of shareholders.  Shareholders elected Jonathan Christodoro, John Lipinski, Bob Alexander and Randolph Read from Icahn’s slate. They also approved existing SandRidge directors Sylvia Barnes and William Griffin Jr. The settlement added Icahn nominee Jonathan Frates and existing director David Kornder.

2018-06-20,"* Markets eyeing Jun. 22 OPEC meeting * Saudi Arabia, Russia pushing for modest output increase * Other OPEC-members like Iran resist increase in supply * Escalating U.S./China trade dispute keeps markets on edge By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, June 20 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose in early Asian trading on Wednesday, supported by a drop in U.S. commercial crude inventories reported by the American Petroleum Institute (API). U.S. crude inventories fell by 3 million barrels in the week to June 15 to 430.6 million barrels, according to the weekly API report published on Tuesday. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $75.30 per barrel at 0008 GMT, up 22 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $65.34 a barrel, up 27 cents, or 0.4 percent. Looming large over markets, however, was a June 22 meeting in Vienna of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), together with some other producers including Russia, to discuss forward supply policy. De-facto OPEC leader and top crude exporter Saudi Arabia as well as Russia, which is not a member of the cartel but the world’s biggest oil producer, are pushing for looser supply controls, which were introduced in 2017 to prop up prices. Other OPEC-members, including Iran, are against such a move, fearing a sharp slump in prices. “Saudi Arabia and Russia continued to push for a relaxation in production constraints, going against many other members wishes,” ANZ bank said on Wednesday. “Iran rejected a potential compromise, saying it won’t support even a small increase in oil production. This puts Saudi Arabia in a tough position, as unanimity is needed for any accord to be reached,” it added. Jack Allardyce, oil and gas research analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, said he had the “expectation that supply quotas will be increased, but probably more in line with the smaller range being quoted (300,000-600,000 barrels per day) given the lack of consensus amongst OPEC members.” Allardyce said “we could see this knocking $5 per barrel off Brent and perhaps squeezing the WTI discount a little.” Markets were also anxiously watching trade tensions between the United States and China, in which both sides have threatened to impose stiff duties on each other’s export products, including U.S. crude oil. A 25 percent tariff on U.S. crude oil imports, as threatened by China in retaliation for duties Washington has announced but not yet implemented against Chinese products, would make American crude uncompetitive in China versus other supplies. This would almost certainly lead to a sharp drop-off in Chinese purchases of U.S. crude, which have boomed in the last two years to a business now worth around $1 billion per month.
