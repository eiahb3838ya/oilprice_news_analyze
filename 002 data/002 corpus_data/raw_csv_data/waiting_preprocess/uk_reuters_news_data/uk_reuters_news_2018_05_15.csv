2018-05-15,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on Iran’s central bank governor and an Iraq-based bank for “moving millions of dollars” for Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guard, as Washington seeks to cut off funding it says Tehran is using to fund militant activities overseas. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin accused bank chief Valiollah Seif of covertly funnelling money on behalf of the revolutionary guard’s external arm, Quds Force (IRGC-QF), through Al-Bilad Islamic Bank “to enrich and support the violent and radical agenda of Hezbollah.” The move cuts off Iran’s use of a critical banking network, he said. The United States classifies Lebanon’s Shi’ite Muslim movement Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, as a terrorist organisation. “It is appalling, but not surprising, that Iran’s senior-most banking official would conspire with the IRGC-QF to facilitate funding of terror groups like Hezbollah, and it undermines any credibility he could claim in protecting the integrity of the institution as a central bank governor,” Mnuchin said in a statement. Speaking in Brussels, Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif called the sanctions against Seif illegal. The U.S. Treasury also blacklisted Ali Tarzali, assistant director of the international department of Iran’s central bank, and the chairman of Al-Bilad Islamic Bank, Aras Habib. It said Habib had a history of smuggling money to Iranian-backed Iraqi groups and “enabled the IRGC-QF’s exploitation of Iraq’s banking sector to move funds from Tehran to Hezbollah, jeopardizing the integrity of the Iraqi financial system.”  The department said the sanctions would not immediately affect central bank transactions. It said, however, that sanctions being reimposed after the withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear deal would affect certain U.S. dollar transactions by the central bank starting from Aug. 7, 2018. Last week, two days after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions against six individuals and three companies it said were funnelling millions of dollars to the IRGC-QF. British, French and German foreign ministers met in  Brussels on Tuesday to try to find a way to save the nuclear deal without the United States, but appeared hard-pressed over how their companies could continue doing business with Iran once Washington begins to reimpose sanctions. The IRGC is by far Iran’s most powerful security organisation and has control over large stakes in Iran’s economy and huge influence in its political system. The Quds Force is an elite unit in charge of the IRGC overseas operations.

2018-05-15,"(Reuters) - The European Union’s top diplomat said on Tuesday Communist-run Cuba could help broker fresh dialogue between the government and opposition in Venezuela, despite Havana’s frequent assurances the crisis afflicting its leftist ally was a sovereign matter. Federica Mogherini made the comments at a news conference in Brussels after hosting the EU’s first “joint council” with Cuba since the bloc dropped all sanctions on the island and agreed on a political framework within which to strengthen ties.  The EU has said it is now Cuba’s top trade and investment partner, and arguably plays a bigger role than traditional allies like Venezuela or Russia as the island implements market reforms to its centrally-planned economy. Analysts say the EU has also taken advantage of U.S. indifference or a diplomatic vacuum, as the Trump administration backtracks on a fragile detente with Cuba.  “I personally believe that Cuba could play a positive role in trying to avoid further negative developments (in Venezuela) and trying to re-open and negotiate a political solution and dialogue,” Mogherini told joint news conference with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez. Venezuela will hold a presidential election on May 20 that the opposition coalition is boycotting, saying it is a farce intended to legitimize a “dictatorship” led by President Nicolas Maduro. The Lima Group of largely Latin American nations on Monday urged the Venezuelan government to suspend the vote, calling the process “illegitimate and lacking in credibility.” Cuba has played the role of broker in several disputes in recent years, notably hosting peace talks between the Colombian government and Marxist rebel groups it has been at war with for five decades.  The Cuban government has stood steadfast by Venezuela, denouncing foreign interference in its internal affairs, despite a sharp decline in subsidized Venezuelan oil shipments amid the OPEC nation’s economic crisis.   The EU has sent several high-level delegations to Cuba this year. First Mogherini visited, then a delegation from the European Investment Bank. The bloc signed on Tuesday an agreement with Cuba to invest 18 million euros to help its achieve its ambitious goals in terms of developing renewable energy on the island. The EU has said it will sign cooperation agreements worth 49 million euros in total.

2018-05-15,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices settled a shade firmer after retreating from multi-year highs hit early in the day on Tuesday, supported by concerns that U.S. sanctions on Iran are likely to restrict crude exports from one of the biggest producers in the Middle East. Brent crude oil LCOc1 settled at $78.43 a barrel, up 20 cents, or 0.3 percent, after reaching an intraday peak of $79.47 a barrel, up $1.24 and its highest since November 2014.  U.S. light crude CLc1 closed 35 cents, or 0.5 percent, higher at $71.31 a barrel, also not far off the day’s peak at $71.92, its highest since November 2014.  Prices pulled back in post-settlement trade after an industry organization said U.S. crude stockpiles built unexpectedly last week. U.S. crude dropped 6 cents to $70.90 a barrel, while Brent fell 22 cents to $78.01.  Trade group the American Petroleum Institute said crude stockpiles rose nearly 5 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations for a 763,000-barrel draw. [API/S] Official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. EDT [1430 GMT]. The difference between the two benchmarks briefly widened to more than $8 a barrel, the widest gap since April 2015, reflecting surging U.S. crude supplies and a greater geopolitical risk to Brent-based crudes.  “U.S. oil prices have flip-flopped on a strong dollar,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “Brent is pricing in the idea that all the risk to supplies is overseas - there’s a concern that all the supplies that are tight in Europe are only going to get tighter.” World oil prices have surged more than 70 percent over the last year as demand has risen sharply while production has been restricted by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, and other producers, including Russia. The United States has announced it will impose sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme, raising fears that markets will face shortages later this year when trade restrictions take  effect. Iran will restart its uranium enrichment if it cannot find a way to save the 2015 nuclear deal with the European Union after the United States pulled out last week, Tehran’s government spokesman said. The tightening market has all but eliminated a global supply overhang that depressed crude prices between late 2014 and early 2017. Surging prices were capped after China reported weaker-than-expected investment and retail sales in April and a drop in home sales, clouding its economic outlook even as policymakers try to navigate debt risks and defuse a heated trade dispute with the United States.      The data poses worries that near-record high refinery runs may be short-lived. China’s refinery runs rose nearly 12 percent in April from a year earlier, to around 12.1 million barrels per day, marking the second-highest level on record on a daily basis, data showed. Additionally, the market retreated as the U.S. dollar .DXY strengthened against other currencies to the highest since December. As the dollar strengthens, investors can retreat from dollar-denominated commodities like oil. [USD/] Despite these downward forces, the market retains support from OPEC and other producers’ production cuts and U.S. sanctions on Iran.  OPEC figures published on Monday showed oil inventories in OECD industrialized nations in March fell to 9 million barrels above the five-year average, from 340 million barrels above the average in January 2017. U.S. crude is trading at a hefty discount to Brent, the international marker, thanks to sharp rises in U.S. production to 10.7 million bpd, which has left the American domestic oil market well supplied. U.S. shale oil production is expected to rise by about 145,000 bpd to a record 7.18 million bpd in June, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Monday.

2018-05-15,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note hit its highest in about seven years on Tuesday on the heels of a report that indicated a pick-up in consumer spending, lifting the dollar to its strongest level this year and weighing on stocks. The 10-year yield neared 3.1 percent, blowing through the 3 percent level, as a wave of selling propelled the yield through a key technical support.   Wall Street’s main indexes slumped, with the Dow industrials snapping an eight-session streak of gains, hurt by concerns that rising bond yields would undercut stock valuations. The dollar’s rise also helped send gold to its low point for the year. Yields had already been increasing earlier on Tuesday before the release of data that showed a moderate rise in U.S. retail sales in April, but also that consumer spending appeared on track to accelerate after slowing sharply in the first quarter. Other data showed factory activity regaining momentum in May. A quicker pace of growth could fuel concerns about inflation that might prompt the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates at a quicker pace, investors and traders said. The data indicated consumer spending is stronger than expected by the market, said Jon Mackay, investment strategist at Schroders North America in New York. “The implication is that means inflation has more upside potential, which means the Fed is more likely than not to hike four times this year, versus what the market was pricing in a month ago, which is two to three times,” Mackay said. The 10-year yield’s rise marked its first significant move above 3 percent since breaching that level last month.  Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 20/32 in price to yield 3.0686 percent, from 2.995 percent late on Monday, after reaching 3.095 percent, its highest point since July 2011. “It’s taken some time to get through it and this is kind of that breakout day,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. The two-year yield US2YT=RR, which is most sensitive to traders’ view on Federal Reserve policy, hit its highest since August 2008. The dollar index .DXY, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, rose 0.69 percent to 93.225, after rising as high as 93.457 during the session. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 193.00 points, or 0.78 percent, to 24,706.41, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 18.68 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,711.45 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 59.69 points, or 0.81 percent, to 7,351.63. “The reason why the equity market is falling today is because we are once again pondering if the strength of the U.S. economy is enough to make the Fed raise faster in the future,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After improved trade sentiment helped stocks on Monday, equities were again jostled by developments involving U.S.-China talks. Earlier on Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad said the United States wanted a timetable on how China would open up its markets to U.S. exports, with the two countries still not close to resolving trade frictions. “A little bit of today’s jitters are related to a hangover to yesterday’s wrongly placed exuberance that a trade deal was imminent and the reality is we are in for a long slugfest between the U.S. and China,” Mackay said. Home Depot (HD.N) shares fell 1.6 percent after the home improvement chain missed Wall Street’s sales forecast. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.14 percent. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.87 percent amid weak economic data from Germany and China. Oil prices ended a shade firmer after retreating from multi-year highs hit early in the day, supported by concerns that U.S. sanctions on Iran are likely to restrict crude exports from one of the biggest producers in the Middle East. U.S. crude CLcv1 settled up 0.49 percent at $71.31 a barrel, and Brent LCOcv1 settled at $78.43, up 0.26 percent.

2018-05-15,"(Adds comments on FISC trade spat) By Julie Gordon VANCOUVER, May 15 (Reuters) - The chief executive of the LNG Canada project on British Columbia’s northern coast said on Tuesday that the company was committed to starting construction on the C$40 billion ($31.1 billion) liquefied natural gas export project this year. An investment decision on the terminal was delayed in 2016, due to sagging oil prices that hit cash flows, along with an unfavorable supply-demand outlook, but remains on track for 2018, Andy Calitz said at an LNG conference on Tuesday. “It didn’t make sense in July 2016,” he said. “When (our stakeholders) asked the inevitable question, when will you reconsider the FID? Our answer was: We will be in construction in 2018. I reaffirm that commitment today.” Calitz later told reporters that a trade spat over imported fabricated industrial steel components (FISC) was no longer an issue for the project and would not have any impact on an investment decision by the joint venture partners. LNG Canada had asked Canada’s Finance Ministry to exempt it from the 45.8 percent anti-dumping tariffs, which apply to certain FISC components imported from Spain, South Korea and China. LNG trains, most of which are built in Asia, are FISC components. Calitz did not make clear why the FISC duties were no longer an issue, but said the modules have been contracted and the company has more clarity on the parameters and legal application of the tariffs. LNG Canada is a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell Plc , PetroChina Co Ltd, Mitsubishi Corp and Korea Gas Corp. TransCanada Corp will build the pipeline. $1 = 1.2871 Canadian dollars

2018-05-15,"(Adds more details on the IPO, confirmation from Brazil’s CVM, industry context) SÃO PAULO, May 15 (Reuters) - Global commodities trader Bunge Ltd has filed for a potential public offering of its sugar and ethanol unit in Brazil, Bunge Açúcar & Bionergia SA, with the Brazilian Securities Commission, the company said on Tuesday. The U.S. headquartered company said it recently obtained debt financing for the unit, which it has prepared to operate as a stand-alone company. Bunge said it plans to keep a controlling stake in the company after the IPO, “enabling it to participate in future value creation driven by the stand-alone company’s growth and cyclical improvement in global sugar market conditions”. The global sugar market is facing challenging times due to a supply glut that has pushed raw sugar prices to the lowest levels in two and a half years. Many sugar companies in Brazil are facing low profit margins and high debt. Bunge has tried to sell its eight Brazilian sugar and ethanol plants for four years, but a separate sale process has failed to attract firm interest from strategic or financial investors. On May 8, people familiar with the matter told Reuters that the company had hired banks to prepare for a listing in Brazil. Most of Bunge’s mills in Brazil are located in the northern part of Sao Paulo state and in the south of Minas Gerais state. The company has capacity to process around 22 million tonnes of cane per year. Bunge entered the sugar and ethanol sector in Brazil in 2010, when it bought the holding Moema Participações, which controlled the then six mills. Brazil’s market regulator CVM confirmed Bunge’s listing request. The IPO prospectus is not yet available. Reporting by Diptendu Lahiri in Bengaluru, Marcelo Teixeira

2018-05-15,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased marginally in April as rising gasoline prices cut into discretionary spending, but consumer spending appeared on track to accelerate after slowing sharply in the first quarter. The economic outlook got a boost from other data on Tuesday showing factory activity regaining momentum in May on strong orders growth. While manufacturers reported paying more for raw materials, they were absorbing much of the higher costs, a sign inflation will probably continue to increase at a moderate pace. “A better pace of real consumer spending growth is taking hold in the second quarter,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. “However, rising fuel costs may be sapping gains in other spending categories.” The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.3 percent last month after surging 0.8 percent in March. April’s increase was in line with economists’ expectations. Retail sales in April advanced 4.7 percent from a year ago. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rose 0.4 percent last month after increasing 0.5 percent in March. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Economists estimated that consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was growing at a 2.5 percent annualised rate early in the second quarter. Consumer spending grew at a 1.1 percent pace in the January-March quarter, which was the slowest in nearly five years. The economy expanded at a 2.3 percent rate in the first quarter. Growth is expected to accelerate to a 3.0 percent pace in the April-June period. In a separate report, the New York Federal Reserve said its Empire State current business conditions index rebounded four points to a reading of 20.1 in May. The rise recouped the bulk of March’s decline in the index. The survey’s prices paid index raced to its highest level since 2011. But a measure of prices received by manufacturers rose marginally. Stronger consumer spending together with steadily rising inflation support economists’ expectations that the Fed will raise interest rates next month. The U.S. central bank lifted borrowing costs in March and has forecast at least two more rate hikes for this year. The U.S. dollar rallied to a five-month high against a basket of currencies after the data. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note rising to a seven-year high. Stocks on Wall Street were weaker.  Economists blamed the slowdown in consumer spending in the first quarter on delays in processing tax refunds. They also said clean-up efforts in the wake of back-to-back hurricanes in late 2017 had pulled forward spending into the fourth quarter. Consumer spending is being supported by rising wages, which are being driven by a robust labour market. While lower income taxes could also provide a boost, rising gasoline prices could  blunt some of the stimulus. Prices at the pump have increased about 31 cents to near $3.00 per gallon since January, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.   “Looking ahead, the consumer now faces the added burden of higher gasoline prices,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.  With crude oil prices rising after President Donald Trump’s decision last week to pull the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran and vow to put tough sanctions on Tehran, gasoline prices are likely to remain elevated. In April, auto sales edged up 0.1 percent after accelerating 2.1 percent in March. Receipts at service stations jumped 0.8 percent, reflecting higher gasoline prices, following a 0.3 percent gain in March. Sales at restaurants and bars fell 0.3 percent, the largest drop since February 2017. Americans also cut back on spending on hobbies. Receipts at sporting goods and hobby stores dipped 0.1 percent last month, matching March’s drop.  Consumers also scaled back spending on personal grooming, with sales at health and personal care stores falling 0.4 percent last month. But households increased spending at furniture, building material and clothing stores last month. They also boosted online purchases, but sales at electronics and appliance stores fell.

2018-05-15,"MILAN (Reuters) - European shares inched up on Tuesday after a choppy session as higher Brent crude prices lifted oil stocks to their highest level since September 2014, offsetting a drop in telecoms. The STOXX 600 index rose 0.1 percent, reversing weakness seen in morning trade after weak data from China and Germany added to a spate of less encouraging news on the global economy. Shares in oil majors BP (BP.L), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Total (TOTF.PA) and Eni (ENI.MI) rose between 0.4 and 1.3 percent as oil prices hit multi-year highs on concerns about U.S. sanctions on Iran, which are likely to restrict crude oil exports from one of the biggest producers in the Middle East. [O/R] The oil and gas index .SXEP is by far the best sectoral performer in Europe so far this year, up nearly 13 percent. Although crude oil prices retreated, the index rose 0.9 percent.  “We continue to like the sector – particularly given the strength of support for cash distributions – but the stocks’ upsides to our target prices have become much more muted after the sector’s outperformance,” said HSBC in a note. Strength in the financial sector also supported European equities with Raiffeisen (RBIV.VI) and Commerzbank (CBKG.DE)  rising 4.6 and 3.9 percent respectively following strong earning updates.    The earnings season was nearing its close with more than three-quarters of MSCI Europe companies having reported first-quarter results. “Generally it’s been slightly underwhelming on sales numbers and in line on earnings numbers,” said Rory McPherson, head of investment strategy at Psigma Investment Management.  “European banks have tended to perform quite well and have picked up a lot recently with some good earnings,” he added.     Credit Agricole (CAGR.PA) added to the optimism around banking stocks. The French bank’s shares had fallen at the open but recovered to trade up 1.2 percent after quarterly profit fell short of expectations. Telecoms were the biggest sectoral weigh to the STOXX, falling 2 percent.  Vodafone (VOD.L) fell 4.3 percent after the world’s second largest mobile operator said its boss was leaving. Vodafone, which also announced its full-year results, said CEO Vittorio Colao, who spent 10 years reshaping the group into a digital communications powerhouse, would be replaced by its current finance director. French satellite firm Eutelsat (ETL.PA) also tumbled 12 percent after warning it could fall short of its full-year revenue target. Elsewhere, Iliad (ILD.PA) shares sank 19 percent to the bottom of the STOXX after a management reshuffle and weak first-quarter results.       Dealmaking, which has been rife in European markets this year, continued with Worldline (WLN.PA) agreeing to buy the payments arm of Swiss stock exchange operator SIX for $2.75 billion. Shares in the French payments company jumped 2 percent, while Atos (ATOS.PA), which has a majority stake in Worldline, rose 1.9 percent. Temenos (TEMN.S) jumped 5.6 percent. The banking software firm was boosted by dealmaking in the sector and by its addition to MSCI’s Switzerland index, traders said.  Still in earnings news, steel-to-submarines group Thyssenkrupp (TKAG.DE) posted a surprise loss at its Industrial Solutions business, sending its shares down 6.4 percent, while Danish jewelry maker Pandora (PNDORA.CO) fell 15.5 percent on lower than expected profit due to a slowdown in China.

The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note touched its highest since July 2011, while the dollar hit its highest point of the year against a basket of currencies. Wall Street’s main stock indexes slumped, with investors concerned that rising bond yields would hurt stock valuations. U.S. retail sales rose moderately in April as rising gasoline prices cut into discretionary spending, but consumer spending appeared on track to accelerate after slowing sharply in the first quarter. The U.S. Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.3 percent last month, while data for March was revised up to show sales surging 0.8 percent instead of the previously reported 0.6 percent. The data indicated consumer spending is stronger than expected by the market, said Jon Mackay, investment strategist at Schroders North America in New York. “The implication is that means inflation has more upside potential which means the Fed is more likely than not to hike four times this year, versus what the market was pricing in a month ago which is two to three times,” Mackay said. The benchmark government yield eclipsed 3.05 percent, blowing through the key psychological level of 3 percent it hit in late April for the first time in four years. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 17/32 in price to yield 3.0576 percent, from 2.995 percent late on Monday. The dollar index, tracking it against six major currencies, rose 0.69 percent, with the euro down 0.61 percent to $1.1852. “The resurgent tone for the U.S. dollar is largely due to, number one, the move higher in Treasury bond yields across the curve and number two, the relatively solid data we saw on retail sales,” said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc in Washington D.C. After improved trade sentiment helped stocks on Monday, equities were again jostled by developments involving U.S.-China talks. Earlier on Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad said the United States wanted a timetable on how China would open up its markets to U.S. exports, with the two countries still not close to resolving trade frictions. “A little bit of today’s jitters are related to a hangover to yesterday’s wrongly placed exuberance that a trade deal was imminent and the reality is we are in for a long slugfest between the U.S. and China,” Mackay said. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 197.2 points, or 0.79 percent, to 24,702.21, the S&P 500 lost 19.78 points, or 0.72 percent, to 2,710.35 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 73.24 points, or 0.99 percent, to 7,338.08. Home Depot shares fell 1.7 percent after the home improvement chain missed Wall Street’s sales forecast. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index edged up 0.17 percent. German growth halved in the first quarter of the year due to weaker exports and less state spending as disputes with the United States over trade and Iran’s nuclear deal clouded the outlook for Europe’s biggest economy. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.90 percent. Oil prices hovered around multi-year highs, supported by concerns that U.S. sanctions on Iran are likely to restrict crude oil exports from one of the biggest producers in the Middle East. U.S. crude fell 0.07 percent to $70.91 per barrel and Brent was last at $78.94, up 0.91 percent on the day.

2018-05-15,"HANOI, May 15 (Reuters) - A unit of Russian state oil firm Rosneft, Rosneft Vietnam BV, has started drilling at a new production well in waters off the southern coast of Vietnam, the company said in a statement posted to its website on Tuesday. The drilling is significant for Vietnam, which has been struggling to maintain its crude oil and gas output amid already declining production from its key fields and ongoing pressure from China in the disputed waters of the South China Sea. The LD-3P well explored by Rosneft is part of the Lan Do gas field in Block 06.1, Rosneft said. The field has initial natural gas reserves of 23 billion cubic metres, according to the statement. Block 06.1 is 370 kms (230 miles) southeast of Vietnam’s coast and is not close to the U-shaped “nine-dash line” that marks the vast area of the South China Sea claimed by China, where the two countries have been embroiled in maritime disputes. In March, Vietnam halted an oil drilling project in the nearby “Red Emperor” block following pressure from China, sources told Reuters. The block is licensed to Spanish energy firm Repsol , which has asked Vietnam to pay compensation over the issue. In April, Vietnam’s state oil firm PetroVietnam admitted that maritime tensions with China will hurt its offshore exploration and production activities this year. The Lan Do gas field drilling will be undertaken using the Hakuryu-5 equipment made by Japanese company Japan Drilling Co., Ltd, Rosneft said in the statement. With sanctions barring Russia’s largest oil producer from offshore extraction with Western companies, Rosneft is looking to its operations in Vietnam for the experience needed to expand its global reach. Rosneft said that production offshore Vietnam is very profitable. Operational costs to produce gas stand at $1.5 per barrel of oil equivalent, half of what it usually costs the company.

2018-05-15,"NEW YORK, May 15 (Reuters) - Republican Senator Chuck Grassley on Tuesday said Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt must scale back the use of biofuels waivers for small refineries, or else he will join other lawmakers calling for Pruitt’s resignation. The demand ramps up pressure on the embattled EPA administrator, who is already under pressure from mostly Democratic lawmakers to step down over controversies that include high spending on travel and security. Corn state senators like Iowa’s Grassley have been infuriated by the EPA’s decision to provide an unusually large number of waivers to refineries in recent months, exempting them from a law that requires biofuels like ethanol be mixed into the nation’s fuel. The EPA has authority to exempt small refineries from the Renewable Fuel Standard if they can prove complying would cause them economic hardship - but biofuels advocates say overusing the waivers kills demand for ethanol. “I am sick and tired of messing around with this anymore,” Grassley said in a call with reporters, refering to the EPA’s handling of biofuels regulation. Asked if he thought EPA would scale back the use of the small refinery waivers, Grassley said: “They better, or else I am going to be calling for Pruitt’s resignation.” The EPA has said its criteria for approving hardship waivers for small refineries has not changed from past years. Several Democratic lawmakers have called on Pruitt to step down in recent weeks, but President Donald Trump has thrown his support behind the agency chief, saying he is doing a “fantastic” job rolling back hurdles to industry. Trump has been seeking to mediate discussions with lawmakers over the future of the Renewable Fuel Standard in recent months with an eye toward reducing the regulatory cost for refiners without undermining ethanol demand. Trump told lawmakers in a closed-door meeting last week that he had decided to do so by expanding sales of high-ethanol gasoline called E15, counting ethanol exports toward annual volumes quotas, and cutting back the use of waivers, according to a source briefed on the meeting. The corn lobby supports expanding sales of E15 and reducing the waiver program, but opposes counting exports toward volume quotas. The oil industry, meanwhile, is resisting the expansion of E15 - because it worries the move will cut petroleum’s share of the fuel market - and supports both the waivers and the export tweak as ways of cutting regulatory costs.

2018-05-15,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway postponed a final decision on whether to go ahead with a project to develop Europe’s first industrial carbon capture and offshore storage (CCS) project, after dropping one of its participants, Yara International. The government said on Tuesday that fertilizer maker Yara’s site, one of three industrial facilities identified for the project, was not suitable and the project as a whole needed to be more cost effective. Governments and businesses seeking to cut carbon emissions have long cherished the idea of storing CO2 in the ground rather than emitting it. The Norwegian government, which has estimated its project will cost up to 12.6 billion Norwegian crowns ($1.6 billion), had planned to decide in 2019 on whether to invest some of the money for the project, but on Tuesday put that decision off until some time during 2020 or 2021.  The other two industrial sites identified for the project are Oslo’s Klemetsrud waste-to-energy plant owned by Finland’s Fortum, and a site owned by Norcem, a subsidiary of HeidelbergCement. The government also said on Tuesday that it needed more time to decide whether to grant support to Fortum’s project. However, it gave Norcem’s site the green light, saying it would grant 80 million crowns ($10 million) for Norcem’s project to capture about 400,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year. The government said Yara’s facility was unsuitable due to uncertainty about the plant’s future emissions as it planned to replace liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) with less-emitting liquefied natural gas (LNG) as its raw material. “We agree with the government’s conclusion and will discontinue the project,” a spokeswoman for Yara said.  The International Energy Agency (IEA) considers CCS technology to be essential to limit CO2 emissions as part of an international agreement to curb global warming reached in Paris in 2015. Investments in the project at Norcem’s cement plant were estimated at 3.1 billion crowns, and at Fortum’s plant at 4.5 billion crowns, the government said in its revised 2018 fiscal budget plan on Tuesday. It said that while estimates by external consultants Atkins and Oslo Economics showed the overall project costs to be too high to make it profitable for society, the government would continue looking for a cost-effective solution. “After the concept studies, the timeline for the project suggests that a potential investment decision may be taken in 2020/2021,” the government said. Norway’s oil and gas industry lobby welcomed the decision to grant support to Norcem, but said more capture sites were needed to make the project viable. Both the lobby group and a top trade union said they were concerned by the delay in the government’s decision. Norway aims to take a lead in developing CCS technology. As well as the government-backed project, oil and gas firms Statoil, Total and Shell are separately studying the possibility of storing captured CO2 under the seabed on the Norwegian continental shelf.

2018-05-15,"SARAJEVO, May 15 (Reuters) - The Montenegrin government on Tuesday paid a first tranche of 68.9 million euros ($81.6 million) to buy Italian company A2A’s stake in the Balkan country’s power utility EPCG. EPCG has been jointly managed by A2A and the Montenegrin government, but the two have been at odds for years because A2A opposed the government’s plans to add a new coal-fired power plant, while Montenegro complained of low investment by A2A. A2A said last June it planned to sell its entire 41.7 percent holding in EPCG for 250 million euros. However, the Montenegrin government said on Tuesday the total amount it would pay had been trimmed “from 250 million euros to 230.6 million euros, at a discount rate that corresponds to Montenegro’s borrowing parameters and the corresponding maturity”. Following the initial payment, the government will hold a 70.16 percent stake in EPCG, up from 57.01 percent previously. It was initially envisaged the government would pay for A2A’s stake in seven annual instalments, to ease the burden on the state budget. However, the government said it would pay the remaining amount in three tranches due in July 2018, May 2019 and July 2019. A2A, controlled by the Italian cities of Milan and Brescia, spent around 436 million euros on buying a 43.7 percent holding in EPCG, which it later cut to 41.7 percent. $1 = 0.8441 euros

2018-05-15," LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. net petroleum imports have fallen to the lowest level in more than half a century as a result of the shale revolution, which is profoundly changing the impact higher oil prices have on the economy. Since the 1860s, the United States has been the world’s largest producer and consumer of oil, which means it has a complicated relationship with oil prices. Rising oil prices benefit some businesses and workers at the expense of others, and the same has been true about a sharp price fall. Until after World War Two, the country was a net exporter to the rest of the world, the first era of U.S. energy dominance. But from the late 1940s and especially the 1950s, the United States turned into an increasingly major oil importer. Since then, the principal effect of a rise in oil prices has been to transfer income from consumers and businesses in the United States to oil-producing countries in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. Rising prices have put pressure on the U.S. balance of payments and the dollar’s value, contributing to an occasionally negative relationship between the price of oil and the exchange rate. But as net imports have declined in the last decade, the picture has changed again, and the main transfers of income are now occurring within the United States rather than with the rest of the world. The impact of oil prices on the U.S. trade deficit and the exchange rate is becoming much less significant than before. Instead, rising prices are transferring income from net consuming states such as California, Florida, New York and Illinois to net producing states including Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and North Dakota. Rising prices are also transferring income from households, motorists, the transportation sector, manufacturers and retailers to the oil industry and its supply chain. In the broadest sense, rising oil prices tend to depress spending by consumers while enhancing investment by the oil industry (“How rising oil prices will affect the United States”, Barron’s, May 11). In the short term, rising oil prices have provided a significant boost to the economic expansion as the positive impact on investment has outweighed the negative impact on consumer spending. But that positive scenario may not last if oil prices continue to rise over the next two years. Domestic crude production has more than doubled from an average of 5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2008 to 10.3 million bpd in February 2018. Government policies have also cut import dependence by requiring increases in vehicle fuel economy and mandating the addition of ethanol and biodiesel to the fuel supply. Domestic consumption of petroleum products peaked at 20.8 million bpd in 2005 and was averaging 19.9 million bpd in 2017. The result has been a transformation in U.S. petroleum trade, with the country becoming an increasingly important exporter of refined products, such as diesel, and more recently crude oil. The size and suddenness of this shift is one reason why the rise of shale production in the United States qualifies as a genuine energy revolution. Net imports of crude oil and petroleum products peaked at more than 12.5 million bpd in 2005, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. By 2017, net imports had fallen to 3.7 million bpd and they continued to shrink in the first three months of 2018. (Chart: tmsnrt.rs/2rG6GIs) The United States remains an important net importer of crude (roughly 6 million bpd in recent months) but has become an important net exporter of refined products (3 million bpd). The balance of payments is now much more insulated from the impact of changing oil prices than during the 2008 oil shock. Between January and March 2018, the U.S. trade deficit with the rest of the world worsened by almost $23 billion compared with a year earlier. The non-petroleum components of the deficit worsened by $26 billion but the petroleum deficit actually improved by almost $4 billion (“International Trade in Goods and Services”, Census Bureau, May 2018). The rise in U.S. oil production has encouraged some policymakers to speak about achieving energy independence or even a second era of energy dominance. The reality is more complicated. Increased domestic energy production is clearly beneficial for the economy. But sharp increases or reductions in oil prices can still have profound distributional effects within the United States. Since capital and labour do not move without friction between industries and states, sudden income redistribution can still have an adverse impact on the overall performance of the economy. The oil slump between 2014 and 2016 deepened the overall slowdown in business investment and contributed to a soft patch in overall economic growth, which initially overshadowed the gains for consumers. The rise in prices since 2016 is now contributing to an acceleration of business investment and activity in the oil and gas sector and all along the supply chain, helping boost the overall economic expansion. Mining, which includes oil and gas production, was the fastest-growing sector of the U.S. economy in 2017 (“Gross domestic product by industry: fourth quarter and annual 2017”, Bureau of Economic Analysis, April 2018). Rising oil prices are one reason the economies of some major oil-producing states outperformed the rest of the country towards the end of 2017. Texas was the fastest-growing state economy in the country in the final three months of 2017 (“Gross domestic product by state: fourth quarter and annual 2017”, Bureau of Economic Analysis, May 2018). But beyond a certain point, rising oil prices will start to weigh on investment and spending by the non-oil sector and households, retarding overall growth. Moreover, the United States remains embedded in a dense web of international trading relationships with petroleum producing and consuming countries. Higher oil prices tend to improve the opportunities for U.S. exports and outward investment in petroleum-exporting countries in the Middle East and other regions. But they also tend to curb export growth to petroleum-importing countries, notably China, India, Japan and in Europe, which include some of the country’s most important trading partners.  John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

Thousands of Gaza residents turned out on Tuesday for the funerals of Palestinians killed by Israeli troops a day earlier, in the bloodiest day for Palestinians since the 2014 Gaza conflict. “The situation in the Middle East is explosive, violence is doing the talking, war could loom,” Le Drian told lawmakers in parliament. “We are committed to the security of Israel but Israel’s security cannot justify this level of violence,” he said. Monday’s violence on the border took place as the United States opened its new embassy in Jerusalem. “We have disagreements with the United States,” Le Drian said, referring both to the U.S policy on Iran and to the embassy move. “We (also) have a disagreement about the method. Because in both cases the United States decided to act unilaterally,” he said.

MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.3 percent. Futures pointed to a lower open for U.S. equities, with S&P 500 e-minis down 0.2 percent. European stocks snapped early losses, with the benchmark Stoxx 600 rising 0.2 percent and helped by oil stocks , that rose by nearly a percent. The UK’s FTSE 100 and Italy’s FTSE MIB, both of which have high weightings to energy stocks, rose by 0.4 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.2 percent, after China reported weaker-than-expected investment and retail sales in April and a drop in home sales, clouding its economic outlook even as policymakers try to navigate debt risks and defuse a heated trade row with the United States. Mixed messages in U.S.-China trade talks also weighed on sentiment for global investors. The two countries are still “very far apart” on resolving trade frictions, U.S. ambassador to China Terry Branstad said on Tuesday as a second round of high-level talks was set to begin in Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump drew ire from lawmakers after suggesting he would help Chinese firm ZTE Corp, that flouted U.S. sanctions on trade with Iran and North Korea, with intelligence officials also saying the decision threatens national security. “Sino-U.S. trade negotiations have provided mixed signals, the White House promising conciliation (over ZTE) then indicating that some form of punishment is still in the cards,” said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets. Oil prices hit a 3-1/2-year high on Tuesday, supported by tight supply and planned U.S. sanctions against Iran that are likely to restrict crude oil exports from one of the biggest producers in the Middle East. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, rose to as much as $79.22 per barrel, its highest level since November 2014. “Oil prices are touching fresh multi-year highs as robust demand prospects coupled with a tense geopolitical backdrop make for a potent bullish cocktail,” said Stephen Brennock, analyst at London brokers PVM Oil Associates. In fixed income, the U.S. 10-year bond yield rose above the key level of 3 percent, sending borrowing costs higher in a number of other countries and supporting the dollar. The 10-year yield was last trading at 3.0318 percent, just off levels not seen since January 2014. In Europe, the benchmark German bond yield rose to 0.636 percent, its highest level in three weeks, with investors also taking note of hawkish commentary from Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau, who said the European Central Bank could soon give guidance on its first rate hike. “We have this Galhau interview and he was very much pointing to rate hikes after the end of QE (quantitative easing),” said DZ Bank rates strategist Daniel Lenz, explaining the weakness in euro zone debt markets. “And we still have a high oil price and U.S. Treasury yields above 3 percent.” Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar index gained 0.46 percent.

2018-05-15,"HOUSTON, May 15 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s state-run oil firm PDVSA has bought nearly $440 million worth of foreign crude and shipped it directly to Cuba on friendly credit terms - and often at a loss, according to internal company documents reviewed by Reuters. The shipments are the first documented instances of the OPEC nation buying crude to supply regional allies instead of selling them oil from its own vast reserves. Venezuela made the discounted deliveries, which have not been previously reported, despite its dire need for foreign currency to bolster its collapsing economy and to import food and medicine amid widespread shortages. The open-market oil purchases to subsidize one of Venezuela’s few remaining allies underscores its increasing global isolation and the disintegration of its energy sector under socialist President Nicolas Maduro. The purchases came as Venezuela’s crude production hit a 33-year low in the first quarter - down 28 percent in 12 months. Its refineries are operating at a third of capacity, and its workers are resigning by the thousands. (For a graphic on Venezuela's rising oil imports and falling exports, see: tmsnrt.rs/2wHCTUF ) PDVSA bought the crude for up to $12 per barrel more than it priced the same oil when it shipped to Cuba, according to prices on internal documents reviewed by Reuters. But Cuba may never pay cash for the cargoes because Venezuela has long accepted goods and services from Cuba in return for oil under a pact signed in 2000 by late presidents Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro. PDVSA, the Venezuela government and the Cuba government did not respond to requests for comment. Venezuela’s government has previously said it only imports oil to blend with its own tar-like crude to improve quality and create an exportable product, or to feed its refinery in Curacao. But hundreds of PDSVA documents examined by Reuters detailing imports and exports, dated from January 2017 to May of this year, show the company is now buying crude at market prices to deliver to allies - in shipments that never pass through Venezuela. The subsidized deliveries are aimed at maintaining political support from Cuba, one of a dwindling group of Venezuela allies, according to diplomats, politicians and PDVSA executives. “Maduro is giving away everything he can because these countries’ backing, especially from Cuba, is all the political support he has left,” said a former top Venezuelan government official who declined to be identified. Caracas has come under increasing international pressure as the United States, the European Union and Canada have sanctioned Venezuela for what they see as Maduro’s attempts to cement a dictatorship. As Venezuela spends on oil imports, it has imported less of everything else its citizens desperately need. Venezuela’s spending on non-oil imports plunged from nearly $46 billion in 2011 to $6 billion in 2017, according Venezuela Central Bank data and Ecoanalitica, a Caracas-based economic research organization. The oil PDVSA procured for Cuba was Russian Urals crude, the documents show, a variety well-suited for Cuban refineries constructed from Soviet-era equipment. PDVSA bought the crude from Chinese, Russian and Swiss firms – not for cash, but a pledge that PDVSA would deliver other oil shipments later, the documents show. That adds to Venezuela’s already towering debts of oil to state-owned firms in Russia and China, which together have extended Venezuela’s government more than $60 billion in oil-for-loan deals that have propped up its budget amid declining exports and lower oil prices. “It’s nonsense to import oil to keep subsidized exports flowing,” said Ecoanalitica President Asdrubal Oliveros. PETRO-DIPLOMACY Venezuela’s socialist government has long used oil for domestic and international political ends, subsidizing goods and services at home and currying favor across the region with oil deliveries on generous terms. Venezuela’s oil supply arrangements have helped soften international political censure of Maduro’s government. The Organization of American States (OAS), which includes most Western Hemisphere nations, last year took up a motion seeking to pressure Venezuela to hold free elections, liberate political prisoners and declare a humanitarian crisis. The effort was defeated when 12 countries that have received regular oil shipments from Venezuela in recent years - about a third of the OAS membership - opposed it or refused to vote. Eventually, the OAS passed a watered-down motion urging free and fair elections. Venezuela has avoided formal OAS condemnation “thanks to the support of the bloc of Caribbean nations that have benefited from its subsidized oil and development programs for years,” said Michael Fitzpatrick, deputy assistant secretary in the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said on April 30 during a talk at the Atlantic Council, a foreign policy think tank in Washington. Most of those countries are members of Venezuela’s Petrocaribe trade pact, launched in 2005, which has granted up to 16 Caribbean and Central American states with oil supplies on favorable terms. OAS President Luis Almagro declined to comment through press office representative Monica Reyes. El Salvador’s Economy Minister, Luz Estrella Rodriguez, said Petrocaribe and other pacts promoted by Venezuela had played an important role in her country’s development. “Our country is very grateful,” she said. “The government of El Salvador, of course, is a friend and an ally of the Venezuelan government.” El Salvador refused to vote last year on the OAS motion to condemn Venezuela. Venezuela also supplied fuel last year to Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Dominica, the documents show. In total, members of oil trade pacts with Venezuela last year received at least 103,000 bpd of crude and refined products from PDVSA, the documents show, or about 6 percent of Venezuela’s exports. The falling output of Venezuela’s refineries has also left the country increasingly dependent on fuel imports to meet domestic consumption. The internal PDVSA data reviewed by Reuters shows Venezuela last year purchased some 180,000 barrels per day of foreign crude and refined products from PetroChina, Rosneft , Lukoil, Reliance Industries and other suppliers, 17 percent more than in 2016. Those companies did not respond to requests for comment. The purchases totaled more $4 billion, according to PDVSA records. Last year, total oil-industry purchases, including equipment and services, consumed 45 percent of Venezuela’s total import spending, up from 13 percent in 2011, Ecoanalitica data shows. Energy imports totaled $5.4 billion out of $11.9 billion. The resulting scarcity of food, medicine and employment has caused thousands of citizens to flee Venezuela. The pay of PDVSA workers now can’t cover the barest essentials because of the collapse of its currency, the bolivar. “A worker’s salary is not even enough for a box of eggs,” said Hector Bertis, a PDVSA worker and union leader. “We go to the bank, and they give us 10,000 bolivars - less than what a transportation fare costs.” (Reporting by Marianna Parraga in Houston and Jeanne Liendo in Calgary; additional reporting by Alexandra Ulmer in Washington, Paula Rosales in San Salvador and Gary McWilliams in Houston; Editing by Gary McWilliams, Simon Webb and Brian Thevenot)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-oil-imports/exclusive-as-venezuelans-suffer-maduro-buys-foreign-oil-to-subsidize-cuba-idUKL1N1P5296,15 May 2018,"Venezuela's state-run oil firm

2018-05-15,"PARIS, May 15 (Reuters) - Euro-denominated financing set up by European countries to trade with Iran will not be enough to sustain economic ties with Tehran in the face of U.S. sanctions, an adviser to the French president said on Tuesday. Following Washington’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement last week, Europe needs a “more global approach to reinforce our legal arsenal” and defend companies doing business with countries under unilateral U.S. sanctions, the Elysee official said during a briefing for reporters in Paris. Business leaders met French officials on Tuesday as President Emmanuel Macron’s government presses Washington for waivers covering companies such as Airbus, Sanofi , Renault and PSA Group. Many have reinvested in Iran since the 2015 accord, which suspended sanctions in return for curbs on Tehran’s nuclear programmes. France, Italy and Germany are among countries that had set up export mechanisms designed to avoid dollar transactions and thereby withstand an anticipated renewal of U.S. sanctions. But France’s scheme, administered by the bpifrance sovereign fund, was recently put on hold, sources have said. “It’s important that we develop mechanisms allowing us to counter extraterritorial laws, and a financing vehicle such as the BPI’s is part of that,” the senior adviser said. “But Iran is a particularly tough case, and I’m not sure the BPI (programme) alone will allow big companies to go and invest in Iran.” A second French official said it was not clear how much appetite there would be for euro-denominated financing tools from companies in Iran. “We don’t have much with which to threaten the Americans. When you’re an economic player and a multinational with interests in the United States that works in dollars you have a choice and that choice is made quickly.” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, after meeting executives, reiterated that France wants the European Union’s executive to strengthen sanction-blocking rules and create a body that enforces the bloc’s own economic and trade rules, similar to the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. In Brussels Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini vowed to maintain the 2015 accord after talks in Brussels - but diplomats conceded that U.S. sanctions threatened its substance. In the short term, France is focused on “ensuring an orderly exit from the Iranian market” for companies now seeking to withdraw, the Elysee official said, while “creating the conditions for those who want to stay to do so”. Europeans will discuss the issue at an informal EU summit in Sofia on Wednesday and Thursday.

2018-05-15,"COLOMBO, May 15 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan shares ended firmer on Tuesday, edging up from a near five-week closing low hit in the previous session, led by Ceylon Cold Stores Plc, while the recent fuel price hike weighed on sentiment, stockbrokers said. The day’s turnover slumped to near one-month low as investors stayed on the sidelines, they said. State-run fuel retailer Ceylon Petroleum Corp (CPC) raised retail prices for gasoline and diesel on Thursday midnight in response to the hike in oil prices, while Lanka IOC, a subsidiary of Indian Oil Corp, increased fuel rates the same day. “It was a slow day and market participation was very low as the investors are still awaiting to see the real economic impact of the fuel price hike,” said Hisham Haniffa, assistant manager, Softlogic Stockbrokers (pvt) Ltd. The Colombo stock index ended 0.18 percent firmer at 6,456.32, snapping six straight sessions of declines. “Market is hovering near its psychological barrier of 6,450 level.” The day’s turnover stood at 325.4 million rupees ($2.06 million), its lowest since April 19, and well below this year’s daily average of 1.02 billion rupees. Foreign investors net bought 6.3 million rupees worth of equities on Tuesday, but they have been net sellers of 662.3 million rupees worth of equities so far this year. Shares in Ceylon Cold Stores Plc ended 1.5 percent higher, while Lanka ORIX Leasing Co Plc closed 2.5 percent firmer and Commercial Bank of Ceylon Plc ended 0.3 percent up. The market shrugged off the central bank’s policy decision on Friday as it was widely expected, brokers said. The central bank kept its key policy rates steady, a little more than a month after it unexpectedly cut the main lending rate, forecasting a modest recovery in the economy this year after growth slumped to a 16-year low in 2017. Analysts said the depreciation of rupee also weighed on investor sentiment as it is likely to hit profits of some listed firms that rely heavily on imports. The rupee hit a fresh low of 158.00 per U.S. dollar on Monday on importer demand for the U.S. currency. Analysts said concerns over political instability following President Maithripala Sirisena’s decision to suspend the parliament last month after 16 legislators from his ruling coalition defected also weighed on sentiment. Last week, Sirisena urged his own coalition government and the opposition to end a power struggle in order to achieve ambitious goals including anti-corruption measures. $1 = 158.1500 Sri Lankan rupees

2018-05-15,"(Repeats with no changes. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell ADELAIDE, May 15 (Reuters) - How can Australia’s oil and gas industry, on the cusp of becoming the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), have failed so comprehensively in the public relations battle against environmental activists? This was the question posed by Kevin Gallagher, chief executive of Santos Ltd, the country’s No. 2 oil and gas producer, to the annual conference of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association. It’s taken several years, but the country’s LNG producers have finally realised there is mounting public anger against their industry, and they are very much on the back foot when it comes to telling what they believe is a positive story. The public relations problems for the industry have been brewing for several years, but have been greatly exacerbated in the past year by a combination of factors. These include sharply higher natural gas prices for domestic consumers and a well-orchestrated campaign by green activists against the industry. This environmental campaign attacks the industry on several levels, from claiming that onshore natural gas production is unsafe and will damage farmland, to articulating that the rise of Australia’s LNG export industry has raised prices and starved domestic consumers of supply, to drawing a direct link between natural gas production and climate change. Not all of these arguments stand up to scrutiny, but the industry has been slow to realise that relying on reasoned and science-based arguments when its opponents are using populism and fear and outrage is a losing position. What the industry has taken too long to realise is that in the court of public opinion it doesn’t matter that 13 different government inquiries have found that extracting natural gas is safe as long as it is properly regulated, if the populace believes the scare-mongering of activists and farmers. A refusal to engage has cost the industry credibility, and rebuilding a public image of LNG producers as a valuable contributor to society will take time, despite the $200 billion the industry has invested over the past decade to build eight new LNG projects. Zoe Yujnovich, chairwoman of Royal Dutch Shell’s operations in Australia and also of APPEA, told the conference the industry was well received and respected in the largely remote communities where its operations are located, but vilified and distrusted in Australia’s large cities. “So, a question we must answer is: Why is there such a gulf in perception from the regional areas where we operate to the commentators and activists of the inner city who rely on our products?” she said. Yujnovich said the industry has been unwilling to engage in conversations with other Australians, and when it has, it has chosen to avoid challenging or confrontational dialogue. In effect, the industry has sat in its ivory tower, believing that science backs its positions and that its products provide the energy the community needs. It’s this sort of disengagement that has allowed the industry to be tarred with the narrative that it doesn’t contribute its fair share of taxes, that it is sending Australians’ natural resources offshore for its own profit, and that it is responsible for surging domestic prices for natural gas and electricity. There is an element of truth to the pricing argument against the industry, insofar as the establishment of three LNG export plants on the east coast in Queensland state has effectively linked the domestic natural gas price to Asian LNG prices. Instead of recognising the issue, the industry pushed back against government plans to ensure that domestic gas supply needs were met before the demands of the LNG plants. The industry has also been largely ineffectual in lobbying the various state and territory governments to open up more onshore exploration areas and end bans that have been imposed. The Australian states of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania all have some form of ban or restriction on natural gas exploration and production, and the Northern Territory just lifted a ban on hydraulic fracturing after a government inquiry found the risks could be managed. There are several steps the Australian natural gas industry can take to improve its public image and rebuild trust. The first is to cooperate with each other to ensure the domestic market is well supplied at prices that will allow industrial companies to continue to be competitive, thus preventing them from shifting operations offshore. The second is to ensure that governments realise that increasing supply is a key way of delivering cheaper prices. And the third is to do more than just engage communities where they operate, but also to talk to people in the cities as to what the industry actually delivers, and what it can’t.

2018-05-15,"FRANKFURT, May 15 (Reuters) - A consortium of western companies and Russia’s Gazprom that is due to build the controversial subsea Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany said on Tuesday it was starting preparatory work in the Greifswald bay off Germany’s Baltic coast. “Five dredgers are now working on the trench for the two pipeline strings,” the consortium, based in Switzerland’s Zug, said in a press release. Nord Stream 2 will consist of two pipelines running in parallel. “Preparatory works are in accordance with the Stralsund mining authority’s planning approval,” it said. The regulatory authority granted the consortium a permit in January to build the pipeline in German territorial waters. There have been years of political wrangling over whether the additional route to bring Siberian gas to Germany directly from next year is in Europe’s interest, economically and geopolitically. Environmentalists in Germany and Finland are still trying to halt licensing, saying authorities should take more care the pipeline does not endanger marine life. The consortium has said it will mitigate environmental problems, while arguing for the economic case of the project, as Europe will need more imported gas in future. Nord Stream 1, of an identical 55 bcm to the planned new pipeline and opened in 2010, has proved successful, it says. The Nord Stream 2 project has said it will tap banks for financing in the fourth quarter of 2018 or early next year. Denmark still has to rule whether the pipeline can be built near its coast, for which there is no concrete timing. Other routine permissioning processes are still under way in Sweden and Russia. Gazprom’s Western partners are energy companies Uniper , Wintershall, Engie, Austria’s OMV and Anglo-Dutch group Shell. Poland’s anti-monopoly office said last week it had launched proceedings against Gazprom and the five European firms financing Nord Stream 2 over a potential breach of anti-monopoly laws. Poland sees the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would double Russia’s gas export capacity via the Baltic Sea, as a threat to Europe’s energy security and argues it will strengthen Gazprom’s already dominant position in the market.

2018-05-15,"OSLO (Reuters) - British utility National Grid (NG.L) has developed a tool that can forecast the carbon intensity of electricity generation by region for up to 48 hours ahead of the power production, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. In the previous version of its tool, National grid was able to calculate only the overall carbon emissions in Britain. The new tool, developed in a partnership with Environmental Defense Fund Europe and WWF, will help consumers understand when and where the power is “greener” in order pick the right moment of the day to consume cleaner energy, said the firm. “This tailored information can tell people in advance when’s best to turn on the washing machine, load the dishwasher or charge the car, helping everyone to use power when it’s cleanest and most likely more cost efficient,” said Duncan Burt, director of the system operator at National Grid. On Tuesday, the new forecasting tool predicted that over the next 24 hours North East England and South Scotland will be providing the greenest electricity. Britain recently clocked up over 72 consecutive hours without the need for coal-fired power, National Grid said, adding that solar energy provided more power than gas did in a day for the first time.

2018-05-15,"* Focus on industrial users may help avoid big price swings * Rival CME already has several premium contracts * London-based LME aims to launch aluminium premium contract BEIJING, May 15 (Reuters) - Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) said on Tuesday it would launch China’s first real-time platform for trading physical commodities from copper to chemicals, as it seeks to improve transparency and challenge rivals in the global futures market. The platform will set physical premiums and discounts for cash-settled futures warrants depending on the commodity’s location, quality and brand. In commodities trading, buyers typically pay a premium on top of or receive a discount from the underlying futures price for the physical delivery of the product. “The trade aims to promote a premium and discount pricing mechanism among different brands, grades and delivery regions of the commodities, and improve efficiency of commodities trading,” ShFE said in a statement. It did not give a date for the launch. All ShFE’s futures products - from ferrous and base metals to precious metals, energy and chemicals - would be available on the platform but only companies would be allowed to participate not individuals, it said. That suggests the bourse wants to limit the platform to industrial users, such as copper fabricators, aluminium smelters or chemical makers, helping avoid big physical price swings. Small commodities trading platform investors tend to trade on a short-term basis, often causing price volatility. ShFE’s planned platform aimed to make trading more transparent and reduce risks, the bourse said. Margins would not be applied, with full payment required upfront, it said. The move mirrors that of its U.S. rival CME Group Inc , which has launched cash-settled U.S. premium contracts for aluminium and copper in recent years. The London Metal Exchange, the world’s oldest and largest metals marketplace, has said it also plans to introduce cash-settled regional aluminium premiums in the future. The initiative also comes as China’s commodities derivatives exchanges have started opening up to foreign investors for the first time, part of an long-term effort to increase their influence over global prices of everything from oil to copper. In March, Shanghai launched a crude oil contract, the first commodity derivatives futures market to be open to international investors. This month, Dalian Commodity Exchange took a similar step, giving foreign players access to its iron ore futures. In the past decade, the Shanghai exchange has captured a greater share of global metals futures trading volumes from the LME as the country has grown into the world’s top consumer and producer of metals. Turnover has also boomed as China’s burgeoning middle class has developed an appetite for investing in financial markets.

2018-05-15,"(Repeats with no changes) By Devika  Krishna Kumar, Libby George and Florence Tan NEW YORK/LONDON/SINGAPORE, May 15 (Reuters) - Oil futures prices have soared past three-year highs, OPEC’s deal has cut millions of barrels of inventory worldwide and investors are betting in record numbers that prices could rocket past $80 and even hit $90 a barrel this year. But physical markets for oil shipments tell a different story. Spot crude prices are at their steepest discounts to futures prices in years due to weak demand from refiners in China and a backlog of cargoes in Europe. Sellers are struggling to find buyers for West African, Russian and Kazakh cargoes, while pipeline bottlenecks trap supply in west Texas and Canada. The divergence is notable because traditionally, physical markets are viewed as a better gauge of short-term fundamentals. Crude traders who peddle cargoes to refineries worldwide say speculators are on shaky ground as they drive futures markets above $70 a barrel, their highest levels for three-and-a-half years, on concerns about tighter supply from Venezuela and the potential impact of U.S. sanctions on supply from Iran. Investors have piled millions of dollars in record wagers in the options market, betting on a further rally on the back of rising geopolitical tensions, particularly in Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, and the global decline in supply. “Guys who are trading futures have a view that draws are coming and big draws are coming,” a U.S.-based crude trader at a global commodity merchant said, adding that demand could ramp up as global refinery maintenance ends. “Over the next few weeks, we should start to see markets globally clean up, but if that doesn’t happen, I think we could be in trouble.” Brent, the benchmark on which two-thirds of the world’s oil is priced, has surpassed $78 a barrel, the highest since November 2014. U.S. crude futures hit a high just short of $72. Inventories in the developed world are now just 9 million barrels above the five-year average, down from 340 million barrels above the average in January 2017, after supply cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia. In the last few weeks, expectations that U.S. President Donald Trump would withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement added to bullishness. Following Trump’s announcement making good on that threat last week, prices surged further. Analysts estimate anywhere from 200,000 to 1 million bpd could be cut from global exports next year. “Any reduction in Iranian supply will likely exacerbate market deficits, suggesting upward pressure on pricing,” wrote Greg Sharenow, PIMCO commodities portfolio manager, which sees oil surpassing $80 in the short term. In the weeks before Trump’s decision, hedge funds and others piled a record number of bets into bullish crude oil options. Traders currently hold a record 21.3 million barrels worth of options that pay off if the December Brent contract hits $90 by late October. Bets that U.S. crude will hit $85 a barrel by mid-June are currently at a record above 14,000 contracts. These bets are being made due to strong demand, not just fear of political destabilization, said Scott Shelton, energy futures broker with ICAP in Durham, North Carolina. “The bigger picture of demand keeping up with supply...is much more important,” Shelton said. Those on the front lines of the physical market are not convinced. Traders say the surge in U.S. exports to more than 2 million bpd has saturated some markets, leaving benchmark prices ripe for a correction. “There is a huge disconnect between futures and fundamentals,” a trader with a Chinese independent refiner said. “I won’t be surprised if prices correct by $20 a barrel.” Increased U.S. competition has dented sales of oil from Nigeria and Azerbaijan, which produce similar quality oil and compete for buyers in Europe and Latin America. Physical prices have sunk even as benchmarks on which they are based stay buoyant. The strength of Brent crude, now trading at nearly $7 above U.S. futures WTCLc1-LCOc1, and $4 above Dubai, DUB-EFS-1M has made it hard to find buyers for grades priced off Brent. Russian Urals hit a seven-year discount against dated Brent BFO-URL-NWE while Kazakh CPC Blend BFO-CPC crashed to its weakest since mid-2012 this month. Separately, shipments of West African crude to Asia hit a five-month low in April due to a backlog at Chinese ports. Clogged pipelines have hit key U.S. oil grades, including in west Texas WTC-WTM WTC-WTS, where the discount to U.S. crude is near its widest in three years. Some are confident the world’s refineries will gobble up these barrels when they finish seasonal maintenance. About 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is expected to be offline through June. “For the last three, four, five months we’ve seen high turnarounds globally,” a U.S. crude trader said, referencing maintenance works. “Once you get past that, all of a sudden (you’re) looking at 3 million barrels per day of fresh crude consumption.” But whether that is enough to support Brent at $80 and above is yet to be seen. “I think it’s touch and go,” he added.

2018-05-15,"VUNG TAU, Vietnam (Reuters) - With sanctions barring Russia’s largest oil producer from offshore extraction with Western companies, Rosneft is looking to its operations in Vietnam for the experience needed to expand its global reach. The Southeast Asian country is a traditional ally of Russia, and Kremlin-controlled Rosneft is part of a consortium with Petrovietnam and India’s ONGC which last year produced almost 3 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas. The consortium provides almost a tenth of Vietnam’s electricity needs and last year also produced 65,000 tonnes of gas condensate, mainly for the domestic market but some of which was exported to Singapore.  “The project in Vietnam allows us to develop operator skills working on the shelf, and is also a platform for the possible growth of business in other countries of Southeast Asia,” said Christopher Einchcomb, director of Rosneft’s upstream foreign projects support department. “I am sure that the experience gained in Vietnam will be used not only for the company’s work offshore Vietnam but acquired competencies will be applied in the planning and implementation of ‘exploration and production’ projects in other remote regions of the world,” he said. U.S. sanctions imposed on Moscow after its annexation of Crimea in 2014 have prohibited Western companies from working in Russian Arctic oilfields, producing tight oil or deepwater exploration in the country.  U.S. major ExxonMobil decided to withdraw from sanctions-hit joint projects with Rosneft this year. Mervyn Goddings, head of Rosneft subsidiary RN-Vietnam, said the sanctions have forced the company to become more cautious and more proficient. “There is mild inconvenience. It means that we have to be a little more astute in how we operate, where we buy from. There is plenty of opportunities, plenty of diversity. It just means that we have to become more efficient, more effective and a better operator,” he said. “No experience is ever wasted. So, the lessons that we learn here are carried over, We are already a part of the greater Rosneft family. We have interchanging personnel. We have Russian staff come and work here,” he said.  Rosneft said that production offshore Vietnam is very profitable. Operational costs to produce gas stand at $1.5 per barrel of oil equivalent, half of what it usually costs the company.  Its Vietnamese operations are a legacy of Anglo-Russian firm TNK-BP, which it bought in 2013 for $55 billion. Rosneft controls 35 percent at Block 06.1 with initial reserves of 69 bcm of gas and owns a stake of around 33 percent in a pipeline that carries gas and condensate from blocks in the Nam Con Son basin to an onshore power generation facility. It also operates Block 05-3/11 with initial resources of 28 bcm of gas and 18 million tonnes of gas condensate. Currently, Rosneft performs exploration work there.

2018-05-15,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Just seven years ago, Noble Group (NOBG.SI) was an $11 billion-plus Asian commodity powerhouse, trading everything from soybeans to oil. Now it’s worth barely $80 million, rooted among Singapore’s penny stocks. Noble has posted huge losses provoked by a lack of trade financing and market calls that went sour, while also whittling down a mountain of debt. On Tuesday, it reported a narrower first-quarter loss than a year ago, although saying its performance was still beset by constraints on liquidity and trade finance. Shareholder meetings and legal rulings over the next few weeks will decide whether it survives.  Amid accusations of false accounting levelled in 2015 by Iceberg Research, and a legal spat this year, a long slide in investor confidence has seen most of Noble’s market value wiped out. Noble has defended its accounting and is now trying to clinch a last-ditch deal with creditors and shareholders from which - if it succeeds - it will emerge a transformed company. Noble is seeking approval to halve its $3.4 billion debt in return for handing over 70 percent of equity to senior creditors, mostly a group of hedge funds which calls itself the “Ad Hoc Group”. Under that plan, its headquarters will be in London, not Asia, no longer controlled by founder Richard Elman.  The deal would leave existing shareholders with just 15 percent equity in a company that has seen its share price fall from a peak of S$17.6 Singapore dollar ($13.18) in 2011 to below S$0.1. Despite its woes, Noble has so far defied talk of its demise. But to keep going, Noble needs a majority of its shareholders to approve the restructuring - a vote on the proposal is expected in June. (GRAPHIC: The rise & fall of Noble Group, reut.rs/2rHvYpk) Scared by the prospect of total loss and lack of any alternate plan, the proposal could get enough support, company sources say. Founder Elman, still Noble’s biggest shareholder with a stake of nearly 18 percent, would be given a board seat in the new firm. Noble chairman Paul Brough, a restructuring and liquidation expert, has urged shareholders to support the deal, threatening a failure would result in insolvency and bankruptcy. But leading the resistance is Abu Dhabi-based Goldilocks Investment Co. Ltd, which holds 8.1 percent in Noble. Goldilocks has filed complaints and lawsuits against the restructuring plans, arguing they protect creditors at the expense of shareholders. Goldilocks is Noble’s third-biggest shareholder after Elman and China Investment Corp, which has a 9.5 percent stake. It’s not just shareholders who are unhappy, though. One of Noble’s business partners, Indonesian coal miner PT Atlas Resources (ARII.JK), has also filed lawsuit against Noble and its chief executive William James Randall, alleging it was given false information related to asset sales. Shipping Indonesian coal to buyers in Asia is the biggest remaining business at Noble, which has said it plans to resist any and all allegations or claims made against it. In its glory days, Noble employed hundreds of traders, with ambitions to rival global rivals like Glencore (GLEN.L). But with its market value a shadow of what it once was, and billions in debt, Noble has struggled to remain active. Instead of trading itself out of trouble, it was forced to sell off its core businesses, including oil and gas, to competitors Vitol and Mercuria. This, as well as some bad trading calls, meant Noble booked a whopping $5 billion loss in 2017 - despite a broad commodity market recovery. As a result, Noble was unable to join a share-price rally enjoyed by rival miners and traders like Glencore or Whitehaven Coal (WHC.AX). For now, Noble fights on, seeking to make the best of its new look. Earlier in May, its gave a market presentation at a major coal trading event in Bali at which it described itself as “small, but nimble and motivated”.

2018-05-15,"OSLO, May 15 (Reuters) - Prices of Norwegian gas exports are likely to rise slightly this year amid strong demand, but will fall back in 2019 as liquefied natural gas (LNG) deliveries in Europe are expected to increase, the government said in its revised budget on Tuesday. Europe’s largest gas supplier after Russia forecast gas export prices would rise by 0.1 crowns per standard cubic metres (sm3) to average 1.8 crowns (22.43 U.S. cents) this year, due to longer-than-usual cold weather across Europe. High coal prices, reduced gas storage capacity in Europe and low access to hydro and nuclear power were also driving prices up, it said. Next year though, Europe is expected to receive more LNG, competing with Norway’s piped gas, the government said. “Next year, increased access to liquefied natural gas is expected in Europe to contribute to a decline in gas prices to just under 1.5 Norwegian crowns per sm3,” the government said in its revised budget. Over the long term, export prices are expected to rebound to 1.9 crowns/sm3, it said, without saying what would drive the rebound. After falling for four consecutive years from 2013 to 2016, Norway’s gas export price recovered to an average 1.7 crowns/sm3 last year.

2018-05-15,"TOKYO, May 15 (Reuters) - Japanese trading house Marubeni Corp said on Tuesday it has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Swedish battery manufacturer Northvolt AB to collaborate in a lithium-ion battery business to meet growing demand in Europe. Northvolt, whose Chief Executive Officer Peter Carlsson used to work for Tesla, plans to build Europe’s biggest battery cell plant in Sweden, with the backing of investors such as Volkswagen-owned truckmaker Scania and Swiss engineering group ABB. Marubeni is considering supplying Northvolt’s battery factory with manufacturing equipment such as coating and slitting machines as well as raw materials including cathode and anode materials, a company spokeswoman said. The Japanese trading company also plans to support the Swedish firm’s sales of storage batteries, using its know-how in the renewable energy business, while the two companies are looking at jointly developing an battery recycling business, it added. Energy storage is becoming increasingly important as production of renewable energy rises, because the wind might not blow or the sun shine during the peak hours when most consumers turn on their lights and appliances. Northvolt competes against rivals such as South Korea’s LG Chem to set up large-scale battery cell plants across Europe, where automakers and industrial firms have so far been largely reliant on Asian imports. Danish wind turbine maker Vestas has also signed a partnership deal with Northvolt. Asked whether Marubeni will invest in the Northvolt’s battery project, the spokeswoman declined to comment.

2018-05-15,"KARLSRUHE, Germany (Reuters) - Germany’s federal supreme court on Tuesday sentenced a former Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) employee to three years in prison for his role in a carbon emission permit trading scheme designed to curb global warming but used to fraudulently collect tens of millions of euros of sales tax. The ruling by the Federal Court of Justice affirmed the 2016 lower-court conviction of Helmut Hohnholz, formerly a regional sales manager with Deutsche’s global markets division.  The court also backed the judgements against three other former Deutsche bankers, who two years ago received suspended jail sentences. The case of one former employee of Deutsche’s tax accounting division was referred back to lower court as his active role in the crime could not be fully proven. The case stems from an investigation into so-called carousel trades in the European Union’s carbon market in 2009 and 2010, in which some buyers imported emissions permits into one EU country without paying value-added tax (VAT). The buyers sold the permits designed to put a price on pollution to each other, adding VAT to the price and generating tax refunds when no tax had been paid. European police agency Europol has estimated the cost to taxpayers at more than 5 billion euros (4.4 billion pounds) since 2008. Hohnholz had been accused of ignoring all question marks over the scheme.  According to the judge presiding the 2016 trial, he had coordinated the trading of carbon emissions in Germany for Deutsche and was “the culprit, not the helper” in collecting 145 million euros of taxes. The scheme had been run purely to trick tax authorities out of a total of 220 million euros and had revealed a “failure of all security mechanisms” at Deutsche Bank, the judge had said at the time. The trial followed a years-long probe that involved trawling millions of emails and thousands of recorded telephone conversations. Of the seven former Deutsche Bank employees originally on trial in Frankfurt, two had accepted the court ruling, while five had appealed it. The prosecutors had also appealed the ruling, criticising that four of the defendants had not been sentenced as culprits, but only as accessories to the tax fraud.  Deutsche Bank had repaid the tax, changed its internal processes and parted with the staff involved. It declined to comment on Tuesday. Germany’s flagship lender is in the throes of a major restructuring, hamstrung by having to pay out billions of euros of fines to end a slew of legal rows.

MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.3 percent. Europe’s benchmark Stoxx 600 was 0.1 percent lower while Germany’s DAX shed 0.2 percent as first-quarter economic growth in the country came in lower than expected. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.8 percent. China reported weaker-than-expected investment and retail sales in April and a drop in home sales, clouding its economic outlook even as policymakers try to navigate debt risks and defuse a heated trade row with the United States. Mixed messages in U.S.-China trade talks also weighed on sentiment. The two countries are still “very far apart” on resolving trade frictions, U.S. ambassador to China Terry Branstad said on Tuesday as a second round of high-level talks was set to begin in Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump drew ire from lawmakers after suggesting he would help Chinese firm ZTE Corp, that flouted U.S. sanctions on trade with Iran and North Korea, with intelligence officials also saying the decision threatens national security. “Sino-US trade negotiations have provided mixed signals, the White House promising conciliation (over ZTE) then indicating that some form of punishment is still in the cards,” said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets. In fixed income, the U.S. 10-year bond yield rose above the key level of 3 percent, sending borrowing costs higher in a number of other countries and supporting the dollar. The 10-year yield was last trading at 3.0226 percent, just off levels not seen since January 2014. In Europe, the benchmark German bond yield rose 14 basis points to 0.629 percent, with investors also taking note of hawkish commentary from Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau, who said the European Central Bank could soon give guidance on its first rate hike. “We have this Galhau interview and he was very much pointing to rate hikes after the end of QE (quantitative easing),” said DZ Bank rates strategist Daniel Lenz, explaining the weakness in euro zone debt markets. “And we still have a high oil price and U.S. Treasury yields above 3 percent.” Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar index gained 0.18 percent. Oil prices were stable on Tuesday as ongoing production cuts by OPEC and looming U.S. sanctions against Iran threatened to tighten the market amid signs of ongoing strong demand. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, rose to as much as $78.62 per barrel, touching a 3-1/2-year high. “The commitment of Saudi Arabia and the rest of OPEC to the production cuts is a major factor in supporting the price at the moment as well as the possibility of reduced exports from Iran due to sanctions,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Rivkin Securities.

2018-05-15,"* Natural gas-to-hydrogen has “huge” potential -Woodside * Japan pushing to switch towards a hydrogen economy * Could use solar to help power gas-to-hydrogen conversion ADELAIDE, May 15 (Reuters) - Australian gas could find a big new outlet in its traditional top export market, Japan, as the country pushes to switch to clean hydrogen fuel, the chief executive of Woodside Petroleum said on Tuesday. Woodside CEO Peter Coleman said the opportunity was “huge” beyond 2030, by when he expected hydrogen fuel to be in production in large volumes worldwide, for fuel cells that could power cars and factories. Japan is pushing to power the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 with hydrogen, as part of a long term drive towards a hydrogen economy. Japanese firms are working on pilot projects in Norway and Australia to produce hydrogen fuel using wind power and coal. “It’s a game changer - hydrogen,” Coleman told reporters. Woodside has discussed the prospects of shipping hydrogen with Japan’s Chiyoda Corp, Coleman said. For Woodside the opportunity would be to use gas it produces off Western Australia to convert to ammonia and then liquid hydrogen to export to Japan. It makes more sense to produce hydrogen in Australia and then ship it, rather than sending liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Japan to make hydrogen as the production process requires a lot of energy, which Japan is short on, Coleman said. Woodside is looking to tap the abundant sunshine in Western Australia’s Pilbara region for the energy needed to release hydrogen from methane. As a first step, the company is considering switching its North West Shelf LNG plant to be powered by solar energy and batteries, instead of gas, which Coleman estimated would cost hundreds of millions of dollars. That would be justifiable once Australia’s oldest and largest LNG plant secures gas supply to keep operating beyond 2025. “It makes economic sense to do it,” Coleman told reporters. The switch would free up more gas for sale and would also have environmental benefits, as 70 percent of the plant’s carbon emissions currently come from burning gas for power and running compressors. About 7 percent of gas produced for the North West Shelf plant is used to generate power and run compressors at the plant. The main byproduct from producing hydrogen from gas would be carbon, which Woodside could decide to bury or use for other purposes such as carbon fibre, Coleman said. Reporting by Sonali Paul

As it readies its latest earnings report, it’s worth barely $80 million, rooted among Singapore’s penny stocks.

Despite its woes, Noble has so far defied talk of its demise. But to keep going, Noble needs a majority of its shareholders to approve the restructuring - a vote on the proposal is expected in June. Scared by the prospect of total loss and lack of any alternate plan, the proposal could get enough support, company sources say. Founder Elman, still Noble’s biggest shareholder with a stake of nearly 18 percent, would be given a board seat in the new firm. Noble chairman Paul Brough, a restructuring and liquidation expert, has urged shareholders to support the deal, threatening a failure would result in insolvency and bankruptcy. But leading the resistance is Abu Dhabi-based Goldilocks Investment Co. Ltd, which holds 8.1 percent in Noble. Goldilocks has filed complaints and lawsuits against the restructuring plans, arguing they protect creditors at the expense of shareholders. Goldilocks is Noble’s third-biggest shareholder after Elman and China Investment Corp, which has a 9.5 percent stake. It’s not just shareholders who are unhappy, though. One of Noble’s business partners, Indonesian coal miner PT Atlas Resources, has also filed lawsuit against Noble and its chief executive William James Randall, alleging it was given false information related to asset sales. Shipping Indonesian coal to buyers in Asia is the biggest remaining business at Noble, which has said it plans to resist any and all allegations or claims made against it. In its glory days, Noble employed hundreds of traders, with ambitions to rival global rivals like Glencore. But with its market value a shadow of what it once was, and billions in debt, Noble has struggled to remain active. Instead of trading itself out of trouble, it was forced to sell off its core businesses, including oil and gas, to competitors Vitol and Mercuria. This, as well as some bad trading calls, meant Noble booked a whopping $5 billion loss in 2017 - despite a broad commodity market recovery. As a result, Noble was unable to join a share-price rally enjoyed by rival miners and traders like Glencore or Whitehaven Coal. For now, Noble fights on, seeking to make the best of its new look. Earlier in May, its gave a market presentation at a major coal trading event in Bali at which it described itself as “small, but nimble and motivated”.

2018-05-15,"OSLO (Reuters) - Shareholders in Norway’s largest company, Statoil STL.OL, will approve on Tuesday the board’s proposal to drop “oil” from its name as its seeks to diversify its business and attract young talent concerned about fossil fuels’ impact on climate change. From Wednesday, the majority state-owned company will change its 46-year-old name to Equinor and trade on the Oslo Exchange under the new ticker EQNR.  The Norwegian government, which has a 67 percent stake in the firm, has said it will back the move. The oil and gas company said the name change was a natural step after it decided last year to become a “broad energy” firm, investing up to 15-20 percent of annual capital expenditure in “new energy solutions” by 2030, mostly in offshore wind. “The key reason for a company to change its name is when it wants to widen the scope of its activity or direction. Another reason would be because it is in trouble, and it has a reputational problem,” Allyson Stewart-Allen, a London-based international branding expert and the CEO of International Marketing Partners, told Reuters. “I don’t believe that’s the case with Statoil.” While the company’s profits are growing again, its hydrocarbon business has come under increased scrutiny after the Paris climate deal in 2016. “A name with ‘oil’ as a component would increasingly be a disadvantage. None of our competitors has that. It served us really well for 50 years, I don’t think it will be the best name for the next 50 years,” Eldar Saetre, Statoil’s chief executive, told Reuters. The new name was meant to arouse curiosity among young people so they see the other aspects of Statoil, including renewable energy, he added.  Technology students became less interested in working for oil firms after oil prices crashed in 2014 and renewable energy gained in prominence. Statoil ranked 15th in an annual survey of the Nordic country’s most attractive employers conducted by karrierestart.no, a Norwegian careers website, and Norwegian firm Evidente, published on May 3. In 2013, it ranked first. There are signs, however, that the name change could help it climb the ranks. “Students who answered the survey after (news of) the name change found Statoil to be between 5 percent and 10 percent more attractive as an employer,” Arne Kvalsvik at Evidente said. “It’s likely that Statoil’s name change will have a positive impact on its reputation going forward.” Statoil said it remained the first choice among technology students, citing another survey by Swedish firm Universum. Truls Gulowsen, head of Greenpeace Norway, said the name change would not be sufficient to improve Statoil’s image as long as the firm was exploring in vulnerable areas, such as the Arctic or the Great Australian Bight.

2018-05-15,"OSLO (Reuters) - An architect of the Paris climate agreement urged governments on Tuesday to halt oil exploration in the Arctic, saying drilling was not economical and warming threatened the environmentally fragile region. Christiana Figueres, formerly head of the U.N. Climate Change Secretariat when the Paris accord was reached by almost 200 nations in 2015, told Reuters by telephone “the Arctic has been rendered undrillable.” The past three years have been the hottest since records began in the 19th century, and Figueres said the heat was a threat to everything from Australia’s Great Barrier Reef to ice in Antarctica. The former Costa Rican diplomat who campaigns for a peak in global emissions by 2020 said it made no economic sense to explore in the Arctic, partly because it was likely to take years to develop any finds. Capital investment would be better used developing renewable energies such as solar and wind to cut emissions, she said. “The stakes are visibly higher than they were just a few years ago,” she said. Figueres will give a speech in Oslo on Tuesday at the Business for Peace Foundation, which seeks to promote ethical business practices. The Paris Agreement sets a goal of ending the fossil fuel era in the second half of this century. It has been weakened by a planned pullout by U.S. President Donald Trump, who doubts mainstream scientific findings that global warming is man-made. Many governments and companies favour Arctic drilling. Last month, Trump’s administration began environmental reviews for oil and gas drilling in a section of the Arctic national Wildlife Refuge. In Norway, Statoil STL.OL and other companies plan to keep up exploration in the Arctic Barents Sea, which is ice-free further north than other parts of the Arctic thanks to the warm Gulf Stream..  “This area is actually less challenging in terms of weather and waves than many other parts of Norway ... We have drilled more than 100 wells, and never had any significant accidents or discharges to sea,” Statoil spokesman Bård Glad Pedersen said. Although Figueres said drilling in the Arctic did not make sense, Pedersen said the Johan Castberg field, due to start pumping in the early 2020s off north Norway, would have a break-even of $31 a barrel. Global warming is also making the Arctic - shared by Nordic nations, Russia, Canada and the United States - more accessible to shipping and mineral exploration.

2018-05-15,"OSLO (Reuters) - Europe’s bottled water producers set a goal on Tuesday of raising collection rates of plastic bottles to 90 percent by 2025 from 60 percent to improve recycling and cut pollution. “Our packaging today is part of the unacceptable phenomenon of littering alongside other discarded items,” the European Federation of Bottled Waters said in a statement. The Federation, which represents national associations and several major companies, said the new industry goal was to collect 90 percent of all PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles by 2025, as an average across the European Union. Almost 60 percent of PET bottles are now collected for recycling, although with big national variations. The Federation did not say exactly how the goal would be achieved, nor did it give costs. Some countries such as Germany impose high deposits on bottles to encourage recycling. Britain plans this year to introduce a deposit return scheme for single-use drink containers. The Federation also said it would work with the recycling industry “to use at least 25 percent recycled PET in its water bottles by 2025, as an EU average”. It says that the average EU citizen drinks about 110 litres of bottled water a year.

2018-05-15," ADELAIDE (Reuters) - How can Australia’s oil and gas industry, on the cusp of becoming the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), have failed so comprehensively in the public relations battle against environmental activists? This was the question posed by Kevin Gallagher, chief executive of Santos Ltd, the country’s No. 2 oil and gas producer, to the annual conference of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association. It’s taken several years, but the country’s LNG producers have finally realised there is mounting public anger against their industry, and they are very much on the back foot when it comes to telling what they believe is a positive story. The public relations problems for the industry have been brewing for several years, but have been greatly exacerbated in the past year by a combination of factors. These include sharply higher natural gas prices for domestic consumers and a well-orchestrated campaign by green activists against the industry. This environmental campaign attacks the industry on several levels, from claiming that onshore natural gas production is unsafe and will damage farmland, to articulating that the rise of Australia’s LNG export industry has raised prices and starved domestic consumers of supply, to drawing a direct link between natural gas production and climate change. Not all of these arguments stand up to scrutiny, but the industry has been slow to realise that relying on reasoned and science-based arguments when its opponents are using populism and fear and outrage is a losing position. What the industry has taken too long to realise is that in the court of public opinion it doesn’t matter that 13 different government inquiries have found that extracting natural gas is safe as long as it is properly regulated, if the populace believes the scare-mongering of activists and farmers. A refusal to engage has cost the industry credibility, and rebuilding a public image of LNG producers as a valuable contributor to society will take time, despite the $200 billion the industry has invested over the past decade to build eight new LNG projects. Zoe Yujnovich, chairwoman of Royal Dutch Shell’s operations in Australia and also of APPEA, told the conference the industry was well received and respected in the largely remote communities where its operations are located, but vilified and distrusted in Australia’s large cities. “So, a question we must answer is: Why is there such a gulf in perception from the regional areas where we operate to the commentators and activists of the inner city who rely on our products?” she said. Yujnovich said the industry has been unwilling to engage in conversations with other Australians, and when it has, it has chosen to avoid challenging or confrontational dialogue. In effect, the industry has sat in its ivory tower, believing that science backs its positions and that its products provide the energy the community needs. It’s this sort of disengagement that has allowed the industry to be tarred with the narrative that it doesn’t contribute its fair share of taxes, that it is sending Australians’ natural resources offshore for its own profit, and that it is responsible for surging domestic prices for natural gas and electricity. There is an element of truth to the pricing argument against the industry, insofar as the establishment of three LNG export plants on the east coast in Queensland state has effectively linked the domestic natural gas price to Asian LNG prices. Instead of recognising the issue, the industry pushed back against government plans to ensure that domestic gas supply needs were met before the demands of the LNG plants. The industry has also been largely ineffectual in lobbying the various state and territory governments to open up more onshore exploration areas and end bans that have been imposed. The Australian states of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania all have some form of ban or restriction on natural gas exploration and production, and the Northern Territory just lifted a ban on hydraulic fracturing after a government inquiry found the risks could be managed. There are several steps the Australian natural gas industry can take to improve its public image and rebuild trust. The first is to cooperate with each other to ensure the domestic market is well supplied at prices that will allow industrial companies to continue to be competitive, thus preventing them from shifting operations offshore. The second is to ensure that governments realise that increasing supply is a key way of delivering cheaper prices. And the third is to do more than just engage communities where they operate, but also to talk to people in the cities as to what the industry actually delivers, and what it can’t.

2018-05-15,"* MSCI Asia-Pacific index down 0.8 pct, Nikkei loses 0.1 pct * Spreadbetters expect European stocks to open lower * Brent crude hovers just below 3-1/2-yr highs * Dollar supported with 10-yr Treasury yield above 3 pct threshold By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, May 15 (Reuters) - Asian stocks pulled back on Tuesday, brushing off a firmer lead from Wall Street, as investors turned cautious after soft Chinese economic data and awaited fresh developments on U.S.-China trade talks and North Korea. Crude oil prices held near 3-1/2-year highs on supply concerns, while the dollar edged higher, underpinned by a rise in U.S. bond yields. Spreadbetters expected European stocks to follow their Asian peers lower, with Britain’s FTSE, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC all seen shedding 0.2 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.8 percent after rising the previous day to its highest since late March. The index had rallied for three straight sessions prior to Tuesday. Japan’s Nikkei dipped 0.1 percent, with its surge to a three-month peak bogging down. “The markets appear to be taking a breather after their recent surge, awaiting fresh developments in matters such as U.S.-China trade issues and Washington’s upcoming summit with North Korea,” said Yoshinori Shigemi, global markets strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management in Tokyo. The two countries are still “very far apart” on resolving trade frictions, U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad said on Tuesday as a second round of high-level talks was set to begin in Washington. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng lost 0.9 percent, pulling back from a two-month peak to snap a five-day winning run, while Shanghai slipped 0.2 percent. China reported weaker-than-expected investment and retail sales in April and a drop in home sales, clouding its economic outlook even as policymakers try to navigate debt risks and defuse a heated trade row with the United States. The downbeat economic news temporarily offset optimism over further foreign inflows into Chinese stocks ahead of their inclusion in MSCI’s widely tracked equity benchmarks from June 1. Investors in Chinese equities will likely have to re-jig their exposure after the U.S. index publisher made some last-minute tweaks in its index weightings on Tuesday. MSCI said 234 Chinese large caps will be included in its global and regional indexes next month. Wall Street scraped out gains on Monday after weakness in defensive stocks offset optimism following U.S. President Donald Trump’s conciliatory remarks toward China’s ZTE Corp that helped calm U.S.-China trade tensions. While higher oil prices sometimes raise inflation concerns, the recent crude oil surge - Brent has risen 17 percent so far in 2018 - was seen to be generally supportive for equities. “The recent rise in prices of crude oil won’t have a broadly negative impact on equity markets if it continues at the current pace,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. “The rise in oil prices is boding well for certain stock sectors like energy shares.” Brent crude added 6 cents to $78.29 a barrel, nearing a 3-1/2-year high marked on Monday. U.S. crude oil futures advanced 2 cents to $70.98 and in reach of its highest level since November 2014 scaled on Thursday. Oil prices received their latest lift as OPEC reported that the global oil glut has been virtually eliminated. Tensions in the Middle East and uncertainty about output from Iran amid renewed U.S. sanctions have contributed to the recent rise in oil prices. “The commitment of Saudi Arabia and the rest of OPEC to the production cuts is a major factor in supporting the price at the moment as well as the possibility of reduced exports from Iran due to sanctions,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Rivkin Securities. In currencies, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies gained 0.3 percent to 92.801. The greenback took a knock against the euro earlier on Monday after European Central Bank policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said the ECB could give fresh timing guidance of its first rate hike as the end of its exceptional bond purchases approaches. The U.S. currency managed to bounce back, however, after Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester reiterated support for gradual interest rate increases. The euro lost 0.1 percent to $1.1913 after pulling back sharply from the previous day’s high of $1.1996. The dollar was 0.25 percent higher at 109.920 yen, adding to the previous day’s gains. The currency drew support as U.S. Treasury yields rose amid the easing of U.S.-China trade tensions. The 10-year Treasury note yield extended its overnight rise and brushed a 12-day high of 3.021 percent.

2018-05-15,"PAHOA, Hawaii (Reuters) - Lava flowing from giant rips in the earth on the flank of Hawaii’s erupting Kilauea volcano threatened highways on Monday, raising the possibility officials may order thousands more people to evacuate before escape routes are cut off. Lava from a huge new fissure tore through farmland towards a coastal dirt road that is one of the last exit routes for some 2,000 residents in the southeast area of Hawaii’s Big Island. More lava-belching cracks are expected to open among homes and countryside some 25 miles (40 km) east of Kilauea’s smoking summit, possibly blocking one of the last exit routes, Highway 132. Fountains of magma spouted “lava bombs” more than 100 feet (30 meters) into the air as the molten rock traveled east-southeast towards the coastal road - Highway 137 - the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said. Mass evacuations would be triggered if either highway is hit by lava, said Hawaii National Guard spokesman Jeff Hickman. “There’s a lot of worst-case scenarios and roads getting blocked is one of them,” said Hickman, standing on Highway 137, in the potential path of the lava flow, some two miles (3 km) away. Dozens of homes have been destroyed since eruptions began 10 days ago and officials have ordered the evacuations of nearly 2,000 residents in the lower Puna district of the Big Island, home to around 187,000 people. The American Red Cross said 500 people sought refuge in its shelters on Sunday night because of worsening volcanic activity. Two more fissures opened in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 19. “It’s optimistic to think that this is the last fissure we’re going to see,” said Hawaiian Volcano Observatory Deputy Scientist-In-Charge Steve Brantley. A similar seismic event in 1955 lasted 88 days, he said. Unnerved by near-constant small earthquakes and emissions of toxic sulfur dioxide gas, Rob Guzman and his husband Bob Kirk left their home in Kalapana Seaview Estates while they still could.  “We just need the local government to calm down the panic that some of these 2,000 people are feeling, that today, we’re going to be trapped with no way out,” said Guzman, who left behind a banana farm and rental properties to go stay with friends. The Hawaii Fire Department issued a “condition red” alert on Monday because fissures in the southeast area of the Lanipuna Gardens area were issuing high levels of sulfur dioxide.  “Condition RED means immediate danger to health so take action to limit further exposure. Severe conditions may exist such as choking and inability to breathe,” the department said in the alert. While residents deal with noxious gas and lava on the ground, the U.S. Geological Survey is concerned that pent-up steam could cause a violent explosive eruption at the volcano crater, launching a 20,000-foot (6,100-meter) plume that could spread debris over 12 miles (19 km). Scientists had expected such explosions by the middle of this month as Kilauea’s lava lake fell below the water table. The possibility exists, however, that water may not be entering the crater, as feared, and gas and steam may be safely venting, scientists said. “So far those explosions have not occurred and I think the key here is that the vent system is an open one, therefore pressure is not being built or developed down at the top of the lava column,” Brantley told a conference call.

2018-05-15,"NEW YORK/LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil futures prices have soared past three-year highs, OPEC’s deal has cut millions of barrels of inventory worldwide and investors are betting in record numbers that prices could rocket past $80 and even hit $90 a barrel this year.  But physical markets for oil shipments tell a different story. Spot crude prices are at their steepest discounts to futures prices in years due to weak demand from refiners in China and a backlog of cargoes in Europe. Sellers are struggling to find buyers for West African, Russian and Kazakh cargoes, while pipeline bottlenecks trap supply in west Texas and Canada.  The divergence is notable because traditionally, physical markets are viewed as a better gauge of short-term fundamentals. Crude traders who peddle cargoes to refineries worldwide say speculators are on shaky ground as they drive futures markets above $70 a barrel, their highest levels for three-and-a-half years, on concerns about tighter supply from Venezuela and the potential impact of U.S. sanctions on supply from Iran.     Investors have piled millions of dollars in record wagers in the options market, betting on a further rally on the back of rising geopolitical tensions, particularly in Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, and the global decline in supply.  “Guys who are trading futures have a view that draws are coming and big draws are coming,” a U.S.-based crude trader at a global commodity merchant said, adding that demand could ramp up as global refinery maintenance ends.  “Over the next few weeks, we should start to see markets globally clean up, but if that doesn’t happen, I think we could be in trouble.”  Brent LCOc1, the benchmark on which two-thirds of the world’s oil is priced, has surpassed $78 a barrel, the highest since November 2014. U.S. crude futures CLc1 hit a high just short of $72.  Inventories in the developed world are now just 9 million barrels above the five-year average, down from 340 million barrels above the average in January 2017, after supply cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia. In the last few weeks, expectations that U.S. President Donald Trump would withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement added to bullishness. Following Trump’s announcement making good on that threat last week, prices surged further. Analysts estimate anywhere from 200,000 to 1 million bpd could be cut from global exports next year. “Any reduction in Iranian supply will likely exacerbate market deficits, suggesting upward pressure on pricing,” wrote Greg Sharenow, PIMCO commodities portfolio manager, which sees oil surpassing $80 in the short term. In the weeks before Trump’s decision, hedge funds and others piled a record number of bets into bullish crude oil options. Traders currently hold a record 21.3 million barrels worth of options that pay off if the December Brent contract hits $90 by late October LCO9000L8. Bets that U.S. crude will hit $85 a barrel CL850G8 by mid-June are currently at a record above 14,000 contracts.  These bets are being made due to strong demand, not just fear of political destabilization, said Scott Shelton, energy futures broker with ICAP in Durham, North Carolina. “The bigger picture of demand keeping up with supply...is much more important,” Shelton said. Those on the front lines of the physical market are not convinced. Traders say the surge in U.S. exports to more than 2 million bpd has saturated some markets, leaving benchmark prices ripe for a correction.  “There is a huge disconnect between futures and fundamentals,” a trader with a Chinese independent refiner said. “I won’t be surprised if prices correct by $20 a barrel.” Increased U.S. competition has dented sales of oil from Nigeria and Azerbaijan, which produce similar quality oil and compete for buyers in Europe and Latin America. Physical prices have sunk even as benchmarks on which they are based stay buoyant. The strength of Brent crude, now trading at nearly $7 above U.S. futures WTCLc1-LCOc1, and $4 above Dubai, DUB-EFS-1M has made it hard to find buyers for grades priced off Brent. Russian Urals hit a seven-year discount against dated Brent BFO-URL-NWE while Kazakh CPC Blend BFO-CPC crashed to its weakest since mid-2012 this month. Separately, shipments of West African crude to Asia hit a five-month low in April due to a backlog at Chinese ports.    Clogged pipelines have hit key U.S. oil grades, including in west Texas WTC-WTM WTC-WTS, where the discount to U.S. crude is near its widest in three years. Some are confident the world’s refineries will gobble up these barrels when they finish seasonal maintenance. About 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is expected to be offline through June. “For the last three, four, five months we’ve seen high turnarounds globally,” a U.S. crude trader said, referencing maintenance works. “Once you get past that, all of a sudden (you’re) looking at 3 million barrels per day of fresh crude consumption.” But whether that is enough to support Brent at $80 and above is yet to be seen. “I think it’s touch and go,” he added.

2018-05-15,"(Recasts, adds analyst comment, detail) * April runs at 12.06 mln bpd, 2nd highest behind March record * Jan-April runs averaged 12.1 mln bpd, up 9 pct on year * Generous govt quotas, healthy margins support high runs * Slowdown expected as more plant maintenance planned from May By Chen Aizhu and Meng Meng BEIJING, May 15 (Reuters) - China’s refinery runs rose nearly 12 percent in April compared with the same month a year ago, hitting the second-highest level on record on a daily basis, buoyed by generous government quotas and healthy refining margins, data showed on Tuesday. April throughput grew to 49.58 million tonnes, 11.5 percent higher than in the same month last year, according to data released by the National Statistical Bureau on Tuesday, equivalent to 12.06 million barrels per day (bpd) - a touch below an all-time high of 12.13 million bpd in March. Production in the first four months of the year totalled 199.12 million tonnes, up 9.1 percent from a year ago, according to the National Statistical Bureau. On a daily basis, average January-April runs stood at a near-record of 12.1 million bpd. “The rapid growth in crude runs was due to big increases in crude oil import quotas and refined fuel export quotas,” the bureau said in a statement. Li Yan, analyst with Shandong-based Longzhong Information Group said the hefty refinery production level showed plants have been ramping up output on healthy margins, as the cargoes that arrived last month were purchased at a much lower price. Global benchmark Brent crude futures have climbed to multi-year highs above $78 on Tuesday, bolstered by jitters about disrupted Middle East oil supply after the United States scrapped a 2015 Iran nuclear deal. “Independent refiners have also become more deft in risk control - engaging in more hedging activities when prices were lower,” said Li. The lofty run levels came despite planned overhauls at a few state-run oil plants in April. More maintenance at both state-owned and independent plants are expected from May. Refineries that shut in April include Sinopec’s Tahe and Anqing refineries, and PetroChina’s Sichuan refinery. April’s domestic crude oil production fell 2.3 percent from the same month a year ago to 15.51 million tonnes, or 3.774 million bpd, slightly higher than March’s 3.76 million bpd. Year-to-date output was 62.25 million tonnes, down 2.1 percent from January-April last year.

2018-05-15,"NEW DELHI, May 15 (Reuters) - India’s ruling party was running neck-and-neck with the main opposition Congress in a southern state on Monday, an early vote count showed, in an election seen as a measure of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s popularity ahead of general elections next year. Karnataka, now ruled by the Congress party, is home to India’s Silicon Valley capital of Bengaluru. It is the first big state electing an assembly this year and will be followed by three more. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party was leading in 76 seats in the elections to the 225-seat assembly in Karnataka, versus 74 for Congress, the Times Now news channel said. Another channel, NDTV, showed the BJP leading in 62 seats and Congress in 63. Investors are watching the contest closely as they worry a loss for Modi would force him to double down on populist measures, such as extending farm loan waivers a year before the 2019 elections. If Modi failed to capture the state, that would re-energise Congress under Rahul Gandhi, the fifth-generation scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that is trying to exploit dissatisfaction over a lack of jobs for young people and rising fuel prices. Both Gandhi and Modi addressed rallies across the state to drum up support.

2018-05-15,"* MSCI Asia-Pacific index down 0.65 pct, Nikkei shade lower * Brent crude hovers just below 3-1/2-yr highs * Dollar mildly supported after bouncing on Fed Mester’s comments By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, May 15 (Reuters) - Asian stocks pulled back on Tuesday, brushing off a firmer Wall Street lead and pausing a recent rally, as investors remained cautious about key economic and political risks, while supply concerns kept crude oil prices near 3-1/2-year highs. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.65 percent after rising the previous day to its highest since late March. The index had rallied for three straight sessions prior to Tuesday. “The markets appear to be taking a breather after their recent surge, awaiting fresh developments in matters such as U.S.-China trade issues and Washington’s upcoming summit with North Korea,” said Yoshinori Shigemi, global markets strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management in Tokyo. Australian stocks were down 0.35 percent after briefly touching a four-month high and South Korea’s KOSPI shed 0.55 percent. Japan’s Nikkei was a shade lower, its surge to a three-month peak bogging down. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng lost 0.5 percent, pulling back from a two-month peak to snap a five-day winning run and Shanghai inched up 0.05 percent. Investors in Chinese equities will likely re-jig their exposure after MSCI, the U.S. index publisher, published its latest index weighting. MSCI said on Tuesday that 234 Chinese large caps will be partially included in its global and regional indexes on June 1, following an index review ahead of China’s inclusion in MSCI’s widely tracked equity benchmarks. Wall Street scraped out gains on Monday after weakness in defensive stocks offset optimism following U.S. President Donald Trump’s conciliatory remarks toward China’s ZTE Corp that helped calm U.S.-China trade tensions. While higher oil prices sometimes raise inflation concerns, the recent crude oil surge - Brent has risen 17 percent so far in 2018 - was seen to be generally supportive for equities. “The recent rise in prices of crude oil won’t have a broadly negative impact on equity markets if it continues at the current pace,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. “The rise in oil prices is boding well for certain stock sectors like energy shares.” Brent crude added 4 cents to $78.27 a barrel and in close reach of $78.53, the 3-1/2-year high marked on Monday. U.S. crude oil futures advanced 0.4 cents to $71.00 a barrel and in reach of $71.89, the highest since November 2014 scaled on Thursday. Oil prices received their latest lift as OPEC reported that the global oil glut has been virtually eliminated. Tensions in the Middle East and uncertainty about output from Iran amid renewed U.S. sanctions have contributed to the recent rise in oil prices. “The commitment of Saudi Arabia and the rest of OPEC to the production cuts is a major factor in supporting the price at the moment as well as the possibility of reduced exports from Iran due to sanctions,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Rivkin Securities. In currencies, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies nudged up 0.05 percent to 92.643. The greenback took a knock against the euro earlier on Monday after European Central Bank policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said the ECB could give fresh timing guidance of its first rate hike as the end of its exceptional bond purchases approaches. The U.S. currency managed to bounce back, however, after Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester reiterated support for gradual interest rate increases. The euro stood little changed at $1.1933 after pulling back sharply from the previous day’s high of $1.1996. The dollar was a shade higher at 109.745 yen, adding to the previous day’s gains. The currency drew support as U.S. Treasury yields rose amid the easing of U.S.-China trade tensions. The 10-year Treasury note yield was at 2.998 percent after rising about 2.5 basis points overnight.

April’s production was also an increase from 290 million tonnes in March, which was the weakest level since October. For the January-April period, output climbed to 1.1 billion tonnes, up 3.8 percent compared with the same period of last year. “The top three coal-producing regions Shanxi, Sha’anxi and Inner Mongolia ramped out their supplies in the first four months”, the statistics bureau said in a statement, adding that imports in April fell sharply. China’s second-largest producer, China Coal Energy Co., previously said it produced 6.4 million tonnes of coal in April, up more than 6 percent compared with the same period last year. China adopted tighter anti-pollution restrictions on imports of the fuel in the eastern provinces of Zhejiang, Guangxi and Fujian, helping thermal coal prices bottom out from an eight-month low on April 13. Meanwhile, coke output in April fell 3.6 percent from the same month a year ago to 36.72 million tonnes, but still stood at its highest monthly level since September 2017.

2018-05-15,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne reprimanded the company’s top U.S. spokesman for issuing press releases about Fiat’s vehicle emissions practices days after Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) disclosure in September 2015 that the German automaker had used illegal software to evade emissions tests, documents released Monday show. Lawyers suing Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCAU.N) in a securities case filed excerpts of an email from Marchionne to Gualberto Ranieri, then the company’s U.S. spokesman, in a filing in federal court in New York criticizing him for saying that the company does not use defeat devices. “Are you out of your goddam mind?” Marchionne wrote in an email on Sept. 22, 2015, adding that Ranieri should be fired and calling his actions “utterly stupid and unconscionable.” The company said in a statement on Monday it was “understandable that our CEO would have a forceful response to any employee who would opine on such a significant and complex matter, without the matter having been fully reviewed through its appropriate channels.” The statement added that Ranieri’s comments came just days after VW’s emissions issue became public “and before a comprehensive internal review and discussions with component suppliers was possible.” Fiat Chrysler was sued in 2015 along with Marchionne and other executives over claims it defrauded shareholders by overstating its ability to comply with vehicle safety laws. An amended version of the complaint filed in 2017 added claims about its compliance with emissions laws. The shareholders accused the defendants of inflating Fiat Chrysler’s share price by hundreds of millions of dollars from October 2014 to October 2015 by downplaying safety concerns. They said the shortcomings materialized in 2015 when the automaker was fined $175 million by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and took a roughly $670 million charge for recalls. Plaintiffs filed the excerpts seeking approval to take up to 40 additional depositions, including Marchionne’s. The U.S. Justice Department sued Fiat Chrysler in May 2017, accusing it of illegally using software to bypass emission controls in 104,000 diesel vehicles sold since 2014. Fiat Chrysler has held numerous rounds of settlement talks with the Justice Department and California Air Resources Board to settle the civil suit, including talks as recently as earlier this month. It faces a separate criminal probe into the matter. The Justice Department sent Fiat Chrysler lawyers a Jan. 27 settlement offer that would require the company to offset excess pollution and take steps to prevent future excess emissions, Reuters reported in February. The letter included language that a settlement must include very substantial civil penalties. Regulators have said Fiat Chrysler diesel vehicles had undisclosed emissions controls that allowed vehicles to emit excess pollution during normal driving. The company has denied wrongdoing, saying it never engaged in any deliberate scheme to cheat emissions rules. In a separate court filing Monday in Detroit, lawyers filed amended class-action lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler and Cummins Inc (CMI.N) asserted there were at least two diesel emissions defeat devices installed in 2007-2012 Dodge Ram 2500 and 3500 trucks to evade emissions testing after a prior version was dismissed in March. Both companies have denied wrongdoing.

2018-05-15,"(Repeats without change. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2rFWRdl By John Kemp LONDON, May 14 (Reuters) - Hedge funds have continued to pare their bullish positions in petroleum despite the continued rise in prices and the prospect of renewed sanctions reducing exports from Iran. The net long position of hedge funds and other money managers in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts was cut by a further 21 million barrels in the week to May 8. The combined net long has now been reduced by a total of 55 million barrels in the three most recent weeks, according to position reports published by regulators and exchanges. As in previous weeks, the liquidation last week was concentrated in crude, while funds' exposure to refined products was increased slightly (tmsnrt.rs/2rFWRdl). Portfolio managers cut their net long position in NYMEX and ICE WTI (-9 million barrels) and Brent (-22 million barrels) for a third and fourth week respectively. By contrast, net long positions were increased slightly in U.S. gasoline (+1 million barrels), U.S. heating oil (+7 million barrels) and European gasoil (+2 million barrels). For all the bullish commentary around the outlook for oil prices, fund managers appear to be taking profits after a strong rally in crude oil rather than adding new positions. Even the threat of tough sanctions on Iran’s crude exports does not seem to have encouraged funds to increase their exposure to oil. The exception is middle distillates, such as diesel and heating oil, where global consumption is growing fast, inventories are declining and the market is looking increasingly tight. Fund positioning remains stretched, with longs outnumbering shorts by 12:1 across the whole petroleum complex and by as much as 14:1 in the case of Brent. While fundamentals still appear supportive, higher oil prices are likely to restrain consumption growth and stimulate more supply in the second half of 2018 and into 2019. Against this backdrop, the extremely lopsided positioning could become a significant source of downside risk if and when portfolio managers try to exit some of their positions. As a result, most managers appear to be looking to lock in some profits after an extraordinary bull run in which oil prices have risen by 75 percent since June 2017.

2018-05-15,"* Tight supplies come amid strong global demand * Global supply overhang of 2014-2017 virtually eliminated - OPEC By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, May 15 (Reuters) - Oil prices held firm on Tuesday as ongoing production cuts by OPEC and looming U.S. sanctions against Iran tightened the market amid strong demand. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $78.37 per barrel at 0028 GMT, up 14 cents from their last close and not far off a three-and-a-half year high of $78.53 a barrel reached the previous session. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $71.09 a barrel, up 13 cents and also not far off their Nov. 2014 high of $71.89 a barrel reached last week. Markets have generally tightened as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia, have been withholding supplies since 2017 in order to push up oil prices. With renewed U.S. sanctions looming against OPEC-member Iran and oil demand strong, analysts said crude prices were well supported. “The commitment of Saudi Arabia and the rest of OPEC to the production cuts is a major factor in supporting the price at the moment as well as the possibility of reduced exports from Iran due to sanctions,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Rivkin Securities. The tightening market has all but eliminated a global supply overhang which depressed crude prices between late 2014 and early 2017. OPEC figures published on Monday showed that oil inventories in OECD industrialised nations in March fell to 9 million barrels above the five-year average, down from 340 million barrels above the average in January 2017.

2018-05-15,"NEW YORK, May 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Thirsty Middle Eastern and North African countries could tap into their solar-energy potential to cope with fresh water scarcity, according to resource experts. Water could be saved by switching to renewable solar energy from fossil fuel electricity generation that uses up water, said the World Resources Institute (WRI). The findings show moving to clean energy has benefits aside from cutting planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, said Tianyi Luo, a senior WRI manager. “A lot of times, the water savings, that kind of benefits from renewable projects are overlooked,” Luo told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Libya, Algeria, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan ranked among the top countries, measured by lack of freshwater and solar energy potential, that could benefit from such a switch, the WRI said. “These countries have high-average resources for both solar and wind that could be put to very productive uses, and it could potentially assist them in their water-related challenges,” said Jordan Macknick, energy and water analyst at the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Fresh and sea water is often used in the process of cooling fossil-fuel power plants, ubiquitous in the Middle East and North Africa, according to the World Bank. Put another way, powering one 60-watt incandescent light bulb for 12 hours over one a year can consume 3,000 to 6,000 gallons of water, according to the U.S.-based Virginia Water Resources Research Center. Solar panels, meanwhile, require little or no water to install and maintain. Yemen, an impoverished nation in the grip of civil war, topped the WRI ranking in terms of water scarcity and how much potential electricity solar farms could produce. Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, ranked third. Despite its wealth of oil, the kingdom recently stepped up its involvement in expanding solar energy with an announcement in March of investments to create the world’s biggest solar power project. The project is expected to have the capacity to produce up to 200 gigawatts by 2030.

South Korea imported 1.24 million tonnes of Iranian crude, or 303,025 barrels per day (bpd), in April, down from 1.41 million tonnes from last year, according to the customs data. The world’s fifth-biggest crude oil importer has increased its imports of Iranian crude, mainly condensate, or an ultra-light oil since sanctions were lifted in 2016. However, imports have fallen this year, partly reflecting a cut in supplies to South Korea by the National Iranian Oil Co due to lower production and the start of a new splitter, sources have said. Worries had also been growing about the potential reimposition of U.S. sanctions against Iran, which U.S. President Donald Trump announced on May 8, spurring some South Korean buyers to replace imports of Iranian condensate. South Korean refiner Hyundai Oilbank made its first purchase of Norwegian condensate, while SK Incheon Petrochem said it would continue to buy light crude including from Russia and Kazakhstan. In the first four months of this year, South Korea’s intake of Iranian oil dropped 34 percent to 4.69 million tonnes, or 286,308 bpd, versus about 7.1 million tonnes over the same period a year ago, the data showed. In total, South Korea’s April crude oil imports were 11.59 million tonnes, or 2.83 million bpd, up 2.5 percent from 11.30 million tonnes from 2017, according to the data. April crude imports from Saudi Arabia, South Korea’s top crude oil supplier, fell 6.9 percent to 3.32 million tonnes, or 810,564 bpd, from last year. Meanwhile, South Korea imported 1.01 million tonnes from Russia in April, or 33,689 bpd, up 132.4 percent from 434,974 tonnes last year, according to the data. For the January-April period of this year, South Korean brought in 48.29 million tonnes of crude, or 2.95 million bpd, up 0.2 percent from 48.18 million tonnes in the same period in 2017. Final data for the country’s April crude imports data will be released by state-run Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC) later this month.
