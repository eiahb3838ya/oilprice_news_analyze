2018-05-04,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Illinois’ Attorney General said on Friday she plans to sue the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for allowing a proposed Foxconn Technology Co Ltd plant in neighboring Wisconsin to operate without stringent pollution controls. On Tuesday, the EPA identified 51 areas in 22 states that do not meet federal air quality requirements for ozone, a step toward enforcing the standards issued in 2015. An exempted area was Racine County, Wisconsin, just north of the Illinois border that is known to have heavily polluted air, where Taiwan-based Foxconn is building a $10 billion liquid-crystal display plant. Pollution monitoring data show the county’s ozone levels  exceed the 70 parts per billion (ppb) limit. If Racine County had been designated a “non-attainment” area, it would have required Foxconn to install stringent pollution control equipment. Attorney General Lisa Madigan said she would file a lawsuit in the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals challenging the EPA’s ozone designations, saying its failure to name Racine County a “non-attainment” area puts people at risk. “Despite its name, the Environmental Protection Agency now operates with total disregard for the quality of our air and water, and in this case, the U.S. EPA is putting a company’s profit ahead of our natural resources and the public’s health,” Madigan said in a statement. The EPA, under Administrator Scott Pruitt, left Racine County off its non-attainment list despite an agency staff analysis of ozone levels in Wisconsin published in December, which found that the county’s air exceeded federal ozone limits. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who supports bringing Foxconn to Wisconsin, tweeted on Tuesday that the state would work with EPA “to implement a plan that continues to look out for the best interest of Wisconsin.” Wisconsin’s Republican-controlled state Assembly last year voted to approve a bill that paves the way for a $3 billion incentives package for a proposed by Foxconn.

2018-05-04,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Friday that former Volkswagen Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn, indicted on four felony charges in Detroit in the company’s diesel emissions scandal, is a fugitive who faces a U.S. arrest warrant. As long as Winterkorn remains in Germany, the U.S. warrant is unlikely to have practical impact because Germany does not extradite its citizens to the United States.  Winterkorn, 70, a German citizen, was indicted in March on fraud and conspiracy charges, but the case was only unsealed on Thursday.  David Ashenfelter, a spokesman for the U.S. District Court in Detroit, confirmed a warrant for Winterkorn’s arrest was issued.  Nicole Navas Oxman, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said on Friday, “Martin Winterkorn remains a fugitive.”  A Volkswagen spokeswoman declined to comment, except to reiterate that the company is still cooperating. “We are surprised at the charge,” a lawyer for Winterkorn, Felix Doerr, told German news outlet Handelsblatt. A grand jury in Detroit has indicted nine people in connection with the diesel emissions scandal. Two former VW executives have pleaded guilty and been sentenced prison terms, while a former manager of VW’s Audi unit, Giovanni Pamio, 61, an Italian citizen, has been charged and remains in Germany pending extradition. The remaining six, including Winterkorn, are believed to be in Germany and are unlikely to face U.S. charges. Prosecutors in Germany are also investigating the VW emissions issue. The September 2015 disclosure that VW intentionally cheated on emissions tests for at least six years using secret software led to Winterkorn’s ouster, damaged the company’s reputation around the world and prompted massive bills. In total, VW has agreed to spend more than $25 billion in the United States to address claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers and offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles.

Reuters was first to report this week that Crescent Point was set to win support for its director nominees based on a preliminary counting of votes. The proxy fight, the biggest in the Canadian energy sector in at least about four years, was closely followed by investors and brought to the forefront new activist investor Cation. Crescent Point was Cation’s first activist engagement. Alberta-based Cation, which owns a 0.3 percent stake in Crescent Point, began its public push for change at the company last month. Cation was founded by Sandy Edmonstone, a former deputy head of global oil and gas at Macquarie Capital. The proxy battle was expected to be close, with ISS supporting some of the activist’s nominees and Glass Lewis supporting the company’s choices. Cation called for changes in the board last month, citing the share value that was lost in recent years. Crescent Point’s stock, which was down 1.9 percent on Friday, has shed 67 percent in the last three years.

2018-05-04,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose about 2 percent on Friday, with U.S. crude hitting its highest in more than three years, as global supplies remained tight and the market awaited news from Washington on possible new U.S. sanctions against Iran. Bob Yawger, director at Mizuho, noted the looming May 12 deadline that U.S. President Donald Trump had set for Europeans to “fix” the deal with Iran over its nuclear programme or he would refuse to extend U.S. sanctions relief for the oil-producing Islamic Republic. “You have the May 12 Iran and Trump headlines that support the market,” he said. U.S. light crude settled up $1.29 at $69.72 a barrel. It touched a session peak of $69.97 for the first time since November 2014. It was on track to gain just over 2.3 percent on the week. Brent crude oil settled up $1.25 at $74.87 a barrel.  The global benchmark was set to end the week up 0.3 percent. Iran’s foreign minister said on Thursday that U.S. demands to change its 2015 agreement with world powers were unacceptable. Trump has said European allies must rectify “terrible flaws” in the international accord by May 12. European powers want to hand Trump a plan to save the Iran nuclear deal next week. But they have also started work on protecting EU-Iranian business ties if Trump makes good on his threat to withdraw. Iran resumed its role as a major oil exporter in January 2016 when international sanctions were lifted in return for curbs on Tehran’s nuclear program. ANZ analysts Daniel Hynes and Soni Kumari said Brent could reach $80 a barrel by the end of this year, attributing recent strength to rising geopolitical risks and tighter global supply. “We expect the market to tighten even further in second half 2018,” they wrote in a note to clients. Still, growing U.S. crude supplies have been capping price gains. Surging production in the Permian shale basin is outpacing pipeline capacity, while local refining issues have exacerbated oversupply. The United States now produces more crude oil than top exporter Saudi Arabia, and two weeks of U.S. inventory builds have limited the oil market’s upside. U.S. energy companies added oil rigs for a fifth straight week, with higher crude prices boosting profits and pushing nationwide production to record highs. [RIG/U] Drillers added nine oil rigs in the week to May 4, bringing the total to 834, the highest since March 2015, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to May 1, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.

2018-05-04,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped more than 1 percent on Friday, helped by Apple and other technology shares and by weaker-than-expected jobs data that eased interest rate worries, while U.S. oil prices hit their highest in more than three years.  Apple (AAPL.O) shares rose after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) raised its stake in the iPhone maker. The U.S. Labor Department’s report showed non-farm payrolls increased by 164,000 jobs last month, while the unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent. However, wages edged up only 0.1 percent, easing concerns that inflation pressures were increasing. That assuaged some investor worries about a potential pick-up in the pace of U.S. interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. “The report might have taken some time to digest,” said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. “The focus moved to the lack of wage inflation versus the drop in the unemployment rate. That’s what’s behind the rally today,” he said.  The U.S. central bank on Wednesday left rates unchanged and said it expected annual inflation to run close to its “symmetric” 2 percent target over the medium term.

2018-05-04,"NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - A recent U.S. agency ruling limiting certain tax benefits for energy master limited partnerships (MLPs) dealt a blow to a security class investors had loved for their income but now look likely to steer clear of even though they look cheap. MLPs are tax-exempt corporate structures that pay out profit to investors in dividend-style distributions, many of which are oil and natural gas pipeline companies. The Alerian MLP index plunged 4.6 percent after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said in March they will no longer be allowed to recover an income tax allowance as part of the fees they charge to shippers under a “cost of service” rate structure. A U.S. Appeals Court in 2016 ruled that energy regulators were allowing them to benefit from a “double recovery” of taxes, leading to the FERC ruling. The index is down nearly 8 percent for the year, after a drop of almost 13 percent in 2017, as expectations of higher interest rates, depressed commodity prices and the recent ruling have combined to keep investors wary. “The sentiment around MLPs at this point is just so negative it doesn’t matter what pops up,” said John LaForge, head of Real Asset Strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in Sarasota Florida. “Maybe you would’ve expected even after the FERC decision you would get the initial reaction of the negative and then the value guys step up and say ‘this is crazy,’ but they didn’t do it. You don’t even have the value guys interested at this point.” High dividend yields are a hallmark of MLPs, leading many investors to use them as sources of income. While the dividend yield of the Alerian index was at 8.14 percent at the end of April, it has been on a downward slope since hitting a two-year high of 8.92 percent on March 28. The MLP index reached a record high in September 2014, as oil prices hovered near $100 a barrel and their high dividends made them attractive to investors in a low interest rate environment. Bond yields are rising, undermining the interest rate premium of MLPs and reducing demand, and the U.S. Federal Reserve has shown no signs of deviating from its path of tightening. U.S. benchmark 10-year notes hit a four-year high yield just over 3 percent in April while U.S. two-year yields recently crossed the 2.5 percent mark for the first time in nearly a decade. “For the last decade or so easy monetary policy has led a lot of money to income substitutes and bond proxies,” said Michael Arone, Chief Investment Strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. “As rates have been moving up, particularly on the short end, you are seeing a lot of the kind of weak money leave pretty quickly.” Still, Jeremy Held, director of research at ALPS Portfolio Solutions in Denver, which is the issuer of the Alerian MLP ETF , notes there was a weak correlation between MLPs and interest rates over the 10-year period between 2006 and 2016. When rates rise, “initially they sort of sell off any rate-sensitive asset class – utilities, bonds, MLPs, telecoms,” said Held. “Then when the dust settles people actually look and say it matters if you can grow your (dividend) distribution faster than rates are rising, or is there still a spread.” MLPs have shown some signs of life recently. After selling off on the FERC ruling, the Alerian index was up 3.1 percent through Thursday since March, compared with a 4.3 percent drop in the S&P 500. Oil prices have also continued to climb, with WTI up more than 11 percent and Brent crude up more than 13 percent since the announcement. As MLPs generally track closely or above oil prices, they could be poised to regain their cachet. “If you look at the demand numbers out there, demand is very good,” said Stephen Massocca, Senior Vice President at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. “There is some catching up to do, these things are dirt cheap.” Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Alden Bentley and

2018-05-04,"LONDON/OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s Statoil said it aims to cut its carbon footprint more aggressively as measures to reduce global warming could reduce the value of its assets, leaving some of its reserves stranded underground.  The possibility that large quantities of the world’s oil will never be developed due to the increase of renewable energy and the electrification of transport has been a growing worry for investors in the oil sector. Statoil, Norway’s largest company, started stress testing its portfolio of oil and gas assets against global energy scenarios set out by the International Energy Agency (IEA) at shareholders’ request in 2015. The IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario analyses the likely impact of energy policies by 2040. “The net present value (NPV) (of Statoil’s portfolio) will be reduced by 13 percent ... under the IEA (Sustainable Development) Scenario,” Statoil’s Chief Executive Eldar Saetre told Reuters. However, he said that would still leave Statoil’s portfolio with a “massive” NPV. The IEA says its scenario is aligned with the Paris Agreement goals to keep global warming from exceeding 2 degrees Celsius. Saetre was speaking on the sidelines of a Statoil presentation to investors in London, where the company announced plans to reduce emissions from some of its new fields to 3 kg of CO2 per barrel of oil equivalents (boe), less than a fifth of the global average. Its carbon intensity at its offshore fields stood at 9 kg per boe in 2017, compared to a global average of 17 kg per boe. Statoil said optimization and efficiency improvements have substantially strengthened its portfolio, which includes the giant Johan Sverdrup oilfield off Norway. The field will be powered from shore instead of generating electricity by offshore gas turbines, the main source of emissions on the Norwegian continental shelf.  Statoil reduced its emissions from 11 kg of CO2 per boe in 2014, partly by divesting its carbon-intensive oil sand operations in Canada in 2016. Last year, it said it would no longer explore for heavy oil, which requires more energy and produces more emissions to lift barrels from the ground. However, the company still operates two heavy oilfields in Brazil and Britain, and is working with Rosneft to develop a high-viscous field in Russia. “Despite the negative impact on NPV in the ‘sustainable development scenario’, we see very limited stranding of assets,” Statoil said in its latest sustainability report. Royal Dutch Shell said last month that it saw little risk of having “stranded assets” in its portfolio because four-fifths of the oil major’s current oil and gas reserves would be extracted before 2030 anyway.

2018-05-04,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran’s hardliners are preparing to bring President Hassan Rouhani to heel if U.S. President Donald Trump scraps Tehran’s nuclear deal with major powers, officials and analysts believe. Trump has threatened to abrogate the 2015 agreement by not extending sanctions waivers when they expire on May 12, if Britain, France and Germany do not “fix” its “terrible flaws”. This sets the stage for a resurgence of political infighting within Iran’s complex power structure, Iranian officials said.  Annulment of the accord could tip the balance of power in favour of hardliners looking to constrain the relatively moderate Rouhani’s ability to open up to the West.  While the spotlight is on Trump’s eventual decision there will be a display of unity in Tehran, a senior Iranian official told Reuters, on condition of anonymity. “But when the crisis is over, hardliners will try to weaken and sideline the president,” the official said.  Nor can the president expect any weakening of Iran’s system of clerical rule as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nuclear deal, meaning “Rouhani will be in a no-win situation”, said a relative of Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  For Rouhani the stakes are high. If the deal falls apart, he could become politically vulnerable for promoting the 2015 accord, under which non-nuclear sanctions were lifted in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear programme.  “It will also lead to a backlash against the moderates and pro-reformers who backed Rouhani’s detente policy with the West ... and any hope for moderation at home in the near future will fizzle out,” said political analyst Hamid Farahvashian. It is a delicate balance. Khamenei knows that Iranians, many of whom took to the streets earlier this year to protest against high food prices, can only take so much economic pressure.  But the establishment does not want too much of an opening to the West, despite the likely economic benefits. A weakened Rouhani, unable to push such policies, is likely to serve out  his term, which ends in 2021, another senior official said.  “His removal would be a sign of weakness for the system. It would harm its legitimacy abroad,” the official said. “But he will be blamed and pressured for the economic malaise.” Khamenei gave guarded backing to Rouhani when he opened the door to nuclear diplomacy with world powers in order to end Iran’s economic and political isolation. But the Supreme Leader’s aversion to the United States remains a formidable barrier to any diplomatic solution now, so a Trump withdrawal would make it hard for Rouhani to pursue better relations with the West. “The internal politics will make it difficult, if not impossible, for Rouhani to pursue detente with the West and make concessions in return for economic gains,” said another Iranian government official.  The European signatories of the deal have tried to persuade Trump not abandon it because they want to keep trading with Iran. Despite threats to walk away if Trump buries the deal, several Iranian officials said that “as long as Tehran was not excluded from the global financial and trading system” it could consider respecting the accord.  But many foreign firms are hesitant to invest in Iran, worried by unilateral U.S. sanctions imposed over human rights violations, terrorism, and the dominant role of the  Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Iran’s economy. That is another area where Rouhani is exposed. He has sought without much success to curb the economic activities of the IRGC in order to attract foreign investment. But under the command of Khamenei, the IRGC has ignored the government’s attempts to limit its involvement in the economy. If the nuclear deal collapses, what power Rouhani has to limit that involvement will decline further, boosting hardliners who want to see the president’s powers reined in. The IRGC has done well since the sanctions relating to the nuclear deal were lifted, using front companies with no obvious link to the Guard to serve as a conduit for investors returning to Iran. If sanctions are reimposed as a result of the collapse of the nuclear deal, the Guard is well placed to evade them. “Considering their vast business network and political and military influence, the IRGC will be back to the business of evading sanctions as they did for years in the past,” said a western diplomat in Tehran. The IRGC stepped in when European oil companies abandoned energy projects after the United States and the European Union imposed sanctions in 2012.  “Sepah (the IRGC) is an asset for Iran. They protect Iran whenever needed ... They rescued the economy when the enemies wanted to crush us with sanctions,” said a hardline politician who declined to be identified.        “If European investors yield to America’s pressure and leave Iran, then Sepah will take over,” he said. Concerns over possible Israeli military action against Iran’s nuclear facilities have empowered the IRGC, which runs  security at home and abroad. But experts believe that even under the umbrella of an emboldened IRGC, hardliners might hesitate to apply harsh policies, fearing a revival of the anti-government protests in January that showed the establishment was vulnerable to popular anger fuelled by economic hardship.

2018-05-04,"MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Solar power producer Sonnedix and a consortium led by Italian infrastructure fund F2i are among at least six bidders that have submitted tentative offers for one of Italy’s largest collection of solar assets, sources familiar with the matter said. The sale of Rete Rinnovabile, known as RTR, ranks as Italy’s largest M&A auction so far this year and could be worth up to 1.5 billion euros (1.32 billion pounds), the sources said on Friday. Private equity investor Terra Firma, which has backed the company since 2011, plans to shortlist a group of final bidders in mid May as it wants to wrap up the auction during the summer, the sources said. The bidding field mainly consists of Italian energy players while there has been moderate interest from international funds, they said. A consortium of Italian utility Enel (ENEI.MI) and infrastructure fund F2i has made a non-binding bid for the 334 megawatt portfolio and is vying with Italian energy companies ERG (ERG.MI) and A2A (A2.MI), the sources said. A2A is currently bidding alone but it may later team up with another bidder to make its offer more attractive, they said. Abu Dhabi’s Masdar Clean Tech Fund has decided to partner with Italian investment firm Tages, they said, and the duo made a non-binding bid ahead of a deadline on May 3. Terra Firma, Enel, F2i, ERG, A2A and Tages declined to comment while Masdar was not immediately available to comment. Other international bidders include Canadian investment fund AIMCo and solar power developer Sonnedix, which has 170 power plants in nine countries including Italy and Japan, while interest from Chinese firms has waned, the sources said.  AIMCo and Sonnedix were not immediately available for comment. “There has been a good level of participation,” one of the sources said, adding Terra Firma had reached out to a wide range of bidders signing non-disclosure agreements with 80 to 90 possible suitors. Two of the sources said Japan’s Mitsui (8031.T) had initially expressed an interest in RTR but it was unclear whether it went ahead and bid for the Italian firm. Mitsui was not immediately available for comment. International oil majors including BP (BP.L) have refrained from making an offer while Italy’s ENI - which is keen to grow in the renewable market - was initially in the race and held talks with Qatari investors for a joint bid, the sources said, cautioning there was opposition from ENI’s executives and a bid was unlikely to materialise. On April 18 ENI boss Claudio Descalzi ruled out pursuing acquisitions to help the company’s green energy drive. London-based Terra Firma hired UniCredit, JPMorgan and Jefferies last year to kick off an auction for RTR which owns 134 plants across Italy.  But its price expectations of about 1.5 billion euros may prove challenging for some of the bidders, the sources said, pointing to RTR’s debt of around 900 million euros. The portfolio may fetch a final price of between 1.2 and 1.3 billion euros, they said. RTR, which last year generated 478 gigawatt hours of power, reported core earnings of about 134 million euros in 2017. Subsidies accounted for 86 percent of its sales.

2018-05-04,"* Qatar to hold a direct stake of 19 percent in Rosneft * Boosts Qatar’s ties with the Kremlin amid Gulf boycott * China’s CEFC probe led to the deal collapse By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Olesya Astakhova LONDON/MOSCOW, May 4 (Reuters) - Qatar is taking a stake in Rosneft of nearly 19 percent, rescuing the Russian oil major from its stalled deal to sell a major stake to China’s CEFC. The deal strengthens ties between Moscow and Doha at a time Qatar when is facing boycott by its Gulf Arab neighbours. Qatar’s sovereign investment fund QIA initially bought 19.5 percent in Rosneft together with Swiss trading giant Glencore for 10.2 billion euros ($12.2 billion) during the Russian firm’s partial privatisation in 2016. But last year the consortium agreed to sell a 14.16 stake in Rosneft to CEFC China Energy in a $9.1 billion deal that was seen as key to helping expand relations between Russia and China, the world’s top energy exporter and top energy consumer. That deal ran into trouble after CEFC founder and chairman Ye Jianming was put under investigation by Chinese authorities over suspected economic crimes, Reuters reported in March. Glencore said on Friday that the consortium that had been selling the Rosneft stake had been dissolved, and said Qatar and Glencore would now own stakes directly. QIA would control an equity stake of 18.93 percent and Glencore would hold some 0.57 percent. Rosneft was hit hard by U.S. sanctions on Russia over Moscow’s annexation of Crimea and incursion in east Ukraine. Sources close to the QIA have said Rosneft could prove a profitable long-term investment given the giant firm is worth only $65 billion despite producing more crude than U.S. ExxonMobil, which is worth $324 billion. The fate of the CEFC deal, one of the largest investments by China in Russia, was seen as a litmus test of how far President Xi Jinping’s government was prepared to go with a crackdown on financially risky activities among big-spending conglomerates. Rosneft said it continued to consider China as a strategic market and said it believed that Qatar’s direct ownership would develop into new bilateral, international joint projects. A source close to the deal said Glencore would keep its long-term crude offtake agreement with Rosneft under the new arrangement.

2018-05-04,"BERLIN, May 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has filed criminal charges against former Volkswagen AG (VW) Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn, accusing him of conspiring to cover up the German automaker’s diesel emissions cheating. The indictment reopens the question of whether other senior VW executives knew about the scandal, which has dogged Europe’s biggest automaker for more than 2-1/2 years and led to a regulatory crackdown that is threatening thousands of jobs as customers increasingly shun diesel-powered cars. The indictment of Winterkorn, who resigned days after the scandal became public in September 2015, is likely to be largely symbolic. Resident in Munich, VW’s former CEO is currently in Germany which does not extradite its citizens to non-European Union countries, its Justice Ministry said on Friday. VW had initially suggested only lower-level managers knew of the cheating. But the indictment alleges Winterkorn agreed with other senior VW executives “to continue to perpetrate the fraud and deceive U.S. regulators”. A lawyer for Winterkorn in Germany did not immediately comment. Winterkorn in January 2017 told German lawmakers he had not been informed of the cheating early, and would have halted it had he been aware. Here are the details of who is investigating and who is being investigated as part of the “Dieselgate” scandal in both Germany and the United States: The bulk of “Dieselgate” lawsuits are being handled by prosecutors in Braunschweig where four separate sets of criminal proceedings are being conducted against current and former managers of VW, headquartered in nearby Wolfsburg. Some 39 individuals including Winterkorn are being investigated over suspected emissions fraud, with the former CEO also being probed for suspected market manipulation together with Hans Dieter Poetsch, the group’s former finance chief who is now supervisory board chairman, and Herbert Diess, now group CEO who joined the firm in July 2015 as head of the VW brand. The manipulation refers to allegations that VW delayed disclosing market-sensitive information related to its cheating. Neither Poetsch nor Diess have publicly commented on the investigations, but VW has said it considers the proceedings to be unfounded. Braunschweig prosecutors are also investigating seven people over suspected falsification of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and data deletion. Prosecutors in Munich, state capital of Bavaria where VW’s Audi brand is based, are investigating 18 current and former employees of the premium carmaker over suspected manipulation of diesel engines. A former Audi engine chief who subsequently became a member of the executive board of VW’s sports-car brand Porsche was arrested last year and remains in custody. Audi is suspected of having created the so-called defeat devices years before parent VW used them to cheat emissions tests. Audi denies this. Prosecutors in Stuttgart, home to Porsche, are investigating Matthias Mueller - group CEO between Winterkorn and Diess - as well as Winterkorn and Poetsch over suspected market manipulation. The three sat on the executive board of VW’s majority stakeholder Porsche SE’s when the alleged violation of Germany’s securities trading law took place. Stuttgart prosecutors are also investigating three current or former employees of sports-car maker Porsche. These include development chief Michael Steiner and head of powertrain development Joerg Kerner, sources familiar with the matter have said. Porsche has denied the prosecutors’ accusations against all suspects. Steiner and Kerner couldn’t be reached for comment. In total, nine people have been charged and two former VW executives have pleaded guilty and been sentenced to prison terms. One Italian citizen, former Audi manager Giovanni Pamio, is in Germany awaiting extradition. Pamio’s lawyers have said he is cooperating with prosecutors and has denied the allegations. Six former senior VW managers charged, including Winterkorn and ex-VW brand development chief Heinz-Jakob Neusser, are believed to be in Germany and have avoided facing U.S. prosecutors. Neusser’s lawyer has declined to comment on the charges.

2018-05-04,"* Eyes on U.S. China trade talks * U.S. dollar higher despite jobs data * Oil prices rise (Updates with early U.S. markets’ activity, changes dateline, previous LONDON) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - World stock indexes climbed and U.S. Treasury yields were near unchanged on Friday after data showed weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs and wage growth in April, bolstering investor views that the pace of U.S. rate hikes will be gradual. Gains in shares of Apple helped U.S. stocks after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway raised its stake in the iPhone maker. The Labor Department’s closely watched report showed non-farm payrolls increased by 164,000 jobs last month, while the unemployment rate was at 3.9 percent. However, wages edged up only 0.1 percent, easing concerns that inflation pressures were increasing. “If people were worried about a faster pace of hike, this report should calm those... The curve will likely resume its flattening bias in the long term, but it won’t invert in the foreseeable future,” said Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at Schwab Center for Financial Research in New York. The U.S. central bank on Wednesday left interest rates unchanged and said it expected annual inflation to run close to its “symmetric” 2 percent target over the medium term. Yields on U.S. benchmark 10-year notes and 30-year yields earlier slid to two-week lows, while those on two-year notes fell to a one-week trough. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 5/32 in price to yield 2.9628 percent, from 2.946 percent late on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 255.5 points, or 1.07 percent, to 24,185.65, the S&P 500 gained 25.36 points, or 0.96 percent, to 2,655.09 and the Nasdaq Composite added 98.48 points, or 1.39 percent, to 7,186.63. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.62 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.57 percent. The U.S. dollar rose to its highest levels this year against a basket of currencies despite the weaker-than-expected jobs data. The dollar index jumped to 92.90, the highest level since Dec. 28. The dollar index rose 0.35 percent, with the euro down 0.46 percent to $1.1932. The dollar has gained as investors bet that the Fed will continue raising rates while other central banks, including the European Central Bank, will act more slowly. While the Fed is seen raising interest rates at least two more times this year, expectations of policy tightening from the ECB and the Bank of England are receding. That has driven the difference between German and U.S. government bond yields to near the highest in nearly three decades, with the short-dated and long-dated “transatlantic spread” standing at 305 and 240 basis points respectively. Investors are also focused on trade tensions between the United States and China. Top officials from Beijing and Washington have reached a consensus on some aspects of the countries’ trade dispute, but disagreements over other issues remain “relatively big,” according to China’s Xinhua news agency. Talks over the past two days have involved a high-level U.S. trade delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and top Chinese officials, following months of threats and counter threats from both sides in a series of disputes over trade practices. In the oil market, U.S. crude rose 1.4 percent to $69.39 per barrel and Brent was last at $74.58, up 1.3 percent on the day. Additional reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss in New York

2018-05-04,"LISBON, May 4 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Providing clean energy to Somalis, including those uprooted from their homes in the conflict-torn country, could both improve lives there and provide new opportunities for entrepreneurs, the U.N. envoy to Somalia said. Despite persistent violence, Somalia is “slowly sorting its problems out”, with efforts underway to rebuild the state, raise more tax revenue and improve security, said Michael Keating, the highest United Nations official in the Horn of Africa nation. “That image of Somalia that is dominated by bombs and hunger is really out of date,” Keating said on the sidelines of a conference on energy access in Lisbon this week. “The issue is: How can energy contribute to moving the country forward?” As the population grows, climate change and environmental degradation are contributing to the “many problems” faced by Somalis, who are competing for natural resources such as land, wood and water, Keating said. That, in turn, is fuelling tensions. “People are drifting into cities where they can’t sustain themselves,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview. Some 2.2 million people have been displaced from their homes inside Somalia, and another 870,000 are registered as refugees in other countries, according to U.N. figures. Some have fled fighting, while others have been forced to abandon their farms due to drought. But the legacy of 25 years of civil war is not all bad, Keating noted. Left with little functioning electricity infrastructure, Somalia has the chance to leapfrog to a more nimble approach, using local grids powered by renewable energy. The need is pressing, with a report on progress towards global energy goals this week showing only 30 percent of Somalis had access to electricity in 2016, up from 20 percent in 2010. Just 2 percent are able to use clean fuels for cooking, with the rest resorting to dirtier forms of energy such as kerosene and charcoal, which are damaging to health. Keating has been talking to the government about whether Somalia can “make itself into a clean energy country”, drawing on solar, wind and hydropower from its two big rivers, he said. In 2014, 60 to 70 local energy providers banded together to form a power generation, transmission and distribution company called BECO, which is slowly shifting to solar energy, he noted. BECO supplies 50 megawatts (MW) of power, operating in the capital Mogadishu and other cities including Afgooye and Kismayo. The company aims to boost its solar power generation capacity by 5.5 MW annually, eventually reducing the share of power produced from fossil fuels, mainly diesel, to less than 40 percent, according to the United Nations. Other smaller enterprises, such as Power OffGrid in Jowhar, are providing solar home systems, mini-grids and solar equipment to run irrigation pumps for farmers and cold storage for clinics and local businesses. “Ironically, Somalia is a great place to try and get things going,” said Keating. “However, people are concerned about security and at a certain point, you do need more government regulation.” Few market restrictions are imposed on businesses, but that can lead to overlapping provision in some places and inconsistent standards, he noted. U.N. agencies and other development organisations can support Somalia’s push for clean energy and universal access by bringing together government, business and communities to chart a way forward, and providing information about what has worked in similar environments, Keating said. The international community can also mobilise finance - but attracting investment from the Somali diaspora around the world is key, he added. For Somalia’s large displaced population, many crammed into informal settlements in the capital, gaining access to clean energy is a question of “dignity” as well as safety, he said. ""It's about giving people who live in very tough circumstances the opportunity to contribute to their own welfare, and make a living at the same time,"" he explained.

2018-05-04,"WASHINGTON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The United States has filed criminal charges against former Volkswagen AG boss Martin Winterkorn, accusing him of conspiring to cover up the German automaker’s diesel emissions cheating, in a rare attempt to prosecute a CEO for company actions.  The indictment reopens the question of whether other senior Volkswagen (VW) executives knew about the scandal, which has dogged Europe’s biggest automaker for more than 2-1/2 years and led to a regulatory crackdown that is threatening thousands of jobs as customers increasingly shun diesel-powered cars. The indictment, filed by the Department of Justice (DoJ) in secret in March, was unsealed in a U.S. district court on Thursday as VW (VOWG_p.DE) held its annual meeting in Berlin. Winterkorn, 70, is charged with four felony counts, including conspiracy to defraud the United States, wire fraud and violating the Clean Air Act from at least May 2006 through November 2015, after VW admitted using illicit software that allowed diesel cars to emit excess pollution without detection.  Winterkorn resigned within days of the scandal becoming public in September 2015, but other senior executives who were on the company’s management board at the time continue to hold senior positions within the group.  Hans-Dieter Poetsch, who was finance chief, is now chairman of the supervisory board. Herbert Diess, now group CEO, joined the company on July 1 2015 as head of the VW brand, only weeks before authorities divulged its cheating on Sept. 18, 2015.  Rupert Stadler, who was head of the Audi brand in 2015, has been given additional responsibilities for group sales in a revamp announced by Diess last month. Bernd Osterloh, the company’s powerful labour chief who also sits on the VW supervisory board, is still in place.   VW has said the decision to install illegal “defeat device” software was taken in 2006 below the management board level. “None of the members of the board of management had, at that time and for many years to follow, knowledge of the development and implementation of this software function,” VW said in its 2017 annual report. A lawyer for Winterkorn in Germany did not immediately comment. Winterkorn in January 2017 told German lawmakers he had not been informed of the cheating early, and would have halted it had he been aware. A VW spokesman in Germany said the company “continues to cooperate with investigations” but does not comment about probes of individuals.” Winterkorn is unlikely to face U.S. authorities. Germany’s Federal Justice Ministry said on Friday it does not extradite German nationals to countries outside the European Union. Winterkorn is currently in Germany is unlikely to travel to a jurisdiction that might extradite him to the United States, a source familiar with his thinking said. VW shares, which were trading ex-dividend on Friday, were 0.3 percent higher at 172.62 euros at 1204 GMT. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) chief Scott Pruitt and other senior Trump administration official issued statements criticizing VW with the indictment. “If you try to deceive the United States, then you will pay a heavy price,” Sessions said. In contrast with VW, no individuals were charged at Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) in connection with its sudden unintended acceleration scandal or at General Motors Co (GM.N) for the cover-up of a deadly ignition switch defect. The federal government’s decisions not to prosecute senior banking industry executives over the 2007-2009 financial crisis has also drawn fire from advocates of tougher measures to deter corporate wrongdoing. VW has been fighting to move on from the scandal. It settled criminal charges with the U.S. DoJ in 2017 by agreeing to a $4.3 billion (3.2 billion pound) payment, and has pledged to spend billions on new electric vehicles. In total, it has agreed to spend more than $25 billion in the United States to address claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers. But prosecutors in Germany and the United States are continuing investigations into what senior executives at VW and its Porsche and Audi brands knew. They have also opened investigations into BMW (BMWG.DE), Mercedes-Benz (DAIGn.DE) and FiatChrysler (FCHA.MI) related to their diesel emissions. VW has also offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. Many are now stored in parking lots around the United States.     VW has never commented on when individual management board members learned about the defeat devices.  The filing with the U.S. district court said Winterkorn was briefed about the consequences of being caught using an illegal emissions device on July 27, 2015.  VW disclosed to U.S. authorities that it had used illegal software in its cars on Sept. 3, 2015, and did not inform investors until the U.S. EPA alerted the public on Sept. 18.  VW chose not to disclose the issue earlier because it felt the matter could be resolved amicably with U.S. authorities, its annual report said.       Sessions said in a statement that the charges against Winterkorn showed “Volkswagen’s scheme to cheat its legal requirements went all the way to the top of the company.” The indictment describes how VW employees presented PowerPoint slides to Winterkorn and “other senior VW AG management at an in-person meeting at VW’s headquarters in Wolfsburg.” The meeting provided a “clear picture” of how the company was deceiving U.S. regulators about software used to rig emissions tests of VW diesel vehicles, it said. The indictment also alleges that VW employees recommended the company seek to get approval for 2016 diesel models from U.S. regulators without revealing the existence of the cheating software. Winterkorn agreed to the plan, the indictment said. The indictment also states Winterkorn was informed of the emissions cheating by a memo sent in May 2014. Winterkorn has said he did not learn of the cheating until late August 2015. At its annual meeting, VW’s new CEO Herbert Diess vowed to make the carmaker “more honest”, but investors called for outside vetting of steps to restore its reputation. VW had initially suggested only lower-level executives knew of the cheating. But the indictment alleges Winterkorn agreed with other senior VW executives “to continue to perpetrate the fraud and deceive U.S. regulators.”  In total, nine people have been charged and two former VW executives have pleaded guilty in the case and been sentenced to prison terms. One Italian citizen, former Audi manager Giovanni Pamio, is in Germany awaiting extradition. Six former VW executives charged, including Winterkorn, are believed to be in Germany and have avoided facing U.S. prosecutors.

2018-05-04,"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) said on Friday it named Andrew Bonfield of Britain’s National Grid (NG.L) as its chief financial officer, replacing Brad Halverson, who has been with the company for more than three decades. Bonfield’s appointment comes at a time when Caterpillar is fighting an IRS demand that it pay $2 billion in taxes and penalties for shifting profit to its Swiss unit to lessen its U.S. tax bill. Bonfield, 54, has been National Grid’s CFO for more than eight years, during which he oversaw the company’s $7 billion stake sale in its gas grid in 2016, which was then reported as one of the biggest British infrastructure deals in recent times. He has held senior finance roles across a range of companies, including confectioner Cadbury Plc, which is now owned by Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), and drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N). In March, Bonfield was named to the board of Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L). Caterpillar said it would offer an annual base salary of $800,000 when Bonfield takes the job on Sept. 1. Halverson, who retires on Friday, served as CFO since 2013. Joe Creed will be the interim finance chief until Bonfield take over, Caterpillar said.

2018-05-04,"LONDON/OSLO (Reuters) - Statoil is working with its partner SSE (SSE.L) to develop the Dogger Bank offshore wind project so it can take part in Britain’s renewable energy subsidy auction in 2019, the company said on Friday. The planned 4.8 gigawatt (GW) Dogger Bank project, which has approval from the British authorities, is set to become the world’s largest offshore wind park and could deliver more than five percent of Britain’s electricity needs, Statoil Executive Vice President Irene Rummelhoff said in London. Britain has replaced direct subsidies with a contracts-for-difference (CfD) system. Qualifying projects are guaranteed a minimum price at which they can sell electricity and renewable power generators bid for CfD contracts in a round of auctions. “We are working this together with our partner SSE really hard, and aiming to bring this forward for the next CfD auction in the UK in 2019,” Rummelhoff told a conference. Statoil has a 50 percent stake in the partnership developing 3.6 GW of the approved capacity at Dogger Bank. “The strategic importance of that project to the UK and Statoil can not be overestimated,” Rummelhoff said. The Norwegian oil and gas firm says it plans to spend up to 15-20 percent of capital spending on “new energy solutions” by 2030, as part of its effort to become a “broad energy” company. Last year, Statoil built the world’s first floating offshore wind park off Scotland, using in-house technology. Its plans also include developing a 1.5 GW offshore wind park in the United States outside New York. “We see growing potential for floating (wind projects),” Rummelhoff said. “We expect about 13 GW floating offshore wind to be installed by 2030. On a global basis, we hope to take a fair share of that.” Floating turbines could help to harness wind energy beyond the shallow waters where turbines stand on fixed foundations.  Statoil also entered the first project to build a 162 megawatt solar power plant in Argentina last year. “We are carefully testing solar,” Rummelhoff said. “We see a lot of opportunities to use our engineers, but we have not decided to go all in solar yet.” Reporting by Ron Bousso in London and Nerijus Adomaitis in Oslo; Editing by Terje Solsvik and Edmund Blair",https://uk.reuters.com/article/statoil-renewables/update-1-statoil-eyes-britains-2019-renewable-subsidy-auction-for-dogger-bank-idUKL8N1SB3RX,04 May 2018,"Statoil is working with its

2018-05-04,"(Adds detail, comments from president) LILONGWE, May 4 (Reuters) - Malawi’s economy will grow by as much as 6 percent in 2019 from a 4 percent expansion expected in 2018, President Peter Mutharika said on Friday, in remarks ahead of the presentation of the national budget in parliament. Malawi, which is heavily reliant on financing from foreign donors, mostly Britain, other European Union countries and the United States, has restored economic stability after a period when the siphoning off of funds by government officials led to donors freezing budgetary support in 2013. A former justice minister and scores of other government officials were convicted of complicity in the “Cashgate” scandal. “It has taken us three years to turn around the economy from the devastation of Cashgate, and through national disasters of floods, drought and hunger,” Mutharika said. Landlocked Malawi is a net importer of fuel and other essential commodities, mainly agricultural inputs and drugs. “This month, four years ago - we were speaking of a broken economy, stagnated projects and smashed hopes. Today, we have the economy fixed, confidence regained, projects moving, and hopes rising,” said Mutharika. Malawi, which is experiencing power rationing due to inadequate generation, aims to more than double power supply from the current 360 Megawatts (MW) to 1,000 MW by 2023, by diversifying from hydro electricity generation to coal, wind, solar and gas, Mutharika said. Mutharika said Malawi planned to build an international airport along Lake Malawi, as part of ambitious plans to turn the country’s tourism industry into a major source of revenue. The lake, which has also been subject of oil exploration in recent years, covers more than half of the country and is a major tourist attraction. Elections are due in Malawi in May 2019 and Mutharika has declared that he will seek a second term, despite recent criticism of his age. He will be 79 next year.

2018-05-04,"* Stocks set for biggest weekly loss since mid-March * Dollar climbs ahead of payrolls data * Eyes on U.S. China trade talks * Transatlantic spread widens to three-decade high * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, May 4 (Reuters) - World stocks were set for their biggest weekly loss since mid-March on Friday, while the dollar hovered just below recent four-month highs as investors awaited crucial U.S. jobs data that could cement expectations of further U.S. interest rate rises this year. MSCI’s All-Country World Index, a gauge of stocks across 47 countries, was up less than 0.1 percent on the day. It was set for a 1.2 percent loss this week, its biggest since the week ended March 23. Investors were cautious after a largely weak performance on Wall Street overnight, as disappointments on the earnings front hit stocks in companies such as Spotify and AIG . Bond yields meanwhile slid following a surprising slowdown in euro zone inflation. The other issue preying on markets is the trade tension between the United States and China. Top officials from Beijing and Washington have reached a consensus on some aspects of the countries’ trade row, but disagreements over other issues remain “relatively big”, according to China’s Xinhua news agency. The talks over the past two days have involved a high-level U.S. trade delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and top Chinese officials, following months of threats and counter threats from both sides in a series of disputes over trade practices. “Concerns about the ongoing meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials over trade policy have been cited as one factor contributing to some of yesterday’s investor nervousness, however these worries aren’t likely to dissipate any time soon,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. Meanwhile, the dollar rose against a basket of currencies , hugging recent highs posted on the back of a sharp rally that has fully reversed its 2018 losses. It could get more fuel should April U.S. payrolls data, due at 1230 GMT, underscore labour market strength. Non-farm payrolls were likely to have increased by about 192,000 last month, according to a Reuters survey of economists, after rising only 103,000 in March. But it will be the wages figure that analysts will focus on. “A further pick-up in the pace of wage gains could be the ‘smoking gun’ for the Fed (Federal Reserve) to express any shift away from ‘roughly balanced’ risks to inflation,” said Mizuho analyst Vishnu Varathan. While the U.S. Federal Reserve is seen raising interest rates at least two more times this year, expectations of policy tightening from the European Central Bank and the Bank of England are receding. That has driven the difference between German and U.S. government bond yields to near the highest in nearly three decades, with the short-dated and long-dated “transatlantic spread” standing at 305 and 240 basis points respectively. Currency markets are betting the relative interest rate advantage will continue to push the dollar higher. However, analysts at ING reckon the dollar’s recent reversal is likely to be short-lived. “When dissecting the anatomy of this dollar correction, we feel it exhibits all the hallmarks of a short squeeze. Positioning had clearly been stretched,” they wrote in a research note. While short dollar bets have receded somewhat, they are still holding near a record $28 billion registered in late April. The euro meanwhile stood just above four-month lows against the dollar, a level hit after inflation in the euro zone fell short of expectations, according to data on Thursday. The euro weakness has lifted European stocks however, with a euro zone index set for its sixth straight week of gains . A pan-European equity benchmark meanwhile was up 0.3 percent thanks to a flurry of robust earnings reports from companies such as chemicals firm Lanxess, British Airways owner IAG and sports car maker Ferrari. However, banking stocks lagged following poor updates, including from HSBC and Societe Generale. Oil prices steadied as global supplies remained tight and the market awaited news from Washington on possible new U.S. sanctions against Iran.

2018-05-04,"(Repeats May 3 story with no changes) * “Political agreement” could be ready for Trump next week * Unclear why Russia, China should back tough approach * EU could try 1990s-era blocking sanctions to shield companies By John Irish and Robin Emmott PARIS/BRUSSELS, May 3 (Reuters) - European powers still want to hand Donald Trump next week a plan to save the Iran nuclear deal, but they have also started work on protecting EU-Iranian business ties if the U.S. president makes good on a threat to withdraw, six sources told Reuters. Trump, who says the 2015 accord is a “disaster”, has all but decided to withdraw by May 12, U.S. officials say, and looks set to reject four months of European efforts to address his concerns. But France, Britain and Germany aim to present to the White House a separate political agreement that commits to taking a tougher stance on Iran if they can agree it in time with the U.S. State Department, their American interlocutors. Several of the sources said they were sceptical the effort would succeed, and all said the Europeans were also working on damage limitation scenarios if it fails. “We have a week to continue talking to the Americans to see if we can find an agreement on the deal,” said a senior European diplomat. “But I don’t think there is any reason to be overly optimistic.” The political agreement, which is a culmination of transatlantic diplomacy, does not include Iran or Russia and China, the other parties to the accord. It seeks to spell out to Trump that Europe will seek to contain Tehran’s ballistic missile programme, its influence in Syria and Yemen, the terms by which inspectors visit suspect Iranian sites, and “sunset” clauses under which some of its terms expire. While the Europeans and the Americans have narrowed their differences, they are struggling to agree on how to handle a U.S. desire to extend some of the limits on Iran’s nuclear programme, without reopening the July 2015 accord. “We’re trying to find the right formulas that respond to the expectations of the Americans, but at the same time do not go against the deal,” said a second senior European diplomat. “There is a chance of getting an agreement, but even if we have we one, I’m not convinced that it will be enough to stop the U.S. withdrawing,” the diplomat said. In their package for Trump, the Europeans are also grappling with a U.S. desire to make explicit that Iran must give international inspectors access to military sites. The Europeans say this is already implicit in the original deal. “There’s a U.S. view that the inspection provisions aren’t strong enough, which is not a view that is shared by the Europeans,” said a third diplomat involved in the discussions. France’s President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are continuing to lobby Trump, but with the prospect of him changing his mind remote, the focus has shifted to managing the fallout and avoiding a dangerous vacuum. Macron in Washington last week proposed that, irrespective of Trump’s decision, there should be a wider discussion between Iran and the powers behind the original deal, which took 12 years to negotiate, working towards a grand bargain. That would incorporate the existing nuclear deal and the issues currently discussed between Europeans and Americans. But it is hard to see how Iran could be brought back to the table. Tehran says it is abiding by the terms of the 2015 deal and has no intention to renegotiate it. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Thursday rejected any form of renegotiation. France, Britain and Germany all say they will stay in the deal even if the United States withdraws, and try to protect and foster trade with Iran that has soared since the European Union lifted most of its economic sanctions on Iran. Iran’s exports of mainly fuel and other energy products to the EU in 2016 jumped 344 percent to 5.5 billion euros ($6.58 billion) compared to the previous year, while investment in Iran jumped to more than 20 billion euros. If Trump can’t be persuaded not to withdraw, “the second-best solution is to encourage the Americans to ... keep conditions that enable our companies in non-oil related sectors to continue to trade,” said a French official. The German Economy Ministry said it was waiting for a formal U.S. decision on the Iran deal before deciding whether to stop offering German firms export guarantees for business deals with Tehran. Such guarantees provide state protection for companies doing business abroad when foreign debtors fail to pay. The prospect of trade with Europe would provide the Europeans with a chance to assuage the Iranians, and dissuade them from rash decisions such as leaving the deal or reviving the nuclear activities they agreed to give up. Countermeasures could include a special EU blocking statute developed in the 1990s but never fully used, to shield European firms doing business with Iran from U.S. legal action if Washington reimposes sanctions. But EU plans to keep money flowing to Iran would require the United States to approve non-dollar-denominated export credit facilities and other funding support to help firms enter Iran without fear of American legal ramifications. Two European officials said reviving the blocking statutes would still be mostly a symbolic step to show the Iranians that Europe was committed to the deal. In practice, companies would fear that investing in Iran would harm their commercial interests with the United States. A senior Iranian official agreed. “These are good ideas to show the Europeans are committed to the agreement, but we think that if they have to choose between Iran and the United States, they will choose the America,” said the senior Iranian official.

2018-05-04,"COLOMBO, May 4 (Reuters) - Sri Lanka will sign agreements with French oil and gas major Total and a subsidiary of U.S. firm Schlumberger for a seismic study off its east coast to evaluate any prospective oil resources, a top official said on Friday. Vajira Dassanayake, the director general at Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat (PRDS), said a first deal signed with Total in 2016 to conduct a study off the eastern coast did not take place due to “some issues”. “We are hoping to sign a new agreement with Total later this month,” Dassanayake told Reuters. Total had earlier signed a two-year agreement with PRDS to survey around 50,000 sq km off the east coast from the air, at a cost of $25 million to acquire data on unexplored areas. Dassanayake said Total will invest $3 million to $10 million for the seismic study, while Eastern Echo Holding Ltd, a subsidiary of Schlumberger, will carry it out. “It’s a marine survey. There will be more resources allocated this time compared to the previous agreement. They will have the marketing exclusivity for a certain period until they recover their cost,” Dassanayake said. “Actual ownership of the data will be with the government of Sri Lanka. They (Total) have one year to negotiate with us and to give us a favourable contract for production and sharing.” Officials from Total and Schlumberger did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Sri Lanka produces no oil and is dependent on imports for all of its fuel requirements, despite trying to reinvigorate oil and gas exploration after the end nine years ago of its 25-year civil war with Tamil separatists.

2018-05-04,"COPENHAGEN/MADRID (Reuters) - Shares in rival wind turbine makers Siemens Gamesa (SGREN.MC) and Vestas (VWS.CO) fell on Friday as a squeeze on prices caused by reduced state subsidies took its toll on quarterly profits. The wind power industry is undergoing a period of painful readjustment as governments from Europe to Latin America rein in subsidies and turn to competitive tenders, putting pressure on prices throughout the supply chain. “It’s challenging across the board, it’s very competitive,” Vestas’ Chief Financial Officer Marika Fredriksson told Reuters. Vestas’ operating profit for the January-March period of 126 million euros (111.2 million pounds) was a decline of 40 percent and also lagged analysts’ forecast of 137 million euros. Majority owned by Germany’s Siemens (SIEGn.DE) following a merger of its wind power business with Spain’s Gamesa last year, Siemens Gamesa said adjusted operating earnings for the same period fell 40 percent to 189 million euros. Shares in Denmark’s Vestas fell 4.4 percent by 0925 GMT while Siemens Gamesa traded down 3.4 percent. Vestas’ average selling price per megawatt came in at around 740,000 per megawatt, which was flat from the previous quarter.  However, both companies cautioned it was still too early to say if prices had stabilised after a double-digit decline seen last year. “It could appear so, but we still want to have more sustainable and long-term view on the stabilisation of the market,” Vestas’ Fredriksson said. That caution was echoed by Siemens Gamesa. “It’s the second quarter of stable average selling price of the order intake ... (but) we’re not able to determine if this is already a trend,” Siemens Gamesa CFO Miguel Angel Lopez, told a conference call. Most recent rankings by consultancy firms GlobalData and MAKE show Siemens Gamesa claiming the top spot in terms of sold turbine capacity last year, overtaking Vestas in a race to cater the competitive wind power sector. Vestas is still a market leader in terms of total installed capacity, said Vestas citing MAKE. Siemens Gamesa, which counts Spanish energy group Iberdrola (IBE.MC) among its key shareholders, kept its target for an EBIT margin of 7-8 percent this year. Vestas still targets an EBIT margin of 9-11 percent this year. Siemens Gamesa in February unveiled 2 billion euros in cost cuts by 2020 to close a margin gap to Vestas, both facing margin pressure as government cuts support for renewables to force them into competition with conventional energy sources. Siemens Gamesa more than doubled its quarterly order intake to 2.5 GW, while Vestas order intake came in at 1.6 GW.

2018-05-04,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish oil major Repsol (REP.MC) posted an 8 percent year-on-year increase in adjusted first-quarter net profit on Friday, as higher Brent oil prices and increased production offset lower refining margins.    Repsol said higher prices for oil and gas, including a 24 percent rise in Brent over the year, helped push recurring net profit adjusted for one-off gains and inventory effects (CCS net profit) to 616 million euros ($737.6 million) in January-March. This compared with 570 million euros in the same period of the previous year, and was in line with median forecast of 615 million euros drawn from six analysts polled by Reuters. Production rose to 727 barrels per day from 693 a year ago, but the refining margin fell to $6.6 a barrel versus $7.1 a barrel in the first quarter of last year.  Europe’s fifth-largest refiner by market value has focused on cost and debt reduction to improve its balance sheet in recent years, leading to credit rating upgrades. Repsol said on Friday its first-quarter results were  supported by a decrease in financial costs. Net debt rose 569 million euros from the fourth quarter, to 6.8 billion euros, mainly due to a share buyback undertaken to allow the payment of a scrip dividend.          Credit risk in Venezuela, where political turmoil has led to economic collapse and hyperinflation, prompted a writedown of 433 million euros.  Repsol shares were at 15.96 euros by 0845 GMT, up 0.4 from Thursday’s close.

2018-05-04,"LONDON (Reuters) - Vivo Energy PLC launched on the London Stock Exchange on Friday with a valuation of nearly 2 billion pounds  ($2.7 billion), the largest London IPO so far this year and the largest Africa-focused IPO in more than a decade.  The initial offer price for the just under 30 percent of the company floated was set at 165 pence per share and the shares advanced to 169.50 pence in conditional trading.  The company is the downstream fuels joint venture of energy trading house Vitol and Helios Investment Partners which are cutting their stakes. It sells Shell-branded fuels and lubricants at nearly 2,000 filling stations in 15 African countries. “It’s a success,” said Vivo Chief Executive Christian Chammas. “The offer was seriously oversubscribed.” “Our success comes from the success of Africa,” he said, noting that the average growth rate in the countries where the company operates is roughly 4 percent per year. “It’s a different environment,” he  added. The IPO is the largest Africa-focused London listing since Telecom Egypt raised 514 million pounds on a 2.662 billion pound valuation in December 2005 and the most significant since Seplat raised $500 million in a 2014 IPO with a market capitalization of $1.9 billion. [reut.rs/2HUmgGb] Chammas said the listing would allow the company to join the benchmark FTSE 250 index. It follows an aborted IPO plan from Vitol’s European downstream venture, Varo Energy, which pulled its Amsterdam flotation last month. Varo said global trade disputes had negatively affected other European initial public offerings. The offer of 332.2 million shares equates to 548 million pounds representing 27.7 per cent of the company. It creates liquidity for the primary shareholders, and will bring Vitol’s ownership down to 40 percent, from 55 percent, and that of Helios to 30 percent, from 44 percent, Chammas said.  JPMorgan, Citigroup and Credit Suisse led the listing.       Vivo reported adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of $376 million in 2017, up from $302 million in 2016. It also expects to close by the end of the year a deal to buy 300 filling stations from South Africa’s Engen, which will expand its business to nine additional African countries.

2018-05-04,"(Corrects paragraph 2 to make clear Monday’s Brent close was the highest for 3-1/2 years, not 2-1/2.) * Eyes on Trump move on Iran sanctions that could hit oil supply * European powers work to save Iran nuclear accord By Christopher Johnson LONDON, May 4 (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Friday, consolidating after recent gains, as global supplies stayed tight and the market awaited news from Washington over possible new U.S. sanctions against Iran. Brent crude oil was down 10 cents at $73.52 a barrel by 0800 GMT. The benchmark contract hit a 3-1/2 year closing high of $75.17 on Monday. U.S. light crude was 5 cents lower at $68.38 and set for gain of 0.3 percent for the week. “Rising geopolitical risks have been a big factor behind oil’s strong rise this year,” ANZ analysts Daniel Hynes and Soni Kumari wrote in a note to clients of the bank. “The extent of the rally would have been significantly weaker if not for the recent tightness in the market. We expect the market to tighten even further in H2 2018.” ANZ has a 12-month target for Brent of $80 a barrel. Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said the market may retest a price support level at $72.39 per barrel after peaking around resistance at $75.45. Oil traders are concerned that sanctions against Iran may cut oil supplies. Iran’s foreign minister said on Thursday U.S. demands to change its 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers were unacceptable, as a deadline set by President Donald Trump for Europeans to “fix” the deal loomed. Trump has said that unless European allies rectify the “terrible flaws” in the international accord by May 12, he will refuse to extend U.S. sanctions relief for the oil-producing Islamic Republic. “Prices reflect a premium for Iran uncertainties. Investors are worried about supplies after Iran took a tough stance in its response to the United States,” said Wang Xiao, head of crude research with Guotai Junan Futures. European powers still want to hand Trump a plan to save the Iran nuclear deal next week. But they have also started work on protecting E.U.-Iranian business ties if the U.S. president makes good on a threat to withdraw. Iran resumed its role as a major oil exporter in January 2016 when international sanctions against Tehran were lifted in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear program. Aside from security concerns, growing U.S. crude supplies are capping price gains. Surging production in the Permian shale basin is outpacing pipeline capacity, while local refining issues have exacerbated oversupply in the region. The United States now produces more crude oil than top exporter Saudi Arabia.

2018-05-04,"(Adds spreadbetters, updates with fresh levels throughout) * Asian shares down as markets wait for U.S. payrolls * Eurozone inflation, U.S. data fail to boost dollar * Indonesian stocks fall heavily, Argentine peso at record low By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, May 4 (Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Friday while the dollar ran into some profit-taking after several weeks of strong gains as financial markets turned their attention to looming U.S. payrolls data for fresh catalysts. Spreadbetters pointed to a firm start for European shares although Wall Street was poised for another wobbly day. E-Minis for S&P 500 were off 0.2 percent while London’s FTSE futures climbed 0.4 percent. Regional trading was relatively quieter as Japan was on holiday. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.5 percent, and looked set for a third straight weekly loss. Indonesian stocks led the declines, falling as much as 1.5 percent in early trading before recouping some of those losses. South Korean shares were down 1 percent and Australian shares eased 0.6 percent. The focus for markets will be on the U.S. jobs data due later in the global day, with the April report likely to underscore labour market strength. Nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 192,000 jobs last month, according to a Reuters survey of economists, after rising only 103,000 in March. But it will be the wages figure that analysts will closely watch. “A further pick-up in the pace of wage gains could be the ‘smoking gun’ for the Fed to express any shift away from ‘roughly balanced’ risks to inflation,” said Mizuho analyst Vishnu Varathan in a note. “For now, we expect that reactions may still be subdued given that the runway of evidence remains short; and so the bearish UST and bullish USD trades may not be taking off aggressively just yet.” Investors were also keeping a close watch on U.S.-China trade talks, though analysts said they had little confidence that the U.S. delegation in Beijing, led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, will achieve any breakthrough on the tariff standoff between the world’s two biggest economies. Chinese shares stumbled, with the blue-chip index off 0.4 percent and Shanghai’s SSE Composite down 0.3 percent. Investors were cautious after a largely weak performance on Wall Street on Thursday as some disappointing earnings reports offset strong economic data, while bond yields slid after a surprising slowdown in eurozone inflation. The U.S. dollar weakened from a recent four-month peak against major currencies during a choppy session, a day after the Federal Reserve ended a policy meeting with no change in rates and a less hawkish statement than investors had anticipated. Disappointing U.S. company earnings, upbeat data on factory orders and the U.S. trade balance as well as the underwhelming eurozone inflation data made for a challenging trading environment. “The price action since the FOMC statement indicates a real division of opinion in markets over the U.S. dollar outlook,” said Sean Callow, a strategist at Westpac. The Fed’s reminder that its inflation target was symmetric was a clear negative for Treasury yields, and so the U.S. currency’s recovery was encouraging for dollar bulls, Callow said. Yet, the dollar had failed to breach key levels such as 110 versus the yen, $1.20 against the euro and $0.75 versus the Australian dollar, he added. It was last down 0.1 percent against the yen to 109.1, but was still set for a tiny weekly gain. “A 13-month low in eurozone inflation should have been a big boost for the dollar index - it was not. The payrolls report may not resolve this market battle,” Callow added. The U.S. dollar had erased all its 2018 losses in the past two weeks on expectations the Fed will continue to raise rates, even as other major central banks around the world, including the European Central Bank, take longer to reduce stimulus. The dollar index has risen about 1 percent so far this week and is on track for a third straight weekly gain. The euro took a small dip to be last at $1.1969 and is so far down 1.3 percent this week. Elsewhere, U.S. crude dipped 4 cents to $68.39 a barrel, while Brent crude down a shade at $73.58. Gold was slightly higher with spot gold at $1311.8 per ounce.

2018-05-04,"BANGKOK, May 4 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Vietnamese activist Khanh Nguy Thi knew early on that depending on coal to meet the country’s growing demand for energy would be a disaster for its people and the environment. She also knew that listening to women in the villages, and involving government officials in the conversation, were key to a greener future for the Southeast Asian country. It was Khanh’s combination of collaboration and pragmatism that helped convince Vietnam to rewrite its energy plan to reduce its dependency on coal, even as other activists in the region have struggled to make an impact. “Energy is important for economic development, and it also has a huge impact on the environment and the people. But there was very little involvement of the civil society in the government’s energy plans,” said Khanh. “Particularly women, who are also affected, but were not being heard, as decisions are made by men - it is important to listen to them,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Khanh last week was named as one of the recipients of the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize, known as the “Green Nobel”, which honours grassroots activism. She was one of two Asians to win the prize, which this year was dominated by women. Khanh’s work is critical as Vietnam develops a wave of new power plants to support economic growth that is among the fastest in Asia. Khanh set up Green Innovation and Development Centre (GreenID) in 2011 to educate communities on renewable energy, and convince officials on the merits of clean energy. She was instrumental in pushing the government to revise its long-term energy projections to reduce its planned coal expansion and cut emissions by up to 25 percent by 2030, in part by increasing power generated from wind, solar and biomass. She also halted the construction of two hydro-power plants in a national park, and helped design a gender impact assessment manual for hydro developers. Vietnam’s commitments are an exception in the region, where activists from Thailand to Cambodia are protesting coal-fired power plants and mega dams they say are harming the environment and forcing people off their lands. “Renewable energy, if done well with the participation of stakeholders including farmers, can help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and climate goals,” she said, referring to the U.N.’s set of global development goals to be met by 2030. The objectives include key energy targets of ensuring universal access to modern energy and increasing the share of renewables used. Vietnam is well placed to achieve those aims, “as we have abundant non-hydro renewable energy resources,” Khanh said. “There is a great opportunity for our nation to move beyond coal. As the mother of three kids, I want to make sure there is clean water, clean air and a clean environment for our kids.” (Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran. Editing by Jared Ferrie.

2018-05-04,"(Repeats Thursday’s story with no changes to text) * GRAPHIC: Map of Iran's nuclear facilities tmsnrt.rs/2rhijFf By Francois Murphy VIENNA, May 3 (Reuters) - The landmark 2015 nuclear deal Iran made with major world powers slashed the scope of Tehran’s atomic activities and created what the United Nations nuclear watchdog calls “the world’s most robust verification regime.” But U.S. President Donald Trump, a long-time critic of the deal, has threatened to pull out unless a follow-on agreement is reached to fix what he calls the deal’s “flaws.” Here is what a U.S. withdrawal would likely mean for the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog and its policing of Iran’s nuclear activities. A central aim of the agreement – signed by the United States, Russia, China, Germany, France and Britain - was to ensure Iran would be at least a year away from amassing enough nuclear material for a bomb. The deal made Tehran, among other things, sharply cut the number of centrifuges, machines that enrich uranium, it has in operation and slash its stock of enriched uranium. It also imposes a strict limit on the purity Iran enriches uranium to, far below the level at which it could be used in atom bombs. In signing the deal, Iran also agreed to comprehensive monitoring of its nuclear facilities and related sites by the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency. That includes daily access by inspectors to and continuous monitoring, such as by camera feed, of its two underground enrichment sites at Natanz and Fordow. The deal requires Iran to implement the U.N. nuclear watchdog’s Additional Protocol, which provides inspectors with wide-ranging access to information on Iran’s nuclear activities and the ability to inspect any site it deems necessary to verify that those activities are peaceful. The deal — officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA - requires Iran to grant long-term visas and provide proper working spaces to 130 to 150 designated U.N. nuclear inspectors. No. U.N. inspectors must present to Tehran their reason for wanting to visit a site that Iran has not declared as part of its nuclear programme. The U.N. nuclear watchdog does often conduct snap inspections. The head of the watchdog in March said that since the JCPOA has gone into effect the agency has carried out more than 60 so-called complementary access inspections. Many of those are done at short notice, diplomats familiar with the agency’s work say. The U.N. agency says it has had access to all the sites it has needed to visit and details of inspections are confidential. Iran and the U.N. nuclear watchdog say Iran is implementing its commitments under the deal. If Trump does not renew waivers of U.S. sanctions against Iran by May 12, as he has threatened to, it could unravel the deal by removing one of the main reasons Tehran signed up in the first place. According to the text of the deal, Iran stated that if sanctions were reinstated it “will treat that as grounds to cease performing its commitments under this JCPOA in whole or in part.” The three European signatories and the European Union, which also signed the deal, hope to keep the agreement alive even if the United States pulls out. Iran’s president has warned there would be “severe consequences” if Trump pulled out of the deal. But Iran has also discussed salvaging the deal. If Iran pulled out of the deal completely, it would dramatically reduce the U.N. nuclear watchdog’s ability to monitor the country’s activities. The U.N. agency says its presence in Iran in terms of inspectors’ calendar days doubled to 3,000 in 2017 compared to 2013. It adds that its “verification activities conducted” have increased 152 percent over that time frame, without specifying total numbers. U.N. inspectors would still monitor Iran’s declared nuclear facilities because Tehran is a signatory to the 1970 nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. But, U.N. inspectors would no longer have daily access to the Fordow and Natanz sites, for example, and would have more limited oversight of areas including uranium mining and research without nuclear material. Some Iranian officials have even threatened to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty, a drastic move that would involve expelling U.N. inspectors altogether as North Korea did in 2009. If Iran did pull out of the deal, the U.N. nuclear watchdog would hope that Tehran would continue to apply the protocol allowing it to retain much of its power to inspect any undeclared site it needs to. There is a precedent for this, even though Iran has not ratified the Additional Protocol since it signed it in 2003: Iran implemented it temporarily from 2003 to 2006.

Overnight, Argentina’s peso, which has been among the worst hit emerging market currencies during the past couple of months on rising U.S. yields, tumbled again to a record low. The currency has been hit by a lack of investor confidence in Latin America’s No. 3 economy, which has been blighted by one of the world’s highest inflation rates. Argentina’s central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 300 basis points to 33.25 percent on Thursday, but the second steep rate increase in less than a week failed to stop the peso currency from plunging. Elsewhere, U.S. crude dipped 7 cents to $68.36 a barrel, while Brent crude down a shade at $73.59. Gold was slightly higher. Spot gold was traded at $1313.4 per ounce.

2018-05-04,"* Asian shares down as markets wait for US payrolls * Eurozone inflation, US data fail to boost dollar * Indonesian stocks fall heavily, Argentine peso at record low By Vidya Ranganathan SINGAPORE, May 4 (Reuters) - Asian shares stepped back while the Japanese yen held onto overnight gains in early trading on Friday as financial markets turned their attention to the looming U.S. payrolls data for fresh catalysts. Investors were cautious after a largely weak performance on Wall Street overnight as some disappointing earnings reports offset strong economic data, while bond yields slid after a surprising slowdown in euro zone inflation. The U.S. dollar weakened during what was a choppy session a day after the Federal Reserve ended a policy meeting with no change in rates and a less hawkish statement than investors had anticipated. Disappointing U.S. company earnings, upbeat data on factory orders and the U.S. trade balance as well as the underwhelming eurozone inflation data made for a challenging trading environment. “Macro data from the U.S. and Europe are struggling to meet lofty expectations,” analysts at ANZ said in a note. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.26 percent, while the dollar dropped 0.2 percent against the yen to 108.98. Indonesian stocks led the declines, falling as much as 1.5 percent in early trading before recouping some of those losses. “The price action since the FOMC statement indicates a real division of opinion in markets over the US dollar outlook,” said Sean Callow, a strategist at Westpac. The Fed’s reminder that its inflation target was symmetric was a clear negative for Treasury yields, and so the U.S. currency’s recovery was encouraging for dollar bulls, Callow said. Yet the dollar had failed to breach key levels such as 110 versus the yen, $1.20 against the euro and $0.75 versus the Australian dollar, he said. “A 13-month low in eurozone inflation should have been a big boost for the dollar index - it was not. The payrolls report may not resolve this market battle.” The U.S. dollar had erased all its 2018 losses in the past two weeks on expectations the Fed will continue to raise rates, even as other major central banks around the world, including the European Central Bank, take longer to reduce stimulus. The focus for markets will be on the U.S. jobs data due later in the global day, with the April report likely to underscore labour market strength.  Nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 192,000 jobs last month, according to a Reuters survey of economists, after rising only 103,000 in March. Investors were also keeping a close watch on U.S.-China trade talks, though analysts said they had little confidence that the U.S. delegation in Beijing, led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, will achieve any breakthrough on the tariff standoff between the world’s two biggest economies. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 2.9477 percent compared with its U.S. close of 2.946 percent on Thursday. The two-year yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 2.4802 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.484 percent. Australian shares fell after a Reserve Bank of Australia statement that signalled the central bank sees faster economic growth this year and next but doubts inflation will reach the mid-point of its target band until 2020. Japan’s Nikkei stock index slid 0.16 percent. The euro was flat on the day at $1.1988 and has lost 0.74 percent in a month, while the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was down at 92.382. Overnight, Argentina’s peso, which has been among the worst hit emerging market currencies during the past couple of months on rising U.S. yields, tumbled again to a record low. The currency has been hit by a lack of investor confidence in Latin America’s No. 3 economy, which has been blighted by one of the world’s highest inflation rates. Argentina’s central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 300 basis points to 33.25 percent on Thursday, but the second steep rate increase in less than a week failed to stop the peso currency from plunging.

2018-05-04,"(Repeats without change. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2rgRG3d By John Kemp LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s financial position has stabilised as a result of the increase in oil prices as well as efforts to raise non-oil revenues and trim government spending. But the country probably needs even higher prices and revenues in the next few years to pay for its ambitious transformation programme while maintaining internal stability. The kingdom’s foreign reserves stood at $493 billion at the end of March 2018 and have been basically stable for eight months after declining steadily for nearly three years. The government has introduced a value-added tax and raised other fees and taxes to compensate for the decline in oil revenues during the slump and to diversify the revenue base. Utility prices have been increased and some subsidies have been reduced to ease pressure on the budget and clean up the accounts of the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco ahead of its planned share sale. But the biggest contribution to the improvement in the government’s budget and the balance of payments position has come from rising oil prices (tmsnrt.rs/2rgRG3d). Benchmark Brent prices have risen by about $47 a barrel, or 175 percent, since hitting a cyclical low in January 2016. As prices have risen, the kingdom’s drawdown on foreign reserves has eased and now stabilised, according to data from the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (“Monthly Statistical Bulletin”, SAMA, March 2018). The rise in oil revenues has provided much-needed fiscal breathing room and the International Monetary Fund has encouraged the government to slow the pace of tax increases and spending cuts. The government has announced big ambitions to transform the economy by diversifying away from oil and making it less dependent on state spending as part of its “Vision 2030”. In the meantime, however, the kingdom remains reliant on a single commodity to an unusual degree and almost the entire economy is linked to state spending. Commodity exports account for 30-40 percent of GDP and nearly all of this is crude oil, LPG and refined products, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. There was no reduction in the kingdom’s dependence on oil exports between 1995 and 2015 despite repeated pledges about diversification (“State of Commodity Dependence”, UNCTAD, 2017). In turn, oil revenues support an enormous number of government jobs. The kingdom depends far more on public employment than most other countries. Public sector jobs account for nearly 35 percent of all employment and the wage bill alone absorbs 12 percent of GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund. Real gross domestic product declined by 0.7 percent in 2017, the first annual decrease since 2009, according to the IMF (“Regional economic outlook: Middle East”, IMF, May 2018). The decline was because of a combination of lower oil production and the adverse impact of fiscal austerity on the rest of the economy. The government wants to shift the focus of the economy towards the non-oil private sector, but the transition will require enormous investment, even assuming it is eventually possible. Economic transformation will need hundreds of billions of dollars, and financing can come only from the kingdom’s internal resources, or in the form of foreign loans, equity sales or direct investment. The crown prince’s recent extended tour of the United States and Europe was intended partly as a roadshow to encourage foreign investment and partly to cement government-to-government alliances. But foreign investment on its own is unlikely to be enough,  given the scale of the task and lingering concerns about the kingdom’s political direction and business environment. So the country will need to find hundreds of billions of dollars from its own resources to complete the transformation programme and smooth the difficult transition. Official foreign assets amount to almost $500 billion and there are more held in various other government funds. But the kingdom needs to maintain a large cushion of liquid assets to ensure confidence in its fixed exchange rate against the dollar. Asset confiscations from wealthy Saudis and the nationalisation of domestic companies could raise extra funding but risk damaging investor confidence, so the potential for such measures is limited. As a result, the kingdom badly needs to maximise oil revenues now to pay for the transition to a less oil-dependent economy in future. Ironically, the desire to move away from petroleum dependence has made the kingdom even more reliant on oil in the short term. And the urgency of the reform process has turned it into the most hawkish member of OPEC on prices. Revenue requirements explain why the kingdom’s price policy has developed a clear upward tilt and why policymakers want to maintain OPEC production curbs for as long as possible.

2018-05-04,"BEIJING, May 4 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up on Friday, extending the previous session’s modest gains as looming geopolitical risks from possible new U.S. sanctions against Iran supported the market. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures added 3 cents to $68.46 per barrel by 0040 GMT. Brent crude oil futures were at $73.67 per barrel, up 5 cents, or 0.1 percent, from their last close. Iran’s foreign minister said on Thursday U.S. demands to change its 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers were unacceptable, as a deadline set by President Donald Trump for Europeans to “fix” the deal loomed. “Current prices reflect a premium for Iran uncertainties. Investors are worried about supplies after Iran took a tough stance in its response to the United States,” Wang Xiao, Head of Crude Research with Guotai Junan Futures said, adding that prices may fall if expectations of new sanctions ease. European powers still want to hand Trump a plan to save the Iran nuclear deal next week, but they have also started work on protecting EU-Iranian business ties if the U.S. president makes good on a threat to withdraw, six sources told Reuters. Markets will remain skittish as the May 12 deadline to rectify the deal approaches, ANZ Research said in note. Iran resumed its role as a major oil exporter in January 2016 when international sanctions against Tehran were lifted in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear program. Aside from security concerns, growing U.S. crude supplies are capping price gains. West Texas Intermediate crude for delivery in Midland slid for a fouth day on Thursday to hit their lowest in more than three-and-a-half years. WTI at Midland WTC-WTM traded as much as $14 a barrel below benchmark futures. Surging production in the Permian basin has continued to outpace pipeline capacity, while local refining issues have exacerbated oversupply in the region, dealers told Reuters. Multi-year low spot market prices followed U.S. government data that showed a 6.2-million-barrel jump in crude inventories last week.

2018-05-04,"(Adds details on coveted distributors, source quotes) SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO, May 3 (Reuters) - Brazil’s CPFL Energia SA is eyeing distribution assets being sold off by state-run utility Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras SA , three sources with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. The money-losing assets could eventually turn a profit if run by owners willing to invest in them, said the sources on condition of anonymity to discuss the confidential matter. CPFL, owned by China State Grid Corp, is particularly interested in Cepisa and Ceal, which operate in the northeastern states of Piauí and Alagoas, respectively, one person said. Another source said CPFL executives had visited Cepisa. The plan suggests CPFL’s attention turned to the auction of the Eletrobras distributors after the company dropped out of a bidding war to control Eletropaulo Metropolitana de São Paulo SA , Brazil’s largest distribution company by sales. CPFL, Brazil’s largest private-sector electricity group, was put off after two rivals raised their bids for Eletropaulo, making it too expensive, the sources said. “CPFL was eager to buy Eletropaulo, but the competition with Enel and Neoenergia increased the price tag to a level that cannot be justified,” one of the sources said. Last month Italy’s Enel SpA raised its takeover offer for Eletropaulo, as the São Paulo-based utility is known, to 32.20 reais per share. The bid valued Eletropaulo at 5.39 billion reais ($1.53 billion), and topped one by Neoenergia SA, controlled by Spain’s Iberdrola SA, of 32.10 reais per share. The government is expected to auction off six Eletrobras distribution companies in the north and northeast of Brazil by June. The auction has been postponed from this month because of an ongoing federal audit court analysis of the bidding rules.
