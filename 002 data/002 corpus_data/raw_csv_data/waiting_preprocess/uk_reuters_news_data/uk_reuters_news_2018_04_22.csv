2018-04-22,"LONDON/SEOUL (Reuters) - Britain and South Korea are in talks to protect an arrangement of tax breaks for Korean buyers of North Sea crude beyond Britain’s upcoming exit from the EU, officials from both countries said, although a breakthrough does not look imminent. An EU free-trade agreement has been in place since 2012 with South Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest economy and last year’s third-biggest importer of British North Sea crude, which is a significant source of revenue for the United Kingdom. Britain, which is trying to forge new trade relationships beyond Europe, will leave the EU next March and enjoy a status-quo transition until the end of 2020, according to the current plan. The current trade deal allows EU exporters to sell their oil to South Korean refineries tax-free, and Britain has been the biggest beneficiary of this break. A South Korean trade ministry official who has been part of the discussions, but declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to media, said talks were going on between the two countries on a new trade deal. “So far we have had two meetings after creating a so-called South Korea-UK trade working group. But as it’s not clear how details for the Brexit will be hashed out, at the moment, we have to wait and see.” Talks between Britain and the European Union on their future trade relationship after Brexit started this week. A spokesman for Britain’s Department for International Trade said the two sides hold regular discussions about how to retain the trade benefits, adding the “government will support (the oil) sector to maintain (its) reputation.”     The first meeting of the trade working group was held in Seoul in February 2017 and the second one was in London in  December. The South Korean official said the date for their third meeting has not been set yet. Last year, Korea imported 34.11 million barrels of British crude oil, up 83.5 percent from 2016, making up three percent of Korea’s total crude imports, according to data from state-run Korea National Oil Corp.  In the first two months of this year, South Korea imported 6.07 million barrels of British crude, down 1.67 per cent from a year ago. Britain’s Department for International Trade said its oil exports to South Korea in 2017 earned Britain two billion pounds  ($2.81 billion) and made up 14 percent of its total oil exports, the biggest share after the Netherlands and China. In 2016, Britain exported oil to South Korea worth 800 million pounds, or eight percent of Britain’s total oil exports.

2018-04-22,"(Repeats to widen distribution) * Modi to meet Xi on Friday, Saturday in China’s Wuhan * Modi seeking to re-set ties * Two sides have had major disagreements over border, Dalai Lama By Ben Blanchard BEIJING, April 22 (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit China this week for an informal meeting with President Xi Jinping, as efforts at rapprochement gather pace following a testing year in ties between the two giant neighbours. The Chinese government’s top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, said the two would meet on Friday and Saturday in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. “Our common interests far outweigh our differences. The two countries have no choice other than pursuing everlasting friendship, mutually beneficial cooperation and common development,” Wang told reporters after meeting Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj in Beijing. “The summit will go a long way towards deepening the mutual trust between the two great neighbours,” he added. “We will make sure that the informal summit will be a complete success and a new milestone in the history of China-India relations.” Modi has sought to re-set ties after disputes over issues including their disputed border with Tibet and other issues. The discussion with Wang was to prepare for the informal summit, Swaraj said. “It will be an important occasion for them (Modi and Xi) to exchange views on bilateral and international matters, from an overarching and long-term perspective with the objective of enhancing mutual communication,” Swaraj said. The Asian giants were locked in a 73-day military stand-off in a remote, high-altitude stretch of that boundary last year. At one point, soldiers from the two sides threw stones and punches. The confrontation between the nuclear-armed powers in the Himalayas underscored Indian alarm at China’s expanding security and economic links in South Asia. China’s ambitious Belt and Road initiative of transport and energy links bypasses India, apart from a corner of the disputed Kashmir region, also claimed by Pakistan, but involves India’s neighbours Sri Lanka, Nepal and the Maldives. Modi’s previously unannounced Wuhan trip is even more unusual in that he will visit China again in June for a summit in Qingdao of the China and Russia-led security grouping, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which India joined last year. It is almost unheard of for foreign leaders to visit China twice in such close succession. Xi is also extending Modi the rare honour of a meeting outside of Beijing, which almost never happens unless there is a multilateral summit taking place. Modi’s nationalist government has reversed course on its relationship with Beijing apparently after realising its hard line on China was not working. Exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, who lives in India and who China considers a dangerous separatist, is also facing the cold shoulder. In March, India issued an unprecedented ban on Tibetans holding a rally with the Dalai Lama in New Delhi to mark the 60th anniversary of the start of the failed uprising against Chinese rule. Other areas of disagreement remain however between Beijing and New Delhi. China has blocked India’s membership of a nuclear cartel and it has also been blocking U.N. sanctions against a Pakistan-based militant leader blamed for attacks on India.

2018-04-22,"YEREVAN (Reuters) - Police in Armenia detained three opposition leaders and nearly 200 protesters on Sunday, drawing a rebuke from the European Union after demonstrators demanded newly appointed Prime Minister Serzh Sarksyan quit.  Protesters accuse Sarksyan, 63, of clinging to power after parliament made him prime minister this month following a stint of 10 years as president. In the biggest political crisis in a decade, tens of thousands of his opponents have marched through the capital Yerevan, blocking streets and staging sit-ins. The protests, though peaceful so far, threaten to destabilise a key Russian ally in a volatile region riven by a long low level conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan and would, if successful, be a rare example of people power delivering reform in the former Soviet Union. Critics accuse Sarksyan of ruling the South Caucasus nation of around 3 million people for too long, of being too close to Russia which has military bases inside Armenia, and of doing too little to root out corruption.  Sarksyan says his country needs him and that his party enjoys large-scale popular support.   Under a revised constitution approved in a 2015 referendum, most state powers shifted to the prime minister while the presidency has become a largely ceremonial post. Police said in a statement that opposition politician Nikol Pashinyan and two other lawmakers had been “forcibly removed” from a protest. A Reuters reporter witnessed the “red berets”, as Armenian special police forces are known, grab one lawmaker by his hands and feet and carry him behind the police cordon. The public prosecution service confirmed that three opposition leaders had been detained on suspicion of organising an illegal protest. Almost 200 people have been taken to police stations by law enforcement officers, the Interfax news agency cited police representatives as saying. Seven people had been taken to hospital, the Ministry of Health said in a statement. According to the law, the detainees must either be released within 72 hours, or a criminal case can be opened against them. Opposition leader Pashinyan had earlier held talks with Sarksyan, who walked out of the meeting within minutes after accusing his opponents of trying to “blackmail” the authorities. “This is not talks, not a dialogue, it’s just an ultimatum, blackmail of the state, of the legitimate authorities,” Sarksyan had said.  Demonstrators continued to march in large numbers in the capital, blowing vuvuzelas and sounding car horns, despite earlier attempts by police to break up the march with batons and shields. The police called on protesters to stop the situation from escalating, the Interfax news agency said, quoting an official statement. “If these demands are not fulfilled, the police has the right to take demonstrators into custody and to use force,” Interfax cited the statement as saying. Tens of thousands of protesters gathered on the capital’s central Republic square in the evening, calling for the continuation of peaceful protests. “I’m asking everyone not to deviate from the declared path and peacefully bring the case of the resignation of Serzh Sarksyan,” Anna Hakobyan, Pashinyan’s wife told the crowd. In a statement, the EU’s foreign policy arm called for more dialogue and a peaceful resolution. “All those who have been detained while exercising their fundamental right of assembly in accordance with the law must be released immediately,” it said. “It is of utmost importance that all parties involved show restraint and act responsibly.” Parliament voted last Tuesday to allow Sarksyan to become prime minister, angering opposition leaders. “I am telling you: you have no understanding of the situation in the country. The situation is different to the one you knew 15-20 days ago,” Pashinyan had told Sarksyan on Sunday. “The situation in Armenia has changed, you don’t have the power of which you are told. In Armenia, the power has passed to the people,” he said.

2018-04-22,"TUNIS/LONDON (Reuters) - Libya is considering whether to intervene in a $450 million deal that French major Total (TOTF.PA) announced last month to buy Marathon Oil’s stake in the country’s Waha concessions, several sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Officials were considering a range of options ranging from pushing for better terms - after some in the oil industry and the media said the price was too low - to a counter-offer from the state National Oil Corporation (NOC), the sources said.  “The NOC wants to buy the Total part,” one source from the leadership of Libya’s internationally recognised government, the Presidency Council, said. He added that officials were examining the value of the 16.33 percent Waha share with a view to possibly raising funds for a counter offer with money from Libya’s $67 billion sovereign wealth fund, the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA). “They think of the LIA as a potential financier ... LIA is exploring it, the process is just starting,” the source said Libya had not given the required formal approval to the Total-Marathon deal, meaning it could be blocked, the source added.     NOC declined to comment. The Libyan Investment Authority did not immediately provide a response. Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne told reporters at an industry event in Paris on Thursday that the deal was all but settled. “The transaction is closed,” Pouyanne said. “There are some discussions on some fiscal issues with the government, but it will be done.”   A spokeswoman for Marathon Oil said the company had already received payment for the sale of its share. A Libyan oil source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that at least some within the NOC found the price Total was paying too low. The deal was “still under consideration and negotiations between many parties here in Tripoli”, a second oil Libyan oil source said. NOC holds a 59.18 percent stake in Waha Oil Co. Other stakeholders are ConocoPhillips (COP.N) with 16.33 percent and Hess (HES.N) with 8.16 percent. Waha’s output of 300,000 boe/d is expected to rise to 400,000 boe/d by the end of the decade, according to production figures given by Total when it announced the deal in early March. Total said the deal would give it access to reserves and resources in excess of 500 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe), with immediate production of around 50,000 boe/d (per day) and “significant exploration potential” in concessions in the Sirte Basin. The stake carries production risks - a Waha pipeline has been hit twice in the past four months by suspected attacks, most recently on Saturday. But it also gives Total a presence at fields in eastern Libya, where most of the country’s oil resources lie. Total already had stakes in the giant southwestern Sharara field, and the offshore Al Jurf field along the Tunisian border. Libya has been split between rival military factions and governments based in the west and east of the country since 2014. The eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) has allowed the NOC in Tripoli to operate facilities on LNA territory, while opposing the internationally recognised government in the capital.  The Waha concessions, granted decades ago, are governed by a law that stipulates that Libya’s oil ministry must approve the deal, the Presidency Council source said. Since the oil ministry is not currently operational, that power falls to the Presidency Council, he said, though the NOC has previously disputed the Council’s attempts to take over oil ministry powers.

Transport has been a laggard among efforts by industry to agree emissions cuts, with shipping and aviation not part of a global climate pact reached in Paris in 2015. But the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), the U.N. agency responsible for regulating pollution from ships, this month reached a deal to cut CO2 by 2050 from 2008 levels. Hapag-Lloyd, the world’s number five container company, said in a statement on Sunday it had already cut the CO2 emissions of its fleet by 46 percent between 2007 and 2016. “What matters now is for all market players to pull together in the same direction,” said Chief Executive Rolf Habben Jansen. Hapag-Lloyd has modernised its fleet through its purchase of Gulf peer UASC, switching to more efficient vessels.
