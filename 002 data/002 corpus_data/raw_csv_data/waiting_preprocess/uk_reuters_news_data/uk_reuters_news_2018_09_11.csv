2018-09-11,"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 11 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - L eading philanthropists pledged hundreds of millions of dollars to rescue shrinking tropical forests that suck heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, on the eve of a global climate change summit in San Francisco. Nine foundations announced the $459 million commitment, to be delivered over the next four years, a day ahead of the Global Climate Action Summit, which is expected to draw about 4,500 delegates from city and regional governments. “While the world heats up, many of our governments have been slow - slow to act. And so we in philanthropy must step up,” Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, told journalists at an event announcing the pledge. The commitment roughly doubles the funds the groups currently dedicate to forest protection, said David Kaimowitz, a director at the Ford Foundation, one of the donors. Charlotte Streck, director of Amsterdam-based think tank Climate Focus, said the size of the commitment makes the groups major players in supporting anti-deforestation programs. Norway has led donor efforts by pledging up to $500 million a year to help tropical nations protect their forests, Streck said. But the new money committed by foundations could prove more “flexible and nimble” than money from governments, she said. “The money that has been pledged by the governments like Norway and Germany, the UK, sits mostly in trust funds with the World Bank and the U.N. and it doesn’t get out so quickly,” she said. Often “there is $20,000 missing here or $50,000 missing here, just to do one thing or develop one study or work with one person or have one consultation - and that the foundations can do”, Streck said. Other groups that are part of the new initiative include the MacArthur Foundation and The Rockefeller Foundation. Funds will mostly assist indigenous people who are forest dwellers, including by helping them secure titles to land they live on so it cannot be sold to private companies without their agreement, said Walker. “Companies come to our village, our forests and say: ‘You have to leave because I have the license from the government’,” said Rukka Sombolinggi, who heads the Indonesia-based Indigenous People’s Alliance of the Archipelago (AMAN). The world loses the equivalent of 50 soccer fields’ worth of forest every minute, organizers said. Yet forests absorb a third of the annual planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions produced - and those emissions need to be slashed substantially more to meet the goals set in the Paris agreement. The Paris climate agreement, adopted by almost 200 nations in 2015, set a goal of limiting warming to “well below” a rise of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6°F) above pre-industrial times while “pursuing efforts” for the tougher goal of 1.5 degrees C. The three-day Global Climate Action Summit was organized by Californian authorities and the United Nations to support the leadership of mayors, governors and other sub-national authorities in curbing climate change.

2018-09-11,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose more than 2 percent on Tuesday as U.S. sanctions squeezed Iranian crude exports and after U.S. crude oil production in 2019 was forecast to grow at a slower rate than previously expected, prompting supply concerns. Since spring when the Trump Administration said it would impose sanctions on Iran, crude traders have priced in a risk premium reflecting the supply shortages that may occur when exports from the third-largest OPEC member are cut. As the Nov. 4 date for imposing sanctions draws nearer, the premium has increased.   Brent crude futures rose $1.69, or 2.2 percent, to settle at $79.06 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled $1.71, or 2.5 percent, higher at $69.25 a barrel. Prices extended gains in post-settlement trade after industry data from the American Petroleum Institute showed U.S. crude inventories slumped 8.6 million barrels last week, versus analysts’ forecasts of a 805,000-barrel decrease. Official U.S. government data is due to be released on Wednesday.     Washington has told its allies to reduce imports of Iranian oil and several Asian buyers, including South Korea, Japan and India appear to be falling in line. But the U.S. government does not want to push up oil prices, which could depress economic activity or even trigger a slowdown in global growth. U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry met Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih on Monday in Washington, as the Trump administration encourages big oil-producing countries to keep output high. Perry will meet with Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak on Thursday in Moscow. Graphic: Iran oil exports to Asia png (tmsnrt.rs/2CEzade) Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia are the world’s three biggest oil producers by far, meeting around a third of the world’s almost 100 million barrels per day (bpd) of daily crude consumption. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Tuesday that Russia and a group of producers around the Middle East which dominate the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries may sign a new long-term cooperation deal at the beginning of December, the TASS news agency reported. Novak did not provide details. A group of OPEC and non-OPEC producers have been voluntarily withholding supplies since January 2017 to tighten markets, but with crude prices up by more than 40 percent since then and markets significantly tighter, there has been pressure on producers to raise output. U.S. crude production is expected to rise 840,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 11.5 million bpd next year, lower than a previous expectation for a rise of 1.02 million bpd to 11.7 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in a monthly report. “Market participants are now evaluating this development in conjunction with potential for further declines in oil output from Iran and Venezuela, which portrays a significantly bullish picture on prices,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy in London.   Graphic: U.S. crude oil is at a steep discount to Brent png (tmsnrt.rs/2oZsRqZ) On Monday several armed men attacked the headquarters of Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) in the capital Tripoli on Monday. The NOC has continued to function relatively normally amid chaos in Libya. Oil production has been hit by attacks on oil facilities and blockades, though last year it partially recovered to around one million barrels per day. As Middle East markets tighten, Asian buyers are seeking alternative supplies, with South Korean and Japanese imports of U.S. crude hitting a record in September. U.S. oil producers are seeking new buyers for crude they used to sell to China before orders slowed because of the trade disputes between Washington and Beijing.

2018-09-11,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A broad index of world stock markets posted gains for a second straight day on Tuesday, as investors piled into U.S. technology and energy stocks even as a trade war loomed. MSCI’s index of global equities .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.17 percent as investors awaited action from U.S. President Donald Trump after a deadline for public comment on additional tariffs on Chinese goods expired. Wall Street continued its rally, with the benchmark S&P 500 stock index still on pace to deliver what once seemed improbable: a seventh year of double-digit percentage gains over the last decade. Shares of Apple Inc (AAPL.O) surged 2.5 percent a day ahead of the highly anticipated unveiling of the company’s new iPhone models. Energy stocks got a boost from a rally in oil prices. U.S. job openings surged to a record high in July and more Americans voluntarily quit their jobs, pointing to sustained labour market strength and confidence that could soon spur faster wage growth. While that data may point to higher wages that could chip away at corporate profits, it also showcases a strong economy. Markets may see more stimulus this year from additional tax cuts being pondered by congressional Republicans. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 113.99 points, or 0.44 percent, to 25,971.06, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 10.76 points, or 0.37 percent, to 2,887.89, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 48.31 points, or 0.61 percent, to 7,972.47. [.N] “The fact that Trump still hasn’t announced the tariffs yet as expected has prompted a bit of cautious optimism, but it’s not a problem that’s going to go away,” said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson. Emerging markets remained under pressure, with an index of those countries’ shares .MSCIEF down 0.66 percent and touching their lowest level in nearly 16 months. Those markets’ currencies .MIEM00000CUS are also at their lowest level in more than a year, with some near record lows against the U.S. dollar. Copper, heavily consumed by emerging markets, lost 0.51 percent to $5,880.00 a tonne. CMCU3 China told the World Trade Organisation on Tuesday it wanted to impose $7 billion a year in sanctions on the United States in retaliation for Washington’s non-compliance with a ruling in a dispute over U.S. dumping duties. Trump told reporters on Tuesday that the United States was taking a tough stance with China, but he described trade talks with Canada as going well. “Weakness is set to remain a recurring theme amid global trade tensions, a broadly stronger dollar and prospects of higher U.S. interest rates,” said Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst at broker FXTM. “With turmoil in Turkey and Argentina triggering contagion fears, appetite for emerging market assets and currencies is likely to continue diminishing.” Oil prices ignored the threat to demand posed by a trade war that could slow economic growth, taking their cue instead from looming U.S. sanctions against Iran’s petroleum industry that could hurt supply.

2018-09-11,"(Reuters) - The Trump administration on Tuesday proposed weakening requirements for testing and repairing methane leaks in drilling operations, among other measures, in a step toward rolling back an Obama-era policy to combat climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said the changes will save the industry $75 million a year in regulatory costs between 2019 and 2025, while increasing methane emissions. Methane, the primary component of natural gas, leaks from oil and gas wells during drilling. It accounts for 10 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and has more than 80 times the heat-trapping potential of carbon dioxide in the first 20 years after it escapes into the atmosphere.  The oil and gas sector is the largest single source of U.S. methane emissions, according to EPA data.  The proposal is the latest move by the Trump administration to roll back environmental rules put in place by former President Barack Obama. Last month, the administration proposed rolling back  tougher fuel efficiency standards for vehicles and moved to replace a policy to limit emissions from power plants with one that would allow states to write their own standards. Last year, it delayed implementing the Obama-era rule limiting methane gas emissions from oil and gas operations on federal and tribal lands.  Under the new proposal methane gas emissions will increase by a total 380,000 short tons between 2019 and 2025 compared with the EPA’s 2018 baseline estimate. Obama’s updates to the EPA’s New Source Performance Standards envisioned preventing emissions of 300,000 short tons of methane in 2020, rising to preventing 510,000 short tons of methane emissions in 2025. “It’s unfortunate that the Trump Administration is once again ignoring facts and common sense only to put the interests of the nation’s worst-run oil and gas companies ahead of the health and welfare of all Americans,” Matt Watson, associate vice president, energy, for the Environmental Defense Fund, said in a statement. The proposal is subject to public comments for 60 days, including a public hearing to be held in Denver, EPA said.

2018-09-11,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU governments are failing to comply with air quality limits that are already weaker than the World Health Organization’s recommendations, the bloc’s auditors said on Tuesday. The findings by European Union’s watchdog come as Brussels is taking half a dozen member states to court over their failure to enforce the bloc’s air quality laws. Respiratory illness caused by pollution result in some 400,000 premature deaths a year, costing governments heavily in health care expenses, the European Court of Auditors found.   “There are still considerable impacts on public health,” said Janusz Wojciechowski, one of the report’s authors.  As many as 23 out of the bloc 28-nations are failing to comply with the existing limits on harmful pollutants such as nitrogen oxide and particulate matter, according to EU data. Responding to the report, the EU executive said it was stepping up action to reduce pollution and defended its policy record, pointing to improvements in some areas. “The Commission is fully aware that there is still an urgent need to further improve air quality in Europe,” a European Commission spokesman said. The Commission said in May it would sue Britain, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy and Romania at the bloc’s highest court for breaching rules on air pollutants.

2018-09-11,"Sept 11 (Reuters) - U.S. motorists are feeling the effects of Hurricane Florence as gas prices at the pump rose this week and stations in the Southeastern evacuation zones faced a run on fuel supplies. More than 1.5 million people were ordered on Tuesday to evacuate their homes along the U.S. southeast coast to escape Hurricane Florence, a major Category 4 storm expected to make landfall in the Carolinas later this week. Gas prices in South Carolina have climbed by about 8 cents to $2.585 a gallon from a week earlier, according to motorists’ advocacy group AAA. Early Tuesday, nearly 6 percent of Wilmington, North Carolina stations reported running out of supplies, said retail tracking service GasBuddy. “I’m looking across the street at a gas station, and it’s a madhouse. People are honking at each other, cars are almost lined up out to the street,” Lauren Hancock, a resident of Wrightsville Beach in the state’s evacuation zone, said on Tuesday. “There are several gas stations out of gas.” Officials in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina this week warned against price gouging by retailers, citing penalties for violating state of emergency rules against excessive price increases. The southeast United States is largely supplied with fuel via Colonial Pipeline, which carries more than 3 million barrels per day of gasoline, diesel and other fuels to markets in the southern and eastern United States. Its operator was preparing for potential flooding and loss of power. The pipeline was operating normally on Tuesday and has reached out to customers to coordinate any changes in service that might arise from future terminal closures, spokesman Steve Baker said in an email. The Raleigh-Durham Airport Authority has ordered additional supplies of gasoline to fuel airport fleet vehicles, spokesman Andrew Sawyer said by phone. Brokers and wholesalers in the Carolinas said they were starting to see stockpiles dwindle. “As a resident of the South East and pretty much in the way of Florence, we are already running out of gasoline,” said Scott Shelton, an energy broker at ICAP in Durham, North Carolina. “There have been some spotty outages of certain products in some areas,” said Michael Fields, executive director of the South Carolina Petroleum Marketers Association, whose members include convenience store operators. “With a million people leaving the coasts and coming inland, there’s going to be some issues.” (Reporting by Liz Hampton in Houston, Devika Krishna Kumar, Stephanie Kelly and Ayenat Mersie in New York; Editing by Richard Chang)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/storm-florence-gasoline/fuel-prices-shortages-rising-as-hurricane-florence-speeds-to-u-s-coast-idUKL3N1VX4JF,11 Sep 2018,"U.S. motorists are feeling the effects

The latest September output projection for 2018 was down from the EIA’s 81.10-bcfd forecast in August but would still easily top the current annual record high of 74.15 bcfd produced on average in 2015. EIA also projected U.S. gas consumption would rise to an all-time high of 79.81 bcfd in 2018 from 74.20 bcfd in 2017. That 2018 demand projection in the September STEO report was up from EIA’s 79.57-bcfd forecast for the year in its August report and would top the current annual record high of 75.10 bcfd consumed on average in 2016. In 2019, EIA projected output would rise to 84.65 bcfd, while usage would slip to 79.67 bcfd. After the United States became a net gas exporter for the first time in 60 years in 2017, EIA projected U.S. net exports would rise to 2.0 bcfd in 2018 and 5.8 bcfd in 2019, up from 0.4 bcfd in 2017. In electric generation, EIA projected gas would remain the primary U.S. power plant fuel in 2018 and 2019 after it took that title from coal for the first time in 2016. EIA projected gas’ share of generation would rise to 34 percent in 2018 and 35 percent in 2019 from 32 percent in 2017. Coal’s share of generation, meanwhile, was forecast to slide to 28 percent in 2018 and 27 percent in 2019 from 30 percent in 2017. The EIA projected the electric sector would only burn 648.2 million short tons of coal in 2018, which would be the lowest in 35 years, and 615.9 million short tons in 2019, the lowest since 1982. That compares with 664.7 million short tons in 2017, which was the lowest amount since 1984. U.S. carbon emissions have dropped as the power sector burns less coal. After U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide emissions declined to 5,142 million tonnes in 2017, the least since 1992, EIA projected they would rise to 5,260 million tonnes in 2018 and 5,212 million tonnes in 2019 because of changes in weather, economic growth and energy prices.

2018-09-11,"(Adds demand projections, comments, prices) NEW YORK, Sept 11 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil production in 2019 is expected to grow at a slower rate than previously forecast, according to a monthly U.S. government forecast on Tuesday. U.S. crude production is expected to rise by 840,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 11.5 million bpd next year, lower than a previous expectation for it to rise 1.02 million bpd to 11.7 million, according to a report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Oil demand growth in 2019 is expected to rise by 250,000 bpd, a decrease from EIA’s previous projection for an increase of 290,000 bpd. The agency largely left 2018 production and demand growth forecasts unchanged. A shale boom has helped send U.S. production surging above 10 million bpd this year for the first time since the 1970s. But drilling activity in the Permian basin, the largest U.S. oil patch, has begun showing signs of a slowdown due to limited pipeline takeaway capacity. U.S. crude oil production in 2018 is expected to grow 1.31 million barrels per day (bpd) to 10.66 million bpd, little changed from EIA’s previous forecast. Demand in 2018 is likely to grow by 470,000 bpd, also unchanged. “EIA’s September outlook revised expectations for Brent spot prices upward to an average of $73 per barrel for 2018,” EIA Administrator Linda Capuano said. “The change was largely due to lower expectations for Canada’s crude oil production and OPEC’s condensate production,” she said. Saudi Arabia wants oil to stay between $70 and $80 a barrel for now as the world’s biggest crude exporter strikes a balance between maximizing revenue and keeping a lid on prices until U.S. congressional elections in November, OPEC and industry sources have told Reuters. EIA forecasts Brent spot prices to average $74 per barrel in 2019. Oil prices rose more than 2 percent on Tuesday, with Brent crude futures up $1.48 to $78.85 a barrel by 12:36 p.m. EDT (1636 GMT). U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained $1.74 to trade at $69.28 a barrel.

2018-09-11,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s consumer protection association and auto club ADAC will on Wednesday present a class action against Volkswagen over the carmaker’s manipulation of emissions software. The association, known as vzbv, said on Tuesday it wants to get compensation for some two million owners of Volkswagen diesel cars that are not as environmentally friendly as the company said they are at the time of purchase. The class action was made possible after the German cabinet approved a draft law in May that to make it easier for people to join a legal test case, avoiding high costs that might otherwise put them off bringing legal action. Under the new law, owners of cars with illegal software are allowed to claim damages only until the end of 2018. VW, which in 2015 admitted it had used illegal software to cheat U.S. emissions tests, said after the draft law was approved that it believes the claims against it in Germany are unjustified, and it expects the majority of them to be rejected.

2018-09-11,"PARIS (Reuters) - French supermarket and retail chain Leclerc, will start selling electricity to French households this week, offering a discount of at least 10 percent to regulated prices as it aims to recruit three million clients by 2025. Privately-owned Leclerc is France’s largest food retailer by market share, having overtaken rival Carrefour (CARR.PA) thanks mostly to its focus on low prices. It joins a growing list of French companies trying to win customers from state-controlled utility EDF (EDF.PA), a former monopoly that still controls the lion’s share — about 80 percent — of France’s power market of 32.4 million customers. Leclerc hopes entering the market will diversify revenue and boost customer loyalty in a retail world increasingly challenged by technology giant Amazon (AMZN.O) and other innovators. “This is a long-term and incremental approach. The goal is to serve three million customers and reach a market share of 10 percent by 2025,” Chief Executive Michel-Edouard Leclerc told Reuters by telephone. In time, Leclerc could seek to supply business clients, he said without providing details. From Sept. 13, Leclerc will offer households access to regulated electricity prices at a 10 percent discount for at least one year. A discount of 20 percent will be offered to the 14.2 million customers who hold Leclerc’s loyalty card. The savings to loyalty card holders will be offered as vouchers to use in the network of 681 stores around the country. Leclerc, with sales of 37.2 billion euros ($43.09 billion)in 2017, has pledged that the new service, called Energies E. Leclerc, will be “the cheapest in the market”. “Our objective is clearly to win market share and that means to sacrifice margins. Very clearly, we will initially favour the customers who know us in order to grow fast,” Leclerc said. “Leclerc’s strategy is to develop its offers. We will continue to develop our food and non-food offers but we will increasingly grow into services,” he said. In the 1980s, Leclerc started selling petrol, and the CEO said the firm was now France’s second-largest gas station operator after oil group Total (TOTF.PA). Leclerc is the second major retailer to enter the French power market following Casino’s (CASP.PA) online subsidiary Cdiscount, which last year started offering retail customers a 15 percent discount to regulated electricity prices. Cdiscount CEO Emmanuel Grenier said he was not worried about Leclerc’s entry into energy as “each time a new operator comes in, it focuses attention on alternative energy operators”. Despite the arrival of newcomers in French power retailing, which opened to competition a decade ago, EDF still controls 80 percent of the market.  More than 30 alternative gas and electricity suppliers operate in the French retail market, including Italy’s Eni. “The energy market is opening up...It’s the right time to enter and secure a market share,” said Yves Marin, partner at Bartle Business Consulting. Retailers around the world including Wal-Mart (WMT.N) have become involved in energy, often as a way to become self-sufficient on energy, with solar panels and wind farms.

2018-09-11,"* Sonangol awards fuel oil deal to France’s Total * Trafigura was dominant player in Angola * President reshuffles oil industry after Dos Santos exit By Dmitry Zhdannikov LONDON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Trafigura has lost its last big contract in Angola, once a core market and revenue generator for the trading house, as the country’s new president Joao Lourenco part ways with oil firms that worked with his predecessor Jose Eduardo Dos Santos. Trafigura, which declined to comment, lost the rights to sell Angolan fuel oil this year, with the contract going to French oil major Total, two trading sources said. Fuel oil was the last major Angolan contract Trafigura had, with volumes of 1.1 million tonnes in 18 cargoes over 2017 worth some $450 million. Total is now expected to market a similar amount for Angolan state oil company Sonangol in 2019. “It is part of broader oil industry reforms that were ordered by Lorenco. The fuel oil contract change effectively completes this process on the trading side,” a source familiar with how Sonangol sells its oil and products told Reuters. Sonangol declined to comment on the changes. Lourenco said shortly after taking office in September 2017 that he was committed to economic reforms and ordered a review of Angola’s oil industry. He has since pushed out prominent figures from key state roles, including the former president’s daughter Isabel dos Santos, who was head of Sonangol. Trafigura has long been the main player in Angolan oil, helping Sonangol sell large volumes of crude and fuel oil and also importing gasoline, gasoil and other refined products. The trading house was also a large lender to Sonangol - with debt guaranteed by future fuel sales, although the sources said the African country had now repaid all loans. Sonangol also changed the way it imported refined products with Trafigura losing out in March on the right to supply 2 million tonnes a year of gasoil in 21 cargoes to rival Glencore. In addition it lost the rights to import some 300,000-400,000 tonnes of bunker fuel to Total, which has also won the right to supply 1.2 million tonnes of gasoline to Angola, a contract previously held by Vitol. Total, one of the biggest foreign operators in Angola, has been steadily expanding production with the launch this summer the offshore Kaombo project and reaching a framework agreement with Sonangol to develop a retail station network.

2018-09-11,"PARIS (Reuters) - Lawmakers in France’s ruling party are pushing for a ban on plastic water bottles in school canteens from 2020 as consumers and governments become increasingly aware of the damaging impact of plastic that ends up in landfills or in the ocean. The measure is part of a draft field-to-fork bill that also includes a ban on plastic straws and hot-drink stirrers. Legislators begin a second reading of the bill in the National Assembly on Wednesday. As companies and households pay more attention to their green credentials, the European Union has also put forward a ban on single-use plastic products which have environmentally friendly alternatives. Plastic waste has become a scourge of the 21st century, blighting landscapes and killing marine life. Research published in the digital journal Scientific Reports estimates that a monster 79,000-metric tonne plastic garbage patch - 1.8 trillion pieces - has formed in the Pacific Ocean. Lawmakers in the centre-right-dominated Senate had stripped the school bottle ban out of the bill at its first reading, but ruling party lawmakers in the lower house reinserted it. The lower house has the final say after two readings. Senators who oppose the move said that tap water was sometimes more polluted and harmful than plastic bottles. An agriculture ministry spokesman could not say how many drinks in plastic bottles are served in school canteens each year. France has already said it plans to make bottles produced with recycled plastic cheaper than bottles made from virgin plastic. Other proposals in the food law include a rise in the minimum price paid by retailers on food products and price benchmarks that take into account farmers’ costs in contracts, animal welfare regulations, and environment-friendly practices. Some lawmakers in the lower house are also proposing to include a ban on the weed-killer glyphosate in the bill, farm ministry officials said. The government has said it wants to outlaw glyphosate within three years but has faced stiff resistance from farm lobbies.

2018-09-11,"(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is planning to spend more than 500 million pounds to upgrade the UK’s largest oil refinery, Fawley, on England’s south coast, a spokesman said on Tuesday. The project at the 270,000 barrel per day refinery - representing a fifth of British refining capacity - still needs a final investment decision which is not expected before the second quarter of next year, Exxon said. The planned upgrade, which would include building a new hydrotreater and a new hydrogen plant, would reduce Britain’s reliance on diesel imports. “ExxonMobil is considering significant upgrades at its Fawley site to help meet demand in the UK market for high quality fuels,” Exxon said in a statement. “If approved, the project, which is expected to involve an investment of hundreds of millions of pounds, will ... allow the site to process a wider selection of crude oils, and will help secure future employment for 1,000 employees at the site.” A spokesman confirmed a report in the Financial Times that the investment, if finalised, would amount to more than 500 million pounds. The upgrade will allow the refinery to refine heavier, sourer barrels into ultra-low sulphur diesel, the FT reported.

2018-09-11,"BRAUNSCHWEIG, Germany (Reuters) - Former Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) boss Martin Winterkorn was slow to address emissions test cheating that led to huge U.S. fines, a judge hearing a damages case brought by investors against the German carmaker said on Tuesday.  The question of who knew what, and when, will be vital in determining the outcome of the suit in which investors are seeking 9.2 billion euros ($10.6 billion) in damages for share price losses suffered when the scandal became public. Separately, a consumer rights group said it would file a class-action lawsuit on Wednesday against VW over the manipulation of emissions software, seeking compensation for up to 2 million owners of affected diesel models. The plaintiffs in the first case say Volkswagen (VW) failed in its duty to inform them about the financial impact of the scandal, which broke when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a so-called notice of violation on Sept. 18, 2015. Judge Christian Jaede said then-CEO Winterkorn had dragged his feet after a top-level management meeting two months earlier discussed how to deal with U.S. regulators who were threatening to ban VW because of excessive pollution levels. The plaintiffs say that from this moment, Winterkorn was aware of the cheating.  “Anyone acting in good faith would have followed up on this information,” Jaede said on the second day of hearings into the case at the Braunschweig higher regional court. “This appears not to have happened.” It was not clear, the judge added, why the company had not put out a statement after establishing that engine software had been manipulated to get around emissions tests. The judge also said it was reasonable to take the view that Winterkorn knew about the emissions cheating far earlier. However, Thomas Liebscher, a lawyer for VW, said it would be unfair to assume the chief executive knew how the company’s engine management software worked. Winterkorn resigned in the days after the scandal broke. He told German lawmakers in early 2017 that he did not find out about the cheating any earlier than VW had officially admitted. His lawyer was not immediately available for comment on Tuesday. The 71-year old faces U.S. criminal charges, filed in May, accusing him of conspiring to cover up the ‘dieselgate’ scandal. VW has also said it may seek damages from him. The plaintiffs say VW failed in its duty to inform investors about the potential financial implications of the emissions test cheating, which has cost the company 27.4 billion euros in penalties and fines so far. Had investors known about VW’s cheating, they might have sold shares earlier or not made purchases, thereby avoiding losses on their holdings, the plaintiffs argue. VW shares lost up to 37 percent in value in the days after the scandal broke.  The company has argued it did not inform investors of the issue because it did not want to endanger the chance of reaching a settlement with the U.S. authorities.  Jaede said this would only have been legitimate if a settlement could have been reached quickly and VW had cooperated with the U.S. authorities to the best of its efforts.  The judge told the opening day of the trial that VW’s decision between 2005 and 2007 to install cheating software in diesel vehicles was illegal, but it was not clear that the intent was to deceive investors. Fund manager Deka Investment brought the case, known in German as a Musterklage, or specimen claim. The outcome of the case could apply to a further 1,670 similar shareholder claims. It’s possible that claims covering incidents prior to 2012 may not be valid under the statute of limitations, the judge said on Monday. The case is expected to continue into next year and may end up before a higher court. ($1 = 0.8645 euros) Reporting by Jan C.

MSCI’s index of global equities inched 0.17 percent lower on the day as investors awaited action from U.S. President Donald Trump after the expiry of a deadline for public comment on additional tariffs on Chinese goods. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.13 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 18.22 points, or 0.07 percent, to 25,875.29, the S&P 500 gained 0.28 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,877.41 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.09 points, or 0.03 percent, to 7,922.07. “The fact that Trump still hasn’t announced the tariffs yet as expected has prompted a bit of cautious optimism, but it’s not a problem that’s going to go away,” said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson. Emerging markets remained under pressure, with the broad MSCI index of those countries currencies down near 16-month lows and the Indian rupee near a record trough against the U.S. dollar. An index of emerging market shares lost 0.93 percent. Copper, heavily consumed by emerging markets, lost 1.19 percent to $5,839.50 a tonne. Having warned last week that he was ready to slap additional taxes on practically all Chinese imports, Trump was uncharacteristically quiet on trade on Monday. China will respond if the United States takes any new steps on trade, the foreign ministry said on Monday, after Trump warned he was ready to slap tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports into the United States. Separately, it emerged China would ask the World Trade Organization next week for permission to impose sanctions on the United States for Washington’s non-compliance with a ruling in a dispute over U.S. dumping duties that China initiated in 2013, a meeting agenda showed on Tuesday. “Weakness is set to remain a recurring theme amid global trade tensions, a broadly stronger dollar and prospects of higher U.S. interest rates,” said Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst at broker FXTM. “With turmoil in Turkey and Argentina triggering contagion fears, appetite for emerging market assets and currencies is likely to continue diminishing.” Oil prices ignored the threat to demand posed by a trade war that could slow economic growth, instead taking its cue from looming U.S. sanctions against Iran’s petroleum industry that could hurt supply. U.S. crude rose 1.67 percent to $68.67 per barrel and Brent was last at $78.59, up 1.58 percent. Spot gold dropped 0.3 percent to $1,191.95 an ounce as the dollar resumed its ascent amid the risk-off sentiment and looming U.S. interest rate increases. The dollar index rose 0.11 percent. Bond markets, meanwhile, prepared to digest $144 billion in new supply from government auctions needed to finance U.S. deficit spending.

2018-09-11,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Google (GOOGL.O) said it has signed a 10-year deal to buy renewable energy from three new wind farms that are being built in Finland and which will power one of its data centres. Big companies have rushed to secure cheap renewable energy to manage costs and reduce their carbon footprint through so-called corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs), which allow firms such as Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, Facebook (FB.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) to buy directly from the energy generator. Google said on Tuesday that the Finnish deal is the first where it is buying power from European projects that will not receive any government subsidies. “In a growing number of locations, the cost of new renewable energy is competitive with the cost of power from the grid,” Marc Oman, Google’s head of EU energy, said in a blog. The combined capacity of the three farms will be 190 megawatts (MW) and will be built by renewable energy developers Neoen of France and Germany’s CPC and WPD. New wind power installations in Europe dropped by more than a quarter in the first half of 2018 to 4.5 gigawatt (GW), industry association WindEurope data shows, highlighting tighter competition as governments phase out industry support.     Wind has become competitive with conventional power in many  countries and large are managing volatile energy expenses by locking in electricity costs at a fixed price.  Last year, the number of new corporate PPAs, primarily wind and solar, reached a record with more than 5 gigawatt contracted, up almost a third from the 2016 level, the International Renewable Energy Agency said. Some European countries, most notably Germany and the Netherlands, have recently attracted zero-subsidy bids from wind project developers, putting intense pressure on turbine makers as the industry weans itself off government support.

Tata Power Solar, the renewable energy arm of Mumbai-headquartered Tata Power, is currently India’s biggest rooftop solar panel supplier. But with a market share of just 6 percent, it sees plenty of scope for growth and aims to leverage its position as an integrated solar power company - with a presence in manufacturing, engineering, construction and maintenance - to offer customers an end-to-end service. “We will give the benefit of low cost solar panels to our consumers and also help them (save money...) with other value-added services,” Praveer Sinha, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Tata Power, told Reuters. Ashish Khanna, CEO of Bangalore-headquartered Tata Power Solar, added the services would include consultancy, sourcing of solar panels, installation and maintenance of rooftop structures as well as low cost financing and liaising with distributors. He said the company would offer low cost financing through Tata group’s financing arm, Tata Capital. India has plans to install up to 175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity by 2022, out of which 40 GW is expected to come from rooftop solar panels. So far, however, the pace of rooftop installations has been just around 6 percent of the target, according to government figures. Tata Power Solar is also planning to launch a dealer network to better take on its myriad of competitors, which include Chinese companies. It plans to have 58 master dealers across nine states, with each having five third-party sales people under them, said a senior executive who did not want to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media.

2018-09-11,"(Updates with details, comment) LONDON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Toshiba’s NuGen has cut the team working on its British nuclear project, to fewer than 40 people from more than 100 as a sale of the project is taking longer than expected, NuGen said on Tuesday. The plant in Moorside, north-west England, was expected to provide around 7 percent of Britain’s electricity when built, but has faced several setbacks after Toshiba’s nuclear arm Westinghouse went bankrupt last year. Following the Westinghouse bankruptcy, NuGen joint venture partner Engie pulled out of the project, leaving the Japanese firm searching for new investors. Toshiba put NuGen up for sale and Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO) expressed interest, but the process has stalled. “For over a year, Toshiba has pursued a sale of NuGen to KEPCO. Due to the prolonged time it has taken reach a conclusion, NuGen has undertaken a review of its size and scale,” a spokesman for NuGen said in an emailed statement. NuGen said it remains committed to delivering the Moorside project and that the retained core team “will be focused on securing a sale of the NuGen business and supporting Toshiba’s activities.” Britain needs to invest in new capacity to replace ageing coal and nuclear reactors that are due to close in the 2020s, but large new plants have struggled to get off the ground due to high costs and weak electricity prices.

2018-09-11,"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 11 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Local authorities will carve out a larger role in fighting rising temperatures globally, as national governments have been slow to take action, said organizers of a climate change summit beginning on Wednesday in San Francisco. About 4,500 delegates from city and regional governments, as well as industries and research institutions, will attend the Global Climate Action Summit, which was put together by Californian authorities and the United Nations. The three-day gathering will deepen the leadership of sub-national authorities in curbing climate change, a battle that almost 200 nations have also joined under the Paris climate accord, according to organizers. “We’re moving into a new wave, a new phase of stepped up climate action,” said summit spokesman Nick Nuttall, adding that the event is expected to yield joint pledges to limit temperature increases. The gathering reflects a desire to bypass the slow progress of national governments in implementing Paris agreement goals, said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at New York’s Columbia University. The Paris pact aims to limit the rise in global temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), and ideally to 1.5 degrees Celsius, with a sweeping goal of ending the fossil fuel era this century. The agreement is due to come into force in 2020. But negotiations over how to roll out the treaty have exposed disagreements about funding for developing countries. This week’s summit in California is heavy with symbolism, as the United States is the only country to announce its intention to withdraw from the Paris pact, following a decision by U.S. President Donald Trump last year. “It can be and should be seen as a response to the abdication of leadership by the U.S. federal government, which has really created a vacuum for leadership,” Burger told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The gathering follows a summer marked by mounting signs of a rapidly warming atmosphere. Record heatwaves and wildfires this summer have been linked to above-normal temperatures worldwide. Local government administrators are expected to announce initiatives about electric vehicles and forest conservation, while companies will likely pledge to roll back greenhouse gas emissions, Nuttall said. National governments from more than a dozen countries, including China and Britain, are also sending representatives. China’s presence is to be particularly heavy, and it will have its own pavilion on the sidelines of the gathering. China is the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gasses, followed by the United States, according to the World Resources Institute, a Washington D.C.-based research organization. Chinese officials saw the meeting as a way to “make real progress” outside of political circles in Washington, said Daniel Sperling, a professor of environmental sciences at the University of California, Davis. “They like very much working with us in California because it’s below the radar: it’s not White House politics,” said Sperling, who is also a member of the California Air Resources Board, the state’s clean air regulator. California’s governor, Jerry Brown, defied the U.S. government’s retreat from the Paris pact by branding it “insane”, and immediately flying to China to foster greater cooperation on clean energy. The gathering, Brown said in a phone interview, was not designed to sway Trump’s opinion on climate change. But he said he hoped it would awaken other members of the Republican Party to the “existential threat” of global warming and to its economic potential, ahead of a U.S. mid-term general election to be held in November. “We are late, and we have to accelerate our efforts to reduce emissions,” he said. Policies encouraging bus transportation, green buildings and clean energy could generate 14 million jobs in cities globally by 2030, offsetting job losses in the energy industry, according to a report this week by C40, a network of large global cities.

2018-09-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil traders have become much more concerned in recent weeks about the potential impact of U.S. sanctions on Iran and the effect on the availability of crude at the end of the year. Brent futures for November have moved to a premium of 45 cents a barrel over the December contract, in a sharp reversal from early last month, when the earlier contract traded at a 20 cent discount. The gyrations in the futures curve are linked closely to traders’ perceptions of the availability of seaborne crude once sanctions are re-imposed from early November. (Chart: reut.rs/2CPnKUm) The November-December calendar spread moved into an increasing premium (backwardation) between July 2017 and May 2018, reflecting the overall tightening of the oil market. Rapid growth in consumption, output restraint by OPEC and its allies as well as unexpected disruptions to production in Venezuela and some African countries all helped to reduce excess oil inventories. The U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran’s exports from early November contributed to a forecast tightening of the market, pushing the Nov-Dec spread to a premium of more than 50 cents in early May. But the calendar spread subsequently collapsed as OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, and its non-OPEC allies, led by Russia, started to increase production from May onwards. For a short period, in late July and early August, the Nov-Dec spread was trading at a small but significant discount (contango) consistent with plentiful availability of oil at the end of the year. In recent weeks, however, the spread has tightened again, amid signs that output from the Permian Basin in Texas is levelling off and that Saudi Arabia is raising production more slowly than expected. Traders have become much more cautious about crude availability late this year, reflected in a rise in spot oil prices, tighter calendar spreads and an increase in bullish hedge fund positioning in crude futures. Concerns about crude availability have been exacerbated by signs that the threatened re-imposition of sanctions is already having an impact on Iran’s exports, even before the secondary embargo formally goes into effect. For the moment, traders are more concerned about a shortfall in crude availability as a result of sanctions and the stagnation of U.S. drilling than they are about a slowdown in the global economy hitting growth in oil consumption. THREE-WAY DANCE The sharp movements in the spread point to the complicated three-way dance between the White House, Saudi Arabia and hedge fund managers over Iran sanctions and oil supplies. The White House wants tough sanctions but is anxious to maintain crude availability and avoid being blamed for a rise in fuel costs, especially in an election year. Saudi Arabia supports a tough policy on Iran and has promised to make up any shortfall in oil supplies, but it does not want to risk oversupplying the market and provoking a renewed drop in prices. Hedge fund managers, in turn, are betting supplies will fall and prices rise as Saudi caution trumps White House pressure for steady or lower fuel costs. Someone must be miscalculating. If the market tightens as much as traders currently expect, the White House will be faced with a rise in prices it has tried hard to avoid. Rising prices may matter less after election day on Nov. 6, but they are likely to remain unwelcome at any time and will expose both the White House and Saudi Arabia to criticism for poorly executed policy. If, on the other hand, the White House and Saudi Arabia manage to keep the market plentifully supplied even as sanctions go into effect, Brent spot prices and calendar spreads are likely to come under renewed pressure. And hedge fund managers are likely to liquidate some of the new bullish positions they have established since late last month, intensifying downward pressure on spot prices and spreads. The oil market outlook now depends on whether the United States and Saudi Arabia can successfully implement their sanctions policy without disrupting global oil supplies. Most oil traders are betting they will fail and leave the market at least moderately short of crude. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own.

MSCI’s index of global equities inched lower on the day, after European shares joined Asian bourses in the red  as markets awaited action from U.S. President Donald Trump after the expiry of a deadline for public comment on additional tariffs on Chinese goods. European shares, having opened broadly higher, were down on the day, with a pan-European index of shares lower 0.3 percent. Hopes around a new Brexit deal kept the British pound near five-week highs however, helping lighten the mood a touch in Europe. The currency which rose 0.8 percent on Monday after the European Union’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said a Brexit deal was possible within weeks, hit a new five-week high of $1.3087. It slightly slipped off those levels as the trade worries returned to lift the dollar off the day’s lows. However, it was the second time in less than a week that Barnier signalled his desire to push ahead on Brexit negotiations, less than seven months before the United Kingdom is slated to leave the European Union on March 29, 2019. His comments have eased some of the anxiety that Britain would exit from the EU without any formal trading arrangement. “The Barnier headlines mean there’s a lower hurdle for getting a separation deal done by the end of the year, when the discussion about the future relationship can begin,” said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson. “Also, the fact that Trump still hasn’t announced the tariffs yet as expected has prompted a bit of cautious optimism, but it’s not a problem that’s going to go away,” he added. Meanwhile Italian bond yields - which move inversely to price - fell for the seventh straight day on Tuesday, making it the best run in over a year for the benchmark 10-year bond, as Italian politicians signalled that an upcoming budget would likely fall within European Union rules. The closely-watched Italy/Germany 10-year bond yield spread - seen as an indicator of euro zone sentiment - was at 231 basis points, as much as 60 bps tighter than last week’s peaks. Earlier in the session, Asian shares struggled to avoid a ninth straight session of losses as the spectre of a further escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade war haunted investors. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.05 percent, but held above lows last visited in July last year. Shanghai blue chips dipped 0.2 percent while South Korea fell 0.2 percent. Having warned last week that he was ready to levy additional taxes on practically all Chinese imports, U.S. President Donald Trump was uncharacteristically quiet on trade on Monday. China will respond if the United States takes any new steps on trade, the foreign ministry said on Monday, after President Donald Trump warned he was ready to slap tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports into the United States. Separately, it emerged China will ask the World Trade Organization next week for permission to impose sanctions on the United States for Washington’s non-compliance with a ruling in a dispute over U.S. dumping duties that China initiated in 2013, a meeting agenda showed on Tuesday. Emerging market currencies remained under pressure with a broad index down near 16-month lows and the Indian rupee near a record trough of 72.68 per dollar. “Weakness is set to remain a recurring theme amid global trade tensions, a broadly stronger dollar and prospects of higher U.S. interest rates,” said Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst at broker FXTM. “With turmoil in Turkey and Argentina triggering contagion fears, appetite for emerging market assets and currencies is likely to continue diminishing.” In commodity markets, gold was stuck at $1,195.80 an ounce and continues to move in the opposite direction to the dollar.

2018-09-11,"SINGAPORE/HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil exports to Japan and South Korea will rise to record highs this month as Asian refiners take advantage of the steep discounts American sellers are offering after losing Chinese customers amid the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing. Ship tracking data in Thomson Reuters Eikon showed that oil exports from the United States to South Korea in September will rise to a record average of at least 230,000 barrels per day (bpd). U.S. shipments to Japan will also rise to a record average of at least 134,000 bpd, the data showed. Two traders and a brokerage source said South Korean and Japanese refiners have been taking advantage of steep discounts of up to $10 per barrel between the U.S. crude benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) CLc1 that American producers base their crude sales on and the international Brent crude LCOc1 benchmark.  “They (South Koreans and Japanese refiners) need to find replacements for their drop in Iran imports and a fair amount of that is coming from the States. The steep discount of WTI to Brent is hard to resist,” said a Singapore-based ship broker. The sources declined to be named as they were not allowed to talk about commercial operations in public. “Our U.S. crude oil purchase is purely because of its price advantage,” said Kim Woo-kyung, a spokeswoman at SK Innovation (096770.KS), the owner of South Korea’s top refiner SK Energy. A spokesman for Japan’s biggest refiner JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy Corp (5020.T) said his firm had not received government orders to halt Iranian oil imports. He would not comment on commercial operations beyond saying “we will determine optimum crude in our own procurement plan.” Japan and South Korea were among the first major Iranian clients to bow to U.S. pressure and cut orders from Iran, the third-largest producer among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, with South Korea importing its last cargoes in July, the trade data showed. India, typically the second-biggest buyer of Iranian oil after China, has also dialed back Iranian orders while importing more from the United States, the data showed. Iran crude exports to Asia: tmsnrt.rs/2NDV3Os With Middle East crude markets tightening because of the start of U.S. sanctions against Iran in November, many Asian refiners have been seeking to make up the shortfall with American supply.  Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader said there has been “a divergence between Brent and WTI.” U.S. prices, including benchmark WTI, are under pressure amid rising production and a decline in Chinese buying interest because of the trade dispute which is forcing U.S. sellers to find new buyers for their crude. Meanwhile, the Brent benchmark is supported by several supply disruptions including the Iranian sanctions, tumbling exports from Venezuela, and lingering concerns about Libyan production amid clashes between internal groups. “There are still plenty of battles and other influences to disrupt Brent supply which has kept traders interested,” McKenna said, referring to concerns about supplies that tend to be priced off Brent, including from Libya, West Africa and the Middle East. Whether this price divergence will last is not clear. There are signs that Saudi Arabia and Russia will increase output to take up Iranian market share, which should ease Brent prices. Meanwhile, U.S. prices could rise because the surge in demand may exacerbate logistical bottlenecks since the current domestic pipeline, port and storage infrastructure is not geared to handle exports on this scale. This congestion is already causing offers to rise for U.S. supply for loading towards the end of the year, although no fixed deals have been reported, said a third trader in Singapore.

Clean-up operations continued after the magnitude 6.7 quake on Thursday, which left 44 people dead, knocked out power and damaged the only oil refinery on an island the size of Austria with a population of about 5.3 million. Power shortages are hampering efforts to clear debris and restart factories and the government is calling on residents and businesses to reduce their consumption by about 20 percent. Fully restarting Hokkaido Electric Power’s main power plant, the Tomato-Atsuma coal power station, will take more than a month, industry minister Hiroshige Seko told reporters. Previously he said it would take at least a week to restart. Supplies will be tight until Friday, when the 200-megawatt Kyogoku No.2 pumped hydro-electric power unit is expected to come back online, Seko said. Rolling blackouts may have to be imposed from Thursday if supplies are not enough to meet projected demand, he added. The power outage on Hokkaido was the worst to hit Japan since the aftermath of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami and has exposed flaws in Japan’s electricity grid. Supplies have been restored to almost all of Hokkaido’s 2.95 million power customers, Seko said. All three units have sustained damage at the Tomato-Atsuma power plant, which normally supplies about half the island’s electricity. The plant’s 350-megawatt (MW) No.1 unit is expected to start as early as the end of September, with the 600-MW No.2 unit not due back in operation until the middle of October at the earliest and the 700 MW No.4 unit only in November, Seko told reporters. To help ease tight supplies, Hokkaido Electric has moved forward plans for restarting the 200-MW Kyogoku No.1 pumped hydro unit to Sept. 21, its spokesman told Reuters. Idemitsu Kosan’s 150,000 barrels per day Hokkaido refinery sustained some damage to its refining facility from the quake and refining operations are still shut, the trade ministry said. An Idemitsu Kosan company spokesman in Tokyo said preliminary checks indicated no major damage to the refinery and the company was preparing to restart the facility. He could not say when operations would resume. Land product shipments of gasoline, kerosene and diesel from the refinery returned to normal on Tuesday, the company said.

Japan’s Nikkei fared better on the back of a softer yen and rallied 1 percent. Weighing on the yen was news Japanese chipmaker Renesas was buying U.S. peer Integrated Device Technology for about $6.7 billion in cash. Yet, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.34 percent to hit its lowest since July last year. Most bourses in the region nursed modest losses with Shanghai blue chips off 0.3 percent and South Korea 0.4 percent as investors awaited the next round of trade hostilities. Having warned last week that he was ready to levy additional taxes on practically all Chinese imports, U.S. President Donald Trump was uncharacteristically quiet on trade on Monday. China has cautioned it will respond if the United States takes any new steps on trade.

The Dow fell 0.23 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.19 percent and the Nasdaq 0.27 percent. In currency markets, sterling stood out after the European Union’s top negotiator said an agreement for Britain to leave the economic bloc might be reached in the coming weeks. The pound has been under pressure on anxiety that Britain would exit from the EU without any formal trading arrangement. Sterling clambered up to $1.3032, after firming 0.8 percent overnight. The euro held at $1.1586, hemmed between support at $1.1524 and resistance at $1.1659. It had been aided by an easing in concerns over Italian debt which left the gap between yields on Italian and more creditworthy German bonds at the narrowest in a month. Against a basket of major currencies the dollar was 0.1 percent firmer at 95.239. It gained on the yen to 111.40 , but remained within recent ranges. Emerging market currencies were under pressure with a broad index down near 16-month lows and the Indian rupee near a record trough of 72.675 per dollar, “Weakness is set to remain a recurring theme amid global trade tensions, a broadly stronger dollar and prospects of higher U.S. interest rates,” said Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst at broker FXTM. “With turmoil in Turkey and Argentina triggering contagion fears, appetite for emerging market assets and currencies is likely to continue diminishing.” In commodity markets, gold was stuck at $1,193.54 an ounce and continues to move in the opposite direction to the dollar. Oil prices found support from looming U.S. sanctions against Iran’s petroleum industry. Brent was 13 cents firmer at $77.50 a barrel, while U.S. crude inched up 4 cents to $67.58.

2018-09-11,"(Reuters) - U.S. shale oil producer SandRidge Energy Inc (SD.N) said on Monday it had ended its strategic review and rejected all bids, saying they undervalued the company. SandRidge Energy’ implied liquidation value, obtained by totaling the highest cash bids, amounted to about $12 to $13 per share, which “meaningfully undervalues” the company, it said in a statement. The company’s shares, which closed at $14.30 on Monday, gained 11 percent so far this year.  The company in June had announced it would review its operations, a month after activist investor Carl Icahn won a battle for control of the company, taking five seats on the board of the company that he wants to sell.  Sandridge’s board Chairman Jonathan Frates, who was nominated by Icahn in April, said the company would be open to a sale “at the right price.”  Earlier this year, the company said it had been approached by several potential bidders, shortly after Icahn forced the resignation of both its chief executive and chief financial officers. By the end of the three-month review process, SandRidge said it had executed 28 non-disclosure agreements and received eight offers to buy the company or certain assets.  The highest cash bids received for the company’s properties included $305 million for a combination of the Mississippian Lime and additional other Oklahoma properties, $70 million for the Northwest STACK properties and $100 million for the North Park Basin assets, which were “not consistent with the current proven reserves and expected cash flows of these properties” said SandRidge’s Chief Executive Officer, Bill Griffin. The company said it will continue to focus on cost reductions, margin improvements and divestment of non-core properties while moving forward with a profitable plan for organic growth.

2018-09-11,"* US sanctions to target Iran oil exports from November * Washington wants other producers replace falling Iran exports * Asian refiners buy American oil to make up for Iranian supply * US, Saudi & Russian oil production: tmsnrt.rs/2NtqGdd * Discount of US crude vs Brent: tmsnrt.rs/2CEdfTu By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Oil was steady on Tuesday, supported by looming U.S. sanctions against Iran’s petroleum industry. But prices were capped by signs that increased supplies by other major producers, including the United States and Saudi Arabia, could make up for the disruptions from Iran. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $67.61 per barrel at 0112 GMT, up 7 cents from their last settlement. Brent crude futures climbed 11 cents to $77.48 a barrel. “It was a mixed performance in the crude oil market,” said ANZ bank in a note, pointing to Washington’s sanctions against Iran’s oil exports that will be enforced from November. Washington is putting pressure on other countries to also cut Iran imports, with close allies like South Korea and Japan, but also India, showing signs of falling in line. ANZ bank said prices were capped “amid speculation later in the day that Saudi Arabia and Russia will fill any gap.” U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry met with Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih on Monday in Washington, the U.S. Energy Department said, as the Trump administration encourages big oil-producing countries to keep output high ahead of the renewed sanctions. Perry will also meet with Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak on Thursday in Moscow. Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia are the world’s three biggest oil producers by far, meeting around a third of the world’s almost 100 million barrels per day (bpd) of daily crude consumption. Combined output by these three producers has risen by 3.8 million bpd since Sept. 2014, more than the peak 3 million bpd Iran has managed during the last three years. With Middle East crude markets tightening because of the U.S. sanctions against Iran, many Asian refiners are seeking alternative supplies, with South Korean imports of U.S. crude likely hitting a record in November. At the same time, American oil producers are seeking new buyers for crude they used to sell to China before orders virtually dried up because of the trade disputes between Washington and Beijing. Traders said this pulled wide open the discount of U.S. WTI crude versus Brent to almost $10 per barrel, the biggest since June. LCO-CLFVMc1 Reporting by Henning Gloystein

2018-09-11,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The smog-prone northern Chinese province of Hebei met state air quality standards for the first time ever last month, official data showed, as it benefited from better weather, tough restrictions on polluters and slowing seasonal steel demand. Heavy-industrial Hebei, which surrounds the Chinese capital Beijing, has been on the front line of a state war on pollution. It has been under heavy pressure to cut transport emissions, curb coal consumption and impose tougher standards on polluting sectors like steel.      Average concentrations of small and hazardous airborne particles known as PM2.5 reached 31 micrograms per cubic meter over the whole of last month, down 22.5 percent from the same period last year, the provincial government said on its website on Monday. China’s interim standard for PM2.5 is 35 micrograms. The World Health Organization recommends concentrations of no more than 10 micrograms. Average PM2.5 over the first eight months stood at 54 micrograms, down 18.2 percent compared with a year earlier, the provincial government said. PM2.5 in Hebei averaged 65 micrograms last year. It aims to cut that to 55 micrograms by the end of 2020, and will eliminate or relocate more industrial capacity, convert boilers from coal to natural gas and take further action against diesel-fueled road freight in the next two years.
