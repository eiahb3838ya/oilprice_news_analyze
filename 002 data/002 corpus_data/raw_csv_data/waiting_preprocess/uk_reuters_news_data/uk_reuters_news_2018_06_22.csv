2018-06-22,"TUNIS, June 22 (Reuters) - Tunisia raised fuel prices on Friday by 4 percent, the third hike this year as the government seeks to a cut budget deficit, a key requirement of international lenders. The price of a litre of petrol will rise to 1.925 Tunisian dinars ($0.741) from 1.85 dinars, starting Saturday, the energy ministry said in a statement. The two previous increases this year were in March and January. The International Monetary Fund urged Tunisia this year to raise energy prices and the retirement age to help curb the budget deficit and said any further public wage hikes would be difficult to sustain given weak growth. Fuel subsidies this year will rise from an expected 1.5 billion dinars ($578 million) to 4 billion dinars with the rise of world oil prices, economic reforms minister Taoufik Rajhi said earlier this month. Tunisia has forecast that the budget deficit will fall to 4.9 percent of gross domestic product in 2018, from about 6 percent in 2017. Tunisia has dropped into a deep economic slump following the overthrow in 2011 of autocratic leader Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali. Although its successful democratic transition since then contrasts with other “Arab Spring” countries, nine governments have failed to cut the budget deficit and revive an economy hit by a lack of investment.

2018-06-22,"(Adds details about U.S. national security adviser John Bolton’s plan to visit Moscow next week) By Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON, June 22 (Reuters) - U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry will meet Russia’s energy minister next week in Washington, a person familiar with the situation said on Friday, as the two countries compete to supply global markets with natural gas and crude. Perry will meet Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak on Tuesday, in the context of the World Gas Conference that is being held in Washington, the source said. Meetings between top energy officials from Russia and the United States, two of the world’s largest oil and gas producers, have been rare in recent years. Relations between Moscow and Washington have cooled over Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and as the Trump administration blames the Russian government for cyber attacks that targeted the U.S. power grid over the last two years. The two countries are competing to sell natural gas to Europe. Russia’s Gazprom, the European Union’s biggest gas supplier, and several Western energy companies hope to open Nord Stream 2, a pipeline to bring Russian gas under the Baltic Sea to Germany. The United States, meanwhile, has begun some sales of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, to Poland and Lithuania, though LNG shipments can be more expensive than gas sent via pipeline. The United States says the advantage of its LNG is dependability and stable pricing. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump opposes the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, as did the administration of former President Barack Obama. Washington believes that the pipeline would give Russia, which has at times frozen deliveries to parts of Europe over pricing disputes, more power over the region. The meeting comes as U.S. national security adviser John Bolton plans to visit Moscow next week to prepare for a possible meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Perry and Novak will also likely talk about oil markets. On Friday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed in Vienna to raise oil output by a modest amount after consumers had called for producers to curb rising fuel prices. Russia, which is not an OPEC member, began cooperating last year with the group for the first time, holding back production to support global oil prices. Before the Vienna OPEC meeting, Novak said Moscow would propose a gradual increase in output from oil-producing countries, starting in July.

2018-06-22,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World shares rose on Friday but still registered their biggest weekly decline in three months on continuing global trade tensions, while oil prices surged after OPEC decided on only modest increases in crude production. U.S. Treasury yields were little changed as risk appetite improved a bit though investors remained cautious over a trade conflict with China. The euro rose on improved regional growth data and assurances by Italian politicians that Italy would not leave the single currency. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 1.18 percent. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.49 percent for the day, but for the week fell 1 percent in its biggest weekly drop in three months.  “The market’s saying we’re a little nervous about a trade war but we really don’t think there will be one,” Gail Dudack, chief investment strategist at Dudack Research Group, said. “Nothing major has happened today so the market is rebounding having discounted a lot of trade fears already.” On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 119.19 points, or 0.49 percent, to 24,580.89 snapping an eight-day losing streak.

U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 5.77 percent to $69.32 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $75.61, up 3.5 percent on the day. Investors grew more nervous this week about the possibility of a full-blown trade war due to increasingly sharp rhetoric between the United States and China, and growing evidence of the wider economic impact of the conflict. Chinese state media said on Friday that U.S. protectionism was self-defeating and a “symptom of paranoid delusions” that must not distract China. European carmakers’ shares fell sharply after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 20 percent tariff on all European Union-assembled cars imported into the United States, if EU “tariffs and trade barriers” are not removed. Trump’s threat, made in a tweet, followed the EU’s announcement that it would place duties on a range of U.S. products.

2018-06-22,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices soared on Friday after oil producers agreed to modest crude output increases to compensate for losses in production at a time of rising global demand. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other top crude producers, meeting in Vienna, agreed to raise output from July by about 1 million barrels per day (bpd).  The real increase, however, will be around 770,000 bpd, according to Iraq, because several countries that recently suffered production declines will struggle to reach full quotas, while other producers may not be able to fill the gap. The actual output increases set a bullish tone, as they came in below some of the highest figures that had been discussed prior to the meeting.   “There was a lot of anticipation in the market that there was going to be a lot of new oil coming to market, and that isn’t going to happen, at least for now,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital. “We were teased with an increase of about 1.8 million barrels (per day) at one point, and we ended up getting about 600,000,” Kilduff said. Brent crude LCOc1 settled up $2.50, or 3.4 percent, to $75.55 a barrel.  U.S. crude CLc1 rose $3.04, or 4.6 percent, to $68.58 a barrel, getting an additional boost after a surprise large drawdown at the storage hub at Cushing, Oklahoma.  Brent crude was up 2.7 percent on the week, while U.S. crude was up 5.5 percent. In post-settlement trading, both U.S. and Brent crude continued to strengthen. Brent rose $2.56 or 3.5 percent to $75.61, and U.S. crude traded $3.70, or 5.65 percent to $69.23 a barrel by 4:07 p.m. EDT [1807 GMT].  U.S. crude’s discount to Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1 narrowed by about 15 percent to $6.36 in the session, making it the smallest since May 11.  For about three weeks ahead of the OPEC meeting, prices had retreated from 3-1/2-year highs on fears that larger production increases could lead to oversupply.  Ultimately, Saudi Arabia persuaded Iran to cooperate with the plan to cut output, following calls from major consumers to curb rising fuel costs. OPEC’s decision confused some in the market as the producers gave opaque targets for the increase, making it difficult to understand precisely how much more it will pump. The expectation that the increase will fall short of the 1 million bpd figure boosted the market.  “The effective increase in output can easily be absorbed by the market,” Harry Tchilinguirian, head of oil strategy at French bank BNP Paribas, told the Reuters Global Oil Forum. “You think about 1 million bpd coming back online ... it’s not going to happen instantaneously, it’s going to take time,” said Brian LeRose, the senior technical analyst at ICAP. International marker, Brent, traded above $100 a barrel for several years until 2014, dropping to almost $26 in 2016 and then recovering to over $80 last month. The most recent price rally followed an OPEC decision to restrict supply in an effort to drain global inventories. The group started withholding supply in 2017 and this year, amid strong demand, the market tightened significantly, triggering calls by consumers for higher supply. Falling production in Venezuela and Libya, as well as the risk of lower output from Iran as a result of U.S. sanctions, have all increased market worries of a supply shortage. Front-month U.S. crude futures extended their rally during the session, trading as much as $1.51 a barrel above the second month contract CLc1-Clc2. That was the biggest premium since August 2014. The spread eased slightly to settle at about $1.00 a barrel.  A large decline in inventories at the storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma helped trigger the rally, traders said. Storage has fallen as Gulf Coast refiners have soaked up crude that was available at a discount, said Bob Yawger, director of Energy at Mizuho. The result is lower inventories at the hub for at least seven weeks, he said.  U.S. drillers cut the number of rigs drilling for oil by one to 862, the first cut in 12 weeks, according to a weekly report from GE’s Baker Hughes (BHGE.N) division. The rig count is a leading indicator of production <RIG/U>. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their bullish wagers on U.S. crude futures and options to the lowest in nearly eight months as crude fell 1.4 percent as U.S. production soared.

Trade worries still loomed, however, as U.S. President Donald Trump, in his latest move, threatened to impose a 20 percent tariff on all European Union car imports. The announcement came a month after the administration launched a probe into whether auto imports pose a threat to national security. Harley-Davidson fell 2.1 percent. The U.S. bike maker has in the past warned of a “significant impact” on its sales if the European Union decides to increase duties on motorcycles in retaliation.

2018-06-22,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) is reviewing whether to seek damages from former Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn, who was at the helm when it emerged the carmaker had cheated on emissions tests, supervisory board member Stephan Weil told a newspaper. “Damages against former management board members are under serious consideration, I’m not just saying that,” he told Sueddeutsche Zeitung in an interview when asked whether Volkswagen (VW) would seek damages from Winterkorn. “Once we know the outcome of investigations, we will make a decision,” said Weil, who represents the German state of Lower Saxony, a VW shareholder, on the company’s board. VW has for years said only lower-level managers knew of the emissions cheating, but U.S. authorities filed criminal charges against Winterkorn earlier this year. This month, Munich prosecutors widened their probe into VW’s premium brand Audi. They said they were investigating Audi Chief Executive Rupert Stadler for suspected fraud and false advertising and for his alleged role in helping to bring cars equipped with illegal software on to the European market.  This week they arrested Stadler, citing concerns he might try to interfere with the investigation. The arrest prompted the supervisory board to suspend him and name Bram Schot to take over as interim Audi CEO. Asked by Sueddeutsche why Stadler was suspended rather than removed entirely, Weil said many questions remained unanswered. “It is a matter of fairness to wait until the matter is cleared up. Any normal employer would do that,” he said, adding he could not predict whether Stadler would return to his post. Stadler remains remanded in custody but has not been charged with a crime. VW and Audi have said that Stadler should be presumed innocent unless proven otherwise.

2018-06-22,"VIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC agreed on Friday on a modest increase in oil production from next month after its leader Saudi Arabia persuaded arch-rival Iran to cooperate, following calls from major consumers to curb rising fuel costs.  But the agreement failed to announce a clear target for the output increase, leaving traders guessing how much more OPEC will actually pump. Oil prices LCOc1 rose by $1.85 to $74.90 a barrel. U.S. President Donald Trump was among those wondering how much more oil OPEC will deliver. “Hope OPEC will increase output substantially. Need to keep prices down!” Trump wrote on Twitter after OPEC announced its decision. The United States, China and India had urged oil producers to release more supply to prevent an oil deficit that could undermine global economic growth.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said in a statement that it would raise supply by returning to 100 percent compliance with previously agreed output cuts, but gave no concrete figures.  Saudi Arabia said the move would translate into a nominal output rise of around 1 million barrels per day (bpd), or 1 percent of global supply. Iraq said the real increase would be around 770,000 bpd because several countries that had suffered production declines would struggle to reach full quotas.  By avoiding setting individual country targets, the deal appears to give Saudi Arabia the leeway to produce more than its official OPEC target and fill the gap left by those like Venezuela who cannot pump enough to meet their official allocation. Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, had demanded OPEC reject calls from Trump for an increase in oil supply, arguing that he had contributed to a recent rise in prices by imposing sanctions on Iran and fellow member Venezuela. Trump slapped fresh sanctions on Tehran in May and market watchers expect Iran’s output to drop by a third by the end of 2018. That means the country has little to gain from a deal to raise OPEC output, unlike top oil exporter Saudi Arabia. However, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih convinced his Iranian peer Bijan Zanganeh to support the increase just hours before Friday’s OPEC meeting. OPEC and its allies have since last year been participating in a pact to cut output by 1.8 million bpd. The measure had helped rebalance the market in the past 18 months and lifted oil LCOc1 to around $75 per barrel from as low as $27 in 2016. But unexpected outages in Venezuela, Libya and Angola have effectively brought supply cuts to around 2.8 million bpd in recent months.  The output boost agreed on Friday had been largely priced into the market and was seen as modest. “It will be enough for now but not enough for the fourth quarter to address a decline in Iranian and Venezuelan exports,” said Gary Ross, head of global oil analytics at S&P Global. “There isn’t a lot of spare capacity in the world. If we lose a million bpd of output from Venezuela and Iran in the fourth quarter, where will all these barrels come from? We are in for higher prices for longer,” he said. Falih has warned the world could face a supply deficit of up to 1.8 million bpd in the second half of 2018 and that OPEC’s responsibility was to address consumers’ worries. “We want to prevent the shortage and the squeeze that we saw in 2007-2008,” Falih said, referring to a time when oil rallied close to $150 per barrel. OPEC’s deal to release more supply centres on returning to 100 percent compliance with existing, agreed cuts. Current compliance is around 40-50 percent above target because of production outages in Venezuela, Libya and Angola. “As a group we can meet the 100 percent compliance. As individual countries, it is challenging,” said United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui. Zanganeh has said that if OPEC returned to regular compliance, the group would raise output by around 460,000 bpd. Iran has objected to having members with additional capacity such as Saudi Arabia fill Venezuelan output gaps.  “Both Saudi and Iran can show that they won,” an OPEC delegate said.  “Zanganeh can go back to his country and say ‘I won’, because we are keeping the original agreement unchanged. Falih can go back and say ‘we will be able to raise production to meet market needs’.” OPEC and non-OPEC producers will meet on Saturday to iron out details of the pact and then again in September to review the deal. The next formal OPEC meeting was set for Dec. 3.

2018-06-22,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The largest U.S. oil and gas lobby group is seeking to convince Hispanic and black communities to support the Trump administration’s proposed expansion of offshore drilling, arguing it would create high paying jobs, including for storm-displaced Puerto Ricans. The American Petroleum Institute (API) launched its “Explore Offshore” campaign earlier this month to counter offshore drilling foes in coastal southeast states from Virginia to Florida, where lawmakers and governors on both sides of the aisle have expressed fear an oil spill could ruin tourism. “We want to build support in minority communities because the message that increasing the supply of affordable energy and good paying jobs will resonate,” said Erik Milito, API’s director of Upstream and Industry Operations. As part of the campaign, API has partnered with a number of black and Hispanic business groups, including the Virginia, Florida and North Carolina Hispanic Chambers of Commerce and  the Florida Black Chamber of Commerce and South Carolina African American Chamber of Commerce. A Pew Research poll published in January showed that 56 percent of Hispanics and 54 percent of blacks opposed offshore drilling, compared to 48 percent of white people. The Interior Department in January announced a proposal to open up nearly all U.S. offshore waters to drilling, triggering a backlash from coastal states that rely on tourism. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told a Senate panel in April that he is likely to scale back the proposal following meetings with coastal governors. Shortly after he unveiled his offshore drilling proposal, Zinke offered an exemption for Florida after he held a private meeting with Republican Governor Rick Scott. The oil and gas industry is keen to pursue seismic testing in areas they believe hold the largest reserves along the southern Atlantic coast and to Florida’s eastern Gulf shorelines. The API campaign published op-eds in local newspapers this week, including one by Stephen Gilchrist, chair of South Carolina’s African American Chamber of Commerce. In it he touts API’s major talking point that oil and gas exploration jobs offer locals an average salary of $116,000 without requiring a college degree. “It’s a myth that communities of color are not interested in supporting offshore exploration,” he wrote in South Carolina’s Post and Courier. “I’ve personally attended town hall meetings up and down South Carolina’s coast where there has been significant support for the economic opportunity offshore exploration holds - especially in communities that have been historically disenfranchised.” API, however, acknowledged it needs to hold community meetings and improve local outreach to sway minority communities that have been inclined to oppose offshore drilling. Miriam Ramirez, a co-chair of the API’s Florida campaign and a former Puerto Rico state senator said she thinks the lure of higher-paying jobs, especially for victims of 2017’s Hurricane Maria, would create economic opportunities that outweigh environmental concerns.  “We have an influx of thousands of Puerto Ricans in Florida, including doctors and engineers who plan to relocate permanently,” Ramirez said.  A study released in March by Oceana, an Ocean conservancy group, found Interior’s offshore drilling plan would put more than 2.6 million jobs and nearly $180 billion in gross domestic product at risk for only two year’s-worth of oil and just over one year’s-worth of gas at current consumption. “Jobs that come from offshore drilling do not guarantee local good paying jobs compared to the tourism industry, which can keep jobs local,” said Pricey Harrison, a North Carolina state representative and president of the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators.  Julio Fuentes, president of Florida’s Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said he is reaching out to new Puerto Rican evacuees, as well as existing local communities that are skeptical of offshore drilling, by hosting roundtables with business leaders and community organizations. “I always like to talk about the safety aspect of it,” Fuentes said. “Since the BP oil spill, there have been over 100 new industry standards put in place,” he said, referring to the devastating Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 that caused tremendous damage to beaches and coastlines in Gulf coast states. But environmental justice advocates counter that there is no way to guarantee safe offshore drilling. Marce Gutierrez-Graudins, president of conservation group Azul, said it takes only one spill or accident to deprive lower-income Hispanic communities access to the shore, which she argues is an important form of escape from the stress of urban areas where many minorities live.

2018-06-22,"(Adds rig count in the Permian basin) June 22 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies this week cut one oil rig, the first reduction in 12 weeks, after drillers started to slow down the rate of additions this month as pipeline constraints put a damper on future production. The total oil rig count dipped to 862 in the week to June 22, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI That put the rig count on track for its smallest monthly gain since declining by two rigs in March with just three rigs added so far in June. As pipelines out of the Permian basin in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, largest U.S. oil field, reach capacity in the coming months, smaller producers will have to slow or shut-in production, according to oil executives. Active units in the Permian, where more than half of the country’s oil rigs are located, declined by two this week to 473, their lowest level in five weeks. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is much higher than a year ago when 758 rigs were active as energy companies have been ramping up production in tandem with OPEC’s past efforts to cut global output in a bid to take advantage of rising prices. On Friday, U.S. crude futures jumped by the most since November 2016 to around $68 per barrel, their highest for the month of June, after OPEC and its allies led by Russia agreed to increase production by about 1 million barrels per day (bpd). So far this year, U.S. oil futures have averaged $65.19 per barrel. That compares with averages of $50.85 in 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading near $67 for the balance of 2018 and $63 for calendar 2019. In anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than 2017, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies they track have provided guidance indicating a 13 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said those E&Ps expect to spend a total of $81.2 billion in 2018, up from an estimated $72.1 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast average total oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,038 in 2018, 1,097 in 2019 and 1,232 in 2020, the same as last week. Since 1,052 oil and gas rigs were currently in service, drillers would only have to add a handful of rigs for the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. So far this year, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,001.

2018-06-22,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The wind and solar industries hope demand for carbon-free power from U.S. cities, states and corporations can offset headwinds from President Donald Trump’s tax policy and tariffs, developers said this week.  The Trump tax overhaul trimmed production and investment tax credits, and the administration also slapped a 30 percent tariff on imported solar panels. The moves, aimed at boosting manufacturing and economic growth, also dimmed prospects for renewables. But Trump’s withdrawal of federal support for Obama-era climate goals indirectly helped the industry by inspiring a backlash among U.S. cities, states and corporations, which have grown more ambitious about installing cleaner forms of energy.  Also, investors with years of deals under their belts are less wary about financing solar and wind than they were years ago, and socially responsible funds are actively seeking projects to invest in, according to executives and investors at the Renewable Energy Finance Forum-Wall Street in New York. Gregory Wetstone, president and chief executive officer of the American Council on Renewable Energy, noted that two big solar projects worth about $2.5 billion total have been canceled or stalled since the tariffs were announced in January. The Solar Energy Industries Association has said the tariffs would result in the loss of 23,000 U.S. jobs. But some manufacturers and developers have announced new projects in the face of the tariffs. Wetstone noted that solar led all generation sources with 2.5 gigawatts of new capacity in the first quarter of 2018. “There is a sea change in grass-roots demand for renewable energy,” Susan Nickey, managing director at Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure Capital Inc (HASI.N), which invests about $1 billion a year in the sector, said in an interview on the sidelines of the conference on Tuesday.  “More and more corporations and consumers are saying ‘We want 100 percent renewable energy,’” she said, adding city and state governments are adopting renewable-friendly policies to reflect that growing demand. She cited a survey of financial institutions that showed two-thirds of respondents planned to boost renewable investments this year. Some 89 percent said they would sharply increase planned investments from now to 2030 unless government policies slow demand for renewable energy. (bit.ly/2lsBoRI) Craig Cornelius, president of NRG Energy Inc’s (NRG.N) NRG Renewables, told a panel at the conference that while Trump’s tax bill was initially worrying, “it has been ultimately easier to work through the repercussions than we anticipated.”  As the bill moved through Congress, Republican lawmakers from states with renewable projects joined Democrats to make changes. The final version kept 80 percent of the investment tax credit and production tax credit values, and dropped a proposed corporate alternative minimum tax that would have made the tax credits less valuable. “Members on both sides of the aisle stepped out to support us,” Laura Beane, president and chief executive officer of Avangrid Renewables, said on Wednesday. Avangrid is developing the 800-megawatt Vineyard Wind project off the coast of Massachusetts. Quick action helped many developers dodge harm from U.S. tariffs on solar cells, noted Stacey Kusters, president of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Co’s [MEHC.UL] BHE Solar.  “A lot of the projects that were planned went in and bought two years’ worth of panels” before the tariffs, she said.  Meanwhile, the industry is bracing for the scheduled reduction and ultimate expiry of lucrative subsidies on solar and wind power over the coming years, including a 30 percent tax credit on solar installations. This will make it trickier to finance some renewable projects, said Robert Sternthal, managing director at Rubicon Capital Advisors, who is putting together a team of bankers to advise on renewable deals in North America. Without the incentives, “pricing may have to go up on the electricity side” for some projects, he said on Tuesday. Yet he also expects growing demand from tech corporations that have pledged to be carbon-neutral and will not rely on wind or solar energy for profits.  “Google, Facebook and Apple don’t have to make 6 to 7 percent returns on these assets,” he said. Improvements in technology could help make wind and solar more competitive “in terms of cost and sustainability” after tax credits expire, said Rafael Gonzalez, president and chief executive officer of Enel Green Power North America, whose projects include wind, solar, geothermal, and hydropower.  Beane said Avangrid Renewables is betting on prospects for “a lot of demand for offshore wind power in the U.S. Northeast.” The company starts construction on the Vineyard Wind project next year, and it is slated to come online in 2021.  By then, she said, the project may be competitive on its own thanks to improved technology and expertise: “You’ll be very surprised at the prices.”  Reporting by Dave Gregorio in New York Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Matthew Lewis",https://uk.reuters.com/article/renewables-energy-trump/renewable-energy-seeks-demand-investment-to-survive-trump-squeeze-idUKL8N1TM6GP,22 Jun 2018,"The wind and solar industries

2018-06-22,"(Adds quote, background) MOSCOW, June 22 (Reuters) - South Korea’s state-run Korea Gas Corp may join Russia’s Arctic LNG-2 project, President Vladimir Putin said on Friday after talks with South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in in Moscow. Russian energy company Novatek and KOGAS signed an agreement on liquefied natural gas (LNG) cooperation and said they had decided to increase Russian gas deliveries to South Korea. Novatek said in a statement the companies “agreed to explore opportunities for KOGAS to enter the Arctic LNG 2 project and possible LNG off-take from the project”. The agreement shows the Kremlin’s ability to find foreign partners despite Western sanctions. French energy major Total agreed to buy a 10 percent stake in the Arctic gas project under a deal struck during Emmanuel Macron’s visit to Russia last month. LNG production itself in Russia is not subject to sanctions, but Russian companies’ ability to raise financing is constrained by the punitive measures introduced for Moscow’s role in the Ukrainian conflict and alleged meddling in U.S. elections. Russia plans to double its share of the global LNG market from about 4 percent now by 2020. Qatar is the biggest LNG exporter, with a 30 percent market share.

U.S. Treasury yields edged higher, trading in narrow ranges as risk appetite improved a bit but worries over a trade conflict with China kept investors cautious. The euro rose on Friday as traders were encouraged by an improvement in regional growth data and assurance by Italian politicians that their nation would not leave the economic bloc. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 1.14 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.56 percent. But the global index registered its biggest weekly drop for three months. “It’s not like stocks are getting a major bounce. It’s a little stop of the bleeding. We’re taking our breath and focusing on the oil market,” said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. “Oil is the bigger story today with the OPEC news,” he said. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 170.44 points, or 0.7 percent, to 24,632.14, the S&P 500 gained 11.96 points, or 0.43 percent, to 2,761.72 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 9.35 points, or 0.12 percent, to 7,703.60. The energy sector was the benchmark S&P 500 index’s biggest percentage gainer as oil prices rose sharply after OPEC agreed to only a modest increase in output to compensate for losses in production at a time of rising global demand. U.S. crude rose 4.12 percent to $68.24 per barrel and Brent was last at $74.69, up 2.25 percent on the day. “The effective increase in output can easily be absorbed by the market,” Harry Tchilinguirian, head of oil strategy at French bank BNP Paribas, told the Reuters Global Oil Forum. However, investor nervousness over a possible full-blown trade war deepened this week over increasingly sharp rhetoric between the United States and China, and growing evidence of the wider economic impact of this conflict. Chinese state media said on Friday that U.S. protectionism was self-defeating and a “symptom of paranoid delusions” that must not distract China from its path to modernisation. European and U.S. car makers’ shares fell sharply after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 20 percent tariff on all European Union-assembled cars coming into the United States, if EU “tariffs and trade barriers” are not removed.. The euro rose after IHS Markit data showed business activity in Germany and France, the euro zone’s top two economies, picked up in June despite U.S.-Europe trade tensions. The dollar index, tracking it against six major currencies, fell 0.04 percent, with the euro up 0.26 percent to $1.1631. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.03 percent versus the greenback at 109.99 per dollar. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 4/32 in price to yield 2.9096 percent, from 2.897 percent late on Thursday.

To the extent they get the blame for higher prices, it’s not welcome news for their customers, especially those who have signaled they will continue buying from them despite U.S. sanctions.” “OPEC has once again under-delivered. The impact should be price positive. All they agreed to was to get back to 100 percent compliance at the group level i.e. 1.2 million bpd less than October 2016 production levels. That barely moves the mark on aggregate OPEC levels of production. Oil markets should remain tight as a result. They were very elusive on actual figures and seem to have abandoned individual country targets. No information on who will make up for the shortfall was announced. Markets were expecting larger production increases. Prices should rise as a result.” “The real rise in supply for OPEC and non-OPEC will probably be around 700,000-750,000 bpd (barrels per day). It will be enough for now but not enough for Q4 to address a decline in Iranian and Venezuelan exports. Plus there isn’t a lot of spare capacity in the world. If we lose a million bpd of output from Venezuela and Iran in Q4 where will all these barrels come from? We are in for higher prices for longer.” HARRY TCHILINGUIRIAN, HEAD OF COMMODITIES STRATEGY, BNP PARIBAS “The effective increase in output can easily be absorbed by the market and is not going to tip the oil balance into negative territory. So I suspect the market will continue to grind higher, notably in view of oil inventories in the OECD being below the famous five-year average target and the ever present risk of supply outages in Venezuela and Libya. And eventually, there will be some shuttering of supply in Iran as U.S. start having a negative impact on the country’s exports.” “In the short term we are likely to see crude oil being supported by continued geo-political risks related to supply concerns from Venezuela and not least Iran as the deadline for the implementation of U.S. sanctions approaches. These concerns may, however, eventually be replaced by a shifting focus towards a continued rise in non-OPEC supply and not least demand growth, which may begin to suffer due to a slowdown among emerging market economies.” “OPEC was likely to agree to raise output but the increase is slightly more than we assumed. Based on our previously published balance, we expect OPEC crude output to increase by about 700,000 bpd by the end of the year, assuming Libya’s oil output can rebound to 900,000 bpd. This agreement is consistent with those expectations, though we see a slight upside risk in Saudi, UAE, and Kuwaiti output expectations compared with our balance.” “Going into the real OPEC meeting today (followed by OPEC+ tomorrow), the recommendation to the members after longer than expected discussions and debates yesterday is for a formal increase of +1.0 million bpd to be split with some pro-rata calculations which will result in a real increase anywhere between 500-700,000 bpd.

2018-06-22,"* Rupee mechanism was in place under previous U.S. sanctions * Some Indian firms already reducing Iran oil imports * Rupee system may narrow Indian trade deficit with Iran (Adds details) By Nidhi Verma and Neha Dasgupta NEW DELHI, June 22 (Reuters) - India is looking to revive a rupee trade mechanism to settle part of its oil payments to Iran, fearing foreign channels to pay Tehran might choke under pressure from U.S. sanctions, two government sources said. During a previous round of sanctions, India devised a barter-like scheme acceptable to Washington to allow it to make some oil payments to Tehran in rupees through a small state bank. Iran used the funds to import goods from India. “We are looking at reviving rupee mechanism ... we have to prepare ourselves,” one of the sources told Reuters, adding that the current payment mechanism might not work from November. A commerce ministry official said India’s central bank had yet to decide on moving back to the rupee payment mechanism. In May, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran and ordered the reimposition of U.S. sanctions. Some U.S. sanctions take effect from Aug. 6 while those, notably affecting the oil sector, will be effective from Nov. 4. Refiners in India currently use State Bank of India and Germany-based Europaeisch-Iranische Handelsbank AG (EIH) to buy Iranian oil in euros, according to IOC and other companies. SBI, India’s top banker, has written to the Indian refiners and the government to say it would not be able to handle oil payments to Iran from Nov 4, an official at SBI said. India refiners receive a 60-day credit period for payments to Iran, suggesting oil imports from Iran could be hit from August. The Indian government has not asked its refiners to cut Iranian oil imports, but some firms have started reducing purchases from Tehran. “So far we don’t know what we are expected to do. We have not asked refiners to cut imports,” the source said, adding an official meeting between India and the United States to discuss Iran sanctions had not yet taken place. An Indian delegation visited officials and bankers in France, Germany, Britain and Brussels, the base for the European Union, to find alternative payment routes, the source said, adding it had found it would be “almost impossible to use European banks for payment to Iran.” Restarting the rupee payment mechanism would help fix a trade balance tilted in favour of Iran. India’s trade deficit with Iran narrowed from $11.4 billion in the financial year 2011/12 to about $3.6 billion in 2015/16, when the previous rupee payment mechanism was in place. Since then, it widened to about $8.5 billion in 2017/18, commerce ministry figures show.

2018-06-22,"* Lenzing and Duratex to form 51:49 joint venture * Ramp-up of the plant expected for 2022 * Lenzing expects significant impact on earnings * Lenzing, Duratex shares jump By Kirsti Knolle VIENNA, June 22 (Reuters) - Austrian cellulose fibres producer Lenzing and Brazilian wood panels maker Duratex plan to build a $1 billion dissolving wood pulp plant in Brazil, the companies said. Lenzing specialises in fibres made from wood and pulp, meeting increasing demand from the fashion industry for alternative textiles to cotton. It will hold 51 percent in a venture with Duratex that will operate the mill in the state of Minas Gerais, close to Sao Paulo, it said. The decision for the new Brazilian plant is in line with Lenzing’s strategy of expanding its international footprint and moving its cost base closer to where it makes revenues, Chief Executive Stefan Doboczky said in an investor call on Friday. “We make a substantial contribution to the strategic goals of Lenzing, not only growing the company but also growing its EBITDA (core earnings).” In 2017, Lenzing posted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 503 million euros ($587 million). Duratex, which will bring its forest assets to the joint venture, expects the project to reduce its exposure to the domestic market and civil construction, it said in a presentation on its website. The Brazilian group reported revenues of 4 billion Brazilian Real ($1.1 billion) in 2017. Both companies’ investors welcomed the news, with Duratex shares jumping as much as 9 percent and Lenzing’s as much as 5.2 percent. “We continue to believe that the market is not giving Lenzing’s unique innovation drive and leadership position in man-made specialty fiber the value it deserves and see the company ... as strongly undervalued,” said Baader Helvea analyst Laura Lopez Pineda in a note to clients. All conceptual work for the 450,000 tons dissolving wood pulp (DWP) plant has been done and approval processes are about to start, said Doboczky. The final investment decision for the largest single line DWP plant in the world is expected in the second half next year, with ramp-up in 2022, he said. An area of 43,000 hectares in Brazil’s Triângulo Mineiro region will provide biomass for production, according to Duratex. The investment of “somewhat above $1 billion” will be divided according to the joint venture split, the Austrian group’s CEO said. About 60 percent is planned to be financed by debt and 40 percent by equity, said Lenzing finance chief Thomas Obendrauf. ($1 = 0.8576 euros) $1 = 3.7633 reais

2018-06-22,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Venezuelan security forces suspected of killing hundreds of demonstrators and alleged criminals enjoy immunity from prosecution, indicating that the rule of law is “virtually absent” in the country, the United Nations said on Friday. The U.N. human rights office called on the government to bring perpetrators to justice and said it was sending its  report to the International Criminal Court (ICC), whose prosecutor opened a preliminary investigation in February.  The U.N. report cited “credible, shocking” accounts of extrajudicial killings of young men during crime-fighting operations in poor neighbourhoods conducted without arrest warrants. Security forces would tamper with the scene so that there appeared to have been an exchange of fire, it said. There was no immediate response from the government of President Nicolas Maduro to the report. Critics say Maduro has used increasingly authoritarian tactics as the OPEC nation’s economy has spiralled deeper into recession and hyperinflation, fuelling discontent and prompting hundreds of thousands to emigrate in the past year.  About 125 people died in anti-government protests last year. Security forces were allegedly responsible for killing at least 46 of them, U.N. rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told a news briefing, adding: “Evidence has reportedly disappeared from case files.” Maduro says the opposition protests were aimed at overthrowing him and accuses the United States of directing an “economic war” against Venezuela. “The failure to hold security forces accountable for such serious human rights violations suggests that the rule of law is virtually absent in Venezuela,” said Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. “The impunity must end.” Zeid called on the U.N. Human Rights Council on Monday to set up an international commission of inquiry into alleged violations in Venezuela — one of its 47 member states.  “The time has come for the Council to use its voice to speak out before this tragic downward spiral becomes irreversible,” Leila Swan of Human Rights Watch said in a statement on Friday. The unpopular Maduro has cast the release of dozens of opposition members as a peace gesture following his re-election to a new six-year term last month, which was condemned by most Western nations as an undemocratic farce. His government denies the detainees are political prisoners.  Venezuela is suffering from an economic collapse that includes chronic shortages of food and medicine and annualised inflation around 25,000 percent. Maduro blames an “economic war” directed by the opposition and the United States — which has imposed new sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry. Under previous attorney-general Luisa Ortega Diaz, who fled Venezuela last year, 357 security officers were believed to be under investigation for crime-related killings, but there has been no public information since then, the report said.

2018-06-22,"OSLO (Reuters) - Britain’s exit from the European Union could leave companies planning to build more power interconnections at the mercy of possible new trading arrangements and potential tariffs, Norway’s state-owned grid operator Statnett [STASF.UL] said. Statnett and Britain’s National Grid (NG.L) agreed before the Brexit vote to construct the first interconnector between the two countries by 2021. A separate consortium of Norwegian energy companies and Sweden’s Vattenfall [VATN.UL] is seeking to build a second cable by 2022-2023 for about 2 billion euros (1.8 billion pounds). Brexit could mean that new trading arrangements may be required to sell power via the interconnectors as Britain might not be allowed to participate in the European spot and intra-day power trading market, according to the Norwegian grid. “In that case, the UK will be treated in the same way as Switzerland,” Statnett told Norway’s NVE power regulator in a letter reviewed by Reuters. Brexit could also mean that Britain will no longer be bound by EU competition rules, which currently allow interconnectors to seek British subsidy payments for providing supply capacity. “There is therefore a risk that British authorities exclude international connections from participation in the capacity market or significantly reduce the value of participation,” Statnett said. “We would also like to point out that there is a risk that British authorities may introduce a border tariff,” it added.  NorthConnect has been at the centre of a political row in Norway, with left-wing opposition parties and some trade unions opposing the second cable over fears of rising power prices. Statnett also said that plans to build NorthConnect by 2022 were unrealistic given the time needed to manufacture and install the cable.  Odd Oeygarden, chairman of the NorthConnect owners’ group, said Brexit made the situation unclear to some extent, but pointed out that Statnett was already building a cable and that there are more links from the European mainland in place. “I think in the long run the UK and the EU will find the solutions that would allow the interconnectors to operate,” he said.

2018-06-22,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * MSCI All Country World index set for worst week in 3 months * Strong services PMIs lift European shares * Euro climbs half a percent * Greek bond yields fall to 4-week lows after debt relief By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, June 22 (Reuters) - World shares rose on Friday but were set to end in the red for a second week running amid intensifying worries over the fallout of a trade dispute resulting from U.S. tariffs, while oil prices rose with an OPEC meeting underway. The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks stocks in 47 countries, was up 0.3 percent by afternoon in Europe but down 1.3 percent on the week, its worst weekly performance since the week ended March 23. Futures indicated a recovery on Wall Street after a sharp drawdown the previous day. Investor nervousness over a possible full-blown trade war has deepened this week over increasingly sharp rhetoric between the United States and China, and growing evidence of the economic damage such a conflict could produce. Chinese state media said on Friday that U.S. protectionism was self-defeating and a “symptom of paranoid delusions” that must not distract China from its path to modernisation. Earlier this week, German carmaker Daimler cut its earnings forecast, saying tariffs on cars exported from the United States to China would hurt Mercedes-Benz sales. India joined the European Union and China in retaliating against U.S. President Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminium, raising import duties on U.S. almonds by 20 percent. “With no negotiations in sight at the moment, our base case (scenario) is shifting to a further escalation of the trade conflict between the two countries,” wrote analysts at Danske Bank in a note to clients. There is a risk of a further deterioration in relations on June 30, when Washington is due to announce a plan to restrict Chinese investments into the United States and limit exports of U.S. tech products to China, they added. Strong financial stocks and better-than-expected euro zone purchasing managers index for services helped drive a timid relief bounce in European shares. But the pan-European STOXX 600 and its euro zone counterpart were set for their biggest weekly loss in three months as the consequences of rising protectionism sank in, notably for the autos sector. The strong PMIs also boosted the euro. It was last up 0.4 on the day and was set to end the week higher by half a percent. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was 0.2 percent lower. Against the yen, the greenback gained 0.2 percent. It was modestly higher at 110.16 yen, below a one-week high of 110.76 scaled the previous day amid lingering concerns over the U.S.-China trade dispute. “The potential for all-out trade war, European political risks and emerging market volatility remain potent factors that should contain dollar/yen within the current range, though the lack of downside over the last week or so suggests stronger underlying demand,” wrote Robert Rennie, head of market strategy at Westpac. The European PMIs also showed manufacturing growth was the weakest in 18 months on trade worries. Elsewhere in Europe, Greece’s borrowing costs fell to four-week lows on Friday after Athens won debt relief from the euro zone. Italian bond yields also fell after a top lawmaker said an exit from the euro was not part of the current government’s plans. Sterling was 0.3 percent higher against the dollar, extending gains made the previous day after the Bank of England’s chief economist Andy Haldane unexpectedly joined the minority of policymakers calling for a UK interest rate hike, citing concerns about growing wage pressure. OPEC agreed on Friday to raise oil production by around 1 million barrels per day from July for the group and its allies, an OPEC source said, although crude prices remained higher on the day. Brent crude was trading at $74.44 a barrel, up almost 2 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 1.5 percent to $66.52 per barrel. Earlier in Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped as much as 0.35 percent at one point to touch its weakest since early December, before erasing losses to be up 0.15 percent. Still it was 2.3 percent off for the week. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng plumbed six-month lows, having lost 3.9 percent so far this week. South Korea’s KOSPI hit nine-month lows and in mainland China, the CSI300 index lost almost 5 percent this week to one-year lows. Japan’s Nikkei gave up 0.8 percent for a weekly loss of 1.7 percent.

2018-06-22,"(Adds details) By Duncan Miriri NAIROBI, June 22 (Reuters) - Kenya Airways will resume aviation fuel hedging in the second half of this year after price volatility drove up its costs, the airline’s CEO said on Friday. The carrier, which is 7.8 percent owned by Air France KLM , suspended fuel hedging in 2016 after contract losses sent it deeper into the red following a prolonged business slump and a jump in finance costs. Chief Executive Officer Sebastian Mikosz said the recent increase in the price of Brent crude had driven up fuel costs - a quarter of its total costs - forcing a rethink on hedging. “The volatility of the fuel price has been really tremendous... Addressing this is our utmost concern,” he told a news conference after the company’s annual meeting. Kenya Airways suspended hedging at a time when it was struggling to cope with a sharp drop in air travel to Kenya due to militant attacks and concerns about an Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The airline has since restructured $2 billion of debt and Mikosz said now was the time for “a very lean, mean, conservative policy of buying insurance” against fuel price volatility. “I’m absolutely confident that in the third or fourth quarter of this year, Kenya Airways will start opening hedge policies again. You can expect some hedging disclosures next year,” he said. Kenya Airways has also opened talks with the Kenya Airports Authority (KAA), the state organisation that runs all Kenyan airports, on a partnership that would allow it to run Nairobi’s main airport. Such a deal, which could come into effect before the end of this year, would provide the airline with fresh revenue streams such as landing fees from other carriers, said Chairman Michael Joseph, citing the example of Gulf-based rivals. “For us to compete with them (Gulf carriers) and to offer the same benefits that they offer we need to almost copy them,” he told the news conference. The proposal would enable Kenya Airways to increase its fleet from 32 to 55 and start flying to 20 new international destinations by 2022, an official government document seen by Reuters showed. Mikosz said the airline remained interested in potential orders of Bombardier’s CSeries short-haul jets ($1 = 100.7000 Kenyan shillings) (Editing by Jon Boyle)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/kenya-kenya-airways/update-2-kenya-airways-to-hedge-aviation-fuel-to-counter-volatility-idUKL8N1TO1B9,22 Jun 2018,"Kenya Airways will

2018-06-22,"(Repeats with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell BRISBANE, June 22 (Reuters) - Coal miners supplying Asia’s rapidly growing economies have plenty to be optimistic about as prices and demand appear robust, but they should be wary of getting caught up in the positive feedback loop that nearly destroyed them before. This week’s inaugural Energy Mines and Money conference in Brisbane, the heartland of the industry in top coal exporter Australia, was a sea of optimism about the outlook for the industry. Prices have been on an upward trend since bottoming in 2016 after five years of losses, and miners are once again making good profits amid strong demand from top importers China and India, new consumers such as Pakistan and the reliable veteran buyers like Japan and South Korea. But at the back of the minds of many Australian miners is the fear that they have seen this movie before, and they don’t want the same ending. In 2012, the industry was cock-a-hoop over forecasts that pointed to massive import demand growth in Asia, led by China and India. Mining and coal conferences at the time were well attended and featured masses of presentations from both junior and established companies, all with the common theme of how much they were going to invest in new mines and how much new production was coming to meet the massive Asian demand. Problem was it was pretty much all wrong. A well-respected industry consultant and forecaster boldly claimed in early 2012 that China would be importing 1 billion tonnes of coal by 2030, and India would be up to 400 million tonnes. While this was probably the most bullish forecast, it wasn’t terribly out of line with several other predictions. But these forecasts now look hopelessly optimistic, given China’s coal imports were 270.9 million tonnes in 2017. While imports have risen for two years, they are still well below the record 327.2 million tonnes from 2013. While China’s coal imports may rise slightly this year, it’s unlikely they will reach 300 million tonnes, and that 1 billion tonne forecast looks well out of reach. However, there is still no shortage of optimism among Australia’s coal miners, with industry group the Minerals Council of Australia releasing a report this week that harks back to the wildly bullish forecasts of the previous boom period. Asian seaborne coal imports will rise by 400 million tonnes from current levels by 2030, a more than 50-percent increase from 2017’s 740 million tonnes, according to the report, which was compiled by consultants Commodity Insights. The methodology of the report assumes that all planned and proposed coal-fired plants across Asia will be built, and then also relies on macro-economic forecasts. However, the trend is clear, planned and proposed coal-fired generation keeps getting cut back as the developed world largely turns away from the fuel, and as top importer China increasingly tightens environmental controls. In the two years to January there was a 59-percent drop in announced, pre-permit and permitted coal-fired generation, according to a report compiled by environmental groups Coalswarm, the Sierra Club and Greenpeace. While the report also shows operating coal-fired generation increased by 4 percent over the two-year period, it does seem clear that the pipeline of projects is slipping, and may in time not be enough to replace the closure of older power plants. The optimistic forecasts also fail to account for political pressure to move away from coal, not only in China, but increasingly in India. It’s likely that those countries planning on building coal plants powered by imports will also come under mounting pressure from environmental activists, who have become increasingly sophisticated in targeting how coal plants are financed and insured. In fact, if there was another common theme to this week’s conference in Brisbane, it’s that the coal sector still doesn’t fully grasp that array of forces now being deployed against it. The mantra of coal as ‘cheap and reliable and the only way to electrify the masses of people still without power’ was still repeated, and clearly believed. But scratch a little further and miners will tell you of the incredible difficulties in developing projects, with increased government scrutiny and regulation, the rising threat of public opposition and the dearth of financing, notwithstanding a seemingly large pool of investment funds. The inability of India’s Adani to actually start building its Carmichael mine in Queensland, the world’s largest planned mine aimed at supplying the seaborne market, plays on the industry’s mind, as does the virulent public opposition to the mine’s development. The exit of major companies such as Rio Tinto from coal has also made developing new mines difficult, as those firms could fund a project off their own balance sheets, and didn’t have to seek investors, partners or project financing. The lack of new supply also makes optimistic demand forecasts tricky. If Asia genuinely was to demand 400 million more tonnes of coal by 2030, it would take an unrealistically massive effort to develop mines to produce this. It simply can’t be done, meaning that prices would have to surge to either incentivise new production or cut back on demand as power generators switch to other fuels such as natural gas, or increase the use of renewables. The Australian government’s commodity forecasts are for modest growth in the region of 2 percent for coal output and exports, while Indonesia, the world’s largest exporter of thermal coal, has a policy of lowering exports over time in order to keep the resources for domestic consumption. With the world’s two biggest coal exporters not likely to boost their supplies to the seaborne market, the question is who can? And the answer is nobody really. South Africa also has domestic needs and export infrastructure constraints, Russia has plenty of coal but infrastructure issues, and the United States and Canada could probably add several million more tonnes a year, but this would be nowhere near enough. Overall, coal miners find themselves in the odd position of enjoying strong profits and growth in demand for their products, but equally largely unable to meet that demand because developing new mines is becoming too hard.

2018-06-22,"ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - South Sudan offered to allow a rebel representative to join its government on Friday, but ruled out Riek Machar, saying they had “had enough” of the rebel leader after five years of civil war. “Machar cannot be part of government. We have had enough of him,” Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth told a news conference in the Ethiopian capital. Despite that dismissal, Lueth said South Sudan’s President Salva Kiir would meet his arch-rival and former vice president Machar for face-to-face talks again next week. The two men met in Addis Ababa this week for the first time since a peace deal collapsed spectacularly in 2016, leading to the deaths of hundreds of people in fighting.  The war that broke out in 2013, less than two years after oil-rich South Sudan gained independence from Sudan, has killed tens of thousands and forced millions from their homes.     Footage released by the Ethiopian government showed Kiir and Machar shaking hands and hugging in a three-way embrace with Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed this week.  Machar’s rebel group SPLM-IO issued a statement calling the remarks from minister Lueth highly immature. “This bad politics is from a known peace spoiler and is only intended to derail the peace process,” it said. On Thursday the group condemned current efforts by regional bloc IGAD to convene meetings to discuss peace. “Workshops” will not stop the war and IGAD’s overall model is “unrealistic”, the rebels said.   Despite the mutual recriminations, Lueth said Kiir would meet Machar again next week in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan. “Preparations are afoot to give a new impetus to this new round of talks and ensure a successful outcome,” Sudan’s Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement.  The ministry said next week’s talks would be convened by Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, a key player in South Sudan’s history.  Before the people of South Sudan voted for secession and it declared independence in 2011, the region fought for more than two decades against Khartoum’s forces, led by Bashir. The international community, in particular the United States, played a major role in supporting the process that led to South Sudan gaining independence.  Last month the United Nations Security Council voted to renew some sanctions on South Sudan through mid-July and to consider imposing travel bans and asset freezes on six South Sudanese leaders unless the country’s conflict stops by June 30. Minister Lueth said Machar’s group was emboldened by sanctions against the South Sudan government and said the international community should levy measures against the rebels too.  Before arriving in Addis Ababa this week, Machar had been under house arrest in South Africa since 2016.  A spokesman for the rebel leader told Reuters Machar would travel to Khartoum on Sunday to attend the talks convened by Sudan. Sudan is a member of IGAD, which has led the faltering peace process for South Sudan for several years. IGAD persuaded the warring sides to sign a ceasefire in December, but violence resumed within hours.

2018-06-22,"PEDAVEEDU, India (Reuters) - India is fast-tracking environmental clearances for projects like power plants and coal mines in a bid to propel growth, setting off alarm bells among environmentalists and affected residents who say the decisions are being made too quickly. In a country where state machinery typically moves slowly, the environment ministry under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has slashed the average time taken to grant clearances to 170 days from 600 days, said two government sources with direct knowledge of the matter. “We’re standardizing processes and taking decisions swiftly,” said one of the officials, who did not want to be named, citing government policy. “We know the basic issues, and merely taking more time for approvals does not mean much.” The environment ministry did not respond to requests for comment. The push appears to be similar to U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to speed up infrastructure approvals - his administration has said it wants environmental reviews for major projects to take no longer than 21 months, instead of years. India’s industrial sector grew at 4.3 percent last year but growth slowed from 4.6 percent a year ago. The speedier approvals come as some big-ticket infrastructure projects face delays, including the proposed $100 billion Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor and the Japan-backed $17 billion bullet train. Any loss of jobs from slowing growth could hurt Modi as he seeks a second term in 2019. Environmental group Greenpeace says India’s construction sector and coal-fired power plants are major contributors to rising levels of particulate matter in the air. The World Health Organization says India is home to the world’s 14 most polluted cities. The PM10 index, which measures the concentration of particulate matter of 10 microns diameter or less in the air, hit 999 in the capital New Delhi last week, the highest measure on monitoring devices. This coarse particulate matter is mostly dust, which attaches to toxic material from other emissions. A level of 500 is considered “hazardous” and people are advised to remain indoors. The government halted construction activities in the capital and nearby cities to ease the pollution and by Friday afternoon it was at 124, although that is still considered unhealthy. “The way in which in the last ten years government has allowed power plants to come up in the periphery of Delhi and its surrounding region is a major contributor to pollution,” said Sunil Dahiya, senior campaigner with Greenpeace. Projects across the country cleared by the environment ministry this year include three new thermal power plants, a carbon black manufacturing facility, two cement plants and the expansion of four coal mines, according to government data. “Faster clearances can certainly compromise the quality of evaluation,” said Srestha Banerjee, program manager at the private Centre for Science and Environment. “By standardizing terms of references for various sectors the government has tried to reduce time in the environment clearance process. This is not a bad step. But in order to reduce time, it has exempted public hearing for some important sectors. This is extremely problematic.”         In India’s villages and smaller towns, protests are mounting against rapid industrialization because of the environmental damage. The Lambada, a tribe in the southern state of Telangana, is opposing a 200 megawatt coal-fired power plant near the village of Pedaveedu that the environment ministry cleared in 78 days this year. Environmentalists say it usually takes at least six months to clear such projects. The environment ministry did not respond to questions on the time taken for the approval. “I won’t let this power plant be constructed,” said Mudavath Vui, a 60-year old Lambada woman dressed in a bright blue embroidered top with clinking bells and coins and colorful beads around her neck. “I have seen my husband die from cancer and I don’t want this plant to increase our suffering.” Her community, which forms a major chunk of the population in three villages around the proposed site of the power plant to be built by privately held MG Power Projects, has also been opposing two large cement plants in the area that they accuse of triggering respiratory and other problems. Groups of Lambada villagers frequently gather around Pedaveedu to shout slogans against the power plant. They and activists said they plan to intensify protests against MG Power’s plant when construction starts. An MG official said the company is yet to firm up plans on starting construction.  Protests by villagers and local tribesmen have also erupted at Vedanta’s copper smelter in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, where 13 activists were killed in a protest last month, and at its bauxite mine in the state of Odisha. “FIXED TIME-FRAME” Securing faster environment clearances has become crucial for businesses that have struggled to overcome the chaotic implementation of a nationwide sales tax last year. This year the environment ministry has cleared 38 percent of  total projects within 100 days, compared with 16 percent in the same period a year ago, government data showed. The number of projects cleared has jumped 37 percent in the first five months of the year compared with the same period a year ago. Gujarat Agrochem Pvt Ltd, an insecticides, chemical and herbicide manufacturer in the western state of Gujarat, secured approval in April to expand a plant after submitting its proposal at January-end. The speed surprised the company itself, its regional head Sunish Nair told Reuters. Earlier this decade, the company had to wait two years to get the go-ahead to build a herbicide plant in Gujarat. By the time the approval came, in 2013, the project’s estimated cost had jumped 28 percent and demand for the particular product waned, Nair said. “It seems they are now adhering to a fixed time-frame,” Nair said, welcoming the faster clearance process under the current government. In Pedaveedu, however, the fast clearances have led to even more entrenched opposition. “We will pour kerosene onto ourselves and die, but not let the power plant be set up,” said V. Koteshwar Rao, a resident and vice-president of the Jana Chaitanya Society, a local activist group.

2018-06-22,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Nichola Groom, Salvador Rodriguez and Kristina Cooke LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO, June 21 (Reuters) - Electric car maker Tesla Inc’s move last week to cut 9 percent of its workforce will sharply downsize the residential solar business it bought two years ago in a controversial $2.6 billion deal, according to three internal company documents and seven current and former Tesla solar employees. The latest cuts to the division that was once SolarCity - a sales and installation company founded by two cousins of Tesla CEO Elon Musk - include closing about a dozen installation facilities, according to internal company documents, and ending a retail partnership with Home Depot Inc that the current and former employees said generated about half of its sales. About 60 installation facilities remain open, according to an internal company list reviewed by Reuters. An internal company email named 14 facilities slated for closure, but the other list included only 13 of those locations. Tesla declined to comment on which sites it planned to shut down, how many employees would lose their jobs or what percentage of the solar workforce they represent. The company said that cuts to its overall energy team - including batteries to store power - were in line with the broader 9 percent staff cut. “We continue to expect that Tesla’s solar and battery business will be the same size as automotive over the long term,” the company said in a statement to Reuters. The operational closures, which have not been previously reported, raise new questions about the viability of cash-strapped Tesla’s solar business and Musk’s rationale for a merger he once called a “no brainer” - but some investors have panned as a bailout of an affiliated firm at the expense of Tesla shareholders. Before the merger, Musk had served as chairman of SolarCity’s board of directors. The installation offices that the internal email said were targeted for closure were located in California, Maryland, New Jersey, Texas, New York, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Arizona and Delaware. The company also fired dozens of solar customer service staffers at call centers in Nevada and Utah, according to the former Tesla employees, some of whom were terminated in last week’s cuts. Those employees spoke on condition of anonymity because making public comments could violate the terms of their severance packages. “It’s been a difficult few days - no one can deny this,” a Tesla manager wrote in a seperate internal email, sent to customer service employees shortly after the cuts were announced. Tesla has been burning through cash as it tries to hit a target of producing 5,000 Model 3 electric sedans per week after production delays. The company faces investor pressure to turn a profit without having to tap Wall Street for additional capital. The total number of cuts to the solar workforce remained unclear. Some personnel at facilities closing down were being transferred to other sites, the current and former employees said. SolarCity employed about 15,000 people at the end of 2015 but has since cut thousands of workers. Ending the Home Depot partnership, which allowed for solar sales in about 800 stores, is part of Tesla’s larger effort to absorb SolarCity into its high-end brand and sell through 90 of its 109 U.S. retail stores and its website, the company said. “Tesla stores have some of the highest foot traffic of any retail space in the country,” Tesla said. Analysts questioned Tesla’s plans for the solar business in light of the latest cuts to staff and retail operations. “In effect they seem to be saying, ‘We have no strategy for selling solar,’” said Frank Gillett, an analyst at Forrester Research, adding that the SolarCity purchase “looks pretty awful right now.” In the first quarter of this year, Tesla installed 76 megawatts of solar systems - down from SolarCity’s more than 200 MW a quarter in early 2016, when it was the leading player in the industry. In announcing quarterly results in February, Tesla said growth in solar deployments would resume later this year. Tesla’s falling solar sales also could jeopardize the future of a joint venture with Panasonic, announced as Tesla moved to acquire SolarCity in 2016, to produce solar modules at a new factory in Buffalo, New York. Tesla has an agreement with New York state requiring the company to spend $5 billion within 10 years. If Tesla fails to meet that obligation and others, the company may be required to pay tens of millions of dollars in penalties at various milestones, could lose its lease, or be forced to write down the assets, the company told investors in a May filing. In response to questions from Reuters, Tesla said it is meeting its hiring and spending commitments for the factory. In March, a Delaware judge ruled against a Tesla motion to dismiss a lawsuit by the company’s shareholders over the SolarCity deal. The lawsuit alleged Tesla’s board of directors breached its duties to shareholders by approving the merger. SolarCity founder Lyndon Rive, who is Musk’s first cousin and left Tesla last year, did not respond to a request for comment. The move to end the longstanding Home Depot partnership blindsided many staffers because Tesla had announced an expansion of the arrangement as recently as February. GTM Research analyst Austin Perea estimated the partnership has recently accounted for about half of sales, in part because of previous Tesla moves to cut back on other sales and marketing costs. Such third-party retail partnerships are among the most expensive means of generating solar sales, according to the clean energy research firm, in part because retailers take a cut of each sale. The cost of winning a customer through a store like Home Depot can be up to $7,000 per system, according to GTM Research, compared with a national average of $4,000 per installation. Home Depot spokesman Stephen Holmes said the retailer’s relationship with Tesla would last through the end of the year, adding that Home Depot would continue a partnership with Tesla competitor Sunrun in an undisclosed number of stores. Over the past year, Tesla has stepped up efforts to sell solar and batteries for energy storage in its retail stores, something Musk said last year was “a much more efficient channel for demand generation.” At the same time, Tesla stopped door-to-door sales, once among SolarCity’s most successful means of reaching new customers, and salespeople were no longer allowed to hold local events or buy online leads, the former employees said. Such tactics are standard practice across most of the competitive residential solar industry. The Home Depot partnership was costly but also integral to Tesla’s solar panel sales, a former employee told Reuters. “It’s an expensive account,” the former employee said, “but it does bring in all the revenue.” (Reporting by Nichola Groom in Los Angeles and Salvador Rodriquez and Kristina Cooke in San Francisco Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Brian Thevenot)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/tesla-solar/rpt-exclusive-tesla-to-close-a-dozen-solar-facilities-in-nine-states-documents-idUKL1N1TO01C,22 Jun 2018,"Electric car

2018-06-22,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Venezuela has the ability to boost crude output by 1 million barrels per day (bpd) by end of the year in its bid to recover lost production, but the oil minister also said on Friday this goal would be “a challenge” for state oil firm PDVSA. President Nicolas Maduro said last month PDVSA would aim to boost oil production by 1 million bpd this year, and would seek help from Russia, China and OPEC if needed. Output has plummeted under U.S. sanctions and due to an economic crisis. “We hope that by year-end, we will have recovered the lost production, we have the capacity to do so, we’ve said so,” Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo told reporters at a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna. “This is a goal for 2018 that is very challenging for PDVSA ... but it’s the goal we’ve set ourselves,” Quevedo said. The minister, who is also head of PDVSA, earlier said Venezuela was pumping about 1.5 million bpd of oil. The country had been producing about 2.373 million bpd as recently as 2016, Thomson Reuters data shows. PDVSA’s oil exports fell 32 percent in the first half of June compared with May, according to internal trade reports from the state-run company, as deepening output declines and seizures of some Caribbean assets disrupted crude and fuel shipments. U.S. oil firm ConocoPhilips (COP.N) won court orders in May allowing it to seize PDVSA assets as part of a $2 billion arbitration award in its favor. It seized a several crude cargoes and fuel terminals, further disrupting Venezuelan exports. “The discussions we have with Conoco, we want to further those in the coming weeks,” Quevedo said. “We aren’t commenting on any dialogue with PDVSA,” - ConocoPhillips spokesman Daren Beaudo. To meet its commitments to consumers, PDVSA has drawn up a plan to process up to 57,000 bpd of foreign crude in June to fulfil export contracts and reduce purchases of fuels for domestic use. “We have a recovery plan with the refineries to use the capacity that we have ...  we have a lot of spare capacity that we will use as (crude) output increases,” Quevedo said.

2018-06-22,"(Adds quotes, background) VIENNA, June 22 (Reuters) - The head of Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) confirmed on Friday that Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) had regained control of the key oil ports of Ras Lanuf and Es Sider, and said he hoped operations would resume in the “next couple of days”. NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said Libya had been losing 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) of production after clashes between the LNA and rival factions closed the two terminals. The LNA took the ports back on Thursday in heavy fighting, a week after an attack by anti-Haftar armed groups had forced them to withdraw. “We lost 450,000 bpd in last eight to nine days and hopefully in next couple of days we can resume operations,” Sanalla told reporters ahead of an OPEC meeting in Vienna. A fire that broke out at a third storage tank in Ras Lanuf on Thursday had been put out, he said. “We had a minor fire yesterday and we extinguished it and the situation there is good. We will make the assessments and then resume operations as soon as possible.” Two other storage tanks at Ras Lanuf had caught on fire earlier in the fighting, causing extensive damage. Libya’s national oil production has dropped to between 600,000 and 700,000 bpd due to the closure of the ports.

2018-06-22,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders will next week extend until the end of January economic sanctions against Russia over its intervention in Ukraine, diplomats and officials said.  The curbs on Russia’s energy, defence and financial sectors have been prolonged every six months since first being slapped mid-2014 after Moscow annexed the peninsula of Crimea from Kiev and backed rebels fighting government troops in east Ukraine. EU leaders meeting in Brussels on June 28-29 will agree another six-month extension of the curbs on doing business with Russia currently in place until the end of July.  Moscow vows to never return Crimea and the east Ukraine conflict has killed more than 10,000 people and turned into a frozen confrontation, with low-intensity, sporadic fighting still taking place regularly. The decision follows talks between the world’s seven most industrialised countries (G7) who met in Canada earlier in June. The format used to be held as G8 but Russia was kicked out in 2014 over Crimea.  Since then, the leaders of the world’s leading powers have used their annual meetings to coordinate their stance. This year, they called on Moscow to stop undermining democracies and said in their statement:  “We recall that the continuation of sanctions is clearly linked to Russia’s failure to demonstrate complete implementation of its commitments in the (peace) Minsk Agreements and respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty.” Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said he wanted to re-admit Russia but also signed up for another sanctions extension at the meeting in Canada, the first major international gathering for the head of the new populist government. “Italy thinks it is important to have a dialogue with Russia but this does not mean that the system of sanctions can be overcome overnight,” Conte has said.  The EU is also at loggerheads with Russia over its role in the war in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, as well as the Kremlin’s track record on human rights.  It also blames Moscow for a March attack in the British town of Salisbury on a former Russian spy using a Russian-made military grade nerve agent. Moscow denies guilt.

The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks stocks in 47 countries, was up 0.2 percent in the European morning but down 1.3 percent on the week, its worst weekly showing since mid-March. Investor anxiety over a possible full-blown trade war has deepened this week over increasingly sharp rhetoric between the United States and China, and growing evidence of the economic damage such a conflict could produce. German carmaker Daimler cut its earnings forecast earlier this week, saying tariffs on cars exported from the United States to China would hurt Mercedes-Benz sales. India joined the European Union and China in retaliating against U.S. President Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminium, raising import duties on U.S. almonds by 20 percent. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday the United States needed to make it harder for its trading partners to have high trade barriers in order to achieve Trump’s ultimate goal of lower tariffs and a level playing field. Chinese state media said on Friday that U.S. protectionism was self-defeating and a “symptom of paranoid delusions” that must not distract China from its path to modernisation. “With no negotiations in sight at the moment, our base case (scenario) is shifting to a further escalation of the trade conflict between the two countries,” wrote analysts at Danske Bank in a note to clients. There is a risk of a further deterioration in relations on June 30, when Washington is due to announce a plan to restrict Chinese investments into the United States and limit exports of U.S. tech products to China, they added. Strong financial stocks and better-than-expected euro zone purchasing managers index for services helped drive a timid relief bounce in European shares. The pan-European STOXX 600 and its euro zone counterpart were set for their biggest weekly loss in three months as the consequences of rising protectionism sank in, notably for the autos sector. The strong PMIs also boosted the euro. It was last up half a percent on the day and was set to end the week higher by half a percent. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was 0.2 percent lower. Against the yen, the greenback was little changed. It was modestly higher at 110.14 yen, below a one-week high of 110.76 scaled the previous day amid lingering concerns over the U.S.-China trade dispute. “The potential for all-out trade war, European political risks and emerging market volatility remain potent factors that should contain dollar/yen within the current range, though the lack of downside over the last week or so suggests stronger underlying demand,” wrote Robert Rennie, head of market strategy at Westpac. The European PMIs also showed manufacturing growth was the weakest in 18 months on trade worries. Elsewhere in Europe, Greece’s borrowing costs fell to four-week lows on Friday after Athens won debt relief from the euro zone. Sterling was half a percent higher against the dollar on Friday, extending gains made the previous day after the Bank of England’s chief economist Andy Haldane unexpectedly joined the minority of policymakers calling for a UK interest rate hike, citing concerns about growing wage pressure. Oil prices rose on uncertainty ahead of a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other major producers including Russia starting in Vienna later in the day. Saudi Arabia and Russia are in favour of raising output. Other OPEC-members, including Iran, have opposed this, resulting in a flurry of backdoor diplomacy ahead of the meeting. Brent crude traded at $74.00 a barrel, up 1.3 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 1.1 percent to $66.27 per barrel. Earlier in Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped as much as 0.35 percent at one point to touch its weakest since early December, before erasing losses to be up 0.15 percent. Still it was 2.3 percent off for the week. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng plumbed six-month lows, having lost 3.9 percent so far this week. South Korea’s KOSPI hit nine-month lows and in mainland China, the CSI300 index lost almost 5 percent this week to one-year lows. Japan’s Nikkei gave up 0.8 percent for a weekly loss of 1.7 percent.

The fire started on Thursday afternoon in the chimney of a utility unit that supplies electricity, water and steam to multiple petrochemical facilities at the firm’s Osaka Works in Takaishi City. The local fire department confirmed the blaze had been extinguished by 8:30 a.m. on Friday (2330 GMT on Thursday), the company said in a statement. An investigation is underway into the cause of the accident and its impact on the plant and the local environment, although no toxic gas that could affect human health had been detected, it added. There were no injuries. The company has not so far identified any damage to other plant facilities including a 500,000 tonne-per-year naphtha cracker, which has been shut since June 14 for scheduled maintenance. The company may consider alternative sources of electricity and steam to supply the plant’s petrochemical facilities, a company spokesman said. It was not immediately clear whether the cracker’s restart would be delayed from its current schedule of late July. The company said it would promptly report any major financial impact from the fire. The fire did not have an immediate impact on the market because the naphtha cracker was shut, said a trading source, who declined to be identified.

OPEC’s de facto leader Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC Russia have said a production increase of about 1 million barrels per day (bpd) or around 1 percent of global supply had become a near-consensus proposal for the group and its allies. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will be gathering in Vienna amid calls from top consumers the United States, China and India to cool down the price of crude and prevent an oil shortage that would hurt the global economy. “It will be a hard meeting today. I wouldn’t say all will accept the 1 million bpd proposed,” an OPEC delegate said, adding the group could agree on a lower figure. Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, has so far been the main barrier to a deal as it called on OPEC to reject pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to pump more oil. Trump imposed fresh sanctions on Tehran in May and market watchers expect Iran’s output to drop by a third by the end of 2018. That means the country has little to gain from a deal to raise OPEC output, unlike arch-rival Saudi Arabia. “I don’t think we can reach agreement,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Thursday. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the overwhelming majority of producers had recommended raising output by 1 million bpd, gradually and on a pro-rata basis. OPEC and its allies have since last year been participating in a pact to cut output by 1.8 million bpd. The measure has helped rebalance the market in the past 18 months and lifted oil to around $74 per barrel from as low as $27 in 2016. But unexpected outages in Venezuela, Libya and Angola have effectively brought supply cuts to around 2.8 million bpd in recent months. Brent oil prices were up 1 percent on Friday. Falih has warned the world could face a supply deficit of up to 1.8 million bpd in the second half of 2018 and that OPEC’s responsibility was to address consumers’ worries. “We want to prevent the shortage and the squeeze that we saw in 2007-2008,” Falih said, referring to a time when oil rallied close to $150 per barrel. Earlier this week, Zanganeh left the door open for a deal, saying OPEC members that had overdelivered on cuts in recent months should comply with agreed quotas. That would effectively mean a modest boost from producers such as Saudi Arabia that have voluntarily cut more deeply than planned. Zanganeh has said that if OPEC returned to regular compliance, the group would raise output by around 460,000 bpd. Falih also said the real increase would be smaller than the nominal gain of 1 million bpd, meaning a compromise with Iran remained possible. OPEC sources also said Iran had demanded that U.S. sanctions be mentioned in the group’s post-meeting communique, as Tehran has blamed U.S. measures for the recent rise in oil prices. The United States, which rivals Russia and Saudi Arabia for the position of world No.1 oil producer, is not participating in the current supply pact.

2018-06-22,"* Gap closed by weaker demand forecast, stronger supply outlook * Wind, solar growth shrinks need for gas-fired power * But would-be LNG importers undeterred (Adds comment from prospective LNG importers) By Sonali Paul MELBOURNE, June 22 (Reuters) - Australia no longer faces a looming gas shortage, thanks to government pressure on exporters to divert the commodity into local markets and a reduced demand forecast for gas-fired power, according to estimates from the nation’s energy market operator. “No supply gaps are forecast before 2030 under expected market conditions,” the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) said on Friday in its annual outlook for gas. That is starkly different from a year ago, when dire warnings from the body about potential shortfalls in eastern Australia from 2018 onward prompted the government to threaten to curb liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. The nation’s three east coast LNG plants, operated by Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips, and Santos , averted those curbs by promising to plug the expected deficit. Their moves, combined with greater availability of LNG on the global market, the start-up of a new pipeline from the Northern Territory to Queensland, and growth in wind and solar power diminishing the need for gas-fired power, have eliminated the feared shortage, AEMO said. “Alongside international market changes, newly committed electricity generation resources have resulted in a favourable increase of gas availability for the east coast market,” AEMO executive general manager David Swift said in a statement. More than 4,000 megawatts of wind and solar power are due to start up in the next two years, which should ease demand for gas-fired power except when renewable generation is low, he said. AEMO cut its gas consumption forecast for 2019 by 55 petajoules from its last estimate made in September, while increasing its gas production outlook from fields in the southern states by 16 PJ. In September, it had predicted a supply gap of between 54 PJ and 107 PJ for 2018, or up to 17 percent of market demand. An extra 8 PJ of gas has also been freed up for the local market as a global LNG glut has given overseas buyers more supply choice, AEMO said. While producers told the market operator output would increase from southern gas fields, AEMO’s forecasts “still show that further exploration and development will be needed to meet demand from as early as 2022”, Swift said. Production forecasts from gas producers show an increase in output of 144 PJ between 2019 and 2022, AEMO said, while flagging those new supplies will be more costly to produce than existing production. The sharply changed view has not deterred groups considering importing LNG to southeastern Australia within the next two years, as they see the assumptions on future gas production as bullish and view LNG import terminals as much cheaper to install than developing new gas fields. “For the sake of a new entrant and a compelling, certain product, I just think imports win, hands down,” said James Baulderstone, chief executive of Australian Industrial Energy, one of at least three groups considering importing LNG.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped as much as 0.35 percent at one point to touch its weakest since early December before erasing losses to be up 0.15 percent. Still it was 2.3 percent off for the week. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng plumbed six-month lows, having lost 3.9 percent so far this week. South Korea’s KOSPI hit nine-month lows and in mainland China, the CSI300 index lost almost 5 percent this week to one-year lows. Japan’s Nikkei gave up 0.8 percent for a weekly loss of 1.7 percent. European stock futures point to slightly firmer openings in Britain’s FTSE , France’s CAC  and Germany’s DAX  from multi-week lows hit the previous day. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for an eighth straight session on Thursday and the S&P 500 lost 0.63 percent, with industrials and materials shares taking a hard knock. Even the high-flying Nasdaq Composite, which has outperformed this year on the perception that high-tech shares were less vulnerable to trade wars, shed 0.88 percent. In a sign that escalating tensions between the United States and its trade partners were taking a toll on the economy, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s gauge of U.S. Mid-Atlantic business activity fell to a 1-1/2 year low. “The Philadelphia Fed’s survey showed a drop in new orders. Investors are concerned that the trade frictions are starting to affect corporate sentiment and their activities,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. The impact on corporate profits has become tangible, with German carmaker Daimler cutting its earnings forecast on Wednesday, saying tariffs on cars exported from the United States to China would hurt Mercedes-Benz sales. Despite budding evidence of economic damage, trade frictions have shown no sign of abating. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday the United States needs to make it harder for its trading partners to have high trade barriers in order to achieve President Donald Trump’s ultimate goal of lower tariffs and a level playing field. India joined the European Union and China in retaliating against Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminium, raising import duties on U.S. almonds by 20 percent and leveraging its position as the world’s biggest buyer of the product. While some investors still hope Washington and Beijing can work out a deal before July 6, when the first round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods as well as retaliatory tariffs by China are due to take effect, others see diminishing hopes of an early compromise. Worsening sentiment pushed U.S. bond yields lower and triggered profit-taking in the dollar. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell to 2.910 percent from Thursday’s high of 2.950 percent and its three-week high of 3.010 percent touched on Wednesday last week. As the dollar lost steam, the euro bounced back to $1.1630 after hitting an 11-month low of $1.1508 on Thursday. The single currency had fallen on bets of a protracted period of monetary policy divergence between the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. In addition, the Italian government’s appointment on Thursday of two eurosceptics to head key finance committees reignited worries about anti-euro voices in the euro zone’s third-largest economy. The British pound jumped back from a seven-month trough after the Bank of England’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, unexpectedly joined the minority of policymakers calling for rates to rise to 0.75 percent, citing concerns about growing wage pressure. The pound last fetched $1.3270, off Thursday’s low of $1.3102. The Chinese yuan weakened about 0.15 percent in both onshore and offshore trades, staying near their lowest levels since mid-January. “If the U.S. puts more pressure on China with tariffs, I would suspect the Chinese authorities would like to drive the yuan lower to mitigate the impact,” said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank. Oil prices rose on uncertainty ahead of a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other major producers including Russia starting later on Friday. Saudi Arabia and Russia have said a production increase of about 1 million barrels per day (bpd) or around 1 percent of global supply had become a near-consensus proposal for the group and its allies, but Iran held out against a deal amid the prospect of lower exports due to U.S. sanctions on Tehran. Brent crude traded at $74.00 a barrel, up 95 cents, or 1.3 percent, a day after it had fallen $1.69. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 89 cents, or 1.35 percent to $66.42 per barrel.

2018-06-22,"ULAANBAATAR, June 22 (Reuters) - Mongolia launched construction of its first oil refinery on Friday, a long-awaited project that is funded by India and designed to end the country’s dependence on Russian fuel. Friday’s ground-breaking ceremony was attended by Mongolian Prime Minister Khurelsukh Ukhnaa and Indian Minister of Home Affairs Rajnath Singh. The refinery, in southern Dornogovi province will be capable of processing 1.5 million tonnes of crude oil per year, said Mongol Refinery, the state-owned company building the project, in a press release. That is about 30,000 barrels per day (bpd). The refinery will be small by international standards, with most Chinese facilities each processing hundreds of thousands of barrels of crude per day, and India’s Reliance Industries running one refinery at a record 1.2 million bpd. Still, Mongolia’s new refinery, planned for completion in late 2022, will meet all of the nation’s demand for gasoline, diesel, aviation fuel and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). “By establishing this strategically important oil refinery, the national economy will become independent from energy imports, and fuel and commodity prices will be stabilised,” said Mongol Refinery in its statement. The project is expected to boost Mongolia’s gross domestic product by 10 percent, it said. Mongolia imported almost 1.5 million tonnes of oil products last year, virtually all from Russia. They amounted to 18 percent of all Mongolia’s imports, according to official data. Mongolia, a large landlocked country wedged between giants China and Russia, has a population of just 3 million. Almost half its people live as nomadic stock herders, and the country’s oil demand is growing only very slowly. “From a national security perspective, we do need to diversify our sources of oil products from the current single source, Russia,” said Munkhdul Badral Bontoi, chief executive of Mongolia-based market intelligence group Cover Mongolia. The cost of the refinery is estimated at $1.35 billion, and it will include a pipeline and its own power plant. The refinery will process Mongolia’s own crude oil, which is now sold to China. Mongolia produced 7.6 million barrels of oil last year, about 21,000 bpd, amounting to 6 percent of its total export earnings. The country’s petroleum industry regulator is expecting its crude oil output to rise over the years prior to the refinery’s start-up. Mongolia’s big southern neighbour China produces around 3.8 million bpd of crude, and imports more than 9 million bpd, according to official government data. A Mongolian oil refinery has been discussed since 1997, but while several projects were approved, none have been completed. The refinery’s financing is part of a $1 billion credit line agreement between Mongolia and the Export-Import Bank of India, made during a 2015 visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The Indian guarantee is what put the odds in favour of the oil refinery being finally built, but the biggest worry here is whether the oil refinery can pay for itself,” said Munkhdul. “Economically, I’m sceptical of the viability of a domestic oil refinery, as fuel prices are heavily regulated,” he said.

2018-06-22,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell BRISBANE, June 22 (Reuters) - Coal miners supplying Asia’s rapidly growing economies have plenty to be optimistic about as prices and demand appear robust, but they should be wary of getting caught up in the positive feedback loop that nearly destroyed them before. This week’s inaugural Energy Mines and Money conference in Brisbane, the heartland of the industry in top coal exporter Australia, was a sea of optimism about the outlook for the industry. Prices have been on an upward trend since bottoming in 2016 after five years of losses, and miners are once again making good profits amid strong demand from top importers China and India, new consumers such as Pakistan and the reliable veteran buyers like Japan and South Korea. But at the back of the minds of many Australian miners is the fear that they have seen this movie before, and they don’t want the same ending. In 2012, the industry was cock-a-hoop over forecasts that pointed to massive import demand growth in Asia, led by China and India. Mining and coal conferences at the time were well attended and featured masses of presentations from both junior and established companies, all with the common theme of how much they were going to invest in new mines and how much new production was coming to meet the massive Asian demand. Problem was it was pretty much all wrong. A well-respected industry consultant and forecaster boldly claimed in early 2012 that China would be importing 1 billion tonnes of coal by 2030, and India would be up to 400 million tonnes. While this was probably the most bullish forecast, it wasn’t terribly out of line with several other predictions. But these forecasts now look hopelessly optimistic, given China’s coal imports were 270.9 million tonnes in 2017. While imports have risen for two years, they are still well below the record 327.2 million tonnes from 2013. While China’s coal imports may rise slightly this year, it’s unlikely they will reach 300 million tonnes, and that 1 billion tonne forecast looks well out of reach. However, there is still no shortage of optimism among Australia’s coal miners, with industry group the Minerals Council of Australia releasing a report this week that harks back to the wildly bullish forecasts of the previous boom period. Asian seaborne coal imports will rise by 400 million tonnes from current levels by 2030, a more than 50-percent increase from 2017’s 740 million tonnes, according to the report, which was compiled by consultants Commodity Insights. The methodology of the report assumes that all planned and proposed coal-fired plants across Asia will be built, and then also relies on macro-economic forecasts. However, the trend is clear, planned and proposed coal-fired generation keeps getting cut back as the developed world largely turns away from the fuel, and as top importer China increasingly tightens environmental controls. In the two years to January there was a 59-percent drop in announced, pre-permit and permitted coal-fired generation, according to a report compiled by environmental groups Coalswarm, the Sierra Club and Greenpeace. While the report also shows operating coal-fired generation increased by 4 percent over the two-year period, it does seem clear that the pipeline of projects is slipping, and may in time not be enough to replace the closure of older power plants. The optimistic forecasts also fail to account for political pressure to move away from coal, not only in China, but increasingly in India. It’s likely that those countries planning on building coal plants powered by imports will also come under mounting pressure from environmental activists, who have become increasingly sophisticated in targeting how coal plants are financed and insured. In fact, if there was another common theme to this week’s conference in Brisbane, it’s that the coal sector still doesn’t fully grasp that array of forces now being deployed against it. The mantra of coal as ‘cheap and reliable and the only way to electrify the masses of people still without power’ was still repeated, and clearly believed. But scratch a little further and miners will tell you of the incredible difficulties in developing projects, with increased government scrutiny and regulation, the rising threat of public opposition and the dearth of financing, notwithstanding a seemingly large pool of investment funds. The inability of India’s Adani to actually start building its Carmichael mine in Queensland, the world’s largest planned mine aimed at supplying the seaborne market, plays on the industry’s mind, as does the virulent public opposition to the mine’s development. The exit of major companies such as Rio Tinto from coal has also made developing new mines difficult, as those firms could fund a project off their own balance sheets, and didn’t have to seek investors, partners or project financing. The lack of new supply also makes optimistic demand forecasts tricky. If Asia genuinely was to demand 400 million more tonnes of coal by 2030, it would take an unrealistically massive effort to develop mines to produce this. It simply can’t be done, meaning that prices would have to surge to either incentivise new production or cut back on demand as power generators switch to other fuels such as natural gas, or increase the use of renewables. The Australian government’s commodity forecasts are for modest growth in the region of 2 percent for coal output and exports, while Indonesia, the world’s largest exporter of thermal coal, has a policy of lowering exports over time in order to keep the resources for domestic consumption. With the world’s two biggest coal exporters not likely to boost their supplies to the seaborne market, the question is who can? And the answer is nobody really. South Africa also has domestic needs and export infrastructure constraints, Russia has plenty of coal but infrastructure issues, and the United States and Canada could probably add several million more tonnes a year, but this would be nowhere near enough. Overall, coal miners find themselves in the odd position of enjoying strong profits and growth in demand for their products, but equally largely unable to meet that demand because developing new mines is becoming too hard.

2018-06-22,"(Repeats with no changes to text) * To maintain U.S. oil imports until September -Unipec exec * U.S.-China spat heightens risk of U.S. oil imports -sources * Demand for U.S. crude loading from August to fall -sources By Florence Tan and Chen Aizhu SINGAPORE/BEIJING, June 21 (Reuters) - Chinese oil buyers will keep taking crude from the United States through September, but plan to reduce future purchases to avoid a likely import tariff amid a trade spat between the world’s two largest economies, multiple industry sources said. Beijing has put U.S. energy products, including crude oil and refined products, on lists of goods that it will hit with import taxes in retaliation for similar moves by Washington. Beijing did not specify when it will impose a 25 percent tax on oil, and that gives buyers time to adjust purchases while waiting for the outcome of trade talks, the sources said. Unipec, trading arm of Sinopec - Asia’s largest refiner and biggest buyer of U.S. oil  - has been offering U.S. crude, such as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Midland, to other Asian buyers for July, said three sources with knowledge of the offers. “They (Unipec) only offer crude for September arrival, that means July-loading cargoes,” one of the sources said, although adding that the offer was “quite expensive”. Unipec officials said this was normal trading activity, as the trading unit often re-sells excess crude from its refining system depending on economics and the state of its supplies. A top trading executive with Sinopec told Reuters the state refiner will maintain its usual import volumes for July-loadings, but can’t commit to bookings further out. “Future purchases (from August-loading onwards) will depend on developments,” said the executive, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject. A Sinopec spokesman declined to comment. Unipec said early this year that the company expects to trade up to 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of U.S. crude oil by the end of the year, about triple the trading volume last year. That will be worth roughly $7.7 billion over the whole year based on $70 per barrel of oil. “If the tariff is a long-term problem, the U.S. is going to struggle to find a market as big as China,” Joe Willis, senior research analyst at Wood Mackenzie said at a Thomson Reuters industry seminar on Thursday. “I don’t see a major impact on our purchasing programme. Cargoes for July loadings are unlikely be affected,” said a planning executive with a Sinopec plant that buys 1 million to 2 million barrels of U.S. oil every month. His plant this week nominated internally with Unipec for an August loading plan that is expected to be finalised a month later, said the planning executive. China shipped in 3.89 million tonnes, or about 315,500 bpd of U.S. crude in the first quarter of this year, nearly eight times the amount a year earlier and 3.5 percent of China’s top crude oil imports, according to Chinese customs. The grades include WTI, Mars and Southern Green Canyon. Nevertheless, uncertainty over the timing of the tariff and the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks has kept some buyers from booking further ahead. Chinese refineries typically order U.S. oil three months in advance due to shipping distances. “We don’t even know whether it will eventually be carried out. What if the U.S. and China compromise and things change overnight?” said a third source, who deals U.S. oil with an independent refiner, adding that his company will stop booking U.S. crude for September deliveries into China. Sinopec refinery sources said finding alternative supplies won’t be an issue as U.S. oil is relatively new to the Chinese market, and can be replaced by North Sea grades like Forties, Middle Eastern supplies or Russia’s Urals crude.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday the United States needs to make it harder for its trading partners to have high trade barriers in order to achieve President Donald Trump’s ultimate goal of lower tariffs and a level playing field. India joined the European Union and China in retaliating against Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminium, raising import duties on U.S. almonds by 20 percent and leveraging its position as the world’s biggest buyer of the product. While some investors still hope Washington and Beijing could work out a deal before July 6, when the first round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods as well as retaliatory tariffs by China are due to take effect, others see diminishing hopes of a early compromise. Worsening sentiment pushed U.S. bond yields lower and triggered profit-taking in the dollar. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell to 2.899 percent from Thursday’s high of 2.950 percent and its three-week high of 3.010 percent touched Wednesday last week. As the dollar lost steam, the euro bounced back to $1.1606 after hitting an 11-month low of $1.1508 on Thursday. The single currency had fallen on bets of a protracted period of monetary policy divergence between the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. In addition, the Italian government’s appointment on Thursday of two eurosceptics to head key finance committees reignited worries about anti-euro voices in the euro zone’s third-largest economy. The British pound jumped back from a seven-month trough after the Bank of England’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, unexpectedly joined the minority of policymakers calling for rates to rise to 0.75 percent, citing concerns about growing wage pressure. The pound last fetched $1.3248, off Thursday’s low of $1.3102. The dollar changed hands at 109.91 yen, having slipped 0.65 percent so far this week. MSCI emerging market index fell to its lowest level in almost nine months this week as they were also hurt by rising U.S. interest rates, which could prompt fund outflows and also raise funding costs for many borrowers in those countries. Some emerging market countries have recently raised interest rates to stem decline in their currencies.. Oil prices were volatile ahead of a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other major producers including Russia starting later on Friday. Saudi Arabia and Russia have said a production increase of about 1 million barrels per day (bpd) or around 1 percent of global supply had become a near-consensus proposal for the group and its allies but Iran held out against a deal amid the prospect of lower exports due to U.S. sanctions on Tehran. Brent crude traded at $74.11 a barrel, up about a dollar, or 1.45 percent on Friday, a day after it had fallen $1.69. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery rose 92 cents to $66.46 per barrel. Reporting by Hideyuki Sano

2018-06-22,"SINGAPORE, June 22 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose by more than 1 percent in early Asian trading on Friday, pushed up by uncertainty over whether OPEC would manage to agree a production increase at a meeting in Vienna later in the day. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $74.07 per barrel at 0034 GMT, up $1.02 cents, or 1.4 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $66.45 a barrel, up 90 cents, or 1.4 percent. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), a producer cartel de-facto led by top exporter Saudi Arabia, is meeting together with some non-OPEC members including top producer Russia at its headquarters in the Austrian capital to discuss output policy. The group started withholding supply in 2017 to prop up prices. Amid strong demand, the market has since tightened significantly, pushing up crude prices and triggering calls by consumers to increase supplies. Saudi Arabia and Russia are in favour of raising output. Other OPEC-members, including Iran, have opposed this, resulting in a flurry of backdoor diplomacy ahead of the meeting, which starts on Friday. “The actual decision by OPEC and its partners – which may not actually become apparent until Saturday – is the big one traders are watching,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader. The other big uncertainty in markets is potential Chinese tariffs on U.S. crude imports that Beijing may impose in an escalating trade dispute between the United States on one side and China, the European Union and India on the other. Should the 25 percent duty on U.S. crude imports be implemented by Beijing, American oil would become uncompetitive in China, forcing it to seek buyers elsewhere. “If China’s import demand dries up, more than 300,000 barrels per day of U.S. crude will have to find a new destination,” energy consultancy FGE said, adding that “this will certainly depress U.S. Gulf Coast prices”.

2018-06-22,"KIBWEZI, Kenya, June 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - K enyan farmer Sam Mung’ala once struggled to feed his family by growing cowpeas and sorghum. These days he is betting on a new type of merchandise: shopping bags. The farmer from Kibwezi town in the country’s south is planting and selling sisal, a source of fibre that roadside vendors and market traders use to make carrier bags. “A kilo used to sell for 30 Kenyan shillings ($0.30) but now it can fetch up to 100 shillings ($1) since the plastic ban,” he said, crouching to sharpen a machete at his farm. Last year Kenya passed a law aimed at reducing plastic pollution, whereby Kenyans producing, selling or even using plastic bags risk imprisonment of up to four years or fines of $40,000. Big supermarket chains like France’s Carrefour and Kenya’s Nakumatt have already started offering customers cloth bags as alternatives – creating demand for fibre like sisal, said Robert Gituru, a botanist at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology. “Farmers are taking more interest in sisal due to the growing demand for shopping bags made with plant fibre,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Sisal provides a greener alternative to plastic, “as it decomposes faster and can be recycled as farm manure,” he said. Kenya is the world’s third-biggest producer of sisal after Brazil and Tanzania, said Dickson Kibata, technical officer at the government’s Agriculture and Food Authority, and it generates about 2 billion shillings ($20 million) in annual revenue. “But that could rise to 50 billion shillings ($500 million) in the next five years if demand for sisal keeps growing,” he said. The Kenyan government is encouraging farmers to invest in the crop, Kibata said, for example by hosting a conference later this year for farmers and businessmen on alternatives to plastic - such as plant fibre. Mung’ala, who said sisal can cope with Kenya’s arid weather, used to grow only a small strip of the crop on the edge of his field. Now he has a full acre of land – one quarter of his farm – sprouting with sisal plants. “The prospects look good. I even have road sellers coming to the farm to buy my produce,” said Mung’ala, who is considering devoting half of his land to sisal farming. Back in the capital, Nairobi, it is 10am, and the shores of the Nairobi dam on the edges of Kibera slum are buzzing with activity. A group of students, volunteers, and government officials are collecting plastic and paper to help clean up the capital’s spare water reservoir, which is faced with choking pollution. “This has to stop,” said Yohana Gikara, a community worker leading a team of volunteers planting trees to rehabilitate the dam. “Without plastics our wetlands can have a pollution-free future,” he said, picking up plastic trash from a makeshift toilet. Bags made with plant fibre like sisal can help the slum battle its plastics problem, he said. However, according to Juliette Biao Koudenoukpo, the regional director of the U.N. Environment Programme (UNEP), alternatives such as sisal come at a cost. “A sisal bag costs about double the price of a plastic bag, and poor people cannot afford to buy them in bulk to minimise the cost,” said Biao. This worries Mercy Nyaga, a Nairobi housewife who does her weekly shop at the neighbourhood mall. Although she tries to re-use cloth bags, she often has to buy new ones to carry all of her groceries. “This is causing me to overspend my budget,” she said. Kibata hopes the solution to that lies in increased sisal production by farmers like Mung’ala, as that could help to cut the end-price for customers. Or, he said, supermarkets might decide to hand out free sisal bags. Dionysious Kihika Kiambi, a scientist at Kenya’s Pan Africa Christian University, said an additional factor could be to use genetically-engineered sisal seeds – that can withstand pests, for example. That could help farmers increase their yields and further accelerate the take-up of sisal in the country. ""That would also reduce the amount of polluting chemicals used to tackle pests,"" he added.

2018-06-22,"LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Electric car maker Tesla Inc’s (TSLA.O) move last week to cut 9 percent of its workforce will sharply downsize the residential solar business it bought two years ago in a controversial $2.6 billion (£1.96 billion) deal, according to three internal company documents and seven current and former Tesla solar employees. The latest cuts to the division that was once SolarCity - a sales and installation company founded by two cousins of Tesla CEO Elon Musk - include closing about a dozen installation facilities, according to internal company documents, and ending a retail partnership with Home Depot Inc (HD.N) that the current and former employees said generated about half of its sales. About 60 installation facilities remain open, according to an internal company list reviewed by Reuters. An internal company email named 14 facilities slated for closure, but the other list included only 13 of those locations. Tesla declined to comment on which sites it planned to shut down, how many employees would lose their jobs or what percentage of the solar workforce they represent. The company said that cuts to its overall energy team - including batteries to store power - were in line with the broader 9 percent staff cut. “We continue to expect that Tesla’s solar and battery business will be the same size as automotive over the long term,” the company said in a statement to Reuters. The operational closures, which have not been previously reported, raise new questions about the viability of cash-strapped Tesla’s solar business and Musk’s rationale for a merger he once called a “no brainer” - but some investors have panned as a bailout of an affiliated firm at the expense of Tesla shareholders. Before the merger, Musk had served as chairman of SolarCity’s board of directors. The installation offices that the internal email said were targeted for closure were located in California, Maryland, New Jersey, Texas, New York, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Arizona and Delaware. The company also fired dozens of solar customer service staffers at call centres in Nevada and Utah, according to the former Tesla employees, some of whom were terminated in last week’s cuts. Those employees spoke on condition of anonymity because making public comments could violate the terms of their severance packages. “It’s been a difficult few days - no one can deny this,” a Tesla manager wrote in a separate internal email, sent to customer service employees shortly after the cuts were announced. Tesla has been burning through cash as it tries to hit a target of producing 5,000 Model 3 electric sedans per week after production delays. The company faces investor pressure to turn a profit without having to tap Wall Street for additional capital. The total number of cuts to the solar workforce remained unclear. Some personnel at facilities closing down were being transferred to other sites, the current and former employees said. SolarCity employed about 15,000 people at the end of 2015 but has since cut thousands of workers. Ending the Home Depot partnership, which allowed for solar sales in about 800 stores, is part of Tesla’s larger effort to absorb SolarCity into its high-end brand and sell through 90 of its 109 U.S. retail stores and its website, the company said. “Tesla stores have some of the highest foot traffic of any retail space in the country,” Tesla said. Analysts questioned Tesla’s plans for the solar business in light of the latest cuts to staff and retail operations. “In effect they seem to be saying, ‘We have no strategy for selling solar,’” said Frank Gillett, an analyst at Forrester Research, adding that the SolarCity purchase “looks pretty awful right now.” In the first quarter of this year, Tesla installed 76 megawatts of solar systems - down from SolarCity’s more than 200 MW a quarter in early 2016, when it was the leading player in the industry. In announcing quarterly results in February, Tesla said growth in solar deployments would resume later this year. Tesla’s falling solar sales also could jeopardise the future of a joint venture with Panasonic, announced as Tesla moved to acquire SolarCity in 2016, to produce solar modules at a new factory in Buffalo, New York. Tesla has an agreement with New York state requiring the company to spend $5 billion within 10 years. If Tesla fails to meet that obligation and others, the company may be required to pay tens of millions of dollars in penalties at various milestones, could lose its lease, or be forced to write down the assets, the company told investors in a May filing. In response to questions from Reuters, Tesla said it is meeting its hiring and spending commitments for the factory. In March, a Delaware judge ruled against a Tesla motion to dismiss a lawsuit by the company’s shareholders over the SolarCity deal. The lawsuit alleged Tesla’s board of directors breached its duties to shareholders by approving the merger. SolarCity founder Lyndon Rive, who is Musk’s first cousin and left Tesla last year, did not respond to a request for comment. The move to end the longstanding Home Depot partnership blindsided many staffers because Tesla had announced an expansion of the arrangement as recently as February. GTM Research analyst Austin Perea estimated the partnership has recently accounted for about half of sales, in part because of previous Tesla moves to cut back on other sales and marketing costs. Such third-party retail partnerships are among the most expensive means of generating solar sales, according to the clean energy research firm, in part because retailers take a cut of each sale. The cost of winning a customer through a store like Home Depot can be up to $7,000 per system, according to GTM Research, compared with a national average of $4,000 per installation. Home Depot spokesman Stephen Holmes said the retailer’s relationship with Tesla would last through the end of the year, adding that Home Depot would continue a partnership with Tesla competitor Sunrun (RUN.O) in an undisclosed number of stores. Over the past year, Tesla has stepped up efforts to sell solar and batteries for energy storage in its retail stores, something Musk said last year was “a much more efficient channel for demand generation.”  At the same time, Tesla stopped door-to-door sales, once among SolarCity’s most successful means of reaching new customers, and salespeople were no longer allowed to hold local events or buy online leads, the former employees said. Such tactics are standard practice across most of the competitive residential solar industry.  The Home Depot partnership was costly but also integral to Tesla’s solar panel sales, a former employee told Reuters.  “It’s an expensive account,” the former employee said, “but it does bring in all the revenue.” Reporting by Nichola Groom in Los Angeles and Salvador Rodriquez and Kristina Cooke in San Francisco; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Brian Thevenot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/tesla-solar/exclusive-tesla-to-close-a-dozen-solar-facilities-in-nine-states-documents-idUKL1N1TM1N2,22 Jun 2018,"Electric car

2018-06-22,"(Repeats item issued earlier) By Chen Aizhu CHONGQING, China, June 21 (Reuters) - On a flattened mountaintop a two-and-half-hour drive south of Chongqing in southwest China, a fleet of towering, red fracking trucks pumps chemicals and sand into a 1,500-metre horizontal well deep under the ground. The equipment was designed and built by China’s state-owned energy major Sinopec, the result of a decades-long government drive to develop low-cost domestic technology to tap the country’s vast shale gas resources buried in the region’s mountainous terrain. It is the latest key technology that China has learned to master. Except for a handful of higher-end tools, Sinopec and a crop of independent companies make everything from trucks and pumps to drilling fluid and proppants - treated sand or man-made ceramics used to “prop” open a fracture to allow gas to escape. “We’re doing 95 percent or more of the service jobs ourselves. The amount of work handled by foreign firms is minimal,” said Shi Yuanhui, a senior Sinopec service engineer. The government-backed push, motivated in part by cost cutting amid the oil price slump of 2014, has seen international firms like oil services group Schlumberger, Halliburton or Baker Hughes scale back operations in China. Meanwhile, Chinese firms are starting to export equipment including pressure pumps, even to the home of the shale boom in the United States. Over the past 8 years, the cost of building a well has nearly halved to an average of under 50 million yuan per well ($7.8 million), and drilling speed has improved by two-thirds to 45-60 days, according to interviews with state oil officials, equipment makers and service providers. “China has over the years developed its unique practice that employs home-manufactured compact drilling equipment to suit the terrains, and improved greatly on drilling efficiency,” said Lynn Lin of energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Schlumberger and Baker Hughes declined to comment on their China shale business. Halliburton did not respond to a request for comment. State energy giants Sinopec and PetroChina pumped 9 billion cubic metres (bcm) of shale gas in 2017, up from scratch a decade ago and equivalent to about 6 percent of the country’s total natural gas production. Still, the hilltop scene illustrates some of the problems facing the world’s biggest energy consumer in exploiting its unconventional gas. Unlike the flatter U.S. regions containing shale, Chinese firms operate in tricky environments, including mountainous, arid, remote and also highly populated regions, leading to higher costs. China’s shale is also buried deeper and is more fractured, making it difficult and expensive to extract. China is expected to nearly double output to 17 bcm by 2020, according to Wood Mackenzie. While below Beijing’s 2020 target of 30 bcm, set out four years ago, and just a fraction of 474 bcm produced in the United States last year, domestic gas is a major focus as the country looks to ease its reliance on dirtier coal. China’s leading manufacturer of fracking equipment is Jianghan No.4 Machinery Plant, which accounts for more than half of the country’s production of fracking trucks and pumps. The firm, under the supervision of what was then the Ministry of Petroleum, bought several dozen U.S. fracking trucks in 1988 on condition the manufacturer allowed access to its technology, said a Jianghan marketing executive who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media. The know-how was initially applied to conventional wells before Jianghan No.4, now part of Sinopec, China’s top shale gas firm, built the country’s first shale fracker in 2012. Baoji Machinery, a unit of state-run CNPC, and independent equipment builders Honghua Group and Jereh Group have also expanded into shale, and are competing in new, more efficient electric-powered frackers. Jereh and Honghua are also leading an export push, said company officials, competing with the likes of Halliburton. Jereh exports trucks, pressure pumps and pipes, with total overseas sales making up half of its 3.2 billion yuan ($495 million) in revenue in 2017, a company spokeswoman said, declining to give a breakdown by country. Lucrative export contracts will be needed as China’s shale industry still struggles to make cash at home. Sinopec has acknowledged it would be difficult to break even without government subsidies, currently at roughly 20 percent of well-head prices. Helping increase efficiency, Chinese firms can now drill multiple wells at a single pad, known as “well factory” drilling. They can also carry out extended horizontal fracturing up to 3,000 metres, Sinopec engineers said. The expertise will be needed if China is to make the most of its shale gas, estimated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration as the world’s largest. Western majors like Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell , Total, ConocoPhillips and Chevron largely abandoned China’s shale scene after disappointing initial results. Geologists at Sinopec said they have struggled to replicate a find like Fuling, the largest commercial field, a gas field similar, but smaller, to the hugely successful U.S. Marcellus formation. There are also complaints that Sinopec’s and PetroChina’s domination is a barrier to future development, as these state behemoths hinder competition. Only in late 2017, as shale drilling quickened on the back of rising oil prices, did the two majors start awarding service contracts to independent firms like SPT Energy , Anton Oilfield and Honghua Group.

2018-06-22,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will build a railway connecting the western region of Tibet with Nepal, the China Daily reported on Friday, one of several bilateral deals signed during Nepali Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli’s visit to Beijing.  The link will connect the Tibetan city of Xigaze with Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu, the paper said.     The two sides signed more than 10 agreements involving technology, transportation, infrastructure and political cooperation, according to a notice posted on China's official government website (www.gov.cn) on Thursday. China would also like to work with Nepal to build a “cross-Himalayan connectivity network” through aviation, trading ports, highways and telecommunications, China Daily quoted Chinese Premier Li Keqiang as saying. In an interview with state-run Chinese tabloid Global Times on Friday, Oli said “cross-border connectivity” was Nepal’s top priority, and he called for the two countries to work together to develop Nepal’s hydropower resources. Nepal has already scrapped a $2.5 billion (1.89 billion pounds) deal with China’s state-owned Gezhouba Group to build a hydropower facility in the west of the country.  A $1.6 billion deal with China’s Three Gorges Project Corporation to build the West Seti hydropower plant in Nepal has also been put in doubt, with officials saying the Chinese company has been haggling for better terms.
