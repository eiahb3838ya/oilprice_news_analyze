2018-06-10,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - A storage site housing half of Baghdad’s ballot boxes from Iraq’s parliamentary election in May caught fire on Sunday, just days after parliament demanded a nationwide recount of votes, drawing calls for the election to be re-run. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi described the fire as a “plot” aimed at Iraq’s democracy. The timing of the fire undermined the results of an election whose validity was already in doubt. Fewer than 45 percent of voters cast a ballot, a record low, and allegations of fraud began almost immediately after the vote. “Burning election warehouses ... is a plot to harm the nation and its democracy. We will take all necessary measures and strike with an iron fist all who undermine the security of the nation and its citizens,” Abadi said in a statement. Experts would conduct an investigation and prepare a detailed report on how the fire started, he said. An Interior Ministry spokesman said the fire was confined to one of four warehouses at the site. State television said ballot boxes were moved to another location under heavy security. Interior Minister Qasim al-Araji later told a local television channel that “not a single box was burned.” Abadi, whose electoral alliance came third in the election, had said on Tuesday that a government investigation had found serious violations and blamed Iraq’s independent elections commission for most of them. Parliament mandated a full manual recount the next day. The Independent High Elections Commission had used electronic vote- counting devices to tally the results. A recount could undermine nationalist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, a long-time adversary of the United States whose bloc won the largest number of seats in the election. One of Sadr’s top aides expressed concern that some parties were trying to sabotage the cleric’s victory. CALLS FOR RE-RUN Salim al-Jabouri, the outgoing speaker of parliament, said the fire showed the election should be repeated. “The crime of burning ballot-box storage warehouses in the Rusafa area is a deliberate act, a planned crime, aimed at hiding instances of fraud and manipulation of votes, lying to the Iraqi people and changing their will and choices,” he said in a statement. Jabouri narrowly lost his seat in May and had been one of the strongest proponents of a recount before the fire.  Opponents of the recount, mostly those whose blocs did well in the election, point out that many who voted for it were lawmakers who lost their seat. Sadr’s bloc boycotted the parliamentary session in which the vote took place. Jabouri’s call was seconded by Vice President Iyad Allawi, the leader of the electoral alliance Jabouri ran as part of. Top Sadr aide Dhiaa al-Asadi said the fire was a plot aimed at forcing a repeat of the election and hiding fraud. “Whoever burned the election equipment and document storage site had two goals: either cancelling the election or destroying the stuffed ballots counted amongst the results,” he tweeted. The fire took place at a Trade Ministry site in Baghdad where the election commission stored the ballot boxes from al-Rusafa, the half of Baghdad on the eastern side of the Tigris river. Baghdad is Iraq’s most populous province, accounting for 71 seats out of the Iraqi parliament’s 329. The site was divided into four warehouses, said Interior Ministry spokesman Major General Saad Maan. Only one - housing electronic equipment and documents - had burned down, he said.  Firefighters stopped the fire from spreading to the remaining three warehouses, where the ballot boxes are stored, he said. The law mandating a manual recount also mandated the board of the election commission be replaced by judges. Earlier on Sunday, the Supreme Judicial Council, Iraq’s highest judicial authority, named the judges who will take over replace the commissioners.  The council also named judges to replace the commission’s local chiefs in each of Iraq’s 18 provinces, another measure mandated by parliament. The board of commissioners has said it would appeal against the law forcing the recount. Its chairman a statement late on Sunday said all of the electronic vote counting and voter identification equipment had been lost in the fire but that ballot boxes were safe. “The fire does not affect the election results,” Maan al-Hetawi said, because it had kept copies of the paper tallies produced by the vote counting devices in a separate location. “The commission today is targeted from all sides ... we call on all constitutional institutions in the country and the leaders of all political blocs to do their historic duty and preserve the results of the electoral process,” he said.

2018-06-10,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Europe will implement counter-measures against U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium just like Canada, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Sunday, voicing regret about President Donald Trump’s abrupt decision to withdraw support for a G7 communique. Trump’s announcement on Twitter, after leaving the Group of Seven summit in Canada early, that he was backing out of the joint communique torpedoed what appeared to be a fragile consensus on a trade dispute between Washington and its top allies. “The withdrawal, so to speak, via tweet is of course ... sobering and a bit depressing,” Merkel said in an ARD television interview following the G7 summit. The summit did not mark the end of the transatlantic partnership between Europe and the U.S., Merkel said. But she repeated that Europe could no longer rely on its ally and should take its fate into its own hands. Like Canada, the European Union is preparing counter-measures against U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, in line with World Trade Organisation rules, Merkel said. “So we won’t let ourselves be ripped off again and again. Instead, we act then too,” Merkel said in an unusually combative tone. Asked if she was concerned that Trump could retaliate against EU counter-measures by imposing tariffs on cars, Merkel said: “First of all, we’ll try and see if we can prevent this... And then hope that the EU will respond again in the same unity.” Merkel said the G7 leaders had agreed to review their trade ties and assess the scope of existing tariffs in order to avoid further trade barriers. The centre-right leader said a tariff-free area among G7 allies would be an ideal outcome, but she made clear that any talks about such a trade bloc would have to include non-tariff barriers to trade as well as free access to public tenders. Turning to Russia, Merkel said she could imagine Moscow re-joining the G7 format at some point, but there first had to be progress in the implementation of the peace plan for Ukraine. Russia was pushed out of what was then the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Merkel said she expected Italy’s new coalition government to vote for the extension of European sanctions against Russia. Touching the thorny issue of Germany’s relatively low defence spending, Merkel acknowledged that Trump’s criticism was partly correct and that Berlin had to do more to reach NATO’s goal of spending to 2 percent of economic output on defence. “Trump is in a way right. And that’s why we need to increase our defence spending,” Merkel said.

2018-06-10,"CAIRO (Reuters) - The leaders of Ethiopia and Egypt vowed on Sunday to iron out their differences over a dam Addis Ababa is building on the Nile River that Cairo fears threatens its water supplies. Talks over the Grand Renaissance Dam, Ethiopia’s $4 billion hydroelectric project, have been deadlocked for months. But at a press conferee in Cairo, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi signaled they had made a breakthrough. “We have come a long way in building confidence and strengthening bilateral cooperation,” Sisi said. Ahmed, speaking in his native Amharic language, said Ethiopia was committed to ensuring Egypt’s share of Nile water. “We will take care of the Nile and we will preserve your share and we will work to increase this quota and President Sisi and I will work on this,” Ahmed said, addressing Egyptians. Safeguarding Egypt’s share of the Nile, its main source of drinking water and water for industry and farming, is at the top of Sisi’s agenda as he begins his second term in office. The two sides agreed to take steps to put into effect an agreement - which also includes Sudan - to set up a fund for investing in infrastructure in the three countries. Toward the end of their news conference, Sisi asked Ahmed to swear to God before the Egyptian people that he will not hurt Egypt’s share of the Nile. “I swear to God, we will never harm you,” Ahmed repeated the words in Arabic after Sisi, who thanked him for releasing jailed Ethiopians.

2018-06-10,"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Drivers across Bosnia blocked roads on Sunday in protest against rising fuel prices, warning of knock-on increases in prices for food and other goods, state television reported. The one-hour blockade in the cities of Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Tuzla and Zenica, as well as a main regional road, had been organised on social networks, echoing similar action in neighbouring Serbia in the past few days. Kilometres-long columns of cars were formed on roads in central Bosnia, blocking drivers who were returning from weekend holidays. Fuel prices were first increased in February after a rise in biofuel excise taxes but there have been two further increases, lifting the price of a litre of gasoline to 2.35 Bosnian marka (1.20 euros). Drivers also blocked roads in major Serbian cities on Friday and Saturday, protesting against prices that have risen to 1.24 euros ($1.46) for a litre of gasoline and 1.30 euros for a litre of diesel.  Protesters said prices should be kept under 1 euro a litre in Bosnia and Serbia, where average monthly pay is about 400 euros. Drivers in both countries have said they would continue daily protests.  Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on Sunday that the protests were politically motivated, and both countries’ governments blame the higher prices on global markets, where crude oil prices have been bolstered over the past year by a supply pact led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.   Bosnia and Serbia import most of their oil products.

2018-06-10,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany and France on Sunday sharply criticised U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to abruptly withdraw his support for a Group of Seven communique, accusing him of destroying trust and acting inconsistently. Trump’s announcement on Twitter, after he left the G7 summit in Canada early, that he was backing out of the joint communique torpedoed what appeared to be a fragile consensus on a trade dispute between Washington and its top allies. Trump also took aim at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and said he might double down on import tariffs by hitting the sensitive automobile industry, throwing G7 efforts to show a united front into disarray. G7 members Germany and France said they stood by the communique despite Trump’s decision. “In a matter of seconds, you can destroy trust with 280 Twitter characters,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said when asked about Trump’s U-turn, adding it would take much longer to rebuild lost trust. Trump’s conduct was “actually not a real surprise, we have seen this with the climate agreement or the Iran deal”, Maas, a senior member of the Social Democrats (SPD), a partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition, told reporters. Trump withdrew the United States from the global deal reached in Paris in December 2015 to curb global warming, and last month from world powers’ July 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, asserting that it was one-sided in Tehran’s favour. SPD leader Andrea Nahles accused Trump of turning the G7 summit into a disaster with his tweets and bowing out of his international responsibilities. “President Trump is creating chaos. Reasonable and reliable policy is not possible that way.” France and Europe are standing by the G7 communique, a French presidency official said, adding anyone departing from the commitments made at the summit would be showing their “incoherence and inconsistency”. “International cooperation cannot depend on being angry and on sound bites. Let’s be serious,” the French official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. Trump has infuriated the European Union, Canada and Mexico by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, accusing all of having shortchanged the United States in trade deals. They strongly deny this. Trump and European allies are also at odds over Trump’s decision to pull the United States out of the deal in which Iran curbed its disputed nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief, and the Paris climate change accord. “We have to keep a cool head now and draw the right conclusions,” Maas said. Europe’s answer must be to stick even closer together, defend its interests and strengthen alliances with countries such as Japan and Canada, he said. “Europe united is the answer to America First,” Maas added. A German government spokesman also said that Berlin stands by the jointly agreed G7 communique in which leaders underlined the crucial role of a rules-based international trading system and promised to fight protectionism. In Washington, the top White House economic adviser accused Canada’s prime minister on Sunday of betraying Trump with “polarising” statements on U.S. trade policy that risked undermining the American leader on the eve of a historic summit with North Korea. Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, lashed out at Trudeau as “amateurish” and “sophomoric” for a news conference the prime minister gave after Trump left the G7 summit on Saturday. Trudeau told reporters that he had spoken of retaliatory measures that Canada would take next month in response to Trump’s decision to slap tariffs on steel and aluminium imports.

2018-06-10,"PARIS, June 10 (Reuters) - French farmers will start a blockade of oil refineries and fuel depots on Sunday evening in protest at plans by Total to use imported palm oil at a biofuel facility, a move that has fanned farmer discontent over unfair competition. At least five sites will be blocked on Sunday evening, with a total of 13 sites blocked from 9 am Monday, Christiane Lambert, president of the FNSEA farmers union told France Info television in an interview. The French authorities last month gave oil and gas major Total permission to use palm oil as one of the feedstocks at its La Mede biofuel refinery, in southern France, infuriating farmers who grow local oilseed crops like rapeseed and environmentalists who blame palm oil cultivation for deforestation in southeast Asia. The organisers say the blockade, to run for three days initially, is aimed at pressuring the government to curb palm oil use at La Mede and to address other grievances like imports of South American meat. “Our target is the state,” Lambert said, adding that Total’s decision on palm oil was “the last straw”. Fuel shortages were not expected as a result of the blockade given France’s network of emergency fuel reserves and in the absence of sympathy action by fuel sector workers. Palm oil is cheaper than rapeseed oil as a feedstock for biodiesel fuel, and French farmers say its growing use has added to their longstanding competitive disadvantage because of high taxes and strict environmental regulations in France. Total argues its refining plan involves less palm oil than allowed by the authorities, offers an outlet for local rapeseed and will develop large-scale recycling of used oil and fat. Palm oil has been widely criticised in Europe for environmental destruction and some lawmakers are pushing for a ban on its use in biofuel as part of new European Union energy targets. The issue has caused friction with Indonesia and Malaysia, the world’s two largest palm oil producers, with Malaysian officials warning of trade repercussions including in the possible purchase of French fighter jets. The refinery protests in France also illustrate a souring relationship between farmers in the EU’s biggest agricultural producer and the government of President Emmanuel Macron. Many farmers welcome the president’s call for fairer farmgate prices as part of a food chain review last year, but they have been irked by Macron’s attempt to phase out common weedkiller glyphosate before other EU countries.
