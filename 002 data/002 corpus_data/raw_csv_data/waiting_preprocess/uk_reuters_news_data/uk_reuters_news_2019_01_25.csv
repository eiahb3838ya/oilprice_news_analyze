2019-01-25,"Jan 25 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms this week increased the number of oil rigs operating for the first time this year but the rig count in January fell the most in a month since April 2016, as the boom in the Permian, the nation’s biggest shale oil formation, cools. Companies added 10 oil rigs in the week to Jan. 25, bringing the total count to 862, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI For the month, drillers cut 23 rigs in January, the most removed in a month since April 2016. Over the past two months, they pulled two rigs in December and added 12 in November. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still much higher than a year ago when 759 rigs were active after energy companies boosted spending in 2018 to capture higher prices that year. In 2019, however, drillers have said they plan to remove rigs due in part to forecasts for lower crude prices than last year. U.S. oil output from seven major shale formations is expected to rise to a record high 8.2 million barrels per day in February, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projections this week. But the EIA said it expects the increase in Permian production for February to be the smallest in a month since May 2018, when output fell slightly. Output from the Permian has come under pressure in recent months as oil prices crashed and a production surge there outpaced pipeline capacity, trapping barrels in the region. The U.S. shale boom is set to cool this year, according to Reuters columnist John Kemp. A decline in prices late last year, which usually takes three-four months to impact drilling, will likely start to slow production growth during the second half of 2019. U.S. crude futures were trading below $54 a barrel on Friday, putting the front-month on track to slip for the first week in four as surging U.S. fuel stocks and global economic woes weighed on the market. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading below $55 a barrel for the balance of 2019 and calendar 2020. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided mixed guidance for 2019 after indicating they would spend about $88.7 billion in 2018, a 23 percent increase over the $72.2 billion spent in 2017. There were 1,059 oil and natural gas rigs active in the United States this week, according to Baker Hughes. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and gas rig count will fall from 1,032 in 2018 to 999 in 2019 before rising to 1,087 in 2020. That forecast has remained unchanged in the past two weeks. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2019-01-25,"ISTANBUL, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Turkey will begin drilling for resources around Cyprus, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Friday, a move that could create tensions with neighbouring Cyprus and Greece over ownership of natural resources. Attempts to tap gas and oil in the eastern Mediterranean have caused friction between Athens and Ankara. Turkey and the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government in Cyprus have overlapping claims of jurisdiction for offshore oil and gas research in the eastern Mediterranean, a region thought to be rich in natural gas. Turkey will start drilling around Cyprus because the Greek Cypriot government did not listen to Ankara’s suggestions to ensure the rights of Turkish Cypriots, Cavusoglu said during an interview following a meeting with the Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci. “Our second platform is coming in February. We were going to send it to the Black Sea, now we are sending it to the Cyprus area,” Cavusoglu said. “Our drill ship Fatih is currently in the Alanya-1 area, its work there will be done in March. We are shifting that to the south too,” he added. He did not specify whether Turkey would drill for oil or natural gas. Turkey launched its first drill ship “Fatih” in October to drill off the coast of Turkey’s southern Antalya province and had said a second ship that it purchased would operate in the Black Sea. Breakaway north Cyprus, which is supported by Turkey, says any offshore wealth also belongs to them, as partners in the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus in 1960. Greek Cypriots, who run the island’s internationally recognised government, say any future benefits of gas finds will eventually be shared by all Cypriots. Cavusoglu said Ankara would not be satisfied by such statements. The island was split in 1974 after a Turkish invasion triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. Countless peacemaking endeavours have failed, and offshore wealth has increasingly complicated peace negotiations even though Greek Cypriots say that matter is not up for discussion.

Canadian National and rival Canadian Pacific Railway were rationing space on trains travelling in the Vancouver area and prioritized some commodities over others to deal with congestion, causing complaints from shippers. Canada is a top shipper of crops, fertilizer, oil and pulp, but has in recent years needed government intervention to keep commodities moving, as new free trade deals with European and Pacific nations drive up demand. Fluidity in Vancouver improved this month because of actions taken by CN and other companies in the supply chain, CN spokesman Jonathan Abecassis said in a statement. He was not immediately available for comment on whether CN is continuing to ration space and prioritize some commodities.

2019-01-25,"GAZA (Reuters) - Qatar on Friday said it will pay $20 million (15 million pounds) in humanitarian aid to boost the ailing economy of Gaza, a day after the coastal strip’s Palestinian rulers stopped the oil-rich Gulf state from paying money directly to impoverished government workers there. The move was widely seen as a compromise between Qatar, which appears intent on increasing its regional influence, and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which controls Gaza. Qatar’s point-man for Gaza relief efforts, Mohammed Al-Emadi, said in Gaza: “It was agreed to allocate the Qatari financial grant to pay for humanitarian projects with full cooperation and coordination with the United Nations.” He said the first agreement with the U.N. would be signed on Monday next week, setting up a $20 million job creation project. A Hamas official, Sami Abu Zuhri, on Friday welcomed Qatar’s decision to give money to humanitarian projects.  A day earlier Hamas had blocked direct Qatari payments to thousands of unpaid Palestinian civil servants in Gaza, claiming that Israel had broken agreements about how the arrangement would be carried out. The compromise follows a tortuous regional standoff that has left civil servants in Gaza caught up in a bitter power struggle between Hamas and the western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the occupied West Bank.  Hamas wants to pay the workers that it hired, but doesn’t have enough money after years of Israeli-led blockades, wars and the failure of reconciliation efforts with Abbas. Wages have been cut in half for several years, and payments were often behind schedule.     Abbas has refused to pay them, hoping that by slashing salaries, and thereby worsening economic conditions in Gaza, he can force Hamas back to the negotiating table. Israel regards Hamas as an implacable Islamist enemy, but fears that instability in Gaza will spill over into violence against Israelis. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government initially blocked the latest Qatari transfer, but relented on Thursday after the Israeli military recommended that it be allowed in. On Friday, Israeli forces shot and killed a Palestinian man during weekly protests along its border with Gaza, local health officials said.  An Israeli military spokeswoman said that about 10,000 Palestinians had amassed along the Gaza border and that some of them hurled grenades and stones toward the soldiers across the way.  “IDF (Israel Defence Forces) fighters responded by using riot dispersal means and in accordance with the rules of engagement,” the spokeswoman said. Palestinians launched weekly border protests nine months ago demanding the right of return to land from which their ancestors fled or were forced to flee during Israel’s founding in 1948 and an end to a grinding Israeli blockade of the territory, home for two million people. Another Palestinian was killed on Friday by Israeli soldiers in a separate incident in the West Bank, the Palestinian Health Ministry said.  The Israeli military said its troops had opened fire at three Palestinian suspects who were throwing stones at Israeli vehicles driving along a West Bank highway and that after receiving medical treatment, one of the suspects died.

No changes to text) BRUSSELS/RIYADH, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The European Commission has added Saudi Arabia to an EU draft list of countries that pose a threat to the bloc because of lax controls against terrorism financing and money laundering, two sources told Reuters on Friday. The move comes amid heightened international pressure on Saudi Arabia after the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate on Oct. 2. The EU’s list currently consists of 16 countries, including Iran, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen and North Korea, and is mostly based on criteria used by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global body composed by wealthy nations meant to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. But the list has been updated this week, using new criteria developed by the EU Commission since 2017. Saudi Arabia is one of the countries added to the updated list which is still confidential, one EU source and one Saudi source told Reuters. Saudi authorities did not immediately respond to request for comment. The move is a setback for Riyadh at a time when it is striving to bolster its international reputation in order to encourage foreign investors to participate in a huge transformation plan and improve financial ties for its banks. Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post and a critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed and dismembered by Saudi agents at its Istanbul consulate on Oct 2, provoking widespread revulsion and damaging the kingdom’s image. Apart from reputational damages, the inclusion in the list complicates financial relations with the EU. The bloc’s banks will have to carry out additional checks on payments involving entities from listed jurisdictions. The provisional decision needs to be endorsed by the 28 EU states before being formally adopted next week. A second EU official said other countries are likely to be added to the final list but declined to elaborate as the information is still confidential and subject to changes. An EU commission spokesman said he had no comment on the content of the list as it had not been finalised yet. Countries are blacklisted if they “have strategic deficiencies in their anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism regimes that pose significant threats to the financial system of the Union,” the existing EU list says. Under the new EU methodology, jurisdictions could also be blacklisted if they do not provide sufficient information on ownership of companies or if their rules on reporting suspicious transactions or monitoring financial customers are considered too lax. Saudi Arabia missed out on gaining full FATF membership in September after it was determined to fall short in combating money laundering and terror financing. The government has taken steps to beef up its efforts to tackle graft and abuse of power, but FATF said in September that Riyadh was not effectively investigating and prosecuting individuals involved in larger scale money laundering activity or confiscating the proceeds of crime at home or abroad. The EU has reviewed 47 jurisdictions, including the United States, Russia and Switzerland, before updating its list. EU countries were not screened.

Spot prices for March delivery to Asia LNG-AS this week dropped to around $8.00 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), down 20 cents from the previous week, trade sources said. Lacklustre Chinese demand was illustrated by China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) reselling a spare cargo on board the Neo Energy tanker that had loaded in November and had been kept offshore in case of a surge in consumption. CNOOC is offering out the Neo Energy, as well as the Hoegh Esperanza, which it used as a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) this winter, shipbrokers said. This is another sign of China’s weak demand. Some market players continue to reschedule deliveries to Asian buyers, with one source saying a cargo was pushed back to November from March. Supply offers are ample. Trading house Trafigura and energy major Shell offered March cargoes in Asia at $8.00-8.20/MMbtu in the Platts window, but had to lower offers to $7.75-7.85/MMbtu due to a lack of interest. No transactions took place by the time of publication. Outages at Australia’s Gorgon plant and Indonesia’s Bontang did not help prices to firm. At Bontang, where a train is offline until next week, Pertamina indicated it may require a vessel to load a cargo in mid-February, signalling production is stable, shipbrokers said. Indonesia’s Donggi Senoro LNG is selling two March cargoes in a tender closing Jan. 30, according to the Platts window. In the Atlantic basin, Angola LNG offered a February cargo in a tender, while India’s Gail offered six cargoes for 2020 from its offtake from U.S. Sabine Pass and Cove Point in two tenders that closed this week. Falling Asian prices coupled with robust European gas hub prices, used as benchmarks for LNG trades, have led to an influx of cargoes to Europe, now the largest buyer of U.S. LNG. But even here, LNG prices are falling, with two traders saying spot cargoes are now heard at discounts to British and Dutch natural gas prices , against which they are normally at premium. “Europe is at discount over indexes ... Even Spain is coming flat to TTF (the Dutch gas hub price),” one European-based trade source said. A U.S. cargo was sold to Spain for delivery in late February below the Dutch gas benchmark, another trader said. Another U.S. cargo is on offer for March delivery to Europe. Demand also came from Mexico’s CFE which required two cargoes for February delivery. Charter rates for vessels with modern propulsion dropped to $60,000s per day this week, a half of where the rates were in late December, and are expected to keep falling as more vessels becoming available, shipbrokers said.

2019-01-25,"MEXICO CITY, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Mexico said on Friday that it is willing to mediate between the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and opposition leader and congress chief Juan Guaido, if both sides request and agree to it. Guaido declared himself interim leader on Wednesday, with Washington and most Latin American nations backing the move. But Mexico - once a vocal member of the Lima Group regional bloc created to pressure Maduro to enact democratic reforms - struck a discordant tone. Leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s government said it would not take sides and branded support for Guaido a violation of sovereignty. “Let both sides ask for it. We’re willing to help in the mediation ... we can’t do so just because one of the sides proposes it and says here we are,” Lopez Obrador told journalists. “If they come to an agreement and really want dialogue, to find a peaceful solution, our country as it has done in the past on issues of foreign policy would again serve as a mediator,” he added during his daily press conference. Socialist Maduro said he supported proposals by Mexico and Uruguay to “create an international initiative for dialogue between the political forces in Venezuela, to seek an agreement within the framework of our Constitution, which guarantees stability and peace to all Venezuelans.” Maduro, who has led the oil-rich nation since 2013 and was re-elected last year in an election largely seen as a sham, severed diplomatic ties with the United States earlier this week. Some U.S. diplomats left the Caracas embassy for the airport on Friday.

2019-01-25,"PARIS (Reuters) - France plans to double its renewable energy capacity with a system of regular tenders under a draft 10-year energy strategy plan published on Friday.  The so-called PPE plan, which lays out capacity targets for various energy sectors over the 2019-2023 and 2024-28 periods, also confirmed that four to six nuclear reactors - including two in Fessenheim - will be closed by 2028, as announced late last year.  France aims to boost electrical renewable energy capacity - including hydropower - from 48.6 gigawatt (GW) end 2017 to 74 GW in 2023 and 113 GW in 2028, mainly by boosting wind and solar. Through regular tenders, onshore wind installed capacity will be more than doubled from 13.5 GW at the end of 2017 to about 25 GW in 2023 and about 35 GW in 2028. Offshore wind capacity will rise from zero today to 2.4 GW in 2023 and about 5 GW in 2028, while solar capacity is set to grow from 7.7 GW at the end of 2017 to 21 GW in 2023 and about 40 GW in 2028.  Hydro capacity will increase marginally from 25.3 GW end 2017 to about 26.6 in 2028.  In fixed-foundation offshore wind, the government plans tenders for 500 megawatt (MW) this year at a price of less than 70 euros per megawatt hour, 1,000 MW in 2020 at 65 MWh and 1,000 to 1,500 MW at 60 MWh in 2023-24.  It also wants to kick of floating offshore wind with a first tender for 250 MW at 120 euros per MWh in 2021, followed by 250 MW in 2022 and 250 to 500 MW in 2024.

The calculations are a blow for the government, which is already struggling to generate support for measures needed to reach its ultimate goal of halving CO2 emissions by 2030 and banning them by 2050. The government said in October that it would implement the court order. In recent days, however, politicians have expressed doubt about the expensive and often unpopular measures that would be needed to do so at such short notice. “It’s complicated,” Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters on Friday. “We will take it step by step, to make sure our measures are well supported. The task is big, but the aim is to reach the goal.” Plans to reach the 2020 goal will be presented in April, Rutte said, around the time the government is due to decide how to reach the targets set in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Uncertainty over the cost of meeting those goals has put Rutte’s government under pressure, less than two months before elections that could cost the coalition its majority in the Upper House. The court order to step up the fight against climate change has increased pressure on the government to close immediately at least two of five coal-fired energy plants. Current plans call for two to be shut in 2024 and the other three by 2030. Shutting two immediately would cost hundreds of millions of euros and deliver just half of the CO2 reduction required. Further savings would need to come from energy-saving measures such as lowering speed limits, improving home insulation and raising energy prices, experts have said. “Closing the coal plants is the most obvious option”, ABN Amro energy expert Hans van Cleef said. “Another option is to buy emission rights abroad. But that will be a hard sell politically, as it doesn’t reduce emissions in the Netherlands.”  Reporting by Bart Meijer; Editing by Dale Hudson and Jason Neely",https://uk.reuters.com/article/climatechange-netherlands/update-1-dutch-need-drastic-measures-to-reach-2020-climate-goals-idUKL8N1ZP325,25 Jan 2019,"The Dutch government is

2019-01-25,"ROTTERDAM (Reuters) - As Daan Hosli’s hybrid BMW glides into downtown Rotterdam, it passes a virtual boundary into the city’s “electric-only zone” and his mobile phone trills out a reminder to switch off his combustion engine and drive on battery power. Hosli is taking part in Electric City Drive, one in a series of projects planned by the city of Rotterdam and BMW looking to cut greenhouse gas emissions and reduce traffic pollution - without breaking the bank. “The first results look promising,” said Arno Bonte, the city’s vice mayor, who oversees energy policies. “I hope we can extend this project as soon as possible, also to owners of cars by other brands.” Participants have a smartphone app, developed by BMW, which monitors their engine usage and reminds them to switch, voluntarily, to electric driving when they hit a geo-fence. Costs to the city, Bonte said, are nil. Initial results show participants are willing to use battery power exclusively while in the zone about 90 percent of the time. The Netherlands is an outlier in Europe with relatively more hybrids than electric vehicles, 100,000 versus 40,000 - together still just a small fraction of the 8.1 million vehicles on the country’s roads. But “if you really want to make a difference now, you have to look at hybrids,” said BMW Netherlands CEO Stefanie Wurst. That is because, with European cities struggling to meet dual goals of improving air quality and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from cars by 30 percent by 2030, they need practical ways of making progress quickly, rather than holding out for a distant - and costly - entirely electric car future.  And it’s not proving easy. German cities are angering diesel car owners by banning high-polluting vehicles from some of their streets, while French plans for a fossil fuel surcharge set off the “yellow vests” street protests. Even in wealthy Norway, which leads the world in electric car adoption, Oslo is introducing fees for charging and looking at ways to avoid expensive grid upgrades. “Positive stimulation is always better than negative sanctions,” Wurst said.   She said Rotterdam program participants had responded well to small rewards, such as a discount pass for local attractions, as well as from the simple reminder to switch.  A financial incentive to run hybrids on electricity is theoretically built in, as electricity is cheaper than petrol per kilometer traveled. Vice Mayor Bonte says Rotterdam views hybrids as a bridge to mass adoption of electric vehicles sometime in the mid 2020s as prices fall and charging infrastructure improves.      The city has granted a charging station concession to Engie, with the French company agreeing to install one public charging pole for each electric or hybrid vehicle owner that requests one - 4,000 so far, in a city of 600,000 people, though there are more in private buildings and parking garages. But there’s a long way to go. According to EV-Volumes.com, a data provider which culls information from national registries, the number of vehicles capable of driving on electric engines across Europe grew by 33 percent in 2018, split between 181,000 plug in hybrid vehicles and 230,000 electric-only vehicles - together making up about 1.5 percent of total new car sales. In Rotterdam, Hosli says he enjoys the challenge of trying to find charging stations and using up his electric battery as often as he can. Statistics on his app show he uses about 4 liters of petrol per 100 kilometers of travel. “I have to drive for work, I can’t avoid that, for me this is just a fun way to do it,” said the real estate developer. “It’s like a sport for me, to fill up with gas as little as possible.” Reporting by Toby Sterling; Editing by Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/autos-climatechange-rotterdam-bmw/seeking-thrifty-ways-to-cut-pollution-rotterdam-links-up-with-hybrid-bmw-owners-idUKL8N1ZO6TI,25 Jan 2019,"As Daan Hosli's hybrid BMW

2019-01-25,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Swedish state-owned utility Vattenfall [VATN.UL] is looking for acquisitions in its efforts to become one of Europe’s biggest operators of electric vehicle charging stations, its chief executive said. Vattenfall currently operates more than 10,000 charging spots across Europe, most of which are in its home market and in the Netherlands, joining a large number of utility rivals that all hope to benefit from an expected rise in electric car sales. In Germany, where the group makes more than a third of its underlying profit and has more than 3.6 million customers, the number of charging points stands at just 110, far behind local rivals Innogy (IGY.DE) and EnBW (EBKG.DE). “What we are looking for are strategic, reasonable acquisitions that can really push us into a growth platform or a technology that we need,” Magnus Hall told Reuters at the annual Handelsblatt energy conference. “We’re not talking about bolt-on acquisitions.” “From a financial viewpoint we are quite solid,” he said, declining to say how much cash the company had to spend. Vattenfall, which already cooperates with BMW (BMWG.DE) and Geely-owned (0175.HK) Volvo in the area of electric charging, is also looking for further partnerships with carmakers, Hall said. Vattenfall in 2016 agreed to sell its lignite operations in Germany as part of a strategic shift that will fully wean the group off CO2 emissions within a generation. Still, the company operates a number of hard coal-fired power plants in the country, most notably its 1,654 megawatt Moorburg station. Moorburg, which cost nearly 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion)and only started operations in 2015, will likely face early closure as part of a plan to phase out coal in Germany, details of which are expected later on Friday. “We think our Moorburg plant should clearly qualify for the very last step of the phase out. It’s brand new and very efficient,” Hall said, adding Vattenfall was considering fuel-switch options for the plant, including biomass. Experts believe that Germany, already in the process of shutting down all its nuclear power stations, will completely phase out of coal between 2035 and 2040. Vattenfall initially hoped to keep Moorburg running for about 40 years, Hall said.

The dollar index fell, however, from the previous day’s three-week highs, as traders eyed next week’s Federal Reserve policy meeting when it is expected to leave interest rates unchanged. The U.S. Senate was seeking a compromise Friday as hundreds of thousands of federal workers missed a second paycheck, intensifying concerns about a resulting economic impact. After causing the impasse over a fight about funding for a border wall, President Donald Trump suggested on Thursday that he could be open to a “a pro-rated down payment for the wall.” “That signals an openness and willingness to compromise. It signals that we could see an open government as soon as Monday. There’s real pressure mounting on the White House at this point,” said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist of Bruderman Asset Management in New York. “That gives investors hope. Earnings data has been strong. Economic data has not been bad and so what’s kept a lid on stocks is the political shutdown.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 228.62 points, or 0.93 percent, to 24,781.86, the S&P 500 gained 25.04 points, or 0.95 percent, to 2,667.37 and the Nasdaq Composite added 89.21 points, or 1.26 percent, to 7,162.67. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.61 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.05 percent after touching its highest point since early December. However, not all investors were optimistic as some turned to gold, often seen as safe-haven bet. Spot gold added 1.4 percent to $1,298.39 an ounce, helped by the dollar decline. In currency, the euro rebounded against the dollar after falling to its lowest level in six weeks Thursday when European Central Bank President Mario Draghi did not alter a downbeat assessment on the euro zone’s economy. The euro was up 0.91 percent to $1.1408. According to the latest Reuters polls of hundreds of economists from around the world, a synchronised global economic slowdown is under way and any escalation in the U.S.-China trade war would trigger a sharper downturn. In a note to clients, UBS Global Wealth Management’s Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele said that rhetoric on U.S.-China trade has become more positive, and that Beijing has taken steps to stimulate its economy. “While economic and earnings growth is slowing, we believe it is unlikely that growth will drop far below trend,” he said. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on Jan. 30 and 31 for the next round of trade negotiations with Washington. The British pound was up 0.8 percent after The Sun newspaper reported on Thursday that Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party has privately decided to back UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal next week if it includes a clear time limit to the Irish backstop. In U.S. Treasuries, 10-year yields bounced from a one-week low as looming Treasury supply next week and caution ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting and the government’s payrolls report added upward pressure. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 8/32 in price to yield 2.7405 percent, from 2.712 percent late on Thursday.

2019-01-25,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher on Friday as political turmoil in Venezuela threatened to tighten crude supply, but concerns over surging U.S. fuel stocks and global economic woes weighed on sentiment. The United States signaled on Thursday it may impose sanctions on Venezuelan exports after recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president this week, prompting President Nicholas Maduro to cut ties with Washington. But the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute and broader gloom over world economic growth put a check on prices. Brent crude oil futures ended the session at $61.64 a barrel, up 55 cents, or 0.9 percent. Brent, however, has shed about 1.7 percent since the start of trade on Monday and is on track to post its first week of losses in four weeks. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled at $53.69 per barrel, up 56 cents, or 1.05 percent. WTI futures fell about 0.2 percent on the week, also posting the first week of declines in four weeks.  RBC Europe predicted that U.S. sanctions could nearly double projected output shortfalls from Venezuela. “Venezuelan production will decline by an additional 300,000-500,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year, but such punitive measures could expand that outage by several hundred thousand barrels,” it said. Still, some analysts said the possibility of immediate sanctions were unlikely. “We view a blockade on Venezuelan imports as low probability and a last resort measure that is likely weeks if not months away should it materialize,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note.  “The evolving situation in Venezuela appears capable of delaying our expected test of $50 support.” Global oil markets are still well supplied, however, thanks in part to a spike in U.S. output. Record U.S. production would likely offset any short-term disruptions to Venezuelan supply due to possible U.S. sanctions, Britain’s Barclays said in a note. The bank cut its 2019 average Brent forecast to $70 a barrel, from $72 previously. U.S. energy firms this week increased the number of oil rigs operating for the first time this year. Drillers added 10 oil rigs in the week to Jan. 25, bringing the total count to 862, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday.  The output surge has swollen U.S. fuel stocks, and crude inventories rose by 8 million barrels last week, according to official data released on Thursday. Refining profits for gasoline are crashing around the world as consumption stalls amid a huge wave of new supplies, resulting in record inventories in Asia, America and Europe. In the U.S. market, gasoline margins sank to $5.70 per barrel on Thursday, the lowest seasonally since 2009, weighed down by weak demand for the fuel and excess supply. Analysts have predicted a more balanced market due to a production cut pact by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies including Russia, as well as potential export disruptions in Venezuela, Iran and Libya. “While the current state of affairs is price constructive for oil, the market is hesitant when it comes to the global outlook,” Harry Tchilinguirian, global head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas, told the Reuters Global Oil Forum. Demand may start to stutter because of a global economic slowdown, which is likely to dent fuel consumption. A trade dispute between the United States and China and tightening financial conditions around the world have hurt manufacturing activity in most economies, including in China, where growth last year was the weakest in nearly 30 years. According to Reuters polls of hundreds of economists worldwide, a synchronized global economic slowdown is underway and would deepen if the U.S.-China trade war escalated.

2019-01-25,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari suspended the country’s most senior judge on Friday weeks ahead of a presidential election, in what his challenger called an act of dictatorship and the bar association called an “attempted coup”.  Buhari, who was a military ruler in the 1980s and was voted into office in 2015, is seeking a fresh term in an election scheduled to take place on Feb. 16. The chief justice could preside over a dispute over the election result. Nigeria’s judiciary has helped resolve electoral disputes in past votes, some of which have been marred by violence and vote rigging. Chief Justice Walter Onnoghen has been asked to appear before a tribunal over allegations of breaching asset-declaration rules. He has not responded to the charges and his lawyers say the tribunal does not have the authority to try him.  Under Nigerian law, state officials must declare their assets before taking office and after they leave.  “With the directive of the CCT (Code of Conduct Tribunal) in a letter dated 23rd January, 2019, accordingly, I hereby suspend Hon Justice Walter Nkanu Samuel Onnoghen as the Chief Justice of Nigeria until the final determination of the case against him,” Buhari said. In a later tweet, the president said security agencies had traced “suspicious transactions running into millions of dollars to the CJN’s personal accounts, all undeclared or improperly declared as required by law”. He gave no further details. CJN refers to the chief justice of Nigeria. A media aide to Onnoghen did not respond to phone calls and text messages seeking comment.  Tanko Mohammed, a judge from the northeastern state of Bauchi, was named as the chief justice’s acting replacement.  On Thursday, an appeals court had issued an interim order to halt charges being brought against the chief justice. Buhari’s main challenger in the presidential vote, former vice president Atiku Abubakar, candidate for the main opposition People’s Democratic Party, issued a statement titled: “The purported suspension of CJN Onnoghen is an act of dictatorship taken too far.” “(I) call on Justice Onnoghen and the judiciary to resist with every legal and constitutional means that they can muster,” he said. “This act of desperation is geared towards affecting the outcome of the 2019 Presidential elections,” said Atiku. The Nigerian Bar Association, in a statement, said it “unequivocally rejects and condemns this attempted coup against the Nigerian judiciary and evident suspension of the Nigerian constitution”.  “The action of the executive portends a slide into anarchy and complete deconstruction of the Rule of Law and due process,” it said in the statement. It urged a reversal of the suspension and called on parliament to assert its “constitutional authority” to intervene.

2019-01-25,"* Maduro says to defend U.S. refiner Citgo as Venezuelan property * Citgo board retreats to Bahamas to plan legal moves * Citgo strategy to avoid U.S. attempts to divert revenues * PDVSA unit Citgo is biggest U.S. importer of Venezuelan crude By Marianna Parraga and Corina Pons MEXICO CITY/CARACAS, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s most important foreign asset, its $10 billion U.S. refining arm Citgo Petroleum, is hunkering down to arm itself with a legal strategy to block efforts for its board to be removed and its revenues diverted to an opposition government, sources close to the talks said. Juan Guaido, the head of the opposition-controlled congress who proclaimed himself president this week, is considering naming a new team to lead Citgo, two sources told Reuters. But President Nicolas Maduro said in Caracas on Friday that his government would seek to defend the refiner, raising the prospect that Citgo could become a battleground between the two claimants to the leadership of Venezuela. “Citgo is the property of the Venezuelan state,” Maduro said, adding that the OPEC-member country plans to continue selling oil to the United States, its first destination for crude exports and state-run PDVSA’s largest source of cash. The United States led numerous other Western Hemisphere nations in recognizing Guaido as president of Venezuela this week. The White House has been exploring ways to redirect oil revenues to the opposition, but the path to engineering such a move is unclear. Citgo is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, but it has not been able to send its revenues, in the form of dividends, to Venezuela due to U.S. sanctions. The company’s 750,000-barrel-per-day refining network is the biggest U.S. importer of Venezuelan crude. Run by appointees of Maduro, Citgo’s board earlier this week traveled to the Bahamas, where a company office was installed last year. It will seek legal avenues for the team to continue leading the firm, two company sources said. Citgo President Asdrubal Chavez has been called to meetings in Caracas, according to those sources. He is the cousin of late President Hugo Chavez, who preceded Maduro. A Citgo vice president separately traveled to Washington this week for talks on the company’s future, the sources added. “Citgo is registered in Delaware. It belongs to Venezuela, which now has two presidents. The United States only recognizes one, but that is not the one who appointed people at Citgo’s board,” one of the sources said, explaining the legal challenges. A spokeswoman at Houston-based Citgo said executives were not being made available for interviews at this time. A Venezuelan opposition source familiar with Guaido’s plans said the goal of the Citgo effort was to “raise funds,” adding that “we have to show that we’ve got resources. It’s a sign of the pressure that we’re putting on (Maduro).” Guaido is also considering making a request for funds from international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, sources said. Another source close to Guaido’s team said the group aims to minimize what they consider Maduro’s “usurpation of the Republic’s funds.” The White House earlier this month resumed talks with U.S. oil firms to explore new sanctions on Venezuela, including an embargo on Venezuelan crude sales to the United States and a prohibition on U.S. firms exporting fuels to the South American country. The White House has resisted imposing an embargo on imports from Venezuela, in part because of opposition from U.S. refiners strapped for supply of heavy crude oil. U.S. refiners currently import about 500,000 barrels of oil daily from Venezuela. Much of the demand comes from complex refiners on the Gulf Coast that use the crude to make high-margin products like diesel. Reporting by Marianna Parraga in Mexico City and Corina Pons

Prodeco said there were officials from the ministry present as voting took place. Only three of the 115 workers at the Puerto Nuevo port are members of the union - Sintracarbon - which called for the vote over a pay and benefits dispute, but eight workers voted on the potential action.

2019-01-25,"(Reuters) - Venezuela’s oil exports to the United States remain the primary cash resource for its state-owned oil company, and efforts by the United States to cut off that revenue would likely force it to send crude to China, India or other Asian countries. U.S. refineries that depend on Venezuela’s heavy crude would have even more trouble securing supplies as Canadian and Mexican crude are often not as discounted and are limited in availability. The United States has considered moves to cripple Venezuela’s oil shipments, which account for nearly all of the country’s exports, in response to the reelection of socialist President Nicolas Maduro, a vote that was widely viewed as a sham. However, it has not yet taken that step, nor has it elected to cut off supply of U.S. oil that goes to Mexico. Washington has recognised opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s head of state. Guaido is considering naming a board to state-run PDVSA’s U.S. subsidiary, Citgo Petroleum, in a gambit to generate revenue for the opposition. Venezuela, on average, exported about 500,000 barrels of crude a day to the United States in 2018, according to U.S. Energy Department data. The U.S. share of its exports has declined in recent years, with more shipments going to Russia and China.  [GRAPHIC: Venezuelan crude exports to the United States: tmsnrt.rs/2S4YIXB] Those deliveries are being made largely through oil-for-debt repayment structures as output from Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., known as PDVSA, has slumped to near 70-year lows during a nationwide economic crisis. Venezuela’s output has been cut in half since 2016 to less than 1.2 million bpd, according to figures from OPEC secondary sources. Shipments to the United States account for about 75 percent of the cash Venezuela gets for crude shipments, according to a Barclays research note published last week. The primary importers of Venezuelan crude are Citgo, Valero Energy, and Chevron. The country could seek additional deals with Turkey, India or other Asian nations. Gas Energy, a Caracas-based consultancy, said in a report that India was the second-largest importer of Venezuelan crude in November. “While Venezuela will be hard hit the first month, they will find some market for their crude,” said Diego Moya Ocampos, principal Americas analyst in country risk at IHS Markit.  [GRAPHIC: Top U.S. importers of Venezuelan crude: tmsnrt.rs/2RYGk2E] Though the United States produces nearly 12 million barrels of oil a day, complex Gulf Coast refineries need heavier crude grades to produce diesel and other high-margin products, and cannot simply sub in light crude. Prices of heavier U.S. grades like Mars Sour, an offshore medium U.S. crude, and Heavy Louisiana Sweet crude have risen as buyers scramble for supply. Mars traded at a $7.10 premium to U.S. crude on Thursday, a five-year high, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, as bidders came into the market to secure supplies through the second quarter, traders said. “It would make a tight market even tighter. If it happens, it would be an unambiguous headwind for refiners already struggling to find supplies,” said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, an energy consultancy in Bethesda, Maryland.  [GRAPHIC: Venezuelan crude exports to U.S. refiners: tmsnrt.rs/2S42EI5.] Traders said the United States may need to sell oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to cover supply shortfalls as additional shipments are secured via Canada or Mexico. Sanctions could also include U.S. exports of petroleum products to Venezuela that are used for blending with Venezuelan heavy crude.

2019-01-25,"PARIS (Reuters) - France is ready to provide 7 to 9 billion euros ($8-10 billion)  of subsidies for renewable gas but only if the industry can substantially lower its costs, the government said on Friday. Produced from methanisation of agricultural and other biological waste, biogas still costs about four times more than natural gas imported by pipeline or LNG tankers from countries like Russia, Norway, Algeria or Qatar. Under its draft “PPE” 10-year energy plan, the government set a target for biogas to account for seven to 10 percent of gas consumption by 2030 from well below one percent today if costs can fall rapidly.  Gas grid operator GRTgaz said in a statement the draft PPE was worrying for the outlook of the nascent biomethane industry.  It said a goal to reduce costs to 67 euros per MWh by 2023 was way too ambitious. Current tariffs are around 90-95 euros per MWh. “No other renewable energy sector that is mature today has seen its development conditional on such terms,” GRTgaz said.  It said the PPE did not account for the fact that biogas is non-intermittent, can easily be stored, helps deal with waste and provides income for farmers.  “As it is, the PPE trajectory threatens the development of this young industry,” GRTgaz said.  Through a system of tenders, the government wants to boost the amount of biogas produced in France from 5.4 terawatt hour in 2016, to 14 TWh in 2023 and 24 to 32 TWh in 2028. It also wants to boost the amount of biogas injected in the gas grid from virtually nothing today to more than half of production.  Although France is way behind biogas pioneers like Denmark and Germany, the sector is growing quickly. The amount of biogas injected in GRTgaz’ pipelines rose 75 percent to 714 GWh last year. Installed capacity is 1.2 TWh at 76 sites, and there is a pipeline of 661 new projects for a total capacity of 14 TWh.  A year ago, French utility Engie's CEO Isabelle Kocher said biogas has the potential to grow from about one percent of gas consumption in France to 10 percent by 2025, 30 percent by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050. reut.rs/2sJwmUw Over the next decade, the government wants to reduce total French gas consumption from 493 TWh in 2017 to about 420 THh in 2028 through energy savings and better insulation.

2019-01-25,"(Reuters) - U.S. energy firms this week increased the number of oil rigs operating for the first time this year but the rig count in January fell the most in a month since April 2016, as the boom in the Permian, the nation’s biggest shale oil formation, cools.  Drillers added 10 oil rigs in the week to Jan. 25, bringing the total count to 862, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday.                         More than half the total U.S. oil rigs are in the Permian where active units rose by three this week to 484, well short of a near four-year high of 493 in November. For the month, drillers cut 23 rigs in January, the most removed in a month since April 2016. Over the past two months, they pulled two rigs in December and added 12 in November. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still much higher than a year ago when 759 rigs were active after energy companies boosted spending in 2018 to capture higher prices that year. In 2019, however, drillers have said they plan to remove rigs due in part to forecasts for lower crude prices than last year. U.S. oil output from seven major shale formations is expected to rise to a record high 8.2 million barrels per day in February, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projections this week. But the EIA said it expects the increase in Permian production for February to be the smallest in a month since May 2018, when output fell slightly. Output from the Permian has come under pressure in recent months as oil prices crashed and a production surge there outpaced pipeline capacity, trapping barrels in the region. The U.S. shale boom is set to cool this year, according to Reuters columnist John Kemp. A decline in prices late last year, which usually takes three-four months to impact drilling, will likely start to slow production growth during the second half of 2019. U.S. crude futures were trading below $54 a barrel on Friday, putting the front-month on track to slip for the first week in four as surging U.S. fuel stocks and global economic woes weighed on the market.  Looking ahead, crude futures were trading below $55 a barrel for the balance of 2019 and calendar 2020.

2019-01-25,"ISTANBUL, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Turkey will begin drilling for resources around Cyprus, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Friday, a move that could create tensions with neighbouring Cyprus and Greece over ownership of natural resources. Attempts to tap gas and oil in the eastern Mediterranean have caused friction between Athens and Ankara. Turkey and the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government in Cyprus have overlapping claims of jurisdiction for offshore oil and gas research in the eastern Mediterranean, a region thought to be rich in natural gas. Turkey will start drilling around Cyprus because the Greek Cypriot government did not listen to Ankara’s suggestions to ensure the rights of Turkish Cypriots, Cavusoglu said during an interview following a meeting with the Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci. “Our second platform is coming in February. We were going to send it to the Black Sea, now we are sending it to the Cyprus area,” Cavusoglu said. “Our drill ship Fatih is currently in the Alanya-1 area, its work there will be done in March. We are shifting that to the south too,” he added. He did not specify whether Turkey would drill for oil or natural gas. Turkey launched its first drill ship “Fatih” in October to drill off the coast of Turkey’s southern Antalya province and had said a second ship that it purchased would operate in the Black Sea. Breakaway north Cyprus, which is supported by Turkey, says any offshore wealth also belongs to them, as partners in the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus in 1960. Greek Cypriots, who run the island’s internationally recognised government, say any future benefits of gas finds will eventually be shared by all Cypriots. Cavusoglu said Ankara would not be satisfied by such statements. The island was split in 1974 after a Turkish invasion triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. Countless peacemaking endeavours have failed, and offshore wealth has increasingly complicated peace negotiations even though Greek Cypriots say that matter is not up for discussion.

Canadian National and rival Canadian Pacific Railway were rationing space on trains travelling in the Vancouver area and prioritized some commodities over others to deal with congestion, causing complaints from shippers. Canada is a top shipper of crops, fertilizer, oil and pulp, but has in recent years needed government intervention to keep commodities moving, as new free trade deals with European and Pacific nations drive up demand. Fluidity in Vancouver improved this month because of actions taken by CN and other companies in the supply chain, CN spokesman Jonathan Abecassis said in a statement. He was not immediately available for comment on whether CN is continuing to ration space and prioritize some commodities.

2019-01-25,"GAZA (Reuters) - Qatar on Friday said it will pay $20 million (15 million pounds) in humanitarian aid to boost the ailing economy of Gaza, a day after the coastal strip’s Palestinian rulers stopped the oil-rich Gulf state from paying money directly to impoverished government workers there. The move was widely seen as a compromise between Qatar, which appears intent on increasing its regional influence, and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which controls Gaza. Qatar’s point-man for Gaza relief efforts, Mohammed Al-Emadi, said in Gaza: “It was agreed to allocate the Qatari financial grant to pay for humanitarian projects with full cooperation and coordination with the United Nations.” He said the first agreement with the U.N. would be signed on Monday next week, setting up a $20 million job creation project. A Hamas official, Sami Abu Zuhri, on Friday welcomed Qatar’s decision to give money to humanitarian projects.  A day earlier Hamas had blocked direct Qatari payments to thousands of unpaid Palestinian civil servants in Gaza, claiming that Israel had broken agreements about how the arrangement would be carried out. The compromise follows a tortuous regional standoff that has left civil servants in Gaza caught up in a bitter power struggle between Hamas and the western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the occupied West Bank.  Hamas wants to pay the workers that it hired, but doesn’t have enough money after years of Israeli-led blockades, wars and the failure of reconciliation efforts with Abbas. Wages have been cut in half for several years, and payments were often behind schedule.     Abbas has refused to pay them, hoping that by slashing salaries, and thereby worsening economic conditions in Gaza, he can force Hamas back to the negotiating table. Israel regards Hamas as an implacable Islamist enemy, but fears that instability in Gaza will spill over into violence against Israelis. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government initially blocked the latest Qatari transfer, but relented on Thursday after the Israeli military recommended that it be allowed in. On Friday, Israeli forces shot and killed a Palestinian man during weekly protests along its border with Gaza, local health officials said.  An Israeli military spokeswoman said that about 10,000 Palestinians had amassed along the Gaza border and that some of them hurled grenades and stones toward the soldiers across the way.  “IDF (Israel Defence Forces) fighters responded by using riot dispersal means and in accordance with the rules of engagement,” the spokeswoman said. Palestinians launched weekly border protests nine months ago demanding the right of return to land from which their ancestors fled or were forced to flee during Israel’s founding in 1948 and an end to a grinding Israeli blockade of the territory, home for two million people. Another Palestinian was killed on Friday by Israeli soldiers in a separate incident in the West Bank, the Palestinian Health Ministry said.  The Israeli military said its troops had opened fire at three Palestinian suspects who were throwing stones at Israeli vehicles driving along a West Bank highway and that after receiving medical treatment, one of the suspects died.

No changes to text) BRUSSELS/RIYADH, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The European Commission has added Saudi Arabia to an EU draft list of countries that pose a threat to the bloc because of lax controls against terrorism financing and money laundering, two sources told Reuters on Friday. The move comes amid heightened international pressure on Saudi Arabia after the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate on Oct. 2. The EU’s list currently consists of 16 countries, including Iran, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen and North Korea, and is mostly based on criteria used by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global body composed by wealthy nations meant to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. But the list has been updated this week, using new criteria developed by the EU Commission since 2017. Saudi Arabia is one of the countries added to the updated list which is still confidential, one EU source and one Saudi source told Reuters. Saudi authorities did not immediately respond to request for comment. The move is a setback for Riyadh at a time when it is striving to bolster its international reputation in order to encourage foreign investors to participate in a huge transformation plan and improve financial ties for its banks. Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post and a critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed and dismembered by Saudi agents at its Istanbul consulate on Oct 2, provoking widespread revulsion and damaging the kingdom’s image. Apart from reputational damages, the inclusion in the list complicates financial relations with the EU. The bloc’s banks will have to carry out additional checks on payments involving entities from listed jurisdictions. The provisional decision needs to be endorsed by the 28 EU states before being formally adopted next week. A second EU official said other countries are likely to be added to the final list but declined to elaborate as the information is still confidential and subject to changes. An EU commission spokesman said he had no comment on the content of the list as it had not been finalised yet. Countries are blacklisted if they “have strategic deficiencies in their anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism regimes that pose significant threats to the financial system of the Union,” the existing EU list says. Under the new EU methodology, jurisdictions could also be blacklisted if they do not provide sufficient information on ownership of companies or if their rules on reporting suspicious transactions or monitoring financial customers are considered too lax. Saudi Arabia missed out on gaining full FATF membership in September after it was determined to fall short in combating money laundering and terror financing. The government has taken steps to beef up its efforts to tackle graft and abuse of power, but FATF said in September that Riyadh was not effectively investigating and prosecuting individuals involved in larger scale money laundering activity or confiscating the proceeds of crime at home or abroad. The EU has reviewed 47 jurisdictions, including the United States, Russia and Switzerland, before updating its list. EU countries were not screened.

2019-01-25,"* China resells cargo, offers vessels out * Offers lowered in Asia on low demand * Europe, India, Mexico keep buying By Ekaterina Kravtsova LONDON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) fell for the fifth week in a row with no signs of demand picking up as temperatures remained above average in Asia-Pacific, allowing Europe to absorbing supplies. Spot prices for March delivery to Asia LNG-AS this week dropped to around $8.00 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), down 20 cents from the previous week, trade sources said. Lacklustre Chinese demand was illustrated by China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) reselling a spare cargo on board the Neo Energy tanker that had loaded in November and had been kept offshore in case of a surge in consumption. CNOOC is offering out the Neo Energy, as well as the Hoegh Esperanza, which it used as a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) this winter, shipbrokers said. This is another sign of China’s weak demand. Some market players continue to reschedule deliveries to Asian buyers, with one source saying a cargo was pushed back to November from March. Supply offers are ample. Trading house Trafigura and energy major Shell offered March cargoes in Asia at $8.00-8.20/MMbtu in the Platts window, but had to lower offers to $7.75-7.85/MMbtu due to a lack of interest. No transactions took place by the time of publication. Outages at Australia’s Gorgon plant and Indonesia’s Bontang did not help prices to firm. At Bontang, where a train is offline until next week, Pertamina indicated it may require a vessel to load a cargo in mid-February, signalling production is stable, shipbrokers said. Indonesia’s Donggi Senoro LNG is selling two March cargoes in a tender closing Jan. 30, according to the Platts window. In the Atlantic basin, Angola LNG offered a February cargo in a tender, while India’s Gail offered six cargoes for 2020 from its offtake from U.S. Sabine Pass and Cove Point in two tenders that closed this week. Falling Asian prices coupled with robust European gas hub prices, used as benchmarks for LNG trades, have led to an influx of cargoes to Europe, now the largest buyer of U.S. LNG. But even here, LNG prices are falling, with two traders saying spot cargoes are now heard at discounts to British and Dutch natural gas prices , against which they are normally at premium. “Europe is at discount over indexes ... Even Spain is coming flat to TTF (the Dutch gas hub price),” one European-based trade source said. A U.S. cargo was sold to Spain for delivery in late February below the Dutch gas benchmark, another trader said. Another U.S. cargo is on offer for March delivery to Europe. Demand also came from Mexico’s CFE which required two cargoes for February delivery. Charter rates for vessels with modern propulsion dropped to $60,000s per day this week, a half of where the rates were in late December, and are expected to keep falling as more vessels becoming available, shipbrokers said.

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open slightly higher, with Britain’s FTSE adding 0.2 percent, Germany’s DAX gaining 0.6 percent and France’s CAC advancing 0.45 percent. The euro hovered near a six-week low versus the dollar following dovish-sounding comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, who expressed concerns about the euro zone economy. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained more than 1 percent to scale its highest since Dec. 4. The index was headed for a gain of 0.8 percent this week, with shifting sentiment around Sino-U.S. trade talks partly helping to offset growing concerns over slowing global economic growth. The Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.9 percent after regulators announced new measures to strengthen Chinese banks’ capital. Tech-heavy South Korean shares added 1.4 percent. Australian stocks climbed 0.7 percent, lifted by higher prices of commodities such as iron ore and crude oil. Japan’s Nikkei advanced 1 percent with technology companies boosted by a surge in their U.S. peers. “Investors who were already excited about the U.S. chip sector’s earnings the day before got even more reassured after they saw how their stocks moved,” said Shogo Maekawa, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. Maekawa added that a recovery in the global cyclical chip sector is taken as a silver-lining amid concerns about a cooling world economic momentum. According to the latest Reuters polls of hundreds of economists from around the world, a synchronised global economic slowdown is under way and any escalation in the U.S.-China trade war would trigger a sharper downturn. “Equities may be drawing some support but the markets are bracing for next week’s events,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. “The U.S.-China trade discussions will provide insight into how talks are progressing, while the British parliamentary voting is a key Brexit event. And there is also the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting.” Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on Jan. 30 and 31 for the next round of trade negotiations with Washington. The two sides are “miles and miles” from resolving trade issues but there is a fair chance they will get a deal, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday. The British parliament will debate and vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit “plan B” on Jan. 29, and the U.S. Federal Reserve concludes a two-day policy setting meeting on Jan. 30. The Nasdaq had risen roughly 0.7 percent on Thursday thanks to a rally by chipmakers, while the S&P 500 edged higher and the Dow closed nominally lower as anxiety about slowing global growth and the Sino-U.S. trade dispute undercut a spate of strong earnings. In currency markets, the euro crawled up 0.1 percent to $1.1321 after dropping 0.7 percent overnight. It was still in close reach of a six-week trough of $1.1289 plumbed overnight. The euro was down 0.4 percent this week. The single currency slid after ECB President Draghi acknowledged on Thursday that economic growth in the euro zone was likely to be weaker than earlier expected due to the fall-out from factors ranging from China’s slowdown to Brexit. Germany has cut its economic growth forecast for 2019 to 1.0 percent from 1.8 percent due to slower global economic growth and uncertainty about Britain’s exit from the European Union, the Handelsblatt newspaper reported on Thursday. The ECB had left its policy stance unchanged as expected on Thursday and Draghi’s downbeat comments added to speculation that the central bank will hold back on interest rate hikes that some market watchers had expected in October. The pound was up 0.5 percent at $1.3127 after brushing a two-month high of $1.3140, lifted after The Sun reported on Thursday that Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party has privately decided to back May’s Brexit deal next week if it includes a clear time limit to the Irish backstop. The dollar nudged up 0.15 percent to 109.78 yen and on track to end the week little changed. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield was slightly higher at 2.729 percent after dropping to a one-week low as pessimism over global growth supported safe-haven government debt. Crude oil extended gains after rallying the previous day as the United States threatened sanctions on Venezuela’s crude exports as the country descended further into political and economic turmoil. U.S. crude oil futures were up 1.3 percent at $53.83 per barrel after gaining 1 percent on Thursday.

2019-01-25,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Electric Co is advising some buyers of its big power turbines to switch out faulty blades sooner than expected and has disclosed that a blade broke in 2015, according to a presentation reviewed by Reuters and people briefed on the matter. The second blade break, which has not been previously reported, involved an earlier turbine model and was similar to a break last September that severely damaged a turbine in Texas and shut it down for two months of repairs.  The defective blade issue affects GE’s newest turbine technology, which cost billions of dollars to develop, and is among the challenges facing new Chief Executive Larry Culp as he tries to revive the profits and share price of the 127-year-old conglomerate. GE’s advice for fixing the problem can curb turbine use by utilities, according to the sources and utilities that use GE turbines, potentially threatening the revenue streams at the power plants. At private meetings in Florida and London last month, GE executives said the company is offering extended warranty coverage and making spare parts available to ease concerns of insurers, lenders and utilities interested in buying turbines, according to a GE executive’s slideshow presentation and three people who attended the meetings. Some said they signed non-disclosure agreements. GE told participants that turbines with at-risk blades should run for fewer than about 7,000 hours depending on individual plant circumstances, before shutting down for blade replacement, according to two people who attended the meetings. GE said it had advised customers of the change. GE’s previous guidance for blades was after 25,000 hours. The executives also said in the meetings that the blade that broke in 2015 at an undisclosed power plant was in a GE 9FB turbine, which has similar technology to the HA turbine that broke in Texas. The 2015 break prompted GE to work on new protective coatings and alter a heat treatment process for the parts, a second presentation showed. (GE turbine outage data: tmsnrt.rs/2Rs5mU3)         GE told Reuters that after the blade broke in 2015, GE did not know at first that the problem would also afflict its HA models. “The HA components were in development before the initial 9FB issue occurred, and the HA units began to ship while the root-cause analysis was in process and before it was determined that it was a component issue that impacted the 9FB fleet and the HA,” GE said in a statement to Reuters. GE declined to provide more detail about the 2015 blade break or usage restrictions, saying some of the information is proprietary. “We are executing the plan we laid out to fix the (blade) issue,” GE said in a statement to Reuters. “The feedback from customers has been positive, and they continue to choose the HA, which remains the fastest-growing fleet of advanced technology turbines in the world today.” The details from GE’s meetings come as GE is installing new blades in about 50 9FB and 52 HA turbines, according to a person familiar with the matter, fewer than the 130 estimated after the blade break in Texas prompted it to warn that other turbines are at risk for blade failure. Reuters previously reported that GE found an oxidation problem, not a break, in 2015 and developed a fix before the failure in Texas. Scaling back use of GE turbines reduces how much electricity they produce, a threat to revenues and profits for Exelon Corp, PSEG Power LLC, Chubu Electric Power Co Inc and others with the 400-ton GE machines that form the core of modern gas-fired power plants, according to utilities and industry experts. Japan’s Chubu Electric said it learned about the blade problem with its six new GE turbines last October. It is restricting operation time at one of the two plants that use GE’s HA turbines, but expects to have “enough reserve capacity to generate sufficient electricity to meet demand during this winter,” a spokesman told Reuters. He said Chubu will tally the financial impact “depending on how long the plants would be shut down” to replace blades. It expects repairs to be completed by the end of February. PSEG Power and Exelon, based in the United States, declined to comment on how restrictions would affect them. GE is continuing to sell turbines in a slumping market for big power plants, where it has lost share to rivals Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems and Siemens AG. GE has said it booked orders for three large turbines last month. GE’s share price fell after GE revealed a blade issue in Texas on September 19, saying such “teething problems” are not uncommon with new technology and would require “minor adjustments” to fix. GE has said it would set aside $480 million for repairs and warranty claims. Three days after the break in Texas became known, Electricite de France SA shut down its HA turbine to replace blades. EDF did not respond to requests for comment. At the London meeting, about 100 insurance industry people gathered in the oak-paneled Old Library room of Lloyd’s of London on December 13, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information. GE power executives Marcus Scholz and Tom Dreisbach gave presentations about GE’s turbine technology. In its turbine documentation, GE has advised its power customers to inspect turbines with so-called “Generation 1” blades after 25,000 hours of use. GE said its improved blades, known as “Generation 2,” are designed to last 25,000 hours or more before being replaced. According to page 11 of his presentation, Dreisbach said the Generation 1 blade that broke in 2015 failed after 22,000 hours. New parts treated with a special coating were inspected by technicians after about 12,000 and 16,000 hours and “cracking (was) still observed,” the presentation said. GE inspected other turbines at about 7,000 hours and “early stages of cracking (were) observed,” the presentation said.

2019-01-25,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Blistering heat triggered power outages on Australia’s strained grid on Friday as demand for air-conditioning soared and coal-fired generators struggled to meet the surge in consumption. To shore up the grid, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) cut power to Alcoa Corp’s Portland aluminum smelter, the biggest consumer in the state of Victoria, for nearly two hours on Thursday evening and on Friday. The record-breaking heatwave over the past week sent power prices soaring across southeastern Australia.  Wholesale power prices in Victoria hit the market cap of A$14,500 ($10,298) per megawatt hour (MWh) before midday on Friday, earlier than expected, then dropped to A$300, National Electricity Market data showed. (bit.ly/2W9A7A2) Supply was tight, with a total of 1,800 megawatts (MW) of generation offline in the country’s east, AEMO Chief Executive Audrey Zibelman said on Australian Broadcasting Corp TV. AGL Energy’s Loy Yang power plant and EnergyAustralia’s Yallourn, both in Victoria, were among those with units down.  Transmission links from the states of Tasmania, New South Wales and South Australia were transferring power to Victoria at full capacity, Zibelman said. “With all of that, however, we found ourselves short...for up to the next two hours,” she said. “We may have to do more over the course of the afternoon, as the demand continues to increase.” The AEMO has ordered cuts of 200 MW, which would affect about 60,000 Victorian customers. Temperatures in the South Australian capital of Adelaide rose to just shy of 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) on Thursday, a record high. Melbourne, the capital of Victoria, was set to hit 44C on Friday, before a drop of about 15 degrees expected mid-afternoon. Victoria Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio said it was clear Australia’s summers were getting longer, hotter and more extreme because of climate change. “We can see that the problem we’ve got now is that we’ve got a 20th century system for a 21st century climate,” she told reporters at a televised briefing. Australia is a signatory to the Paris climate accord reached in 2015, under which it has committed to cutting carbon emissions by between 26 percent to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. As insurance ahead of this summer, the AEMO lined up 930 MW of reserve power, including an agreement to pay Alcoa’s Portland smelter to curb power when supplies are tight. Last summer, the reserve program cost the market operator A$52 million. However, the power cut to Alcoa on Thursday came without notice because of unexpectedly high temperatures, causing demand to spike, the AEMO said. “Alcoa will not be compensated for the curtailment,” Alcoa spokeswoman Jodie Read said. But Friday’s cut to Alcoa will be under the reserve agreement. In South Australia, where power capacity has been beefed up with diesel generators and gas-fired plants over the past two years following a state-wide blackout, 30,000 homes lost power on Thursday after transformers on local power lines overheated and switched off. “After days of heat, we were in some uncharted territory yesterday with record heat and record load sustained well into the night,” said Paul Roberts, a spokesman for SA Power Networks, the South Australian local distribution network operator.

2019-01-25,"WASHINGTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - The United States is seeking to ensure that Venezuelan oil revenue goes to opposition leader and self-declared interim president Juan Guaido, and to cut off money from isolated President Nicolas Maduro, a top U.S. official said on Thursday. Although short on details, the announcement signals that Washington is willing to go beyond traditional diplomatic measures and will seek to drain cash from Maduro’s government, which is already struggling under an unprecedented economic meltdown. Such a move would significantly strengthen the hand of Guaido, who swore himself in as interim head of state on Wednesday with the support of Washington and nations around the region. “What we’re focusing on today is disconnecting the illegitimate Maduro regime from the sources of his revenues,”  national security advisor John Bolton told reporters at the White House.  “We think consistent with our recognition of Juan Guaido as the constitutional interim president of Venezuela that those revenues should go to the legitimate government.” Bolton added that the process was “very complicated” and that officials were still studying how this would function. Venezuela’s information ministry did not reply to a request for comment. Guaido, in an interview with broadcaster Univision, said he believed this was “the beginning of the end” for Maduro and he would work to guarantee humanitarian aid and implement new economic measures to rachet up pressure. “Our challenge is to secure free elections, and we want them as soon as possible. But we are living in a dictatorship,” he said, from an undisclosed location. Washington’s support for Guaido prompted Maduro, Venezuela’s leader since 2013, to break relations with the United States. On Thursday, he said he was closing Venezuela’s embassy in Washington and its consulates in the United States. Guaido’s swearing-in was the opposition’s boldest challenge yet to the long-ruling Socialist Party and has given Maduro’s adversaries an unprecedented diplomatic platform to press for change in a nation dogged by hyperinflation, rising malnutrition and political conflict.                     But Guaido now leads what amounts to a shadow government disavowed by the armed forces and with no influence over day-to-day administration such as importing and distributing food and medicine. The 35-year-old industrial engineer said he had spoken on Thursday by telephone with supportive heads of state from around the world.  In the Univision interview, Guaido repeated his proposal of future amnesties to officials and military members who disavowed Maduro, even saying the offer could be extended to government ministers and to Maduro himself if they willingly left power. Guaido’s ascent was greeted with excitement by investors holding Venezuela and state oil company PDVSA bonds, which hit their highest level since 2017 despite being almost entirely in default. Concerns about potential disruption of Venezuelan crude supplies gave support to global oil prices. Oil revenues are crucial to the already crumbling Venezuelan economy and routing that money away from Maduro as the United State seeks to do would be a serious blow. The U.S. State Department on Thursday ordered some U.S. government workers to leave Venezuela and said U.S. citizens should consider leaving the country.  Guaido took the helm of the National Assembly on Jan. 5 with a call for the armed forces to recognise Maduro as a “usurper” after his May 2018 re-election, widely viewed as fraudulent.     Backing for him has come principally from the Western hemisphere. Venezuelan allies including Russia and Turkey - both important commercial partners - criticized Guaido’s rise as a sign of U.S. interference. The European Union, which has imposed sanctions on Maduro’s government, noted that Venezuelans had “massively called for democracy and the possibility to freely determine their own destiny,” but stopped short of recognising Guaido. Maduro, in a rambling speech, dismissed Guaido’s inauguration and said he himself remained the country’s legitimate leader.  He has relied extensively on the military to maintain power amid annual inflation of nearly 2 million percent and an exodus of Venezuelan refugees into neighbouring countries. Guaido has said Maduro’s Jan. 10 inauguration to a second six-year term amounted to a usurpation of power. The vote was boycotted by Venezuela’s main opposition parties, with Maduro’s two most popular rivals banned from running and Socialist Party aggressive campaigning opponents called vote-buying. Guaido and allies argue that the presidency is vacant as a result and that the constitution calls for the head of congress to assume the interim presidency in such a situation. That still leaves Guaido struggling against a state unwilling to recognise him and security forces that could jail him, as they did his mentor Leopoldo Lopez - who is under house arrest for leading anti-Maduro protests in 2014. “Can he name ministers? Ministers of air? Phantom ministers?,” asked Maduro during a speech before the Supreme Court. “Is he going to name commanders of military units? Will the armed forces obey his command? Never.”  Protesters clashed with security forces on Wednesday night around the country and in both affluent and working class areas of Caracas, with some demonstrations spilling over into looting. A total of 14 people have been killed in violence linked to this week’s protests, according to local rights groups.

Imports from Russia reached 7.04 million tonnes, or 1.658 million barrels per day, in December, up 40 percent from 5.03 million tonnes a year earlier, according to the data from the General Administration of Customs. For the full year, Russian imports rose to 71.49 million tonnes, or 1.43 million bpd, up 19.7 percent from 59.7 million tonnes in 2017. Demand for Russian crude was supported by a rise in throughput by China’s private refiners, who favour Russian grades such as ESPO, while geopolitical uncertainties also forced China to import less from countries such as Iran and Venezuela. Russian oil giant Rosneft has also marketed its ESPO grade more aggressively, signing new long term supply deals with state oil companies such as ChemChina and PetroChina. Saudi Arabia supplied China with 6.97 million tonnes in December, or 1.64 million bpd, up 48 percent from 4.71 million tonnes a year earlier. For 2018, OPEC’s top supplier boosted shipments to China by 8.7 percent to 56.73 million tonnes, or 1.135 million bpd. That means Russia’s lead over Saudi Arabia in supplying China almost doubled to 295,000 bpd in 2018 from 150,000 bpd a year earlier. U.S. shipments to China - which have been hit by a trade war between the two nations - came in at zero in December. Imports for 2018 were up 24.8 percent from 2017 at 245,616 bpd. Chinese oil trader Unipec plans to resume U.S. crude shipments to China by March, Reuters reported in December. Venezuelan supplies to China tumbled 24 percent in 2018 to 16.63 million tonnes, or 332,600 bpd, after the OPEC member’s production fell to a seven-decade low amid a lack of investment, mismanagement and fleeing workers. Iranian imports were at 2.14 million tonnes in December, or 503,896 bpd, down 12 percent from a year earlier. Full year Iranian imports dropped to 29.274 million tonnes, or 585,475 bpd, down 20 percent from 2017 after the United States imposed sanction on Tehran over its disputed nuclear programme. China is among the countries that were granted a waiver from sanctions on Iranian oil imports, allowed to buy 360,000 bpd of oil for 180 days until May.

International Brent crude oil futures were at $61.01 a barrel at 0124 GMT, down 8 cents their last settlement. Brent futures closed down 0.1 percent in the previous session. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $53.08 per barrel, down 6 cents from their last settlement. WTI futures closed up 1 percent on Thursday. “Price action was tempered by an unexpected rise in inventories,” ANZ Bank said in a research note.

Crude inventories rose by 8 million barrels in the week to Jan. 18, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decline of 42,000 barrels.

The euro struggled near a six-week low versus the dollar following dovish-sounding comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, who expressed concerns about the euro zone economy. A synchronised global economic slowdown is under way and any escalation in the U.S.-China trade war would trigger a sharper downturn, according to the latest Reuters polls of hundreds of economists from around the world. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.2 percent. The index was headed for a loss of 0.1 percent this week. Australian stocks climbed 0.5 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI added 0.7 percent. Japan’s Nikkei advanced 1 percent. “Equities may be drawing some support but the markets are bracing for next week’s events,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. “The U.S.-China trade discussions will provide insight into how talks are progressing, while the British parliamentary voting is a key Brexit event. And there is also the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting.” Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on Jan. 30 and 31 for the next round of trade negotiations with Washington. The two sides are “miles and miles” from resolving trade issues but there is a fair chance they will get a deal, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday. The British parliament will debate and vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit “plan B” on Jan. 29, and the U.S. Federal Reserve concludes a two-day policy setting meeting on Jan. 30. The Nasdaq had risen roughly 0.7 percent on Thursday thanks to a rally by chipmakers, while the S&P 500 edged higher and the Dow closed nominally lower as anxiety about slowing global growth and the Sino-U.S. trade dispute undercut a spate of strong earnings. In currency markets, the euro held steady at $1.1311 after losing about 0.7 percent overnight, when it brushed the six-week trough of $1.1289. The euro was down 0.5 percent this week. The single currency slid after ECB President Draghi acknowledged on Thursday that economic growth in the euro zone was likely to be weaker than earlier expected due to the fall-out from factors ranging from China’s slowdown to Brexit. Germany, France and Italy, the euro zone’s biggest economies, barely grew in the fourth quarter of 2018 and survey data showed on Thursday business activity across the euro zone expanded at the slowest pace since 2013 at the start of this year. Germany has dropped its economic growth forecast for 2019 to 1.0 percent from 1.8 percent due to slower global economic growth and uncertainty about Britain’s exit from the European Union, the Handelsblatt newspaper reported on Thursday. The ECB had left its policy stance unchanged as expected on Thursday and Draghi’s downbeat comments added to speculation that the central bank will hold back on interest rate hikes that some market watchers had expected in October. The pound was up 0.3 percent at $1.3096 after brushing a two-month high of $1.3130, drawing support after The Sun reported on Thursday that Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party has privately decided to back Prime Minister May’s Brexit deal next week if it includes a clear time limit to the Irish backstop. The dollar nudged up 0.05 percent to 109.67 yen and on track to end the week little changed. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield was slightly higher at 2.724 percent after dropping 4 basis points overnight to a one-week low as concerns over slowing global growth supported safe-haven government debt. U.S. crude oil futures were flat at $53.13 per barrel after gaining 1 percent the previous day on U.S. threat of sanctions on Venezuela.

2019-01-25,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s public spending watchdog on Friday questioned a government estimate of 24 billion pounds as the cost of tax relief to decommission oil and gas infrastructure. As one of the oldest and most mature oil basins, Britain’s North Sea represents the world’s biggest decommissioning project, with the Oil and Gas Authority estimating operators will need to spend around 60 billion pounds. The government has given oil and gas operators different kinds of tax relief designed to revive investment in the British North Sea, where oil production has plummeted from 2.6 million barrels per day in 1999 to around 1 million. Tax relief for decommissioning is designed to lower the threshold for potential buyers of oil fields who might otherwise balk at the option of investing in limited future production and eventually be saddled with a huge decommissioning bill. “The government estimates that decommissioning the UK’s offshore oil and gas infrastructure will cost taxpayers 24 billion pounds, although the actual cost is highly uncertain,” the National Audit Office said, referring the years until 2063. The final cost depends on factors such as the oil price, foreign exchange rates and technological progress. “The NAO found that there are gaps in the government’s understanding of the costs and benefits of changes to the tax regime. HM Revenue and Customs has not historically calculated the total combined cost of decommissioning tax reliefs it has already given to operators,” the NAO added. The watchdog, which can give recommendations to government to change its spending, did not do so in this case and when asked whether the statement was meant as a call to change the rules, an NAO spokesman said it was not. The government said in an emailed statement in response to the NAO’s report that it was working with the oil industry to minimise decommissioning costs. “By providing tax relief on decommissioning we are attracting continued investment into our reserves - supporting jobs, boosting the economy and protecting our energy supply,” a government spokesman said.

2019-01-25,"SAINT-MARTIN-DE-LA-PORTE, France (Reuters) - Italy’s 5-Star Movement and League party were rivals going into last year’s national election, became coalition partners in a populist government afterwards, and now an Alpine rail tunnel threatens to tear them apart. The dispute over whether to forge ahead with one of Europe’s most ambitious engineering projects is rooted in the divergent nature of the two anti-establishment parties and highlights their conflicting visions for Italy’s future. The hard-right, pro-business League wants the tunnel to go ahead, as do two-thirds of Italians, according to an EMG Acqua poll last week. On the other hand, more than half of 5-Star’s left-leaning and environmentally friendly supporters oppose it. “It’s striking because they are two populist forces with two very different groups of people supporting them,” said Lorenzo Pregliasco, a founder of YouTrend, a political consultancy based in Turin, the northwestern city where trains are supposed to arrive from France after passing through the tunnel. A 2,400-tonne boring machine nicknamed “Federica” is already working around the clock more than 1,000 metres (3,000 feet) below ground on the French side of the border even though Rome is threatening to pull the plug as it reviews the project. The tunnel is stoking tension within the coalition because of regional and European elections in May, which could reverse the balance of power within the eight-month-old coalition and destabilise a government that manages one of the world’s largest debts, which is closely monitored by financial markets. Polls foresee the League surging above 5-Star, which has already compromised on other major battles in recent months but appears not to want to give ground on the 8.6-billion-euro (7.5 billion pounds) tunnel. Transport Minister and 5-Star member Danilo Toninelli told Reuters a decision would come before the elections, and 5-Star bigwig Alessandro Di Battista said the project was “idiocy”. In December, Italy agreed with France to freeze new contracts on the 36-mile (58 km) tunnel until completion of an Italian cost-benefit analysis by a panel of experts, which Toninelli has said should be published by the end of the month. “If the analysis says that we’re throwing away money, only a madman would move forward,” 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio said on Monday. However, it might not prove so easy to kill the project. Deep in the bowels of the Mount Cenis (Moncenisio), geothermal energy heats the air to about 29 degrees (84 Fahrenheit). With a force equal to the power of eight Formula 1 engines, boring machine Federica rumbles and shakes as she cuts into coal-coloured rock, advancing as much as 18 metres per day. So far the joint French and Italian company - the Tunnel Euralpin Lyon Turin (TELT) - has dug more than 15 miles (25 km) inside the mountain, including four access tunnels and about 4 miles (6 km) of one of the two main passageways. Some 800 people are employed, either directly or indirectly, TELT says, and that number will balloon to 8,000 if and when work reaches full capacity. Those in favour of the project, known in Italy as the TAV, say the costs of shutting it down with 25 km (15 miles) already dug could equal those of finishing it. “You can’t turn off the boring machine, leave it there and walk away,” said Piergiuseppe Gilli, TELT’s chief of construction, who has worked on the project for 22 years. The European Union is picking up 40 percent of the cost, which could increase to 50 percent, because it is part of a “Mediterranean Corridor” meant to link rail yards and ports from Spain to the Ukrainian border with Hungary. French Transport Minister Elizabeth Borne has emphasised the “geostrategic” importance of the project, saying it must not lose EU funding. Deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini, who is also leader of the League, expressed his categorical support for it on Friday: “The TAV absolutely must be done. It would cost more not to do it than to do it.” Supporters of the Franco-Italian rail link have staged two large rallies in recent months in Turin, which is about 40 miles (65 km) from the French border. Local League politicians attended the demonstrations.      “It would improve Italy’s links to other European countries and permit faster movement of passengers and goods,” Turin resident Salvatore Bellomo said in the city’s central square. “This project would bring Italy into the future.” In the past the “No-TAV Movement”, which is also supported by far-left activists, has frequently clashed with police, and after death threats, two of TELT’s top managers are under 24-hour armed guard. The argument 5-Star makes against the project is that it is a huge waste of public money and a potential health concern for people who live near the Italian work site, where some of the rock dust could release asbestos into the air. The money would be better spent on Italy’s existing infrastructure, which is crumbling, 5-Star says, citing the collapse of a motorway bridge in August that killed 43 people. “The flow of goods is not expected to be large enough to justify public works of these dimensions,” said Angelo Tartaglia, a retired professor at Turin’s Polytechic University. “It would not be profitable, and what’s worse is ... the maintenance costs would be higher than the tunnel’s revenue.” Tartaglia is on a committee of experts formed by the Turin mayor Chiara Appendino after she became one of the first 5-Star heads of a major Italian city in 2016. The 5-Star fight against the tunnel dates back to a time when it was still trying to make its name known, and the party’s founder, comic Beppe Grillo, was calling for an environmentally friendly economic model based on “happy negative growth”. But being in government has forced 5-Star to shed some of its anti-establishment identity. The movement has already relented on promises to close the Ilva steel plant or shut down construction of a gas pipeline from Albania. “These kind of reality checks are part of the nature of this government,” consultant Pregliasco said, referring to Ilva and the pipeline. “The difference with the tunnel is its higher symbolic value for 5-Star.” Additional reporting by Gavin Jones in Rome, and Simon Carraud in Paris; Editing by Giles Elgood",https://uk.reuters.com/article/italy-politics-tunnel/analysis-tunnel-exposes-deep-conflict-in-italys-populist-government-idUKL8N1ZL2HF,25 Jan 2019,"Italy's

2019-01-25,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on Friday, as strong earnings helped to underpin investor sentiment in the face of growing signs that the global economy is slowing and a still unresolved trade dispute between the United States and China. The euro rebounded against the dollar after falling to its lowest in six weeks following Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting. European markets opened firmer, with the automakers and tech sector indices rising 1.5 percent and 1 percent respectively. The pan-European STOXX index hit its highest since Dec. 4, last up 0.7 percent on the day. [.EU] The gains came as stocks rose overnight in Asia and the United States on the back of strong earnings from U.S. tech firms.  MSCI’s All-Country World Index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.3 percent on the day. But the gauge was set to break a four-week streak of gains as weak economic data and cautious soundings from central banks pulled the index half a percent down on the week. Data at the start of the week showed China’s economy grew at its slowest in 28 years in 2018, while purchasing manager indexes in Germany and the euro zone indicated stagnation in the bloc. On Thursday, the European Central Bank alluded to downside risks to growth for the first time in its statement since April 2017, while Germany cut its economic growth forecast for 2019. Somber news continued to trickle in on Friday, with German business morale falling for the fifth month in a row in January according to the Ifo business climate index.

According to the latest Reuters polls of hundreds of economists from around the world, a synchronized global economic slowdown is underway and any escalation in the U.S.-China trade war would trigger a sharper downturn. Sunil Krishnan, head of multi-asset funds at Aviva Investors said investors were taking some relief from the responses of policymakers. “What they (investors) were not seeing last year was that activity was slowing but there was no reaction from central banks. They are seeing that now - we saw that from the ECB and the Fed has said it’s not on a pre-set path.”  That along with a rebound from poor liquidity in December explains why the risk tone in markets has been a bit better, he said. In a note to clients, UBS Global Wealth Management’s chief investment officer Mark Haefele said that rhetoric on U.S.-China trade has become more positive, and that Beijing has taken steps to stimulate its economy. “While economic and earnings growth is slowing, we believe it is unlikely that growth will drop far below trend,” he said. “At the same time, there are reasons to be cautious about policymakers’ ability to follow through on their rhetoric.” Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on Jan. 30 and 31 for the next round of trade negotiations with Washington.

2019-01-25,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German consumers must not be burdened with higher electricity network fees when the country abandons stable coal-fired power for environmental reasons, the chief regulator of power transport grids said. A government-appointed coal commission is tasked with drawing up a schedule for the exit from coal on Friday, or Feb. 1 latest, building in compensation for operators, employees and affected regions in a long-term process. “I consider it important to do everything possible to prevent rising prices for consumers because of the coal exit,” Jochen Homann, president of the Bundesnetzagentur or Federal Network Agency, said. “It is my job to ensure that no unnecessary costs are added to grid fees,” he said on the sidelines of an industry conference this week. The Bundesnetzagentur supervises grid operators to ensure that networks are kept in balance. It also monitors costs which operators charge to consumers. Homann’s concern about spillover costs is not far-fetched given the government is keen to keep all sides happy in the coal compromise, looking to spread costs and limiting burdens on the general budget. Network companies charge consumers 24.4 percent of their final bill for network investment and management. These costs are already rising because green energy is difficult to integrate due to its intermittent nature, causing high “re-dispatch” spending on handling shortfalls and drawing on reserve plants.  In 2017, this bill came to 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) and stood at 900 million in the first three quarters of 2018. Generation costs could also rise after Germany quits coal, Homann said. “It is a simple economic fact: If coal plants are taken out of the system, supply gets tighter, and then you would have to think about prices going up and how to handle that,” he said. Regarding the technical challenges, Homann said his agency had factored in the possibility that half of Germany’s existing coal plant capacity of 43 gigawatts (GW) might close by 2030.  Of some 5,900 km (3,700 miles) of additional grids and power line improvements planned to accommodate the increase in renewable installations in the next decade, only 600 km have been approved and just 150 km implemented. The picture for plans up to 2020 is more favorable. Power network operators have completed 800 km out of a necessary 1,800 km, and 400 km have been approved.

2019-01-25,"LONDON (Reuters) - Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said soldiers might have to return to the border with Northern Ireland if Brexit went wrong, Bloomberg reported. In a worst-case scenario, a hard border could “involve people in uniform and it may involve the need, for example, for cameras, physical infrastructure, possibly a police presence, or an army presence to back it up,” Varadkar told Bloomberg. “The problem with that in the context of Irish politics and history is those things become targets,” he said. Ireland has said it would find it difficult to avoid imposing a hard border on Northern Ireland if the United Kingdom crashes out of the EU without a deal.

2019-01-25,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Sinopec Corp said its trading unit Unipec lost 4.65 billion yuan (525.64 million pounds) on crude oil hedging in the fourth quarter, one of China’s largest derivatives trading losses in nearly a decade. Asia’s top refiner, which said the loss had pulled down its fourth quarter profits, suspended Unipec President Chen Bo last month, citing unspecified trading losses. State-owned Sinopec still managed to report its best annual results since 2013 on Friday. “Investigations have shown Unipec has applied some inappropriate trading strategies in hedging crude oil business,” the company said in a filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange after the markets closed on Friday.  “Because of wrong calls on the oil price moves, (the company) incurred losses on the futures side of the hedging when oil prices fell,” Sinopec said in the statement, without specifying what futures products it traded.  Chen is an industry veteran who helped the company become one of the world’s largest oil traders. A senior Communist Party representative of the company was also suspended. John Driscoll, managing director of consultancy JTD Energy said as the world’s largest crude importer, China is naturally  exposed to any upside shifts in the market.  “Being net short crude, they are a natural buyer of futures, swaps or call options. When the market tanks, unfortunately, long-side forward hedges are hit with losses,” Driscoll said.   Benchmark Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices were down by more than 30 percent at end-2018 after hitting their highest in four years in October. Prices were hit by oversupply concerns as major producers ramped up output while the United States unexpectedly issued waivers that allowed countries to continue importing Iranian oil despite sanctions. Sinopec said in the filing that Unipec had also saved 6.4 billion yuan for its refineries in physical crude oil purchases when measured against the global oil benchmarks.  “Immediately after noticing abnormalities in the financial indicators. ..Sinopec terminated the transactions and carried out several measures to prevent further losses.” the company said, adding it has stepped up internal compliances.  Sinopec reported 62.39 billion yuan ($9.2 billion) in net profit for 2018, up 22 percent from the previous year, data from the filling showed.  Total revenue also rose 22 percent in 2018 to reach 2.88 trillion yuan for the full year, Sinopec said.  Fourth quarter net income, however, was only 2.41 billion yuan, Reuters calculations based on the filing showed, down 86 percent from the fourth quarter of 2017 and Sinopec’s worst quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2015.  Revenue in the last quarter of 2018 rose to 808.6 billion yuan from 615.2 billion yuan in the same period a year earlier.  Sinopec also said on Friday that its refinery throughput last year rose 2.3 percent over 2017 to 244 million tonnes, or 4.88 million barrels per day.  Its crude oil output fell 1.75 percent to 288.5 million barrels but natural gas rose 7.1 percent to 977 billion cubic feet. In 2009, three Chinese state-run airlines reported book losses totalling 13.17 billion yuan on aviation fuel hedging contracts.

2019-01-25,"(Repeats to additional customers with no changes to text) * GE offers to extend warranty coverage for turbines * GE says blade broke in 2015 on 9FB turbine after 22,000 hours * GE says executing its plan to fix the blade issue * GE says customer feedback is “positive” By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK, Jan 25 (Reuters) - General Electric Co is advising some buyers of its big power turbines to switch out faulty blades sooner than expected and has disclosed that a blade broke in 2015, according to a presentation reviewed by Reuters and people briefed on the matter. The second blade break, which has not been previously reported, involved an earlier turbine model and was similar to a break last September that severely damaged a turbine in Texas and shut it down for two months of repairs. The defective blade issue affects GE’s newest turbine technology, which cost billions of dollars to develop, and is among the challenges facing new Chief Executive Larry Culp as he tries to revive the profits and share price of the 127-year-old conglomerate. GE’s advice for fixing the problem can curb turbine use by utilities, according to the sources and utilities that use GE turbines, potentially threatening the revenue streams at the power plants. At private meetings in Florida and London last month, GE executives said the company is offering extended warranty coverage and making spare parts available to ease concerns of insurers, lenders and utilities interested in buying turbines, according to a GE executive’s slideshow presentation and three people who attended the meetings. Some said they signed non-disclosure agreements. GE told participants that turbines with at-risk blades should run for fewer than about 7,000 hours depending on individual plant circumstances, before shutting down for blade replacement, according to two people who attended the meetings. GE said it had advised customers of the change. GE’s previous guidance for blades was after 25,000 hours. The executives also said in the meetings that the blade that broke in 2015 at an undisclosed power plant was in a GE 9FB turbine, which has similar technology to the HA turbine that broke in Texas. The 2015 break prompted GE to work on new protective coatings and alter a heat treatment process for the parts, a second presentation showed. GE told Reuters that after the blade broke in 2015, GE did not know at first that the problem would also afflict its HA models. “The HA components were in development before the initial 9FB issue occurred, and the HA units began to ship while the root-cause analysis was in process and before it was determined that it was a component issue that impacted the 9FB fleet and the HA,” GE said in a statement to Reuters. GE declined to provide more detail about the 2015 blade break or usage restrictions, saying some of the information is proprietary. “We are executing the plan we laid out to fix the (blade) issue,” GE said in a statement to Reuters. “The feedback from customers has been positive, and they continue to choose the HA, which remains the fastest-growing fleet of advanced technology turbines in the world today.” The details from GE’s meetings come as GE is installing new blades in about 50 9FB and 52 HA turbines, according to a person familiar with the matter, fewer than the 130 estimated after the blade break in Texas prompted it to warn that other turbines are at risk for blade failure. Reuters previously reported that GE found an oxidation problem, not a break, in 2015 and developed a fix before the failure in Texas. Scaling back use of GE turbines reduces how much electricity they produce, a threat to revenues and profits for Exelon Corp , PSEG Power LLC, Chubu Electric Power Co Inc and others with the 400-ton GE machines that form the core of modern gas-fired power plants, according to utilities and industry experts. Japan’s Chubu Electric said it learned about the blade problem with its six new GE turbines last October. It is restricting operation time at one of the two plants that use GE’s HA turbines, but expects to have “enough reserve capacity to generate sufficient electricity to meet demand during this winter,” a spokesman told Reuters. He said Chubu will tally the financial impact “depending on how long the plants would be shut down” to replace blades. It expects repairs to be completed by the end of February. PSEG Power and Exelon, based in the United States, declined to comment on how restrictions would affect them. GE is continuing to sell turbines in a slumping market for big power plants, where it has lost share to rivals Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems and Siemens AG. GE has said it booked orders for three large turbines last month. GE’s share price fell after GE revealed a blade issue in Texas on September 19, saying such “teething problems” are not uncommon with new technology and would require “minor adjustments” to fix. GE has said it would set aside $480 million for repairs and warranty claims. Three days after the break in Texas became known, Electricite de France SA shut down its HA turbine to replace blades. EDF did not respond to requests for comment. At the London meeting, about 100 insurance industry people gathered in the oak-paneled Old Library room of Lloyd’s of London on December 13, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information. GE power executives Marcus Scholz and Tom Dreisbach gave presentations about GE’s turbine technology. In its turbine documentation, GE has advised its power customers to inspect turbines with so-called “Generation 1” blades after 25,000 hours of use. GE said its improved blades, known as “Generation 2,” are designed to last 25,000 hours or more before being replaced. According to page 11 of his presentation, Dreisbach said the Generation 1 blade that broke in 2015 failed after 22,000 hours. New parts treated with a special coating were inspected by technicians after about 12,000 and 16,000 hours and “cracking (was) still observed,” the presentation said. GE inspected other turbines at about 7,000 hours and “early stages of cracking (were) observed,” the presentation said. Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Additional reporting by Yuka

2019-01-25,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Dutch government is lagging far behind on its climate goals and will, need to take immediate action in order to meet legally required improvements, the Dutch Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL) warned on Friday. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in 2020 in the Netherlands, one of the most polluting countries in Europe, are expected to be 21 percent lower than in 1990, the agency said, despite a court order to reduce them by 25 percent.  The new calculations put the government in a tight spot, as it is already struggling to generate support for measures needed to reach its ultimate goal of halving CO2 emissions by 2030 and banning them altogether by 2050. The court order to step up the fight against climate change has increased the pressure on the government to immediately shut down at least two of five coal-fired energy plants. Current plans call for two to be shut in 2024 and the other three by 2030. Shutting two immediately would cost hundreds of millions of euros and deliver just half of the CO2 reduction required. Further savings would need to come from energy saving measures such as lowering speed limits, improving home insulation and raising energy prices, experts have said.  The government in October said it would implement the court order, but in recent days politicians have expressed doubts about the expensive, and often unpopular, measures that would be needed to do this at such short notice. A government spokesman could not immediately respond to the new calculations on Friday.

2019-01-25,"NEW YORK/SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - Refining profits for gasoline are crashing around the world as consumption stalls amid a huge wave of new supplies, resulting in record inventories in Asia, America and Europe. In the U.S. market, gasoline margins sank to $5.70 per barrel on Thursday, the lowest seasonally since 2009, weighed down by weak demand for the fuel and excess supply. The low margins, known in the industry as cracks, come as U.S. gasoline stockpiles rose to 259.6 million barrels last week, the highest level on record, according to figures released on Thursday by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The EIA began collecting such data in 1990. U.S. investment bank Jefferies said in a note on Friday that the “gasoline glut keeps getting worse”. Light distillate stocks, including gasoline and naphtha, in key hubs (the United States, Singapore, Japan and Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp) are at their highest since at least 2005, and up by 21 million barrels year-on-year, consultancy FGE said. Refiners in the United States have overproduced gasoline in recent months as they ran full-out to capture strong margins for other distillate fuels such as diesel, market participants said. “Overproduction of gasoline ensued and now you’re in a situation where in various parts of the world gasoline cracks are basically zero or negative,” said Zachary Rogers, an oil markets analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. The overproduction of gasoline is also down to the surge in American shale oil output, which has helped drive U.S. crude production to an unprecedented 11.9 million barrels per day. U.S. shale oil tends to be light and sweet in its quality, resulting in a high yield of distillate fuels such as gasoline. “The global oil slate has shifted from majority sour to lighter, sweeter barrels. U.S. shale has been the main driver of this,” said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker with Starfuels in Dubai.  Adding to the overproduction by refiners are concerns that fuel consumption will decline because of a global economic slowdown. In New York Harbor, unusual amounts of tankers are being forced to idle in the region’s anchorages until onshore storage opens up, according to three trading sources. There were at least 12 fuel tankers idling around ports in New York Harbor on Thursday, Refinitiv ship-tracking data showed. In Europe, gasoline margins dropped to seven-year lows of minus $3.80 a barrel this week. “It’s hard to make the case for taking a bullish position on the paper market now,” a European gasoline trader said. Traders expect the glut in Europe to ease slightly as refinery maintenance season begins. Work starting on Friday at Europe’s largest refinery, Royal Dutch Shell’s Pernis, will involve shutting the plant’s gasoline unit, among others. But the restart next month of a huge gasoline-making unit at ADNOC’s Ruwais refinery in the United Arab Emirates, idled due to a fire for more than two years, will add to the supply length in the market.  In Asia, gasoline margins in the Singapore trading hub are also negative, hitting minus $2.12 per barrel on Thursday, the lowest level since 2011. Singapore’s onshore light distillates stocks, which comprise mostly gasoline and blending components, this month hit record highs of around 16 million barrels, data from Enterprise Singapore showed. Beyond a slowdown in demand, Asia’s gasoline glut is a result of surging exports from China, where refineries are producing more fuel than the country can absorb. Gasoline markets could get some relief in the next few months as refiners perform their spring turnaround, reducing the amount of fuel produced, with some traders expecting slightly longer-than-needed outages as refiners pare stocks. “I wouldn’t be surprised if some maintenance outages last a little bit longer than usual so stocks can be used down a bit,” a fuel trader in Singapore said.

2019-01-25,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary is working to modify financing for a nuclear plant being built by Russia so it only starts repaying the loan once the two reactors begin supplying power, a Hungarian minister said, after an EU review of the plans contributed to delays in the project. The existing 2 Gigawatt Paks plant, which accounts for half of Hungary’s power capacity and meets a third of consumption, started up in the 1980s and will be decommissioned in the 2030s. Hungary awarded Russia’s state-owned Rosatom a contract to build a similar-sized plant to replace the existing one, but construction has faced long delays, partly because of a European Union review of the project, including the way it was funded. “Once we know the deadlines for the technical contract, we will modify this (financing) contract,” said Janos Suli, the minister in charge of the project, adding that this would meet procedures set by the EU executive. “We will begin repaying instalments once the blocks begin production,” he said. “There is no damage, no extra payment involved, only a rescheduling of the financial payments.” He said the Russian and Hungarian finance ministries were working to modify funding arrangements. Hungarian Finance Minster Mihaly Varga would travel to Moscow to finalise the changes for Hungary’s parliament to approve, Suli added. After parliament voted to build new nuclear capacity in 2009, Prime Minister Viktor Orban bypassed an international tender and signed a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The move drew international criticism, especially from the United States, which is concerned about Central and Eastern Europe’s heavy reliance on Russian energy sources. Under the deal, Moscow will build two reactors to supply the capacity and offered a 10 billion euro (8.66 billion pounds) state loan to help finance the 12.5 billion euro project. The Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development said Hungary’s decision to choose Russian technology was understandable, given Moscow’s track record and stable supply chain. “The market has many competitors but Russia is one of the strongest,” the head of the OECD’s nuclear energy agency, William Magwood, said. “Other countries will have to find a way to be competitive with Russian suppliers.” Reporting by Marton Dunai; Editing by Jason Neely and Edmund Blair",https://uk.reuters.com/article/hungary-nuclearpower-financing/update-1-hungary-working-to-modify-funding-for-russian-built-nuclear-plant-idUKL8N1ZP1YF,25 Jan 2019,"Hungary is working to modify

2019-01-25,"SALZGITTER, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen will manufacture electric car batteries and charging stations in its home region in Germany, as it prepares to mass produce electric vehicles and overhaul its components division, which makes engines and steering parts.  Volkswagen (VW) said on Friday it would invest 870 million euros ($985 million) by 2020 to developing e-vehicle components, adding the batteries business would manufacture battery cells and packs as well as overseeing recycling of old cells. The German carmaker, which is headquartered in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, also said it would start producing mobile electric car charging stations at its nearby plant in Hannover, which currently makes engines and castings. VW will bundle cells from electric car batteries into storage powerbanks that can be used to recharge up to 15 electric cars at a time and be transported to locations where power is needed, such as a stadium during a rock concert. Customers can find the mobile charging stations using an app on their smartphone, it said.  “It can be set up flexibly and independent of the power supply wherever it is needed: for example, in public parking lots in the city, on company premises, or as a temporary charging point at large-scale events,” VW said. A depleted charging point could be exchanged for a new one, or the station could be permanently attached to the power supply to recharge itself, VW added. The battery charging station would allow VW to store solar and wind energy, and could recharge itself during off-peak hours, helping to ease strain on the power grid, the carmaker said. The first mobile charging stations will be set up this year in VW’s hometown of Wolfsburg and rolled out to other cities in 2020.

2019-01-25,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s Scatec Solar expects to sign several deals to supply corporate clients this year as the price of its solar power becomes more competitive, the chief executive said on Friday. Scatec Solar, which aims to operate 3.5 gigawatt (GW) of capacity around the world by the end of 2021, said it was in talks on several potential deals to supply between 50 megawatts (MW) and 200 MW, similar to the scale of contracts with utilities. “We expect 2019 to be a breakthrough for corporate power purchase agreements,” Chief Executive Raymond Carlsen told a news conference. Despite the size of the potential deals, corporate buyers would likely seek shorter terms than the 20 to 25-year contracts typically agreed with public utilities, he said. The company said costs of the unit over the lifetime of a generating asset, known as “levelised costs”, had fallen by 83 percent since 2010, making solar more competitive. “The costs of power produced from solar is at or below the level of energy from other types of sources. If you can offer the lowest prices, people are not going to overlook it, they will be interested,” Carlsen told Reuters. Scatec has 584 MW of installed capacity and 1.1 GW under construction, including a 400 MW solar plant in Egypt. It expects to reach 3.5 GW by 2021, while its total pipeline of new projects due to become operational by 2021 and beyond now stands at 4.5 GW. Carlsen said he had particular ambitions in South Africa, which will soon unveil a new energy plan. Asian countries, such as Vietnam, were also expected to boost renewable energy to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, he said. Carlsen said the company was looking at more projects where it would cooperate with Norwegian oil and gas firm Equinor, which is seeking to expand its renewable business and has taken a 10 percent stake in Scatec. The two firms are already working together to develop solar power plants in Brazil and Argentina. “We are in a very strong growth mode,” Carlsen said, adding that Scatec expected total proportionate power production to rise to 575-625 GWh in 2019 from 318 GWh in 2018. The proportionate production numbers are based on Scatec’s economic interest in subsidiaries. The company’s consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose to 257 million Norwegian crowns ($30 million) in the fourth quarter from 207 million a year ago. Scatec’s shares rose 9.4 percent in early trade to an all-time high of 82.9 Norwegian crowns. China’s GCL System Integration Technology Co, one of the world’s top solar panel manufacturers, said this week that the solar power industry was about to lose a major competitive windfall as prices of Chinese-made panels begin to recover after a collapse last year.

2019-01-25,"LONDON (Reuters) - Energy companies are flooding Europe with U.S. natural gas, establishing a foothold in a market dominated by Russia and seen as a key battleground in Washington’s efforts to curb Moscow’s energy influence. Europe is now the top buyer of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) after a near fivefold spike in U.S. LNG sales to the continent this winter, overtaking South Korea and Mexico, a Reuters analysis showed. Profit rather than politics is driving the increase, despite pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump for Europe to wean itself off Russian gas.  Energy companies have switched sales to Europe after prices in Asia fell sharply on lower-than-expected demand. Prices in Europe, traditionally seen as a market of last resort, have held firm. “It’s all about commercial reasons,” said James Henderson, director of the natural gas research programme at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. “U.S. LNG will go where there is the biggest margin.” “There is no political motive here.” U.S. LNG shipments to Europe totalled 3.23 million tonnes, or 48 cargoes, in October to January, compared to 0.7 million tonnes, or nine cargoes, a year ago. The United States is currently second only to Qatar, the world’s largest LNG producer, as an LNG supplier to Europe, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. The figures have not previously been reported.  LNG is natural gas frozen to a liquid state so that it can be transported in tankers. The industry is burgeoning, buoyed by demand from China, where the government is pushing to cut carbon emissions, partly by swapping from coal-generated power to gas. Traders had expected Chinese demand to soar again this winter but Beijing had bought cargoes well in advance and so far, a mild winter has kept stocks high.A 10 percent tariff imposed by Beijing on U.S. LNG imports during a trade war also hurt. Awash in supply, sellers of U.S. LNG have pivoted to Europe, where pipeline gas from Russia dominates. Gazprom pumps 190 billion cubic metres, or the equivalent of 145 million tonnes a year (mtpa) to Europe, four times the current capacity of all U.S. LNG export terminals. A new pipeline, Nord Stream 2, will allow Russia to export even more gas to Germany, the largest consumer, although Washington is trying to halt work on the project. LNG offers countries an alternative to piped gas and forces Russia to compete on price. In response, Russia has joined the European LNG market through the Arctic Yamal production plant led by Novatek and is poised to become the world’s fifth largest LNG producer in 2019, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Since December, however, U.S. LNG has outgunned supply from Yamal into Europe, the Refinitiv Eikon data showed.  Technological developments have enabled the United States to unlock cheap, abundant shale gas supplies and, after starting from scratch in 2016, it is expected to have enough capacity by the end of this year to make it the world’s third largest LNG exporter behind Australia and Qatar. Cheniere Energy, the top operator of U.S. terminals, added a fifth production line, or train, to its Louisiana Sabine Pass terminal in November, increasing capacity to 26 mtpa and commissioned a new 5.0 mtpa facility in Texas. Dominion Energy’s 5.8 mtpa Cove Point plant opened last March. Up to 14 new facilities are expected to start up this year at three new terminals and one existing one. A flourishing export business helps Washington’s goal of reducing Europe’s dependence on Russian gas. Last year, Trump used trade negotiations to pressure the European Union to buy more U.S. gas. But with the exception of Poland and Lithuania, which have linked their purchases of LNG explicitly to national security, market forces are the biggest factor in sales. In December and January, the Dutch gas price, which is used as a benchmark for LNG delivered to continental Europe, had been at the highest level since the winter of 2013-2014 at around $7.7 per million British thermal units (MmBtu), compared to previous winter seasons. Rising coal and carbon prices as well as expectations of cold weather have driven them up. In contrast, Asian spot prices for LNG dropped in December and January to their lowest level since the winter of 2015-16, averaging $8.8 MmBtu as the anticipated surge in demand failed to materialise. That cut the premium on sales to Asia over Europe to just above $1 MmBtu from close to $4 MmBtu last winter, insufficient to cover shipping costs.  Europe may not remain the top market for U.S. LNG, particularly if gas consumption in Asia spikes over the summer due to demand for air conditioning. In addition to Russia, Europe is also well supplied with gas from Norway, the Netherlands and Algeria and its use of coal, nuclear and wind to generate power means its demand for gas, used in some types of power stations, can be extremely flexible. Still, many European utilities have long-term agreements with U.S. producers Cheniere, Dominion and Sempra Energy whose Cameron LNG plant is due to start this year. Britain’s Centrica will start taking LNG from Cheniere’s Sabine Pass in September and the company confirmed to Reuters that it had been buying U.S. cargos this winter. Spain’s Naturgy, Iberdrola and Endesa also have contracts with Cheniere starting this year. “Much of the American LNG is looking for alternative markets aside from the Asian continent and, thanks to lower transport costs, Europe is the market that has benefited most,” said Jose Simón, senior vice president of Global Gas at Iberdrola. A spokesman for Endesa said U.S. gas had become more competitive. Naturgy, an early buyer from Cheniere, confirmed it has been selling U.S. cargoes into Europe this winter. France’s Total and EDF and Italy’s ENI have U.S. contracts too. They did not respond to requests for comment. And if Asian demand fails to materialise this summer, Europe is always an option. “Because of the amount of available capacity into Europe and the fact that it’s a price-sensitive, demand-elastic kind of market, if you can’t find a better market ... into China, Korea, the assumption is you can always push it into Europe,” said Jason Freer, Global Head of Business Intelligence at Poten & Partners, an energy and shipping consultancy.

2019-01-25,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Sinopec Corp , Asia’s top refiner, said on Friday its trading unit Unipec lost 4.65 billion yuan ($687 million) on crude oil hedging in the fourth quarter, a month after it suspended two top executives at the unit. In late December, Sinopec suspended Unipec President Chen Bo, an industry veteran who helped the company become one of the world’s largest oil traders, and a senior Communist Party representative at the company, for unspecified trading losses. The massive trading loss pulled down the refiner’s fourth quarter profits, although its annual result still reached its best finish since 2013. “Investigations have shown Unipec has applied some inappropriate trading strategies in hedging crude oil business,” the company said in a filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange after the markets closed on Friday. “Because of wrong calls on the oil price moves, (the company) incurred losses on the futures side of the hedging when oil prices fell,” Sinopec said in the statement. Sinopec reported 62.39 billion yuan ($9.2 billion) in net profit for 2018, up 22 percent from the previous year, data from the filling showed. Total revenue also rose 22 percent in 2018 to reach 2.88 trillion yuan for the full year, Sinopec said. Fourth quarter net income, however, was only 2.41 billion yuan, Reuters calculations based on the filing showed, down 86 percent from the fourth quarter of 2017. This marks Sinopec’s worst quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2015. Revenue in the last quarter of 2018 rose to 808.6 billion yuan from 615.2 billion yuan in the same period a year earlier. $1 = 6.7621 yuan

The euro recovered lost ground against the dollar after falling to its lowest in six weeks following Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting. European markets opened firmer, with the automakers and tech sector indices rising 1.5 percent and 1 percent respectively. The pan-European STOXX index hit its highest since Dec. 4, up 0.8 percent on the day. The gains came as stocks rose overnight in Asia and the United States on the back of strong earnings from U.S. tech firms. MSCI’s All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.3 percent on the day. But the gauge was set to break a four-week streak of gains as weak economic data and cautious soundings from central banks pulled the index half a percent down on the week. Data at the start of the week showed China’s economy grew at its slowest in 28 years in 2018, while purchasing manager indexes in Germany and the euro zone indicated stagnation in the bloc. On Thursday, the European Central Bank alluded to downside risks to growth for the first time in its statement since April 2017, while Germany cut its economic growth forecast for 2019. Sombre news continued to trickle in on Friday, with German business morale falling for the fifth month in a row in January according to the Ifo business climate index. According to the latest Reuters polls of hundreds of economists from around the world, a synchronised global economic slowdown is underway and any escalation in the U.S.-China trade war would trigger a sharper downturn. Investors seemed to view the glass as half-full. In a note to clients, UBS Global Wealth Management’s chief investment officer Mark Haefele said that rhetoric on U.S.-China trade has become more positive, and that Beijing has taken steps to stimulate its economy. “While economic and earnings growth is slowing, we believe it is unlikely that growth will drop far below trend,” he said. “At the same time, there are reasons to be cautious about policymakers’ ability to follow through on their rhetoric.” Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on Jan. 30 and 31 for the next round of trade negotiations with Washington. The two sides are “miles and miles” from resolving trade issues but there is a fair chance they will get a deal, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday. In currencies, the dollar fell 0.2 percent against a basket of peers to 96.422. The euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.13280, recovering from a six-week low hit in the wake of ECB President Mario Draghi’s downbeat comments on Thursday. The ECB’s post-meeting statement for the first time since April 2017 alluded to downside risks to growth. The British pound was up 0.2 percent at $1.3076 after brushing a two-month high of $1.3140, lifted after The Sun reported on Thursday that Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party has privately decided to back May’s Brexit deal next week if it includes a clear time limit to the Irish backstop. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield was slightly higher at 2.729 percent after dropping to a one-week low as pessimism over global growth supported safe-haven government debt. Crude oil extended gains after rallying the previous day as the United States threatened sanctions on Venezuela’s crude exports as the country descended further into political and economic turmoil. U.S. crude oil futures were up 0.7 percent at $61.52 per barrel after gaining 1 percent on Thursday.

2019-01-25,"(Repeats with no changes) BOGOTA, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Colombia has extended coal miner Drummond’s license to operate its La Loma mine for an additional 20 years, the national mining agency said on Thursday. The contract at the mine, located in northeastern Cesar province, will generate at least $586 million in royalties, income and social project investment during its lifetime, the agency said in a statement on its website. Drummond is Colombia’s largest exporter of coal. The new contract will begin in May, Drummond said in a statement. The company has operated the mine for more than 30 years and along with its transportation operations provides some 5,200 direct jobs, it added. “This contract represented 30 percent of Drummond’s mining operation production in 2018 in Colombia,” the company said. “The area of this renewed concession has proven reserves of approximately 60.5 million tons.” Besides Drummond, the biggest players in Colombia’s coal industry are Glencore’s Prodeco, Murray Energy Corp’s Colombia Natural Resources, and Cerrejon, which is jointly owned by BHP Billiton, Anglo American Plc and Glencore.

2019-01-25,"KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Two more demonstrators died in unrest that began last month and raged across Sudanese cities on Thursday in the most sustained challenge yet to the three-decade rule of Omar al-Bashir..  A 24-year-old man died from his wounds in Omdurman, across the Nile from the capital Khartoum. The second victim, the son of a well-known footballer, had been at a protest at a private university in Khartoum.  That two deaths, confirmed in a government statement released late on Thursday, took the official death toll from unrest since Dec. 19 to 30. Rights groups have put the total at more than 40. Trouble raged into the night in Omdurman, with smoke billowing over a street barricaded by steel poles, burning tyres and tree branches. In Khartoum, security forces fired tear gas at protesters in various neighbourhoods, witnesses said. At night, smoke wafted over Khartoum, fires burned and a main street was blocked. There were also protests in the eastern cities of Port Sudan and al-Qadarif, where hundreds gathered in the main market area, chanting “Down, that’s it! Freedom, freedom.” The opposition Sudanese Professionals’ Association, a union that has led calls for demonstrations, had urged protesters to rally from early afternoon and march to Bashir’s palace on the banks of the Nile. The group said on its social media sites that protesters had gathered in cities including Madani and Sennar south of Khartoum as well as smaller towns. Many protests were reported in Gezira state and witnesses said demonstrators had blocked the main road in al-Nuba district, also south of Khartoum. Security forces have used tear gas, stun grenades and live ammunition to disperse demonstrations, as well as arresting hundreds of protesters and opposition figures. Authorities have blamed the unrest on “infiltrators” and foreign agents, and said they are taking steps to resolve Sudan’s economic problems.

2019-01-25,"* Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Spreadbetters expect European stocks to open higher * Asia stocks hit 7-week high, supported after U.S. techs surge * Markets brace for events such as U.S.-China trade talks * Euro near 6-week low after dovish comments from ECB Draghi * Crude boosted as U.S. threatens Venezuela with sanctions By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rallied to a seven-week high on Friday, buoyed by gains in U.S. technology firms as pockets of strength in corporate earnings eased some of the anxiety over a slowing global economy. Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open slightly higher, with Britain’s FTSE adding 0.2 percent, Germany’s DAX gaining 0.6 percent and France’s CAC advancing 0.45 percent. The euro hovered near a six-week low versus the dollar following dovish-sounding comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, who expressed concerns about the euro zone economy. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained more than 1 percent to scale its highest since Dec. 4. The index was headed for a gain of 0.8 percent this week, with shifting sentiment around Sino-U.S. trade talks partly helping to offset growing concerns over slowing global economic growth. The Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.9 percent after regulators announced new measures to strengthen Chinese banks’ capital. Tech-heavy South Korean shares added 1.4 percent. Australian stocks climbed 0.7 percent, lifted by higher prices of commodities such as iron ore and crude oil. Japan’s Nikkei advanced 1 percent with technology companies boosted by a surge in their U.S. peers. “Investors who were already excited about the U.S. chip sector’s earnings the day before got even more reassured after they saw how their stocks moved,” said Shogo Maekawa, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. Maekawa added that a recovery in the global cyclical chip sector is taken as a silver-lining amid concerns about a cooling world economic momentum. According to the latest Reuters polls of hundreds of economists from around the world, a synchronised global economic slowdown is under way and any escalation in the U.S.-China trade war would trigger a sharper downturn. “Equities may be drawing some support but the markets are bracing for next week’s events,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. “The U.S.-China trade discussions will provide insight into how talks are progressing, while the British parliamentary voting is a key Brexit event. And there is also the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting.” Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on Jan. 30 and 31 for the next round of trade negotiations with Washington. The two sides are “miles and miles” from resolving trade issues but there is a fair chance they will get a deal, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday. The British parliament will debate and vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit “plan B” on Jan. 29, and the U.S. Federal Reserve concludes a two-day policy setting meeting on Jan. 30. The Nasdaq had risen roughly 0.7 percent on Thursday thanks to a rally by chipmakers, while the S&P 500 edged higher and the Dow closed nominally lower as anxiety about slowing global growth and the Sino-U.S. trade dispute undercut a spate of strong earnings. In currency markets, the euro crawled up 0.1 percent to $1.1321 after dropping 0.7 percent overnight. It was still in close reach of a six-week trough of $1.1289 plumbed overnight. The euro was down 0.4 percent this week. The single currency slid after ECB President Draghi acknowledged on Thursday that economic growth in the euro zone was likely to be weaker than earlier expected due to the fall-out from factors ranging from China’s slowdown to Brexit. Germany has cut its economic growth forecast for 2019 to 1.0 percent from 1.8 percent due to slower global economic growth and uncertainty about Britain’s exit from the European Union, the Handelsblatt newspaper reported on Thursday. The ECB had left its policy stance unchanged as expected on Thursday and Draghi’s downbeat comments added to speculation that the central bank will hold back on interest rate hikes that some market watchers had expected in October. The pound was up 0.5 percent at $1.3127 after brushing a two-month high of $1.3140, lifted after The Sun reported on Thursday that Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party has privately decided to back May’s Brexit deal next week if it includes a clear time limit to the Irish backstop. The dollar nudged up 0.15 percent to 109.78 yen and on track to end the week little changed. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield was slightly higher at 2.729 percent after dropping to a one-week low as pessimism over global growth supported safe-haven government debt. Crude oil extended gains after rallying the previous day as the United States threatened sanctions on Venezuela’s crude exports as the country descended further into political and economic turmoil. U.S. crude oil futures were up 1.3 percent at $53.83 per barrel after gaining 1 percent on Thursday.
