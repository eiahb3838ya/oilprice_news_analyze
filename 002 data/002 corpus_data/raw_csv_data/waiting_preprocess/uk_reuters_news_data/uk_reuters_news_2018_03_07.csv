2018-03-07,"(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp’s XTO Energy unit said on Wednesday it plugged a blown out natural gas well in rural southeast Ohio that had been leaking for nearly three weeks. The Feb. 15 blowout in Belmont County had spewed millions of cubic feet of gas into the air, triggering evacuations of nearby residences and raising concerns among environmental groups about health and environmental impacts. Exposure to low levels of natural gas is not harmful to human health, according to the National Institutes of Health, but extremely high levels can cause loss of consciousness or death by displacing oxygen. “We would like to press for a full accounting of the damage,” said Melanie Houston, director of climate programs for the Ohio Environmental Council, an environmental advocacy group.  XTO spokeswoman Karen Matusic said the company could not immediately say how much gas leaked from the well, which was about to be put into production after being drilled and fracked.  An initial report from the Environmental Protection Agency on Feb. 17 estimated the natural gas flow rate from the well at 100 million cubic feet per day. Earthworks, an environmental group, compared the magnitude of the XTO well blowout with some of the biggest methane releases in the United States. Matusic said the company has been taking air samples since the blowout and “never picked up anything that would harm humans or animals.” Following the well blowout, emergency responders evacuated about 30 homes within one mile of the well. Residents of all but four homes located within a half mile of the well were able to return home within a few days, Matusic said. Ohio Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is the lead government agency at the XTO well pad. Officials at the DNR were not immediately available for comment  The U.S. EPA said it responded to a fire at the well on Feb. 15 to provide technical assistance and air monitoring at the site. Because there were no apparent release of oil or hazardous substances, the EPA said it demobilized on Feb. 21. An unknown quantity of brine and produced water, estimated to be more than 5,000 gallons, was initially discharged to streams that flow into the Ohio River, according to the EPA.  Protected wildlife species located in proximity to or downstream from the well site are the Eastern Hellbender Salamander, Northern longeared bat, and protected fish.

2018-03-07,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - The U.S. energy secretary blasted renewable fuels champions on Wednesday while the head of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) urged the energy sector to focus on global efforts to cut carbon emissions, reflecting a yawning trans-Atlantic gap on climate issues. Speaking at the CERAWeek conference in Houston, Shell CEO Ben van Beurden outlined an ambitious plan to reduce the Anglo-Dutch company’s carbon footprint and expand in renewables, and called on others to follow. “The energy landscape is changing fast. So we must change, where change is what the world needs,” van Beurden said. Shell and European peers including BP Plc (BP.L), France’s Total SA (TOTF.PA) and Norway’s Statoil STL.OL are becoming increasingly active in low-carbon energy and are vocal supporters of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Until recently, climate has been less prominent in strategy presentations from U.S. rivals Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N). The United States, under former President Barack Obama, helped negotiate the Paris agreement which calls for a gradual shift to renewable energy by the end of the century. President Donald Trump decided to withdraw last year. Van Beurden gave an unusually strong-worded speech calling climate the biggest challenge facing the energy sector. “There may not be total unity behind the Paris Agreement any longer, but there is no other issue with the potential to disrupt our industry on such a deep and fundamental level.” U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry struck a starkly different tone, blasting the 2015 agreement to limit global warming. Perry said it was “immoral” to say people should live without fossil fuels. “We are passionate about renewable energy. But the world, especially developing economies, will continue to need fossil fuels, as over a billion people on the planet live without access to electricity,” Perry said. Perry extolled growing U.S. energy independence, as a boom in onshore shale drilling led to a rapid growth in oil as well as natural gas, the least polluting fossil fuel.  The rise of gas at the expense of dirtier coal helped the world’s biggest economy sharply reduce its carbon emissions over the last decade, as gas displaced much domestic coal demand. “The lesson is clear (that) we don’t have to choose between growing our economy and caring for our environment, by embracing innovation over regulation we can benefit from both,” Perry said. Perry said at a later panel that Trump thought that the costs were not worth staying in the Paris agreement. Executives at the Houston conference repeatedly noted growing demand for fossil fuels, and downplayed the overall viability of renewable energy or electric vehicles, noting emissions would continue to rise even if there was 100 percent adoption of electric vehicles. On Wednesday, Mary Barra, chief executive officer of General Motors Co (GM.N), said the company’s “commitment to an all-electric, zero-emissions future is unwavering, regardless of any modifications to future fuel economy standards.” She said Congress should expand tax credits for electric vehicles.  Other executives spoke of moving to carbon capture technologies and carbon taxes. Robert Dudley, president of BP, said Tuesday that “at some point in the future a price on carbon has to be part of this answer.”      The projected growth of oil demand is “definitely not in line with the Paris climate goals,” said International Energy Agency Executive Director Fatih Birol, saying the industry must start using carbon capture sequestration (CCS) technologies.  In New York on Wednesday, Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods echoed Perry’s words at the company’s investor day, noting developing nations need solutions to generate more electricity.  Like others, Woods said Exxon advocates a carbon tax to limit emissions. “By and large, we don’t see enough incentives to grow CCS in the marketplace,” Peter Trelenberg, Exxon’s manager of environmental policy and planning, said. Few in Houston were as emphatic as van Beurden, who outlined how Shell is moving to meet its targets to halve carbon emissions by 2050. Steps include limiting emissions from operations and boosting natural gas production to reach 75 percent of company oil and gas output.  “Over time, this net carbon footprint ambition will transform our company’s product mix,” van Beurden said.

2018-03-07,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday said Congress must find a way to pay for a massive looming shortfall in funding to pay for crumbling highways, bridges and other infrastructure. Representative Bill Shuster, who chairs the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said at a hearing he is working to find a “big broad bipartisan infrastructure bill” but acknowledged new revenue must be found. Congress has transferred nearly $140 billion to the Highway Trust Fund since 2008. In order to maintain current spending levels, lawmakers would need to approve an additional $107 billion from 2021 through 2026. Some lawmakers suggested hiking the federal gasoline tax, which at 18.4-cent-a-gallon has not been raised since 1993 and rising U.S. vehicle fuel efficiency is reducing revenue to pay for road repairs.  While some 31 states have hiked gasoline taxes since 2012,  many key Republicans in Congress strongly oppose a federal gasoline tax hike. “There’s been no political price to pay,” Shuster said, for state politicians hiking gasoline taxes. He said Congress will pay a “price” if they do not have a funding fix. “We are already paying it in congestion, bad roads and failing bridges.” President Donald Trump last month endorsed hiking the federal gasoline tax by 25 cents a gallon in a meeting with lawmakers about funding his infrastructure spending proposal, a Democratic lawmaker said. He has not endorsed it publicly and the White House would not confirm or deny the report. “If you don’t increase taxes we’re not having an infrastructure bill and we’re doing nothing,” Representative Peter DeFazio, the top Democrat on the panel, said at the hearing. “We have to have real money.” The American Trucking Associations and U.S. Chamber of Commerce both testified in favor of boosting gasoline taxes on Wednesday. But Representative Sam Graves, a Missouri Republican, said there is little chance of winning support in the House to hike gasoline taxes, but said a solution must be found. “There simply isn’t any money left under the couch cushions,” he said. Trump wants to use $200 billion in federal funds to try to stimulate $1.5 trillion in infrastructure improvements over 10 years but would cut an equivalent amount in projected infrastructure spending from the federal budget as it shifted more costs to states and cities. Senate Democrats Wednesday proposed $1 trillion in new federal spending paid for by repealing some tax cuts approved in December. Trump would make it easier for states to impose new tolls. Last month, the White House praised an experimental program in Oregon that charges a mileage tax to volunteer drivers. But ramping that up nationally could take a decade, experts testified Wednesday. Congressional aides say it is looks increasingly unlikely that a major infrastructure package will be approved this year, citing the pending November elections and a glut of issues on the calendar.

2018-03-07,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A key gauge of world stock markets slipped on Wednesday but ended far above session lows, as fears that U.S. President Donald Trump will proceed with protectionist tariffs and risk a global trade war were tempered by signs the move could include carve-outs for key partners. Stocks and the U.S. dollar recovered most of the day’s losses after the White House said proposed steel and aluminum tariffs could exclude Mexico, Canada and possibly other countries. Trading was volatile through the session as some investors wagered that even with the departure of Trump’s chief economic adviser Gary Cohn, until now a key ally of free markets inside the White House, the president’s hard talk on trade could be a tactic amid ongoing agreement negotiations. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a media briefing “there are potential carve-outs for Mexico and Canada based on national security, and possibly other countries as well.” A ceremony for Trump to sign a document to set steel and aluminum tariffs is planned for Thursday afternoon, a source told Reuters. The Mexican peso and Canadian dollar recovered from steep losses, with the peso turning higher against the greenback after Sanders’ comments. Against the greenback, the Mexican peso gained 0.15 percent to 18.71. The Canadian dollar was down 0.21 percent to 1.29 per U.S. dollar. “It makes investors less worried if the tariff isn’t applied so broadly,” said Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. “But it’s speculation at this point. We have nothing in writing. If there’s one thing we’ve learned from this administration it’s that it could change by the time it’s in writing.”  The overall outlook for the U.S. currency was downbeat, despite the mixed sentiment over trade policy. Goldman Sachs economists wrote that tariffs similar to those proposed by Trump have usually been associated with subsequent currency weakness. “We therefore see the latest news as an additional reason to remain cautious on the outlook for the broad dollar,” Goldman economists Zach Pandl and Karen Reichgott wrote. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other major currencies, fell 0.04 percent, with the euro up 0.09 percent to $1.2413. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.02 percent versus the greenback at 106.10 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3905, up 0.14 percent on the day. Losses on the S&P 500 were as deep as 1 percent at one point, but ebbed and flowed as traders sought clues on the future of trade policy in the day’s headlines. U.S. indexes rose sharply after Sanders’ comments.     Equities also got a bid earlier after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who favors strong tariffs, said in a Bloomberg interview he was not a candidate to replace Cohn. “The market sees him (Navarro) as a very protectionist type. If he’s not in the running, the market seems to like that,” said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial in Utah, said that with Trump keeping a close eye on stock indexes, selling sparked by tariff and trade war talks could change the president’s mind. “Indeed, here is a president who judges his success by using the stock market as an important barometer for that. So if the market votes an overwhelming vote of no confidence on these tariffs, is there a chance that things change next week?” “I suspect that it’s still a fluid situation,” Ware said.     The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 82.76 points, or 0.33 percent, to 24,801.36, the S&P 500 lost 1.32 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,726.8 and the Nasdaq Composite added 24.64 points, or 0.33 percent, to 7,396.65. European car makers ended up 0.6 percent after  dropping more than 1 percent on the risk of a hike in tariffs on exports to the United States. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.12 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index earlier closed up 0.35 percent.     Emerging market stocks lost 0.40 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.58 percent lower, while Japan’s Nikkei  percent. Oil prices fell after U.S. government data showed an increase in inventories, with Washington’s plans for import tariffs weighing further on investor sentiment. U.S. crude fell 2.01 percent to $61.34 per barrel and Brent was last at $64.51, down 1.95 percent. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last fell 2/32 in price to yield 2.8827 percent, from 2.877 percent late on Tuesday. The 30-year bond last fell 9/32 in price to yield 3.1506 percent, from 3.136 percent late on Tuesday. Spot gold  percent to $1,325.29 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.67 percent to $1,326.20.

2018-03-07,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (GM.N) Chief Executive Mary Barra called on the U.S. Congress on Wednesday to expand a consumer tax credit for electric vehicles as the automaker said it would boost production of its EV Chevrolet Bolt in response to strong demand. Barra also called on U.S. regulators to take into account when scoring automakers’ emissions the potential for autonomous ridesharing vehicles to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and petroleum consumption. The Trump administration is reviewing whether Obama administration emissions standards that called for roughly doubling average U.S. vehicle fuel efficiency by 2025 are appropriate. “We feel tax credits should be expanded so our customers continue to receive the benefit going forward,” Barra told an energy conference in Houston. “We believe in an all-electric future.” GM has sold more than 160,000 plug-in and full-electric vehicles eligible for the credit. The $7,500 consumer tax credit phases out over a 12-month-period soon after an automaker hits the 200,000 mark and the largest U.S. automaker is expected to hit the mark later this year. The tax credit is aimed at helping defray the cost of pricier electric vehicles. Introduced in October 2016, the Bolt was the first mass-produced electric vehicle to go more than 200 miles (320 km) between charges, and sell at a sticker price of under $40,000. Electrically powered vehicles account for a just a fraction of GM’s overall sales. In 2017, an analyst estimated GM loses $7,400 on every Bolt it sells. GM does not disclose individual vehicle profitability, company spokesman Pat Morrissey said by phone. GM sold about 26,000 Bolt EVs worldwide last year, mostly in the United States. The company declined to say how much it would hike production when it adds production later this year at an assembly plant north of Detroit. Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) said last month it expected to reach the 200,000 figure later this year. Congress opted not to kill the tax credit as part of a tax overhaul passed in December, but did not act on a proposal that would have lifted the cap entirely but then sunset the credit in a few years.  GM said in October it planned to launch 20 new electric vehicles by 2023, but did not provide more specifics. Automakers around the world are investing tens of billions collectively to electrify vehicles. Automakers want the Trump administration to revise the 2022 through 2025 fuel efficiency standards. The administration must determine by April 1 whether the standards are appropriate, and regulators are expected to declare they are not.  Administration officials are considering proposing a significant reduction in the requirements, according to automakers and government officials. “We also feel the regulations need to comprehend new developments in the industry – like the move away from one owner, one vehicle – that have taken place since the rule was finalized in 2012,” Barra said. “Current standards did not comprehend increased shared and autonomous electric vehicles.” GM’s “commitment to an all-electric, zero-emissions future is unwavering, regardless of any modifications to future fuel economy standards,” she added.

2018-03-07,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) on Wednesday laid out a goal to double annual earnings by 2025 through heavier investments in a bid to allay investor fears that the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer has seen its best days. But shares still fell to their lowest level in more than two years after the company said the spending would not boost near-term production, and investors who had expected large share buybacks were disappointed that executives did not announce any.  Exxon was once the industry’s profit and cash-flow leader, but sagging output and a sliding share price have pushed total return, or share appreciation plus dividends, into negative territory over the last five years, according to Thomson Reuters data. By comparison, total returns are up 16 percent for Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and 40 percent for Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L). Exxon’s growth plan will require billions of dollars in spending spread across U.S. shale fields, along with refinery expansions and deepwater megaprojects. The company said investments should drive profit to $31 billion in 2025 with crude prices at or above current levels.  It was the first time Irving, Texas-based Exxon has given an earnings forecast so far in advance. Shares closed down 2.5 percent at $74.26, the lowest close since January 2016. Darren Woods, who became chief executive in January 2017 after predecessor Rex Tillerson retired and became the U.S. secretary of state, also said he was committed to being more transparent with investors.  “There’s a lot different today, not just style,” Woods said at the company’s annual analyst day in New York. “My objective is to get this organisation focussed on driving value and turning that value into results that you all will see.” Exxon said projects in Guyana and the Permian Basin region of Texas and New Mexico, as well as refining and chemical plant expansions, should drive earnings gains. Exxon reported an adjusted profit of $15 billion in 2017. To achieve its goals, Exxon said it will boost spending on capital projects to $24 billion this year, $28 billion next year and an average of $30 billion from 2023 to 2025. Meanwhile, peers including Chevron are cutting spending or promising to hold budgets flat. “Capex is the price you pay for cash flow,” said Woods, who added that every dollar in capital spending by Exxon in the past decade has generated $1.20 in operating cash flow. Woods said he expected production to grow about 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), to about 5 million boe/d in 2025 as 25 projects come online.  When an analyst asked if he would resign if the targets were not met, Woods did not directly answer, but said he intended to meet the long-range goals.  Tom Ellacott, senior vice president at consultancy Wood Mackenzie, noted that in the near term, Exxon’s production will be flat, and growth in the next decade will require hitting goals at five key development regions.   In the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield, Exxon plans to triple production by 2025 at recently purchased low-cost acreage. The expansion highlights the increasing importance of U.S. shale alongside the company’s global megaprojects. Several analysts viewed the higher spending as problematic, even as they welcomed the pledge of greater transparency by a company that has been criticized for giving few operations details in recent years. “To us this highlights that there are no easy fixes to rejuvenate Exxon’s portfolio, and it is likely to take time for this investment to flow through into higher earnings, cash flow and returns,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria. Exxon’s operating margin, which measures profit after expenses, dipped to 5.1 percent last year, far below the industry median of 13.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Several analysts pushed Woods for still more transparency, asking him directly to participate in quarterly earnings conference calls. Unlike CEOs of most public companies including oil majors, Exxon CEOs historically have not joined the calls, where analysts can ask for operations details and outlooks. “Please disclose more and meet us more. We would be greatly appreciative,” Wolfe Research analyst Paul Sankey said to Woods at the meeting. Woods did not commit to being on the calls, but said he has been meeting more with investors in the past year. Chevron on Tuesday said it should be able to raise production 4 percent to 7 percent this year and buy back shares for the first time in at least three years even without a substantial rise in oil prices.

2018-03-07,"BRASILIA, March 7 (Reuters) - Aldemir Bendine, the former chief executive of state-controlled oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Banco do Brasil, was found guilty on Wednesday of corruption charges and sentenced by a federal judge to 11 years in prison. Judge Sergio Moro ruled that Bendine used his position at Petrobras to take 3 million reais ($924,527) in bribes from construction firm Odebrecht. “The condemned took his position as CEO of Petrobras amid a corruption scandal and with the expectation that he would solve problems,” Moro wrote in his ruling. “The last behavior one would expect from him would be corruption, once again putting at risk the reputation of the company.” Bendine’s legal team did not immediately reply to requests for comment. His attorneys said throughout the trial that he was innocent and that no company received special benefits from Petrobras or Banco do Brasil under his leadership. He served as CEO of Petrobras, as the company is known, from 2015 to 2016, and was brought in to clean up the firm after its central role in a huge corruption scandal that has embroiled politicians and business executives. Bendine, who led state-owned lender Banco do Brasil from 2009 to 2015, was charged last August. Prosecutors alleged that Bendine sought 17 million reais in bribes when he led Banco do Brasil to authorize the rollover of a loan to Odebrecht. Odebrecht refused to pay him, according to testimony from its executives. Shortly before taking over as head of Petrobras, he demanded and received payment of 3 million reais from Odebrecht so that it could receive unspecified favorable treatment from Petrobras, Moro found in his ruling. $1 = 3.2449 reais

2018-03-07,"EDMONTON, Canada, March 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - S mall island nations are looking to cities for ideas to fight climate change, as they are dealing with problems on a similar scale, said a top minister for the Caribbean nation of St. Lucia on Wednesday. Islands in the Caribbean Sea with populations comparable to mid-sized cities are increasingly seeking guidance from urban leaders rather than those at global gatherings of nations, said Gale Rigobert, St. Lucia’s minister of sustainable development, in an interview. Small islands, especially those of low-lying coral, are on the frontlines of rising sea levels that cause stronger and more frequent more storm surges, wash damaging salt deposits onto cropland and are submerging some land altogether. “As small island states, it is easy for us to be lost in the wider discourse,” Rigobert told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on the sidelines of a United Nations-backed climate summit. Some 750 scientists and city planners from 80 countries are gathered in the western Canadian city of Edmonton to help chart a global roadmap for cities to battle climate change. Small island nations such as Antigua, Barbados, Dominica and St. Lucia are tending to send delegations to such climate meetings for cities, finding them more useful for concrete ideas than nation-based meetings, Rigobert said. As momentum grows behind initiatives by cities battling climate change separately from national governments, Rigobert said St. Lucia is finding solutions tailored to its size. “The beauty of having a city or regional approach is that ... in terms of scale, it allows us for a more immediate comparison,” she said. Last year, agriculture in St. Lucia, a volcanic island in the eastern Caribbean, was badly hit by Hurricane Matthew. Hurricane Tomas in 2010 also caused serious damage. St. Lucia’s population of 170,000 people compares to that of Fort Lauderdale in the U.S. state of Florida, a city hard hit by Hurricane Irma last year. The resemblance gives small islands access to new strategies by cities, Rigobert said, such as high-tech permeable pavements, vegetation-based flood prevention measures and shifts away from fossil fuels. “In terms of practical, pragmatic solutions we’re finding that a city-level engagement is proving to be very tangible, with more immediate results,” she said.

2018-03-07,"(Adds Goldman Sachs declined to comment) BOGOTA, March 7 (Reuters) - Alabama-based coal miner Drummond Co Inc has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc to explore investor interest in the possible sale of at least a portion of its operations in Colombia, sources at Drummond said on Wednesday. Colombia, the world’s fifth-largest exporter of coal, produced 89.4 million tonnes of the fuel last year. Drummond was the country’s largest thermal coal producer and exporter in 2017, with output of 32.4 million tonnes and exports of 32.3 million tonnes. The sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, did not confirm how much of its stake in Colombia the company may want to sell. “They are exploring the interest of investors to see if there is interest in the company’s coal assets in Colombia,” one source said. A press officer at Drummond’s Birmingham, Alabama headquarters said the company had no comment. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Drummond sold 20 percent of its stake in the Andean country for $1.5 billion in 2011 to Japan’s Itochu. The company said at the time it had looked into selling outright. Asia is a major market for Colombian coal. Besides Drummond, the biggest players in Colombia’s coal industry are Glencore Plc, Murray Energy Corp’s Colombia Natural Resources, and Cerrejon, which is jointly owned by BHP Billiton, Anglo American Plc and Glencore.

2018-03-07,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices tumbled on Wednesday as financial markets slid amid concerns that Washington’s plans for import tariffs could spark a trade war, and after U.S. government data showed an increase in crude inventories and output. Brent crude futures for May delivery fell $1.45 to settle at $64.34 a barrel, a 2.20 percent loss. Brent traded between $63.83 and $65.80 during the session.  West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures for April delivery fell $1.45 to settle at $61.15 a barrel. It fell 2.3 percent on the day, its biggest daily percentage loss since Feb. 9, and traded between $60.58 and $62.58. The resignation of Gary Cohn, economic adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, who was seen as a bulwark against protectionist forces in the government, triggered a drop in Wall Street’s three main stock indexes and tempered investor risk appetite. Oil has recently moved in tandem with the equity market.  Cohn’s resignation came after he lost a fight over Trump’s plans for hefty steel and aluminum import tariffs. Major powers, including the European Union and China, have said such tariffs could lead to retaliatory action and trigger a global trade war. “The generalized market anxiety over what could end up being a global trade war is dragging everything down,” said John Kilduff, partner at investment manager Again Capital in New York. “It does not bode well for future economic growth and increased energy demand.” A further increase in U.S. output also weighed on prices.  Weekly data from the U.S. Department of Energy showed weekly U.S. crude production hit a record high last week of almost 10.4 million barrels per day (bpd). “We had the rig count flatten out a bit and start to rise again this year from the oil perspective, so you’re going to continue to see oil production in the U.S. be fairly strong for an extended period of time here,” said Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at energy investment manager Tortoise Capital in Leawood, Kansas. The EIA said on Tuesday it expects U.S. crude output in the fourth quarter of 2018 to reach an average of 11.17 million bpd, up from the previous forecast a month ago of 11.04 million bpd. This would make it a bigger producer than Russia, now ranked No. 1. Last year, the United States surpassed Saudi Arabia, the biggest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Prices briefly pared losses on Wednesday after data from the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude inventories rose by 2.4 million barrels in the last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 2.7 million barrels. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub fell by 605,000 barrels, EIA said, the 11th straight week of declines. While oil stocks typically rise this time of year as refineries frequently close for maintenance, sustained increases in U.S. crude inventories has weighed on sentiment.

2018-03-07,"(Adds details from decision, comments, byline) By Jonathan Stempel March 7 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Wednesday rejected the U.S. government’s bid to halt a lawsuit by young people claiming that President Donald Trump and his administration are violating their constitutional rights by ignoring the harms caused by climate change. By a 3-0 vote, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said the administration had not met the “high bar” under federal law to dismiss the Oregon lawsuit, which was originally brought in 2015 against the administration of President Barack Obama. The potentially far-reaching case is one of a handful seeking to have courts address global warming and its causes. Twenty-one plaintiffs, now aged 10 to 21, accused federal officials and oil industry executives of knowing for decades that carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels destabilize the climate, but refusing to do anything about it. They said this has deprived them of their due process rights to life, liberty and property, including to live in a habitable climate. U.S. District Judge Ann Aiken in Eugene, Oregon in November 2016 refused to dismiss the lawsuit, saying a quick dismissal without addressing the merits could sanction the government’s alleged “knowing decision to poison the air.” In seeking to overturn that ruling, the government said letting the case proceed could lead to burdensome litigation, and provoke a “constitutional crisis” by pitting courts against Trump and the many other Executive Branch officials named as defendants. But in Wednesday’s decision, Chief Judge Sidney Thomas said the dismissal request was premature, and deciding whether the plaintiffs’ claims were too broad could be addressed through the normal legal process. “Litigation burdens are part of our legal system, and the defendants still have the usual remedies before the district court for nonmeritorious litigation,” Thomas wrote. “C1aims and remedies often are vastly narrowed as litigation proceeds; we have no reason to assume this case will be any different.” The U.S. Department of Justice, which handled the government appeal, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Julia Olson, who represented the plaintiffs and is executive director of Our Children’s Trust, which advocates for improving the climate, in an interview welcomed the decision. “It’s very exciting,” she said. “It will be the first time that climate science and the federal government’s role in creating its dangers will go on trial in a U.S. court.” The lawsuit was returned to Aiken for further proceedings.

2018-03-07,"(Updates prices, changes comments, byline, dateline, previous LONDON) * U.S. data drags crude prices lower * U.S. stocks off lows; Europe edges up * Steel stocks rally on Wall Street By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters) - A key gauge of world stock markets slipped on Wednesday after a strong advocate of free trade resigned from the White House, fanning fears that U.S. President Donald Trump will proceed with protectionist tariffs and risk a global trade war. But the U.S. dollar recovered most of its overnight losses as some investors wagered that even with the departure of Trump’s chief economic adviser Gary Cohn, the president’s hard talk could be a tactic amid ongoing trade negotiations with Canada and Mexico. Oil prices fell more than 2 percent after U.S. government data showed an increase in crude inventories and output, though stockpiles rose less than expected. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.20 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.35 percent. Cohn’s resignation became public on Tuesday, but he and Trump had been discussing his possible departure for weeks, a White House official said. “In the eyes of the market, (Cohn) was viewed as the adult in the room on many items,” said Gene Tannuzzo, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments in Minneapolis. “This should create a greater risk premium in the currency markets for countries that depend heavily on the U.S. for trade,” he said, noting the morning declines in the Mexican and Canadian currencies. Those two recovered early losses, with the Mexican peso turning higher against the dollar after the White House said the steel and aluminum tariffs could exclude both U.S. neighbors. Against the greenback, the Mexican peso gained 0.05 percent to 18.73 and the Canadian dollar fell 0.33 percent to 1.29 per U.S. dollar. However, the overall outlook for the U.S. currency was not upbeat. Goldman Sachs analysts said in a Wednesday note that tariffs similar to those proposed by Trump have usually been associated with subsequent currency weakness. “We therefore see the latest news as an additional reason to remain cautious on the outlook for the broad dollar,” according to Goldman’s note. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other major currencies, fell 0.02 percent, with the euro up 0.06 percent to $1.241. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.03 percent versus the greenback at 106.11 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3902, up 0.12 percent on the day. Steel sector stocks rose sharply on Wall Street, but not enough to keep the major U.S. indexes afloat on lingering concern that a protracted trade war would weaken the U.S. and global economies. Losses on the S&P 500 were as deep as 1 percent at one point, but have ebbed and flowed as traders look for clues on the future of trade policy in the day’s headlines. Equities got a bid after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who favors strong tariffs, said in a Bloomberg interview he was not a candidate to replace Cohn. “The market sees him (Navarro) as a very protectionist type. If he’s not in the running, the market seems to like that,” said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial in Utah, said that with Trump keeping a close eye on stock indexes, selling sparked by tariff and trade war talks could change the president’s mind. “Indeed, here is a president who judges his success by using the stock market as an important barometer for that. So if the market votes an overwhelming vote of no confidence on these tariffs, is there a chance that things change next week?” “I suspect that it’s still a fluid situation,” Ware said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 106.72 points, or 0.43 percent, to 24,777.4, the S&P 500 lost 5.46 points, or 0.20 percent, to 2,722.66 and the Nasdaq Composite added 14.36 points, or 0.19 percent, to 7,386.37. European car makers ended up 0.6 percent after dropping more than 1 percent on the risk of a hike in tariffs on exports to the United States. Emerging market stocks lost 0.45 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.56 percent lower, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.77 percent. Oil prices fell after U.S. government data showed an increase in inventories, with Washington’s plans for import tariffs weighing further on investor sentiment. U.S. crude fell 2.19 percent to $61.23 per barrel and Brent was last at $64.45, down 2.04 percent. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last fell 2/32 in price to yield 2.8827 percent, from 2.877 percent late on Tuesday. The 30-year bond last fell 10/32 in price to yield 3.1514 percent, from 3.136 percent late on Tuesday. Spot gold dropped 0.7 percent to $1,324.41 an ounce.

2018-03-07,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A delegation of workers from U.S. oil refining companies that oppose the nation’s biofuels policy converged on Washington on Wednesday to lobby lawmakers to find a way to lessen the regulation’s costs without hurting corn farmers and makers of the alternative fuels.  The trip, organized by the United Steelworkers union, marks the latest move in a battle between Big Oil and Big Corn over the fate of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard - a law requiring corn-based ethanol in gasoline that the refining industry says is costing it hundreds of millions of dollars a year. More than two dozen workers from refiners Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N), HollyFrontier Corp (HFC.N), PBF Energy Inc (PBF.N) and bankrupt Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) are expected to meet with lawmakers, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, to seek support for changes to the RFS. “We are going to try to explain how the RFS hurts merchant refiners and how there are options on the table to reform the program that don’t hurt the ethanol industry,” said Ryan O’Callaghan, president of the United Steelworkers chapter that represents PES. He said the group would urge changes that could lower costs of the RFS to refiners, including potentially placing a price cap on the blending credits at the center of the program, or by shifting the responsibility for blending fuels off of refiners and further down the supply chain. The workers were expected to finish with a roundtable-style meeting hosted by Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who has been the legislative face of the opposition in Washington. The meeting is closed to the press, the senator’s office said. Rural biofuel plant workers and managers delivered a letter to President Donald Trump on Wednesday, reminding him of their industry’s economic importance to the nation’s heartland. “After four straight years of declining agricultural income, your steadfast support of homegrown biofuels has been a lifeline for the farm economy,” the group wrote. “We ask that you send a clear and final signal that this administration will no longer entertain misleading schemes designed to kill the RFS.” The RFS currently requires refiners to cover the cost of blending increasing volumes of biofuels like ethanol into the nation’s fuel each year. To prove compliance, refiners must earn or purchase tradable blending credits, known as RINs - the price of which has skyrocketed in recent years. The program, established in 2007 to help farmers and cut petroleum imports, has been an economic driver in corn-states such as Iowa, but merchant refiners say the increasing compliance costs are overly burdensome and put jobs at risk.  PES, which employs more than 1,000 people in the key electoral state of Pennsylvania, in January blamed its bankruptcy on the costs of the credits. Reuters reported that other factors may also have played a role in its bankruptcy, including the withdrawal of more than $590 million in dividend-style payments from the company by its investor owners.  The company’s financial meltdown has heaped pressure on the White House and lawmakers to address biofuels policy. Last week, President Donald Trump waded deeper into the issue when he told rival groups gathered at the White House that he supported a compromise that temporarily caps credit prices to lower refinery costs, while also lifting restrictions on higher-ethanol blended gasoline to boost corn growers. The Environmental Protection Agency currently limits gasoline to 10 percent ethanol during the summer months, a policy intended to reduce ozone emissions and smog during the peak driving season.  Like past efforts to overhaul the RFS, Trump’s proposal faces political and legal challenges from ethanol industry advocates that worry a credit price cap would undermine the biofuels program.  Another White House meeting initially planned for this week to further discuss the idea may be postponed for logistical reasons, two sources said. In the meantime, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture are preparing an analysis of Trump’s proposals for the White House, the sources said.

2018-03-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May defended Britain’s links to security ally Saudi Arabia on Wednesday as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met Queen Elizabeth for lunch on a high-profile visit that drew protests over Riyadh’s human rights record. A fiery exchange in parliament between May and opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn underlined tension in Britain over Prince Mohammed’s trip, which was aimed at building a broader economic partnership between the two countries, but has sparked anger about alleged human rights abuses and the war in Yemen.  “The link that we have with Saudi Arabia is historic, it is an important one, and it has saved the lives of potentially hundreds of people in this country,” May said, pausing her answer briefly as opposition lawmakers cried “Shame!”. She was alluding to intelligence-sharing on Islamist militant suspects. The debate took place as Prince Mohammed lunched with the British monarch on the first leg of a trip packed with displays of diplomatic affection designed to help widen long-standing defence ties into a more far-reaching partnership. May later met Prince Mohammed at her Downing Street office, extending a warm diplomatic welcome to the conservative kingdom’s heir apparent and agreeing a 65 billion pound ($90.29 billion) trade and investment target. Britain is looking for trading partners as it exits the European Union, and energy powerhouse Saudi Arabia needs to convince sceptical investors about its domestic reforms.  “This is a significant boost for UK prosperity and a clear demonstration of the strong international confidence in our economy as we prepare to leave the European Union,” a spokeswoman from May’s office said after the meeting.  But demonstrators gathered outside May’s office amid a heavy police presence to protest at both countries’ role in Yemen, where war has killed around 10,000 people. A Saudi-led coalition intervened militarily in Yemen in 2015 and critics say Riyadh has been using British-supplied weapons in devastating strikes. “I don’t believe that someone like Mohammed bin Salman should be welcomed in Britain,” said Hassan Yassine, a 25-year-old customer service worker from London. “It is definitely not ethical, bearing in mind what is going on in Yemen every single day, every single second, even as we speak.” Corbyn said British military advisers were “directing the war” in Yemen. May’s spokesman said British personnel had no role in carrying out coalition air strikes, and were not involved in Saudi targeting decisions.  Police said a man was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage after an egg was thrown at a police vehicle as bin Salman’s motorcade arrived in Downing Street. Wednesday’s first official engagement was a trip to Buckingham Palace to see Queen Elizabeth - a rare honour usually reserved for heads of state. The Saudi delegation then met May at her offices to launch a UK-Saudi Strategic Partnership Council. The meeting set out the mutual trade and investment target, which would include direct investment in Britain and new Saudi public procurement with British companies. This would be spread across sectors including finance, education, healthcare, renewable energy and defence, May’s office said.  Britain is vying to land the stock market listing of state oil firm Saudi Aramco, but no decision is expected this week.  “We would like the Aramco share option to be issued in the United Kingdom and we will continue to suggest the City would be the best place for it,” junior foreign office minister Alistair Burt told parliament. Later this month Prince Mohammed visits the United States, which also wants the lucrative listing, although sources said both countries might miss out. British officials were privately delighted at the decision by Prince Mohammed, 32, to choose Britain as the major Western destination on his first foreign trip since becoming heir to the Saudi throne last year. The British government is keen to develop a two-way trade and investment relationship, eyeing both an expanded market in Saudi Arabia for service sector exports, and attracting Saudi cash to finance domestic projects. For his part, Saudi Arabia’s ambitious heir wants to show that “shock” reforms have made his country a better place to invest and a more tolerant society.  Photographs posted online showed London taxis displaying advertising graphics welcoming Prince Mohammed, and electronic billboards around the capital promoted pro-Saudi messages with the hashtag #anewsaudiarabia.  Business deals are possible with British defence group BAE Systems and European weapons maker MBDA, and initial agreements could be concluded on gas exploration, petrochemicals and other industries, according to British and Saudi sources.  The three-day visit will include a second Royal audience - dinner with the Prince Charles and Prince William on Wednesday - and a prestigious visit to May’s country residence on Thursday. The prime minister intends to use the private dinner at Chequers, a 16th-century manor house 40 miles (60 km) northwest of London, to further press her concerns over the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, her spokesman said. The Saudi-led coalition is fighting the Iran-allied Houthi movement in Yemen in a campaign to restore its internationally recognised government, generating what the United Nations said in January is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Demonstrators are protesting against Britain for licensing 4.6 billion pounds of weapons sales to Saudi Arabia since 2015. May said all arms sales were strictly regulated, that Saudi Arabia’s involvement in the conflict was backed by the U.N. Security Council and her government supported it. “The prime minister and crown prince agreed on the importance of full and unfettered humanitarian and commercial access, including through the ports, and that a political solution was ultimately the only way to end the conflict and humanitarian suffering in Yemen,” the statement from May’s office said.

2018-03-07,"WASHINGTON, March 7 (Reuters) - A Venezuelan state governor made an unusual visit to Washington this week seeking meetings with Congress members to discuss the fate of a Utah man imprisoned in the South American nation, U.S. sources said on Wednesday, as the country faces a possible new round of sanctions. Rafael Lacava, the governor of Venezuela’s Carabobo state, has requested meetings to discuss the imprisonment of Josh Holt, a Mormon missionary from Utah, and his wife, Thamara Caleno. The couple have been held since June 2016, when they were arrested on weapons charges shortly after Holt traveled to Venezuela to marry Caleno. “We are aware that he is here. There are suspicions that the Venezuela government is using the illegitimate detention of Mr. Holt as a bargaining chip to talk about U.S. sanctions,”  a U.S. official said. “We continue to call for the immediate and unconditional release of Mr. Holt and until he is released we continue to insist on regular ongoing consular contacts with him as called for under international law,” the official said. It is unusual for an official from Venezuela to visit Washington for such meetings. Washington and Caracas are international adversaries, with disagreements on a wide range of issues. President Donald Trump’s administration is considering new sanctions targeting the country’s oil sector to increase pressure on socialist President Nicolas Maduro as he runs for another term in an election Washington and its allies consider a sham. Another U.S. source familiar with the situation confirmed that Lacava was in Washington to discuss Holt’s situation, but did not believe that sanctions relief would be discussed in meetings with members of Congress since lawmakers would defer to the Trump administration on any such matter. “While I am not able to speculate on what else might be on Mr. Lacava’s agenda, I want to make very clear that the sole purpose of such meetings would be to encourage the release of Mr. Holt and his wife,” the source said. “There would be no negotiation, and any claim to the contrary is simply false,” the source said. Lawmakers, led by Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, have been advocating for Holt’s immediate release. A Hatch spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lacava’s visit.

2018-03-07,"TIRANA, March 7 (Reuters) - Albania’s electricity imports soared last year as output by state-owned and private hydropower plants fell 37 percent due to a lack of rain, data showed on Wednesday. Since the fall of communism in 1990, demand for power in Albania has risen by more than 10 percent a year on average and the country has been a net importer except for in 2016, when it briefly became a net exporter. The Institute of Statistics said the net power produced in 2017 was 4,525 GWh, down 36.6 percent from 7,136 GWh in 2016. To fill the gap, the country imported 3,403 GWh of electricity, up 86.3 percent from 1,827 GWh in 2016. Its exports shrank 73.9 percent to 488 GWh in 2017 from 1,869 in 2016. Power production relies wholly on rainwater. Almost all of the electricity in Albania is produced by its three big communist-era hydropower stations and new private ones built after 2006 when the country faced long blackouts and the government launched a drive to add new sources of energy. Network losses of electricity, a term which covers both technical losses and theft, were down 5.5 percent in 2017, the institute said.

2018-03-07,"(Updates prices, changes comments, dateline from previous LONDON) * U.S. data drags crude prices lower * U.S. stocks off their lows; Europe edges up * Steel stocks rally on Wall Street By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters) - A key gauge of world stock markets slipped on Wednesday after a strong advocate of free trade resigned from the White House, fanning fears that U.S. President Donald Trump will proceed with protectionist tariffs and risk a global trade war. But the U.S. dollar recovered most of its overnight losses as some investors wagered that even with the departure of Trump’s chief economic adviser Gary Cohn, the president’s hard talk could still be a tactic amid ongoing trade negotiations with Canada and Mexico. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.52 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.33 percent. Cohn had resigned on Tuesday, but he and the president had been discussing his possible departure for weeks, a White House official said. “In the eyes of the market, (Cohn) was viewed as the adult in the room on many items,” said Gene Tannuzzo, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments in Minneapolis. “This should create a greater risk premium in the currency markets for countries that depend heavily on the U.S. for trade. Not surprisingly, the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso are much weaker this morning.” Against the greenback, the Mexican peso lost 0.36 percent to 18.81 and the Canadian dollar fell 0.90 percent to 1.30 per dollar. However, the overall outlook for the U.S. currency is not upbeat. Goldman Sachs analysts said in a Wednesday note that tariffs similar to those proposed by Trump have usually been associated with subsequent currency weakness. “We therefore see the latest news as an additional reason to remain cautious on the outlook for the broad Dollar,” according to Goldman’s note. The dollar index, tracking it against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.1 percent, with the euro down 0.06 percent to $1.2395. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.18 percent versus the greenback at 105.96 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3887, up 0.01 percent on the day. Steel sector stocks rose sharply on Wall Street, but not enough to keep the major U.S. indexes afloat on lingering concern that a protracted trade war would weaken the U.S. and global economies. The losses, however, were smaller than what futures had indicated overnight in an initial reaction to Cohn’s exit. “I suspect that it’s still a fluid situation,” said Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial in Utah. He said with Trump keeping a close eye on stock indexes, the selling that is preceded by tariff and trade war talks could change the president’s mind. “Indeed, here is a president who judges his success by using the stock market as an important barometer for that. So if the market votes an overwhelming vote of no confidence on these tariffs, is there a chance that things change next week? Could be.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 276.91 points, or 1.11 percent, to 24,607.21, the S&P 500 lost 19.67 points, or 0.72 percent, to 2,708.45 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 34.90 points, or 0.47 percent, to 7,337.10. Equities got a bid after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who favors strong tariffs, said in a Bloomberg interview he was not a candidate to replace Cohn. “The market’s gone up on that,” said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. “The market sees him (Navarro) as a very protectionist type. If he’s not in the running, the market seems to like that.” European car makers, were up 0.6 percent after earlier dropping more than 1 percent on the risk of a hike in import tariffs to the United States. Emerging market stocks lost 0.64 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.74 percent lower, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.77 percent. Oil prices fell after U.S. government data showed an increase in inventories, with Washington’s plans for import tariffs weighing further on investor sentiment. U.S. crude fell 2.41 percent to $61.09 per barrel and Brent was last at $64.32, down 2.23 percent on the day. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 5/32 in price to yield 2.8607 percent, from 2.877 percent late on Tuesday. The 30-year bond last rose 1/32 in price to yield 3.1349 percent, from 3.136 percent late on Tuesday. Spot gold dropped 0.7 percent to $1,324.47 an ounce.

2018-03-07,"(Adds Serbian grid operator comment in para 12) By Fatos Bytyci and Maja Zuvela SARAJEVO, March 7 (Reuters) - European power grid lobby ENTSO-E urged Serbia and Kosovo to urgently resolve a dispute over their power grid, which has affected the broader European network, causing some digital clocks on the continent to lose time. The grid shared by Serbia and its former province Kosovo is connected to Europe’s synchronized high voltage power network. ENTSO-E, which represents European electricity transmission operators, said the continental network had lost 113 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of energy since mid-January because Kosovo had been using more electricity than it generates. Serbia, which is responsible for balancing Kosovo’s grid, had failed to do so, ENTSO-E said. The loss of energy had meant that electric clocks that are steered by the frequency of the power system, rather than by a quartz crystal, to lag nearly six minutes behind, ENTSO-E said. Many digital clocks, such as those in alarm clocks and in ovens or microwaves, use the frequency of the power grid to keep time. The problem emerges when the frequency drops over a sustained period of time. ENTSO-E said the European network’s frequency had deviated from its standard of 50 Hertz (Hz) to 49.996 Hz since mid-January, resulting in 113 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of lost energy, although it had appeared to be returning to normal on Tuesday. “Deviation stopped yesterday after Kosovo took some steps but it will take some time to get the system back to normal,” ENTSO-E spokeswoman Susanne Nies told Reuters. She said the risk could remain if there is no political solution to the problem. The political dispute centres mainly on regulatory issues and a row between Serbia and Kosovo over grid operation. It is further complicated by the fact that Belgrade still does not recognise Kosovo. “We will try to fix the technicalities by the end of this week but the question of who will compensate for this loss has to be answered,” Nies said. ENTSO-E urged European governments and policymakers to take swift action and exert pressure on Kosovo and Serbia to resolve the issue, which is also hampering integration of the western Balkans energy market required by the European Union. “These actions need to address the political side of this issue,” ENTSO-E said in a statement. Serbian grid operator EMS said in a statement that it has committed all its resources to resolving this issue “in a swift and efficient manner”. Kosovo’s grid operator, KOSTT, could not be reached for comment. Kosovo seceded from Serbia in 2008. Both states want to join the European Union but Brussels says they must normalize relations to forge closer ties with the bloc. Serbia and Kosovo signed an agreement on operating their power grid in 2015. However, it has not been implemented yet as they cannot agree on power distribution in Kosovo amid conflicting claims about ownership of the grid, built when they were both part of Yugoslavia.

2018-03-07,"(Reuters) - Oil and gas producer Energen Corp said on Wednesday it has settled a long-simmering fight with activist investor Keith Meister by agreeing to review its businesses and appoint two board members in the wake of pressure to sell the company. Birmingham, Alabama-based Energen, which has operations in the Permian Basin, said it is expanding its board to 11 people and invited energy industry entrepreneur Jonathan Cohen and investor Vincent Intrieri, a longtime associate of billionaire investor Carl Icahn who has sat on numerous boards, to join. Both men will stand for election at Energen’s 2018 annual meeting, as required by Alabama law. At the meeting, Meister’s Corvex Management, a hedge fund that owns a roughly 10 percent stake in Energen, will support the company’s slate, the oil and gas firm said in a statement. Activism in the U.S. oil and gas sector has increased as investors seek to boost the value of energy companies weighed down by slumping crude prices after a mid-2014 peak. New York-based Corvex has spent nearly a year pushing for a sale, hoping to boost Energen’s share price, which has lagged its peers. In the last 52 weeks Energen’s share price has climbed 5.3 percent and was up 0.3 percent to $55.89 in Wednesday trade.  In January Corvex stepped up its pressure by nominating four candidates to Energen’s board, including Cohen, the founder of Atlas Energy and Atlas Pipeline Partners, and Intrieri. Cohen’s companies were respectively sold to Chevron Corp in 2011 and Targa Resources Corp in 2015. Intrieri worked for years for Icahn. Meister also worked for Icahn before launching his own fund. Energen Chief Executive Officer James McManus and Meister said in a statement that they have worked constructively and are pleased to have resolved the fight. Over the last months Meister has criticized the company for making decisions in a vacuum without properly consulting shareholders. Energen complained the hedge fund was pushing for a sale without regard to price or improvements it was making. As part of their settlement, Energen will consider a possible sale. It will “conduct an in-depth review, assisted by financial advisers, of the company’s business plan, competitive positioning and potential strategic alternatives,” it said in the statement. Nine months ago the company ended an earlier review by announcing it was sticking to its business plan after J.P. Morgan and Tudor Pickering Holt & Co looked into strategic alternatives.

Gary Cohn, the president’s top economic adviser and a free trade advocate, resigned on Tuesday in a sign of an internal clash on the issue within the administration.

2018-03-07,"PARIS (Reuters) - Rising biodiesel imports from Argentina and an expected surge in shipments from Indonesia threaten to cripple output in the European Union, the world’s top producer of the renewable fuel. The European Union slashed import duties on Argentine biodiesel last September after Buenos Aires mounted a successful challenge at the World Trade Organisation, weeks after the United States imposed steep duties on the fuel. The bloc is now considering whether to cut duties on Indonesian biodiesel. Argentine soybean-based fuel is now entering the EU at much lower prices than rapeseed oil, the main material used by European producers, who say they cannot compete and in some cases are being pushed to the verge of bankruptcy. Between August last year and January, 852,000 tonnes of biodiesel - around four times the capacity of a large EU plant - worth $617 million, were exported from Argentina to the bloc, customs data showed. Earlier in 2017, nearly all exports were heading to the United States. Raffaello Garofalo, head of the European Biodiesel Board (EBB), said the impact of Argentine imports was already worse than expected. “There is huge economic damage and we risk seeing many European renewable fuel producers close down in the face of these unfair import floods,” he said. The EU is the world’s largest producer and consumer of biodiesel, a fuel made mostly from vegetable oils, which is renewable and aimed at reducing carbon emissions. EU production of biodiesel was 11.9 million tonnes in 2017, up from 11.7 million a year earlier. But consultancy Strategie Grains, which initially said output would be stable this year, has cut its 2018 estimate to 11.6 million tonnes because of the Argentine imports. Imports of Argentine biodiesel into the EU could hit 1.5 million tonnes in 2018, with a similar volume from Indonesia if the EU cuts its duties, Strategie Grains said. The rise in imports comes as several producers in the European Union are being pressed hard by internal competition and low margins. The EU’s top producer, Saipol, part of oilseed group Avril, said it would cut production by nearly half this year, with around 250 out of 600 staff working reduced hours, mainly because of imports of Argentine biodiesel. “There is a double impact, on our sales but also on the biodiesel market, where prices are weighed down by the arrival of cheap products,” Kristell Guizouarn, head of France’s biodiesel industry group Esterifrance, said. Both Argentina and Indonesia impose a higher export duty on the raw material - soybeans and palm oil respectively - than on biodiesel. This allows biodiesel producers in the two countries to “dump” products abroad at unfairly low prices, EU producers say. Since September, European rapeseed oil-based biodiesel prices have fallen 12 percent but are still about 25 percent higher than Argentine soybean oil-based biodiesel delivered to the bloc. <0#BIODIESEL=HBI>  The EU was Argentina’s largest biodiesel market until the tariffs were implemented in 2013. The Spanish biodiesel industry could be hard hit. There would be no need to produce the fuel in Spain if cheap biodiesel is available from Argentina, said Christophe Cogny, analyst at Strategie Grains, adding that Spanish companies were already facing severe overcapacity. Germany, the EU’s largest producing country, warned of a massive fall in output this year due to what it called unfairly subsidized imports. “Immediate measures should be taken by the EU to restrain the imports in order to prevent this threat to the very existence of the German biodiesel industry,” Elmar Baumann, head of the German Biofuels Industry Association VDB, said. COUNTER-MEASURES The EU opened an anti-subsidy investigation into Argentine biodiesel at the end of January, after a complaint by the EBB, potentially offering a way to impose duties on imported biodiesel. Argentine producers accused the EU of protectionism. “We are confident that we have a very clear and strong case to defend ourselves,” said Luis Zubizarreta, president of Carbio, Argentina’s biofuels industry chamber. If the investigation finds that Argentina benefited from unfair subsidies, provisional duties could be imposed late this year. The scope of such duties is unknown.  In the meantime, pressured by the industry, France adopted stricter environmental rules for imported biofuels, a measure  intended to restrict inflows from Argentina. But since most shipments enter the EU via the Netherlands or Spain and are then distributed internally, it will be hard to track the impact of the French action. The United States imposed steep duties on Argentine and Indonesian biodiesel last August, saying the fuel was unfairly subsidized.

2018-03-07,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Britain’s biggest carmakers such as Jaguar Land Rover (TAMO.NS) cautioned Prime Minister Theresa May that their plants would become more expensive and complicated to run if Brexit creates barriers to trade. Ahead of Britain’s exit, the world’s biggest car companies are grappling with how they will import millions of components from around the world and then export cars made at British factories to European clients after a Brexit transition ends. Carmakers already have plans on how to handle multiple scenarios including delays at ports which would hit a global business model reliant on the swift movement of components, engines and finished models across borders, executives said.  “It costs us two-digit million number of pounds which is absolutely wasted if the one or the other condition is going to happen but at the end of the day we cannot risk the company,” Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) Chief Executive Ralf Speth told Reuters at the Geneva Motor Show.  “We are talking about minutes at the borders and if we are out of the minutes, we have huge disadvantages in terms of inventory, logistics and therefore we have to do all this kind of contingency planning now,” said Speth, who heads Britain’s biggest car company.  He warned that any divergence in vehicle standards between Britain and the European Union, which are currently the same, would be a “fallback to the Middle Ages.”  While London and Brussels hope to agree a transition deal at an EU summit this month that will maintain the status quo until the end of 2020, companies are already trying to plan for an uncertain long-term future in Britain.  At stake is the future of one of Britain’s few manufacturing success stories since the 1980s: a car industry employing over 800,000 people and generating turnover of 77.5 billion pounds  ($110 billion). BMW and other companies will meet May and her finance minister, Philip Hammond, on Thursday to discuss Brexit, as the government seeks to assure them it will protect frictionless trade despite being outside the EU’s tariff-free customs union. The meeting comes as U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to raise tariffs on foreign cars would hit British firms which import all their models sold to U.S. buyers, raising questions about May’s aim to strike a trade deal with the United States. On Brexit, Honda and Peugeot are also among those considering extra warehousing to hold larger stocks of components to protect their “just-in-time” production from any customs checks which could introduce delays after Brexit. Honda’s European Government affairs manager, who told lawmakers last year the Japanese carmaker would need to trigger its contingency plans this month, told Reuters the firm was awaiting further detail. “We are monitoring the situation as the negotiations unfold and look forward to receiving additional clarity at the March council,” said Patrick Keating.  BMW’s Mini said the complications of preparing for a loss of unfettered trade were huge. “We don’t know if each truck gets held up. We can build up bigger stocks so that we are more flexible in production. It is a nightmare right now,” said board member Peter Schwarzenbauer. The EU offered Britain on Wednesday a post-Brexit free-trade agreement that is modest compared with what London has called for. The 27 remaining EU members said the agreement would aim to cover trade in all goods sectors “which should be subject to zero tariffs and no quantitative restrictions.” Boosting supplies and dealing with any new customs checks would allow British plants to keep operating, but such measures could make them less competitive against European rivals, making it harder to attract new models in future. And while Nissan, Toyota and BMW have all announced new investment in Britain since the Brexit referendum in June 2016, Ford, Jaguar Land Rover and Peugeot warned at the Geneva Motor Show that they needed certainty to make upcoming choices. “The sooner we have the clarity, the easier the decisions become to make, positive or negative,” Ford’s Europe boss Steven Armstrong told Reuters on Monday.  Britain’s car industry has been one of the most vocal in pushing to maintain the current access it enjoys with its biggest export market with investment slumping a third to 1.1 billion pounds ($1.55 billion) last year as many await clarity. Peugeot could decide as soon as this year whether to keep its Vauxhall Ellesmere Port plant open whilst JLR is considering whether to build electric cars in its home market.  Although many executives believe a transitional deal will be agreed, there are still question marks over the future of some aspects such as whether licenses granted by Britain’s Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA) will remain valid across the EU. Aston Martin’s boss Andy Palmer said the quintessentially British firm, famed for being James Bond’s car of choice, had ditched the VCA in favor of Spain’s vehicle body for the time being, including for its next car, the next-generation Vanquish. “When they tell us that they have no confidence that they’ll be able to test against European emissions, then as businesses you can wait and wait or you can delay and you can delay or eventually you have to decide,” Palmer told Reuters.

2018-03-07,"(Adds Nigerian response) LAGOS, March 7 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday that Nigeria was slowly exiting recession but remains vulnerable because its growth is tied to oil prices and improved revenues are restricted to the energy and agriculture sectors. The assessment, published in a report on Wednesday, came in the IMF’s Article IV consultation, an annual appraisal of a country’s economy. Reuters reported on the lender’s findings last week after seeing a copy of the document, which states that the fund expects Nigeria’s government to “muddle through” in the medium term. Nigeria emerged in the second quarter of 2017 from its first recession in 25 years, largely caused by low crude prices and militant attacks on energy facilities. Higher oil prices and an end to the attacks mostly account for the end of the recession. Crude oil sales make up around two-thirds of government revenue and the majority of foreign exchange. “The Nigerian economy is slowly exiting recession but remains vulnerable,” the IMF said in its report. It said the economy had been helped by higher oil prices, improved access to foreign exchange and foreign reserves rising to a four-year high. But the improvements have not yet boosted non-oil, non-agricultural activity, it said. “Lower oil prices, tighter external market conditions, heightened security issues, and delayed policy responses are the main downside risks,” it said. In the IMF’s summary of the government’s response to the report, unidentified Nigerian authorities wished “to register their displeasure with the phrase ‘muddle through’ ... and failure to appreciate government efforts despite several initiatives to strengthen the fiscal situation and promote growth.” The government also complained that the IMF had highlighted Nigeria’s endemic corruption. “They find the reference to ‘pervasive/widespread corruption’ in Nigeria inappropriate, given that corruption is relative across the globe,” the IMF said. “Going forward, the (Nigerian) authorities request staff to correct the errors and use proper phrases to reflect actual situations.” The Fund’s report also repeated its calls for Nigeria to lift its remaining foreign exchange restrictions and scrap its system of multiple exchange rates. The IMF has for more than a year called for Nigeria to simplify its complex foreign exchange system, used to reduce the impact of dollar shortages, which has left large gaps between official rates and various windows that certain groups can use for access to other rates. The report said the Fund recommends “removing multiple currency practices and unifying the exchange rate as quickly as possible”. It said the move would increase confidence, remove market distortions and increase transparency. Nigeria’s gross domestic product grew 0.83 percent in 2017 after shrinking 1.58 percent in 2016, which was its first annual contraction in 25 years. “Under the baseline scenario, growth would pick up to 2.1 percent in 2018, from 0.8 percent in 2017, helped by the full year impact of greater FX availability and recovering oil production,” the Fund said in the report. The Fund’s 2018 growth projection is unchanged from an estimate announced by the lender in December.

2018-03-07,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced pre-election  handouts to millions of families and pensioners on Wednesday after his right-wing Fidesz party suffered a surprise by-election defeat ahead of an April 8 national poll. Fidesz is well ahead of rivals in opinion polls for the national election, but was caught off guard by the victory of an opposition-backed independent over its candidate in a by-election on Feb. 25. Seeking a third consecutive term, Fidesz is campaigning with a fiercely anti-immigrant message and promises of more state spending, including on wages and pensions. In a video clip posted on his Facebook page, Orban said the country’s around 2.6 million pensioners would receive a one-off voucher for food purchases and that every Hungarian family would get a refund of 12,000 forints ($48) on its heating bill. “In the past weeks we have suffered from extreme cold weather in Hungary, the gas consumption of families has increased and so did the gas bill... Therefore, we decided on a winter reduction of gas bills,” Orban said. It was not immediately clear whether the refund would be financed from the state budget or by gas firms. Most gas distribution companies are owned by the state after Orban’s government took over much of the energy sector from foreign firms over the past eight years. Hungary’s national weather institute has said this winter has been milder than usual and that January was the sixth warmest since 1901. The Economy Ministry was not immediately available to comment on the cost of the new measures. Reuters’ calculations showed the two measures could cost a total of over 60 billion forints (171.9 million pounds), but Peter Virovacz, an analyst at ING Bank, said this posed no risk to the budget deficit target. “This can be covered from the reserves,” he said. “We can regard this as a gesture ahead of elections.” Hungarian governments of various hues have often offered generous welfare handouts to voters ahead of elections since the fall of communism in 1989. Orban said last week that opposition parties would unite to try to oust his party in the national election and would turn Hungary into a haven for immigrants.

2018-03-07,"(Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N), which was the most valuable publicly traded U.S. industrial conglomerate at the beginning of the year, could sink to the No. 4 spot after a prolonged selloff that has shaken confidence in the company. Valued at close to $580 billion at the turn of the millennium, GE has dropped to around $125 billion and it was surpassed in value by 3M Co (MMM.N) in January for the first time since the 1970s. At one point last week, the gap between GE and fellow U.S. industrial Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) was $6 billion, or 5 percent. The difference between GE and United Tech Corp’s (UTX.N) market values fell to $15 billion. (GRAPHIC: GE Market value - reut.rs/2D6JFB5) Helping to narrow the gap is a 45 percent slide in GE stock over 2017 and a 16 percent fall this year. Driven in value by a series of investments in several sectors during the 1990s, GE is now paying the price for focusing outside its traditional industrial manufacturing turf, while its rivals have enjoyed a more steady ascent thanks to a sharper focus on their industrial roots. “All the large-cap diversified industrials like Honeywell, United Technologies and 3M to name a few, have benefited from some of the money that’s come out of GE,” said JPMorgan analyst Steve Tusa, who has a five-star rating on Thomson Reuters Eikon for recommendation performance. “You’re really talking about maybe a mid-teens stock at 2020 ... $20 I think is a very long-term target that really isn’t in the equation at this point,” Tusa said of GE’s shares, which closed at $14.64 on Monday. Tusa rates GE’s stock “underweight” with a price target of $14. But some analysts are optimistic about GE’s stock and future prospects. William Blair & Co analyst Nicholas Heymann believes that the worse could be over for GE, and its shares are likely to begin stabilizing before moving higher as 2018 progresses. “I think GE shares have been a bit oversold due to excessive fears about liquidity,” Heymann wrote in a note. Heymann cites higher oil prices, improving performance of GE’s aviation and healthcare businesses, and the recent nomination of three “exceptionally talented” directors to GE’s board. He has an “outperform” rating on the stock.  GE shares slid even after the company replaced Jeff Immelt as CEO last August with John Flannery. His turnaround plan, which includes cutting jobs, slashing GE’s dividend and a possible break-up of the conglomerate, is likely to take a year or more to show results. When Immelt took over in September 2001, GE was the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company. But during his tenure, which ended July 2017, the stock price fell about 40 percent. Over Jack Welch’s stint as CEO from 1981 to 2001, GE’s value rose from $13 billion to several hundred billions of dollars. Welch has since written or co-written bestselling books on management. (GRAPHIC: GE share performance under three different CEOs - reut.rs/2Fh6rfu) GE’s stock trades at roughly 14 times its forecasted earnings, well below the multiples of its peers, as the graphic below shows. The number helps investors gauge the value of a company relative to its earnings. Saint Paul, Minnesota-based 3M, best known for its Post-it notes and Scotch tape, saw its stock rise nearly 32 percent last year thanks to strong results that helped the company lift its yearly earnings forecast three times. Honeywell’s stock also rose around 32 percent in 2017, as the company sold more aircraft parts and as its energy customers bought more industrial equipment. Its warehouse automation equipment and software benefited from an ecommerce boom. (GRAPHIC: GE Forward Earnings - reut.rs/2FlZtGg) “We like Honeywell, given a solid management team and exposure to end markets we favor,” said Richard Grasfeder, a portfolio manager at Boston Private Wealth LLC, which holds about 787,600 shares in GE as of the end of 2017. United Tech, which sells the Pratt & Whitney jet engines, has a “significant long-term advantage” over GE, Grasfeder said. “We think United Tech could provide learning points for GE management and investors,” Grasfeder said. “Good leadership is critical.” Reporting by Sai Sachin Ravikumar and Ankit Ajmera; Additional reporting by Ankur Banerjee; Editing by Patrick Graham, Bernard Orr",https://uk.reuters.com/article/ge-stocks/graphic-ge-value-could-slip-to-lowest-among-large-u-s-industrials-idUKL8N1QH6XO,07 Mar 2018,"General Electric Co, which was

2018-03-07,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - French energy group Engie (ENGIE.PA) is considering selling its power plant assets in Germany in a deal that could fetch a few hundred million euros, two people familiar with the process told Reuters. Engie owns or holds stakes in three hard coal-fired power plants in Germany. It is the sole owner of the 472 megawatt (MW) Zolling site near Munich and the 351 MW Farge plant, and has a 52 percent stake in the 731 MW site in Wilhelmshaven. One of the people said Engie had hired JP Morgan (JPM.N) to advise on selling the assets, which could also include its local retail business. The source said the sale could also cover Engie’s 800 MW Centrale Rotterdam plant in the Netherlands. Engie’s Wilhelmshaven plant in Germany is one of the most modern in Europe, with an efficiency level of 46 percent. Switzerland’s BKW Energie AG (BKWB.S) has a 33 percent stake and municipal utility WSW Energie & Wasser AG owns 15 percent. In addition to coal-fired capacity, Engie’s Zolling plant has two 25 MW gas turbines that can be switched on in times of high demand or undersupply to balance out demand swings. Engie also operates a 20 MW biomass plant there. Possible buyers for the assets could include Czech energy group EPH and German utility RWE (RWEG.DE), which have both snapped up conventional power plants in the past or have announced plans to do so, the people said. Engie, EPH, JP Morgan and RWE all declined to comment. Engie, Europe’s fourth-largest utility by market value, has long been reducing exposure to coal, reinvesting proceeds from sales of fossil-fuel assets in renewables and grids as the sector shifts away from conventional power source. Sources said this week the group was looking at big acquisitions that would generate cash, in a strategy switch following the sale of 15 billion euros ($18.6 billion) of assets that have shrunk its earnings base.

The source told Reuters the initial public offering (IPO) was aimed mainly at providing an exit for private equity group Omnes Capital, which has two funds with a combined 24 percent stake in Neoen. “Omnes is at the end of its holding period, the IPO will give it the opportunity to exit,” the source said, adding that Neoen has little need for external cash as its current shareholders are funding its capital needs. Omnes Capital could not immediately be reached for comment. Neoen was founded by Jacques Veyrat, the former chief executive of commodities giant Louis Dreyfus, who still owns a 56 stake in Neoen through his investment vehicle Impala and who will hang on to its majority stake in the IPO. State investment fund Bpifrance owns 14 percent of Neoen. The source said it was too early to comment on a precise value for the company so far ahead of the operation but that one billion euros would be a reasonable figure. “Let’s say that Jacques Veyrat has a good track record at raising unicorns,” he said. The source said Neoen had appointed Natixis and JPMorgan as lead banks for the share sale, with Societe Generale and Barclays in a supporting role. The source said Neoen, which has invested one billion euros in renewable energy assets since its foundation in 2008, is growing quickly in France, Australia and Latin America, notably in Mexico and Argentina. The company has 1,525 megawatts of renewable energy generating capacity installed or under construction and is aiming for capacity of 3,000 to 4,000 MW by 2020. It is one of several start-up French renewable energy companies that are competing with market leaders EDF and Engie. It stole a march on its big competitors in 2015 by opening a 300 MW solar farm, then Europe’s biggest, near Bordeaux. Neoen chief executive Xavier Barbaro told Reuters in Sept. 2016 the firm was considering an IPO before the end of the decade in order to fund its rapid growth. Several promising French renewable energy firms have been bought by French utilities recently, including solar firm Solairedirect, acquired by Engie for 430 million euros in 2016, and Quadran, bought by Direct Energie last year.

At stake is the future of one of Britain’s few manufacturing success stories since the 1980s: a car industry employing over 800,000 people and generating turnover of 77.5 billion pounds. BMW and other companies will meet May and her finance minister, Philip Hammond, on Thursday to discuss Brexit, as the government seeks to assure them it will protect frictionless trade despite being outside the EU’s tariff-free customs union. The meeting comes as U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to raise tariffs on foreign cars would hit British firms which import all their models sold to U.S. buyers, raising questions about May’s aim to strike a trade deal with the United States. On Brexit, Honda and Peugeot are also among those considering extra warehousing to hold larger stocks of components to protect their “just-in-time” production from any customs checks which could introduce delays after Brexit. Honda’s European Government affairs manager, who told lawmakers last year the Japanese carmaker would need to trigger its contingency plans this month, told Reuters the firm was awaiting further detail. “We are monitoring the situation as the negotiations unfold and look forward to receiving additional clarity at the March council,” said Patrick Keating.  BMW’s Mini said the complications of preparing for a loss of unfettered trade were huge. “We don’t know if each truck gets held up. We can build up bigger stocks so that we are more flexible in production. It is a nightmare right now,” said board member Peter Schwarzenbauer. The EU offered Britain on Wednesday a post-Brexit free-trade agreement that is modest compared with what London has called for. The 27 remaining EU members said the agreement would aim to cover trade in all goods sectors “which should be subject to zero tariffs and no quantitative restrictions.” Boosting supplies and dealing with any new customs checks would allow British plants to keep operating, but such measures could make them less competitive against European rivals, making it harder to attract new models in future. And while Nissan, Toyota and BMW have all announced new investment in Britain since the Brexit referendum in June 2016, Ford, Jaguar Land Rover and Peugeot warned at the Geneva Motor Show that they needed certainty to make upcoming choices. “The sooner we have the clarity, the easier the decisions become to make, positive or negative,” Ford’s Europe boss Steven Armstrong told Reuters on Monday.  Britain’s car industry has been one of the most vocal in pushing to maintain the current access it enjoys with its biggest export market with investment slumping a third to 1.1 billion pounds last year as many await clarity. Peugeot could decide as soon as this year whether to keep its Vauxhall Ellesmere Port plant open whilst JLR is considering whether to build electric cars in its home market.  Although many executives believe a transitional deal will be agreed, there are still question marks over the future of some aspects such as whether licences granted by Britain’s Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA) will remain valid across the EU. Aston Martin’s boss Andy Palmer said the quintessentially British firm, famed for being James Bond’s car of choice, had ditched the VCA in favour of Spain’s vehicle body for the time being, including for its next car, the next-generation Vanquish. “When they tell us that they have no confidence that they’ll be able to test against European emissions, then as businesses you can wait and wait or you can delay and you can delay or eventually you have to decide,” Palmer told Reuters.

2018-03-07,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Britain’s biggest carmakers such as Jaguar Land Rover cautioned Prime Minister Theresa May that their plants would become more expensive and complicated to run if Brexit creates barriers to trade. Ahead of Britain’s exit, the world’s biggest car companies are grappling with how they will import millions of components from around the world and then export cars made at British factories to European clients after a Brexit transition ends. Carmakers already have plans on how to handle multiple scenarios including delays at ports which would hit a global business model reliant on the swift movement of components, engines and finished models across borders, executives said.  “It costs us two-digit million number of pounds which is absolutely wasted if the one or the other condition is going to happen but at the end of the day we cannot risk the company,” Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) Chief Executive Ralf Speth told Reuters at the Geneva Motor Show.  “We are talking about minutes at the borders and if we are out of the minutes, we have huge disadvantages in terms of inventory, logistics and therefore we have to do all this kind of contingency planning now,” said Speth, who heads Britain’s biggest car company.  He warned that any divergence in vehicle standards between Britain and the European Union, which are currently the same, would be a “fallback to the Middle Ages.”  While London and Brussels hope to agree a transition deal at an EU summit this month that will maintain the status quo until the end of 2020, companies are already trying to plan for an uncertain long-term future in Britain.

2018-03-07,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece could sell up to a 51 percent stake in its biggest oil refiner Hellenic Petroleum (HEPr.AT) to meet a key condition of its international bailout, government and union officials said. Under its latest 86 billion euro ($107 billion) bailout, Athens agreed to launch a series of privatizations this year, including divesting the state’s 35.5 percent stake in Hellenic or selling a smaller stake if its lenders agreed. Now, however, Athens is looking at selling all or part of its stake together with part of Paneuropean Oil and Industrial Holdings’ stake for a combined 51 percent stake. That is one of two options under consideration, but the most likely, an energy ministry official who declined to be named told Reuters on Wednesday. Paneuropean Oil, which is Hellenic’s biggest shareholder with a 45.5 percent stake, is owned by Greece’s Latsis Group.  The other option being considered is a convertible bond issue by Hellenic Petroleum, the official said, adding that whatever the government decides, it aimed to have it wrapped up by this summer. Paneuropean Oil declined to comment on the options but said it was up to the government to decide how it wanted to proceed. The head of Hellenic’s main labor union, which strongly opposes the planned sale, told Reuters that Energy Minister George Stathakis outlined the options during a meeting with the union last week.  The 51 percent stake sale was presented as the most likely  scenario, Yiorgos Skopelitis told Reuters on Wednesday. Under the bailout, which expires in August, Athens must launch the sale this month and has earmarked 500 million euros in proceeds in this year’s budget plan. Greece aims at total proceeds of 2 billion euros from stake sales in 2018.  Hellenic Petroleum, with a market value of 2.4 billion euros, operates three refineries in Greece. It holds an exploration license in the Patraikos Gulf off the Peloponnese peninsula and plans to start test drilling there in 2019.

2018-03-07,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has  described Turkey as part of a “triangle of evil” along with Iran and hardline Islamist groups, Egypt’s Al-Shorouk newspaper reported on Wednesday. The Saudi prince also accused Turkey of trying to reinstate the Islamic Caliphate, abolished nearly a century ago when the Ottoman Empire collapsed. His reported comments reflect Saudi Arabia’s deep suspicion of President Tayyip Erdogan, whose ruling AK Party has its roots in Islamist politics and who has allied his country with Qatar in its dispute with Saudi Arabia and some other Gulf states. Turkey has also worked with Iran, Saudi Arabia’s arch-rival in the Middle East, to try to reduce fighting in northern Syria in recent months, and Iranian and Turkish military chiefs exchanged visits last year. Al-Shorouk quoted Prince Mohammed as saying “the contemporary triangle of evil comprises Iran, Turkey and extremist religious groups.” The prince spoke to Egyptian newspaper editors during a visit to Cairo, on his first foreign trip since becoming heir to the oil exporting giant last year. He said the dispute with Qatar could be long-lasting, comparing it to the U.S. embargo of Cuba imposed 60 years ago, but played down its impact, dismissing the Gulf emirate as “smaller than a Cairo street”. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic and trade links with Qatar last June, suspending air and shipping routes with the world’s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, which is home to the region’s biggest U.S. military base. However, Prince Salman said Qatar would not be barred from attending an Arab summit hosted by Saudi Arabia later this month.

It was not immediately clear whether the heating subsidy would be paid from the budget or by gas firms. The announcement by Orban, who faces an election on April 8, comes a day after the 54-year-old prime minister committed to keeping the budget deficit within the European Union’s 3 percent of economic output limit in the 2018 election year.

2018-03-07,"KASSEL, Germany (Reuters) - BASF’s oil and gas subsidiary Wintershall announced plans on Wednesday to expand into Brazil’s growing offshore oil sector as part of a drive to boost sales and profit this year. Chief executive Mario Mehren told reporters his company, which is due to merge with Russian-owned German rival DEA [RWEDE.UL], would compete in upcoming offshore licensing rounds in Brazil, possibly with partners. “We have been very Norway-focused which is good, but we want to have another area of exploration success,” he said. “The Brazilian coastline is viewed as one of the world’s most promising oil regions,” he added.  Wintershall’s assets so far stretch from oil field concessions in Libya to subsea fields in the North Sea and to Russia’s Arctic regions. It has studied geological data and is ready to co-operate in various arrangements for various assets in Brazil, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, Mehren said. Foreign companies such as Exxon and Statoil, as well as Brazilian firms, could be open to partnerships, he added.  For Wintershall, Brazil would add to its activities in Russia, Argentina, Norway, Libya and Germany. Across the world last year, it repeated 2016’s record output of 165 billion cubic meters (bcm) of oil equivalent (boe).  Wintershall expects significant rises in sales and earnings before special items in 2018, after increasing both steeply in 2017, thanks to higher volumes and higher commodity prices. Oil prices last year increased 23 percent to $54 per barrel on average for North Sea grade Brent. Wintershall’s internal company planning is based on an average price of $65 this year and an exchange rate of $1.2 per euro. It also sees gas prices remaining at current levels in north-western Europe in 2018, after spot gas at European trading hubs rose 24 percent last year. The merger with DEA, which BASF said last week would likely close by the end of the third quarter, will bring synergies in German and Norwegian oil and gas ventures where the two operate separately, and in administration costs, Mehren said.

2018-03-07,"(Repeats with no change to text) By John Kemp LONDON, March 7 (Reuters) - By restraining production, OPEC and its allies have succeeded in eliminating excess oil stocks and accelerating the recovery in prices, but they are paying an increasingly high price in terms of market share. U.S. producers will capture all the growth in global oil consumption this year, according to forecasts from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, March 2018). The agency predicts total crude and liquids production will rise by 2.0 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018. Over the same period, global consumption is expected to rise by just 1.7 million bpd, ensuring the United States captures all of the demand increase this year. Surging U.S. shale production is starting to resemble the last boom, when production rose by 1.0 million bpd in 2012, then 1.2 million bpd in 2013, and another 1.8 million bpd in 2014. During the last boom, U.S. producers captured most of the increase in global demand, pushing the market towards surplus and creating conditions for the subsequent slump in prices. Something similar could happen again. The parallels between the last shale boom and the current surge are uncomfortably close, and the bad news for OPEC does not stop there. The latest forecasts from the International Energy Agency (IEA) show U.S. shale and other producers outside the OPEC/non-OPEC agreement capturing all the growth in global oil demand through the end of the decade. Global consumption is forecast to increase by a total of 3.7 million bpd between 2017 and 2020, according to the IEA (“Oil 2018: analysis and forecasts to 2023”, IEA, March 2018). But U.S. oil production is predicted to increase by almost 3.0 million barrels over the same period, while output from Brazil adds another 700,000 bpd. Rising production from the United States, Brazil, Canada and Norway, all of them outside the OPEC/non-OPEC agreement, will ensure the global market remains well supplied through 2020. As a result, demand for OPEC crude is set to dip slightly in 2018, recover in 2019, then dip again in 2020, the IEA says. According to the agency’s medium-term market forecast, there will be no sustained increase in demand for OPEC crude until at least 2021 or 2022. Even that outlook may be too optimistic for OPEC. The IEA may be under-estimating non-OPEC production, and over-estimating global consumption, both of which could lower demand for OPEC crude compared with the baseline. The IEA forecasts for shale production are conditioned on the current forward price curve, which shows Brent prices falling to $58 per barrel by 2023. However, the oil industry is cyclical. If prices rise, rather than fall, in the next few years, U.S. shale production could grow even faster than the IEA predicts, and demand for OPEC crude would be correspondingly lower. OPEC itself shows every indication of trying to raise oil prices further by reducing its target for global oil inventories and maintaining its output cuts, which threatens to accelerate shale production even more. On the demand side, any long-term forecast must take into account the macroeconomic cycle and possibility of a slowdown in the United States, China or the world economy at some point in the next five years. The IEA’s consumption forecast, which is based on GDP projections from the IMF, assumes global economic growth will remain steady at around 3.7 percent per year through 2023. But the U.S. economic expansion is already the third-longest on record and if it continues will become the second-longest in May 2018 and the longest in July 2019. Most cyclical indicators (including unemployment, capacity utilisation, wages, prices and credit markets) suggest the expansion in the United States and other OECD economies is now fairly mature. To assume the global economy will continue growing steadily for another five years is therefore fairly risky and could prove over-optimistic. For the last 40 years, OPEC’s production policy, under the de facto leadership of Saudi Arabia, has alternated between supporting prices and defending market share. In an ideal world, OPEC would like to protect both, but in practice, the two objectives are in tension with one another. Between 2011 and early 2014, OPEC focused on supporting prices, despite losing market share to U.S. shale firms. Starting in June 2014 and lasting through June 2016, the organisation switched to focus on protecting and rebuilding market share, allowing prices to collapse. Since December 2016, OPEC and it’s non-OPEC allies have reverted to price defence, accepting a reduction in their market share again. OPEC policy is cyclical, so at some point the focus will revert to market share, when the loss of customers becomes too painful. But there are several reasons to think the switch might be delayed this time around. OPEC has always been slow to react to changing market conditions. After previous price slumps, the organisation allowed the market to tighten too much rather than risk not tightening it enough. By allowing prices to rise too far for too long, OPEC has normally created conditions for the next downturn. At the moment, however, the current price-led strategy is still paying short-term dividends for the organisation’s members, including Saudi Arabia. Higher prices are more than offsetting the loss of sales volumes. So there is no pressure to switch course. More importantly, the kingdom seems to want a high and rising oil price to provide a favourable backdrop and maximise the valuation for the sale of shares in Aramco later this year or in 2019. It is very questionable whether either the current spot price of oil or forward curve is strictly relevant to the valuation of Aramco. The company has proved reserves equivalent to almost 60 years of production at the current rate (“Statistical Review of World Energy”, BP, 2017). The company’s valuation, therefore, depends on a long-term view of oil prices through multiple cycles, rather than the current price, as well as its tax treatment and other factors. But senior policymakers seem to have become convinced short-term price dynamics do in fact matter for valuation (“For timing of Aramco IPO, watch forward price curve”, Reuters, Feb. 19). Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has said the company has a value of $2 trillion, so officials are making every effort to prove him right. The political imperative to keep oil prices high to achieve a satisfactory valuation may be distorting the decision-making process. Political considerations may be encouraging Saudi Arabia to allow the oil market to over-tighten, prices to over-shoot, and sacrifice too much market share. As long as the equity sale is pending, the kingdom’s policy is likely to remain focused on boosting prices. Once the sale is complete, it may belatedly start to worry about its eroding market share. But the big complication will arise if U.S. output grows too fast, or oil consumption decelerates, before the Aramco sale is done.

Economic adviser Gary Cohn, seen as a bulwark against protectionist forces within the Trump administration, said on Tuesday he was leaving, sparking a global sell-off across a number of major asset classes. MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.2 percent, having seen some strength in Asian trading following news that South and North Korea would hold their first summit in more than a decade. Equity futures pointed to the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 index opening 0.7 percent lower, with Dow Jones futures down 1 percent. Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility index, was up around 8 percent. In Europe the continent’s car-makers, which face the risk of a hike in import tariffs to the United States, were among the worst performers, falling 0.5 percent. European stocks as a whole recovered some of their early losses to trade down 0.1 percent. “The implication is that without the restraining influence of Cohn on Trump, the president will now have a free hand to press ahead with further tariffs and generally up the ante on trade,” said Neil Wilson, an analyst at ETX Capital. “This in itself does not bode well for risk despite that small boost we saw on news that North Korea could consider de-nuking.” Cohn’s departure rippled through foreign exchange and commodity markets. The U.S. dollar fell 0.4 percent against the Japanese yen — seen a safe-haven in times of uncertainty. The dollar is just off a 14-month low against the yen hit on Friday. “The worst outcome for financial markets, in terms of potential to create volatility, would be a confirmation of rising trade friction and benign neglect of the dollar in the short term,” said analysts at ANZ. The Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso both retreated by more than 0.5 percent against the dollar as Cohn’s departure was seen as raising risks that Washington could walk away from NAFTA negotiations. Commodities fell on worries that trade friction could slow global growth, with Brent crude futures giving up the previous day’s gains to drop 0.5 percent. Copper on the London Metal Exchange lost 1.2 percent, paring a 1.4 percent gain from the previous session. Currencies of commodity producers South Africa and Russia were both down more than 0.5 percent against the dollar, with the rand under particular pressure on falling reserves and business confidence. European government bonds rallied, with yields across the euro zone falling by 1-3 basis points, following similar strengthening in U.S. Treasuries overnight.

2018-03-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s energy regulator wants to trim 5 billion pounds from consumer bills over five years from 2021 by slashing the amount gas and electricity network firms can return to shareholders, it said on Wednesday. Rising energy bills have drawn increasing public criticism, prompting Prime Minister Theresa May promise an end to what she has called “rip off” gas and electricity bills. The government has introduced legislation to parliament to cap prices.. Under its proposals, Ofgem plans to cut the “cost of equity range”, or the amount network firms pay their shareholders, to 3 to 5 percent for the next regulatory period starting 2021, down from 6 to 7 percent now. “In total, we estimate this would result in savings of over 5 billion pounds for household consumers, or about 15-25 pounds per year on the dual fuel household bill, who pay for the network through their energy bills,” Ofgem said. Under Ofgem’s framework, energy network operators set out their plans for investment and how much they expect this to cost over the period. Ofgem sets the return the companies can make. Network firms said Ofgem’s new plans could hurt investment. “Ofgem will need to think very carefully about whether their proposals encourage the necessary investment in critical infrastructure that ensures resilience of the nation’s energy supplies,” Scottish Power Energy Networks said in a statement. Fixed returns have prompted investors to scoop up network assets in recent years, including Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, which in 2016 bought a 16.7 percent stake of the Scotia Gas Networks business from SSE (SSE.L) for 621 million pounds. Other investors in Britain energy network include National Grid (NG.L), Iberdrola’s (IBE.MC) Scottish Power, Australian investment bank Macquarie and Hong Kong’s Cheung Kong Group. Companies have until May 2 to respond to Ofgem’s proposals with the final framework to be set in summer 2018. The current regulatory period runs from 2013 to 2021. Ofgem senior partner for networks, Jonathan Brearley, told reporters the changes would affect company profits “but exactly how that plays into their margins is too early to say.” Brearley said the proposals offered attractive and stable returns but ensured the lowest possible prices for consumers. Ofgem has been criticised by consumer groups for allowing the industry generous returns, while energy suppliers blame rising network costs for price rises. Ofgem data shows network costs make up about 26 percent of an average energy bill. “We will be working through the proposals announced today, including Ofgem’s opening view on what the cost of equity should be,” said David Smith, the chief executive of industry body Energy Networks Association. Ofgem also proposed cutting the regulatory period to five years from eight years, and proposed setting up an independent user and consumer group to challenge and monitor company plans.

2018-03-07,"WASHINGTON, March 7 (Reuters) - A delegation of workers from U.S. oil refining companies that oppose the nation’s biofuels policy will converge on Washington on Wednesday to try to convince lawmakers to find a way to lessen the regulation’s costs without hurting corn farmers. The trip, organized by the United Steelworkers union, marks the latest move in a battle between Big Oil and Big Corn over the fate of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard - a law requiring corn-based ethanol in gasoline that the refining industry says is costing it hundreds of millions of dollars a year. More than two dozen workers from refiners Valero Energy Corp , HollyFrontier Corp, PBF Energy Inc and bankrupt Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) are expected to meet with lawmakers, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, to seek support for changes to the RFS. “We are going to try to explain how the RFS hurts merchant refiners and how there are options on the table to reform the program that don’t hurt the ethanol industry,” said Ryan O’Callaghan, president of the United Steelworkers chapter that represents PES. He said the group would urge changes that could lower costs of the RFS to refiners, including potentially placing a price cap on the blending credits at the center of the program, or by shifting the responsibility for blending fuels off of refiners and further down the supply chain. The RFS currently requires refiners to cover the cost of blending increasing volumes of biofuels like ethanol into the nation’s fuel each year. To prove compliance, refiners must earn or purchase tradeable blending credits, known as RINs - the price of which has skyrocketed in recent years. The program, established in 2007 to help farmers and cut petroleum imports, has been an economic driver in corn-states like Iowa, but merchant refiners say the increasing compliance costs are overly burdensome and put jobs at risk. PES, which employs over 1,000 people in the key electoral state of Pennsylvania, in January blamed its bankruptcy on the costs of the credits. Reuters reported that other factors may also have played a role in its bankruptcy, including the withdrawal of more than $590 million in dividend-style payments from the company by its investor owners. But the company’s financial meltdown has heaped pressure on the White House and lawmakers to address biofuels policy. Last week, President Donald Trump waded deeper into the issue when he told rival groups gathered at the White House that he supported a compromise that temporarily caps credit prices to lower refinery costs, while also lifting restrictions on higher-ethanol blended gasoline to boost corn growers. The Environmental Protection Agency currently limits gasoline to 10 percent ethanol during the summer months, a move intended to reduce ozone emissions and smog during the peak driving season. Like past efforts to overhaul the RFS, Trump’s proposal faces political and legal challenges from ethanol industry advocates that worry a credit price cap would undermine the biofuel program. Another White House meeting initially planned for this week to further discuss the idea may get postponed for logistical reasons, two sources said. In the meantime, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture are preparing an analysis of Trump’s proposals for the White House, the sources said. Outside the White House talks, Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas is also drafting a bill that would alter the RFS to help refiners - though the key elements of his plan also face resistance.

2018-03-07,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Ernest Scheyder HOUSTON, March 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp’s $200 million write-down last month on abandoned ventures in Russia - once its next big frontier - points to challenges facing Chief Executive Darren Woods in his second year leading the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer. Some of the biggest bets taken by his predecessor Rex Tillerson, now the U.S. secretary of state, have resulted in billions of dollars in write-downs amid falling production and a stock price that has long lagged peers. That leaves Woods facing the prospect of slow growth and billions of dollars in new spending that could weigh on results for years. In 2018, the company plans capital spending of about $24 billion - up about a quarter since 2016 - suggesting return on capital will get worse before it gets better as the firm waits for a payoff from new exploration under Woods. Rivals including Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron , by contrast, have capped or cut their spending after finishing expansion projects. Exxon shares are down 18 percent since Woods took over in January 2017. Shell is up 2 percent and Chevron is down about 3 percent during the same period. Woods is feeling the heat from investors who could have made more if they held shares in Exxon’s rivals, as well as activist investors who want to see the company take renewable energy more seriously. Analysts are pushing for more transparency on operations, and some have called for Woods to sell assets. Exxon declined to comment. A State Department spokesperson said Tillerson would have no comment on Exxon matters and referred questions to the company. Exxon is set to host its annual analyst meeting in New York on Wednesday. The firm took the $200 million after-tax charge to walk away from its Russia Kara and Black sea ventures with Rosneft . Five years ago, Exxon touted plans to spend more than $3 billion in Russia, but the firm halted operations in late 2014 when the U.S. sanctioned the country over its military operations in Ukraine. Exxon also took $1.3 billion in charges against Tillerson’s bets on natural gas in Mexico and Canada this year. Last year, it took a $2.13 billion write-down a year earlier - mostly on Rocky Mountain properties tied to Tillerson’s 2010 purchase of natural gas producer XTO Energy Inc. - and disclosed it had reduced estimates of Canadian oil reserves by 3.5 billion barrels. “There’s no question that, over the past handful of years, Exxon has been a relative underperformer,” said Hank Smith, co-chief investment officer of the Haverford Trust, which has held Exxon’s shares for two decades and recently added Royal Dutch Shell to its portfolio. “It’s been frustrating.” Weak results from production have this year cost Exxon its standing as the oil major generating the most cash, a distinction that now goes to Shell. Now, Exxon is spending more cash on projects that will take time to produce. In Guyana, where the company is leading development of an offshore field estimated to hold at least 3.2 billion barrels of oil, Exxon and partners have said they must spend more than $4 billion on developing a project not expected to deliver oil until at least late 2019. More spending awaits Exxon in Qatar, Mozambique and Papua New Guinea for liquefied natural gas projects, and for oil developments in Brazil, Ghana and Mauritania, the company has said. Exxon paid more than $6 billion last year to double its acreage in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield. Exxon’s production there so far is relatively low compared to peers, about 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Exxon says it plans to triple output there through 2025. With all Woods’ development plans, it seems unlikely Exxon’s capital spending will decline after this year, said Simmons & Co analyst Guy Baber. The company did reverse some of the write-downs it took on reserves as oil prices rose. But the company’s inability to translate those gains into robust profits in the final quarter of 2017 was an “epic fail,” said Raymond James oil analyst Pavel Molchanov. Some investors say it’s too soon to evaluate Woods’ tenure despite Exxon’s lagging returns. “There are few decisions that any one person, let alone Woods, could make in the first 12 to 13 months that would be able to really affect the company,” said Mark Stoeckle, portfolio manager of Adams Natural Resources Fund Inc, which holds Exxon’s shares. Exxon retains supporters on Wall Street. Its shares are recommended for purchase by 29 percent of the 24 analysts that cover the company, according to Thomson Reuters data. Half rate the shares as a “hold” and five advise “sell.” Analysts recommending the stock cite the strength of Exxon’s assets. Others, however, want more information on Exxon’s operations. Of the world’s five largest publicly traded oil producers, Exxon ranks last for providing detailed data to investors, while BP Plc is the best, according to an analysis of quarterly earnings regulatory filings by investment researcher Redburn Ltd. BP and Shell, for example, offer more than twice as much data as Exxon on each segment of operations, Redburn found. “Exxon Mobil’s greatest challenge for 2018 might not its valuation, assets or growth, but opening up to investors,” said Redburn oil and gas analyst Rob West.

2018-03-07,"SARAJEVO, March 7 (Reuters) - European power grid lobby ENTSO-E urged Serbia and Kosovo to urgently resolve a dispute over their power grid, which has affected the broader European network, causing some digital clocks on the continent to lose time. The grid shared by Serbia and its former province Kosovo is connected to Europe’s synchronized high voltage power network. ENTSO-E, which represents European electricity transmission operators, said the continental network had lost 113 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of energy since mid-January because Kosovo had been using more electricity than it generates. Serbia, which is responsible for balancing Kosovo’s grid, had failed to do so, ENTSO-E said. The loss of energy had meant that electric clocks that are steered by the frequency of the power system, rather than by a quartz crystal, to lag nearly six minutes behind, ENTSO-E said. Many digital clocks, such as those in alarm clocks and in ovens or microwaves, use the frequency of the power grid to keep time. The problem emerges when the frequency drops over a sustained period of time. ENTSO-E said the European network’s frequency had deviated from its standard of 50 Hertz (Hz) to 49.996 Hz since mid-January, resulting in 113 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of lost energy, although it had appeared to be returning to normal on Tuesday. “Deviation stopped yesterday after Kosovo took some steps but it will take some time to get the system back to normal,” ENTSO-E spokeswoman Susanne Nies told Reuters. She said the risk could remain if there is no political solution to the problem. The political dispute centres mainly on regulatory issues and a row between Serbia and Kosovo over grid operation. It is further complicated by the fact that Belgrade still does not recognise Kosovo. “We will try to fix the technicalities by the end of this week but the question of who will compensate for this loss has to be answered,” Nies said. ENTSO-E urged European governments and policymakers to take swift action and exert pressure on Kosovo and Serbia to resolve the issue, which is also hampering integration of the western Balkans energy market required by the European Union. “These actions need to address the political side of this issue,” ENTSO-E said in a statement. The grid operators in Serbia and Kosovo were not immediately available to comment. Kosovo seceded from Serbia in 2008. Both states want to join the European Union but Brussels says they must normalize relations to forge closer ties with the bloc. Serbia and Kosovo signed an agreement on operating their power grid in 2015. However, it has not been implemented yet as they cannot agree on power distribution in Kosovo amid conflicting claims about ownership of the grid, built when they were both part of Yugoslavia.

2018-03-07,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany’s Continental AG (CONG.DE) has agreed to form a joint venture with China’s CITC Ltd to produce so-called “mild” hybrid batteries that add some electric power to existing petrol models without a costly redesign. The new venture, in which Continental holds 60 percent with the rest owned by Sichuan Chengfei Integration Technology (CITC), will initially produce 48-volt battery systems at its headquarters in Changzhou, near Shanghai, with a view to opening a second production line in Europe at a later stage.  “Entering the 48-volt battery systems business ... will further strengthen our position as a system provider on the fast-growing mild hybrid market,” Continental Chief Executive Elmar Degenhart said in a statement on Wednesday. Carmakers squeezed between carbon emissions restrictions and falling sales of fuel-efficient diesels are looking at affordable 48-volt hybrids as a quick fix. Parts suppliers including Valeo (VLOF.PA) and Delphi (DLPH.N) and carmakers such as PSA Group (PEUP.PA) and Daimler (DAIGn.DE) have embraced the trend. Continental said it was still considering making high-voltage systems based on solid-state battery cells but would for now hold out for more advances to be made in the field, a spokesman said. Domestic rival Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL], the world’s biggest automotive supplier, last month decided against producing its own high-voltage battery cells, saying investments were too risky. CITC, through its subsidiary CALB (China Aviation Lithium Battery Co., Ltd.) will contribute its know-how in producing lithium-ion cells and enable better access to the Chinese market, according to Continental’s statement. Continental said its 48-volt system offered functions previously reserved for more expensive high-voltage systems, such as coasting, fast engine start and recuperation of braking energy.

2018-03-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - As carmakers ramp up spending on self-driving and electric vehicles (EVs), many investors are betting their component suppliers will be the first winners from the technology shifts.  Asked how they are positioning for the changes, investors interviewed by Reuters more often mentioned suppliers like Aptiv (APTV.N), Valeo (VLOF.PA) and Continental (CONG.DE) than the big car brands building them such as Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and Peugeot (PEUP.PA).  That partly reflects a long-term shift toward more complex vehicles where components makers are contributing an ever-larger proportion of a car’s total value.    It is also an acknowledgement that the big innovations are happening as much in the auto industry’s scattered supply base as in the design hubs of the big carmakers, also known as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).  “We ... feel the structural growth opportunities and visibility in the suppliers is higher than for the OEMs where more uncertainties exist, debt is higher and margins/returns typically lower,” said Marcus Morris-Eyton, European equities portfolio manager at Allianz GI.  His Allianz Continental European fund’s main exposure to the EV trend is through German semiconductor maker Infineon (IFXGn.DE), which represents 4.1 percent of the fund, along with tyres and parts supplier Continental.  Thomas Fitzgerald, associate fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management, also holds Infineon stock as an EV/autonomous cars play, as well as Swedish car safety equipment maker Autoliv (ALIVsdb.ST) and Aptiv (APTV.N), the former Delphi businesses now focused on networked EV architecture.  “Those companies providing technology which supports an autonomous, connected, shared and electric transportation system are well positioned to experience heightened levels of profitable growth over the long term,” said Fitzgerald.  While a European index of auto stocks .SXAP is down 1.3 percent this year, that is less than the broader STOXX 600’s  5.1 percent drop and places it among the top-performing European sectors so far in 2018. For carmakers, the shift to EVs carries huge costs and risks, with many slashing billions from their cost base to help offset the lower profitability of electric cars.  Even premium manufacturers with the highest profit margins are bracing for some pain. Daimler says it will face a significantly lower margin “in the beginning of the cycle”.  (For a graphic on 'European autos: still at a discount' click reut.rs/2FlXJIW)  With governments stepping up efforts to reduce pollution, carmakers plan to plough at least $90 billion globally into EVs, according to a Reuters analysis.  Much of this has been driven by strict quotas that China, the world’s largest auto market, has set for new-energy vehicles (NEVs) and which are coming into force in 2019. “We have strongly increased our exposure to this theme as we now believe that EVs are in a position to become competitive in less than five years,” said Lyxor Asset Management’s head of global equities, Fabrice Theveneau.  He expects parts makers to sell more products to OEMs, which he believes will be “net losers” from the EV shift, losing market share to new competitors such as Tesla (TSLA.O) and facing heavy costs to transform their industrial base.  Some investors are wary of the high valuation of many EV-related tech stocks - Infineon rose 38 percent and STMicroelectronics (STM.MI) 69 percent last year - before mass adoption has even begun.  Lyxor’s Theveneau instead favors tyremakers Continental, Pirelli (PIRC.MI) and Michelin (MICP.PA) as he expects demand for premium tyres to pick up as the average EV will drive further than a conventional car.  He also owns shares in battery material miners Glencore (GLEN.L), Eramet (ERMT.PA) and Covestro (1COV.DE) as well as industrial gas makers Linde (LING.DE) and Air Liquide (AIRP.PA) — both plays that offer him an option on the success of hydrogen cars, a rival technology to EV.  Theveneau still has carmakers Renault (RENA.PA), Nissan (7201.T) and Toyota (7203.T) among his top picks. “It’s a race: some of the market shares will change, you don’t know who is going to win in the end.”  Wesley Lebeau, who manages a disruption-themed fund at Amundi’s CPR Asset Management, is also looking along the EV supply chain. Umicore (UMI.BR) is one of his top 10 holdings thanks to its dominant position in cathode materials used in automotive batteries. Lebeau also has exposure to lithium miners SQM (SQM_pb.SN) in Chile and Orocobre (ORE.AX) in Australia.  Gavin Launder, senior portfolio manager in the active equities team at Legal & General Investment Management, is staying positive on the German automakers in particular, saying they will aim to claw back market share in premium EVs from electric car trailblazer Tesla. He says the German car manufacturers tend to be better funded than rivals and have spent more on research and development over the years.  He holds a position in Daimler, which last month unveiled a new Mercedes-Benz A-Class with its own machine-learning and voice recognition technology. “I’m pretty convinced that when Mercedes starts launching electric vehicles that look like Mercedes, that feel like Mercedes, they will have a decent place in the market,” he said.

2018-03-07,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - As U.S. influence in Islamabad wanes, Pakistan’s former adversary Russia is building military, diplomatic and economic ties that could upend historic alliances in the region and open up a fast-growing gas market for Moscow’s energy companies. Russia’s embrace of Pakistan comes at a time when relations between the United States and its historical ally are unravelling over the war in Afghanistan, a remarkable turnaround from the 1980s, when Pakistan helped funnel weapons and U.S. spies across the border to aid Afghan fighters battling Soviet troops.    Though the Moscow-Islamabad rapprochement is in its infancy, and it is neighbour China that is filling the growing void left by the United States in Pakistan, a slew of energy deals and growing military cooperation promise to spark life into the Russia-Pakistan relationship that was dead for many decades.  “It is an opening,” Khurram Dastgir Khan, Pakistan’s defence minister, told Reuters. “Both countries have to work through the past to open the door to the future.” The cosier diplomatic ties have so far focussed on Afghanistan, where Russia has cultivated ties to the Afghan Taliban militants who are fighting U.S. troops and have historic links to Islamabad. Moscow says it is encouraging peace negotiations.  Both Russia and Pakistan are also alarmed by the presence of Islamic State (IS) inside Afghanistan, with Moscow concerned the group’s fighters could spread towards central Asia and closer to home. In Pakistan, IS has already carried out major attacks. “We have common ground on most issues at diplomatic levels,” Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi told Reuters. “It’s a relationship that will grow substantially in the future.” The Russian Foreign Ministry, in an emailed statement to Reuters, said Moscow and Islamabad had been developing cooperation for years, but that the relationship was entering a new qualitative phase. “One of the key areas of cooperation is the fight against terrorism. Russia will continue its practical assistance in bolstering Pakistan’s counter-terrorism capabilities, including by supplying military equipment,” the ministry said. During a trip to Moscow last month by Pakistan’s foreign minister, Khawaja Asif, the two countries announced plans to establish a commission on military cooperation to combat the threat of IS in the region. They also agreed to continue annual military training exercises that began in 2016 and followed the sale of four Russian attack helicopters to Pakistan, as well as the purchase of Russian engines for the Pakistan Air Force’s JF-17 fighter jets that Pakistan’s military assembles on its own soil. The detente has been watched with suspicion by Pakistan’s neighbour and arch-foe India, which broadly stood in the Soviet camp during the Cold War era. In the last two decades, the close Russia-India relationship has been underpinned by huge arms sales by Moscow to a country it calls a “strategic partner”. “If the Russians start backing the Pakistanis in a big way at the political level, then it creates a problem for us,” said Sushant Sareen, a leading expert on India’s relations to Pakistan and Afghanistan with New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation. India’s foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment on Russia’s ties with Pakistan, but has previously said that its own relations with Moscow have stood the test of time, and that the two nations are building up defence and energy relations, including collaboration on nuclear reactors in India.  Russian overtures to Pakistan offer a badly needed diplomatic lifeline for the South Asian nation as it faces growing friction with Western powers over its alleged links to militants. At U.S. urging, and with backing from Britain, France and Germany, a global financial watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), last month decided to place Pakistan back on its watchlist of countries with inadequate terrorist-financing controls, potentially hurting Pakistan’s fragile economy. The U.S. move, which Islamabad angrily dismissed as an effort to “embarrass” Pakistan, followed Washington’s announcement in January to suspend $2 billion in military assistance. Asif, Pakistan’s foreign minister, said his nation made a historical error by “tilting 100 percent” to the West and was now eager build alliances closer to home with the likes of China, Russia and Turkey. “We want to correct the imbalance of our foreign policy over 70 years,” Asif told Reuters. “We are not divorcing that relationship (with the West). But we want to have a balance in our relationships, we want to be closer to our friends in our region.” Defence minister Khan said Pakistan’s military, which has historically been heavily reliant on U.S. weapons and aircraft, may have no choice but to ramp up purchases from the likes of Russia. The cooling relationship with Washington is already pushing Islamabad closer to China, which is investing about $60 billion in infrastructure in Pakistan. But analysts say Pakistan is wary of becoming overly dependent diplomatically on Beijing. Pakistan is among several nations that have been courted by Moscow after falling out with Washington, including the Philippines and Qatar, but Russia’s long-term aims for the Pakistan relationship are unclear, according to Petr Topychkanov, a senior researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.  “It’s not very transparent, even in Russia,” he said. “There is no serious public debate, there is no detailed explanation to the Russian public about what Russia wants in Pakistan.” Russia’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Moscow’s increasingly close relations with Pakistan. Russia and Pakistan are negotiating potential energy deals worth in excess of $10 billion, according to Pakistani energy officials.  Asif said four to five huge power projects “will cement our relationship further”. Russia last month appointed an honorary council in the Pakistan’s northern Khyber Pukhtunkhwa province, where its companies are in talks to build an oil refinery and a power station. But the biggest deals focus on gas supply and infrastructure to Pakistan, one of the world’s fastest growing liquefied natural gas (LNG) import markets. “On a strategic basis, Russia is coming in very fast on the energy side,” said a senior Pakistani energy official. In October, Pakistan and Russia signed an inter-governmental agreement (IGA) on energy, paving the way for Russian state-giant Gazprom to enter negotiations to supply LNG to Pakistan. The talks are expected to conclude within three months and Gazprom is considered “one of the front-runners” to clinch a long-term supply deal, according to the Pakistani official. Based on two monthly LNG cargo deliveries, that deal would be worth about $9 billion over 15 years, he added. There is also growing confidence that a gas pipeline due to be built by Russia, stretching 1,100 km (680 miles) from Lahore to the port city of Karachi, will go ahead. U.S. sanctions against Russian state conglomerate Rostec, as well as a dispute over North-South pipeline transport fees, have held up the $2 billion project since it was signed in 2015. The North-South pipeline would be the biggest infrastructure deal by Russia since early 1970s, when Soviet engineers constructed the Pakistan Steel Mills industrial complex. A Russian company, according to defence minister Khan, is eying up a deal to take over the disused Soviet-built steel mills.

2018-03-07,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, March 7 (Reuters) - By restraining production, OPEC and its allies have succeeded in eliminating excess oil stocks and accelerating the recovery in prices, but they are paying an increasingly high price in terms of market share. U.S. producers will capture all the growth in global oil consumption this year, according to forecasts from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, March 2018). The agency predicts total crude and liquids production will rise by 2.0 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018. Over the same period, global consumption is expected to rise by just 1.7 million bpd, ensuring the United States captures all of the demand increase this year. Surging U.S. shale production is starting to resemble the last boom, when production rose by 1.0 million bpd in 2012, then 1.2 million bpd in 2013, and another 1.8 million bpd in 2014. During the last boom, U.S. producers captured most of the increase in global demand, pushing the market towards surplus and creating conditions for the subsequent slump in prices. Something similar could happen again. The parallels between the last shale boom and the current surge are uncomfortably close, and the bad news for OPEC does not stop there. The latest forecasts from the International Energy Agency (IEA) show U.S. shale and other producers outside the OPEC/non-OPEC agreement capturing all the growth in global oil demand through the end of the decade. Global consumption is forecast to increase by a total of 3.7 million bpd between 2017 and 2020, according to the IEA (“Oil 2018: analysis and forecasts to 2023”, IEA, March 2018). But U.S. oil production is predicted to increase by almost 3.0 million barrels over the same period, while output from Brazil adds another 700,000 bpd. Rising production from the United States, Brazil, Canada and Norway, all of them outside the OPEC/non-OPEC agreement, will ensure the global market remains well supplied through 2020. As a result, demand for OPEC crude is set to dip slightly in 2018, recover in 2019, then dip again in 2020, the IEA says. According to the agency’s medium-term market forecast, there will be no sustained increase in demand for OPEC crude until at least 2021 or 2022. Even that outlook may be too optimistic for OPEC. The IEA may be under-estimating non-OPEC production, and over-estimating global consumption, both of which could lower demand for OPEC crude compared with the baseline. The IEA forecasts for shale production are conditioned on the current forward price curve, which shows Brent prices falling to $58 per barrel by 2023. However, the oil industry is cyclical. If prices rise, rather than fall, in the next few years, U.S. shale production could grow even faster than the IEA predicts, and demand for OPEC crude would be correspondingly lower. OPEC itself shows every indication of trying to raise oil prices further by reducing its target for global oil inventories and maintaining its output cuts, which threatens to accelerate shale production even more. On the demand side, any long-term forecast must take into account the macroeconomic cycle and possibility of a slowdown in the United States, China or the world economy at some point in the next five years. The IEA’s consumption forecast, which is based on GDP projections from the IMF, assumes global economic growth will remain steady at around 3.7 percent per year through 2023. But the U.S. economic expansion is already the third-longest on record and if it continues will become the second-longest in May 2018 and the longest in July 2019. Most cyclical indicators (including unemployment, capacity utilisation, wages, prices and credit markets) suggest the expansion in the United States and other OECD economies is now fairly mature. To assume the global economy will continue growing steadily for another five years is therefore fairly risky and could prove over-optimistic. For the last 40 years, OPEC’s production policy, under the de facto leadership of Saudi Arabia, has alternated between supporting prices and defending market share. In an ideal world, OPEC would like to protect both, but in practice, the two objectives are in tension with one another. Between 2011 and early 2014, OPEC focused on supporting prices, despite losing market share to U.S. shale firms. Starting in June 2014 and lasting through June 2016, the organisation switched to focus on protecting and rebuilding market share, allowing prices to collapse. Since December 2016, OPEC and it’s non-OPEC allies have reverted to price defence, accepting a reduction in their market share again. OPEC policy is cyclical, so at some point the focus will revert to market share, when the loss of customers becomes too painful. But there are several reasons to think the switch might be delayed this time around. OPEC has always been slow to react to changing market conditions. After previous price slumps, the organisation allowed the market to tighten too much rather than risk not tightening it enough. By allowing prices to rise too far for too long, OPEC has normally created conditions for the next downturn. At the moment, however, the current price-led strategy is still paying short-term dividends for the organisation’s members, including Saudi Arabia. Higher prices are more than offsetting the loss of sales volumes. So there is no pressure to switch course. More importantly, the kingdom seems to want a high and rising oil price to provide a favourable backdrop and maximise the valuation for the sale of shares in Aramco later this year or in 2019. It is very questionable whether either the current spot price of oil or forward curve is strictly relevant to the valuation of Aramco. The company has proved reserves equivalent to almost 60 years of production at the current rate (“Statistical Review of World Energy”, BP, 2017). The company’s valuation, therefore, depends on a long-term view of oil prices through multiple cycles, rather than the current price, as well as its tax treatment and other factors. But senior policymakers seem to have become convinced short-term price dynamics do in fact matter for valuation (“For timing of Aramco IPO, watch forward price curve”, Reuters, Feb. 19). Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has said the company has a value of $2 trillion, so officials are making every effort to prove him right. The political imperative to keep oil prices high to achieve a satisfactory valuation may be distorting the decision-making process. Political considerations may be encouraging Saudi Arabia to allow the oil market to over-tighten, prices to over-shoot, and sacrifice too much market share. As long as the equity sale is pending, the kingdom’s policy is likely to remain focused on boosting prices. Once the sale is complete, it may belatedly start to worry about its eroding market share. But the big complication will arise if U.S. output grows too fast, or oil consumption decelerates, before the Aramco sale is done.

2018-03-07,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Top officials from China’s two largest oil and gas producers have urged the government to offer tax breaks for the building of gas storage facilities and importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) to help avoid another gas crunch in the winter ahead.      Sinopec (600028.SS) Vice President Ma Yongsheng said the central government should subsidize the construction of underground gas storage, LNG tanks and other facilities.     China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) [CNPET.UL] President Wang Yilin urged the government to refund value added tax on LNG imports to lower gas costs for consumers.  Members of parliament and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the Communist Party’s largely ceremonial advisory body, are encouraged to submit suggestions for future legislation during the current Parliament session. Their chances of becoming legislation are minimal, but they can form part of future laws.         The proposals from Sinopec and CNPC come as the nation looks for ways to increase storage capacity for natural gas to avoid a repeat of this past winter’s heating crisis.  Millions of households in northern China switched from using coal to natural gas for heating ahead of this past winter, leading to sky-rocketing gas consumption as well shortages across many regions.  The fuel shortages over the last three or four months deepened China’s worries over whether it can secure enough gas and LNG supplies in winters ahead.  CNPC’s Wang said China’s gas demand will grow 15 to 16 percent in 2018 and supplies will continue to be tight, according to a transcript of his speech to a parliament meeting session published in CNPC’s official newspaper.  Sinopec’s Kong Fanqun, who heads the Shengli Oil field said a lack of storage facilities also contributed to China’s gas shortages this winter, according to a transcript of his speech sent to Reuters by the Sinopec Group.  The country needs an additional 50 billion cubic meters (bcm) of storage facilities by 2020 to meet its own demand, Kong said. That is five times the size of China’s current gas storage facilities.  Kong asked the government to give gas producers subsidies as well tax breaks to build and operate gas storage facilities. Both Sinopec and CNPC officials also proposed removing resource taxes on the development of shale gas, coalbed methane, high sulfur gas and tight gas reserves.

2018-03-07,"* World and European stocks down 0.2 pct * Cohn’s departure seen as tilting U.S. towards protectionism * Dollar falls vs yen, Swiss franc; Canada dlr, Mexico peso fall * Crude oil slips, gold extends rally amid risk aversion * For a live blog on European stocks, type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window By Alasdair Pal LONDON, March 7 (Reuters) - Global stocks and the dollar fell on Wednesday after a strong advocate of free trade resigned from the White House, fanning fears that U.S. President Donald Trump will proceed with protectionist tariffs and risk a trade war. Economic adviser Gary Cohn, seen as a bulwark against protectionist forces within the Trump administration, said on Tuesday he was leaving, sparking a global sell-off across a number of major asset classes. MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.2 percent, having seen some strength in Asian trading following news that South and North Korea would hold their first summit in more than a decade. The pan-European Stoxx 600 was down 0.4 percent, with Germany’s DAX, home to many export-led companies, down 0.5 percent. European car-makers, which face the risk of a hike in import tariffs to the United States, were among the worst performers, falling 1.1 percent. Equity futures pointed to the U.S. S&P 500 index opening 0.8 percent lower. “The implication is that without the restraining influence of Cohn on Trump, the president will now have a free hand to press ahead with further tariffs and generally up the ante on trade,” said Neil Wilson, an analyst at ETX Capital. “This in itself does not bode well for risk despite that small boost we saw on news that North Korea could consider de-nuking.” Cohn’s departure rippled through foreign exchange markets, with the U.S. dollar falling 0.4 percent and 0.2 percent respectively against the Japanese yen and Swiss franc — both seen as safe-havens in times of uncertainty. The dollar is just off a 14-month low against the yen hit on Friday. “The worst outcome for financial markets, in terms of potential to create volatility, would be a confirmation of rising trade friction and benign neglect of the dollar in the short term,” said analysts at ANZ. The Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso both retreated by around 0.5 percent against the dollar as Cohn’s departure was seen as raising risks that Washington could walk away from NAFTA negotiations. Other emerging market currencies that typically move in sympathy with the dollar were lower, with the South African rand and Russian rouble both down around 0.5 percent against the dollar. Commodities fell on worries that trade friction could slow global growth, with Brent crude futures giving up the previous day’s gains to drop 1.2 percent. Copper on the London Metal Exchange lost 0.9 percent, paring a 1.4 percent gain from the previous session. European government bonds rallied, with yields across the euro zone falling by 1-3 basis points, following similar strengthening in U.S. Treasuries overnight.

Woodside’s rights to develop the Grassy Point LNG site, about 30 km north of Prince Rupert, expired on Jan. 15, and the company said on Wednesday it had decided not to renew the agreement. “The decision was made after careful consideration of our long-term development strategy in Canada,” Woodside said in an emailed statement after the step was initially reported by Canada’s Globe and Mail. “We are focusing on the Kitimat LNG project in which we are a 50-percent partner with Chevron,” Woodside said. The company had done little work on the Grassy Point project to export up to 20 million tonnes a year of LNG, and did not mention it in growth plans outlined last May. The decision to scrap Grassy Point adds to a string of LNG projects that have been delayed or shelved in Canada due to a global LNG supply glut. Woodside flagged last year that Kitimat, which has a 20-year, 10 million tonnes a year export licence, was part of its growth plans for beyond 2026. Chevron is considering selling part of its stake in Kitimat, Reuters reported this week.

2018-03-07,"SINGAPORE/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - East Timor and Australia this week signed a treaty at the United Nations setting their maritime boundary for the first time, and striking a deal on sharing an estimated $65 billion (46.8 billion pounds) in potential revenues from the Greater Sunrise gas fields in the Timor Sea. For impoverished East Timor, with a population of just 1.3 million, development of the fields is crucial — its main source of revenue since 2004, the Bayu Undan gas field, is set to run out of gas by 2022. The treaty signing in New York on Tuesday marked the first conciliation under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) — a process UN Secretary‑General António Guterres said could offer other countries a path towards resolving contentious maritime boundary disputes. At current market prices, the Greater Sunrise reserves would be worth more than 23 times East Timor’s annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of $2.8 billion. Development of the reserves has been held back by the maritime border dispute between Australia and East Timor, a former Portuguese colony that gained independence from Indonesia in 2002. “The treaty is an important step that opens the way for developing a rich, shared resource, the Greater Sunrise gas fields. We know this resource is crucial to Timor Leste’s development,” said Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who signed the treaty in New York on Tuesday with East Timor’s Deputy Minister of the Prime Minister for the Delimitation of Borders Hermenegildo Augusto Cabral Pereira. However, the Greater Sunrise joint venture, led by Australia’s Woodside Petroleum, which has been a key party in the long-running negotiation, said it was disappointed that the treaty did not contain a full development plan for the gas reserves. “It is disappointing that this process has not resulted in an alignment on a development concept,” the Sunrise joint venture said in a statement on Wednesday. The Sunrise partners did not specify what they felt was missing in the agreement, but it is likely that Dili insisted on the gas being processed in East Timor for overseas sale, while the joint venture would prefer to pipe the gas to Australia. Under the terms of the deal, East Timor will get 70 percent of revenues if processing takes place in East Timor, and 80 percent should the gas be piped to Australia. That compares with an equal share under a 2006 agreement between Dili and Canberra.  The Sunrise and Troubadour gas fields, collectively known as Greater Sunrise, lie beneath waters 100 to 600 metres deep, making them shallow to medium-deepwater developments. The fields were discovered in 1974 and, according to Woodside, hold around 5.13 trillion cubic feet of gas, the equivalent of more than a third of current annual global LNG consumption. At current market prices, the LNG would be worth almost $50 billion. Like most gas fields in the wider region, including Papua New Guinea’s and Australia’s huge liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports facilities, Greater Sunrise also contains significant amounts of condensate, an ultra-light form of crude oil. Its 225.9 million barrels of condensate reserves at current market prices would be worth over $15 billion. Woodside and its partners have long said they would prefer to develop the fields using a floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) platform, considered the most cost-effective option, as the fields are 150km away from East Timor and 450km away from Darwin in Australia. However the agreement signed on Tuesday lays out just two options — piping the gas either to East Timor or Australia. Dili has long pressed for the gas to be processed in East Timor, looking to generate thousands of jobs in construction and, once developed, in the lucrative oil and gas processing, storage, transport and petrochemical industries. Australia, however, has existing gas infrastructure and an experienced workforce, making it the industry’s preferred location. The partners in Greater Sunrise are Australia’s Woodside, U.S. firm ConocoPhillips, Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell and Japan’s Osaka Gas. Even with the new agreement, development could be years away. Woodside said last May it may only develop Greater Sunrise after 2027. Energy markets are just recovering from years of oversupply that depressed oil and gas prices and deterred development of new gas projects. Asia’s LNG markets, which Greater Sunrise would serve, are expected to remain oversupplied into the early 2020s as production rises in Australia, North America, Papua New Guinea and also Qatar. It’s likely the Sunrise partners will bide their time before committing billions of dollars to develop such a large project.

2018-03-07,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - A magnitude 6.7 earthquake struck Papua New Guinea’s mountainous Southern Highlands on Wednesday killing at least 18 people, an official said, a week after a larger quake flattened villages and killed at least 55 people.  The tremor, shortly after midnight local time, struck just 31 km (19 miles) southwest of the epicentre of last Monday’s magnitude 7.5 quake that has left government and aid agencies scrambling to provide emergency supplies to the remote region. Australia and New Zealand said on Wednesday they would increase aid to Papua New Guinea. Australia will deploy three helicopters this week to deliver aid, while New Zealand will send a second military plane to distribute medical equipment, hygiene kits and tarpaulins. Wednesday’s quake was the most severe of a series of aftershocks that have rattled the resource-rich region, about 600 km (370 miles) northwest of the capital Port Moresby. William Bando, the administrator of Hela Province, said initial reports put the death toll from the aftershock at 18. “It appears Hides was hardest hit. We haven’t heard about potential casualties there yet, but it is a big village with many people,” he added. Manasseh Makiba, Papua New Guinea’s Vice Minister for Petroleum & Energy who represents parts of Hela Province in parliament, said victims were still being found. “People are still being extracted from mud. People are still being taken to hospitals,” he said. Local media outlets reported the death toll from the original quake had risen to 75, after government officials said previously that 55 people had been killed. A spokeswoman at Papua New Guinea’s National Disaster Centre said on Wednesday that authorities were finalising a final report into the casualties from the first quake. (GRAPHIC: Papua New Guinea quake IMG, tmsnrt.rs/2ow1YL)  James Komengi, a United Church project officer, speaking from Tari, the capital of quake-affected Hela province, said his church’s assessment and response centre had counted up to 67 deaths in that province alone. Aid efforts are being hampered as rescue workers struggle to reach the highlands area as many roads are either badly damaged or blocked. The International Red Cross warned the situation could deteriorate if heavy rains hit the region. “We are anxious to reach communities while there is a lull in what is usually a season of heavy rain. A big downpour could bring landslides in hillsides already destabilised by the earthquake, cause floods and contaminate water,” said Udaya Regmi, Director the International Red Cross in Papua New Guinea. The Red Cross said its initial assessments indicate that as many as 143,000 people could have been affected, with an estimated 500 people injured and 17,000 people displaced from their homes. Even in more accessible areas of the country, health facilities have been damaged. ExxonMobil (XOM.N), which shut its $19 billion PNG liquefied natural gas (LNG) project after the first quake, said on Wednesday its facilities in Hides, where it runs a gas conditioning plant, were safely shut in. All employees and contractors were safe.

2018-03-07,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp’s (XOM.N) $200 million write-down last month on abandoned ventures in Russia - once its next big frontier - points to challenges facing Chief Executive Darren Woods in his second year leading the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer.  Some of the biggest bets taken by his predecessor Rex Tillerson, now the U.S. secretary of state, have resulted in billions of dollars in write-downs amid falling production and a stock price that has long lagged peers. That leaves Woods facing the prospect of slow growth and billions of dollars in new spending that could weigh on results for years. In 2018, the company plans capital spending of about $24 billion - up about a quarter since 2016 - suggesting return on capital will get worse before it gets better as the firm waits for a payoff from new exploration under Woods. Graphic on Exxon's Quarterly Earnings: tmsnrt.rs/1WQwElC Rivals including Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Chevron (CVX.N), by contrast, have capped or cut their spending after finishing expansion projects. Exxon shares are down 18 percent since Woods took over in January 2017. Shell is up 2 percent and Chevron is down about 3 percent during the same period. Woods is feeling the heat from investors who could have made more if they held shares in Exxon’s rivals, as well as activist investors who want to see the company take renewable energy more seriously. Analysts are pushing for more transparency on operations, and some have called for Woods to sell assets. Graphic on Exxon's Cash Stumble: reut.rs/2Ey6S1s Exxon declined to comment. A State Department spokesperson said Tillerson would have no comment on Exxon matters and referred questions to the company. Exxon is set to host its annual analyst meeting in New York on Wednesday. The firm took the $200 million after-tax charge to walk away from its Russia Kara and Black sea ventures with Rosneft (ROSN.MM). Five years ago, Exxon touted plans to spend more than $3 billion in Russia, but the firm halted operations in late 2014 when the U.S. sanctioned the country over its military operations in Ukraine. Graphic on Commodity Performance in 2018: tmsnrt.rs/2jvdmXl Exxon also took $1.3 billion in charges against Tillerson’s bets on natural gas in Mexico and Canada this year. Last year, it took a $2.13 billion write-down a year earlier - mostly on Rocky Mountain properties tied to Tillerson’s 2010 purchase of natural gas producer XTO Energy Inc. - and disclosed it had reduced estimates of Canadian oil reserves by 3.5 billion barrels. “There’s no question that, over the past handful of years, Exxon has been a relative underperformer,” said Hank Smith, co-chief investment officer of the Haverford Trust, which has held Exxon’s shares for two decades and recently added Royal Dutch Shell to its portfolio. “It’s been frustrating.” Weak results from production have this year cost Exxon its standing as the oil major generating the most cash, a distinction that now goes to Shell. Now, Exxon is spending more cash on projects that will take time to produce. In Guyana, where the company is leading development of an offshore field estimated to hold at least 3.2 billion barrels of oil, Exxon and partners have said they must spend more than $4 billion on developing a project not expected to deliver oil until at least late 2019.  More spending awaits Exxon in Qatar, Mozambique and Papua New Guinea for liquefied natural gas projects, and for oil developments in Brazil, Ghana and Mauritania, the company has said. Exxon paid more than $6 billion last year to double its acreage in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield. Exxon’s production there so far is relatively low compared to peers, about 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Exxon says it plans to triple output there through 2025. With all Woods’ development plans, it seems unlikely Exxon’s capital spending will decline after this year, said Simmons & Co analyst Guy Baber. The company did reverse some of the write-downs it took on reserves as oil prices rose. But the company’s inability to translate those gains into robust profits in the final quarter of 2017 was an “epic fail,” said Raymond James oil analyst Pavel Molchanov. Some investors say it’s too soon to evaluate Woods’ tenure despite Exxon’s lagging returns.  “There are few decisions that any one person, let alone Woods, could make in the first 12 to 13 months that would be able to really affect the company,” said Mark Stoeckle, portfolio manager of Adams Natural Resources Fund Inc (PEO.N), which holds Exxon’s shares.  Exxon retains supporters on Wall Street. Its shares are recommended for purchase by 29 percent of the 24 analysts that cover the company, according to Thomson Reuters data. Half rate the shares as a “hold” and five advise “sell.” Analysts recommending the stock cite the strength of Exxon’s assets.  Others, however, want more information on Exxon’s operations. Of the world’s five largest publicly traded oil producers, Exxon ranks last for providing detailed data to investors, while BP Plc (BP.L) is the best, according to an analysis of quarterly earnings regulatory filings by investment researcher Redburn Ltd. BP and Shell, for example, offer more than twice as much data as Exxon on each segment of operations, Redburn found. “Exxon Mobil’s greatest challenge for 2018 might not its valuation, assets or growth, but opening up to investors,” said Redburn oil and gas analyst Rob West.

2018-03-07,"(Repeats story first published Tuesday with no changes) By Ernest Scheyder and Ron Bousso HOUSTON, March 7 (Reuters) - Around the room at Houston’s The Grove restaurant on Monday, at several tables, sat a group of shale executives, interspersed with energy ministers and officials representing OPEC members, where they dined on fish and steak. They should have had a lot to discuss amid the fervor of CERAWeek, the most notable U.S. energy event of the year. But what could have been two of the biggest topics of conversation - oil prices and OPEC output levels - were not in the cards, as such a broad conversation would run afoul of U.S. antitrust rules against price-fixing. “It was quite a congenial group of people. We had a really wonderful conversation,” said Tim Dove, CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources Co. He noted that Mohammed Barkindo, OPEC secretary general, gave a speech, and “his main message was that they believe very strongly that demand is going to be significant moving forward in terms of growth.” Just a year-and-a-half ago, such a gathering would have been difficult. The two sides were involved in a price war that left many shale firms bankrupt. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped all-out from 2014, pushing down the oil price in a campaign for market share aimed at pushing the shale industry out of business. The price war sparked an industry recession, and oil prices plunged to a low of $27 a barrel. But shale cut costs and survived, and eventually the low price was too much for OPEC members to bear. OPEC cut output in 2017, effectively making way for shale. Since then, there has been an uneasy truce between OPEC and the shale industry. Even as OPEC ministers sit down with shale executives, it still grates for them that they have had to cut production and cede market share to U.S. oil firms that pump as much as they can. U.S. firms cannot engage in agreements to control supply or push up prices due to anti-trust laws in the United States. But shale firms are enjoying the benefits of OPEC members doing what they cannot, driving U.S. production to a record in late 2017 at more than 10 million barrels a day. Occasionally, OPEC ministers show signs of their frustration. Nigerian Oil Minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu told Reuters on Monday that “some of the same companies that are working in shale are the same companies working in OPEC,” and that they should “take some responsibilities in terms of stability of oil prices.” At the same industry gathering a year ago, Saudi Arabia’s oil minister said his country should not have to underwrite the investments of others. But both OPEC ministers and shale executives know that there is nothing, really, that shale firms can do. Several executives in Houston this week - including at least one who attended Monday’s dinner - declined to discuss the meet-up. “The dinner was just generalizations and platitudes,” said Mark Papa, CEO of Centennial Resources Development Inc, who also attended. “It’s just a statement that everyone will work together to make sure the oil market is well-supplied and everyone is happy to be working together,” he said. Along with Barkindo, ministers from Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Equatorial Guinea were in attendance. “The key thing is that information is shared about our projections; it really helps everybody,” Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima, Equatorial Guinea’s petroleum minister, told Reuters of the discussion at the dinner, which he attended. “The important thing is to know how much they (shale) are investing and their projections because usually they have good statistics,” he said. “What we are doing is avoiding volatility.” But ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance, speaking Tuesday at the conference, said “We’ve just decided to embrace volatility. The growth in the U.S. is coming. It’ll probably consume most of the incremental demand. So OPEC is needed to show restraint in order to continue to balance that market.” Lance was one of at least five executives from U.S. oil companies who declined invitations to attend, according to sources familiar at those companies, who did not want to be named. But Dove said Barkindo’s speech at the dinner suggests an understanding of the shared challenge in meeting global demand. “It’s the shale producers, it’s the OPEC producers, it’s the non-OPEC producers that are going to be needed to make sure we fill that demand as we go through the next many years,” Dove said. “From that standpoint, I think shale has an important role to play, and I think that was acknowledged last night.” Reporting by Ernest Schedyer and Ron Bousso; Writing by David

So OPEC is needed to show restraint in order to continue to balance that market.” Lance was one of at least five executives from U.S. oil companies who declined invitations to attend, according to sources familiar at those companies, who did not want to be named. But Dove said Barkindo’s speech at the dinner suggests an understanding of the shared challenge in meeting global demand. “It’s the shale producers, it’s the OPEC producers, it’s the non-OPEC producers that are going to be needed to make sure we fill that demand as we go through the next many years,” Dove said.  “From that standpoint, I think shale has an important role to play, and I think that was acknowledged last night.”       Reporting by Ernest Schedyer and Ron Bousso; Writing by David Gaffen; Editing by Lisa Shumaker",https://uk.reuters.com/article/ceraweek-energy-opec-shale/ceraweek-u-s-shale-and-opec-share-steak-in-uneasy-truce-at-houston-dinner-idUKL2N1QP04P,07 Mar 2018,"Around the room at Houston's

2018-03-07,"* Global markets drop as key Trump adviser departs * Gary Cohn opposed Trump plans for steel, aluminium tariffs * Soaring U.S. crude ouutput, rising stocks also weigh * U.S. crude output to rise to 11.17 mln bpd by Q4 - EIA By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, March 7 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday, pulled down by weaker sharemarkets after a key advocate for free trade in the U.S. government resigned, triggering concerns that Washington would go ahead with import tariffs and risk a trade war. Soaring U.S. crude oil production and rising inventories were also weighing on crude prices, traders said. Gary Cohn, economic adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, seen as a bulwark against protectionist forces within the government, said on Tuesday he was resigning, triggering a more than 1 percent fall in S&P 500 futures in early Wednesday trade. Crude oil futures followed suit. Brent crude futures were at $65.37 per barrel at 0149 GMT, down 42 cents, or 0.6 percent from their previous close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $62.16 a barrel, down 44 cents, or 0.7 percent. “The overhang from the Cohn resignation ... could see oil prices move lower during today’s session,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. A voice for Wall Street in the White House, Cohn’s move to resign came after he lost a fight over Trump’s plans for hefty steel and aluminum import tariffs. Major powers, including the European Union and China, have warned that such tariffs could lead to retaliatory action and trigger a global trade war, which could grind to a halt economic growth and, by extension, oil consumption. Traders said oil prices were also weighed by a reported rise in U.S. crude oil inventories. Crude inventories rose by 5.661 million barrels in the week to 426.880 million barrels, data from the American Petroleum Institute showed on Tuesday. Official data by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) is due to be published later on Wednesday. Overall, oil supplies are ample despite efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to withhold output in order to prop up prices. The EIA on Tuesday made its latest in a series of upward revisions for U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA, which it now expects to rise by more than 120,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 11.17 million bpd by the fourth quarter of 2018. That would take the United States past Russia to become the world’s biggest oil producer. The U.S. already passed top exporter Saudi Arabia late last year. For 2019, the EIA forecast a crude production increase of 570,000 bpd to 11.27 million bpd.

White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, seen as a bulwark against protectionist forces within the Trump administration, said on Tuesday he was leaving. S&P 500 futures dropped more than one percent and set the downbeat tone for Asia. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.25 percent. Australian stocks fell 0.75 percent and Japan’s Nikkei retreated 0.2 percent. “If you’re looking for an excuse to sell, this is the kind of announcement that certainly causes short-term downward pressure,” said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in New Jersey, regarding Cohn’s resignation. “He (Cohn) came from Wall street and certainly large institutional investors felt he was very credible in his spot.” South Korea’s KOSPI bucked the trend and rose 0.3 percent amid a perceived easing of regional tensions, following news on Tuesday that South Korea would hold its first summit with the North in more than a decade. Cohn’s resignation, however, poured cold water on a recovery in risk appetite in wider markets that followed news of the inter-Korean talks. In the currency market, the dollar fell as much as 0.6 percent to 105.45 yen, near its 16-month low of 105.24 touched on Friday. The dollar had risen to 106.470 on Tuesday amid speculation that Trump could be coaxed away from imposing tariffs. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar also shed 0.3 percent to 0.9375 franc, while the euro edged up 0.05 percent to $1.2412. “The worst outcome for financial markets, in terms of potential to create volatility, would be a confirmation of rising trade friction and benign neglect of the dollar in the short term,” said analysts at ANZ. The Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso tumbled as Cohn’s departure was seen as raising risks Washington could walk out of NAFTA. The Canadian dollar fell 0.5 percent to C$1.2936 per dollar while the Mexican peso dropped 0.5 percent to 18.83 to the dollar. Crude oil prices fell as investor risk appetite in the broader markets cooled, with Brent futures surrendering the previous day’s gains to drop 0.85 percent to $65.24 per barrel. Spot gold stretched the previous day’s rally and touched $1,340.42 an ounce, highest since Feb. 26. Other safe havens like government bonds also fared well. U.S. Treasury debt prices rose and as a result the 10-year benchmark note yield declined 2 basis points to 2.858 percent. Reporting by Hideyuki Sano and Shinichi Saoshiro in Tokyo;

2018-03-07,"HOUSTON, March 6 (Reuters) - Around the room at Houston’s The Grove restaurant on Monday, at several tables, sat a group of shale executives, interspersed with energy ministers and officials representing OPEC members, where they dined on fish and steak. They should have had a lot to discuss amid the fervor of CERAWeek, the most notable U.S. energy event of the year. But what could have been two of the biggest topics of conversation - oil prices and OPEC output levels - were not in the cards, as such a broad conversation would run afoul of U.S. antitrust rules against price-fixing. “It was quite a congenial group of people. We had a really wonderful conversation,” said Tim Dove, CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources Co. He noted that Mohammed Barkindo, OPEC secretary general, gave a speech, and “his main message was that they believe very strongly that demand is going to be significant moving forward in terms of growth.” Just a year-and-a-half ago, such a gathering would have been difficult. The two sides were involved in a price war that left many shale firms bankrupt. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped all-out from 2014, pushing down the oil price in a campaign for market share aimed at pushing the shale industry out of business. The price war sparked an industry recession, and oil prices plunged to a low of $27 a barrel. But shale cut costs and survived, and eventually the low price was too much for OPEC members to bear. OPEC cut output in 2017, effectively making way for shale. Since then, there has been an uneasy truce between OPEC and the shale industry. Even as OPEC ministers sit down with shale executives, it still grates for them that they have had to cut production and cede market share to U.S. oil firms that pump as much as they can. U.S. firms cannot engage in agreements to control supply or push up prices due to anti-trust laws in the United States. But shale firms are enjoying the benefits of OPEC members doing what they cannot, driving U.S. production to a record in late 2017 at more than 10 million barrels a day. Occasionally, OPEC ministers show signs of their frustration. Nigerian Oil Minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu told Reuters on Monday that “some of the same companies that are working in shale are the same companies working in OPEC,” and that they should “take some responsibilities in terms of stability of oil prices.” At the same industry gathering a year ago, Saudi Arabia’s oil minister said his country should not have to underwrite the investments of others. But both OPEC ministers and shale executives know that there is nothing, really, that shale firms can do. Several executives in Houston this week - including at least one who attended Monday’s dinner - declined to discuss the meet-up. “The dinner was just generalizations and platitudes,” said Mark Papa, CEO of Centennial Resources Development Inc, who also attended. “It’s just a statement that everyone will work together to make sure the oil market is well-supplied and everyone is happy to be working together,” he said. Along with Barkindo, ministers from Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Equatorial Guinea were in attendance, a source familiar said. “The key thing is that information is shared about our projections; it really helps everybody,” Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima, Equatorial Guinea’s petroleum minister, told Reuters of the discussion at the dinner, which he attended. “What we are doing is avoiding volatility.” But ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance, speaking Tuesday at the conference, said “We’ve just decided to embrace volatility.

2018-03-07,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An international project to build a nuclear fusion reactor in France that would start generating electricity in 17 years will face delays if Trump administration cuts are not reversed in a few months, the head of the venture said on Tuesday. Bernard Bigot, director-general of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor project, or ITER, said the administration’s budget cuts would reduce the U.S. contribution to the project and lead to construction delays. “It’s not a question of capability, it’s a question of political will,” Bigot said in a telephone interview while he was in Washington to meet with U.S. officials. The Energy Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ITER, launched 10 years ago by seven partners: the European Union, the United States, China, India, Japan, Russia and South Korea, would generate electricity from a process similar to the nuclear fusion that powers the sun.  Conventional reactors split atoms to generate power and create poisonous nuclear waste, for which there is no permanent disposal site in the United States.  The cost of the experimental project, which its partners hope will reach its first full-power fusion by 2035 is $21 billion to $26 billion.  The United States has given about $1 billion to ITER so far, and had been planning to contribute an additional $500 million through 2025.  But with U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed budget cuts, Washington’s contribution for 2019 would drop to $75 million from $165 million. Last year, the administration cut the 2018 U.S. contribution to $63 million from a planned $120 million.    Bigot said he told officials from the Energy Department, the White House’s office of science and technology policy and the State Department, that the project will face delays unless Washington promises by June to fund the original amounts.  If the United States, which provides 9 percent of ITER’s funding, does not contribute the planned tens of millions of dollars on time, contracts for assembling large parts of the project will be delayed, he said. In December Shaylyn Hynes, an energy department spokeswoman, said that the administration is reviewing civilian nuclear policy, including research and development, which will influence its policy toward ITER going forward.

2018-03-07,"EDMONTON, Canada, March 6 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - W ealthy cities are responsible for a huge share of greenhouse-gas emissions when calculations include goods they consume from developing countries, researchers said on Tuesday, challenging traditional estimates that put blame on manufacturing nations. Looking at emissions based on consumption, affluent cities, mostly in North America and Europe, emit 60 percent more greenhouse gases than they do using traditional calculations, researchers said at a United Nations-backed climate summit. Calculating emissions of greenhouse gases, which are blamed for global warming, traditionally looks at where goods such as cellular phones or plastic cups are produced, they said. But consumption-based emissions presents a fuller picture by attributing emissions to the consumers rather than the manufacturers, said Mark Watts, head of C40, an alliance of more than 90 global cities. The newer method of calculation puts the responsibility on richer consumers and “increases the scope of things that policy makers in cities can address to reduce emissions,” Watts said. Cities account for an estimated 75 percent of carbon emissions, according to U.N. figures used at the summit. The estimate by C40 comes amid concern that national governments are not on track to meet the pledges they made in 2015 in Paris to reduce greenhouse gases and curb climate change. Traditional calculations put manufacturing countries such as China and India amid the lead emitters of greenhouse gases. Using consumption-based calculations, emissions in 15 affluent cities were three times more than they were with traditional figuring, the researchers said. Using consumption-based emissions is “revolutionary” although still “on the periphery,” said Debra Roberts, a co-chairwoman on the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “But ... these are ideas whose time is probably almost imminent,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on the sidelines of the Edmonton summit. The researchers used trade and household data from 79 cities that are members of C40. Some 750 climate scientists and city planners from 80 countries are gathered in the western Canadian city to help chart a global roadmap for cities to battle climate change.
