2018-11-09,"Nov 9 (Reuters) - A liberal-leaning California-based federal appeals court that has often ruled against President Donald Trump dealt him another setback this week in a major immigration case and soon could be asked to weigh in on a pipeline project he has championed. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in San Francisco, has been a thorn in Trump’s side since he took office last year and has drawn the Republican president’s ire for its decisions in high-profile cases. His latest setback before the 9th Circuit came on Thursday when a three-judge panel rejected his bid to rescind a program launched by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, that protects from deportation hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants brought into the country as children. The 9th Circuit has handed him defeats on his travel ban targeting people from several Muslim-majority countries and his bid to withhold federal funds from so-called sanctuary cities that limit cooperation on immigration enforcement. It also is set to rule on the administration’s appeal of a judge’s order blocking Trump’s move to put restrictions on transgender people serving in the U.S. military. The 9th Circuit would hear any appeal by Trump’s administration of the ruling late on Thursday by a federal judge in Montana blocking construction for environmental reasons of the Keystone XL pipeline project that is designed to carry heavy crude oil from Canada to the United States. The Justice Department said on Friday it is reviewing the Keystone XL ruling to decide its next step. TransCanada Corp said it remains committed to building the $8 billion, 1,180-mile (1,900-km) pipeline. “The 9th Circuit is an easy punching bag for Trump because not only has it been traditionally liberal but California is its beating heart, and we all know how Trump fares in California,” said Barry McDonald, a law professor at Pepperdine University in Malibu. “He probably sees much of the West Coast as a nemesis for him.” California, the most populous U.S. state, is a liberal bastion that is unfriendly political territory for Trump. The president regularly belittles the 9th Circuit, as he did on Friday after the court’s ruling preserving the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. “The DACA will now hopefully go to the Supreme Court where it will be given a fair decision,” Trump told reporters. Trump already has appointed two justices to the nine-member Supreme Court, solidifying its 5-4 conservative majority. The 9th circuit has 16 judges who were appointed by Democratic presidents and seven who were named by Republican presidents. Democratic presidents tend to appoint more liberal jurists while Republican presidents favor more conservatives judges. It is one of the series of powerful regional federal appeals courts that are one step below the Supreme Court. These circuit courts often provide the last word in a legal dispute because the Supreme Court hears only a limited number of cases. The 9th Circuit hears appeals in federal cases spanning a huge region in terms of both geography and population, covering the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Trump already has named two judges to the 9th Circuit, with six other vacancies waiting to be filled. Trump will not be able to create a conservative majority on the 9th Circuit, however, without additional vacancies caused when actively presiding judges retire. Aided by fellow Republicans in the U.S. Senate, Trump has made it a top priority to rapidly appoint judges in a bid to make the federal judiciary more conservative. Trump has suggested his policies do not get a fair shake in the 9th Circuit and has touted the idea of breaking up that court. Trump last year decried the 9th Circuit’s “ridiculous” ruling on the travel ban, and said that court has “a terrible record of being overturned” by the Supreme Court - an often-made charge that the 9th Circuit’s chief judge took issue with in congressional testimony.

2018-11-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell nearly 1 percent on Friday as global supply increased and investors worried demand growth could slow, pressuring U.S. crude to its longest stretch of daily declines since 1984. Crude futures benchmarks have slid about 20 percent or more since peaking in early October. “What a difference a month makes,” said Michael Tran, commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “Market sentiment has shifted from the most bullish tone in years with many calling for $100 only weeks ago, to the weakest investor sentiment since the 2016 price trough.”  Benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell 47 cents, or 0.7 percent, to settle at $70.18 a barrel. During the session Brent fell below $70 a barrel for the first time since April, as much as 20 percent off four-year highs reached in October.  Brent slumped about 3.6 percent for the week and more than 15 percent this quarter. U.S. crude fell for the 10th straight day, the longest such streak since July 1984, according to Refinitiv data. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures CLc1 declined 48 cents, or 0.8 percent, to settle at $60.19 a barrel. The session low was an eight-month bottom at $59.26, down more than 22 percent from its October peak. That decline puts U.S. crude in “bear market” territory using a stock market definition.  Hedge funds cut bullish wagers on U.S. crude in the latest week to the lowest level in more than a year, data showed, while speculators slashed bullish bets on Brent crude to the lowest since July 2017. [CFTC/] Demand worries followed forecasts for slower economic growth in 2019, largely due to a U.S.-China trade war. [IEA/M] On Friday, Chinese data showed producer inflation fell in October for the fourth straight month on cooling domestic demand and manufacturing activity. The report sent global stocks into a tailspin. [MKTS/GLOB] Oil peaked in early October on the view that U.S. sanctions on Iran that came into force this week would drain global crude inventories and bring shortages in some regions. But other big producers have more than compensated for lost Iranian barrels. The United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia are pumping at or near record highs, producing more than 33 million barrels per day (bpd), a third of the world’s oil. U.S. energy firms added oil rigs for a fourth week in the last five, bringing the total count to 886, the highest since March 2015, data showed on Friday. Also, U.S. sanctions on Iran are unlikely to cut supply as much as expected. Washington has granted exemptions to Iran’s biggest buyers. A South Korean delegation including oil buyers is expected to head to Iran next week to discuss resuming oil imports after a three-month halt, sources told Reuters. China National Petroleum Corp said it was still taking oil from Iranian fields in which it has stakes. Bernstein Energy now expects “Iranian exports will average 1.4 million to 1.5 million bpd” during the exemption period, about half the volume in mid-2018. Inventories in Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. crude futures, have risen for seven straight weeks.  “As OPEC exports continue to rise, inventories continue to build, which is putting downward pressure on oil prices,” Bernstein said. “A slowdown in the global economy remains the key downside risk to oil.” Still, a return to oil production cuts by OPEC and its allies next year cannot be ruled out, two OPEC sources said this week.

2018-11-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks around the globe suffered their biggest drop in two weeks on Friday as weak Chinese economic data sapped demand for equities while oil prices weakened again on Friday.  U.S. stocks were broadly lower, with energy shares .SPNY  falling more than 1.0 percent as benchmark Brent crude oil saw a six-month low and U.S. crude fell below $60 for the first time since March.   Data from China added to the downward pressure, showing   factory-gate inflation slowed for the fourth month in October on cooling domestic demand and manufacturing activity.  Bad debts at Chinese brokers and banks are also causing concern. In the U.S., producer prices rose more than expected in October and at their fastest pace in six years, but measures of underlying price pressure cooled, bolstering the view that the U.S. central bank is not facing a resurgence in inflation. European shares dipped as mining and oil stocks sold off, but they managed to end the week with a small gain. “Oil is spooking the market. If oil prices are going to go lower that’s another sign that the global economy is going to slow its growth,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina. “It looks like a slow (stocks) sell off. All day long its been drifting lower.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 201.92 points, or 0.77 percent, to 25,989.3, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 25.82 points, or 0.92 percent, to 2,781.01 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 123.98 points, or 1.65 percent, to 7,406.90. Equities snapped a streak of seven straight days of gains on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve held interest rates steady but appeared to remain on track to raise its policy interest rate next month. The Federal Reserve decision disappointed some investors who had hoped that the sharp share price falls during what has been called “Red October” might have encouraged the U.S. central bank to take a more dovish approach toward monetary policy. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  lost 0.37 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 1.08 percent. The U.s. dollar, which had weakened sharply after Tuesday’s U.S. mid-term elections, was up for a second straight day and on track for a fourth straight week of gains.   Further dollar gains can pose headwinds for risky assets as that translates into tightening financial conditions as most emerging market economies borrow in dollars. A strong dollar could also hurt earnings of multinational U.S. corporations.  The dollar index .DXY rose 0.19 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.26 percent to $1.1333. The equity weakness pushed bond yields lower. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 12/32 in price to yield 3.1875 percent, from 3.232 percent late on Thursday. Oil prices fell to multi-month lows as global supply increased and investors worried about the possibility of slowing fuel demand, putting U.S. crude on track for the longest stretch of daily declines since 1984. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 settled down 0.79 percent at $60.19 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 settled at $70.18, down 0.67 percent on the day.

2018-11-09,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge in Montana has blocked construction of the Keystone XL pipeline designed to carry heavy crude oil from Canada to the United States, drawing praise on Friday from environmental groups and a rebuke from President Donald Trump. The ruling of a U.S. Court in Montana late on Thursday dealt a setback to TransCanada Corp (TRP.TO), whose stock fell 1.7 percent in Toronto. Shares of companies that would ship oil on the pipeline also slid.  TransCanada said in a statement it remains committed to building the $8 billion, 1,180 mile (1,900 km) pipeline, but it has also said it is seeking partners and has not taken a final investment decision.  The ruling drew an angry response from Trump, who approved the pipeline shortly after taking office.  It also piles pressure on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to assist the country’s ailing oil sector by accelerating crude shipments by rail until pipelines are built. Clogged pipelines have made discounts on Canadian oil even steeper than they were earlier this year when Scotiabank warned that they may cost the country’s economy C$16 billion. U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris wrote that a U.S. State Department environmental analysis of Keystone XL “fell short of a ‘hard look’” at the cumulative effects of greenhouse gas emissions and the impact on Native American land resources.  “It was a political decision made by a judge. I think it’s a disgrace,” Trump told reporters at the White House.  The ruling was a win for environmental groups who sued the U.S. government in 2017 after Trump announced a presidential permit for the project. Tribal groups and ranchers also have spent more than a decade fighting the planned pipeline. “The Trump administration tried to force this dirty pipeline project on the American people, but they can’t ignore the threats it would pose to our clean water, our climate, and our communities,” said the Sierra Club. The State Department is reviewing the judge’s order and had no comment due to ongoing litigation, a spokesman said. The pipeline would carry heavy crude from Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska, where it would connect to refineries in the U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast, as well as Gulf export terminals. Shares of Canadian oil producers Canadian Natural Resources Ltd (CNQ.TO) and Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO) lost 2.7 percent and 2.2 percent respectively.  Canada is the primary source of imported U.S. oil, but congested pipelines in Alberta, where tar-like bitumen is extracted, have forced oil shippers to use costlier rail and trucks.  Two pipeline projects have been scrapped due to opposition, and the Trans Mountain line project still faces delays even after the Canadian government purchased it this year to move it forward. “You have to wonder how long investors will tolerate the delays and whether the Canadian government will intervene again to protect the industry,” said Morningstar analyst Sandy Fielden. Ensuring at least one pipeline is built is critical to Trudeau’s plans, with a Canadian election expected next autumn. “I am disappointed in the court’s decision and I will be reaching out to TransCanada later on today to show our support to them and understand what the path forward is for them,” Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi told reporters in Edmonton, Alberta.  Alberta has felt the financial pressure, and an industry source said the provincial government last month solicited proposals from companies on ways to move crude faster by rail. The source said proposals included ideas such as buying rail cars and investing in loading terminals.  “I’ve never seen (the Alberta government) so active on this front,” said the source, who asked not to be identified because the matter is politically sensitive. “That is a shift.” Alberta Energy Minister Margaret McCuaig-Boyd said the province has sent a proposal to Ottawa to move crude faster by rail that includes making more tank cars available. “We’re giving away our resources cheap,” she told reporters. “We need market access.”    Neighboring Saskatchewan stands to lose C$500 million in annual royalties if the discount for Canadian crude remains steep, Saskatchewan Energy Minister Bronwyn Eyre said.  “People have placed quite a lot of hope in that (Keystone) project, so it’s a major setback,” she said in an interview. Morris, in his ruling, ordered the government to issue a more thorough environmental analysis before the project proceeds. He said the analysis failed to fully review the effects of the current oil price on the pipeline’s viability and did not fully model potential spills and offer mitigation measures. The ruling likely sets Keystone back by up to one year, said Dan Ripp, president of Bradley Woods Research.

2018-11-09,"NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. ethanol producers drew a bleak picture of their industry in quarterly filings and analyst calls this week, detailing how the critical farm belt business has been devastated by President Donald Trump’s trade war with China and biofuels management policies that they say have tilted toward oil refiners.     The ethanol business had grown for years at breakneck speed but its outlook has dimmed due to Washington’s aggressive protectionist stance and the administration’s unpredictable management of its renewable fuel program.     No. 4 U.S. ethanol producer Green Plains Inc reported a net loss of $12.5 million in the third quarter. The company has idled plants to trim soaring inventories and boost margins, it said Thursday. The company recently sold three plants and a vinegar business to help pay down debt.    CEO Todd Becker and others noted that China had been expected to import 200 million gallons of ethanol this year but has instead been out of the market for months due to Trump’s trade war. Becker said Chinese buying would wipe out the U.S. supply glut, which he estimated at about 120 million gallons. Archer Daniels Midland Co and Pacific Ethanol Inc, other big producers, also reported problems related to the trade fight. As recently as February, China was the No. 2 global market for U.S. ethanol, which consumes about a third of the domestic corn crop. Then Beijing boosted import tariffs on several high-value American agricultural goods including ethanol, soybeans and pork, pressuring prices for each.  U.S. ethanol futures  of $1.26 per gallon are near the lowest in more than a decade. Current stockpiles of 23.150 million barrels (972.3 million gallons) are just below a record from earlier this year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.     The ethanol industry “is in a negative margin position. I wouldn’t say there are many plants that would be positive, even our best plants,” Becker said.     Pacific Ethanol, the No. 6 U.S. ethanol producer, told investors last week that it idled 10 percent of its production capacity to battle high inventories and slumping margins. Its shares have sunk to less than $2 each. The economic run cuts will likely last into next year and may be expanded, Pacific Ethanol CEO Neil Koehler warned. “With China in the mix, it would be a very different market and margin environment today,” Koehler said in an earnings call. The Sacramento-based company recorded a loss of $7.5 million in the third quarter. It slashed its 2018 capital budget, deferred portions of debt payments and restructured loan terms to help preserve cash, according to its recent quarterly financial filing.   ADM CEO Juan Luciano, the No. 2 ethanol producer, said its carbohydrate division did well, with one exception: “The issue continues to be ethanol. And recently, we have seen people (taking) some capacity down, but probably still not enough,” Luciano told analysts. Other major ethanol producers, like Flint Hills Resources [FHR.UL] and top producer POET LLC, are privately held and do not release financial details. The ethanol industry’s view of Trump’s biofuels policy is a mixed bag. It has generally praised his recent decision to lift a summer ban of gasoline blended with 15 percent ethanol, or E15. That move could expand the domestic market for the corn-based fuel.  Still, ethanol producers have blasted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under Trump for granting waivers exempting a record number of refineries from federal ethanol blending requirements. Biofuel companies have complained that the move is an expensive political gift to the oil industry. “The truth is that the waivers capped domestic demand growth for ethanol and really hurt the industry,” said Geoff Cooper, head of the Renewable Fuels Associations. The ethanol industry and corn state lawmakers have urged the EPA to stop issuing the waivers and to compensate for lost ethanol blending volumes by requiring non-exempted refineries to blend even more. The EPA is in the process of finalizing its 2019 biofuels blending volumes requirements under the Renewable Fuel Standard, and is expected to unveil them by the end of the month.

2018-11-09,"Nov 9 (Reuters) - A liberal-leaning California-based federal appeals court that has often ruled against President Donald Trump dealt him another setback this week in a major immigration case and soon could be asked to weigh in on a pipeline project he has championed. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in San Francisco, has been a thorn in Trump’s side since he took office last year and has drawn the Republican president’s ire for its decisions in high-profile cases. His latest setback before the 9th Circuit came on Thursday when a three-judge panel rejected his bid to rescind a program launched by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, that protects from deportation hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants brought into the country as children. The 9th Circuit has handed him defeats on his travel ban targeting people from several Muslim-majority countries and his bid to withhold federal funds from so-called sanctuary cities that limit cooperation on immigration enforcement. It also is set to rule on the administration’s appeal of a judge’s order blocking Trump’s move to put restrictions on transgender people serving in the U.S. military. The 9th Circuit would hear any appeal by Trump’s administration of the ruling late on Thursday by a federal judge in Montana blocking construction for environmental reasons of the Keystone XL pipeline project that is designed to carry heavy crude oil from Canada to the United States. The Justice Department said on Friday it is reviewing the Keystone XL ruling to decide its next step. TransCanada Corp said it remains committed to building the $8 billion, 1,180-mile (1,900-km) pipeline. “The 9th Circuit is an easy punching bag for Trump because not only has it been traditionally liberal but California is its beating heart, and we all know how Trump fares in California,” said Barry McDonald, a law professor at Pepperdine University in Malibu. “He probably sees much of the West Coast as a nemesis for him.” California, the most populous U.S. state, is a liberal bastion that is unfriendly political territory for Trump. The president regularly belittles the 9th Circuit, as he did on Friday after the court’s ruling preserving the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. “The DACA will now hopefully go to the Supreme Court where it will be given a fair decision,” Trump told reporters. Trump already has appointed two justices to the nine-member Supreme Court, solidifying its 5-4 conservative majority. The 9th circuit has 16 judges who were appointed by Democratic presidents and seven who were named by Republican presidents. Democratic presidents tend to appoint more liberal jurists while Republican presidents favor more conservatives judges. It is one of the series of powerful regional federal appeals courts that are one step below the Supreme Court. These circuit courts often provide the last word in a legal dispute because the Supreme Court hears only a limited number of cases. The 9th Circuit hears appeals in federal cases spanning a huge region in terms of both geography and population, covering the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Trump already has named two judges to the 9th Circuit, with six other vacancies waiting to be filled. Trump will not be able to create a conservative majority on the 9th Circuit, however, without additional vacancies caused when actively presiding judges retire. Aided by fellow Republicans in the U.S. Senate, Trump has made it a top priority to rapidly appoint judges in a bid to make the federal judiciary more conservative. Trump has suggested his policies do not get a fair shake in the 9th Circuit and has touted the idea of breaking up that court. Trump last year decried the 9th Circuit’s “ridiculous” ruling on the travel ban, and said that court has “a terrible record of being overturned” by the Supreme Court - an often-made charge that the 9th Circuit’s chief judge took issue with in congressional testimony.

Crude futures benchmarks have slid about 20 percent or more since peaking in early October. “What a difference a month makes,” said Michael Tran, commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “Market sentiment has shifted from the most bullish tone in years with many calling for $100 only weeks ago, to the weakest investor sentiment since the 2016 price trough.”  Benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell 47 cents, or 0.7 percent, to settle at $70.18 a barrel. During the session Brent fell below $70 a barrel for the first time since April, as much as 20 percent off four-year highs reached in October.  Brent slumped about 3.6 percent for the week and more than 15 percent this quarter. U.S. crude fell for the 10th straight day, the longest such streak since July 1984, according to Refinitiv data. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures CLc1 declined 48 cents, or 0.8 percent, to settle at $60.19 a barrel. The session low was an eight-month bottom at $59.26, down more than 22 percent from its October peak. That decline puts U.S. crude in “bear market” territory using a stock market definition.  Hedge funds cut bullish wagers on U.S. crude in the latest week to the lowest level in more than a year, data showed, while speculators slashed bullish bets on Brent crude to the lowest since July 2017. [CFTC/] Demand worries followed forecasts for slower economic growth in 2019, largely due to a U.S.-China trade war. [IEA/M] On Friday, Chinese data showed producer inflation fell in October for the fourth straight month on cooling domestic demand and manufacturing activity. The report sent global stocks into a tailspin. [MKTS/GLOB] Oil peaked in early October on the view that U.S. sanctions on Iran that came into force this week would drain global crude inventories and bring shortages in some regions. But other big producers have more than compensated for lost Iranian barrels. The United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia are pumping at or near record highs, producing more than 33 million barrels per day (bpd), a third of the world’s oil. U.S. energy firms added oil rigs for a fourth week in the last five, bringing the total count to 886, the highest since March 2015, data showed on Friday. Also, U.S. sanctions on Iran are unlikely to cut supply as much as expected. Washington has granted exemptions to Iran’s biggest buyers. A South Korean delegation including oil buyers is expected to head to Iran next week to discuss resuming oil imports after a three-month halt, sources told Reuters. China National Petroleum Corp said it was still taking oil from Iranian fields in which it has stakes. Bernstein Energy now expects “Iranian exports will average 1.4 million to 1.5 million bpd” during the exemption period, about half the volume in mid-2018. Inventories in Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. crude futures, have risen for seven straight weeks.  “As OPEC exports continue to rise, inventories continue to build, which is putting downward pressure on oil prices,” Bernstein said. “A slowdown in the global economy remains the key downside risk to oil.” Still, a return to oil production cuts by OPEC and its allies next year cannot be ruled out, two OPEC sources said this week.

2018-11-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks around the globe suffered their biggest drop in two weeks on Friday as weak Chinese economic data sapped demand for equities while oil prices weakened again on Friday.  U.S. stocks were broadly lower, with energy shares .SPNY  falling more than 1.0 percent as benchmark Brent crude oil saw a six-month low and U.S. crude fell below $60 for the first time since March.   Data from China added to the downward pressure, showing   factory-gate inflation slowed for the fourth month in October on cooling domestic demand and manufacturing activity.  Bad debts at Chinese brokers and banks are also causing concern. In the U.S., producer prices rose more than expected in October and at their fastest pace in six years, but measures of underlying price pressure cooled, bolstering the view that the U.S. central bank is not facing a resurgence in inflation. European shares dipped as mining and oil stocks sold off, but they managed to end the week with a small gain. “Oil is spooking the market. If oil prices are going to go lower that’s another sign that the global economy is going to slow its growth,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina. “It looks like a slow (stocks) sell off. All day long its been drifting lower.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 201.92 points, or 0.77 percent, to 25,989.3, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 25.82 points, or 0.92 percent, to 2,781.01 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 123.98 points, or 1.65 percent, to 7,406.90. Equities snapped a streak of seven straight days of gains on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve held interest rates steady but appeared to remain on track to raise its policy interest rate next month. The Federal Reserve decision disappointed some investors who had hoped that the sharp share price falls during what has been called “Red October” might have encouraged the U.S. central bank to take a more dovish approach toward monetary policy. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  lost 0.37 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 1.08 percent. The U.s. dollar, which had weakened sharply after Tuesday’s U.S. mid-term elections, was up for a second straight day and on track for a fourth straight week of gains.   Further dollar gains can pose headwinds for risky assets as that translates into tightening financial conditions as most emerging market economies borrow in dollars. A strong dollar could also hurt earnings of multinational U.S. corporations.  The dollar index .DXY rose 0.19 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.26 percent to $1.1333. The equity weakness pushed bond yields lower. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 12/32 in price to yield 3.1875 percent, from 3.232 percent late on Thursday. Oil prices fell to multi-month lows as global supply increased and investors worried about the possibility of slowing fuel demand, putting U.S. crude on track for the longest stretch of daily declines since 1984. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 settled down 0.79 percent at $60.19 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 settled at $70.18, down 0.67 percent on the day.

2018-11-09,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge in Montana has blocked construction of the Keystone XL pipeline designed to carry heavy crude oil from Canada to the United States, drawing praise on Friday from environmental groups and a rebuke from President Donald Trump. The ruling of a U.S. Court in Montana late on Thursday dealt a setback to TransCanada Corp (TRP.TO), whose stock fell 1.7 percent in Toronto. Shares of companies that would ship oil on the pipeline also slid.  TransCanada said in a statement it remains committed to building the $8 billion, 1,180 mile (1,900 km) pipeline, but it has also said it is seeking partners and has not taken a final investment decision.  The ruling drew an angry response from Trump, who approved the pipeline shortly after taking office.  It also piles pressure on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to assist the country’s ailing oil sector by accelerating crude shipments by rail until pipelines are built. Clogged pipelines have made discounts on Canadian oil even steeper than they were earlier this year when Scotiabank warned that they may cost the country’s economy C$16 billion. U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris wrote that a U.S. State Department environmental analysis of Keystone XL “fell short of a ‘hard look’” at the cumulative effects of greenhouse gas emissions and the impact on Native American land resources.  “It was a political decision made by a judge. I think it’s a disgrace,” Trump told reporters at the White House.  The ruling was a win for environmental groups who sued the U.S. government in 2017 after Trump announced a presidential permit for the project. Tribal groups and ranchers also have spent more than a decade fighting the planned pipeline. “The Trump administration tried to force this dirty pipeline project on the American people, but they can’t ignore the threats it would pose to our clean water, our climate, and our communities,” said the Sierra Club. The State Department is reviewing the judge’s order and had no comment due to ongoing litigation, a spokesman said. The pipeline would carry heavy crude from Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska, where it would connect to refineries in the U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast, as well as Gulf export terminals. Shares of Canadian oil producers Canadian Natural Resources Ltd (CNQ.TO) and Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO) lost 2.7 percent and 2.2 percent respectively.  Canada is the primary source of imported U.S. oil, but congested pipelines in Alberta, where tar-like bitumen is extracted, have forced oil shippers to use costlier rail and trucks.  Two pipeline projects have been scrapped due to opposition, and the Trans Mountain line project still faces delays even after the Canadian government purchased it this year to move it forward. “You have to wonder how long investors will tolerate the delays and whether the Canadian government will intervene again to protect the industry,” said Morningstar analyst Sandy Fielden. Ensuring at least one pipeline is built is critical to Trudeau’s plans, with a Canadian election expected next autumn. “I am disappointed in the court’s decision and I will be reaching out to TransCanada later on today to show our support to them and understand what the path forward is for them,” Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi told reporters in Edmonton, Alberta.  Alberta has felt the financial pressure, and an industry source said the provincial government last month solicited proposals from companies on ways to move crude faster by rail. The source said proposals included ideas such as buying rail cars and investing in loading terminals.  “I’ve never seen (the Alberta government) so active on this front,” said the source, who asked not to be identified because the matter is politically sensitive. “That is a shift.” Alberta Energy Minister Margaret McCuaig-Boyd said the province has sent a proposal to Ottawa to move crude faster by rail that includes making more tank cars available. “We’re giving away our resources cheap,” she told reporters. “We need market access.”    Neighboring Saskatchewan stands to lose C$500 million in annual royalties if the discount for Canadian crude remains steep, Saskatchewan Energy Minister Bronwyn Eyre said.  “People have placed quite a lot of hope in that (Keystone) project, so it’s a major setback,” she said in an interview. Morris, in his ruling, ordered the government to issue a more thorough environmental analysis before the project proceeds. He said the analysis failed to fully review the effects of the current oil price on the pipeline’s viability and did not fully model potential spills and offer mitigation measures. The ruling likely sets Keystone back by up to one year, said Dan Ripp, president of Bradley Woods Research.

2018-11-09,"NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. ethanol producers drew a bleak picture of their industry in quarterly filings and analyst calls this week, detailing how the critical farm belt business has been devastated by President Donald Trump’s trade war with China and biofuels management policies that they say have tilted toward oil refiners.     The ethanol business had grown for years at breakneck speed but its outlook has dimmed due to Washington’s aggressive protectionist stance and the administration’s unpredictable management of its renewable fuel program.     No. 4 U.S. ethanol producer Green Plains Inc reported a net loss of $12.5 million in the third quarter. The company has idled plants to trim soaring inventories and boost margins, it said Thursday. The company recently sold three plants and a vinegar business to help pay down debt.    CEO Todd Becker and others noted that China had been expected to import 200 million gallons of ethanol this year but has instead been out of the market for months due to Trump’s trade war. Becker said Chinese buying would wipe out the U.S. supply glut, which he estimated at about 120 million gallons. Archer Daniels Midland Co and Pacific Ethanol Inc, other big producers, also reported problems related to the trade fight. As recently as February, China was the No. 2 global market for U.S. ethanol, which consumes about a third of the domestic corn crop. Then Beijing boosted import tariffs on several high-value American agricultural goods including ethanol, soybeans and pork, pressuring prices for each.  U.S. ethanol futures  of $1.26 per gallon are near the lowest in more than a decade. Current stockpiles of 23.150 million barrels (972.3 million gallons) are just below a record from earlier this year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.     The ethanol industry “is in a negative margin position. I wouldn’t say there are many plants that would be positive, even our best plants,” Becker said.     Pacific Ethanol, the No. 6 U.S. ethanol producer, told investors last week that it idled 10 percent of its production capacity to battle high inventories and slumping margins. Its shares have sunk to less than $2 each. The economic run cuts will likely last into next year and may be expanded, Pacific Ethanol CEO Neil Koehler warned. “With China in the mix, it would be a very different market and margin environment today,” Koehler said in an earnings call. The Sacramento-based company recorded a loss of $7.5 million in the third quarter. It slashed its 2018 capital budget, deferred portions of debt payments and restructured loan terms to help preserve cash, according to its recent quarterly financial filing.   ADM CEO Juan Luciano, the No. 2 ethanol producer, said its carbohydrate division did well, with one exception: “The issue continues to be ethanol. And recently, we have seen people (taking) some capacity down, but probably still not enough,” Luciano told analysts. Other major ethanol producers, like Flint Hills Resources [FHR.UL] and top producer POET LLC, are privately held and do not release financial details. The ethanol industry’s view of Trump’s biofuels policy is a mixed bag. It has generally praised his recent decision to lift a summer ban of gasoline blended with 15 percent ethanol, or E15. That move could expand the domestic market for the corn-based fuel.  Still, ethanol producers have blasted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under Trump for granting waivers exempting a record number of refineries from federal ethanol blending requirements. Biofuel companies have complained that the move is an expensive political gift to the oil industry. “The truth is that the waivers capped domestic demand growth for ethanol and really hurt the industry,” said Geoff Cooper, head of the Renewable Fuels Associations. The ethanol industry and corn state lawmakers have urged the EPA to stop issuing the waivers and to compensate for lost ethanol blending volumes by requiring non-exempted refineries to blend even more. The EPA is in the process of finalizing its 2019 biofuels blending volumes requirements under the Renewable Fuel Standard, and is expected to unveil them by the end of the month.

2018-11-09,"ZAGREB, Nov 9 (Reuters) - State-owned LNG Croatia on Friday picked Golar Power Ltd as the best bidder to deliver a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) for a planned European Union-backed liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in the northern Adriatic. Golar Power was picked from three bidders, including Mitsui O.S.K. Lines and Maran Gas Maritime Inc, LNG Croatia, the company behind the project, said in a statement. It said Golar Power, a joint venture between Golar LNG Ltd and Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners, offered to convert the existing LNG carrier to an FSRU at a cost of 159.6 million euros ($180.8 million). The selected FSRU vessel has LNG storage capacity of 140,000 cubic metres, with a nominal LNG regasification capacity of 300,000 cubic metres of natural gas per hour, giving an annual capacity of 2.6 billion cubic metres of gas, it added. In September, Croatia again extended a deadline - this time to Dec. 20 - for submitting binding bids to use the terminal, planned as part of the EU’s efforts to diversify from Russian energy imports. The targeted markets are countries in central and southeastern Europe. The total cost of the terminal is seen at 250 million euros, with the EU financing just over 120 million. The capacity of the terminal, which has a tentative date for operation from January 2021, will eventually depend on demand, said LNG Croatia. The unsuccessful bidders can appeal the decision by Nov. 15, the company added. $1 = 0.8828 euros

2018-11-09,"(Reuters) - U.S. energy firms added oil rigs for a fourth time in the last five, keeping the rig count at its highest in over three years even though crude futures were on track to fall for a fifth week in a row to their lowest level since February. Drillers added 12 oil rigs in the week to Nov. 9, bringing the total count to 886, the highest level since March 2015, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI That was the biggest weekly increase since late May when drillers added 15 rigs. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 738 rigs were active because energy companies have ramped up production to capture prices that are higher in 2018 than 2017. More than half the total U.S. oil rigs are in the Permian Basin, the country’s biggest shale oil formation. Active units there increased by five this week to 492, the most since January 2015. On Friday, U.S. crude futures were trading around $60 per barrel, their lowest in over eight months, as global supply increased and investors worried about the impact on fuel demand of lower economic growth and trade disputes.

Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks expect to spend a total of $89.6 billion in 2018. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017. Cowen said early 2019 capital spending budgets were mixed, with some companies such as Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) and Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) expecting to add to capital spending next year, while others like Abraxas Petroleum Corp (AXAS.O) expect to reduce spending next year.  Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Since 1,081 oil and gas rigs are already in service, drillers do not have to add any rigs for the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. Year-to-date, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,025. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas.

2018-11-09,"* Stocks set for biggest drop in two weeks * Oil slump continues * U.S. dollar edges up (Updates with open of U.S. markets, changes byline, dateline; previous LONDON) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Global stocks were on pace for their biggest drop in two weeks while oil prices weakened again on Friday and soft Chinese data hit demand for risky assets. U.S. stocks were broadly lower, with energy shares falling more than 1 percent as benchmark Brent crude touched a six-month low and U.S. crude fell below $60 for the first time since March after entering a bear market on Thursday. “Everybody is starting to look at oil with a nervous eye, it’s probably too early to make any claims about oil falling because of demand versus supply but when you fall from $75 to $60 it all of a sudden makes people interested in what is going on in oil,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. Adding to pressure was data from China, which showed factory-gate inflation slowed for the fourth month in October on cooling domestic demand and manufacturing activity. On the U.S. side, producer prices rose more than expected in October and at their fastest pace in six years but measures of underlying price pressure cooled, bolstering the view that the U.S. central bank is not facing a resurgence in inflation. “China always is lurking in the background, they have been on the struggle bus all year and they are still on the struggle bus,” said Antonelli. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 189.2 points, or 0.72 percent, to 26,002.02, the S&P 500 lost 24.53 points, or 0.87 percent, to 2,782.3 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 114.76 points, or 1.52 percent, to 7,416.13. World equities snapped a streak of seven straight days of gains on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve held interest rates steady but appeared to remain on track to raise its key interest rate next month. Some investors had hoped that the sharp share price falls during what has been called “Red October” might have encouraged the U.S. central bank to take a more dovish approach towards monetary policy. European shares were also hit by the prospect of Fed’s interest rate rises in the face of a global economy that has shown signs of slowing, apart from the United States. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.42 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.05 percent. The dollar, which had weakened sharply after mid-term elections, was on track to rise for its second straight day and was poised for a fourth straight week of gains. Further dollar gains can pose headwinds for global risky assets as that translates into tightening financial conditions as most emerging market economies borrow in dollars. A strong dollar could also hurt earnings of multinational U.S. corporations. The dollar index rose 0.13 percent, with the euro down 0.2 percent to $1.1339. The equity weakness pushed bond yields lower. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 11/32 in price to yield 3.1911 percent, from 3.232 percent late on Thursday. Oil prices fell to multi-month lows as global supply increased and investors worried about the impact on fuel demand of lower economic growth and trade disputes. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.77 percent to $60.20 per barrel and Brent was last at $70.07, down 0.82 percent on the day. Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak

2018-11-09,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Nov 9 (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge in Montana halted construction of TransCanada Corp’s Keystone XL oil pipeline on Thursday, saying a U.S. environmental analysis “fell short of a ‘hard look’” at the cumulative effects of greenhouse gas emissions and the impact on Native American land resources. The ruling is the latest delay to the project, a decade in planning, which was revived by U.S. President Donald Trump after being halted by his predecessor, Barack Obama. KXL, as it is known, is a proposed $8 billion, 1,180 mile (1,900 km) pipeline that would carry heavy crude to Steele City, Nebraska, from Canada’s oil sands in Alberta. Planned by Canada’s TransCanada, KXL would provide a shortcut to carry more Canadian oil to U.S. markets, complementing the existing Keystone line than runs from Alberta to Steele City and then Gulf Coast refineries. Crude production in Alberta’s oil sands is expanding faster than pipeline capacity, creating a bottleneck that has driven down prices. Canada’s heavy crude now fetches a fraction of the benchmark U.S. light oil price, and some producers have curtailed production. The steep discount has stripped billions of dollars from the Canadian economy by some estimates. Environmental groups have campaigned against pipelines to carry crude from Canada’s oil sands, saying extraction methods used in the region harm the environment more than conventional oil drilling. In Nebraska, landowners blasted what they saw as heavy-handed efforts by TransCanada to force the pipe through ecologically sensitive areas. Obama, a Democrat, axed the project in 2015, saying Canada would reap most of the economic benefits while the project would add to greenhouse gas emissions. President Donald Trump, a Republican, pushed to approve KXL soon after he took office, saying it would create U.S. jobs. In 2017, a presidential permit allowed the line to move forward, and several environmental groups sued the U.S. government. The Nebraska Public Service Commission issued an approval late last year for an alternative route, a ruling that environmental groups are challenging. In Washington, the judge’s ruling on Thursday was a blow to Trump, who critics say is trying to force an unpopular project on the American people. In Ottawa, pressure is mounting on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to get a pipeline built to help Canadian producers sell their oil at higher prices while building support for other steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions before an election expected next year. In summer, Trudeau’s government bought the floundering Trans Mountain pipeline project, hoping to get it built. U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris ordered the federal government to conduct a more thorough environmental analysis. Separately, TransCanada has said it expects a decision on routing from the Nebraska Supreme Court by the first quarter of 2019. TransCanada has yet to make a final investment decision to proceed with the project, even though it had started construction. It said last week that it is also seeking partners to finance KXL’s construction.

2018-11-09,"* OMV to pay $540 mln for 50 pct in upstream JV * Will manage refinancing of $350 mln debt * Further payments, up to $85 mln, depend on value enhancement (Recasts, writes through) By Kirsti Knolle VIENNA, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Austrian oil and gas group OMV has agreed on a joint venture with Malaysia’s Sapura Energy, paying $540 million for a 50 percent stake in its exploration assets, aiming to use it as a springboard for further expansion in Asia. OMV has declared Southeast Asia a new core market in its strategy of expanding in low-cost countries outside Europe, with a particular focus on meeting demand for natural gas because of its lower CO2 emissions compared with oil. “This acquisition is a great strategic fit for OMV,” Chief Executive Rainer Seele said in an investor call on Friday, adding that it gives the company access to a market where demand for gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) is expected to grow by 50 percent by 2030. The deal involves Sapura Upstream being transferred to a new business to be called SEB Upstream (SUP), in which OMV will buy a 50 percent stake. Sapura Upstream’s network and its strong relationship with Malaysia’s state energy giant Petroliam Nasional(Petronas) will also help OMV to expand in the region, Seele said. “Petronas ... is a JV partner in all domestic assets of Sapura Upstream,” he said. In addition to the $540 million purchase price, OMV agreed to a further payment of up to $85 million, dependent on the commercial success of an oil asset in Mexico and the Brent crude benchmark oil price, Sapura Energy said in a statement. SUP will also have to repay a $350 million loan from Sapura Energy in cash, either through a loan from OMV or bank borrowing secured by SUP, the Malaysian company said. Seele plans to manage refinancing of the $350 million via an intercompany loan. “As we are going to fully consolidate Sapura Upstream, it has no impact on our cash flow, no visible impact on our debt and on our gearing,” he said. OMV has set aside 10 billion euros for acquisitions up to 2025. It has now used about 2.5 billion euros of that, having expanded this year in New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates to balance geopolitical risks it faces in countries such as Russia, Libya and Yemen. The Austrian group plans to produce 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day in Southeast Asia by 2023, it has said previously. Sapura’s upstream production currently stands at about 10,000 boe per day (boe/d) and will reach 60,000 boe/d after 2023, Seele said, adding that much of the output will be transported to the world’s third-largest LNG complex, majority owned and operated by Petronas. LNG, which has become the fastest growing traded commodity, fetches higher prices in Asia than in Europe, he said.

2018-11-09,"HOUSTON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Some of the biggest pipeline operators in the United States have supercharged earnings this year by buying deeply discounted shale in West Texas oilfields and selling it at a premium at Gulf Coast ports. These companies are taking advantage of extraordinary markdowns in West Texas where surging production and a lack of pipeline space sent the regional price for oil in late August $23 per barrel below the coastal price in Houston. Record profits illustrate the divide between the haves - those with guaranteed pipeline space - and the have nots, producers that must sell oil at the wellhead. Production in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico is projected to hit 3.55 million barrels per day (bpd), up from 2.04 million bpd two years ago. The biggest beneficiary: Occidental Petroleum Corp, which last quarter earned $796 million from its marketing and logistics arm, excluding asset sales, compared with $4 million in the same period last year. That profit was nearly four times what the Houston-based company made last quarter pumping oil in the United States. Plains All American Pipeline also got a boost from buying cheap at the wellhead and collecting the U.S. Gulf Coast price. Its business that buys and resells oil earned $75 million last quarter compared with a loss of $56 million a year ago. “We were able to catch additional crude differentials, primarily around the Permian,” Chief Executive Willie Chiang told investors this week. He expects the discount to continue through next year when its and others’ new Gulf Coast pipelines begin full operation. Energy Transfer, operator of the Permian Express pipeline, credited “more favorable market price differentials between the West Texas and Gulf Coast markets” last quarter for lifting its profit by $108 million over a year earlier. The difference also is filling crude pipelines at companies that only transport and store oil for a fee. Magellan Midstream Partners LP credited strong volumes from the Permian Basin of West Texas for record crude oil earnings last quarter. The Houston firm collected $4 per barrel on increased spot shipments, twice that of its contract volumes, as shippers reacted to the wide spread between crude prices in the Permian Basin and Houston, spokesman Bruce Heine said on Friday. The Midland-to-Houston crude differential has narrowed to around $10 this week as Plains began transporting additional crude from its expanded Sunrise pipeline from the Permian to Cushing, Oklahoma.

2018-11-09,"(Reuters) - The United States on Monday re-imposed sanctions against Iran’s oil exports to punish Tehran for its involvement in several Middle Eastern conflicts. Washington had been pushing governments to cut imports of Iranian oil to zero. But, fearing a price spike, it granted Iran’s biggest buyers - China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey - sanctions waivers. That will allow the eight, which account for about 75 percent of all Iran’s oil exports, according to trade data, to import at least some oil for another 180 days. Washington and the recipients of the waivers with the exception of Turkey have not disclosed how much oil they are allowed to import, or under what conditions deals can still be made. Bernstein Energy expects “Iranian exports will average 1.4-1.5 million barrels per day (bpd)” during the exemption period,” down from a peak of almost 3 million bpd in mid-2018. J.P. Morgan said “the lack or difficulty in acquiring shipping insurance will help in reducing exports quickly as they did during last international sanctions.” The U.S. bank also said “payments for the oil by the exempt countries must go into escrow accounts in their local currency” and that this “means the money won’t directly go to Iran and it can only be used to buy certain non-sanctioned goods from its crude export customers.” Once the waivers expire after 180 days, new waivers are expected to be issued, with a source in China saying his country would likely receive another six months of exemptions, though at a lower rate of around 220,000 bpd. China, the world’s biggest importer of crude oil, is also the top buyer of Iranian oil, and its mostly state-owned refiners have lobbied hard for waivers. Several Chinese sources with knowledge of the matter said China would be allowed to buy 360,000 bpd of Iranian crude during the exemption period of 180 days. That would be about half the daily average China has been importing from Iran since January 2016, trade data showed. However, one source said the United States had attached strings to the waivers, including counterparty disclosures and laying open settlement methods, which were being evaluated before placing new orders with Iran. Meanwhile, China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) is still taking oil from Iranian fields in which CNPC has ownership stakes, according to a company executive. Oil that Chinese companies have access to as part of their assets in Iran does not fall under the volumes China is allowed to import under the waiver, he said. India is the world’s third-biggest oil importer. India is also Iran’s second-biggest oil customer and will be one of the most exposed to a forced drop in supply because of its relative proximity to Iran. One Indian source close to the country’s refining sector said India would likely be allowed to import around 300,000 bpd of Iranian crude during the exemption period compared with normal volumes of around 450,000 to 550,000 bpd. South Korea is a large buyer of Iranian condensate, a super light form of crude oil, used by its large petrochemical industry. A close U.S. ally, South Korea had stopped buying crude from Iran ahead of the sanctions while still lobbying for exemptions. This week, reports emerged that South Korea received a waiver allowing it to import around 4 million barrels a month, equal to about 130,000 bpd, of Iranian crude and condensate. South Korea has averaged over 200,000 bpd of oil imports from Iran so far this year, down from around 350,000 bpd in 2017. Banking sources said any Korean payments for Iranian oil would need to be made in its won currency. The won-denominated payments will go into escrow accounts handled by the Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) and Woori Bank. Officials from both banks said, however, that won-denominated payments for Iranian oil were still being reviewed, and that no schedule a for resumption was set yet. Japan, another key Asian U.S. ally, also ceased Iranian oil imports prior to the sanctions, but has received a waiver to import an undisclosed amount of oil from Iran in the next 180 days. Japan’s trade minister, Hiroshige Seko, said on Tuesday that Japanese buyers were expected to resume imports from the Islamic Republic again soon. Refining sources in Japan, however, said they first needed to evaluated the conditions attached to the waivers, with no new orders likely before December. Taiwan is only an occasional importer of Iranian oil, and no details regarding its waivers have been disclosed. Italy and Turkey have been importing around 200,000 bpd of oil from Iran over the past two years, with Greece importing less than 100,000 bpd. Italy and Greece have completely suspended purchases in recent weeks. The waivers for those countries took the market by surprise and trading sources have said they are now evaluating prospects for resuming some imports. Turkey’s Energy Minister Fatih Donmez said on Friday it had been granted a waiver to import 3 million tonnes a year of Iranian oil, or about 60,000 bpd. On Tuesday, Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan said the country would not abide by the sanctions as they were aimed at “unbalancing the world”.

2018-11-09,"By Brendan O’Brien and David Gaffen Nov 9 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge in Montana late Thursday halted construction of the Keystone XL pipeline that would carry heavy crude oil from Canada to the United States, throwing another obstacle in the path of the project that has been in development for a decade. The ruling dealt a major setback to TransCanada Corp and could delay the construction of the $8 billion, 1,180 mile (1,900 km) pipeline. It was also a blow to U.S. President Donald Trump, who approved the line shortly after taking office in 2017 as part of his plan to boost U.S. energy infrastructure. A TransCanada spokesperson could not be immediately reached for comment. The ruling is a victory for environmentalists, tribal groups and ranchers who have spent more than a decade fighting against construction of the pipeline that will carry heavy crude from Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska. From there, it would connect to key refining points in the U.S. Midwest and U.S. Gulf Coast, as well as export terminals in the Gulf. U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris ruled late Thursday that the U.S. government did not complete a full analysis of the environmental impact of the project. His ruling came after a lawsuit was filed by several environmental groups against the U.S. government in 2017, soon after Trump announced a presidential permit for the project. Morris wrote in his ruling that a U.S. State Department environmental analysis “fell short of a ‘hard look’” at the cumulative effects of greenhouse gas emissions and the impact on Native American land resources. State Department officials were not immediately available for comment. In Thursday’s ruling, Morris ordered the government to issue a more thorough environmental analysis before the project could move forward. Canada has long sought more arteries to move oil out of the province of Alberta, where the heavy, tar-like bitumen is extracted. Several projects have already been scrapped, and the Canadian government had to take ownership of another project - an expansion of the Trans Mountain line - to move it forward. But that project is facing delays in Canada. “It means more delay for TransCanada,” said Sandy Fielden, an analyst at Morningstar. “You have to wonder how long investors will tolerate the delays and whether the Canadian government will intervene again to protect the industry.” The United States is the biggest importer of Canadian crude, but full pipelines have forced shippers to rely more heavily on less efficient transportation methods, including railroad, and in some cases, trucks to deliver oil to U.S. pipeline injection points. “The Trump administration tried to force this dirty pipeline project on the American people, but they can’t ignore the threats it would pose to our clean water, our climate, and our communities,” said the Sierra Club, one of the environmental groups involved in the lawsuit. Morris said in his ruling the analysis failed to fully review the effects of the current oil price on the pipeline’s viability and did not fully model potential oil spills and offer mitigations measures. Former President Barack Obama rejected the pipeline in 2015, citing environmental concerns related to emissions that cause climate change.

2018-11-09,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A subsea power line set to link the networks of Denmark and the Netherlands reached the Dutch coast on Friday as part of plans to share excess electricity from wind farms and other sources. The 325 km (202 mile) long COBRAcable, short for Copenhagen, Brussels and Amsterdam, has a capacity of around 700 megawatts (MW) and is expected to become fully operational in the third quarter of 2019. “This is an important step towards the integration of electricity networks in western Europe”, said Jeroen Brouwers, spokesman for Dutch grid operator TenneT.  “We will now have the first link between the Netherlands and Denmark, adding to existing connections with Norway and Britain.”  TenneT and Danish counterpart Energinet.dk have invested 621 million euros ($705 million) in the project, supported by a 86 million euro subsidy from the European Commission as part of efforts to build a European electricity network. The link will run from Endrup in Denmark to Eemshaven in the Netherlands when completed. Rapid growth in renewable energy generation including wind and solar has increased the need for better interconnections between countries, prompting grid operators across Europe to invest in new cross-border lines. Wind turbines already supply around half of the total electricity needed in Denmark, but last year delivered only around 2 percent of all energy in The Netherlands. The Dutch plan to build wind farms with a capacity of up to 11,000 MW in its part of the North Sea in the next decade.  “The Dutch will by then have passed the Danes with their capacity in wind energy,” Brouwers said.  “This network will guarantee the efficient use of all that energy, by making it possible to import and export abundant electricity.” Reporting by Bart Meijer; editing by Jason Neely",https://uk.reuters.com/article/netherlands-denmark-energy/denmark-netherlands-subsea-power-cable-reaches-dutch-coast-idUKL8N1XK4Z7,09 Nov 2018,"A subsea power line set to link

2018-11-09,"(Repeats with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Nov 9 (Reuters) - China’s record imports of crude oil in October are without a doubt a bullish outcome, but within the broader pattern of growing demand there were some temporary factors lifting purchases. China imported 40.8 million tonnes of crude in October, equivalent to 9.61 million barrels per day (bpd), a figure that beat the previous record of 9.60 million bpd from April. Imports jumped a massive 31.5 percent from the same month a year earlier, and also by 9.6 percent from September, according to customs data. It’s probably worth trying to split the underlying trend in China’s oil imports from the short-term factors that can cause outcomes such as October’s record. The Chinese oil import story is still one of strength, with economic growth, falling domestic output and the ongoing strategic storage buildup all contributing. For the first 10 months of the year, China, the world’s biggest crude buyer, imported 9.06 million bpd, a gain of 8.1 percent over the same period in 2017. None of the three factors driving China’s underlying import growth show any sign of changing dramatically in the short to medium term. Even though China’s economic growth has softened slightly as the United States imposes trade tariffs, it’s likely that stimulus measures will help to keep gross domestic product expanding at a rate above 6 percent. It’s also likely that China’s domestic oil production will continue its gentle slide, as shown by the 1.9 percent drop to 3.77 million bpd in the first three quarters of the year compared to the same period a year earlier. China is also still some way from completing its goal of holding reserves equivalent to 90 days of import cover, with the International Energy Agency estimating it held 287 million barrels at the end of 2017. China doesn’t disclose how much crude it is directing into its strategic reserves, although various energy analysts believe it is in the region of 100,000 bpd. Against this backdrop of solid underlying demand growth, October added a couple of factors that are unlikely to be permanent. The first is that smaller, independent refiners were active in the month, buying almost 2 million bpd, which is a record high, according to data from Refinitiv Oil Research and Forecasts. The independents were likely buying crude to use up their import quotas before they expired, raising the possibility that demand from this sector will moderate a touch in coming months. There also seemed to be a bit of rush to buy Iranian crude before the Nov. 4 resumption of U.S. sanctions against the Islamic Republic’s exports. Imports from Iran were 654,000 bpd in October, according to Refinitiv data, which was 43 percent higher than September’s 458,000 bpd. The above numbers come with a caveat insofar as it’s becoming harder to track Iranian exports as the country’s tankers have started disabling their vessel-monitoring systems. It may have been the case that Chinese importers were stocking up on Iranian crude ahead of the renewed U.S. sanctions. This raises the possibility that China may wind back purchases in coming months, especially since the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump decided to grant waivers to eight buyers of Iranian crude, including top purchasers China and India, for a period of six months. It’s also worth noting that China’s exports of refined products were only slightly weaker in October than in September, with 4 million tonnes being shipped, down from 4.06 million. This equates to about 1.03 million bpd of product exports, with Chinese refiners likely to be keen to sell into the strong regional market for middle distillates such as diesel and jet fuel, where the profit margins are at, or close to, four-year highs. China’s product exports are up 19.4 percent in the first 10 months of the year, compared to the same period last year. Overall, the picture that emerges is that China’s appetite for imported crude oil remains strong and growing, and October’s record, while boosted by temporary factors, is unlikely to last for too long given the robust fundamentals.

While the decision to hold interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve was anticipated by markets, some participants had expected a more cautious approach from the central bank after a stock market rout in October. “That the Fed indicated an optimistic view on the economy despite the turbulence in stock markets in October suggests more rate hikes are in store and that is not positive for risky assets,” said Lefteris Farmakis, a strategist at UBS in London. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe fell half a percent, its biggest drop since Oct. 26, as the Fed indicated that another rate increase is likely in December. U.S. stock index futures are down 0.5 percent. Rick Rieder, co-manager of the BlackRock fixed income global opportunities fund, said likely greater tightening in financial conditions could start affecting other sectors of the U.S. economy such as autos and small businesses. European stocks were a sea of red. MSCI’s main European index was down nearly 1 percent and the broader Euro STOXX 600 fell 0.7 percent. Stocks in Hong Kong and China were the main losers in Asia, where a financial sector sub-index fell more than two percent after China’s banking watchdog told lenders to allocate at least a third of new loans to private companies, raising the prospects of a jump in bad assets. A confident Fed also gave a boost to the dollar, which had weakened sharply after mid-term elections this week raised the prospects of U.S. political gridlock. Friday’s rise puts the greenback on track for a fourth consecutive week of gains. The greenback gained a quarter of a percent against the euro and half a percent against the British pound. Further dollar gains can also pose headwinds for global risky assets as that translates into tightening global financial conditions as most emerging market economies borrow in dollars. The dollar index measuring the currency against its six major rivals gained 0.25 percent to 96.86. Losses in equities pressured bond yields lower, with safe-haven benchmark debt in Germany and the United States softening across the board, pressured by world trade frictions and a budget standoff between Italy and Brussels. Oil prices fell to multi-month lows as global supply increased and investors worried about the impact on fuel demand from of lower economic growth and trade disputes. Benchmark Brent crude oil fell to its lowest since early April, down more than 18 percent since reaching four-year highs at the beginning of October. The sturdy dollar tarnished the appetite for safe-haven gold , with the price down 0.2 percent at $1221.42 an ounce. Still, market watchers said appetite for equities is likely to remain firm unless there is a big sell-off in credit markets or a spike in volatility. An ETF tracking the performance of high-yield debt consolidated near three-week highs while gauges of volatility edged lower after a spike earlier this week. “As long as these two indicators are not flashing red, stock markets should remain supported,” said Marc Ostwald, a global strategist at ADM Investor Services in London.

2018-11-09,"(Recasts lead, adds campaigner comments, details) MILAN, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Italy’s biggest insurer Generali said on Friday it would stop offering insurance coverage for new coal mines and plants, marking a step up in the company’s support for green policies. Generali’s action, which comes ahead of a United Nations climate change conference in Poland in December, is the latest by a big insurance company that targets the coal industry as part of efforts move towards a lower carbon economy. Europe’s third biggest insurer said in a note on its website it would not provide insurance for coal-related assets of potential new clients and would not be increasing its minimal insurance exposure to coal-related activities. In late 2017, French insurer AXA said it planned to disinvest further from the coal industry. Others that have taken steps include Scor, Swiss Re and Zurich Insurance. But many companies - particularly in the United States - have lagged their European rivals. Earlier this year, Generali pledged to raise its investments in environmentally-friendly projects and eliminate its exposure to the coal sector, a package worth around 2 billion euros. To do that it said it would sell equity stakes and exit bond investments by bringing them to maturity or even divesting before maturity. Regarding its existing portfolio of coal-related activities — accounting for just 0.1 percent of non-life premiums — Generali said it was talking with its clients about their transition plans. “Generali’s move shows coal is increasingly becoming uninsurable,” Lucie Pinson of campaign group Unfriend Coal said.

Sapura Energy will transfer $350 million of its debt into the new firm, called SEB Upstream Sdn Bhd (SUP), of which OMV has agreed to refinance half, an OMV spokesman said. OMV also agreed to pay up to an extra $85 million, dependent on whether an exploration in Mexico is successful and on the future oil price, the spokesman said, adding that there was no time frame for the payment of the sum.

2018-11-09,"LONDON (Reuters) - A deal to create the UK’s second biggest retail power provider has been delayed to beyond the first quarter of next year, with SSE (SSE.L) and Innogy (IGY.DE) renegotiating merger terms after Britain’s regulator proposed a cap on energy bills.  The merger, a major shake-up of the UK power market that would cut the dominant big six firms to five, comes after the government ramped up scrutiny of Britain’s big energy suppliers, which it has accused of ripping off customers. SSE said the two firms were discussing changes to the terms of the planned tie-up of their British retail units, and that the deal was unlikely to be completed until after the first quarter of 2019. It did not give a new timeframe for when talks might be concluded. It said the talks were expected to take place over several weeks, with an update on progress to be given by mid-December. Innogy said adjustments could include additional financial contributions by each party. “The impact of some recent market developments means that the commercial terms associated with the proposed combination will need to be reconsidered,” SSE said in a statement. Such developments include the potential impact of the regulator’s cap on the most commonly used tariffs on the new company’s requirement to post collateral against its credit exposure, and its ability to obtain and retain an appropriate credit rating, SSE said. Regulator Ofgem proposed the price cap on default energy bills - those to which customers default once fixed price periods end - to save households about 1 billion pounds ($1.31 billion) a year. The regulator said it will cap average default electricity and gas bills at 1,137 pounds a year from Jan. 1, a level well below the most-used tariffs set by the country’s big six suppliers. SSE and npower, Innogy’s British unit, won final regulatory approval for the tie-up last month, clearing the way for the creation of a new entity with around 23 percent market share, the second largest in the UK market behind Centrica’s (CNA.L) British Gas, with 27 percent. Analysts said the delay was a surprise, since both companies have known of the impending price cap for many months. “We believe (a) cash injection into the new entity is the key driver for this need to adjust commercial terms,” analysts at Bernstein said in a research note. SSE issued a profit warning in September after the company was hit by lower output from its wind farms and high gas prices. Npower has struggled to make money from its UK retail business. An Ofgem report last month said the company’s margin for supply energy was -5 percent. Shares in SSE were down 3 percent while shares in Innogy slipped 0.5 percent by 1040 GMT. Assessing the broader implications of the delay is complicated by the convoluted nature of the European energy market.  A planned asset swap between Innogy’s German parent RWE and peer E.ON (EONGn.DE) would see Innogy’s assets, likely including npower, divided between the two companies. E.ON said on Friday the delay in the SSE/npower tie-up would not lead to any material impact on the Innogy transaction.

2018-11-09,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s automobile sales fell 11.7 percent in October, bringing the world’s biggest car market closer to an annual contraction not seen since at least 1990. Data from the country’s top auto industry association released on Friday showed 10-month cumulative sales falling,  amid broader slowing economic growth and a biting trade war between China and the United States. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said overall vehicle sales for January-October totalled 22.87 million, down 0.1 percent from the same period a year earlier. Sales in October were 2.38 million, the fourth straight month of declines and the steepest drop since early 2012.  “Maintaining positive growth to the end of the year won’t be easy. There could be negative growth,” Yao Jie, vice secretary general of CAAM, said at a briefing in Beijing. Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight, said the October drop was in line with expectations, but there was little ahead to suggest things would pick up soon. “Things don’t look good all the way to the end of the year, because of weakness in the market and the high base for comparison from last year,” he said, adding he was watching to see if car makers made a push to spur sales. “If the OEMs give up then sales volumes could be really bad.” The industry body said the drop was linked to sluggish consumer demand and the impact of a slowing economy. In previous months CAAM also said that the trade war was impacting sales. The downtrend in sales underscores how international car makers, from General Motors (GM.N) to Toyota Motor (7203.T), are in for a tough ride at a time when they are increasingly looking towards China as a driver of growth. China’s car market is also a major employer, economic growth driver and barometer of consumers’ willingness to open their purse strings for big ticket items. China’s car dealers have been pushing for Beijing to help prop up the sector, including a proposal to authorities to cut the level of purchase tax on some smaller cars in half. Reuters’ checks showed that some dealers are now offering big discounts to customers to maintain sales. Shi Jianhua, another senior CAAM official, added the body was not pushing for short-term stimulus measures to support the market and would prefer any incentives to be longer-term. CAAM had originally forecast a 3 percent rise for the year, in line with last year’s growth, though still sharply down from a 13.7 percent gain in 2016. Sales of new-energy vehicles – a category comprising electric battery cars and plug-in electric hybrid vehicles – remained strong, up 51 percent in October, edging down slightly from the pace of growth a month earlier. That took new-energy vehicle sales in the first 10 months of this year to 860,000 vehicles, up 75.6 percent from the same period a year earlier.

2018-11-09,"MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - It was billed as the deal that proved Russia remained open for business. “I want to congratulate you”, Russian President Vladimir Putin told his trusted ally Igor Sechin, after greeting him with a warm handshake in the Kremlin in December, 2016. Sechin had just announced the sale to Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund and giant commodity trader Glencore of a 19.5 percent stake in Rosneft, the state oil giant that he runs. The 10.2 billion euro ($11.57 billion) privatization deal was designed to replenish Russia’s coffers, depleted by falling energy prices and Western sanctions. Some Russian officials hailed it as proof that despite growing political isolation from the West the country could still attract global investors. But now, nearly two years after the sale was first announced, nine sources with knowledge of the transaction have told Reuters that VTB, a Russian state-owned bank, itself financed a large share of the acquisition, undermining the deal’s stated aim to bring foreign money into the country. Based on accounts from five of the sources, the value of the Russian loan to the Qatari sovereign wealth fund is around $6 billion. VTB denied it issued a loan to the Qatari sovereign wealth fund, called the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA). “VTB has not issued and is not planning to issue a loan to QIA to finance the acquisition.” VTB data for September published by the Russian central bank showed that VTB loaned 434 billion roubles ($6.7 billion) for up to three years to unnamed foreign borrowers after having raised 350 billion roubles via loans from the central bank itself. VTB’s financial results, published on Nov. 8, showed that during the third quarter the volume of loans to its 10 biggest borrowers had gone up by 403 billion roubles, or approximately $6 billion. VTB declined to comment on the transactions, and the central bank did not respond to questions. The QIA declined to comment. The Kremlin did not comment. Rosneft did not respond to questions about the VTB loan to Qatar. Rosneft - the world’s biggest listed oil company by output -  is the jewel in Russia’s corporate crown. But with Russia under sanctions, and facing the prospect of more sanctions to come, Sechin faced an uphill task in finding buyers or creditors willing to risk their own money to acquire a stake in Rosneft. The sanctions, imposed by the United States and European Union in the aftermath of Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region, limit the access of Russian firms to international debt markets. In the end, to get foreign investors on board, Russia has had to loan them billions, according to the sources’ account.  Two sources familiar with the deal said that having a third party finance a large part of the acquisition was a condition for Qatar taking the stake. With oil prices today significantly higher than in late 2016, Russia’s need for foreign money has subsided. But should it need to tap international markets again, the story of the Rosneft sale points to the challenges it could face in bringing investors on board, especially as the United States levies more sanctions against Russia. The nine sources who told Reuters about the VTB loan to Qatar included a source close to VTB management, a Russian central bank official and a Russian government source familiar with foreign investments in Russia. At least four of the sources were directly involved in preparations for the loan. All the sources requested anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the deal. In response to questions about how the privatization of its stake as a whole was conducted, Rosneft said the deal was market-based and transparent and in the interests of all shareholders. It said all decisions relating to the deal underwent the relevant procedures for corporate approval, that the deal was supported by governments where participants are based, and was subject to compliance procedures in the relevant jurisdictions. “This is a unique example of an effective privatization,” Rosneft said in a statement. As the end of 2016 drew nearer, Sechin, one of Putin’s closest lieutenants, was under pressure. The government had publicly announced it would sell a 19.5 percent stake in Rosneft by the end of the year. The state budget, battered by a collapse in oil prices, an economic slump and the impact of Western sanctions, was showing a deficit of 3.5 percent. Russia’s economy was in its second year of recession and there was no prospect of a quick improvement in public finances. By the autumn, Sechin, who is now 58, thought he had a buyer: the United Arab Emirates’ sovereign wealth fund Mubadala. According to two sources familiar with the developments, Mubadala agreed to buy the stake. But negotiations hit a snag after Rosneft twice changed the price tag, the two sources said, prompting the Emiratis to walk away from the deal. Mubadala declined to comment. Rosneft did not address questions about the Mubadala discussions. Sechin turned east and started talks with Japanese officials, according to a Russian government official, a source close to Rosneft and a recording of a conversation involving Sechin that emerged as part of an unrelated court case in which Sechin was a witness. The talks were held primarily with the Japanese Economy, Trade and Industry minister, Hiroshige Seko. If the deal was agreed, the owner of the stake would have become a large state Japanese investment fund such as GPIF, the government pension investment fund which has over $1.4 trillion assets under management, or state-run Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corp (JOGMEC), three sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters. That deal also ran into difficulties, according to Sechin’s account in the recording played in court, when Japan insisted on linking it to progress in a territorial dispute with Russia dating back to the end of World War Two. Eventually, the deal collapsed. Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry did not respond to questions. Rosneft did not address Reuters’ questions about discussions with Japan. JOGMEC’s press service said it could not comment. GPIF said it could not comment on a discussion between governments because it was not directly involved. Still without a buyer, Sechin focused on two new potential suitors: Qatar’s investment fund QIA and global commodities trader Glencore. Neither was prepared to put up all of the asking price, according to three sources. In the past, Rosneft had gone to major Western banks, such as Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan, to finance transactions, but the big international lenders have announced no major new loan deals with Rosneft since sanctions were imposed in 2014. In stepped Intesa Sanpaolo, a mid-sized Italian lender which had little experience in large Russian corporate deals. By early December, 2016, financing for the deal was falling into place. The buyers put in some of their own money: Qatar gave 2.5 billion euros and Glencore 300 million euros. The rest was debt, of which Intesa put up 5.2 billion euros. The balance, according to Glencore at the time, would come from unnamed Russian banks. The amount coming from the Russian banks was about $2.5 billion. Two banking sources close to Rosneft told Reuters that VTB was one of the banks that between them put up $2.5 billion in loans back in 2016. Those sources said the other Russian banks involved were Gazprombank and Otkritie, which, like VTB, have Kremlin connections, although Otkritie was privately held at the time. It is not clear what share of the $2.5 billion each of the three banks contributed. That contribution from VTB toward the $2.5 billion was separate to around $6 billion that, according to the nine sources, VTB provided to Qatar this year. In response to questions about the initial $2.5 billion in loans, VTB said it did not provide financing but it was the coordinating bank on behalf of Rosneft. Otkritie declined to comment. Gazprombank did not respond to questions. For the larger portion of the financing — the 5.2 billion euros loaned by Intesa — the Italian bank’s intention was to syndicate the loan, a common industry practice designed to spread the risk and dilute the burden on the bank’s own capital. But two banking sources and a source familiar with the Italian side of the deal said the syndication failed because European banks approached by Intesa were worried about the risk that providing finance for Rosneft, even if indirectly, would result in them falling foul of Western sanctions on Russia. Rosneft and Sechin are both subject to U.S. sanctions. Intesa declined to comment. At the time of the December 2016 announcement and in the weeks afterwards, Russian officials spoke publicly of a long-term partnership with the new Rosneft shareholders, Qatar and Glencore. But it became clear that the agreement was still in flux when, in September 2017, Sechin said a deal had been signed for Chinese energy firm CEFC to buy 14.2 percent of Rosneft from Qatar and Glencore. Explaining why the original deal had not stuck, he told Russian state television the new shareholders were finding the cost of servicing the debt too high. The Chinese deal though, was never closed. Before it was sealed, CEFC’s founder and chairman Ye Jianming was taken in for questioning and investigated by Chinese authorities for suspected economic crimes.  Since then there has been no word on the status of the investigation, or if Ye has been charged. He was named, however, in a high-profile graft trial of a senior Communist Party official, state broadcaster CCTV reported last month. Neither Ye nor CEFC responded to calls from Reuters seeking comment. Once again, Sechin was in search of a buyer. Finally, in May this year, Qatar agreed to take on the part of the stake that had been covered by Intesa.  Officially, no one has said how the new deal with Qatar is being financed, or who is providing the finance. It is clear that Intesa’s role has ended.  A document dated Sept. 6, 2018 and lodged with Singapore’s official business register, where the vehicle that held the stake on behalf of Qatar and Glencore is registered, stated that Intesa had ceased to be the creditor for the stake and no longer held shares as collateral. The document did not state who was the new creditor. According to the nine sources familiar with the arrangement, that new creditor is VTB.  At a reception at the Italian embassy in Moscow last November to receive an award “for services to Italy”, Sechin, champagne glass in hand, linked arms with a grey-haired Russian man in fashionable glasses. It was Andrey Kostin, the chief executive of the bank that helped to finance the privatization – Russia’s VTB.

2018-11-09,"BAKU, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Azeri state energy company SOCAR plans to supply its new refinery in Turkey with oil from different producers in Europe, the Black Sea region and the Gulf, the head of SOCAR’s trading arm said in an interview. SOCAR last month launched the $6.3 billion SOCAR Turkey Aegean Refinery (STAR), the first to be built in Turkey for the past 30 years. The facility on Turkey’s Aegean coast will supply feedstock to Turkish petrochemicals firm Petkim to help cut Turkey’s dependence on imports of refined oil products. It will boost the country’s refining capacity by 25-30 percent. “Initial consumption (of oil) will be 100,000 barrels per day with a further increase to 215,000 bpd,” Adnan Ahmadzadeh, SOCAR Trading executive chairman, said in answers to Reuters questions sent by email. “SOCAR Trading will supply oil (to STAR) from different producers at ports in the Mediterranean, Black Sea and Persian Gulf, as well as from Russian company Rosneft.” He said the company had secured contracts to buy А-92 grade gasoline from producers in Russia, Switzerland and Turkmenistan due to planned maintenance at the Azeri Heydar Aliyev refinery in the capital Baku. Russia and Swiss company Vitol have provided around 30,000 tonnes of gasoline each, while around 5,000-10,000 tonnes will be shipped from Turkmenistan. Geneva-based SOCAR Trading was set up in 2007 and has become a global player in the last few years, having previously been only a marketer of its country’s crude, Azeri Light. Poaching top traders from established rivals, it moved into paper trading and third-party oil. Ahmadzadeh said oil was still “playing a central role” in the firm’s trading strategy, having a 50 percent share in its portfolio. The firm last year traded 1.54 million bpd of crude oil, of which about 1.06 million bpd was from third parties, it said in July. Combining crude and oil products, it traded 104 million tonnes. The firm also started trading liquefied natural gas in 2017. Ahmadzadeh said the company had decided to reduce the share of fuel oil - recently at 30 percent - in its trading portfolio. “The strategic decision has been made, but it will start to reflect on figures in 2019,” he said. Ahmadzadeh said SOCAR Trading was open to discussions on obtaining crude from Russia’s Filanovsky and Rakushechnoye oilfields in the Caspian Sea operated by Russian company Lukoil , with shipment via the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline. “We are ready for dialogue on these oilfields and don’t see any problems from a technical viewpoint on getting these oil flows,” he said. Ahmadzadeh said the company would soon start selling polypropylene and low-pressure polyethylene from SOCAR’s polymer plant, which started operating in August. The main export markets will be Turkey, Europe, China and India. As for the fertiliser carbamide (urea), which is expected to be produced at a plant in the city of Sumgait in 2019, exports will focus on Turkey, Romania, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Greece, Israel and Italy. Annual production is estimated at 600,000 tonnes.

2018-11-09,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Saikat Chatterjee LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Global stocks were heading for their biggest drop in two weeks and emerging market currencies also slipped on Friday as a confident U.S. central bank and weak Chinese data hit demand for risky assets. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe fell half a percent, its biggest drop since Oct. 26, as the U.S. Federal Reserve held interest rates as expected but indicated that another rate increase is likely in December. While the decision to hold rates was anticipated by markets, some participants had expected a more cautious approach from the central bank after a stock market rout in October. But the Fed indicated a December increase is a distinct possibility in a robust economy. That contrasts sharply with China, where cooling producer price inflation and falling car sales suggested an economy struggling to gain traction. “Worries about trade wars and how the slowdown in China will impact the rest of the world mean stocks appear to be more risky, so there’s a typical risk-off move in markets today,” said DZ Bank rates strategist Pascal Segesser. Stocks in Hong Kong and China were the main losers in Asia, where a financial sector sub-index fell more than 2 percent after China’s banking watchdog told lenders to allocate at least a third of new loans to private companies, raising the prospects of a jump in bad assets. European stocks followed Asia lower, with main indexes opening in the red, though a batch of company earnings and UK GDP data might offer some support later in the session. MSCI’s main European index was down nearly 1 percent and the broader Euro STOXX 600 fell 0.7 percent. A confident Fed also gave a boost to the dollar, which had weakened sharply after mid-term elections this week raised the prospects of U.S. political gridlock. The greenback gained a quarter of a percent against the euro and half a percent against the British pound. The dollar index measuring the currency against its six major rivals gained 0.25 percent to 96.86. Losses in equities pressured bond yields lower, with safe-haven benchmark debt in Germany and the United States softening across the board, pressured by world trade frictions and a budget standoff between Italy and Brussels. Oil prices fell to multi-month lows as global supply increased and investors worried about the impact on fuel demand from of lower economic growth and trade disputes. Benchmark Brent crude oil fell to its lowest since early April, down more than 18 percent since reaching four-year highs at the beginning of October. The sturdy dollar tarnished the appetite for safe-haven gold , with the price down 0.2 percent at $1221.42 an ounce. Still, market watchers said appetite for equities is likely to remain firm unless there is a big sell-off in credit markets or a spike in volatility. An ETF tracking the performance of high-yield debt consolidated near three-week highs while gauges of volatility edged lower after a spike earlier this week. “As long as these two indicators are not flashing red, stock markets should remain supported,” said Marc Ostwald, a global strategist at ADM Investor Services in London.

2018-11-09,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The owner of the Fukushima nuclear plant, destroyed by an earthquake and tsunami nearly eight years ago, said on Friday it planned tests early next year to see how much melted uranium fuel has cooled in the damaged reactors. The tests planned for January to March will stop water cooling in the reactors to analyze how the melted uranium core reacts and heats up after cooling has stopped, said owner Tokyo Electric Power Co. All reactors need to be cooled to limit the radioactive reactions that produce heat to generate electricity. At Fukushima, Tepco jury-rigged cooling systems after the quake and tsunami wrecked the plant in March 2011. The natural disaster triggered meltdowns at three of the Fukushima Daiichi plant’s six reactors, spewing radiation into the air, soil and ocean and forcing 160,000 residents to flee, many of whom have not returned. From January, Tepco will begin to gradually reduce the amount of water being pumped over the melted fuel in reactor No. 2 at the site to half the amount over a week, a company spokesman said. Then Tepco will resume full pumping, but in March the company will stop all cooling for a seven-hour period to test analytical models which have shown that the reactors will not overheat, he said.  Tepco said it would use the test results to better understand radioactive reactions during an emergency cooling halt. It will also help manage other water issues at the site. Tepco has for years struggled to control the amount of water in the basements of the damaged reactors. Groundwater flowing from hills above the plant enters the reactors, where it mixes with highly radioactive debris. The contaminated material is pumped out and treated before being stored in tanks that are quickly filling up.

2018-11-09,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Low water levels on the Rhine river have caused a fuel supply deficit in parts of Europe’s industrial heartlands that is sucking up cargoes from more than 10,000 km away in Singapore.  Following a long, scorching summer, water levels on the Rhine - a key commodity shipping lane connecting industrial centres in Switzerland, Germany, France and the Netherlands to major seaports - fell to record lows, limiting the transport of coal, steel, grains and fuel.  That has created a shortage of heating oil heading into the European winter, pushing up the market and triggering a search for supplies from as far away as Southeast Asia, where there is ample fuel and gasoil prices are low.  Northwest European prices for gasoil hit a record $35-per-tonne premium over Singapore values LGOAEFSMc1 for November fuel deliveries, and December premiums are still above $20 a tonne. That means gasoil could be pulled into Europe from Southeast Asia via arbitrage trades through the end of the year.  “The wide arb means it’s possible to shift gasoil to the West (Europe) at a profit,” said Sukrit Vijayakar, director of Indian energy consultancy Trifecta, adding that the situation stemmed from the low Rhine water levels and Asian refineries coming out of turnarounds.  The arbitrage to Europe from Asia is usually workable when the price spread is at least $15-$18 a tonne. Many Asian refineries have just come out of maintenance, or turnarounds, increasing the region’s availability of fuels like gasoil.  Gasoil inventories held in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) refining and storage hub STK-GO-ARA fell for the fourth straight week to 2.4 million tonnes, the lowest volume since mid-July this year, according to data from Dutch consultancy PJK International. [ARA/]  By refilling ARA stocks with gasoil, including from Asia, traders said they hope to be able to ship gasoil up the river as soon as water levels recover.  Some meteorologists expect low water levels to last until January, however, which may mean a continuation of the blockage and ongoing market distortions.  As a result, European traders may start exporting gasoil out of the region to offset arbitrage volumes into ARA from Asia.  “It is one thing to ship the distillates from Singapore to Europe. But it will not reach the end-customer as long as ship traffic is constrained due to low water levels of the Rhine and other rivers,” said Carsten Fritsch, a commodity analyst at Germany’s Commerzbank.  “German retail gasoline and heating oil prices are very high as a result ... No visible improvement is in sight here in the near future, according to German weather forecasts,” he said.  Europe typically starts to stockpile gasoil, which is used for heating in the region, ahead of the cold winter months. Asian refiners, though, must act fast to serve the European demand window, as American and also Russian suppliers are also eying the opportunity.  “Comparing Asian refiners with their U.S. counterparts, the latter stand a better chance to go to Europe as freight rates are cheaper and the voyage time is very much shorter,” one trader in Singapore said, declining to be named as she was not allowed to talk in public about commercial operations.  Despite America’s advantage over Asia to supply Europe, ship tracking data in Refinitiv Eikon shows one tanker, the Diva, carrying gasoil from Southeast Asia to Europe.  The 37,000 tonne tanker is currently in the Mediterranean and expected to arrive at Antwerp on Nov. 16.  “If this arb window stays open, I’d expect more such routes to be fixed next week,” said a Singapore-based tanker charterer, also declining to be named.

2018-11-09,"* Buyers to head to Tehran next week for talks * S.Korea can import up to 200,000 bpd for 180 days -sources (Adds detail, graphics, analyst comment; changes slug) By Florence Tan and Jane Chung SINGAPORE/SEOUL, Nov 9 (Reuters) - A South Korean delegation including oil buyers is expected to head to Iran next week to discuss resuming Iranian oil imports after a three-month halt, three sources with knowledge of the matter said. South Korea is one of eight countries that received waivers from the United States to continue importing Iranian oil for 180 days. It can import up to 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian oil, mostly condensate, the sources said, without invoking U.S. economic sanctions re-imposed on Iran on Nov. 5. The North Asian country was the third-biggest buyer of Iranian oil and also the largest importer of its condensate before it stopped imports in September ahead of U.S. sanctions. South Korea’s condensate imports from Iran stood at 159,770 bpd in January-August, down about 49 percent from 311,885 bpd in the same period last year, according to Reuters calculations based on the Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC) data. Condensate is an ultra light oil processed at splitters, typically to produce naphtha for petrochemicals. While the waiver has given South Korea the green light to resume Iranian oil imports, the sources said issues such as payment, shipping and insurance needed to be worked out. “The actual (import) volume will depend on next week’s negotiations,” one of the sources said, adding that the oil’s price will be a key factor. The U.S. sanctions waivers have eased pressure on Iran to further discount its oil against Saudi Arabia’s. SK Incheon Petrochem, a petrochemical unit of SK Innovation ; Hyundai Chemical, a unit of Hyundai Oilbank ; and Hanwha Total Petrochemicals, a joint venture between Hanwha Corp and France’s Total , are regular buyers of Iranian condensate. Each of the three imported between 1 million and 3 million barrels of South Pars condensate a month in the first half of the year, the KNOC data showed. “Having a waiver doesn’t mean you have it in your pocket. You still have to work through the supply chain,” Fereidun Fesharaki, chairman of energy consultancy FGE said at the Condensate and Naphtha Forum in Singapore on Thursday. South Korea will be paying for Iranian oil in Korean won to escrow accounts handled by the Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) and Woori Bank, according to a South Korea’s foreign ministry statement released early this week. Officials from both banks said, however, that won-denominated payments for Iranian oil were still being reviewed, and that no schedule for a resumption has been set. Buyers are also likely to receive oil delivered by Iran using tankers owned by the National Iranian Oil Co. The United States has warned of potential accidents and costs involving Iranian tankers that are not covered by international insurance. FGE analyst Den Syahril estimates that Iran has been holding about 20 million barrels of South Pars condensate in storage since August as demand fell. Another major South Pars buyer, the Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC), has also stopped imports. South Pars exports, which averaged just above 300,000 bpd in the first half of this year, could fall below 200,000 bpd in the next two years depending on demand from South Korea and China, Fesharaki said.

2018-11-09,"Nov 9 (Reuters) - Germany has earmarked 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) to support a consortium looking to produce electric car battery cells and plans to fund a research facility to develop next-generation solid-state batteries, three sources told Reuters. The measures, expected to be announced by Economy Minister Peter Altmaier next week, are designed to reduce the dependence of German carmakers on Asian battery suppliers and protect German jobs at risk from the shift away from combustion engines. Below are details of plans to establish electric vehicle (EV) battery plants in Europe: NORTHVOLT northvolt.com The Swedish company, headed by a former Tesla executive, aims to build Europe’s biggest lithium-ion battery factory, producing 32 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery cells a year by 2023, rivalling Tesla’s U.S. “gigafactory”. It has partnered with German carmaker BMW ahead of plans to raise 1.5 billion euros in debt and equity to build an initial 8 GWh of capacity and has asked for a 400 million euro loan from the European Investment Bank. German industrial giant Siemens is helping to build the factory. Northvolt will become its preferred supplier for lithium-ion batteries when production starts in 2020. Northvolt is also planning a factory in Poland to produce battery systems for energy storage companies and the mining industry. The plant in Gdansk would take cells from the Swedish factory and use them to develop battery systems or modules. A Northvolt spokesman said the company was not involved in talks to forge a German-led consortium, but he said Northvolt would welcome more alliances in Europe. U.S. electric carmaker Tesla favours Germany as the location for its first European gigafactory, its chief executive Elon Musk said in July. Tesla already has operations in Pruem, Germany, with its Grohmann Automation division that specialises in automated manufacturing systems for battery making plants. Tesla has said it plans to build three more gigafactories to accompany its first in Nevada, United States. That plant is jointly owned by Panasonic, which is the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla’s mass-market Model 3 sedan. China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co (CATL) said in July it would build its first production site in Europe in Germany and the plant would supply carmaker BMW with lithium-ion batteries. BMW plans to source 4 billion euros of battery cells from CATL over the next few years, with 1.5 billion euros coming from the new site in Erfurt in eastern Germany. The CATL factory will create about 600 jobs and reach a production capacity of 14 gigawatt hours (GWh) by 2022. CATL had shipments of 12 GWh in 2017. Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD  is one of the world’s biggest battery producers with the lowest production costs, according to Bernstein Research. BYD is considering cell production in Europe, an executive told Reuters earlier this year, adding it was not clear where it might be located. The company has two production sites for electric buses in Europe, in Hungary and France. South Korea’s LG Chem plans to produce 100,000 EV batteries per year at its new Polish factory near the western city of Wroclaw, 190 km (120 miles) from the German border. The LG Chem plant supplies batteries to German carmakers Audi, Porsche and Daimler. It has also secured a contract to supply batteries for Germany’s Volkswagen starting in late 2019. The factory’s planned output of 100,000 battery cells is equivalent to roughly 4 GWh per year which means the plant’s capacity is just a fraction of expected future demand in Europe. GSR CAPITAL www.gsrcapital.com/en Chinese investment firm GSR Capital last year bought Nissan Motor Co’s electric vehicle battery business - Automotive Energy Supply Corp - including battery plants in Japan, the U.S. state of Tennessee and England. The UK plant produces 2 GWh of lithium ion batteries per year for Nissan electric vehicles. Japanese battery maker GS Yuasa Corp said in January it would set up a factory in Hungary that would assemble lithium ion batteries and would consider producing cells on the site in the future. South Korea’s Samsung SDI Co started production at a new factory near Budapest this year that is expected to produce batteries for 50,000 electric vehicles a year. Samsung SDI, an affiliate of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , also produces rechargeable batteries for electronic devices such as smartphones and energy storage systems. Samsung SDI, which already has a plant in Austria assembling battery packs, has supplied batteries to Volkswagen and BMW. South Korea’s SK Innovation plans to break ground this year on a battery plant in Hungary and launch production from 2020, producing 7.5 GWh of batteries per year. SK Innovation started as Korea Oil Corporation and owns South Korea’s largest crude oil refiner. It also has divisions for chemicals, lubricants, batteries and electronic materials. SAFT www.saftbatteries.com France’s Saft, owned by energy company Total produces a range of batteries, including for back-up power and industrial applications, but not for electric vehicles. In February, it created an alliance with German industrial group Siemens, Solvay and Manz to develop a new generation of batteries. The group will focus on advanced high-density lithium-ion and solid-state technology, targeting the market for electric vehicles, railway, marine sectors, among others. A Saft spokesman said the company was not participating in Germany’s e-mobility summit on Nov. 12-13 and that Saft was not aware of another multinational battery cell alliance. TERRAE www.terrae.com The German-based consortium of 17 companies and research institutions announced plans last year to build two foundries, where lithium-ion battery cells are produced to customers’ specifications. It said its two planned factories would have a capacity of 34 GWh by 2028, which would top Northvolt’s plans. But the consortium has run into liquidity problems as companies shied away from investing, industry sources told Reuters. So the future of TerraE remains unclear. A spokesman of TerraE did not respond when asked by Reuters to give an update of its battery cell plans. Volkswagen’s supervisory board is due to discuss its electric car and battery cell strategy at a meeting on Nov. 16. The German carmaker has said in the past that it was studying battery cell production at its plant in Salzgitter. A source told Reuters on Thursday that the board would discuss a far-reaching alliance with South Korean battery cell maker SK Innovation. BMW is establishing a technology consortium with Northvolt and Belgium’s Umicore to develop a value chain for battery cells in Europe, including development, production and, ultimately, recycling. The company has also said it will purchase specific raw materials such as cobalt, and then make them available to battery cell suppliers as a way to secure a supply of electric car batteries. Daimler said it would add battery manufacturing capabilities to its Mercedes-Benz plants in Sindelfingen and Untertuerkheim in the southern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg. The company is already assembling batteries in its Kamenz plant in the eastern state of Saxony, but the factory relies on imported battery cells. German auto parts and tyre maker Continental AG formed a joint venture in March with Chinese auto parts supplier CITC to produce so-called mild hybrid batteries in China. Continental also said it was considering making EV batteries using solid-state technology, but for was holding out for now until more advances have been made in the field.

2018-11-09,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany has earmarked 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) to support a consortium looking to produce electric car battery cells and plans to fund a research facility to develop next-generation solid-state batteries, three sources told Reuters. The measures, expected to be announced next week, are designed to reduce the dependence of German carmakers on Asian electric vehicle (EV) battery suppliers and protect German jobs at risk from the shift away from combustion engines. Berlin’s push to shape industrial policy marks a break with its generally “hands off” approach to business decisions and is part of European efforts to forge battery alliances to counter the dominance of Chinese, Japanese and Korean firms. Ensuring local companies are involved throughout the electric vehicle supply chain is particularly important for Germany as it has become so economically dependent on the success of its car industry. But Germany’s car battery push could be too late. Asian market leaders are ramping up output and some experts say there’s a risk of a glut that could hinder the establishment of large-scale battery cell production by European newcomers. For Chancellor Angela Merkel’s fractious ruling coalition, the plan is also a way to show voters ahead of three elections next year in eastern Germany that it can get its act together to help Europe’s largest economy thrive in the electric car era. “We have a concentration of risk in the automobile sector. The industry is too dependent on the combustion engine,” Deputy Economy Minister Christian Hirte told Reuters. “The government therefore wants to help the sector in its efforts to diversify.” Hirte said Berlin was in talks with several companies and other governments in Europe to support a battery cell factory. “There are possibilities for example in the Lausitz region, maybe in cooperation with Poland,” said Hirte, who is the government’s coordinator for Eastern German affairs and for small- and medium-sized enterprises policy. “One thing is clear: you cannot ignore east Germany if you are planning such mega projects. There is a lot of space and the acceptance among the population is great.” Companies involved in talks with Economy Minister Peter Altmaier about building a factory include German battery maker VARTA Microbattery, chemical giant BASF (BASFn.DE) and Ford’s (F.N) German subsidiary Ford-Werke GmbH, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. A spokeswoman for BASF said it would attend a meeting with Altmaier next week. Varta (VAR1.DE) and Ford declined to comment. Varta specializes in batteries for hearing aids and large storage systems for solar energy. It said last month it was studying the production of large lithium batteries and was in intensive discussions with relevant market actors. Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) supervisory board is due to discuss its electric car and battery cell strategy at a meeting on Nov. 16. The German carmaker has said in the past that it was studying battery cell production at its plant in Salzgitter. A source told Reuters on Thursday that the board would discuss a far-reaching alliance with South Korean battery cell maker SK Innovation (096770.KS). Some analysts say Europe is already too far behind in the race with Asian firms, at least with the current technology. Boston Consulting Group (BCG), for example, has estimated global battery cell production capacity will exceed demand by about 40 percent in 2021, exerting massive pressure on prices and making it hard for new entrants to make money. South Korea’s LG Chem (051910.KS) is already supplying some German carmakers with EV batteries made in Poland while Samsung SDI Co (006400.KS) and SK Innovation are planning factories in Hungary. The announcement by the world’s biggest EV battery maker -  China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL) 300750.SZ -  that it would build its first European plant in eastern Germany and has struck a deal with German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has been welcomed by the government. But Merkel told business leaders it was “extremely important” Germany also develops its own battery cell capacity to secure the country’s role in the car industry. For years, German car bosses have been reluctant to push ahead with electric cars, instead focusing on diesel engines. But they now face a challenge to make combustion engines comply with tougher emissions rules introduced following the emissions cheating scandal that engulfed Volkswagen. Despite BCG’s predictions of a glut, analysts at consultants McKinsey & Company and Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute say there will be room for European newcomers as demand is likely to outstrip supply when automakers ramp up EV production. German carmakers have warned, however, that jobs could disappear - because it takes less time to build electric cars and as positions shift overseas to foreign battery makers. Germany’s VDA auto industry association has said a ban on combustion engine-powered vehicles in 2030 would threaten 436,000 jobs at car companies and their suppliers. “Battery cells are a key technology and an important part of the value chain. That’s why we want to locate this in Germany,” Hirte said. Recognizing the importance of a homegrown battery industry for jobs and profits, the European Commission launched its own European Battery Alliance (EBA) in 2017 but Sweden’s Northvolt is seen as the only serious contender to emerge so far. As part of Berlin’s push, Economy Minister Altmaier is talking to German and European companies as well as neighboring countries to try to join forces. He is coordinating his efforts with Brussels to resolve any state aid and antitrust issues. “In a few years, Europe will have a competitive battery cell sector that can survive without state aid,” Altmaier said in September after meeting the EU’s Vice-President for Energy Union Maros Sefcovic, who has been the driving force behind the EBA. Altmaier is expected to announce more details of his battery cells plan during a two-day conference in Berlin starting on Nov. 12 that will be attended by Sefcovic. The billion euros earmarked for a German battery cells consortium would help establish a first factory, probably in western Germany, two sources familiar with the plans said. Berlin is also willing to support a second plant, possibly in the Lausitz region near the German-Polish border where two of the regional elections in 2019 will take place, they said. An Economy Ministry spokeswoman said Altmaier was in talks with all relevant parties and no decisions had been made. In addition, the government wants to spend up to 500 million euros to co-finance a research factory to help put German companies ahead of the curve when solid-state batteries are ready for the mass market, another source told Reuters. Lithium-ion batteries are likely to be overtaken in a matter of years by solid-state technology that is expected to produce cheaper batteries with higher energy density. The location of the research factory has not been decided and the government is about to start a tender process in which authorities and firms can pitch for the site, the source said. A Science Ministry spokesman said the government was supporting efforts to develop solid state batteries by bringing together leading research institutes with the private sector. Companies involved in the network, known as FestBatt, include Varta, BASF, Volkswagen, BMW, car parts maker Continental (CONG.DE), conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (TKAG.DE), carbon fiber specialist SGL Carbon (SGCG.DE), Belgian materials firm Umicore (UMI.BR), Coperion and Heraeus, the spokesman said. For now, German carmakers are sourcing battery cells predominantly from Asian suppliers such as CATL, LG Chem and Samsung SDI although BMW has struck a partnership with Northvolt.  Underlining the uphill battle German firms face, one of the world’s biggest automotive suppliers, Bosch [ROBG.UL], has opted out of making lithium-ion cells, saying it would be too costly. Hans-Martin Henning, an electric mobility researcher at Fraunhofer, is less pessimistic. “If automakers boost their electric car production to 10 to 20 percent of total sales in coming years, Europe will need battery cell factories with more than 100 gigawatt hours,” he said, well above the capacity planned by Asian producers so far. “We’ll need far more battery cells in Europe - and this must happen pretty fast indeed,” Henning said. The expected shift to solid-state batteries could also make  European suppliers less dependent on the rare earth resources largely controlled by China that are used in lithium-ion cells. “The landscape will change dramatically in coming years,” Porsche CEO Oliver Blume told Reuters. “Europe absolutely has a chance.” Reporting by Michael Nienaber; additional reporting by Edward Taylor, Ilona Wissenbach, Ludwig Burger and Andrea Shalal; editing by David Clarke",https://uk.reuters.com/article/autos-batteries-germany/insight-stung-by-asian-dominance-germany-pours-cash-into-ev-battery-ventures-idUKL8N1XF0BK,09 Nov 2018,"Germany has earmarked 1 billion

2018-11-09,"(Repeats Nov 8 story with no changes) * Iran improvising to offset blow of US oil, banking sanctions * Considering selling some oil at discount to lure buyers * Selling cheap dollars to domestic importers of essential goods * Recession looms in 2019, inflation seen soaring through 2020 * Iranian officials say economy far from collapse, adaptable By Parisa Hafezi and Jonathan Saul DUBAI/LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Iran is likely to ride out the storm from U.S. oil sanctions, suffering recession but no economic meltdown, thanks to rising crude prices and deepening divisions between the United States and other major powers, officials and analysts say. “Iran’s situation is better than pre-2016 because of high oil prices and the fact that the U.S. is isolated this time,” said a European diplomat who asked not to be further identified. Iran emerged in early 2016 from years of global sanctions under a deal with world powers that curbed its disputed nuclear programme. But President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the deal in May, calling it flawed to Iran’s advantage, and reimposed far-reaching U.S. sanctions in phases, with the most damaging oil and banking penalties taking effect on Nov. 5. Trump aims to force Washington’s longtime adversary to accept tougher restrictions on its nuclear activity, drop its ballistic missile programme and scale back support for militant proxies in Middle East conflicts from Yemen to Syria. But the broadly united front of world powers that enforced sanctions on Iran previously, pushing Iran into nuclear restraint, has unravelled since Trump took office and clashed with allies over everything from trade to collective security. The other signatories to the nuclear deal - Germany, France, Britain, the European Union, Russia and China - have condemned Trump’s walkout from the pact. The EU is preparing a special mechanism to enable payments for Iranian oil and other exports without U.S. dollars, possibly through a barter system. “It will be a difficult period but Iran’s economy will withstand it for various reasons,” a second diplomat said, “including (the fact of) Russia being under (U.S. and EU)sanctions, Saudi Arabia having its own financial and political issues, and (trade war) between China and the United States.” Big power disunity and EU moves to circumvent Trump’s sanctions regime have given Tehran a psychological boost - but not dissuaded foreign businesses ranging from oil majors to trading houses and shipping concerns from pulling out of Iran for fear of incurring new U.S. penalties. Still, while the U.S. clampdown will probably trigger recession in Iran next year, economic meltdown should be avoided, with a reduced but still significant volume of oil exports continuing, a Fitch solutions analyst said. “Tehran is still likely to see a substantial share of its foreign exchange earnings maintained,” Andrine Skjelland told Reuters. “This will enable Tehran to continue subsidising imports of selected basic goods, keeping the costs of these down and thus limiting inflation to some extent.” In hopes of mitigating the immediate economic hit, Iranian authorities have hinted that Tehran might have to sell its oil at a discount to entice buyers going forward. “Oil revenues might decline but (they) will still be enough to run the country,” said an official involved in Iran’s international commerce. “If we sell our oil for $1 less than market price, it will have tens of buyers.” In another counter-measure made possible by state control of the oil sector, Iranian authorities are using special exchange centres to sell dollars at cheaper rates to importers of basic foods, medicine and other essential goods. IHS Markit senior economist Patrick Schneider doubted that Iran could cushion the economic blow in the near term. “Despite the rhetoric and attempts to mitigate the downside effects..., uncertainty will remain prevalent for the next 6-12 months,” he told Reuters. The International Monetary Fund has forecast that Iran’s economy will contract in 2018 by 1.5 percent and by 3.6 percent in 2019 due to the dwindling of oil revenues. At the same time the World Bank anticipates inflation in Iran jumping to 23.8 percent in 2018-19 from 9.6 percent in 2017-18, and to 31.2 percent in 2019-20. But Iranian officials are defiant, citing Trump’s isolation in repudiating the nuclear deal, climbing oil prices and Trump’s agreement to grant sanctions waivers to eight countries especially dependent on Iranian crude. “Crude prices are rising. Even if Iran’s oil sales drop to 800,000 barrels per day (bpd), we will be able to run the economy. But we will send much more than that. Our economy will be far from collapse,” said a senior Iranian official. “Our budget is based on oil of $57 per barrel and is now over $75 per barrel.” In October, Iran’s crude exports were estimated at 1.82 million bpd by data intelligence company Kpler and 1.5 million bpd by another firm that traces Iranian shipments. Trump granted 180-day sanctions waivers to China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey, which together took in over 80 percent of Iran oil exports last year, Refinitiv Eikon data shows. “Even without the exemptions, we will sell our oil. We will bypass sanctions. We have so many countries that are on our side. America cannot do a damn thing,” said a senior official close to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The sanctions, however, will inevitably erode Iran’s state finances and raise already high inflation and jobless rates, making life harder for ordinary Iranians. Since May, when Trump took Washington out of the nuclear deal, prices of bread, cooking oil and other staples have soared and the value of the rial currency has plunged. The rial’s weakness has sent prices of some imports rocketing, destroying jobs as some factories using imported parts have folded. Around 70 percent of small factories, businesses and workshops have begun to close down in the past few months due to scarcity of raw materials and hard currency, according to the Iranian state news agency IRNA. Moreover, Trump’s sanctions against Iran’s financial sector essentially make 30 banks and their subsidiaries off-limits to foreign lenders, undermining its means to facilitate trade. Still, Iran demonstrated considerable resilience and ingenuity in coping with earlier international sanctions, and there is little to suggest Tehran could not do this again. While ordinary Iranians struggled, Iran’s clerical and security establishment and business world sought kept the economy running by means including resorting to barter as well as foreign currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to follow Asia’s lead and open lower, with Britain’s FTSE losing 0.45 percent, Germany’s DAX slipping 0.3 percent and France’s CAC dipping 0.15 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.3 percent and was headed for a loss of more than 1 percent for the week. On Thursday, the index hit its highest level since Oct. 8. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng lost 2.4 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.2 percent. Australian stocks slipped 0.1 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI edged down 0.05 percent and Japan’s Nikkei shed 1.05 percent. The Fed held interest rates steady on Thursday but remained on track to continue gradually raising borrowing costs, pointing to healthy economic prospects that were marred only by a dip in the growth of business investment. The central bank has hiked U.S. interest rates three times this year and is widely expected to do so again next month. The S&P 500 lost 0.25 percent and the Nasdaq shed 0.53 percent on Thursday after the Fed’s statement, and energy stocks were the biggest drag on the S&P as U.S. crude oil prices fell. Wall Street shares spiked midweek following the U.S. midterm elections, on a relief rally as the vote did not deviate significantly from investor expectations. “The Fed meeting outcome and its statement did not produce major surprises, but it managed to reinforce views that a rate hike is coming in December and this tempered equities,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. “The Fed statement came after a steep surge in equities and gave the markets an opportunity to sell into the rally.” In currency markets, the dollar stood tall after advancing against its peers overnight, buoyed by higher Treasury yields and the Fed’s intent to continue tightening monetary policy. The dollar traded at 113.925 yen after brushing a five-week high of 114.09 overnight. The euro dipped 0.15 percent to $1.1346 after shedding 0.55 percent the previous day. The euro’s and yen’s declined helped the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies gain 0.75 percent on Thursday. It last stood little changed at 96.764. After the Fed statement, the two-year Treasury yield rose to 2.977 percent, the highest in 10-1/2 years. China’s yuan slipped to an eight-day low of 6.9497 per dollar in onshore trade, highlighting the diverging monetary policy outlooks for China and the United States. The U.S.-China trade row also remained in focus. “Trump’s administration will likely maintain a hawkish stance towards China, even though the Republicans lost the House during the midterm elections,” wrote Raymond Yeung, ANZ’s chief economist for greater China. Crude oil prices struggled near eight-month lows as investors focused on swelling global crude supply, which is increasing faster than many had expected. The market took stock of record U.S. crude production and signals from Iraq, Abu Dhabi and Indonesia that output will grow more quickly than expected in 2019. U.S. crude futures were down 0.08 percent at $60.62 per barrel after falling to $60.40 the previous day, the lowest since March 14. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange fell 0.5 percent to $6,122.5 a tonne. Copper fell 2.5 percent this week, poised for its biggest weekly loss since mid-August, pressured by a stronger greenback, which makes it more costly for non-U.S. buyers of dollar-denominated commodities.

2018-11-09,"* Rhine water levels hit record lows in October * River is a key fuel transport hub for Europe * Singapore traders plan to send fuel to Europe * Asia gasoil discount over Europe: tmsnrt.rs/2D5fs9n By Koustav Samanta SINGAPORE, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Low water levels on the Rhine river have caused a fuel supply deficit in parts of Europe’s industrial heartlands that is sucking up cargoes from more than 10,000 km away in Singapore. Following a long, scorching summer, water levels on the Rhine - a key commodity shipping lane connecting industrial centres in Switzerland, Germany, France and the Netherlands to major seaports - fell to record lows, limiting the transport of coal, steel, grains and fuel. That has created a shortage of heating oil heading into the European winter, pushing up the market and triggering a search for supplies from as far away as Southeast Asia, where there is ample fuel and gasoil prices are low. Northwest European prices for gasoil hit a record $35-per-tonne premium over Singapore values for November fuel deliveries, and December premiums are still above $20 a tonne. That means gasoil could be pulled into Europe from Southeast Asia via arbitrage trades through the end of the year. “The wide arb means it’s possible to shift gasoil to the West (Europe) at a profit,” said Sukrit Vijayakar, director of Indian energy consultancy Trifecta, adding that the situation stemmed from the low Rhine water levels and Asian refineries coming out of turnarounds. The arbitrage to Europe from Asia is usually workable when the price spread is at least $15-$18 a tonne. Many Asian refineries have just come out of maintenance, or turnarounds, increasing the region’s availability of fuels like gasoil. Gasoil inventories held in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) refining and storage hub STK-GO-ARA fell for the fourth straight week to 2.4 million tonnes, the lowest volume since mid-July this year, according to data from Dutch consultancy PJK International. By refilling ARA stocks with gasoil, including from Asia, traders said they hope to be able to ship gasoil up the river as soon as water levels recover. Europe typically starts to stockpile gasoil, which is used for heating in the region, ahead of the cold winter months. Asian refiners, though, must act fast to serve the European demand window, as American and also Russian suppliers are also eying the opportunity. “Comparing Asian refiners with their U.S. counterparts, the latter stand a better chance to go to Europe as freight rates are cheaper and the voyage time is very much shorter,” one trader in Singapore said, declining to be named as she was not allowed to talk in public about commercial operations. Despite America’s advantage over Asia to supply Europe, ship tracking data in Refinitiv Eikon shows one tanker, the Diva, carrying gasoil from Southeast Asia to Europe. The 37,000 tonne tanker is currently in the Mediterranean and expected to arrive at Antwerp on Nov. 16. “If this arb window stays open, I’d expect more such routes to be fixed next week,” said a Singapore-based tanker charterer, also declining to be named.

2018-11-09,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian energy majors are putting pressure on Western oil buyers to use euros instead of dollars for payments and introducing penalty clauses in contracts as Moscow seeks protection against possible new U.S. sanctions.     Seven industry sources told Reuters that Western oil majors and trading houses have clashed with Russia’s third and fourth biggest producers, Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegaz, over 2019 oil sales contract terms during unusually tough annual renegotiation in recent weeks.     The development mirrors a similar stand-off between Western buyers and Russia’s top oil producer, Rosneft (ROSN.MM). Earlier this week, trading sources told Reuters that Rosneft wants Western oil buyers to pay penalties from 2019 if they fail to pay for supplies in the event that new U.S. sanctions disrupt sales.     Now sources have told Reuters that Surgutneftegaz and Gazprom Neft have also clashed with their buyers over penalties and the use of euros and other currencies to replace the dollar in contracts. “It is part of the same trend - the Russian oil industry is working on mitigating new sanctions risks. The buyers in turn argue they cannot carry those risks so we are trying to find compromises,” said one source with a Western buyer involved in negotiations, asking not to be named as the talks are confidential. Russia has been under U.S. and EU sanctions since 2014 when it invaded Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula. The sanctions have been repeatedly widened to include new companies and sectors, making it tough for Russian oil firms to borrow money abroad, raise new capital or develop Arctic and unconventional deposits. President Vladimir Putin’s administration has been hoping for a thaw in relations with the United States since President Donald Trump came to power but Washington has imposed new sanctions instead, including on some of Russia’s richest people. Russian businesses are preparing for a new wave of sanctions expected in the coming weeks. The firms are trying to diversify away from dollar payments and tapping Asia for more of their financing and technology needs. According to four industry sources, Surgutneftegaz asked buyers to be prepared to switch from dollar to euro payments in contracts, and insisted on buyers being effectively responsible for any losses arising from sanctions. “They basically said - sanctions don’t matter. Buyers have to find a way to pay, or to return purchased goods, or pay penalties,” a source with a big trading house said. Gazprom Neft has also asked buyers to use euros in payments and bear financial responsibility for contract breaches in the case of new sanctions, according to three sources. Gazprom Neft refused to comment. Surgutneftegaz did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.     Russia supplies over 10 percent of global oil, so drastic sanctions against it could lead to a steep spike in oil prices. All global oil majors rely on Russia to feed their refineries, especially in Europe and Asia, and hence they cannot just walk away from annual contract negotiations if they are unhappy with terms. Talks with both Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegaz have been progressing slowly and painfully, according to trading sources. Several Western buyers have managed to agreed compromises with Surgutneftegaz and Gazprom Neft, but others are still in tough talks with the producers, the sources said. All Surgutneftegaz’s contracts are bespoke and are negotiated individually in the Siberian town of Surgut by the firm’s management and visiting Western trading bosses. The sources declined to name companies that have already reached compromise deals. In one such compromise, a large European buyer agreed to the use of euros in payments in exchange for Surgutneftegaz dropping its demand for penalties from buyers who fail to pay for cargoes. “We have been arguing that if sanctions make it impossible to pay for an oil cargo, how on earth are we supposed to pay penalties,” one trading source said. “So we have agreed that the payment remains suspended for the entire duration of sanctions - just like it works with Iran,” he added.

2018-11-09,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - China’s record imports of crude oil in October are without a doubt a bullish outcome, but within the broader pattern of growing demand there were some temporary factors lifting purchases. China imported 40.8 million tonnes of crude in October, equivalent to 9.61 million barrels per day (bpd), a figure that beat the previous record of 9.60 million bpd from April. Imports jumped a massive 31.5 percent from the same month a year earlier, and also by 9.6 percent from September, according to customs data. It’s probably worth trying to split the underlying trend in China’s oil imports from the short-term factors that can cause outcomes such as October’s record. The Chinese oil import story is still one of strength, with economic growth, falling domestic output and the ongoing strategic storage buildup all contributing. For the first 10 months of the year, China, the world’s biggest crude buyer, imported 9.06 million bpd, a gain of 8.1 percent over the same period in 2017. None of the three factors driving China’s underlying import growth show any sign of changing dramatically in the short to medium term. Even though China’s economic growth has softened slightly as the United States imposes trade tariffs, it’s likely that stimulus measures will help to keep gross domestic product expanding at a rate above 6 percent. It’s also likely that China’s domestic oil production will continue its gentle slide, as shown by the 1.9 percent drop to 3.77 million bpd in the first three quarters of the year compared to the same period a year earlier. China is also still some way from completing its goal of holding reserves equivalent to 90 days of import cover, with the International Energy Agency estimating it held 287 million barrels at the end of 2017. China doesn’t disclose how much crude it is directing into its strategic reserves, although various energy analysts believe it is in the region of 100,000 bpd. Against this backdrop of solid underlying demand growth, October added a couple of factors that are unlikely to be permanent. The first is that smaller, independent refiners were active in the month, buying almost 2 million bpd, which is a record high, according to data from Refinitiv Oil Research and Forecasts. The independents were likely buying crude to use up their import quotas before they expired, raising the possibility that demand from this sector will moderate a touch in coming months. There also seemed to be a bit of rush to buy Iranian crude before the Nov. 4 resumption of U.S. sanctions against the Islamic Republic’s exports. Imports from Iran were 654,000 bpd in October, according to Refinitiv data, which was 43 percent higher than September’s 458,000 bpd. The above numbers come with a caveat insofar as it’s becoming harder to track Iranian exports as the country’s tankers have started disabling their vessel-monitoring systems. It may have been the case that Chinese importers were stocking up on Iranian crude ahead of the renewed U.S. sanctions. This raises the possibility that China may wind back purchases in coming months, especially since the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump decided to grant waivers to eight buyers of Iranian crude, including top purchasers China and India, for a period of six months. It’s also worth noting that China’s exports of refined products were only slightly weaker in October than in September, with 4 million tonnes being shipped, down from 4.06 million. This equates to about 1.03 million bpd of product exports, with Chinese refiners likely to be keen to sell into the strong regional market for middle distillates such as diesel and jet fuel, where the profit margins are at, or close to, four-year highs. China’s product exports are up 19.4 percent in the first 10 months of the year, compared to the same period last year. Overall, the picture that emerges is that China’s appetite for imported crude oil remains strong and growing, and October’s record, while boosted by temporary factors, is unlikely to last for too long given the robust fundamentals. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.  Editing by Joseph Radford",https://uk.reuters.com/article/column-russell-crude-china/column-chinas-record-crude-oil-imports-built-on-robust-fundamentals-temporary-boosts-russell-idUKL4N1XK1QK,09 Nov 2018,"China's record

2018-11-09,"(Adds detail) SHANGHAI, Nov 9 (Reuters) - China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) is continuing to take oil from Iranian oilfields where it has ownership stakes, even after the United States re-imposed sanctions on the country’s oil sector, a company executive said on Friday. The state-owned oil giant entered Iran in 2004 when it acquired the MIS oilfield, in which it now holds a 75 percent stake. CNPC did not give an output figure for the field on its website. It has also spent billions of dollars on developing the North Azadegan oilfield, which began production in 2016 of about 80,000 barrels per day of crude along with natural gas, according to the company’s website. “Our main cooperation with Iran is upstream investment. Lifting equity oil is recouping our investment there,” Hou Qijun, deputy general manager for CNPC, said on the sidelines of an industry event. The United States re-imposed on Monday sanctions targeting Iran’s oil, banking and transport sectors, but offered waivers to some countries to still buy Iranian crude. Under the waiver, China is allowed to buy 360,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil from the Islamic Republic for 180 days, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters this week. The volume does not include oil Sinopec and CNPC are entitled to under investment deals, the sources said. China, Iran’s top oil customer, has purchased an average of 655,000 barrels a day of crude oil from Tehran during the January-September period, according to customs data.

2018-11-09,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A coastal city in southeastern China sought to reassure residents on Friday about their safety after a chemical spill into the ocean, which dissolved fishing nets, ignited fears about air and water contamination. Chinese social media users have written thousands of posts urging the government in Quanzhou in Fujian province to identify the chemicals released during the leak from a tanker last week and accused the government of withholding information. A local chemical trading firm leaked seven tonnes of the C9 aromatic solvent into the sea at an oil port in Quanzhou when loading the chemical into a tanker on Nov. 3, according to state media.  Fujian Donggang Petrochemical, which operates chemical storage facilities at the port, did not follow proper safety practices when transferring the aromatic solvent from its storage to the vessel, causing the leakage, the Quanzhou government said in a statement on Friday.  Internet users expressed concern that the solvent could have included xylene, whose inhalation can affect the central nervous system and trigger symptoms such as headaches, dizziness and nausea.  The government said in its statement that a local hospital had received 52 patients who reported headaches, vomiting and sore throats after breathing the air near the spill site. One person also fell into the water at the spill site and is being treated in hospital for pneumonia, the statement added. However, the statement made no direct mention of whether xylene was present.  The city government said it is still cleaning up the spill, but tests showed air quality met health standards and water quality is also safe as of Friday.  The solvent chemical also dissolved floating nets at a fishing farm, and the government will start compensating 152 fish farms affected by the spill, the government added. The Chinese government launched a “war on pollution” in 2014 in a bid to reverse environmental damage and head off public anger, which has in some cases led to mass protests.

2018-11-09,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) edged higher this week, reversing the declining trend of recent weeks due to renewed appetite for spot cargoes, but unsold cargoes capped gains, traders said. Spot prices for December delivery LNG-AS into North Asia were estimated at $10.30 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), up 10 cents from a more than two-month low struck over the past two weeks. Japanese power utility Kansai Electric Power Co (9503.T) was seeking two cargoes for delivery in December, while Japan’s Tohoku Electric Power Co Inc (9506.T) was seeking a cargo for delivery over Dec. 25 to Dec. 30, traders said.  Kansai could have purchased at least one cargo at $10 to $10.30 per mmBtu, while Tohoku may have received lowest offers for its cargo requirement in the range of $10.60 to $10.70 per mmBtu, they added. Japan’s Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal 9801.T had been sounding out the market about a potential spot purchase for delivery in the second half of December to January, one trader said. The temperature in Tokyo is expected to dip below average next week and also in Beijing in two weeks, weather data from Refinitiv Eikon showed.  Demand from South Asia was also seen with tenders emerging from India and Pakistan.  Essar Steel India sought an LNG cargo on a delivered ex-ship (DES) basis for delivery into Dahej over Dec. 28-29 on LNG trading marketplace Global LNG Exchange (GLX) this week but failed to attract sellers. Pakistan State Oil returned to the spot market after several months hiatus, seeking three cargoes for delivery in January and February. Still, high freight rates for LNG tankers are curbing demand, after hitting $200,000 a day, exceeding a 2012 peak of $180,000 a day. There were still several unsold cargoes in the spot market, which kept a lid on prices, traders said.  Australia’s Ichthys LNG project has shipped its second and third LNG cargoes, Refinitiv Eikon shiptracking data showed. LNG tanker Gaslog Skagen loaded from the Ichthys LNG plant on Oct. 28 and discharged the cargo into the Guangxi LNG terminal in China on Nov. 7, the data showed.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.06 percent. The index was headed for a loss of 1 percent during the week, during which it managed to rise to a one-month high on Thursday. Australian stocks were flat, South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.2 percent and Japan’s Nikkei fell 0.2 percent. The Fed held interest rates steady on Thursday but remained on track to keep gradually tightening borrowing costs, as it pointed to a healthy economy that was marred only by a dip in the growth of business investment. The central bank has hiked U.S. interest rates three times this year and is widely expected to do so again next month. The S&P 500 lost 0.25 percent and the Nasdaq shed 0.53 percent on Thursday after the Fed’s statement, and energy stocks were the biggest drag on the S&P as U.S. crude oil prices fell. With the U.S. midterm congressional elections out of the way, Wall Street shares had spiked midweek on a relief rally. “The Fed meeting outcome and its statement did not produce major surprises, but it managed to reinforce views that a rate hike is coming in December and this tempered equities,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. “The Fed statement came after a steep surge in equities and gave the markets an opportunity to sell into the rally.” In currencies, with Treasury yields pushing up, the dollar stood tall after advancing against its peers overnight, buoyed by Fed’s largely upbeat economic outlook and its intent to keep tightening monetary policy. The dollar traded at 113.995 yen after brushing a five-week high of 114.09 overnight. The euro was steady at $1.1365 having shed 0.55 percent the previous day. Thanks to the greenback’s gains against the euro and yen, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies gained 0.75 percent on Thursday. After the Fed statement, the two-year Treasury yield rose to 2.977 percent, the highest in 10-1/2 years. Crude oil prices struggled near eight-month lows as investors focused on swelling global crude supply, which is increasing more quickly than many had expected. The market took stock of record U.S. crude production and signals from Iraq, Abu Dhabi and Indonesia that output will grow more quickly than expected in 2019. U.S. crude futures were little changed at $60.69 per barrel after falling to $60.67 the previous day, the lowest since March 14.

2018-11-09,"* Oil prices hit 4-year highs in early October * Crude has since slumped as supply rises, demand slows * Iran sanctions impact dampened by broad exemptions * U.S., Russia, Saudi crude output: tmsnrt.rs/2Rua0R8 By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Oil markets on Friday remained weak as rising supply and concerns of an economic slowdown pressured prices, with U.S. crude now down by 20 percent since early October. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $61.63 per barrel at 0125 GMT, down 4 cents from their last settlement. Front-month Brent crude oil futures were at $70.79 a barrel, 14 cents above their last close However, both Brent and WTI have declined by around 20 percent from four-year highs in early October. “Oil prices continue to decline and are now officially in a bear market, having declined 20 percent from their (October) peak,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities. Reuters technical commodity analyst Wang Tao said on Friday that “Brent oil may slide further into a range of $68.59-$69.69 per barrel.” That would be the first time Brent has fallen below $70 since April. Analysts said the main downward price pressure came from rising supply, despite the U.S. sanctions against Iran that were imposed this week, as well as concerns over an economic slowdown. “As OPEC exports continue to rise, inventories continue to build which is putting downward pressure on oil prices,” analysts at Bernstein Energy said. “A slowdown in the global economy remains the key downside risk to oil,” Bernstein added. The decline in prices over the past weeks follows a rally between August and October when crude was pushed up ahead of the re-introduction of sanctions against Iran’s oil exports on November 5. These sanctions, however, will unlikely cut as much oil out of the market as initially expected as Washington has granted exemptions to Iran’s biggest buyers which will allow them to continue buying limited amounts of crude for at least another six months. “Sanctions on Iran are so far proving to be less severe than first thought ... because the U.S. has now issued waivers to a raft of countries,” O’Loughlin said. Bernstein Energy expects “Iranian exports will average 1.4-1.5 million barrels per day (bpd)” during the exemption period,” down from a peak of almost 3 million bpd in mid-2018.

2018-11-09,"(Repeats with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2QAh6n2 By John Kemp LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. government’s finances are on an unsustainable trajectory and are likely to worsen further after the mid-term elections, adding to the list of problems facing the global economy and oil markets in 2019/2020. The U.S. federal government’s outlays exceeded its receipts by $779 billion in Fiscal Year 2018, which ended on Sept. 30, according to the Congressional Budget Office (“Monthly budget review”, CBO, Nov. 7). The budget deficit would have been even worse at $823 billion if certain outlays had not been brought forward and recorded in the previous financial year because the first day of Fiscal 2018 fell on a weekend. Even so, the deficit increased to 3.8 percent of gross domestic product, up from 3.5 percent the previous year, and the highest since Fiscal 2013, when the economy was still recovering from the global financial crisis. Government receipts increased by just $14 billion (less than 1 percent) while outlays rose by $127 billion (around 3 percent), worsening the deficit by $113 billion compared with the previous year. Higher receipts from individual income taxes (+$96 billion), payroll taxes (+$9 billion) and customs duties (+$7 billion) were mostly offset by lower collections from corporate income taxes (-$92 billion) and fines (-$7 billion). Government outlays increased for net interest on the public debt (+$62 billion), social security (+$43 billion), defence (+$38 billion), Medicare (+$16 billion) and Medicaid (+$14 billion). Increased government spending, especially on defence, has helped fuel the acceleration in economic growth (“A big reason U.S. economy is accelerating; government spending”, Wall Street Journal, Oct. 25). But the federal government’s deteriorating financial position and increased borrowing needs are also driving up yields on Treasury securities affecting borrowing costs across the entire economy and worldwide. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes have risen to more than 3.2 percent, more than double the recent low in 2016, and the highest since 2011 (tmsnrt.rs/2QAh6n2). Tax cuts and increased spending at a relatively late point in the economic cycle have also encouraged the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates in order to hold inflationary pressure in check. The combination of fiscal stimulus and tightening monetary policy has caused the exchange rate to appreciate, worsening the trade deficit as exporters and import-competing firms lose competitiveness to foreign rivals. In effect, the economy is being over-stimulated by fiscal policy and the resulting imbalance is showing up in rising interest rates, increasing borrowing costs, an appreciating exchange rate and a widening trade deficit. Government borrowing is likely to increase over the next two years, making all these financial imbalances even worse, and creating a major source of vulnerability in the global economy. The Congressional Budget Office has forecast the budget deficit will worsen to around $1 trillion (around 4.5 percent of GDP) in both Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2020 (“The budget and economic outlook”, CBO, April 2018). In practice, the government’s financial position is likely to deteriorate even more than this as the president and Congress compete for votes ahead of the next elections by seeking to extend tax cuts and raise spending. With Congress divided between a Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and a Republican-controlled Senate, legislators are unlikely to agree on either spending cuts or tax increases to contain the deficit. Instead, lawmakers and the president are more likely to try to please their core supporters by agreeing to extend selected tax breaks and spending programmes in a bid to buy votes ahead of the next election in 2020. President Donald Trump has already indicated he wants to work with congressional Democrats on a big infrastructure bill saying on Wednesday “we have a lot of things in common on infrastructure”. Funding for major infrastructure programmes could come from the federal government, state and local governments, or private sources. Federal government funding would hit the deficit directly. Funding from state and local sources or the private sector, perhaps with tax incentives, would further stimulate an economy already operating close to full capacity. If the economy starts to slow in 2019 or 2020, the president and congressional leaders will push for even more tax cuts and higher spending to offset the slowdown. Even more than other administrations, the current White House has linked its credibility to the strength of the economy and a rising stock market, so it will do everything possible to avert a recession between now and 2020. The most likely scenario is that the fiscal position will continue to deteriorate in 2019/2020, keeping upward pressure on interest rates, borrowing costs, the exchange rate and the trade deficit. This course is obviously unsustainable over the long run, although it is not clear whether it can be kept going for at least two more years until after the next election. In the meantime, the risk of sudden and disruptive changes in inflation, interest rates, asset prices or the exchange rate are a major source of risk to the global economy and oil consumption in 2019/2020.
