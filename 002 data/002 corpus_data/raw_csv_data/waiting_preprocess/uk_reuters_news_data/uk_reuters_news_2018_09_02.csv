2018-09-02," (The Sept. 1 story corrects the location to Mobbar in paragraph 7) By Ola Lanre and Ahmed Kingimi MAIDUGURI (Reuters) - Islamist militants have killed up to 30 soldiers in an attack on a military base in northeast Nigeria, security sources said on Saturday, in one of the biggest attacks of its kind this year.  Thursday’s attack by suspected members of Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA) was on a base in Zari village in the north of Borno State. In 2016 ISWA split from Boko Haram, the jihadist group which has killed more than 30,000 people in the region since 2009, when it launched an insurgency to create an Islamic caliphate. The Zari attack highlights the challenge to secure the northeast, months ahead of a February election in which security looks set to be a campaign issue.   “The battle lasted for about two hours and our colleagues fought them but things became bad before the fighter jets arrived. We lost about 30 of our soldiers and about 10 were wounded,” said a military source who did not want to be named. Another, who also did not want to be named, said 20 to 30 troops had been killed in a surprise attack. Details only emerged days later because it occurred in a remote area near the border with Niger.  The attack, in the Mobbar local government area of Borno, is the latest blow to Nigeria’s efforts to defeat insurgencies by Boko Haram and ISWA.  Earlier this week Reuters reported that Nigerian government officials had ordered thousands of displaced people to return to Guzamala, an area considered by aid agencies to be unsafe, as pressure mounts to show progress in the war against the insurgents ahead of the presidential election.  President Muhammadu Buhari, a former general, won the 2015 election after vowing to crush Islamist militants. He plans to seek a second term in February.  In July the fourth commander in 14 months was named to lead the fight against the militants after a number of embarrassing defeats, despite the government having said since late 2015 that the Islamists in the region had been defeated. And 20 Nigerian soldiers went missing in mid-July following a clash with militants in the Bama area of Borno. Military sources say the troops are feared dead.

2018-09-02,"BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Police used tear gas to disperse around 150 protesters at the main entrance to Iraq’s giant Nahr Bin Omar oilfield on Sunday, police sources said, amid growing unrest in southern cities over poor public services and corruption. Officials at the field in the southern oil hub of Basra said operations were running normally. Production from Nahr Bin Omar, which is operated by the state-run Basra Oil Co., now stands at around 44,000 barrels per day, oilfield officials said. On Friday, hundreds of Iraqi protesters stoned and tried to break into the provincial government headquarters in the southern oil hub of Basra demanding better public services and an end to pervasive corruption. Around 3,000 people gathered there again on Sunday and set fire to tyres outside. Protesters threatened to break into the field if the government did not respond to their demands to improve basic services and address their complaints over Basra’s drinking water, which residents say is undrinkable due to high salt levels. “We will not allow the oilfield to operate unless we get clean water. No services, no jobs and now no clean water. We are fed up,” said Hassan Ali, a protest organiser. Iraqi political blocs are attempting to form a coalition government after a May 12 parliamentary election tainted by allegations of fraud.  Oil exports from Basra account for more than 95 percent of OPEC producer Iraq’s state revenues. Any potential disruptions to production could severely impact Iraq’s limping economy. Police also dispersed protesters who tried to prevent trucks moving on a main road to the east of Basra which leads to a border crossing with Iran, customs and police officials said.

2018-09-02,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Sunday war was unlikely but called on Iran’s armed forces to boost their defence capacities, according to his official website, as the country faces increased tension with the United States. On Saturday, Iran announced plans to boost its ballistic and cruise missile capacity and acquire modern fighter planes and submarines to boost its defences following the U.S. pullout from Tehran’s nuclear agreement with world powers.  “Ayatollah Khamenei emphasised that based on political calculations there is no likelihood of a military war but added that the armed forces must be vigilant ... and raise their personnel and equipment capacities,” the website quoted Khamenei  as telling commanders of Iran’s air defence forces. “The Supreme Leader said ...the air defence units were a very sensitive part of the armed forces and on the front line of confronting the enemy, and emphasized the need to increase their readiness and capabilities,” the website said in its report on the gathering, which was held to mark Iran’s Air Defence Day. Saturday’s news of the military development plans came a day after Iran dismissed a French call for negotiations on Tehran’s future nuclear plans, its ballistic missile arsenal and its role in wars in Syria and Yemen.  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said last month the Islamic Republic’s military prowess was what deterred Washington from attacking it. Separately, a senior Iranian diplomat met visiting UK Junior Foreign Minister Alistair Burt and urged swift European action on a planned package of economic measures to offset the U.S. pullout from the accord and the reimpositions of sanctions by Washington, the state news agency IRNA reported. “The imposition of (U.S.) sanctions and pressures and the lack of rapid action by Europe to fulfil their commitments will have serious consequences,” Kamal Kharrazi, a former foreign minister who heads a top foreign policy council, told Burt, IRNA reported. Iranian officials have said they would decide whether to quit the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers after studying the European package of economic measures that could help offset U.S. sanctions.  “European countries have not been able yet to take necessary measures to secure Iran’s interests under the nuclear agreement,” Kharrazi said. “(Burt) said Britain’s position is different from that of the United States and we are looking for a European mechanism to make the nuclear accord successful,” IRNA reported. In a meeting with senior parliamentarian Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh, Burt referred to the case of a British-Iranian dual national detained in Iran, IRNA reported. “I thank Iran for its humanitarian act to grant Nazanin Zaghari furlough and her meeting with her family, and we hope that this approach will continue until the release and the pardon of such people,” Burt said, according to IRNA. Britain is seeking the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation. She was arrested in April 2016 at Tehran airport as she was heading back to Britain with her daughter, now aged four, after a family visit. She was released for three days last month. Burt, on the first visit by a British minister since U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal, earlier met Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Saturday the talks with Burt had involved “access to banking resources and the sale of oil”. Iran has been seeking commitment from European signatories of the nuclear deal that it will be able to access the Western banking system and continue to sell oil despite U.S. sanctions. In a statement before his visit, Burt said: “As long as Iran meets its commitments under the deal, we remain committed to it as we believe it is the best way to ensure a safe, secure future for the region.”  Reporting by Dubai newsroom; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-khamenei/update-3-khamenei-says-war-unlikely-but-urges-boosting-irans-defences-idUKL8N1VO0BS,02 Sep 2018,"Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah

2018-09-02,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Qatar plans to invest billions of dollars more in Germany and will broaden its focus to the country’s medium-sized companies, business newspaper Handelsblatt said in a report due to be published on Monday. Citing diplomatic and company sources, the paper said that the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and private sector players would be looking at Germany’s “Mittelstand” manufacturing companies. “We see Germany as a key player in the world economy and are looking at the German market with great optimism,” Handelsblatt quoted Qatar’s Minister of Finance Ali Sharif al-Emadi as saying.  “Our delegation will be announcing big new investments,” he said in an interview in the Handelsblatt report ahead of a Qatar Germany Business and Investment Forum in Berlin on Sept. 7. Qatar, the world’s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), has shareholdings in companies including Volkswagen (VOWG.DE), Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Siemens (SIEGn.DE), Hochtief (HOTG.DE) and SolarWorld SWVKk.F. Handelsblatt calculated that they jointly amounted to $20 billion. Al-Emadi said Qatar was happy with its investments, despite having incurred some losses from Solarworld and Deutsche Bank engagements. “We have a lot of stamina, and that goes for all sectors,” he said.

2018-09-02,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany’s Transport Ministry said on Sunday there was no fresh news in a Bild am Sonntag report that Volkswagen (VOWG.DE) engineers told investigators certain petrol engines in VW, Audi and Porsche vehicles can be used to manipulate emissions tests. The ministry said in a statement to Reuters that the newspaper report pertained to allegations that the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) had already examined. There had been no indication so far of any fraud concerning VW petrol-fueled cars, the statement said. Earlier, a spokesman for Volkswagen - the parent company of Audi and Porsche - said VW would not comment on an ongoing investigation, adding that the company in recent months had held intensive talks with the KBA.  “There are no new circumstances here,” he said. The Munich and Braunschweig prosecutors offices that are involved in probes into VW group brands could not be reached for comment. Bild said gearboxes and software could be manipulated so that vehicles show lower levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and fuel consumption, citing internal documents and witness statements. VW’s emissions scandal has cost the carmaker 27 billion euros ($31.3 billion) in penalties and fines for systematic manipulation of diesel-powered cars to mask excessive pollution levels. In Europe, vehicles are taxed according to their levels of polluting CO2 emissions.  VW in 2015 admitted that around 36,000 petrol-fueled cars were also being tested for excessive emissions. VW had the 36,000 cars checked by a neutral body under supervision by the regulator and found minimal deviation from requirements. The automaker was not required to make any technical changes to those vehicles. Regulators in the United States blew the whistle on deliberate emissions cheating on Sept. 18, 2015 after it emerged that the carmaker had developed an engine that failed to conform to pollution standards. VW used software to detect when a car was being subjected to a regulatory emissions measurement test, and throttled back the engines during the test cycle, masking excessive pollution. When a car engine was being accelerated and gears changed, VW’s onboard software would check whether the steering wheel was also being used. If the steering wheel angle was not being altered, VW knew a vehicle was strapped to a dynamometer test bench, activating exhaust emission filters.

2018-09-02,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq’s Foreign Ministry said on Sunday it was “astonished” at a Reuters report that Iran had moved missiles to Iraq and that the article was “without evidence”, but stopped short of denying its contents. “Iraq is not obliged to respond to media reports that lack tangible evidence backing up their claims and allegations,” the ministry said in a statement. “All state institutions in Iraq uphold Article 7 of the constitution, which prohibits the use of Iraqi land as a base or passage to be used in operations targeting the security of other states.” Iranian, Iraqi and Western sources told Reuters that Iran had given ballistic missiles to Shi’ite proxies in Iraq and was developing the capacity to build more there. The Iraqi government and military declined to comment at the time. In Sunday’s statement, the Foreign Ministry said it was “astonished at the allegations” contained in the report. Iran on Saturday rejected the report, which it said aimed to hurt Iran’s ties with neighbours. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Twitter he was “deeply concerned” by news that Iran was transferring ballistic missiles into Iraq. He urged Iraqi leaders to form a new government quickly after a May 12 parliamentary election. Any sign Iran is preparing a more aggressive missile policy in Iraq will exacerbate tensions between Tehran and Washington, already heightened by U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. It would also embarrass France, Germany and Britain, the three European signatories to the nuclear deal, as they have been trying to salvage the agreement despite new U.S. sanctions against Tehran. According to three Iranian officials, two Iraqi intelligence sources and two Western intelligence sources, Iran has transferred short-range ballistic missiles to allies in Iraq over the last few months. Five of the officials said it was helping those groups to start making their own.

2018-09-02,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s sovereign fund has named Andrew Liveris, the former chairman and chief executive of Dow Chemical, as a special adviser, in its highest-profile appointment of any global manufacturing executive.  Liveris will work closely with the Public Investment Fund (PIF) on matters of strategic importance, assist the fund in efforts to boost the value of its portfolio, and ensure the contribution of PIF companies to Saudi Arabia’s economic vision program 2030, the fund said in a statement on Sunday. His appointment comes as the PIF, chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is negotiating the sale of its majority stake in Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) 2010.SE to oil company Aramco. Liveris joined the Aramco board on July 1. The PIF said Liveris had extensive experience working in Saudi Arabia over the last two decades and under his leadership, Dow DuPont worked with Aramco to develop the Sadara Chemical petrochemical complex. The PIF, which manages more than $250 billion in assets, aims to increase its asset portfolio to $400 billion by 2020. More than half of its assets are tied up in large Saudi companies, but the PIF has also made substantial overseas commitments. This included a $45 billion agreement to invest in a giant tech fund led by Japan’s Softbank [9984.T] and another $20 billion committed to an infrastructure investment fund planned with Blackstone (BX.N).

2018-09-02,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Qatar plans to invest billions of dollars more in Germany and will broaden its focus to the country’s medium-sized companies, business newspaper Handelsblatt said in a report due to be published on Monday. Citing diplomatic and company sources, the paper said that the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and private sector players would be looking at Germany’s “Mittelstand” manufacturing companies. “We see Germany as a key player in the world economy and are looking at the German market with great optimism,” Handelsblatt quoted Qatar’s Minister of Finance Ali Sharif al-Emadi as saying.  “Our delegation will be announcing big new investments,” he said in an interview in the Handelsblatt report ahead of a Qatar Germany Business and Investment Forum in Berlin on Sept. 7. Qatar, the world’s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), has shareholdings in companies including Volkswagen (VOWG.DE), Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Siemens (SIEGn.DE), Hochtief (HOTG.DE) and SolarWorld SWVKk.F. Handelsblatt calculated that they jointly amounted to $20 billion. Al-Emadi said Qatar was happy with its investments, despite having incurred some losses from Solarworld and Deutsche Bank engagements. “We have a lot of stamina, and that goes for all sectors,” he said. Germany’s economy ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request to comment.

2018-09-02,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany’s Transport Ministry said on Sunday there was no fresh news in a Bild am Sonntag report that Volkswagen (VOWG.DE) engineers told investigators certain petrol engines in VW, Audi and Porsche vehicles can be used to manipulate emissions tests. The ministry said in a statement to Reuters that the newspaper report pertained to allegations that the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) had already examined. There had been no indication so far of any fraud concerning VW petrol-fueled cars, the statement said. Earlier, a spokesman for Volkswagen - the parent company of Audi and Porsche - said VW would not comment on an ongoing investigation, adding that the company in recent months had held intensive talks with the KBA.  “There are no new circumstances here,” he said. The Munich and Braunschweig prosecutors offices that are involved in probes into VW group brands could not be reached for comment. Bild said gearboxes and software could be manipulated so that vehicles show lower levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and fuel consumption, citing internal documents and witness statements. VW’s emissions scandal has cost the carmaker 27 billion euros ($31.3 billion) in penalties and fines for systematic manipulation of diesel-powered cars to mask excessive pollution levels. In Europe, vehicles are taxed according to their levels of polluting CO2 emissions.  VW in 2015 admitted that around 36,000 petrol-fueled cars were also being tested for excessive emissions. VW had the 36,000 cars checked by a neutral body under supervision by the regulator and found minimal deviation from requirements. The automaker was not required to make any technical changes to those vehicles. Regulators in the United States blew the whistle on deliberate emissions cheating on Sept. 18, 2015 after it emerged that the carmaker had developed an engine that failed to conform to pollution standards. VW used software to detect when a car was being subjected to a regulatory emissions measurement test, and throttled back the engines during the test cycle, masking excessive pollution. When a car engine was being accelerated and gears changed, VW’s onboard software would check whether the steering wheel was also being used. If the steering wheel angle was not being altered, VW knew a vehicle was strapped to a dynamometer test bench, activating exhaust emission filters.

2018-09-02,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq’s Foreign Ministry said on Sunday it was “astonished” at a Reuters report that Iran had moved missiles to Iraq and that the article was “without evidence”, but stopped short of denying its contents. “Iraq is not obliged to respond to media reports that lack tangible evidence backing up their claims and allegations,” the ministry said in a statement. “All state institutions in Iraq uphold Article 7 of the constitution, which prohibits the use of Iraqi land as a base or passage to be used in operations targeting the security of other states.” Iranian, Iraqi and Western sources told Reuters that Iran had given ballistic missiles to Shi’ite proxies in Iraq and was developing the capacity to build more there. The Iraqi government and military declined to comment at the time. In Sunday’s statement, the Foreign Ministry said it was “astonished at the allegations” contained in the report. Iran on Saturday rejected the report, which it said aimed to hurt Iran’s ties with neighbours. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Twitter he was “deeply concerned” by news that Iran was transferring ballistic missiles into Iraq. He urged Iraqi leaders to form a new government quickly after a May 12 parliamentary election. Any sign Iran is preparing a more aggressive missile policy in Iraq will exacerbate tensions between Tehran and Washington, already heightened by U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. It would also embarrass France, Germany and Britain, the three European signatories to the nuclear deal, as they have been trying to salvage the agreement despite new U.S. sanctions against Tehran. According to three Iranian officials, two Iraqi intelligence sources and two Western intelligence sources, Iran has transferred short-range ballistic missiles to allies in Iraq over the last few months. Five of the officials said it was helping those groups to start making their own.

2018-09-02,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s sovereign fund has named Andrew Liveris, the former chairman and chief executive of Dow Chemical, as a special adviser, in its highest-profile appointment of any global manufacturing executive.  Liveris will work closely with the Public Investment Fund (PIF) on matters of strategic importance, assist the fund in efforts to boost the value of its portfolio, and ensure the contribution of PIF companies to Saudi Arabia’s economic vision program 2030, the fund said in a statement on Sunday. His appointment comes as the PIF, chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is negotiating the sale of its majority stake in Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) 2010.SE to oil company Aramco. Liveris joined the Aramco board on July 1. The PIF said Liveris had extensive experience working in Saudi Arabia over the last two decades and under his leadership, Dow DuPont worked with Aramco to develop the Sadara Chemical petrochemical complex. The PIF, which manages more than $250 billion in assets, aims to increase its asset portfolio to $400 billion by 2020. More than half of its assets are tied up in large Saudi companies, but the PIF has also made substantial overseas commitments. This included a $45 billion agreement to invest in a giant tech fund led by Japan’s Softbank [9984.T] and another $20 billion committed to an infrastructure investment fund planned with Blackstone (BX.N).

2018-09-02,"(Repeats with no changes) * Bankers disappointed after months preparing Aramco IPO deal * Some bankers moved to other projects in Saudi Arabia * Privatisation programme still expected to raise up to $11 bln By Saeed Azhar, Hadeel Al Sayegh and Clara Denina DUBAI/LONDON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Investment banks which lost out on big payouts for the work on the shelved listing of oil giant Aramco are lining up for a raft of other projects as Saudi Arabia pursues reforms. Banks including JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley worked for months to prepare what would have been the biggest ever stock market debut. But the plan to sell 5 percent of the company for a targeted $100 billion was pulled. The bankers were paid retainer fees but were expecting around $200 million would be shared among all the banks involved when the deal was done. Now, they are pinning their hopes on other projects from a privatisation programme that is part of Riyadh’s economic reform plan to loosen its reliance on oil. Without the funds from the Aramco sale, the government is looking to raise money in other ways, creating new opportunities for the banks, bankers say. Teams from JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley that worked on the IPO, have been shifted to advise on Aramco’ planned acquisition of up to $70 billion in petrochemicals firm Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC), three people familiar with the details of the transaction told Reuters. HSBC, which was also an adviser on the Aramco IPO, is expected to play a role in putting together the debt to fund that purchase, they said. One of the sources said the issue could exceed the 2016 sovereign bond issue of $17.5 billion, which was a record for the kingdom. Aramco said earlier this month it was in “very early-stage discussions” with the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) to acquire the stake in SABIC but has not said how it will finance the deal. Spokespeople for JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and HSBC declined to comment on their role in the Sabic deal. None of those banks have confirmed they were involved in the Aramco IPO. Other deals are expected to be forthcoming. “The PIF (sovereign wealth fund) has had to reconsider its budget in the last three months, after finding out that they wouldn’t be getting $100 billion from the Aramco IPO right away,” said a banker in Saudi Arabia. “So there’s been a flurry of activity as they look to raise cash in other ways. A lot of these are smaller deals, $1 billion here and there, but all geared toward financing their commitments for big infrastructure projects without slowing down their timelines.” The banker did not give details of the other deals. PIF officials did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. After Reuters reported last week that the Aramco deal had been shelved, Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the government was committed to conducting the IPO at an unspecified date in the future. The bankers are nevertheless wary after the Aramco experience. It highlighted the hurdles of doing business in a country governed by an absolute monarchy where public protest and political parties are banned. It also added to uncertainty after scores of top royals, ministers and businessmen were rounded up in an anti-corruption campaign last November. The preparation for the listing was launched by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman two years ago and some bankers had flown to the kingdom hundreds of times to work in the Dhahran camp, a gated compound for the oil group’s residents. A different source said Aramco had demanded it deal only with the very top bankers. Another person familiar with the Aramco deal said he had made more than 20 trips to Dhahran over 18 months but with little to show for it. He said his team would “give the same presentation each time without getting much feedback.” Bankers also say the fees are modest in comparison to those paid by other countries. “The deal flow is huge but there’s a worry that the fees coming from these projects are low,” said a Gulf-based banker who spoke on conditions of anonymity. “Saudi Arabia is lower than Hong Kong and Dubai when it comes to fees,” he said. “It’s all substandard.” Typical fees for banks doing IPOs in more developed markets are around 1 percent of the overall deal while estimates from bankers and analysts for an Aramco IPO was 0.2 percent. The 35 banks who worked on Chinese internet giant Alibaba’s $21.8 billion float, led by six main underwriters, pocketed an estimated $300 million among them, according to Thomson Reuters data. Still, the rewards from a privatisation that analysts expect to generate ($9 billion to $11 billion) by 2020 are too big for bankers to ignore. HSBC is already advising Saudi International Petrochemical Company on a potential merger with Sahara Petrochemical, which is being advised by Morgan Stanley, according to disclosures from March. U.S. bank Citigroup obtained a license to conduct capital markets business in Saudi Arabia last year after an absence of almost 13 years. Moelis is preparing to apply for an advisory license in Saudi Arabia and U.S. boutique investment bank Evercore opened an office in Dubai in 2017. The government is also trying to make it easier to do deals, changing the law to allow alternatives to traditional debt finance. “There are plenty of deals to be made from bigger players looking to consolidate their market position and buy out competitors,” said Mohammed Fahmi, the Dubai-based co-Head of EFG Hermes Investment Banking. “Good stories will continue to see a following.” (Additional reporting by Dasha Afanasieva in London and Katie Paul in Dubai; editing by John O’Donnell and Anna Willard)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/saudi-aramco-deals/rpt-bruised-bankers-seek-consolation-prizes-after-shelved-aramco-ipo-idUKL8N1VM2WL,02 Sep 2018,"* Bankers disappointed after months preparing Aramco IPO
