2018-04-14,"LIMA, April 14 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Saturday backed air strikes on Syria’s chemical weapons program by the United States and its allies, but Argentina, Brazil and Peru at a summit in Lima voiced caution about escalating military action. Addressing regional leaders at the Summit of the Americas in Peru, Trudeau and several other leaders across the Western Hemisphere condemned the use of chemical weapons. “Those responsible must be brought to justice,” Trudeau said in a plenary session. But Washington’s retaliatory strikes drew pleas for caution from Latin American countries. “There’s deep concern in Brasil with the escalation of military conflict in Syria. It’s time to find permanent solutions based in the international law to a war that has been going for far too long and ended too many lives,” Brazilian President Michel Temer said in the plenary. Peru, a non-permanent member of the United Nations security council, called for moderation from all parties involved and said it backed a “political solution,” according to a statement from the foreign ministry. Argentine President Mauricio Macri also called for the international community to seek to avoid flaming tensions further and to work “in the framework of existing international commitments.” The official theme of the Summit of the Americas is the fight against corruption. Many countries in attendance are also expected to condemn a pending election in Venezuela. But Syria, China and trade loomed over the talks on Saturday as Washington seeks to advance the agenda of U.S. President Donald Trump, which is widely unpopular in the region. Trump canceled his attendance at the summit to focus on Syria. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who is filling in for him, is expected to discuss Syria in his speech on Saturday and in meetings with heads of state. The Pentagon said on Saturday that U.S. strikes in Syria overnight had successfully hit every target and were aimed to deliver an unambiguous signal to the Syrian government and deter the future use of chemical weapons.

2018-04-14,"(Adds ChemChina comment, details) LONDON, April 14 (Reuters) - Global energy trader Mercuria Group has agreed to take an interest in the oil refining system of China’s ChemChina, sources familiar with the matter said. As part of the deal, state-run ChemChina would increase its stake in Mercuria, one of the world’s largest oil trading firms. ChemChina already holds a 12 percent stake in the Swiss-based company and would remain a minority shareholder. The deal, if completed, would be the first time a global trading house has gained a stake in Chinese refineries. ChemChina operates the country’s largest refining assets outside state oil majors. It has total crude processing capacity of 530,000 bpd, including three plants in eastern Shandong province. “ChemChina will inject assets into Mercuria...(which) include some stakes in several Shandong-based refineries,” said one source briefed on the matter. Two sources added that as part of the deal Mercuria may also participate in ChemChina’s global trading operations. A ChemChina media official did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The deal, agreed in Beijing, would give Mercuria its first stake in crude refining to go alongside its interests in oil transport, storage and upstream operations.

2018-04-14,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria’s economy will improve this year, Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia said on Saturday, as revenue from the OPEC member’s oil and natural gas exports picks up after falling by half since 2014. “2017 has been a difficult year, but 2018 will be much better,” Ouyahia told reporters, adding that unemployment had risen to 11.7 percent last year. Oil and natural gas exports increased 25 percent to $7.1 billion in the first two months of 2018, up from $5.67 billion in the same period a year earlier, according to official data. Algeria is a major gas supplier to Europe and relies heavily on revenue from energy exports. They account for 95 percent of its total exports and 60 percent of the state budget. To cut down spending, the North African country wants to reform, with the help of the World Bank, its subsidy system offering cheap petrol, power and housing to citizens. “Our subsidy policy is to be corrected, but underprivileged sections will not be victims of this revision,” Ouyahia said. “The middle class will be protected and the state will not give up on low-income citizens,” he said, adding that the reforms would not be implemented this year. He also said agricultural production would improve due to better rains.  Ouyahia also confirmed he will not run in next year’s presidential election as speculation grows that veteran President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, 81, will seek a fifth term. Bouteflika, in office sine 1999, has largely disappeared from public view since suffering a stroke in 2013. “We can only be proud if the president decides to run,” said Ouyahia, who leads the pro-government National Rally for Democracy (RND) party. In a possible sign that authorities are paving the way for    a fifth term, Ouyahia said a campaign would be launched to showcase the president’s achievements. “It is important ... to show where the $1,000 billion (in energy revenues) were spent during four terms,” Ouyahia said. Bouteflika can also count on the support of the ruling party FLN, and thousands of former fighters who have accepted a partial amnesty offer to lay down arms ending a civil war with Islamists in the 1990s.

2018-04-14,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China aims to establish a free trade zone in Hainan by 2020 and will encourage multinationals to set up their international and regional headquarters there, as part of plans to open up the province’s economy to foreign investors.  The guidance, published on the government’s official website, was jointly issued by the ruling Communist Party and State Council. It comes after President Xi Jinping announced on Friday that the country would grant foreign firms greater economic freedom in the southernmost province. Known for its sandy beaches and resort-lined coast, Hainan is the headquarters of China’s aviation-to-financial services conglomerate HNA. This week, the province hosted the Boao Forum - Asia’s equivalent of Davos. The document said that the government would set up an investment fund to support the building of a free trade port in Hainan by 2025, with the aim that the system will become “mature” by 2035.  It will phase out sales of traditionally fuelled vehicles for greater environmental conservation in Hainan, and encourage foreign firms to participate in the building of the port.  It will also allow sports lottery games as well as horse-racing as part of plans to promote the development of the province’s tourism industry.  Bloomberg reported in February that China was considering allowing sports betting or a lottery on Hainan in a move that could open the door to physical casinos.

2018-04-14,"(New throughout, adds details on targets of strikes) By Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali WASHINGTON, April 14 (Reuters) - The United States said on Saturday it overwhelmed and evaded Syrian air defenses overnight to strike every target at the heart of Syria’s chemical weapons program, in a multi-pronged attack from the air and sea alongside British and French allies. Although the operation was secretly unfolding for hours before the first impact, it only took minutes from the first to the last detonation from 105 precision-guided missile strikes on three Syrian chemical weapons targets, officials said. Marine Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie, director of the Joint Staff, rejected assertions from Russia and Syria that scores of the Western missiles were shot down. He said Russian air defenses did not fire, while Syrian air defenses were completely ineffective against an attack from multiple directions involving not just U.S., British and French aircraft but also U.S. naval destroyers, a cruiser and French frigate and even a U.S. submarine. The Syrian air defenses not only missed the incoming missiles but they kept firing even after the last U.S., British and French strikes were complete. Some of those more than 40 Syrian missile interceptors, he suggested, might have hit civilian targets. “When you shoot iron into the sky without guidance, it will inevitably fall to earth,” McKenzie told reporters. Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White warned that Russia was actively attempting to sow confusion about the attack. “The Russian disinformation campaign has already begun. There has been a 2,000 percent increase in Russian trolls in the last 24 hours,” White said. The prime target of the operation was the Barza Research and Development Center in the greater Damascus area, which McKenzie noted was “one of the most heavily defended aerospace areas in the world.” Barza took the brunt of the fire, with 57 Tomahawk cruise missiles and 19 Joint Air to Surface Stand-off missiles. Though some of Syria’s chemical weapons infrastructure was still left, “I think we’ve dealt them a severe blow,” McKenzie said, adding it would set the program back for years. Despite severely damaging the infrastructure with the strikes, McKenzie said the Pentagon would not rule out that the Assad government still had capability to use such weapons again. “There’s still a residual element of the Syrian program that’s out there,” he said. “I’m not going to say that they’re going to be unable to continue to conduct a chemical attack in the future. I suspect, however, they’ll think long and hard about it.” (Reporting by Phil Stewart, Idrees Ali and Doina Chiacu; writing by Jeff Mason; Editing by David Gregorio)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-syria-pentagon/update-2-u-s-strikes-cripple-syrias-chemical-weapons-ability-pentagon-idUKL1N1RR0CK,14 Apr 2018,"The United States said on

2018-04-14,"CARACAS (Reuters) - President Nicolas Maduro has decreed extra powers to his oil czar Manuel Quevedo to try and halt sliding crude output in crisis-hit Venezuela, which has sunk to its lowest level since the 1950s.  Struggling with a deep economic recession, failed socialist policies, debt default, and U.S. financial sanctions, Venezuela’s crude production slipped to 1.586 million barrels per day in February, according to OPEC. Maduro’s decree, seen by Reuters, gives Quevedo, a major general, powers to “create, annul or modify” deals involving state energy company PDVSA and its subsidiaries. The oil minister is also head of PDVSA. It was not immediately clear what that might mean for PDVSA’s joint ventures. But Quevedo met late on Friday with some foreign partners including representatives of Total (TOTF.PA), Statoil STL.OL, Chevron (CVX.N), Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC). In a statement, PDVSA said the new measure would enable a reorganization of operations and minimization of bureaucracy.  “We are going to work with PDVSA to implement the measures and increase production,” Rosneft representative Pavel Kamenets was quoted as saying in the PDVSA statement.  The decree creates a “special regime” in the sector until Dec. 31, with the possibility of a year’s extension. “The Oil Minister will be able to ... establish norms and special contract procedures for products, assets and services,” it said. One clause ordered all specialized personnel, on national or international assignments, to return to original workplaces. Socialist leader Maduro has promised a vast anti-corruption purge to cleanse the oil industry of “mafias”.  At least 70 executives have been detained in recent months, panicking PDVSA workers, depriving the industry of much of its top brass and stalling decision-making in the company overseeing the world’s biggest crude reserves, insiders have said. The opposition dismisses the probe as a power struggle within government, noting that the industry has been under tight control of the Socialist Party since early in former president Hugo Chavez’s 14-year rule.

2018-04-14,"DAKAR (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund said it was resuming loan disbursements to Chad after the Central African oil producer reached an agreement in principal to restructure its more than $1 billion debt to Glencore (GLEN.L) and four banks. Glencore and the banks lent Chad’s state oil firm about $1.45 billion in 2014 to be repaid with crude oil cargoes but global oil prices crashed shortly thereafter. The debt has eaten up nearly all of Chad’s oil profits — its main source of revenue — prompting tense negotiations that began last year about restructuring.  The agreement struck in February extends the maturity of the debt and provides a two-year grace period on principal payments.  The IMF approved about $300 million in credit to Chad at the end of June and initially released $48.8 million. But a decision on the next disbursement was delayed as the government’s talks with its creditors dragged on. In a statement late on Friday, the IMF said it would immediately disburse about $51 million. Mitsuhiro Furusawa, the Fund’s deputy managing director, said the February deal “is expected to yield the necessary financing for the programme and firmly restore external debt stability”.  The IMF also said it expects Chad’s economy to grow by 3.5 percent this year, after it contracted by 3.1 percent last year, assuming the terms of the agreement are implemented.

2018-04-14,"YEREVAN, April 14 (Reuters) - Armenia’s ruling Republican party nominated former President Serzh Sarksyan as its candidate for prime minister on Saturday, drawing renewed criticism from opponents who accuse Sarksyan of engineering a power grab. Sarksyan’s ally Armen Sarkissian, a former prime minister and ambassador to Britain, was sworn in as president on Monday after being elected by parliament in a vote that was meant to herald the start of a power shift to the premier and parliament. Under the terms of an amended constitution approved in 2015 by referendum, the presidency will become largely ceremonial. “The (party’s) council discussed this issue and unanimously supported (Sarksyan’s) candidacy,” the Republicans said in a statement. Parliament, which is dominated by the ruling party, is due to make a final decision on April 17. The Dashnaktsutsiun Party, the Republicans ruling coalition ally, also backs Sarksyan’s candidacy, meaning he should easily secure the simple majority needed for election. No other candidates are running. Opposition leaders have accused Sarksyan of changing the nation’s political system to ensure he can remain in power, and have been holding protest rallies in recent weeks. Sarksyan, who became president in 2008, had denied any intention of becoming premier until March, when he said his appointment would allow him to share the benefit of his experience. Hundreds of opposition protesters marched in the centre of the capital, Yerevan, on Saturday, waving national flags and chanting: “Make a stand, say “No” to Serzh!” Armenia, a country of around three million people in the southern Caucasus, seceded from the Soviet Union in 1991, but remains dependent on Russia for aid and investment. Many Armenians accuse the government of corruption and mismanaging the economy.

2018-04-14,"(Adds context) BAGHDAD, April 14 (Reuters) - Air strikes carried out by the United States, France and Britain against Syrian military targets could give terrorism an opportunity to expand in the region, the Iraqi foreign ministry said on Saturday. The air strikes marked a “a very dangerous development”, the ministry said in statement. “Such action could have dangerous consequences, threatening the security and stability of the region and giving terrorism another opportunity to expand after it was ousted from Iraq and forced into Syria to retreat to a large extent,” it said. The ministry called on Arab leaders to discuss the situation at a summit due to be held in Saudi Arabia on Sunday. Iraq’s position is in line with those of Russia and Iran, the main backers of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the civil war which has raged in his country since 2011. The United States, France and Britain have accused Assad of attacking the Douma suburb of Damascus with chemical agents on April 7. They say the air strikes on Saturday had been aimed at deterring his further use of chemical weapons. Shi’ite-led Iraq has kept good relations with Assad’s government and Iran, while also receiving massive military and financial support from the United States, Britain and France. A U.S-led military coalition provided key air and ground support to the Iraqi government forces last year to recapture Mosul and other cities seized by Islamic State in 2014. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi last month said he wants “to keep away” from the conflict between the United States and Iran.

2018-04-14,"PARIS (Reuters) - France has concluded after analysing “reliable intelligence” and open sources that a chemical attack on Douma on April 7 was carried out by Syrian government forces, a declassified intelligence report showed on Saturday.  “On the intelligence collected by our services, and in the absence to date of chemical samples analysed by our own laboratories, France considers, beyond possible doubt, a chemical attack was carried out against civilians at Douma ... and that there is no plausible scenario other than that of an attack by Syrian armed forces,” the report said.  It was released after coordinated air strikes by Britain, France and the United States on Syrian government targets overnight.  “After examining the videos and images of victims published online, they (intelligence services) were able to conclude with a high degree of confidence that the vast majority are recent and not fabricated,” the report said. It said no deaths from mechanical injuries were visible and all symptoms were characteristic of a chemical weapons attack, particularly choking agents and organophosphorus agents or hydrocyanic acid. “Reliable intelligence indicates that Syrian military officials have coordinated what appears to be the use of chemical weapons containing chlorine on Douma, on April 7,” it said. It gave no other details on the intelligence.  The report, which provided a broad outline of the Syrian government-backed offensive supported by Russia on the eastern Ghouta region over recent months, also said French services had assessed that not all Syrian government chemical stockpiles and capacities had been declared to the U.N.  Syria had omitted to declare many of the activities of its Scientific Studies and Research Centre (SSRC), the report said. It said Syria had not answered questions on matters including possible remaining stocks of yperite (mustard gas) and DF (a sarin precursor), undeclared chemical weapons of small calibre and signs VX and sarin on production and loading sites.

2018-04-14,"(Corrects name of Russian ambassador in paragraph 10) By Steve Holland and Tom Perry WASHINGTON/BEIRUT, April 14 (Reuters) - U.S., British and French forces pounded Syria with air strikes early on Saturday in response to a poison gas attack that killed dozens of people last week, in the biggest intervention by Western powers against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. U.S. President Donald Trump announced the military action from the White House. As he spoke, explosions rocked Damascus. British Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron said their forces had joined in the attack. With more than 100 missiles fired from ships and manned aircraft, the allies struck three of Syria’s main chemical weapons facilities, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Joseph Dunford said. Mattis called the strikes a “one time shot,” but Trump raised the prospect of further strikes if Assad’s government again uses chemical weapons. “We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents,” the U.S. president said in a televised address. The Syrian conflict pits a complex myriad of parties against each other with Russia and Iran giving Assad military and political help while fractured opposition forces have had varying levels of support at different times from the West, Arab states and Turkey. The strikes risked raising tension in an already combustible region but appeared designed not to trigger a military response from Russia and Iran. Nevertheless, Assad’s government and Russia both responded angrily. “Again, we are being threatened. We warned that such actions will not be left without consequences,” Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, said on Twitter. Syrian state media said the attack would fail and called it a “flagrant violation of international law.” It was unclear if the strikes will deter Assad from again using chemical weapons. They seemed unlikely to have much impact on the balance of power in Syria’s seven-year-old civil war, in which Assad’s government has steadily gained the upper hand against armed opponents since Russia intervened in 2015. Trump had tough words for Assad and his suspected role in last week’s chemical weapons attack. “These are not the actions of a man. They are crimes of a monster,” he said. At least six loud explosions were heard in Damascus and smoke was seen rising over the city, a Reuters witness said. A second witness said the Barzah district of Damascus had been hit in the strikes. Barzah is the location of a major Syrian scientific research center. A senior official in a regional alliance that backs Damascus told Reuters that said the Syrian government and its allies had “absorbed” the attack, and that targeted sites were evacuated days ago thanks to a warning from Russia. State-controlled Syrian TV said Syrian air defenses shot down 13 missiles fired in the U.S.-led attack. The Russian defence ministry said none of the rockets launched had entered zones where Russian air defense systems are protecting facilities in Tartus and Hmeimim. The combined U.S., British and French assault appeared to be more intense than a similar strike Trump ordered almost exactly a year ago against a Syrian air base in retaliation for an earlier chemical weapons attack that Washington attributed to Assad. The targets included a Syrian center in the greater Damascus area for the research, development, production and testing of chemical and biological weaponry as well as a chemical weapons storage facility near the city of Homs. A third target, also near Homs, contained both a chemical weapons equipment storage facility and a command post. At a Pentagon briefing, Dunford said the air strikes on Saturday were planned to minimize the risk of casualties among Russia’s forces in Syria. Mattis acknowledged that the United States conducted the air strikes only with conclusive evidence that chlorine gas was used in the April 7 attack in Syria. Evidence that the nerve agent sarin also was used is inconclusive, he said. Allegations of Assad’s chlorine use are frequent in Syria’s conflict, raising questions about whether Washington had lowered the threshold for military action in Syria by now deciding to strike after a chlorine gas attack. Mattis, who U.S. officials said had earlier warned in internal debates that too large an attack would risk confrontation with Russia, described the strikes as a one-off to dissuade Assad from “doing this again.” But a U.S. official familiar with the military planning said there could be more air strikes if the intelligence indicates that Assad has not stopped manufacturing, importing, storing or using chemical weapons, including weaponized chlorine. The official acknowledged that could require a more sustained U.S. air and naval presence in the region, as well as intensified satellite and other surveillance of Syria. Trump, however, has been leery of U.S. military involvement in the Middle East, and is eager to withdraw roughly 2,000 troops who are in Syria as part of the battle against Islamic State militants. The air strikes, however, risk dragging the United States further into Syria’s civil war, particularly if Russia, Iran and Assad opt to retaliate. “America does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria, under no circumstances,” Trump said in his eight-minute address. “The purpose of our actions tonight is to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread and use of chemical weapons,” he said. The U.S. president, who has tried to build good relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, had sharply critical words for Russia and Iran over their support of Assad. “To Iran and to Russia, I ask, what kind of a nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of innocent men, women and children?” Trump said. May said she had authorized British armed forces “to conduct coordinated and targeted strikes to degrade the Syrian regime’s chemical weapons capability.” She described it as a “limited and targeted strike” aimed at minimizing civilian casualties. Macron said: “We cannot tolerate the employment of chemical weapons.” Last year, the United States fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles from the guided missile destroyers USS Porter and the USS Ross that struck the Shayrat air base. The targets of that strike included Syrian aircraft, aircraft shelters, petroleum and logistical storage facilities, ammunition supply bunkers, air defense systems and radar. At the time, the Pentagon said that a fifth of Syria’s operational aircraft were either damaged or destroyed. The U.S.-led attack on Syria will be seen as limited if it is now over and there is no second round of strikes, said a senior official in the regional alliance that has supported President Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian war. “If it is finished, and there is no second round, it will be considered limited,” the official told Reuters.

2018-04-14,"SYDNEY, April 14 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp will proceed with the second stage of its giant Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant off the northwest coast of Western Australia, the company said on Saturday. Chevron and its joint venture partners plan to sink 11 new wells in the Gorgon and Jansz-Io fields and build offshore pipelines and subsea structures to pipe the gas to the nearby 15.6 million tonne a year LNG plant on Barrow Island. The $54 billion Gorgon project came on stream in March 2016 but suffered numerous unplanned shutdowns in its early stages. Chevron declined to put a cost on stage two of the project, but a spokesman said the development would fit within its planned annual investment of $18 billion to $20 billion through 2020. Drilling should start next year and the full expansion could take about four years, a source with knowledge of the plans said. Seven new wells will be drilled thousands of metres below sea level in the Gorgon field while four will be sunk in the Jansz-Io field, about 70 km (44 miles) further out to sea. Gorgon Stage Two is part of the original Gorgon development plan which includes the expansion of the subsea gas network required to maintain long-term natural gas supply to Barrow Island. “Through ongoing collaboration, we need to invest in both the infrastructure and the local skills and capability required to maintain our long-term energy position and contribute to the jobs of the future,” Chevron Australia managing director Nigel Hearne said in a statement. “Benefits are expected to flow through to Australian industry, arising from local project management, drilling and completion activities and subsea infrastructure installation.” Chevron is the Gorgon project operator and holds a controlling 47.3 percent, while ExxonMobil and Shell each have a 25 percent stake. The remaining stakes are held by Osaka Gas, Tokyo Gas and JERA. Chevron also leads the development of the Wheatstone natural gas project, manages a one-sixth interest in the North West Shelf Venture and operates Australia’s largest onshore oilfield on Barrow Island.
