2018-09-04,"BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Five protesters were killed and 16 more were injured during a second day of clashes with security forces in Iraq’s main southern city Basra, local health and security sources said. Twenty-two members of the security forces were also wounded, some by a hand grenade, the sources said, in some of the worst unrest reported during months of protests sweeping the long neglected south, heartland of Iraq’s Shi’ite Muslim majority. Protesters are angry over electricity outages during the hot Iraqi summer, a lack of jobs and proper government services and entrenched corruption. Basra residents say salt seeping into the water supply has made it undrinkable and sent hundreds to hospital, proof, they say, that infrastructure has been allowed to collapse in the part of the country that produces most of its oil wealth. As the clashes continued to unfold, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi convened an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the unrest and ordered the Interior Ministry to conduct an immediate investigation into the protests, state media reported. Hundreds of people gathered at local government buildings, hurled petrol bombs and stones and attempted to block roads leading to the building for a second night. Some protesters stormed one of the provincial government buildings and set it alight.  Security forces fired live rounds in the air as well as teargas to try to disperse the crowd, local sources said. Smoke could be seen billowing from the outer perimeter of the provincial government headquarters, where many had gathered earlier on Tuesday to mourn a protester who died on Monday night, Yasser Makki. The crowds near the government buildings had largely dispersed by 11 p.m., after a citywide curfew was imposed by the city’s security officials.  Iraq’s second biggest city, Basra is a stronghold of Moqtada al-Sadr, a Shi’ite cleric and former leader of anti-American sectarian militia who has recast himself as an anti-corruption campaigner.  In a tweet, Sadr appeared to back the protesters, condemning the tactics used by some members of the security forces against who he said were “unarmed demonstrators who only want to live with dignity”.   The public anger has swelled at a time when politicians are struggling to form a new government after an inconclusive parliamentary election in May. Iraq’s top Shi’ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani has expressed support for the protests. Earlier on Tuesday, mourners carried Makki’s body near the building, chanting “Yasser’s blood will not be lost”. They damaged the gate of the local government building but were dispersed by security forces using teargas before they could enter it. Earlier on Tuesday, Abadi had ordered an investigation into Makki’s death during his weekly press conference. “Our orders are clear in banning the firing of live ammunition during demonstrations,” Abadi said. He suspended the electricity minister last month, saying his government had begun punishing those responsible for poor services in Basra.

Emerging markets stocks and currencies were under added pressure on concerns about inflation in Turkey and after data showed South Africa had slumped into recession in the second quarter. U.S. President Donald Trump could follow through on plans to impose levies on $200 billion more of Chinese imports after a public comment period on his proposed new tariffs on Chinese goods is set to end on Thursday. Also U.S.-Canada trade talks were expected to resume on Wednesday after the last round ended on Friday with no deal to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump has told Congress he would sign a bilateral trade pact with Mexico. “You have issues concerning NAFTA and China trade issues. You also have a storm in the Gulf of Mexico.

MSCI’s emerging market stocks index was down 0.8 percent on track for its fifth straight day of declines. The U.S. dollar rose broadly and investors shunned emerging market currencies as concerns about the U.S.-China trade situation boosted safe-haven demand for the greenback. In currencies, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies,  rose 0.27 percent, with the euro down 0.32 percent to $1.1586. The Canadian dollar weakened to a six-week low against its U.S. counterpart amid an uncertain outlook for Canada’s trading arrangement with the United States. The Canadian dollar fell 0.64 percent versus the greenback at 1.32 per dollar. The dollar gained 3.3 percent on the South African rand , and 1 percent against Turkey’s Lira. A JPMorgan emerging market currency index fell to its lowest since May 2017. The Mexican peso also slipped against the dollar. “We are just waiting for something to turn the EM (emerging market) sentiment because the valuations look really attractive, but it’s just a slow meltdown at the moment,” said Standard Life Aberdeen EM portfolio manager Viktor Szabo.

2018-09-04,"(Adds Talos Energy, broker quote on impact) HOUSTON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Three more oil producers pulled employees out of Tropical Storm Gordon’s path, and companies cut 9 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil and gas production on Tuesday as the storm churned toward an expected nighttime landfall. The storm, which is expected to strengthen into a Category 1 hurricane with winds of at least 74 miles per hour (119 kph), shifted eastward, reducing its threat to producers on the western side of the Gulf and most Gulf Coast refineries. Companies evacuated 54 offshore platforms and halted 156,907 barrels per day of oil production and 232 million cubic feet per day of natural gas output, according to estimates by the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. Offshore oil production accounts for 17 percent of total U.S. oil production and 5 percent of natural gas production. Talos Energy Inc, Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp on Tuesday evacuated employees and shut in several platforms in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Talos halted output at its Ram Powell, Amberjack and Pompano platforms, Exxon its Lena platform and Chevron Corp curtailed its Petronius platform. That followed Anadarko Petroleum Corp’s decision on Monday to evacuate staff and shut production at two oil platforms in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Other major oil producers, including ConocoPhillips, BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, said they continued to operate and were monitoring conditions. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, the largest privately owned crude terminal in the United States, also said it was operating normally. U.S. and global crude futures were up a fraction as traders said they did not expect the storm to have long-term impact on Gulf output. The storm’s potential threat also was overshadowed by a strong dollar and storage data that showed rising production, traders said. “We have a lot of shut-ins. A couple rigs, a couple ports are closed to incoming vessels,” one broker said. “But right now it is a Category 1 (hurricane). I can’t see why that scares anyone.” The ports of Gulfport and Pascagoula, Mississippi, and Mobile, Alabama, were closed to all traffic on Tuesday, the U.S. Coast said in a statement. New Orleans-area ports were operating under an advisory that called for gale-force winds within 24 hours. Reporting by Jessica Resnick-Ault, Scott Disavino, Devika

2018-09-04,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - The drought-causing El Nino weather phenomenon will return to Colombia in November, the country’s environment minister said on Tuesday, warning that agriculture, energy production and water provision could be affected by the predicted lack of rain. El Nino, a warming of ocean surface temperatures associated with crop damage, fires and flash floods, has damaged coffee and banana crops in Colombia in recent years and also contributed to a spike in food prices that stoked inflation figures. The Andean country, which generates 75 percent of its electricity via hydroelectric dams, was nearly forced to ration energy during the most recent El Nino, which lasted from the second half of 2015 through April 2016. The phenomenon is expected to extend into the first quarter of 2019, Environment Minister Ricardo Lozano told journalists, and grow worse then. “There will be a precipitation reduction, there will be drought,” Lozano said. “That will directly affect those that supply water: aqueducts, the energy sector, in the health sector, irrigation areas.” Colombia’s electricity generation is guaranteed despite the phenomenon, Angela Montoya, the head of the country’s electric energy generators association said.  Reservoirs that supply hydroelectric dams will be at 70 percent capacity in November, Montoya said, and will work in tandem with thermal coal power stations. Colombia currently has the capacity to generate some 17,500 megawatts, though it consumes only 13,000 MW.

2018-09-04,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed on Tuesday, as energy infrastructure on the U.S. Gulf Coast braced for a hurricane, but gains were capped as a stronger dollar and report of rising stockpiles at the Cushing, Oklahoma hub weighed.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose 7 cents to settle at $69.87 a barrel after earlier hitting a session high of $71.40. U.S. markets were closed on Monday for Labor Day.  Brent crude LCOc1, which traded on Monday, was ended 2 cents firmer to settle at $78.17 a barrel, down from a session high of $79.72. Both benchmarks jumped earlier in the session as more oil producers pulled employees out of Tropical Storm Gordon’s path and shut-in 9 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil and gas production on Tuesday. But the storm, expected to make a nighttime landfall as a category 1 hurricane, shifted eastward, reducing its threat to major production areas and most Gulf Coast refineries.  Vessel traffic along the U.S. Gulf Coast was also under restrictions ahead of Gordon.  The Gulf of Mexico is home to 17 percent of U.S. crude oil production and 5 percent of natural gas output daily, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. On land, the Gulf Coast serves as a major U.S. refining hub.  Prices moved lower, however, as market participants saw the market as overbought. “Initial reaction this morning appeared exaggerated as disruption to Gulf of Mexico production infrastructure isn’t likely to extract a major amount of crude from the market,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. “The larger impact of the storm is apt to fall on Gulf coast refinery activity that could be affected by power outages.” Weighing on oil prices, Cushing, Oklahoma, crude inventories rose nearly 754,000 barrels from Aug. 24 to Friday, traders said, citing a report from market intelligence firm Genscape. A rising U.S. dollar index .DXY also pushed crude futures lower. A stronger dollar makes greenback-denominated oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.

Investors anticipate less supply from Iran as U.S. sanctions on Tehran begin to bite. Harry Tchilinguirian, oil strategist at BNP Paribas, warned of “supply issues” into 2019. “Crude oil export losses from Iran due to U.S. sanctions, production decline in Venezuela and episodic outages in Libya are unlikely to be offset entirely by corresponding rises in OPEC+ production,” Tchilinguirian said.

2018-09-04,"UREÑA, Venezuela (Reuters) - Frustrated Venezuelan drivers faced lengthy lines for gasoline in border states on Tuesday as the government struggled to roll out a new payment system that President Nicolas Maduro says will reduce smuggling of heavily-subsidized fuel.  Maduro says the payment system will pave the way for charging international prices for fuel - a massive increase given that gas is now almost free - as his government seeks to shore up state coffers amid a hyperinflationary economic meltdown. Any increase would mark the first time in 20 years that the OPEC member has significantly raised domestic fuel prices, which have been a sensitive issue ever since deadly riots broke out in 1989 in response to austerity measures that included higher gasoline prices.  The pilot program that began on Tuesday in eight states was supposed to provide service stations with wireless devices that use a state-backed identification document called the Fatherland Card to carry out fuel transactions. “I see a lot of disorganization because they haven’t started making this work yet,” said Jose Coronel, 26, a civil servant, as he waited in line at a gas station in the border town of Ureña. “I can see that it’s difficult to control smuggling.”  At gas stations along the border with neighboring Colombia, the new machines were either not installed or not functioning properly, according to drivers filling up their tanks and two gas station attendants in two different states. The new payment system will provide a subsidy to motorists with a Fatherland Card, directly reimbursing them for gasoline purchases, once the domestic fuel price hikes take effect.  Maduro says that will help soften the impact of a steep price increase. Drivers on the border started lining up as early as Monday afternoon on concerns that the price hikes would be immediate or that stations would run out of fuel. The Information Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Experts estimate Venezuela - where shortages of food and medicine have fueled hunger, disease and a mass exodus of citizens - loses at least $5 billion per year as a result of not selling gasoline at international prices. Maduro on Monday said gasoline would rise to international price levels by October, without offering details. The use of the Fatherland Card has drawn intense criticism from government critics, who say it is a mechanism to gather information about citizens that the ruling Socialist Party can use against adversaries by withholding basic services from them.  The government offers some benefits including subsidized food, access to scarce medicine and cash bonuses to holders of the card. Maduro says it will help combat an “economic war” led by opposition politicians with the help of Washington.  Fuel prices have stayed relatively steady for years even though inflation is projected by the IMF to reach 1,000,000 percent.  Unay Bayona, 24, an independent merchant, said he doubted prices would ever rise enough to match those in Colombia, and that residents would continue to view contraband as an option.  “Smuggling is going to continue because there is no other way to make a living,” Bayona said, at the entrance to a service station in Ureña.

2018-09-04,"(Corrects to say U.S. has pushed the U.N. to call out Iran, not add sanctions on Iran, paragraph 2) By Michelle Nichols UNITED NATIONS, Sept 4 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will chair a United Nations Security Council meeting on Iran this month during the annual gathering of world leaders in New York, diplomats and U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said on Tuesday. The United States, which holds the council presidency for September, has unsuccessfully pushed the U.N. to call out Iran. Haley has regularly attacked Iran, accusing it of meddling in the wars in Syria and Yemen. Diplomats said Iran could request to speak at the Sept. 26 council meeting, the week of the U.N. General Assembly. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is expected to address the assembly on Sept. 25. The Iranian U.N. mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. During a rare public meeting on Tuesday to discuss the proposed U.S. agenda for the council, Russia’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said the Iran meeting should focus on the implementation of a 2015 resolution on Iran. “We very much hope that there will be views voiced in connection with the U.S. withdrawal” from a 2015 international nuclear deal, Polyanskiy told the council. Trump in May withdrew from the accord between Iran and six world powers aimed at stalling Tehran’s nuclear capabilities in return for lifting some sanctions. Trump ordered the reimposition of U.S. sanctions suspended under the deal. Iran is still subject to a U.N. arms embargo and other restrictions contained in the 2015 resolution, which enshrines the nuclear deal. European powers have been scrambling to salvage the accord. In February, Russia vetoed a U.S.-led bid for the Security Council to call out Tehran for failing to prevent its weapons from falling into the hands of Yemen’s Houthi group, a charge Tehran denies. Haley arranged Tuesday’s event after several members expressed opposition to her plan to convene a meeting on Wednesday on Nicaragua. Haley said their views should be on record. More than 300 people have been killed and thousands injured in crackdowns by police and armed groups on protests over government plans to cut welfare benefits. The protests developed into broader opposition against President Daniel Ortega. China, Russia, Bolivia and others said the situation in Nicaragua was not a threat to international peace and security and therefore should not be discussed by the council. The United States has the nine votes required to defeat a procedural vote expected to be called by Bolivia, diplomats said.

2018-09-04,"(Reuters) - Oil and gas producer Southwestern Energy Co (SWN.N) agreed to sell its Fayetteville shale assets in Arkansas to privately owned Flywheel Energy LLC in an all-cash deal valued at about $1.87 billion, Southwestern said on Tuesday.  The deal culminates a six-month effort by the Houston-based company to find a buyer for the Fayetteville shale operations to pay off debt it ran up years ago when U.S. natural gas prices were higher.  “The debt was an overhang on our stock,” the company’s chief executive officer, Bill Way, said in an interview. “We’re focused on the highest-return projects in our portfolio, and at today’s prices, those are in the Appalachia basin.”  Southwestern plans to pay off $900 million of its more than $3 billion in debt with the proceeds, and will spend $200 million to repurchase shares over the next 12 months, Way said. Southwestern’s shares declined nearly 3 percent to $5.46 following the announcement.  Investors were disappointed that Southwestern earmarked only about half of the proceeds to repay debt, with $600 million to be used to expand production despite low natural gas prices, Scott Hanold, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said.  “There was some hope the transaction would result in lower leverage, but the reality is the leverage metrics don’t change too much,” Hanold said. “That could imply the company will outspend cash flow.”  Hanold said investors want to see Southwestern’s ratio of debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization - a financial yardstick often used to evaluate the health of an energy exploration and production company - decline to 2-to-1, down from the current 2.7-to-1.  Several potential buyers had expressed interest, said Way, who declined to name the suitors. Southwestern will turn its focus to expanding its natural gas and gas-liquids output in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In July, BHP Billiton (BHP.AX) sold its Fayetteville assets for about $300 million to Merit Energy Co as part of its exit from U.S. shale properties. Low gas prices have encouraged companies to seek more profitable liquids production.  Southwestern will have $2.3 billion in debt after the deal closes in December. “Our goal is to have a self-funding Appalachia business as we complete 2020,” Way said.  Backed by investment firm Kayne Anderson, Flywheel will assume $438 million of future contractual liabilities.

Any slowdown could hurt oilfield service companies that have only recently started to recover from the 2014 oil-price crash. “These challenges will likely have a dampening effect on production growth, wellhead prices and investment levels in the coming year,” CEO Paal Kibsgaard said at a Barclays conference in New York. The lack of transportation capacity would be resolved by the end of 2019, he said. Kibsgaard said market consensus that Permian production will continue to climb by 1.5 million barrels per day annually is “starting to be called into question.” The Permian produced about 3.4 million barrels of oil per day in August, or about 46 percent of all U.S. shale production, according to an estimate from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). The hydraulic fracturing market, which had been seen as a bright spot in the North American services sector, also has softened more than expected, Kibsgaard said, as more producers hold off completing wells until oil prices climb and more pressure-pumping fleets enter the market. Schlumberger shares were down about 1.2 percent to $61.86 around 12:00 ET.

Oil prices rose as Gulf of Mexico rigs were evacuated in preparation for a hurricane. Emerging markets stocks and currencies were under added pressure on concerns about inflation in Turkey, and after data showed South Africa had slumped into recession in the second quarter. U.S. Treasury yields rose as investors prepared for heavy corporate debt supply, and as falling Italian debt yields reduced safety demand for U.S. government debt. The public comment period on a U.S. proposal for new tariffs on Chinese goods is set to end on Thursday. U.S. President Donald Trump can then follow through on plans to impose levies on $200 billion more of Chinese imports. U.S.-Canada trade talks ended on Friday with no deal to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) after Trump told Congress he would sign a bilateral trade pact with Mexico. “My sense would be Trump is focused on Mexico, but he is not in any mood to compromise on Canada, Europe or China,” said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 88.02 points, or 0.34 percent, to 25,876.8, the S&P 500 lost 11.15 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,890.37 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 45.95 points, or 0.57 percent, to 8,063.59. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.75 percent. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.63 percent for its biggest one-day decline since August 15, weighed down by declines in Wall Street’s major indexes and a drop in European stocks after China closed higher. MSCI’s emerging market stocks index was down 0.7 percent and on track for its fifth straight day of declines. In currencies, the South African rand ZAR= was last down 2.7 percent against the dollar, while Turkey’s Lira was last down 1 percent. The Canadian dollar weakened to a six-week low against its U.S. counterpart amid an uncertain outlook for Canada’s trading arrangement with the United States. The Canadian dollar fell 0.72 percent versus the greenback at 1.32 per dollar. A JPMorgan emerging market currency index fell to its lowest since May 2017. The Turkish lira TRY=D3 and the Mexican peso MXN=D3 also slipped against the dollar. “We are just waiting for something to turn the EM (emerging market) sentiment because the valuations look really attractive, but it’s just a slow meltdown at the moment,” said Standard Life Aberdeen EM portfolio manager Viktor Szabo.

Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati didn’t say what sanctions speculators could face, but warned that large currency transactions would be checked by Bank Indonesia (BI) and the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to ensure they were based on trade or commerce, and not just playing the market. “If there are parties who are making profits based on other people’s sacrifices, then the OJK (FSA) and BI would monitor in detail and take firm action against these players who are profit taking,” she said. Fear of contagion from the economic woes in Argentina and Turkey have driven investors away from emerging markets, and the rupiah has become the second worst performing emerging Asian currency after the Indian rupee, having lost nearly 9 percent of its value this year. On Tuesday, the rupiah touched 14,940 to the dollar, its weakest in 20 years. Addressing a parliamentary hearing on the government’s budget proposals, Bank Indonesia Governor Perry Warjiyo said the rupiah should come under less pressure next year as the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to increase interest rates just three times next year, compared with four time this year. Earlier on Tuesday, Darmin Nasution, coordinating minister for economic affairs, said authorities were examining the reasons behind the rupiah’s drop, saying there had been speculative trading and a technical problem with quotations. “There were things that pushed the depreciation further, that we think makes it illogical. We’re looking to find out why beside Argentina’s problem,” Nasution said after a meeting with President Joko Widodo attended by other ministers and the central bank governor. Bank Indonesia and the FSA had received complaints from fund managers that some commercial banks were not quoting dollar-rupiah rates on Friday, leaving them unable to trade, Nasution said. “I don’t know what happened... but immediately it was resolved,” he said. “My point is there are technical problems that should not have occurred, but they happened.” Since mid-May, BI has raised interest rates by 125 basis points and spent billions of dollars in intervention defending the rupiah. In an attempt to anticipate future dollar requirements, Widodo asked ministers to assess how much foreign currency would be needed to pay for imports related to large infrastructure projects underway, Nasution said. To reduce the oil import bill, Indonesia has sought to boost of the use of biodiesel. On Wednesday, the government will announce import tariffs on hundreds of consumer goods, Indrawati said. Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Ignasius Jonan said later that the government would postpone or restructure several strategic power and oil and gas projects amid efforts to reduce imports and support the rupiah. Jonan said 15,200 megawatts of power projects worth an estimated $24-$25 billion, roughly half of President Widodo’s flagship 35 gigawatt powerstation development programme, would need to be rescheduled “to reduce the burden of imports deemed unnecessary”. Power projects generally contain 60 to 80 percent imported components, and for refineries the figure is 80-90 percent, Jonan said, adding that the government plans to block imports of any items that can be sourced locally. The minister declined to comment on which oil and gas projects would be delayed or restructured, but noted that refinery projects should continue as planned. The government would also push resource companies to use letters of credit and keep proceeds from exports in local banks, he said. If that money is kept overseas or outside state banks, Jonan warned, companies could be hit with sanctions that “reduce their export capacity” or production.

2018-09-04,"(Reuters) - Offshore oil driller Transocean Ltd said on Tuesday it would buy peer Ocean Rig UDW Inc in a $2.7 billion cash-and-stock deal, its second major acquisition this year as the company bets on a recovery in the offshore sector.     The acquisition signals new optimism for offshore drillers, which were hit hard by the steep plunge in oil prices from 2014. Offshore projects, which are more costly than onshore work and take years to develop, became less attractive after oil prices fell to below $30 a barrel in 2016. Global crude prices have since recovered to above $70, renewing producer interest in offshore basins around the world, including Brazil and the U.S. and Mexican Gulf of Mexico. The deal would provide Switzerland-based Transocean with nine ultra-deepwater drillships and two semisubmersibles, the company said. Annual cost savings are projected to be about $70 million. “The combination of constructive and stable oil prices over the last several quarters, streamlined offshore project costs, and undeniable reserve replacement challenges has driven a material increase in offshore contracting activity,” said Transocean Chief Executive Jeremy Thigpen. Ocean Rig shares were up 11.7 percent at $30.24, after climbing roughly 13 percent, while Transocean’s U.S.-listed shares fell 6.5 percent to $11.33 at mid-morning. Transocean earlier this year acquired Norwegian rig firm Songa Offshore in a $1.1 billion deal. “We see strong contract opportunities emerging across the globe for the combined fleet (particularly in Brazil),” analysts at Tudor Pickering & Holt Co wrote in a note on Tuesday.  Majors, including Norway’s Equinor, Chevron Corp and BP, won bids for offshore blocks in Brazil, which hold billions of barrels of oil. Elsewhere, Exxon Mobil Corp said last month it had begun offshore exploration drilling off Australia’s southeast coast, while also pursuing finds at its offshore Guyana discovery. “The announcement is not a surprise. Industry consolidation is necessary to get these premium assets back to work over the next two to three years,” Leslie Cook, an analyst with Wood Mackenzie, said in a note. She added that, “as rates begin to float back up, the need to keep drilling costs down will drive demand for these newer rigs.” Transocean will pay 1.6128 newly issued shares and $12.75 in cash for each share of Ocean Rig’s common stock for an implied value of $32.28 per Ocean Rig share, which represents a premium of 19.2 percent to the stock’s close on Friday. Upon completion, Transocean shareholders will own about 79 percent of the combined company, while Ocean Rig shareholders will hold the remaining 21 percent.

2018-09-04,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan issued evacuation advisories for more than a million people and canceled hundreds of flights as Typhoon Jebi sliced across the west on Tuesday, cutting power, overturning cars and killing at least six people. Jebi, or “swallow” in Korean, was briefly a super typhoon and is the most powerful storm to hit Japan in 25 years following rains, landslides, floods and record-breaking heat that killed hundreds of people this summer. GRAPHIC: Japan Typhoon IMG - tmsnrt.rs/2N6Eudz Television footage showed waves pounding the coastline, sheet metal tumbling across a parking lot, cars turned on their sides, dozens of used cars on fire at an exhibition area, and a big Ferris wheel spinning around in the strong wind. As the typhoon made landfall, a 71-year-old man was found dead under a collapsed warehouse, likely due to a strong wind, and a man in his 70s fell from the roof of a house and died, NHK public television reported, adding more than 90 were injured. NHK and broadcaster TBS put the number of deaths at six. Tides in some areas were the highest since a typhoon in 1961, NHK said, with flooding covering one runway at Kansai airport near Osaka, forcing the closure of the airport and leaving about 3,000 tourists stranded. “This storm is super (strong). I hope I can get home,” a woman from Hong Kong told NHK at the airport.         The strong winds and high tides sent a 2,591-tonne tanker crashing into a bridge connecting the airport, built on a man-made island in a bay, to the mainland. The bridge was damaged and closed, but the tanker was empty and none of its crew was injured, the coast guard said.     The storm made landfall on Shikoku, the smallest main island, around noon. It raked across the western part of the largest main island, Honshu, near the city of Kobe, several hours later, before heading into the Sea of Japan in the evening. The center of Jebi was about 100 km west-northwest of Sado in Niigata prefecture, central Japan, and heading north-northeast, NHK said. Evacuation advisories were issued for more than a million people at one point, the Fire and Disaster Management Agency said. Wind gusts of up to 208 km/h (129 mph) were recorded in one part of Shikoku. Around 100 mm (3.9 inches) of rain drenched one part of the tourist city of Kyoto in an hour, with as much as 500 mm (20 inches) set to fall in some areas in the 24 hours to noon on Wednesday. Video posted on Twitter showed a small part of the roof of Kyoto train station falling to the ground. Other video showed roofs being torn off houses, transformers on electric poles exploding and a car scudding on its side across a parking lot. Nearly 800 flights were canceled, along with scores of ferries and trains, NHK said. Shinkansen bullet train services between Tokyo and Okayama were suspended and Universal Studios Japan, a popular amusement park near Osaka, was closed. Some 1.6 million households were without power in Osaka and its surrounding areas at 5 p.m. (0800 GMT) Toyota Motor Corp said it was cancelling the night shift at 14 plants. The capital, Tokyo, escaped the center of the storm but was set for heavy rains and high winds. Jebi’s course brought it close to parts of western Japan hit by rains and flooding that killed more than 200 people in July but most of the damage this time appeared to be from the wind.

2018-09-04,"* Dollar rise sends euro, yen and emerging market currencies lower * South Africa’s rand slumps towards two-year low * Chinese stocks snap five-day losing streak but Europe slips back * Italian bond markets cling to budget optimism * Metals hit by strong dollar but oil climbs By Marc Jones LONDON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - A rebound in Chinese shares and a rally in Italian bonds failed to keep Europe’s spirits up on Tuesday, as a renewed burst of dollar strength and news South Africa had slumped into recession ramped up the pressure on emerging markets again. The sight of European shares at a two-month low, a 2.3 percent thumping for South Africa’s rand and fragile Facebook shares meant Wall Street was facing a choppy restart after a long holiday weekend. India’s rupee and Indonesia’s rupiah had both slumped to new lows overnight in Asia too and the Turkish lira, Mexican peso and Russian rouble were all deep in the red again to complete a turbulent EM picture. Major FX pairs such as the euro and yen were knocked back too. The euro fell 0.5 percent to a 10-day low at $1.1558 while the yen dropped to 111.30 per dollar having strengthened during Asian trading. “The general sentiment is that the dollar has not done too badly out of the trade war concerns, with concerns the U.S. might signal a fresh escalation in the trade conflict,” said Kenneth Broux, an FX strategist at Societe Generale in London. The public comment period on a U.S. proposal for new tariffs on Chinese goods is set to end on Thursday, after which U.S. President Donald Trump can follow through on plans to impose levies on $200 billion more of Chinese imports, though it is unclear how quickly that will happen. What is sure though is that the concerns are starting to take their toll. Manufacturing surveys published on Monday showed mounting stress on factories across Europe and Asia as the outlook for global trade dims. Emerging market currencies are coming in for special punishment. The latest drop in Turkey’s lira took it back past 6.6 per dollar and all eyes were on how Argentina’s peso would fare during the Latin American session  after it ended more than 3 percent weaker on Monday. That came despite President Mauricio Macri announcing new taxes on exports and steep cuts to government spending in what he termed “emergency” measures to balance next year’s budget as part of a $50 billion IMF support package. “We are just waiting for something to turn the EM (emerging market) sentiment because the valuations look really attractive, but it’s just a slow meltdown at the moment,” said Standard Life Aberdeen EM portfolio manager Viktor Szabo. He pointed out that South Africa’s rand had now wiped out all the gains it made after Cyril Ramaphosa replaced Jacob Zuma as the country’s president in February. European shares were down almost 1 percent ahead of the U.S opening, reversing a positive start. Financials held up a bit better, supported by strength among some Italian banks following soothing comments from Italian ministers on forthcoming budget proposals. Well-placed sources told Reuters that Rome’s Economy Minister Giovanni Tria was pushing the governing coalition to keep next year’s budget deficit below 2 percent of output. Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini had said on Monday that it would not breach the European Union’s 3 percent limit. Italian government bonds also rallied with yields on two-year bonds, flirting with their biggest daily drop in almost three months at 1.265 percent. Yields move inversely to a bond’s price. The closely-watched Italy/Germany 10-year bond yield spread also narrowed. “I would say the overall price action is quite encouraging and Salvini’s comments yesterday gave the market another push,” Commerzbank rates strategist Christoph Rieger said. Elsewhere it was a very different story. Emerging market debt presented an ugly picture amid the widespread gloom, while expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise U.S. interest rates again this month pushed up the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes to 2.8640 percent. More sensitive two-year U.S. yields touched 2.637 percent, compared with Friday’s close of 2.629 percent. The moves were also helped by rising oil prices. U.S. crude rose past the $71 per barrel mark, with production coming under pressure as two Gulf of Mexico oil platforms were evacuated in preparation for a hurricane. U.S. crude was 0.5 percent higher at $70.15 per barrel. Brent crude was up at $79.03 per barrel after earlier trading lower on news that India had permitted its state refiners to import Iranian oil if Iran arranged tankers and insurance. Gold was slightly lower as the dollar strengthened, with spot gold traded at $1,195 per ounce, while silver, palladium and industrial metals such as copper and nickel saw more than 1 percent falls.

2018-09-04,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China LNG imports vs. Spot price: tmsnrt.rs/2oDtqqg By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Sept 4 (Reuters) - China appears set to once again boost its purchases of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for the northern winter, but unlike last year’s rush, this time the process is likely to be more organised and stable. In recent weeks there have been several indicators that China is planning on increasing the use of natural gas in winter heating, replacing boilers that use more polluting coal. Curbing winter air pollution has been a major aim of the authorities in Beijing, but they were stung by criticism last year that the switch to natural gas was made too quickly and the resulting shortages left some people without adequate heating. A sign that Beijing is putting more effort into ensuring sufficient natural gas supplies came last week when Vice-Minister of Finance Liu Wei was quoted by the Communist Party newspaper as saying that gas supply agreements must be in place when converting coal-fired boilers to the cleaner fuel. These comments were followed by an announcement by state-owned oil and gas major Sinopec that it is putting in place a range of measures to boost winter natural gas supplies, including increasing purchases of spot LNG cargoes and boosting distribution. It’s often a challenge with China to work out exactly how official pronouncements will translate into real world action, but in all likelihood China is going to increase LNG imports in coming months. This will come on top of an already strong year so far, with both official customs data and vessel-tracking data compiled by Thomson Reuters showing impressive gains. China imported about 4.55 million tonnes of LNG in August, the highest since January, according to the shipping data. Imports for the first eight months totalled 32.2 million tonnes, up 46.4 percent from the same period last year. Customs data for the January to July period shows imports of about 28.05 million tonnes, up 47.6 percent from the same period in 2017. In addition to the surge in import volumes, the data show that China’s LNG purchases haven’t shown as much of the seasonal swings of past years, with a strong winter peak followed by lulls in spring and summer, before picking up in autumn. In the 2017-18 winter, imports in December and January were some 72 percent higher than those in July 2017. However, imports in July this year, were only 17.4 percent below the previous winter peak months of December and January, indicating that LNG demand has remained robust throughout the year so far. There was a hotter-than-usual summer in China, which boosted electricity demand for air-conditioning, but this had more of an impact on coal demand, given limited power generation from natural gas. It seems that China has not only been increasing its year-round consumption of natural gas, but has also been building up storage capacity in order to increase availability during the winter peak. What appears to be happening is that China’s LNG demand is becoming more year-round, which should mitigate swings in spot pricing in Asia. Indeed, this has already occurred to some extent, with spot prices LNG-AS showing a milder decline to the 2018 low point from the prior winter’s peak than in previous years. The drop from the winter peak in January to the low in March was 39 percent, compared to 44.6 percent last year and 48.7 percent the year before. It’s also worth noting that spot LNG enjoyed a surprise summer peak, but this is more likely related to the unusually hot northern summer. Prices have been rising since late July and last week reached $11.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). This is coincidentally the peak price from the previous winter, which was reached in mid-January. This is a sign that spot LNG prices are likely to rise further in coming weeks, but may peak earlier than usual, assuming winter temperatures fall within the normal ranges.

2018-09-04,"BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Five protesters were killed and 16 more were injured during a second day of clashes with security forces in Iraq’s main southern city Basra, local health and security sources said. Twenty-two members of the security forces were also wounded, some by a hand grenade, the sources said, in some of the worst unrest reported during months of protests sweeping the long neglected south, heartland of Iraq’s Shi’ite Muslim majority. Protesters are angry over electricity outages during the hot Iraqi summer, a lack of jobs and proper government services and entrenched corruption. Basra residents say salt seeping into the water supply has made it undrinkable and sent hundreds to hospital, proof, they say, that infrastructure has been allowed to collapse in the part of the country that produces most of its oil wealth. As the clashes continued to unfold, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi convened an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the unrest and ordered the Interior Ministry to conduct an immediate investigation into the protests, state media reported. Hundreds of people gathered at local government buildings, hurled petrol bombs and stones and attempted to block roads leading to the building for a second night. Some protesters stormed one of the provincial government buildings and set it alight.  Security forces fired live rounds in the air as well as teargas to try to disperse the crowd, local sources said. Smoke could be seen billowing from the outer perimeter of the provincial government headquarters, where many had gathered earlier on Tuesday to mourn a protester who died on Monday night, Yasser Makki. The crowds near the government buildings had largely dispersed by 11 p.m., after a citywide curfew was imposed by the city’s security officials.  Iraq’s second biggest city, Basra is a stronghold of Moqtada al-Sadr, a Shi’ite cleric and former leader of anti-American sectarian militia who has recast himself as an anti-corruption campaigner.  In a tweet, Sadr appeared to back the protesters, condemning the tactics used by some members of the security forces against who he said were “unarmed demonstrators who only want to live with dignity”.   The public anger has swelled at a time when politicians are struggling to form a new government after an inconclusive parliamentary election in May. Iraq’s top Shi’ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani has expressed support for the protests. Earlier on Tuesday, mourners carried Makki’s body near the building, chanting “Yasser’s blood will not be lost”. They damaged the gate of the local government building but were dispersed by security forces using teargas before they could enter it. Earlier on Tuesday, Abadi had ordered an investigation into Makki’s death during his weekly press conference. “Our orders are clear in banning the firing of live ammunition during demonstrations,” Abadi said. He suspended the electricity minister last month, saying his government had begun punishing those responsible for poor services in Basra.

2018-09-04,"(Adds Talos Energy, broker quote on impact) HOUSTON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Three more oil producers pulled employees out of Tropical Storm Gordon’s path, and companies cut 9 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil and gas production on Tuesday as the storm churned toward an expected nighttime landfall. The storm, which is expected to strengthen into a Category 1 hurricane with winds of at least 74 miles per hour (119 kph), shifted eastward, reducing its threat to producers on the western side of the Gulf and most Gulf Coast refineries. Companies evacuated 54 offshore platforms and halted 156,907 barrels per day of oil production and 232 million cubic feet per day of natural gas output, according to estimates by the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. Offshore oil production accounts for 17 percent of total U.S. oil production and 5 percent of natural gas production. Talos Energy Inc, Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp on Tuesday evacuated employees and shut in several platforms in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Talos halted output at its Ram Powell, Amberjack and Pompano platforms, Exxon its Lena platform and Chevron Corp curtailed its Petronius platform. That followed Anadarko Petroleum Corp’s decision on Monday to evacuate staff and shut production at two oil platforms in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Other major oil producers, including ConocoPhillips, BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, said they continued to operate and were monitoring conditions. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, the largest privately owned crude terminal in the United States, also said it was operating normally. U.S. and global crude futures were up a fraction as traders said they did not expect the storm to have long-term impact on Gulf output. The storm’s potential threat also was overshadowed by a strong dollar and storage data that showed rising production, traders said. “We have a lot of shut-ins. A couple rigs, a couple ports are closed to incoming vessels,” one broker said. “But right now it is a Category 1 (hurricane). I can’t see why that scares anyone.” The ports of Gulfport and Pascagoula, Mississippi, and Mobile, Alabama, were closed to all traffic on Tuesday, the U.S. Coast said in a statement. New Orleans-area ports were operating under an advisory that called for gale-force winds within 24 hours. Reporting by Jessica Resnick-Ault, Scott Disavino, Devika

2018-09-04,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - The drought-causing El Nino weather phenomenon will return to Colombia in November, the country’s environment minister said on Tuesday, warning that agriculture, energy production and water provision could be affected by the predicted lack of rain. El Nino, a warming of ocean surface temperatures associated with crop damage, fires and flash floods, has damaged coffee and banana crops in Colombia in recent years and also contributed to a spike in food prices that stoked inflation figures. The Andean country, which generates 75 percent of its electricity via hydroelectric dams, was nearly forced to ration energy during the most recent El Nino, which lasted from the second half of 2015 through April 2016. The phenomenon is expected to extend into the first quarter of 2019, Environment Minister Ricardo Lozano told journalists, and grow worse then. “There will be a precipitation reduction, there will be drought,” Lozano said. “That will directly affect those that supply water: aqueducts, the energy sector, in the health sector, irrigation areas.” Colombia’s electricity generation is guaranteed despite the phenomenon, Angela Montoya, the head of the country’s electric energy generators association said.  Reservoirs that supply hydroelectric dams will be at 70 percent capacity in November, Montoya said, and will work in tandem with thermal coal power stations. Colombia currently has the capacity to generate some 17,500 megawatts, though it consumes only 13,000 MW.

2018-09-04,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed on Tuesday, as energy infrastructure on the U.S. Gulf Coast braced for a hurricane, but gains were capped as a stronger dollar and report of rising stockpiles at the Cushing, Oklahoma hub weighed.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose 7 cents to settle at $69.87 a barrel after earlier hitting a session high of $71.40. U.S. markets were closed on Monday for Labor Day.  Brent crude LCOc1, which traded on Monday, was ended 2 cents firmer to settle at $78.17 a barrel, down from a session high of $79.72. Both benchmarks jumped earlier in the session as more oil producers pulled employees out of Tropical Storm Gordon’s path and shut-in 9 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil and gas production on Tuesday. But the storm, expected to make a nighttime landfall as a category 1 hurricane, shifted eastward, reducing its threat to major production areas and most Gulf Coast refineries.  Vessel traffic along the U.S. Gulf Coast was also under restrictions ahead of Gordon.  The Gulf of Mexico is home to 17 percent of U.S. crude oil production and 5 percent of natural gas output daily, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. On land, the Gulf Coast serves as a major U.S. refining hub.  Prices moved lower, however, as market participants saw the market as overbought. “Initial reaction this morning appeared exaggerated as disruption to Gulf of Mexico production infrastructure isn’t likely to extract a major amount of crude from the market,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. “The larger impact of the storm is apt to fall on Gulf coast refinery activity that could be affected by power outages.” Weighing on oil prices, Cushing, Oklahoma, crude inventories rose nearly 754,000 barrels from Aug. 24 to Friday, traders said, citing a report from market intelligence firm Genscape. A rising U.S. dollar index .DXY also pushed crude futures lower. A stronger dollar makes greenback-denominated oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.

Investors anticipate less supply from Iran as U.S. sanctions on Tehran begin to bite. Harry Tchilinguirian, oil strategist at BNP Paribas, warned of “supply issues” into 2019. “Crude oil export losses from Iran due to U.S. sanctions, production decline in Venezuela and episodic outages in Libya are unlikely to be offset entirely by corresponding rises in OPEC+ production,” Tchilinguirian said.

2018-09-04,"UREÑA, Venezuela (Reuters) - Frustrated Venezuelan drivers faced lengthy lines for gasoline in border states on Tuesday as the government struggled to roll out a new payment system that President Nicolas Maduro says will reduce smuggling of heavily-subsidized fuel.  Maduro says the payment system will pave the way for charging international prices for fuel - a massive increase given that gas is now almost free - as his government seeks to shore up state coffers amid a hyperinflationary economic meltdown. Any increase would mark the first time in 20 years that the OPEC member has significantly raised domestic fuel prices, which have been a sensitive issue ever since deadly riots broke out in 1989 in response to austerity measures that included higher gasoline prices.  The pilot program that began on Tuesday in eight states was supposed to provide service stations with wireless devices that use a state-backed identification document called the Fatherland Card to carry out fuel transactions. “I see a lot of disorganization because they haven’t started making this work yet,” said Jose Coronel, 26, a civil servant, as he waited in line at a gas station in the border town of Ureña. “I can see that it’s difficult to control smuggling.”  At gas stations along the border with neighboring Colombia, the new machines were either not installed or not functioning properly, according to drivers filling up their tanks and two gas station attendants in two different states. The new payment system will provide a subsidy to motorists with a Fatherland Card, directly reimbursing them for gasoline purchases, once the domestic fuel price hikes take effect.  Maduro says that will help soften the impact of a steep price increase. Drivers on the border started lining up as early as Monday afternoon on concerns that the price hikes would be immediate or that stations would run out of fuel. The Information Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Experts estimate Venezuela - where shortages of food and medicine have fueled hunger, disease and a mass exodus of citizens - loses at least $5 billion per year as a result of not selling gasoline at international prices. Maduro on Monday said gasoline would rise to international price levels by October, without offering details. The use of the Fatherland Card has drawn intense criticism from government critics, who say it is a mechanism to gather information about citizens that the ruling Socialist Party can use against adversaries by withholding basic services from them.  The government offers some benefits including subsidized food, access to scarce medicine and cash bonuses to holders of the card. Maduro says it will help combat an “economic war” led by opposition politicians with the help of Washington.  Fuel prices have stayed relatively steady for years even though inflation is projected by the IMF to reach 1,000,000 percent.  Unay Bayona, 24, an independent merchant, said he doubted prices would ever rise enough to match those in Colombia, and that residents would continue to view contraband as an option.  “Smuggling is going to continue because there is no other way to make a living,” Bayona said, at the entrance to a service station in Ureña.

2018-09-04,"(Corrects to say U.S. has pushed the U.N. to call out Iran, not add sanctions on Iran, paragraph 2) By Michelle Nichols UNITED NATIONS, Sept 4 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will chair a United Nations Security Council meeting on Iran this month during the annual gathering of world leaders in New York, diplomats and U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said on Tuesday. The United States, which holds the council presidency for September, has unsuccessfully pushed the U.N. to call out Iran. Haley has regularly attacked Iran, accusing it of meddling in the wars in Syria and Yemen. Diplomats said Iran could request to speak at the Sept. 26 council meeting, the week of the U.N. General Assembly. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is expected to address the assembly on Sept. 25. The Iranian U.N. mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. During a rare public meeting on Tuesday to discuss the proposed U.S. agenda for the council, Russia’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said the Iran meeting should focus on the implementation of a 2015 resolution on Iran. “We very much hope that there will be views voiced in connection with the U.S. withdrawal” from a 2015 international nuclear deal, Polyanskiy told the council. Trump in May withdrew from the accord between Iran and six world powers aimed at stalling Tehran’s nuclear capabilities in return for lifting some sanctions. Trump ordered the reimposition of U.S. sanctions suspended under the deal. Iran is still subject to a U.N. arms embargo and other restrictions contained in the 2015 resolution, which enshrines the nuclear deal. European powers have been scrambling to salvage the accord. In February, Russia vetoed a U.S.-led bid for the Security Council to call out Tehran for failing to prevent its weapons from falling into the hands of Yemen’s Houthi group, a charge Tehran denies. Haley arranged Tuesday’s event after several members expressed opposition to her plan to convene a meeting on Wednesday on Nicaragua. Haley said their views should be on record. More than 300 people have been killed and thousands injured in crackdowns by police and armed groups on protests over government plans to cut welfare benefits. The protests developed into broader opposition against President Daniel Ortega. China, Russia, Bolivia and others said the situation in Nicaragua was not a threat to international peace and security and therefore should not be discussed by the council. The United States has the nine votes required to defeat a procedural vote expected to be called by Bolivia, diplomats said.

2018-09-04,"(Reuters) - Oil and gas producer Southwestern Energy Co (SWN.N) agreed to sell its Fayetteville shale assets in Arkansas to privately owned Flywheel Energy LLC in an all-cash deal valued at about $1.87 billion, Southwestern said on Tuesday.  The deal culminates a six-month effort by the Houston-based company to find a buyer for the Fayetteville shale operations to pay off debt it ran up years ago when U.S. natural gas prices were higher.  “The debt was an overhang on our stock,” the company’s chief executive officer, Bill Way, said in an interview. “We’re focused on the highest-return projects in our portfolio, and at today’s prices, those are in the Appalachia basin.”  Southwestern plans to pay off $900 million of its more than $3 billion in debt with the proceeds, and will spend $200 million to repurchase shares over the next 12 months, Way said. Southwestern’s shares declined nearly 3 percent to $5.46 following the announcement.  Investors were disappointed that Southwestern earmarked only about half of the proceeds to repay debt, with $600 million to be used to expand production despite low natural gas prices, Scott Hanold, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said.  “There was some hope the transaction would result in lower leverage, but the reality is the leverage metrics don’t change too much,” Hanold said. “That could imply the company will outspend cash flow.”  Hanold said investors want to see Southwestern’s ratio of debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization - a financial yardstick often used to evaluate the health of an energy exploration and production company - decline to 2-to-1, down from the current 2.7-to-1.  Several potential buyers had expressed interest, said Way, who declined to name the suitors. Southwestern will turn its focus to expanding its natural gas and gas-liquids output in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In July, BHP Billiton (BHP.AX) sold its Fayetteville assets for about $300 million to Merit Energy Co as part of its exit from U.S. shale properties. Low gas prices have encouraged companies to seek more profitable liquids production.  Southwestern will have $2.3 billion in debt after the deal closes in December. “Our goal is to have a self-funding Appalachia business as we complete 2020,” Way said.  Backed by investment firm Kayne Anderson, Flywheel will assume $438 million of future contractual liabilities.

A surge in oil and gas production in the Permian basin of west Texas and New Mexico has outstripped transport capacity, pushing the local price of oil to four-year lows and threatening to curtail drilling activity. Any slowdown could hurt oilfield service companies that have only recently started to recover from the 2014 oil-price crash. “These challenges will likely have a dampening effect on production growth, wellhead prices and investment levels in the coming year,” CEO Paal Kibsgaard said at a Barclays conference in New York. The lack of transportation capacity would be resolved by the end of 2019, he said. Kibsgaard said market consensus that Permian production will continue to climb by 1.5 million barrels per day annually is “starting to be called into question.” The Permian produced about 3.4 million barrels of oil per day in August, or about 46 percent of all U.S. shale production, according to an estimate from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). The hydraulic fracturing market, which had been seen as a bright spot in the North American services sector, also has softened more than expected, Kibsgaard said, as more producers hold off completing wells until oil prices climb and more pressure-pumping fleets enter the market.

Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati didn’t say what sanctions speculators could face, but warned that large currency transactions would be checked by Bank Indonesia (BI) and the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to ensure they were based on trade or commerce, and not just playing the market. “If there are parties who are making profits based on other people’s sacrifices, then the OJK (FSA) and BI would monitor in detail and take firm action against these players who are profit taking,” she said. Fear of contagion from the economic woes in Argentina and Turkey have driven investors away from emerging markets, and the rupiah has become the second worst performing emerging Asian currency after the Indian rupee, having lost nearly 9 percent of its value this year. On Tuesday, the rupiah touched 14,940 to the dollar, its weakest in 20 years. Addressing a parliamentary hearing on the government’s budget proposals, Bank Indonesia Governor Perry Warjiyo said the rupiah should come under less pressure next year as the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to increase interest rates just three times next year, compared with four time this year. Earlier on Tuesday, Darmin Nasution, coordinating minister for economic affairs, said authorities were examining the reasons behind the rupiah’s drop, saying there had been speculative trading and a technical problem with quotations. “There were things that pushed the depreciation further, that we think makes it illogical. We’re looking to find out why beside Argentina’s problem,” Nasution said after a meeting with President Joko Widodo attended by other ministers and the central bank governor. Bank Indonesia and the FSA had received complaints from fund managers that some commercial banks were not quoting dollar-rupiah rates on Friday, leaving them unable to trade, Nasution said. “I don’t know what happened... but immediately it was resolved,” he said. “My point is there are technical problems that should not have occurred, but they happened.” Since mid-May, BI has raised interest rates by 125 basis points and spent billions of dollars in intervention defending the rupiah. In an attempt to anticipate future dollar requirements, Widodo asked ministers to assess how much foreign currency would be needed to pay for imports related to large infrastructure projects underway, Nasution said. To reduce the oil import bill, Indonesia has sought to boost of the use of biodiesel. On Wednesday, the government will announce import tariffs on hundreds of consumer goods, Indrawati said. Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Ignasius Jonan said later that the government would postpone or restructure several strategic power and oil and gas projects amid efforts to reduce imports and support the rupiah. Jonan said 15,200 megawatts of power projects worth an estimated $24-$25 billion, roughly half of President Widodo’s flagship 35 gigawatt powerstation development programme, would need to be rescheduled “to reduce the burden of imports deemed unnecessary”. Power projects generally contain 60 to 80 percent imported components, and for refineries the figure is 80-90 percent, Jonan said, adding that the government plans to block imports of any items that can be sourced locally. The minister declined to comment on which oil and gas projects would be delayed or restructured, but noted that refinery projects should continue as planned. The government would also push resource companies to use letters of credit and keep proceeds from exports in local banks, he said. If that money is kept overseas or outside state banks, Jonan warned, companies could be hit with sanctions that “reduce their export capacity” or production.

2018-09-04,"(Reuters) - Offshore oil driller Transocean Ltd said on Tuesday it would buy peer Ocean Rig UDW Inc in a $2.7 billion cash-and-stock deal, its second major acquisition this year as the company bets on a recovery in the offshore sector.     The acquisition signals new optimism for offshore drillers, which were hit hard by the steep plunge in oil prices from 2014. Offshore projects, which are more costly than onshore work and take years to develop, became less attractive after oil prices fell to below $30 a barrel in 2016. Global crude prices have since recovered to above $70, renewing producer interest in offshore basins around the world, including Brazil and the U.S. and Mexican Gulf of Mexico. The deal would provide Switzerland-based Transocean with nine ultra-deepwater drillships and two semisubmersibles, the company said. Annual cost savings are projected to be about $70 million. “The combination of constructive and stable oil prices over the last several quarters, streamlined offshore project costs, and undeniable reserve replacement challenges has driven a material increase in offshore contracting activity,” said Transocean Chief Executive Jeremy Thigpen. Ocean Rig shares were up 11.7 percent at $30.24, after climbing roughly 13 percent, while Transocean’s U.S.-listed shares fell 6.5 percent to $11.33 at mid-morning. Transocean earlier this year acquired Norwegian rig firm Songa Offshore in a $1.1 billion deal. “We see strong contract opportunities emerging across the globe for the combined fleet (particularly in Brazil),” analysts at Tudor Pickering & Holt Co wrote in a note on Tuesday.  Majors, including Norway’s Equinor, Chevron Corp and BP, won bids for offshore blocks in Brazil, which hold billions of barrels of oil. Elsewhere, Exxon Mobil Corp said last month it had begun offshore exploration drilling off Australia’s southeast coast, while also pursuing finds at its offshore Guyana discovery. “The announcement is not a surprise. Industry consolidation is necessary to get these premium assets back to work over the next two to three years,” Leslie Cook, an analyst with Wood Mackenzie, said in a note. She added that, “as rates begin to float back up, the need to keep drilling costs down will drive demand for these newer rigs.” Transocean will pay 1.6128 newly issued shares and $12.75 in cash for each share of Ocean Rig’s common stock for an implied value of $32.28 per Ocean Rig share, which represents a premium of 19.2 percent to the stock’s close on Friday. Upon completion, Transocean shareholders will own about 79 percent of the combined company, while Ocean Rig shareholders will hold the remaining 21 percent.

2018-09-04,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan issued evacuation advisories for more than a million people and canceled hundreds of flights as Typhoon Jebi sliced across the west on Tuesday, cutting power, overturning cars and killing at least six people. Jebi, or “swallow” in Korean, was briefly a super typhoon and is the most powerful storm to hit Japan in 25 years following rains, landslides, floods and record-breaking heat that killed hundreds of people this summer. GRAPHIC: Japan Typhoon IMG - tmsnrt.rs/2N6Eudz Television footage showed waves pounding the coastline, sheet metal tumbling across a parking lot, cars turned on their sides, dozens of used cars on fire at an exhibition area, and a big Ferris wheel spinning around in the strong wind. As the typhoon made landfall, a 71-year-old man was found dead under a collapsed warehouse, likely due to a strong wind, and a man in his 70s fell from the roof of a house and died, NHK public television reported, adding more than 90 were injured. NHK and broadcaster TBS put the number of deaths at six. Tides in some areas were the highest since a typhoon in 1961, NHK said, with flooding covering one runway at Kansai airport near Osaka, forcing the closure of the airport and leaving about 3,000 tourists stranded. “This storm is super (strong). I hope I can get home,” a woman from Hong Kong told NHK at the airport.         The strong winds and high tides sent a 2,591-tonne tanker crashing into a bridge connecting the airport, built on a man-made island in a bay, to the mainland. The bridge was damaged and closed, but the tanker was empty and none of its crew was injured, the coast guard said.     The storm made landfall on Shikoku, the smallest main island, around noon. It raked across the western part of the largest main island, Honshu, near the city of Kobe, several hours later, before heading into the Sea of Japan in the evening. The center of Jebi was about 100 km west-northwest of Sado in Niigata prefecture, central Japan, and heading north-northeast, NHK said. Evacuation advisories were issued for more than a million people at one point, the Fire and Disaster Management Agency said. Wind gusts of up to 208 km/h (129 mph) were recorded in one part of Shikoku. Around 100 mm (3.9 inches) of rain drenched one part of the tourist city of Kyoto in an hour, with as much as 500 mm (20 inches) set to fall in some areas in the 24 hours to noon on Wednesday. Video posted on Twitter showed a small part of the roof of Kyoto train station falling to the ground. Other video showed roofs being torn off houses, transformers on electric poles exploding and a car scudding on its side across a parking lot. Nearly 800 flights were canceled, along with scores of ferries and trains, NHK said. Shinkansen bullet train services between Tokyo and Okayama were suspended and Universal Studios Japan, a popular amusement park near Osaka, was closed. Some 1.6 million households were without power in Osaka and its surrounding areas at 5 p.m. (0800 GMT) Toyota Motor Corp said it was cancelling the night shift at 14 plants. The capital, Tokyo, escaped the center of the storm but was set for heavy rains and high winds. Jebi’s course brought it close to parts of western Japan hit by rains and flooding that killed more than 200 people in July but most of the damage this time appeared to be from the wind.

2018-09-04,"* Dollar rise sends euro, yen and emerging market currencies lower * South Africa’s rand slumps towards two-year low * Chinese stocks snap five-day losing streak but Europe slips back * Italian bond markets cling to budget optimism * Metals hit by strong dollar but oil climbs By Marc Jones LONDON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - A rebound in Chinese shares and a rally in Italian bonds failed to keep Europe’s spirits up on Tuesday, as a renewed burst of dollar strength and news South Africa had slumped into recession ramped up the pressure on emerging markets again. The sight of European shares at a two-month low, a 2.3 percent thumping for South Africa’s rand and fragile Facebook shares meant Wall Street was facing a choppy restart after a long holiday weekend. India’s rupee and Indonesia’s rupiah had both slumped to new lows overnight in Asia too and the Turkish lira, Mexican peso and Russian rouble were all deep in the red again to complete a turbulent EM picture. Major FX pairs such as the euro and yen were knocked back too. The euro fell 0.5 percent to a 10-day low at $1.1558 while the yen dropped to 111.30 per dollar having strengthened during Asian trading. “The general sentiment is that the dollar has not done too badly out of the trade war concerns, with concerns the U.S. might signal a fresh escalation in the trade conflict,” said Kenneth Broux, an FX strategist at Societe Generale in London. The public comment period on a U.S. proposal for new tariffs on Chinese goods is set to end on Thursday, after which U.S. President Donald Trump can follow through on plans to impose levies on $200 billion more of Chinese imports, though it is unclear how quickly that will happen. What is sure though is that the concerns are starting to take their toll. Manufacturing surveys published on Monday showed mounting stress on factories across Europe and Asia as the outlook for global trade dims. Emerging market currencies are coming in for special punishment. The latest drop in Turkey’s lira took it back past 6.6 per dollar and all eyes were on how Argentina’s peso would fare during the Latin American session  after it ended more than 3 percent weaker on Monday. That came despite President Mauricio Macri announcing new taxes on exports and steep cuts to government spending in what he termed “emergency” measures to balance next year’s budget as part of a $50 billion IMF support package. “We are just waiting for something to turn the EM (emerging market) sentiment because the valuations look really attractive, but it’s just a slow meltdown at the moment,” said Standard Life Aberdeen EM portfolio manager Viktor Szabo. He pointed out that South Africa’s rand had now wiped out all the gains it made after Cyril Ramaphosa replaced Jacob Zuma as the country’s president in February. European shares were down almost 1 percent ahead of the U.S opening, reversing a positive start. Financials held up a bit better, supported by strength among some Italian banks following soothing comments from Italian ministers on forthcoming budget proposals. Well-placed sources told Reuters that Rome’s Economy Minister Giovanni Tria was pushing the governing coalition to keep next year’s budget deficit below 2 percent of output. Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini had said on Monday that it would not breach the European Union’s 3 percent limit. Italian government bonds also rallied with yields on two-year bonds, flirting with their biggest daily drop in almost three months at 1.265 percent. Yields move inversely to a bond’s price. The closely-watched Italy/Germany 10-year bond yield spread also narrowed. “I would say the overall price action is quite encouraging and Salvini’s comments yesterday gave the market another push,” Commerzbank rates strategist Christoph Rieger said. Elsewhere it was a very different story. Emerging market debt presented an ugly picture amid the widespread gloom, while expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise U.S. interest rates again this month pushed up the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes to 2.8640 percent. More sensitive two-year U.S. yields touched 2.637 percent, compared with Friday’s close of 2.629 percent. The moves were also helped by rising oil prices. U.S. crude rose past the $71 per barrel mark, with production coming under pressure as two Gulf of Mexico oil platforms were evacuated in preparation for a hurricane. U.S. crude was 0.5 percent higher at $70.15 per barrel. Brent crude was up at $79.03 per barrel after earlier trading lower on news that India had permitted its state refiners to import Iranian oil if Iran arranged tankers and insurance. Gold was slightly lower as the dollar strengthened, with spot gold traded at $1,195 per ounce, while silver, palladium and industrial metals such as copper and nickel saw more than 1 percent falls.

2018-09-04,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China LNG imports vs. Spot price: tmsnrt.rs/2oDtqqg By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Sept 4 (Reuters) - China appears set to once again boost its purchases of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for the northern winter, but unlike last year’s rush, this time the process is likely to be more organised and stable. In recent weeks there have been several indicators that China is planning on increasing the use of natural gas in winter heating, replacing boilers that use more polluting coal. Curbing winter air pollution has been a major aim of the authorities in Beijing, but they were stung by criticism last year that the switch to natural gas was made too quickly and the resulting shortages left some people without adequate heating. A sign that Beijing is putting more effort into ensuring sufficient natural gas supplies came last week when Vice-Minister of Finance Liu Wei was quoted by the Communist Party newspaper as saying that gas supply agreements must be in place when converting coal-fired boilers to the cleaner fuel. These comments were followed by an announcement by state-owned oil and gas major Sinopec that it is putting in place a range of measures to boost winter natural gas supplies, including increasing purchases of spot LNG cargoes and boosting distribution. It’s often a challenge with China to work out exactly how official pronouncements will translate into real world action, but in all likelihood China is going to increase LNG imports in coming months. This will come on top of an already strong year so far, with both official customs data and vessel-tracking data compiled by Thomson Reuters showing impressive gains. China imported about 4.55 million tonnes of LNG in August, the highest since January, according to the shipping data. Imports for the first eight months totalled 32.2 million tonnes, up 46.4 percent from the same period last year. Customs data for the January to July period shows imports of about 28.05 million tonnes, up 47.6 percent from the same period in 2017. In addition to the surge in import volumes, the data show that China’s LNG purchases haven’t shown as much of the seasonal swings of past years, with a strong winter peak followed by lulls in spring and summer, before picking up in autumn. In the 2017-18 winter, imports in December and January were some 72 percent higher than those in July 2017. However, imports in July this year, were only 17.4 percent below the previous winter peak months of December and January, indicating that LNG demand has remained robust throughout the year so far. There was a hotter-than-usual summer in China, which boosted electricity demand for air-conditioning, but this had more of an impact on coal demand, given limited power generation from natural gas. It seems that China has not only been increasing its year-round consumption of natural gas, but has also been building up storage capacity in order to increase availability during the winter peak. What appears to be happening is that China’s LNG demand is becoming more year-round, which should mitigate swings in spot pricing in Asia. Indeed, this has already occurred to some extent, with spot prices LNG-AS showing a milder decline to the 2018 low point from the prior winter’s peak than in previous years. The drop from the winter peak in January to the low in March was 39 percent, compared to 44.6 percent last year and 48.7 percent the year before. It’s also worth noting that spot LNG enjoyed a surprise summer peak, but this is more likely related to the unusually hot northern summer. Prices have been rising since late July and last week reached $11.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). This is coincidentally the peak price from the previous winter, which was reached in mid-January. This is a sign that spot LNG prices are likely to rise further in coming weeks, but may peak earlier than usual, assuming winter temperatures fall within the normal ranges.

Mustering all his 25-plus years of experience as a restructuring specialist, Brough needed their support to keep the credit lines open that underpinned the operations of what had once been Asia’s biggest commodity trading house. At the meeting in Amsterdam in late May, banks were shocked by a recently reported quarterly loss and were in no mood to keep supporting the company. “The atmosphere in the room was highly charged,” Brough told Reuters in an interview last week. “A number of them were already taking the decision that they wanted to exit the relationship,” said Brough, a former senior regional partner at KPMG in Hong Kong who helped wind up the Asian business of Lehman Brothers. The following week’s meeting with U.S. banks did not go much better, with Brough, 61, saying the banks “made it very clear that they wanted their secure debt repaid very, very quickly.” However, Brough, who managed China’s Sino-Forest after its $4 billion collapse in 2011, convinced the U.S. banks to give Noble a 120-day debt reprieve to sell its assets in the United States. From there, Brough, who took over from company founder Richard Elman, brought Noble back from among the biggest near-death corporate experiences in Asia. The company last week secured shareholder support for a $3.5 billion debt restructuring. In the 15 months between Brough’s appointment and last week’s deal, Noble dramatically downsized and reported a $4.9 billion loss for 2017, including a $2.1 billion valuation adjustment of its controversial derivatives contracts. By the time Brough became chairman, Noble had fended off two years of accusations by Iceberg Research that it had inflated its assets. Noble, which has stood by its accounts, later revealed Iceberg to be led by ex-Noble credit analyst Arnaud Vagner. When Brough took charge, Noble had lost 80 percent, or nearly $5 billion in market value, since Iceberg issued its first report in February 2015. Brough reckons he travelled 500,000 miles negotiating with hundreds of creditors and shareholders from Hong Kong and Singapore to New York, London and Amsterdam. Noble then hired investment bank Moelis & Company and lawyers Kirkland & Ellis, specialists in debt restructurings, the first sign of a possible wholesale restructure. PJT Partners and Comprador Ltd joined as financial advisors as Brough unveiled a strategic review of Noble. He brought together seven of its core trade finance banks at the Amsterdam meeting. Those banks included MUFG Bank, ING Bank and Rabobank. MUFG and ING declined to comment, while Rabobank said it does not comment on individual clients as a policy. “It was really one of those meetings that served as a kick-off meeting where everybody was put on alert,” said a person who participated in the talks. Noble’s rescue is viewed as one of the most complex debt restructurings due to its global trading business and the mix of creditors, from banks to different strata of bondholders and shareholders. “The dual needs of keeping Noble adequately capitalised with trade finance at a time when bankers were very nervous about relationships and when customers are also very nervous, meant that it was very, very challenging,” said Neil McDonald, a partner at Kirkland Ellis. When Noble won an extension for its credit facilities in June 2017, its shares surged 50 percent, but bond prices slid after it skipped an interest payment. “We had to call banks morning, noon and night to make sure they were comfortable with the restructuring,” said one advisor. For Brough, those summer months were the lowest point in the salvage operation, with “banks making aggressive requests” and there were times Noble could have run out of cash. “We found ourselves having to increase the margin that we were giving banks for our trade finance facilities and for our brokerage facilities,” he said. Noble agreed to sell its U.S. gas and power business to Mercuria for $248 million last July, a deal that also increased its trade finance access. Then in October, it announced the sale of its most capital-intensive business, oil trading, to Vitol for $1.2 billion. “The first glimmer of hope was when we announced the sale of the oil business,” said Brough, who will step down after the restructured company, focusing on coal and freight trading in Asia, kicks off later this year. In November, Noble formally announced the debt restructure and then agreed to a deal to give creditors 80 percent of the new company equity. Resistance from big shareholders such as Elman, and Goldilocks Investment Co, an Abu Dhabi-based fund, put it at risk. But in March, Noble’s creditors agreed to give existing shareholders a 20 percent equity share, up from a previous 10 percent, with an ultimatum - back the proposal or face insolvency. However, Iceberg’s Vagner says the new Noble will still be debt-heavy. “Most importantly, interest skyrockets. So, it will incur almost the same interest costs,” he told Reuters by email. Noble will also gain $800 million in trade financing and hedging facilities from ING and Deutsche Bank, the last two banks supporting the company, down from 70 banks five years ago.

2018-09-04,"WARSAW, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Poland plans to hold its first power capacity auction in November as part of a planned scheme in which electricity producers are paid for their readiness to provide electricity when needed. Poland generates most of its electricity from coal, mostly in outdated power plants, many of which need to be shut down in the coming years, raising risk for its security of supply. The government, which was elected in 2015 partly on promises to sustain the coal industry, has changed direction this year and acknowledged the need to increase its low-emission energy capacity. State-run utilities still have a few coal-fuelled power stations under construction or planned, however, and are facing trouble finding financing for them. Poland hopes the capacity market will help finance the projects and guarantee stable power supply, while critics say the scheme will only strengthen Poland’s reliance on coal and result in higher electricity prices. “The power market will ensure stable electricity supply to households and industry in the long-term horizon. It is also the most cost-effective way to ensure the right amount of power,” the energy ministry said in a statement. On November 15 utilities will compete to receive funds in 2021. On December 5 a capacity auction for 2022 will take place and on December 21 capacity for 2023, the ministry said. The energy minister has estimated the size of the capacity market scheme at 2-3 billion zlotys ($537-805 million). EU state aid regulators in February approved power back-up schemes in Germany, France and four other EU countries, saying that these would ensure security supply in the event of blackouts. Italy and Poland were also cleared to set up such schemes. $1 = 3.7245 zlotys

2018-09-04,"LONDON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Energy industry associations called on the European Council on Tuesday to extend an exemption from the EU’s value-added tax directive for power, gas and carbon emission transactions to protect the markets from fraud. Almost a decade ago, the EU’s Emissions Trading System suffered from value-added tax (VAT) fraud, where companies bought carbon permits in one country without paying VAT, and then sold in another adding tax to the price but pocketing that difference for themselves. The scam resulted in billions of euros being defrauded from European coffers. To combat the issue, the EU introduced an exemption from its VAT directive for electricity, gas and emissions trading transactions which will expire on Dec. 31 this year. The exemption enables member states to apply the so-called Domestic Reverse Charge Mechanism to these goods and services, which ensures the seller does not have to pay VAT, shifting the liability to the buyer. Eighteen industry associations, including Eurelectric, Eurogas and the International Emissions Trading Association, said VAT fraud remained a persistent threat to the integrity and operation of electricity, gas and carbon markets in Europe. It has been proposed that the exemption should continue until June 2022, but industry associations said it should be extended until at least Dec. 31, 2023.

2018-09-04,"Sept 4 (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Gordon on Tuesday barreled toward central U.S. Gulf Coast, where it was expected to become a hurricane and bring high winds and heavy rain to the region, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. The storm was gaining strength and was expected to become a hurricane as it comes ashore late on Tuesday near the border between Louisiana and Mississippi, and drop as much as 8 inches (20 cm) of rain in some areas of the U.S. South still reeling from hurricanes a year ago. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency, saying 200 Louisiana National Guardsmen were being deployed, along with 63 high-water trucks, 39 boats, and 4 helicopters. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency warned of storm surges of between 3 and 5 feet (1 and 1.5 meters) and told South Mississippi residents to be prepared to evacuate. Gordon was generating winds of 65 miles per hour (105 km per hour) on Tuesday as it steamed west-northwest at 17 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. Gordon was located about 280 miles (450 km) east-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River and was packing maximum sustained winds of 65 miles per hour (100kmh), the Miami-based weather forecaster said. By Monday afternoon the storm had passed over Florida’s southern tip. There were no reports of any injuries or deaths or any damages to buildings, said Alberto Moscoso, a spokesman for the Florida Division of Emergency Management. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell has declared a state of emergency for her city, closing all non-essential government offices on Tuesday. Last year, powerful hurricanes walloped Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, causing thousands of deaths, hundreds of billions of dollars worth of damage, massive power outages and devastation to hundreds of thousands of structures. At the mouth of the Mississippi River, around the area of New Orleans, the storm could generate a surge of up to 4 feet(1.2 metres) and smaller surges could hit coastland along other parts of the Gulf Coast, the Miami-based hurricane center said. U.S. oil producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp on Monday evacuated workers and shut production at two offshore oil platforms, and other companies with production and refining operations along the Gulf Coast said they were securing facilities. The U.S. Coast Guard also warned that the ports of New Orleans as well as Gulfport and Pascagoula, Mississippi, may have to close within 48 hours when gale force winds from Gordon are expected to arrive.

2018-09-04,"MAPUTO, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Mozambique’s private creditors face substantial losses from the government defaulting on its debt, ratings agency Moody’s said in a report published on Tuesday. Moody’s added in the report on the southern African country’s creditworthiness that government attempts at debt restructuring would likely extend beyond 2018 and that Mozambique’s fiscal strength was very low. Mozambique admitted in 2016 to $1.4 billion of previously undisclosed loans, many of which went on upgrading maritime and military security. The disclosure prompted the International Monetary Fund and foreign donors to cut off support, triggering a currency collapse and leading to a debt default. In March, the Mozambican government outlined three scenarios to overhaul its debt burden but Eurobond creditors rejected them, baulking at a second writedown in as many years. Moody’s rates Mozambique’s long-term foreign-currency debt at ‘Caa3’, deep into sub-investment grade.

2018-09-04,"BASRA, Iraq, Sept 4 (Reuters) - A protester has died and six more were wounded in clashes with security forces in Iraq’s southern oil hub Basra on Monday night, local health and security sources said. Protesters threw petrol bombs cocktails and stones at security forces, who responded by firing shots into the air and tear gas, securioty sources said. Hundreds of people had gathered near Basra’s provincial government headquarters to press demands for better public services and an end corruption. The crowd averaged about 600-700 people at its peak, but thinned throughout the night. Health sources said six protesters were taken to hospitals after sustaining injuries during the protests. The local head of Iraq’s Human Rights Commission, Mahdi al-Tamimi, called for an immediate investigation into the protester’s death. “We call on the Iraqi judiciary to open an immediate and urgent investigation into the killing of a demonstrator who was shot in the shoulder and subjected to electric shocks by security forces,” Tamimi said in a statement. Protests have swept cities in the long neglected south, Iraq’s Shi’ite Muslim heartland, over electricity outages during the hot Iraqi summer, a lack of jobs and proper government services, and entrenched graft. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi suspended the electricity minister last month and said on Monday that his government had begun punishing those responsible for poor services in Basra, Iraq’s second biggest city. But public anger has swelled at a time when politicians are struggling to form a new government after an inconclusive parliamentary election in May. Iraq’s top Shi’ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani has expressed support for the protests. On Friday, hundreds of protesters clashed with security forces in Basra as they tried to break into the provincial government headquarters.

2018-09-04,"PARIS, Sept 4 (Reuters) - The decommissioning of nuclear reactors is far outpacing the construction of new plants, as the pace of Chinese reactor building has slowed and several developing countries have scrapped nuclear projects, an industry report showed. In mid-2018, a total of 115 reactors were being decommissioned, about 70 percent of the world’s 173 reactors that have been permanently shut down, according to the annual World Nuclear Industry Status Report (WNISR). Only 19 reactor units have been fully decommissioned - of which 13 are in the United States, five in Germany, and one in Japan - and just 10 have been returned to greenfield sites. Many utilities prefer to let reactor cores cool off for decades on-site. “Unscrewing a nuclear installation by workers who know how it was put together makes more sense than cutting it apart decades later by people who know nothing about it,” said Mycle Schneider, lead author of the report. Decommissioning has become a major activity for many reactor builders and operators here, turning the costly process into a business opportunity. By comparison, 15 countries are currently building nuclear power plants, two more than in mid-2017, as newcomer countries Bangladesh and Turkey started building their first units. Belarus and United Arab Emirates (UAE) have nuclear new-build projects that are well under way. Nuclear new-build plans have been cancelled, including in Jordan, Malaysia and the United States, or postponed such as in Argentina, Indonesia and Kazakhstan, the WNISR report said. Last week, South Africa scrapped a plan here to add nearly 10 gigawatt (GW) of nuclear power by 2030. At the end of June, 50 reactors were being built worldwide — of which 16 are in China - with total capacity of 48.5 GW. Following the 2011 Fukushima disaster, the number of reactors under construction topped at 68 in 2013 but has trended downward since then. A total of 413 reactors were in operation in 31 countries in mid-2018, ten more than a year ago and compared with a peak of 438 in 2002. The increase was due to the restart of several reactors that had suffered long-term outages. The amount of electricity generated with nuclear energy worldwide rose one percent to 2,500 terawatt hours in 2017 and the share of nuclear power in power generation was 10.3 percent, virtually stable over the past five years.

2018-09-04,"(Reuters) - British packaging group DS Smith Plc (SMDS.L) said on Tuesday it sold more boxes in the first quarter at higher prices, helping it to recover from a rise in the cost of paper and pulp. The trading update from the FTSE-100 firm, which supplies corrugated cardboard, recycled paper and plastic packaging to firms including supplies to companies including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), gave no numbers on first quarter performance. But it said that its margins had improved and that it had also made “progress” on efforts to sell its plastics business, without giving further details.  “Recovery of input cost increases from earlier in the calendar year is in line with our expectations, with the consequent positive margin impact,” said DS Smith. The company has grown into one of the world’s leading recycled packaging producers through a series of acquisitions over the past decade and it has been reviewing its plastics business, which accounts for just 6-7 percent of turnover, as it increases its focus on production of recyclable fibre products.  It said in June it had heard interest from outside parties.  DS Smith last month raised about 1 billion pounds in capital via a rights issue to help fund its biggest-ever 2-billion-pound acquisition of Spanish rival Europac (PYCE.MC).  “Preparation for integration is continuing at pace and we look forward to welcoming Europac to the DS Smith group,” the company said, adding that it continues to expect deal completion in calendar fourth quarter this year.

2018-09-04,"* MSCI Asia ex-Japan rises 0.2 pct * Real estate, banking stocks lead China turnaround * Markets await possible new U.S. tariffs on China this week * European markets seen opening lower By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Asian shares rose on Tuesday, with markets reversing earlier losses, but investors were apprehensive as the Sino-U.S. trade dispute threatened to escalate this week and Argentina’s austerity measures rattled emerging markets. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.2 percent. Chinese blue-chips gained 0.9 percent after five straight days of losses, supported by real estate and banking stocks. Japan’s Nikkei fell less than 0.1 percent, while Australian shares ended 0.3 percent lower. Shares in Europe are expected to open lower on Tuesday following a mostly flat close on Monday. Spreadbetters see the FTSE 100 opening 0.09 percent lower at 7,498, the DAX opening 0.13 percent lower at 12,330, and the CAC 40 losing 0.09 percent to 5,409. U.S. stock market futures were higher on Tuesday, with S&P500 E-mini futures gaining 0.3 percent to 2909.25. “The majors are the focus today rather than emerging markets,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at Axi Trader in Sydney, noting that weak manufacturing data and the imposition of austerity measures in Argentina had drawn the market’s attention on Monday. “Today it’s back to where is the U.S. dollar going, and at the moment the vote in Asia has been it’s going to strengthen again,” he said. “It’s utterly consistent that the U.S. dollar is strengthening at the same time that U.S. futures are rallying if what we’ve seen over the last two months, which is money being allocated to the U.S. and away from other regions, continues.” The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was 0.14 percent higher at 95.272. The dollar was up 0.07 percent against the yen to 111.15 , while the euro was down 0.15 percent on the day at $1.1606. Manufacturing surveys published on Monday showed mounting stress on factories across Europe and Asia as the outlook for global trade dims. On Monday, Argentine President Mauricio Macri announced new taxes on exports and steep cuts to government spending in what he termed “emergency” measures to balance next year’s budget. The Argentine peso closed 3.14 percent weaker on Monday and is expected to face further pressure in coming days. Turkey’s central bank signalled on Monday it would take steps to combat “significant risks” to price stability, comments seen as hinting at interest rate hikes. The lira, which has lost 40 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar this year, was 0.3 percent stronger at 6.6000 to the dollar. U.S. President Donald Trump gave fresh impetus to trade worries at the weekend when he said there was no need to keep Canada in the North American Free Trade Agreement and warned Congress not to meddle in the trade talks. Trump was also reported to have said he is ready to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of imports from China as soon as a public comment period on the plan ends on Thursday. “Markets are paying a little bit of attention to (Trump’s tariff threats) and wondering what might happen to European autos and, at the end of the day, what will happen with the Canadian side of NAFTA as well. There’s a lot of uncertainty there,” McKenna said. And in a sign of new market risks, a Reuters poll pointed to a one-in-four chance that Britain will leave the European Union in March without a deal. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 2.8640 percent versus its U.S. close of 2.853 percent on Friday. The two-year yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 2.633 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.629 percent last week. In commodity markets, U.S. oil prices rose past the $70 per barrel mark, with production coming under pressure as two Gulf of Mexico oil platforms were evacuated in preparation for a hurricane. U.S. crude was 0.5 percent higher at $70.15 per barrel. Brent crude was flat at $78.16 per barrel after earlier trading lower on news that India had permitted its state refiners to import Iranian oil if Iran arranged tankers and insurance. Gold was slightly lower as the dollar strengthened, with spot gold traded at $1,199.46 per ounce. Reporting by Andrew Galbraith; Editing by Eric Meijer & Shri

2018-09-04,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - In May 2017, Paul Brough had just assumed the chairmanship of Noble Group (NOBG.SI) and immediately faced a room full of angry bankers demanding their money back from the struggling commodity trader.  Mustering all his 25-plus years of experience as a restructuring specialist, Brough needed their support to keep the credit lines open that underpinned the operations of what had once been Asia’s biggest commodity trading house. At the meeting in Amsterdam in late May, banks were shocked by a recently reported quarterly loss and were in no mood to keep supporting the company. “The atmosphere in the room was highly charged,” Brough told Reuters in an interview last week. “A number of them were already taking the decision that they wanted to exit the relationship,” said Brough, a former senior regional partner at KPMG in Hong Kong who helped wind up the Asian business of Lehman Brothers. The following week’s meeting with U.S. banks did not go much better, with Brough, 61, saying the banks “made it very clear that they wanted their secure debt repaid very, very quickly.” However, Brough, who managed China’s Sino-Forest after its $4 billion collapse in 2011, convinced the U.S. banks to give Noble a 120-day debt reprieve to sell its assets in the United States. From there, Brough, who took over from company founder Richard Elman, brought Noble back from among the biggest near-death corporate experiences in Asia. The company last week secured shareholder support for a $3.5 billion debt restructuring. In the 15 months between Brough’s appointment and last week’s deal, Noble dramatically downsized and reported a $4.9 billion loss for 2017, including a $2.1 billion valuation adjustment of its controversial derivatives contracts. By the time Brough became chairman, Noble had fended off two years of accusations by Iceberg Research that it had inflated its assets. Noble, which has stood by its accounts, later revealed Iceberg to be led by ex-Noble credit analyst Arnaud Vagner. When Brough took charge, Noble had lost 80 percent, or nearly $5 billion in market value, since Iceberg issued its first report in February 2015. Brough reckons he travelled 500,000 miles negotiating with hundreds of creditors and shareholders from Hong Kong and Singapore to New York, London and Amsterdam.Noble then hired investment bank Moelis & Company and lawyers Kirkland & Ellis, specialists in debt restructurings,  the first sign of a possible wholesale restructure. PJT Partners and Comprador Ltd joined as financial advisors as Brough unveiled a strategic review of Noble. He brought together seven of its core trade finance banks at the Amsterdam meeting. Those banks included MUFG Bank, ING Bank and Rabobank. MUFG and ING declined to comment, while Rabobank did not respond to a Reuters query. “It was really one of those meetings that served as a kick-off meeting where everybody was put on alert,” said a person who participated in the talks. For a related graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2NaUFXq Noble’s rescue is viewed as one of the most complex debt restructurings due to its global trading business and the mix of creditors, from banks to different strata of bondholders and shareholders. “The dual needs of keeping Noble adequately capitalised with trade finance at a time when bankers were very nervous about relationships and when customers are also very nervous, meant that it was very, very challenging,” said Neil McDonald, a partner at Kirkland Ellis. When Noble won an extension for its credit facilities in June 2017, its shares surged 50 percent, but bond prices slid after it skipped an interest payment. “We had to call banks morning, noon and night to make sure they were comfortable with the restructuring,” said one advisor.    For Brough, those summer months were the lowest point in the salvage operation, with “banks making aggressive requests” and there were times Noble could have run out of cash. “We found ourselves having to increase the margin that we were giving banks for our trade finance facilities and for our brokerage facilities,” he said. Noble agreed to sell its U.S. gas and power business to Mercuria for $248 million last July, a deal that also increased its trade finance access. Then in October, it announced the sale of its most capital-intensive business, oil trading, to Vitol for $1.2 billion.    “The first glimmer of hope was when we announced the sale of the oil business,” said Brough, who will step down after the restructured company, focusing on coal and freight trading in Asia, kicks off later this year. In November, Noble formally announced the debt restructure and then agreed to a deal to give creditors 80 percent of the new company equity. Resistance from big shareholders such as Elman, and Goldilocks Investment Co, an Abu Dhabi-based fund, put it at risk. But in March, Noble’s creditors agreed to give existing shareholders a 20 percent equity share, up from a previous 10 percent, with an ultimatum - back the proposal or face insolvency. However, Iceberg’s Vagner says the new Noble will still be debt-heavy. “Most importantly, interest skyrockets. So, it will incur almost the same interest costs,” he told Reuters by email. Noble will also gain $800 million in trade financing and hedging facilities from ING and Deutsche Bank, the last two banks supporting the company, down from 70 banks five years ago.

2018-09-04,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - China appears set to once again boost its purchases of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for the northern winter, but unlike last year’s rush, this time the process is likely to be more organised and stable. In recent weeks there have been several indicators that China is planning on increasing the use of natural gas in winter heating, replacing boilers that use more polluting coal. Curbing winter air pollution has been a major aim of the authorities in Beijing, but they were stung by criticism last year that the switch to natural gas was made too quickly and the resulting shortages left some people without adequate heating. A sign that Beijing is putting more effort into ensuring sufficient natural gas supplies came last week when Vice-Minister of Finance Liu Wei was quoted by the Communist Party newspaper as saying that gas supply agreements must be in place when converting coal-fired boilers to the cleaner fuel. These comments were followed by an announcement by state-owned oil and gas major Sinopec that it is putting in place a range of measures to boost winter natural gas supplies, including increasing purchases of spot LNG cargoes and boosting distribution. (Graphic: reut.rs/2wH8G4z) It’s often a challenge with China to work out exactly how official pronouncements will translate into real world action, but in all likelihood China is going to increase LNG imports in coming months. This will come on top of an already strong year so far, with both official customs data and vessel-tracking data compiled by Thomson Reuters showing impressive gains. China imported about 4.55 million tonnes of LNG in August, the highest since January, according to the shipping data. Imports for the first eight months totalled 32.2 million tonnes, up 46.4 percent from the same period last year. Customs data for the January to July period shows imports of about 28.05 million tonnes, up 47.6 percent from the same period in 2017. In addition to the surge in import volumes, the data show that China’s LNG purchases haven’t shown as much of the seasonal swings of past years, with a strong winter peak followed by lulls in spring and summer, before picking up in autumn. In the 2017-18 winter, imports in December and January were some 72 percent higher than those in July 2017. However, imports in July this year, were only 17.4 percent below the previous winter peak months of December and January, indicating that LNG demand has remained robust throughout the year so far. There was a hotter-than-usual summer in China, which boosted electricity demand for air-conditioning, but this had more of an impact on coal demand, given limited power generation from natural gas. It seems that China has not only been increasing its year-round consumption of natural gas, but has also been building up storage capacity in order to increase availability during the winter peak. What appears to be happening is that China’s LNG demand is becoming more year-round, which should mitigate swings in spot pricing in Asia. Indeed, this has already occurred to some extent, with spot prices showing a milder decline to the 2018 low point from the prior winter’s peak than in previous years. The drop from the winter peak in January to the low in March was 39 percent, compared to 44.6 percent last year and 48.7 percent the year before. It’s also worth noting that spot LNG enjoyed a surprise summer peak, but this is more likely related to the unusually hot northern summer. Prices have been rising since late July and last week reached $11.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). This is coincidentally the peak price from the previous winter, which was reached in mid-January. This is a sign that spot LNG prices are likely to rise further in coming weeks, but may peak earlier than usual, assuming winter temperatures fall within the normal ranges.  The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.

2018-09-04,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - - Governments are unprepared for a crucial climate change meeting in Poland later this year aimed at ensuring the full implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement, Fiji Prime Minister Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama said on Tuesday at the opening of climate talks in Bangkok.     The talks in the Thai capital come ahead of a gathering in Katowice, Poland in December, when government ministers will meet to agree rules for the 2015 Paris climate accord. U.S. President Donald Trump, who in the past has described climate change as a hoax, pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement in 2017, saying it favoured other countries and was disadvantageous to the United States. The Paris Agreement set a sweeping goal of ending the fossil fuel era this century, but the text was vague on details.    Bainimarama, who is also president of the COP23 or 23rd annual Conference of the Parties to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said that without guidelines countries “risk chaos at Katowice and the possibility of yet another delay in the urgent work of combating climate change.”     “In three months’ time we will be in Katowice, and frankly, we are not ready. I don’t think that statement should surprise anyone in this room,” he said in an opening statement.     After failing to make enough progress in Bonn in May, the Bangkok summit is seen as a last shot before Katowice.     “This is not just an additional session. It is an urgent session,” Bainimarama said.     “Would any of us like to return to our people and tell them that we had the chance to do something truly great and truly necessary for the world we will pass to our children, but that we lacked the will to get it done?” he asked.     “Around our world the affects of climate change are becoming more evident and more severe. No country or region is spared and the effects in one region are felt in others,” he added.     He urged delegates to come up with clear guidelines.     On Sunday, Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), told Reuters governments are not on track to meet a goal of the Paris agreement of capping temperatures well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) before the end of the century.     Espinosa said she hopes a draft text for negotiation on the “rule book’ of the 2015 agreement will emerge at the end of the week-long Bangkok talks.

2018-09-04,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela will hike the price of its heavily subsidized gasoline by October, President Nicolas Maduro said on Monday, as the crisis-stricken government seeks to shore up its coffers amid hyperinflation that is accelerating a broad economic collapse.  Despite the crisis, fuel prices are set so low that the equivalent of $1 buys nearly 400,000 gallons of fuel. That cripples the state’s hard currency earnings and drives a lucrative smuggling trade.      The government on Tuesday will launch a new payment system using a state-backed identification card in border states to limit smuggling, Maduro said, and will increase prices to international levels once that system is in place.  “During the course of September, October, once that system is working, we will establish the subsidy systems and the price of gasoline will be set at the international price,” he said during a televised broadcast.  Maduro did not offer additional details.  Any increase would mark the first time in 20 years that Venezuela has significantly raised fuel prices, which have been a sensitive issue ever since riots broke out in 1989 in response to austerity measures that included higher gasoline prices.  Government regulations have kept prices steady at the pump despite inflation that is expected to hit 1,000,000 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Drivers have for years paid for fuel in loose change, often tipping service station workers more than they pay to fill their tanks.  Experts estimate Venezuela - where shortages of food and medicine have fueled hunger, disease and a mass exodus of citizens - loses at least $5 billion a year as a result of not selling gasoline at international prices.  Critics have questioned how Venezuelans, whose salaries have been destroyed by unchecked inflation, could afford to pay the same fuel prices as those facing drivers in the United States.  The new system revolves around a state-backed ID known as the Fatherland Card, which Maduro says is meant to provide better services to citizens through data collection.  Opposition critics say the identification cards are meant to channel subsidies and scarce food and medical services to government supporters, while withholding them from Maduro’s adversaries.

2018-09-04,"* MSCI Asia ex-Japan down 0.3 pct * Dollar index gains as EM fears hit peso, lira * New U.S. tariffs on China could come as early as Thursday By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Asian shares fell and the dollar turned higher on Tuesday as the trade dispute between the United States and China threatened to escalate this week, and as emergency austerity measures in Argentina underscored the turbulence gripping emerging markets. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.3 percent. Chinese blue-chips also fell 0.3 percent, reversing earlier gains. Japan’s Nikkei slid less than 0.1 percent, while Australian shares were 0.4 percent lower ahead of a central bank policy meeting. On Monday, European shares ended mostly flat, though a weak British pound helped to lift London’s blue-chip FTSE almost 1 percent. U.S. markets were closed for Labor Day. But U.S. stock market futures edged higher on Tuesday, with S&P500 E-mini futures gaining 0.1 percent to 2905.5. “The majors are the focus today rather than emerging markets,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at Axi Trader in Sydney, noting that weak manufacturing data and the imposition of austerity measures in Argentina had drawn the market’s attention on Monday. “Today it’s back to where is the U.S. dollar going, and at the moment the vote in Asia has been it’s going to strengthen again,” he said. “It’s utterly consistent that the U.S. dollar is strengthening at the same time that U.S. futures are rallying if what we’ve seen over the last two months, which is money being allocated to the U.S. and away from other regions, continues.” The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was 0.1 percent higher at 95.253. The dollar was up 0.05 percent against the yen to 111.12 , while the euro was down 0.2 percent on the day at $1.1599. Manufacturing surveys released on Monday showed mounting stress on factories across Europe and Asia as the outlook for global trade dims. Also on Monday, Argentine President Mauricio Macri announced new taxes on exports and steep cuts to government spending in what he termed “emergency” measures to balance next year’s budget. The Argentine peso closed 3.14 percent weaker on Monday and is expected to face further pressure in coming days. Turkey’s central bank signalled on Monday it would take steps to combat “significant risks” to price stability, comments seen as hinting at interest rate hikes. The lira, which has lost 40 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar this year, was 0.3 percent weaker at 6.6400 to the dollar. U.S. President Donald Trump gave fresh impetus to trade worries at the weekend when he said there was no need to keep Canada in the North American Free Trade Agreement and warned Congress not to meddle with the trade talks. Trump was also reported to have said he is ready to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of imports from China as soon as a public comment period on the plan ends on Thursday. “Markets are paying a little bit of attention to (Trump’s tariff threats) and wondering what might happen to European autos and, at the end of the day, what will happen with the Canadian side of NAFTA as well. There’s a lot of uncertainty there,” McKenna said. And in a sign of new market risks, a Reuters poll pointed to a one-in-four chance that Britain will leave the European Union in March without a deal. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 2.8622 percent versus its U.S. close of 2.853 percent on Friday. The two-year yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 2.633 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.629 percent last week. In commodity markets, U.S. oil prices rose past the $70 per barrel mark, with production coming under pressure as two Gulf of Mexico oil platforms were evacuated in preparation for a hurricane. U.S. crude was 0.3 higher at $70.04 per barrel. But Brent crude fell 0.1 percent to $78.08 per barrel after India permitted its state refiners to import Iranian oil if Iran arranges tankers and insurance. Gold was slightly lower as the dollar strengthened, with spot gold traded at $1,199.46 per ounce. Reporting by Andrew Galbraith; Editing by Eric Meijer & Shri

2018-09-04,"TOKYO, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Japan issued evacuation advisories for almost 300,000 people and cancelled hundreds of flights in the face of strong winds and heavy rain as typhoon Jebi roared north and was set to make landfall later on Tuesday. Jebi - whose name means “swallow” in Korean - is the latest harsh weather to hit Japan this summer following deadly rains, landslides, floods and record-breaking heat that killed hundreds of people. The storm was bearing down on western Japan and set to make landfall on Shikoku, the smallest main island, before raking across the western part of the largest main island, Honshu, and Osaka, the nation’s second-largest city, later on Tuesday. Evacuation advisories were issued for some 280,000 people as the wind and rain began picking up. Television footage showed waves pounding the coastline amid warnings that high tides later on Tuesday would coincide with the storm’s passage. Wind gusts of up to 166 km/h (103 mph) were recorded in one part of Shikoku, with forecasts for gusts as high as 216 km/h (135 mph). Around 87 mm (3.4 inches) of rain drenched some areas in an hour on Tuesday morning, with as much as 500 mm (20 inches) set to fall in the 24 hours to Wednesday morning. Nearly 600 flights were cancelled, along with scores of ferries and trains, NHK public television said. The Shinkansen bullet train was operating on a reduced schedule and Universal Studios Japan, a popular amusement park near Osaka, was closed. The capital, Tokyo, will be far from the centre of the storm but was set for heavy rains and high winds by the end of Tuesday. Jebi’s predicted course will bring it close to parts of western Japan hit by rains and flooding that killed more than 200 people in July. However, it was set to speed up after it makes landfall, minimising the amount of rain that will fall in one place. Reporting by Elaine Lies
