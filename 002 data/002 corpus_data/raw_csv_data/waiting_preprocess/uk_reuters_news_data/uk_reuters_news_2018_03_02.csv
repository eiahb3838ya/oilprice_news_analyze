2018-03-02,"NEW YORK, March 2 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - I mplementing the Paris climate agreement by investing trillions of dollars to slow greenhouse gas emissions would be far cheaper than paying the costs of people sickened by polluted air, scientists said on Friday. Governments worldwide could save $54 trillion in health care by investing less than half that amount in green projects by mid-century, researchers said in a study published in The Lancet Planetary Health, an online academic journal. Such an investment would result in 30 million fewer premature deaths related to air pollution, said the study’s co-author Jon Sampedro, a researcher at Spain’s Basque Centre for Climate Change. The Paris agreement reached in 2015 by nearly 200 countries committed to curbing greenhouse emissions enough to keep the global hike in temperatures “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times while “pursuing efforts” for a far tougher 1.5 C ceiling. A United Nations draft report earlier this year projected that unless governments take unprecedented measures, the global temperature rise is on track to exceed the accord’s tougher target. Authors of the study said their calculations of steep savings could convince policy-makers to adopt more aggressive policies to curb human emissions of greenhouse gasses that include carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. “We hope (that) ... might help policymakers move towards adopting more ambitious climate policies and measures to reduce air pollution,” said Anil Markandya, a professor at the Basque Centre, in a statement. The team of researchers from Spain, the United States and Italy ran computer models that combined future estimates of emissions, air pollution-related deaths and healthcare benefits for the entire world. Achieving the highest levels of savings would require China and India making the largest joint investment, some $9 trillion, to tackle climate change, the study said. The two countries would then save most by having healthier populations, it said. Together China and India account for about a third of global emissions, according to the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based think tank. The Paris agreement allowed nations to set their own targets to slow climate change, with no sanctions for non-compliance. President Donald Trump announced last year he was pulling the United States, the world’s second biggest emitter of heat-trapping carbon dioxide, out of the deal. China is the biggest such emitter. His decision isolates the United States as the only country opposed to the pact.

2018-03-02,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - China delayed a U.S. request for a United Nations Security Council committee to blacklist 33 ships, 27 shipping companies, and a Taiwan man for violating international sanctions on North Korea, diplomats said on Friday. The United States submitted the request a week ago, a move it says is “aimed at shutting down North Korea’s illicit maritime smuggling activities to obtain oil and sell coal.”     The U.N. request coincided with the United States imposing its largest package of unilateral sanctions against North Korea on Friday, intensifying pressure on Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and missile programmes. China did not give a reason for placing a hold on the U.S. request. A hold can be lifted and is often used when a Security Council member wants more information, but sometimes it can lead to a permanent blocking of a proposed blacklisting. The Security Council North Korea sanctions committee works on the basis of unanimity. If agreed, the 33 ships proposed by the United States, 19 of which are North Korean vessels, would be subjected to a global port entry ban. Countries would also be required to deregister the 14 ships that are not North Korean. The 27 proposed companies and the one individual would be subjected to an asset freeze.  The U.N. Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, banning exports including coal, iron, lead, textiles and seafood, and capping imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products. In October the United States proposed eight ships for U.N. designation for smuggling banned cargo from North Korea. The committee agreed to ban four ships from ports globally, while Washington postponed a bid to blacklist the remaining four.  In December the United States proposed 10 ships for blacklisting, the committee agreed to designate four, while diplomats said China objected listing the remaining six.

2018-03-02,"(Recasts; adds industry, analyst, government comments) By David Ljunggren and Leah Schnurr MEXICO CITY/OTTAWA, March 2 (Reuters) - Canadian officials are bombarding U.S. counterparts with calls to secure an exemption on potential steel and aluminium tariffs and threatening retaliation, but Ottawa has limited leverage to counter the plan, industry insiders and analysts said on Friday. Simultaneously mulling retaliatory targets and insisting the tariffs may never happen, trade officials are working the phones but will not identify potential sanctions to avoid “painting oneself into a corner”, according to one well-placed Canadian source. A second Canadian source familiar with the issue said officials are making the point that the steel and aluminum industries are so integrated that an exemption for Canada, the largest supplier of both steel and aluminum to the United States, is obvious but admitted leveraging person-to-person contacts may not matter in the end. “As we have all seen in this particular context with this particular administration, there is one guy who is going to decide at the end,” said the second source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, referring to U.S. President Donald Trump. Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday that tariffs would be “absolutely unacceptable” and would cause significant and serious disruption to the market on both side of the border. Retaliatory options all risk hurting Canada as much as they do the United States, which has an economy 10 times the size of its northern neighbor. “Retaliation is equivalent to grabbing yourself by the throat, putting the gun to your head and saying, ‘Stop it or the dummy buys it’,” said trade lawyer Milos Barutciski at law firm Bennett Jones. Crops, meat and energy trade in both directions across the Canada-U.S. border, making it difficult to retaliate against U.S. products in those industries. Canada imports U.S. soymeal, for example, to feed pigs, and then trucks some of the herds to the United States for fattening and slaughter. “The risk for agriculture in Canada and throughout North America, is if we get caught up in a trade war we compromise the competitiveness of the whole industry,” said Brian Innes, president of Canadian Agri-Food Trade Alliance, whose members include meat, grain and oilseed growers and companies. Threatening to retaliate through energy products is also fraught. Canadian heavy oil producers depend on U.S. refineries to buy much of their output. Further hampering Canada’s ability to hit back, the provision of national security cited by Trump in announcing the tariff means Canada does not automatically get the retaliatory right under WTO rules, Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Economics, said in a research note. The last time Canada prepared for a trade war with the United States, in 2013 over contentious meat labeling rules, it targeted dozens of seemingly random American exports, from cherries and chocolate, to wine and office chairs. The goods had been chosen to hit where key U.S. legislators live, rather than inflict broader economic pain. U.S. industry groups and voters pressed elected officials to avoid retaliation that would have especially hurt their own districts. “They tried the charm offensive, it didn’t do the trick,” said Gerry Ritz, who was Canadian agriculture minister in the Conservative government of the time. “They’ve spent a lot of time and money wandering around down there but haven’t hit the right people. “You can’t do a shotgun approach, you need more of a one-on-one sniper approach.” (Additional reporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg; Writing by Andrea Hopkins; Editing by Amran Abocar and Daniel Wallis)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-canada-tariffs/update-1-canada-retaliation-in-u-s-tariff-row-like-grabbing-your-own-throat-idUKL2N1QK1S2,02 Mar 2018,"Canadian officials

2018-03-02,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks on Wall Street rebounded on Friday as investors who were initially spooked by the prospect of a global trade war backed off those concerns on the notion that President Donald Trump was just rattling sabres as a negotiating tactic. Trump’s pledge on Thursday to impose hefty tariffs on steel and aluminium imports sparked concerns about tit-for-tat  retaliation that could wound a healthy U.S. economy that is poised to deliver record corporate earnings.  An ensuing rout in risk assets knocked the dollar from multi-week highs and briefly pushed all three major U.S. stock indexes into negative territory for the year as fears of a global protectionist wave would be negative for the greenback. “Absolutely unacceptable” said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about the potential imposition of any U.S. steel and aluminium tariffs. However, investors decided a full-blown global trade war was not in the making and that Trump was only grabbing people’s attention about the U.S. trade deficit, said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors in New York.   “For a real estate guy like that, you pound the podium, you rattle some sabres, you get everybody’s attention and then you negotiate back to some reasonable midpoint,” Orlando said.  The tariffs are unlikely to significantly hurt corporate America’s overall earnings, according to stock market strategists, who did not immediately adjust their profit estimates following Trump’s announcement. MSCI’s gauge of stock performance in 47 countries .MIWD00000PUS pared losses of 1 percent to close little changed.  The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rebounded from losses of 1 percent or more to close higher. The Dow, however, ended lower and remained in negative territory for the year so far. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 70.92 points, or 0.29 percent, to 24,538.06. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 13.58 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,691.25, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 77.31 points, or 1.08 percent, to 7,257.87. Earlier in Europe and Asia, where markets were closed when Trump's tariff proposal was announced on Thursday, major equity indexes fell more than 2 percent. The Nikkei index .N225 tumbled 2.5 percent in Tokyo and the Hang Seng index .HSI fell 1.5 percent in Hong Kong. Asian steelmakers were hit hard, with South Korea’s Posco (005490.KS) down 3.6 percent and Japan’s Nippon Steel (5401.T) off 3.8 percent. Toyota Motor (7203.T) shares slid 2.4 percent after the company said tariffs would substantially raise production costs and the price of cars and trucks sold in America. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 of leading regional shares lost 2.13 percent to close at 1,437.14. The sell-off in European stocks weighed particularly on the export-oriented German DAX index .GDAXI, which fell 2.27 percent to a six-month low. ArcelorMittal SA (MT.AS), the world’s biggest steel maker, fell 3.7 percent while euro zone automakers and parts companies .SXAP fell 2.29 percent. Investors feared that Trump’s move could herald the tough trade actions he had promised during the electoral campaign as a way to incentivize companies to just “buy American, hire American,” said John Doyle, vice president of dealing and trading at Tempus Inc. in Washington. “The U.S. dollar may face some scrutiny and as a result struggle to hold on to recent gains,” Doyle said.  The dollar index .DXY fell 0.42 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.5 percent to $1.2328. The Japanese yen firmed 0.50 percent versus the greenback at 105.72 per dollar. The Mexican peso, which was lower during most of the session, gained 0.15 percent at 18.80. The Canadian dollar fell 0.39 percent versus the greenback at 1.29 per dollar. U.S. Treasury yields rose as markets priced in the risk of a trade war. The 10-year yield bounced back from a three-week low as the Bank of Japan’s chief hinted at a possible exit from its ultra-easy policies if inflation hits its target in fiscal year 2019. The benchmark 10-year note US10YT=RR fell 18/32 in price to push its yield up to 2.8679 percent. Germany’s benchmark 10-year Bund yield DE10YT=RR dropped as low as 0.606, its lowest level since late January, before inching up to 0.648 percent. Oil prices rose as Wall Street stocks bounced off session lows, but crude benchmarks posted a decline for the week, the first weekly decline in three weeks, on fears that U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium could squeeze economic growth, and as U.S. crude inventories climbed. U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 26 cents to settle at $61.25 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 settled up 54 cents at $64.37 per barrel.

2018-03-02,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Friday as Wall Street stocks bounced off session lows, but benchmark crude futures posted their first weekly decline in three weeks on fears U.S. plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum could squeeze economic growth and jitters about rising U.S. crude production. On Thursday, oil followed the stock market lower after President Donald Trump said he would impose hefty tariffs to protect U.S. producers. Investors feared the move would spark a trade war. The U.S. oil and gas industry slammed the tariff plan, saying it would kill energy jobs by raising costs for big infrastructure projects. Oil slid along with equities again early on Friday, but oil rebounded with U.S. stocks as the S&P 500 index .SPX and the Nasdaq .IXIC moved into positive territory.

For the week, Brent was down about 4 percent and WTI down more than 3 percent. The premium of the Brent front-month contract over WTI WTCLc1-LCOc1 briefly fell to its lowest since August before edging up by the market close. “Tariffs brought concerns that economic growth will be unable to boost demand,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy. Crude prices remained under pressure from concerns that U.S. production may be high enough to offset output cuts from OPEC and Russia, he said.  On Wednesday, the government reported that U.S. crude stocks USOILC=ECI rose faster than expected while gasoline inventories posted a surprisingly large increase. [EIA/S] “We are being driven by the pickup in U.S. inventories and in general terms the market went a bit too far, too soon,” said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney. “Then we have the volatility in the U.S. dollar and the implications of the tariff news to factor in,” he said.

2018-03-02,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - More than three years after the collapse in oil prices, energy-producing states such as Alaska, Oklahoma and Louisiana continue to struggle with budget shortfalls, and fiscal 2019 is no different as lawmakers seek permanent revenue solutions.     States that benefited from the energy boom were left reeling when prices collapsed in mid-2014, leading to a continuous scramble to make up for lost oil-related revenue. Alaska, which depended heavily on revenues from oil activity, dealt with the sudden fiscal pressures by tapping into reserve funds and cutting spending. Some say the fiscal uncertainty surrounding the state has impacted private sector investment. The state’s proposed capital budget for fiscal 2019 is $150 million, down from nearly $2 billion in fiscal 2013, a drop of more than 90 percent. It still faces a budget deficit of $2.5 billion for next year. “Less state funding doesn’t instill a lot of confidence in private investors,” said John MacKinnon, the executive director of the Associated General Contractors of Alaska. As a result, employees in the state’s construction industry are working fewer hours, MacKinnon said, noting that carpenters’ hours were down by 20 percent in 2017 versus 2016. The amount of money invested by public and private sources in construction projects in Alaska has decreased from $8.82 billion in 2014 to a projected $6.57 billion in 2018, according to data from the Institute of Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Alaska Anchorage. And the number of Alaskans employed in the construction business statewide, excluding public and self-employed workers, has also decreased from an average of 17,075 workers in 2014 to a projected average of 14,962 in 2017, the data said. Alaska has also not authorized any new General Obligation bond issuance since 2012 when voters approved of $449.9 million of debt, according to the state’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB). As of June 30, $110.35 million of that debt was unissued, the office said. “The fiscal situation is such that taking on additional liabilities is not a smart thing to do at the moment,” said Scott Goldsmith, professor emeritus of economics at ISER. Barring any legislative actions, the state’s constitutional budget reserve — its primary reserve account — could be empty by April 2019, said Pat Pitney, the OMB’s director. Pitney said she also feels that private investment has been pulling back from the state.  “We have businessmen saying, ‘I’m not investing in Alaska because there’s uncertainty, and I’m putting my money somewhere else or I’m going to wait,’” she said.  In Louisiana and Oklahoma, legislators also face budget deficits for the next fiscal year, having attempted to fill past shortfalls with temporary tax increases and one-time fixes, respectively. Louisiana faces a fiscal cliff totaling roughly $1 billion because of a sunset on temporary tax increases adopted in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 and set to expire in mid-2018. The decline in the oil industry in part drove the tax increases, said Manfred Dix, an economist with the state’s Office of Planning and Budget. “We cannot depend on crude oil dramatically increasing again,” Dix said. Oklahoma’s challenges stem from a combination of low oil prices and extensive one-time actions from the legislature, said Marcy Block, an analyst at Fitch Ratings. The state faces a deficit of about $167 million. Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin has criticized the legislature in the past for failing to find long-term solutions to recurring deficits.  While oil prices have ticked up in the last half year, analysts and government employees reached by Reuters do not expect a return to their 2014 levels anytime soon — if at all.  U.S. crude CLc1 last clocked $61.18 per barrel, far below the more than $100 per barrel price it hit in 2014. Credit agency S&P Global Ratings said on Tuesday that oil-producing states in 2018 should experience positive economic growth. However, Fitch said on Jan. 25 that while oil prices and production have edged higher, states seem to be tempering their revenue and price forecasts. “We are going to be low for a while, and they (states) need to align their budgets to that fact,” Fitch’s Block said.

2018-03-02,"(Adds company comment) March 2 (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc said on Friday the first vessel carrying liquefied natural gas from its newly constructed Cove Point LNG export terminal in Maryland left the facility, another sign of growing U.S. prowess as an oil and gas producer. The LNG tanker Gemmata left fully loaded, according to energy data provider Genscape, which said it observed the loading of the vessel through its cameras set up to watch the facility. Dominion said it spent about $4 billion to add export facilities at Cove Point, long an LNG import terminal on Chesapeake Bay. The facility is still undergoing final commissioning, the company said. Cove Point is the second big LNG export terminal in the Lower 48 U.S. states after Cheniere Energy Inc’s Sabine Pass terminal in Louisiana, which exported its first cargo in February 2016. After decades of importing massive amounts of gas, the United States became an exporter of the fuel in 2017 for the first time in 60 years due to record U.S. gas production from shale fields. The United States is expected to become the world’s third- biggest LNG exporter by capacity in 2018, furthering President Donald Trump’s goal of American energy dominance by exporting U.S. oil and gas to help create jobs at home and provide more security to the nation’s allies around the world. U.S. LNG export capacity is expected to rise to 10.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) by the end of 2020 from 3.8 bcfd today. Cove Point is designed to liquefy about 0.75 bcfd of gas. One bcfd can power about 5 million homes. Dominion said Royal Dutch Shell Plc took the initial LNG cargo from Cove Point. Gemmata is a Shell vessel. The company did not say where Gemmata was heading. Reuters shipping data said it was available for orders. Another vessel, the Methane Spirit, is also headed for Cove Point, according to Reuters shipping data.

2018-03-02,"(Adds U.S. market open, byline, dateline; previous LONDON) * Trump steel, aluminum tariff plan raises trade war fears * US debt yields fall as trade jitters dwarf inflation fear * Trump tweets “trade wars are good, and easy to win” By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, March 2 (Reuters) - World equity markets slid further and the U.S. dollar dropped to its lowest in more than two years against the yen on Friday as concern over a global trade war added to investor uncertainties about rising inflation and the outlook for U.S. interest rates. President Donald Trump’s pledge on Thursday to impose hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports raised the prospect of a global trade war that could prove damaging to a healthy U.S. economy that is poised to deliver record corporate earnings. The rout in risk assets knocked the dollar from multi-week highs as the specter of protectionism spurred fear of retaliation by other nations, which would be negative for the greenback. Major equity indices in Europe fell more than 2 percent, as they were closed when Trump’s tariff proposal was announced, while the Nikkei index fell 2.5 percent in Tokyo and the Hang Seng index fell 1.5 percent in Hong Kong. Asian steelmakers were hit hard, with South Korea’s Posco down 3.3 percent and Japan’s Nippon Steel off 3.8 percent. Toyota Motor shares slid 2.4 percent after it said tariffs would substantially raise production costs and the price of cars and trucks sold in America. Trump’s move could herald the tough actions on trade he had promised during the electoral campaign as a way to incentivize companies to just “buy American, hire American,” said John Doyle, vice president of dealing and trading at Tempus Inc. in Washington. “The U.S. dollar may face some scrutiny and as a result struggle to hold on to recent gains,” Doyle said. “It is the type of scenario that is unprecedented, thus wild swings may occur as this is digested and analyzed the next few days.” Volatility will continue until investors get some clarity on the path of U.S. interest rates, inflation, global trade policy and the international response, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. “Investors do not like uncertain outcomes, they just don’t,” Arone said. “If we could just eliminate some of this noise, there’s a really healthy underlying stock market.” MSCI’s gauge of stock performance in 47 countries fell 0.59 percent while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares lost 2.07 percent to close at a preliminary 1,438.01. ArcelorMittal SA, the world’s biggest steelmaker, fell 3.7 percent while euro zone automakers and parts companies fell 2.29 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 252.85 points, or 1.03 percent, to 24,356.13. The S&P 500 lost 7.59 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,670.08 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.31 points, or 0.02 percent, to 7,179.25. The dollar index fell 0.38 percent, with the euro up 0.42 percent to $1.2318. The Japanese yen firmed 0.68 percent versus the greenback at 105.55 per dollar. The Mexican peso lost 0.22 percent to 18.87, while the Canadian dollar fell 0.35 percent versus the greenback at 1.29. Canada will retaliate against any U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum products, officials said on Thursday. U.S. Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year yield bouncing back from a three-week low as the Bank of Japan’s chief hinted at a possible exit from its ultra-easy policies if inflation hits its target in its fiscal 2019. Benchmark 10-year notes fell 18/32 in price to push its yield up 2.8661 percent. Oil fell for a third day and traded further below $65 a barrel as rising U.S. inventories, record output and a stronger dollar outweighed high compliance with the supply-cutting deal of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. U.S. crude rose 24 cents to $61.23 per barrel and Brent gained 34 cents to $64.17 per barrel. Reporting by Herbert Lash, additional reporting by Richard

2018-03-02,"BRASILIA, March 2 (Reuters) - Brazilian aluminum producers are concerned that U.S. President Donald Trump is launching into a trade war with China that will ricochet on the world market and depress prices if Chinese exporters have to find other buyers. Brazil is not a big exporter of aluminum products to the United States, but a tariff war between the world’s largest importer and China, its biggest exporter, will inevitably bring volatility to a market where prices were recovering, said Milton Rego, president of the Brazilian Aluminum Association. “Brazil has to watch out. This is a fight between elephants in a small room and, at the first move, someone else is going to get thrown out of the window,” Rego said by telephone. Trump announced on Thursday he would impose hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to protect U.S. producers, risking retaliation from major trade partners like China and Europe. Rego expects the cost of aluminum will rise in the United States, where premiums over LME prices are already climbing, while world prices will drop when Chinese aluminum plate, sheet and foil look for alterative markets. That is bad news for Brazil’s shrinking aluminum industry, which has lost half its capacity in recent years due to plant closures caused by high electricity costs, Rego said. Brazil is the second-largest source of steel imports into the United States after Canada, accounting for 13 percent of volume in 2017, and its steel industry risks significant damage from U.S. tariffs. The Brazilian government expressed “enormous concern” about the proposed U.S. tariffs and said Brazil may take “multilateral or bilateral” action to protect its interests. Reporting by Anthony Boadle

2018-03-02,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) is not against upgrading the exhaust systems of older diesel cars to make them cleaner, but could not afford to pay for such a huge undertaking itself and is concerned it might impair vehicle performance, its CEO said.  After Germany’s top administrative court on Tuesday allowed local authorities to bar heavily polluting diesel cars in major cities, the federal government is scrambling to find ways to avert driving bans that would hurt consumers and automakers. Environmental and motorist lobbies are raising the pressure on Volkswagen (VW) and its peers to modify the exhaust systems of older diesels which they say are a major source of toxic nitrogen oxide emissions that can cause respiratory disease. “I don’t want to say now that I’m ruling it out,” VW Chief Executive Matthias Mueller said on Friday at an auto industry event. But he voiced misgivings. Hardware changes would cost between 1,500 ($1,845.30) and 7,000 euros per car, and the development as well as testing of new exhaust cleaning systems would take 2-3 years, Mueller said. Also, retrofitted vehicles might consume more fuel and emit more carbon dioxide, which would affect the level of car tax, he added. Of the 15 million diesel cars on Germany’s roads, only 2.7 million are equipped with the latest Euro-6 emissions technology. Research firm Evercore ISI has estimated that upgrading the exhaust cleaning of the 6 million Euro-5 vehicles could cost up to 14.5 billion euros ($17.9 billion). “I would compare hardware changes on a Euro-5 vehicle to an open-heart surgery,” Mueller said. There is no way that VW could shoulder major costs for such modifications as it is stretched by the costs and fines related to its “Dieselgate” emissions scandal, he said. “We had to pay about 25 billion in America, we cannot again pay 17 billion for hardware refits,” Mueller said. “That is simple not possible.” Reporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-emissions-ceo/diesel-vehicle-refits-costly-and-could-affect-performance-vw-says-idUKL8N1QK42W,02 Mar 2018,"Volkswagen is not

2018-03-02,"MOSCOW/KIEV (Reuters) - Russia’s Gazprom (GAZP.MM) said on Friday it would terminate its gas contracts with Ukraine after it lost a court case, escalating a dispute which has left Ukraine struggling to stay warm and which the EU said could threaten gas flows to Europe. A Stockholm arbitration court ordered Gazprom this week to pay more than $2.5 billion to Ukrainian energy firm Naftogaz - a ruling meant to conclude a long legal battle that has run alongside Ukraine’s broader political stand-off with Russia. But after the court decision, Gazprom did not restart gas supplies to Ukraine as expected on Thursday, forcing Kiev to take emergency measures to make up for the shortfall and warn that transit flows to Europe were at risk. To make up for the lack of supplies from Russia, Kiev has suspended lessons at schools, universities and kindergartens until next week, switched power stations from gas to fuel oil and bought extra gas from Poland. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said Gazprom had no right to suspend its contracts, and he expected them to remain in force. The moves showed that the Russian gas giant was not a reliable supplier, he said. The threat of a supply cut to Europe comes as the continent has been hit by a record-setting cold spell, driving up demand. In a statement, Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said the court’s ruling meant the company’s gas deals with Ukraine would no longer be commercially viable, so it had no choice but to ask the court to terminate them. “Gazprom had to immediately start the procedure of the termination of the contracts with Naftogaz on gas supplies and transit at the Stockholm arbitration court,” Miller said. Naftogaz declined immediate comment on the decision. On Twitter, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin said: “Yesterday I called Gazprom con artists, but today they are behaving like poker players and trying to raise the stakes. Only it’s not clear what they’re playing or with whom.”  The row represents a new chapter in a long-running disagreement that prompted Russia to suspend gas exports to Europe, notably in the winters of 2005-2006 and 2008-2009. European Union Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said Brussels was concerned not only about the supply of gas to Ukraine, but also about the transit of gas to the bloc. “The Commission stands ready to steer a trilateral process which in the past has already proven to be effective in situations of disagreement,” Sefcovic said in a statement. Ukraine is the main route for the Russian gas to Europe where Gazprom accounts for around 35 percent of the market. Ukraine and Russia have had a complex dispute over gas prices for years, which blew up when the two countries became enemies after a pro-Russian leader of Ukraine was toppled in 2014. Moscow responded that year by seizing Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula and backing pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, where fighting has killed 10,000 people. In one of its rulings, the Stockholm court ordered Naftogaz to buy 5 billion cubic meters of gas from Gazprom a year from 2018. The March deliveries would have been the first time Ukraine bought gas directly from Russia since November 2015, when it started buying gas from Europe via so-called “reverse flows”, to try to cut its energy dependency on Moscow.    Last year, Gazprom supplied a record high 194 billion cubic meters of gas to Europe, excluding former Soviet states and Turkey. Transit of Russian gas jumped by almost 14 percent to 93.5 bcm via Ukraine.  A Gazprom spokesman did not respond to a request to comment on possible risks to the Russian gas exports to Europe.

2018-03-02,"WASHINGTON, March 2 (Reuters) - A small Canadian mining company has staked claim to mineral rights on over a hundred thousand acres of federal land in Utah since last year, hoping to tap lithium deposits from spent oil wells to feed America’s high-tech battery industry. The play by Vancouver-based MGX Minerals is part of a global scramble for the super-light metal used in smart phones, electric vehicles, and storage for power generated by wind and solar installations. MGX Minerals shares have surged 40 percent this year to C$1.43  ($1.11). Still, analysts were divided over prospects of the move. The company said it was encouraged by President Donald Trump’s administration’s move this year to encourage more U.S. production of lithium and other metals on a list of “critical minerals” it says are important for national security. U.S. officials “understand that the U.S. needs a supply of lithium and is cognizant of global competition,” said MGX CEO Jared Lazerson in an interview. He called Utah “one of the best places to start for lithium for North America.” The United States currently has only one active lithium operation, owned by Albemarle Corp in Nevada, and imports more than half the lithium it consumes. Other companies, including Westwater Resources, US Lithium Corp and Pure Energy, are also trying to develop new lithium projects in the United States to feed rising demand. MGX is focusing its mineral rights claims on southeastern Utah’s Paradox Basin, a productive oil and gas drilling area. The company plans to extract lithium from drilling wastewater, using a proprietary filtration system it has piloted in western Canada’s oil patch. Much of the world’s lithium is filtered from underground brines, though relatively little is extracted from petroleum wastewater, the volumes of which have been increasing in the United States due to a production boom. “In this fundamental shift we are in between fossil fuels and renewable energy, we get these hybrid models,” Lazerson said, referring to his company’s technology. Analysts have given the venture mixed reviews. “Think about drilling a hole 2,000 meters long, through rock, to hit brine in Utah, and coming up with negligible lithium,” said Jon Hykawy, a battery minerals analyst at Stormcrow Capital. “Wildcatting for water is probably not a great business model.” Stephan Bogner, an analyst for Rockstone Research, was more optimistic: “If MGX can prove commercial viability… a big rethinking may begin in the United States as to where capital should be deployed,” he said. “It would be a game-changer.” Despite burgeoning demand for lithium from battery producers around the world, some analysts believe the market for the metal is headed for a glut. On Monday, Morgan Stanley sent lithium stocks tumbling when it forecast a surplus in 2022 that would drive prices down to half their current level. Some industry officials took issue with the outlook. Lazerson said he has been told by companies to get them “anything that has any lithium in it.” He did not disclose details. Lazerson said wastewater brines available in southeastern Utah are relatively rich in lithium for North America, with content as high as 730 parts per million. The company hired Utah land acquisition company Plateau Ventures to stake out claims in the area and it hopes to start commercial production of lithium from the holdings within 18 months. “You have Tesla and GM bringing electric vehicles on line with no significant new source of lithium. Everyone is struggling for feedstock right now,” he said. He said he could not disclose the companies with which MCX is in supply talks. An official for electric car maker Tesla Inc did not immediately respond to a request for comment. GM  spokesman Tony Cervone said the company would not publicly comment on specific sourcing of commodities. The U.S. Geological Survey said in a report last month that global lithium consumption rose more than 13 percent in 2017 to 41,500 tons - driven by surging electric vehicle production in China and elsewhere - with prices rising worldwide. In the United States, prices rose more than 60 percent to $13,900 a metric ton. “Lithium supply security has become a top priority for technology companies in the United States and Asia,” the report noted. Chile and Australia are currently the world’s top lithium producers, accounting for more than half of global output. MGX’s most advanced projects are in Alberta, where it holds over a million acres of mineral rights. In January 2017, the company concentrated lithium from heavy oil waste water in the province using its rapid filtration process, with results confirmed by the Saskatchewan Research Council. Lazerson said the company’s pilot plant in Calgary is on track to reach commercial scale early this year.

2018-03-02,"SOFIA, March 2 (Reuters) - The Energy Ministry should draw up proposals by the end of June on whether to proceed with or scrap plans for Bulgaria’s Belene nuclear power project, parliament decided on Friday. The Black Sea state initially cancelled the project in 2012 after failing to find foreign investors and bowing to U.S. and European Union pressure to limit the country’s energy dependence on Russia, which would have supplied some equipment. But the current government renewed the search for private investors to build the plant on the Danube River after an arbitration court ruled in 2016 that Bulgaria had to pay more than 600 million euros ($739 million) in compensation to Russian state nuclear company Rosatom due to the cancellation. The plant would be Bulgaria’s second nuclear power station after the Kozloduy power plant, also on the Danube River. The chairman of parliament’s energy commission, Delyan Dobrev, said Friday’s demand by lawmakers for the Energy Ministry to make a decision about the project’s fate “does not exclude any option for the government.” Bulgaria has spent more than 3 billion levs ($1.89 billion)on the project so far, Dobrev said, adding that lawmakers wanted clarity on what would now happen to those assets. “Today we do not make a decision to build or not to build the Belene nuclear power plant, we do not make a decision to have additional nuclear power or not,” he said. Lawmakers from the ruling centre-right GERB party said any potential investors in future should be willing to build the plant without state guarantees and without long-term power purchase agreements. Bulgaria’s Socialists, the largest opposition party, and Attack, part of the United Patriots grouping that is a junior partner in the ruling coalition, are among those calling for the project to be restarted. But several economists say Bulgaria does not need Belene, saying the cost of building it outweighs the benefits. They say such a large project offered potential for corruption, a problem they say is widespread in the Balkan nation. Prosecutors have charged three former energy ministers over mismanagement linked to the project. ($1 = 0.8119 euros) $1 = 1.5900 leva

2018-03-02,"MOSCOW, March 2 (Reuters) - Taneko refinery, controlled by Russian mid-sized oil producer Tatneft, will export diesel through the Sever pipeline  this year for the first time, sending 300,000 tonnes on the route to the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk. Taneko now exports diesel by train, and gaining access to the pipeline could boost its shipments of oil products for export. It is expected to produce 1 million tonnes of gasoline this year and aims to double diesel output to 3 million tonnes this year. The source, familiar with the companies’ plans, also said TAIF, another refinery which like Taneko is located in Russia’s Tatarstan region, will supply about 1.5 million tonnes of diesel to the Sever pipeline, a similar volume to this year. Both Tatneft and TAIF did not immediately comment on the plans. Russia plans to increase diesel exports from Primorsk to 19.8 million tonnes in 2019 and 23.9 million tonnes in 2020 from an expected 18.3 million tonnes in 2018. Tatneft plans to invest about 200 billion roubles ($3.5 billion) in upgrading Taneko in 2017-2025 and is considering plans to build a third production line at the refinery. $1 = 57.0525 roubles

2018-03-02,"OSLO (Reuters) - British gas prices spiked again in volatile trading on Friday as an ongoing cold snap raised concerns about supplies. “Today was absolute panic,” one trader said, adding that it was “still a highly unusual situation” as prices for within-day gas delivery reached 350 pence per therm at one point, matching Thursday’s more than 10-year record. Southern Britain could see average temperatures of 0 degrees Celsius, but they are forecast to rise to 5 degrees on Saturday and as high as 9 degrees on Monday, Britain’s Met Office said. Although Britain’s gas system opened largely balanced with a shortfall of just 4.4 million cubic metres (mcm) per day, National Grid data showed, the shortfall later widened to 12.4 mcm, triggering fresh concerns over supply. The within-day gas delivery contract had initially opened 30 percent lower, after National Grid withdrew a gas supply warning it had issued on Thursday, saying that new supplies were reaching the market, and some outages which had supported prices were resolved. An outage at the Entry SEGAL pipeline system was cutting imports by 18 mcm per day, although an outage at Norway’s Kollsnes gas plant had been resolved, restoring full exports via the Langeled pipeline between Norway and Britain. “We see Langeled back up but much lower LNG sendout, I think they are running empty,” said the trader.  Speculation about supply also contributed in Friday’s price volatility, another trader said. “You can just buy it all day long and hold and take the profits later in the day,” the second trader said. Despite the supply shortfall, no liquefied natural gas vessels were scheduled to arrive in Britain on Friday, port authority and Thomson Reuters data showed. The first one, the Maran Gas Ulysses, is scheduled for March 6.

2018-03-02,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump urged representatives from the rival oil and corn industries on Thursday to break a deadlock in talks over the future of the nation’s biofuels policy by accepting a deal involving reforms sought by both sides. Trump has arranged a series of talks between Big Corn and Big Oil since late last year amid rising concern in the White House over the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a law requiring refiners to mix biofuels such as corn-based ethanol into their fuel. The decade-old policy was intended to help farmers and reduce petroleum imports but has increasingly divided farmers and energy companies - two of Trump’s most important constituencies. Refining company Philadelphia Energy Solutions LLC in the key electoral state of Pennsylvania in January blamed the RFS for its bankruptcy. A source who attended Thursday’s meeting at the White House said Trump told the gathering of lawmakers and corporate executives that he supports a proposal from the refining industry to cap the price of biofuels blending credits that refiners must acquire to comply with the RFS. Prices for the blending credits - which refiners must either earn or purchase - have surged in recent years, upsetting companies that in some cases are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on them.  The source, who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak publicly on the discussion, said Trump also expressed support for expanding sales of high-ethanol gasoline – a tweak long-sought by ethanol producers.     The Environmental Protection Agency bans the use of gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol during the summer months, a move intended to reduce ozone emissions and smog during the peak driving season.  The two ideas, combined, represented a “win-win” solution for the oil and corn industries that could help them break their deadlock, Trump told the meeting, according to the source.    Biofuel interests in the meeting tried to persuade Trump to approve the so-called E15 waiver and see if that drives down credit prices, but Trump rejected the request saying the industry needed immediate changes. Trump told the parties that he wanted credit caps and greater use of higher-ethanol blended gasoline and to come back in a week, the source said. He then abruptly ended the meeting, stood and began to exit the room, the source said.  Republican Senator Joni Ernst, of Iowa, asked for more time to study the impact of the price cap, the source said. “Take the deal, Joni,” Trump said as he walked out of the room, according to the source.  Ernst disagreed with the source’s description. “It’s not accurate. That exchange didn’t take place,” an Ernst spokeswoman said via email on Friday morning. The White House said after the meeting that talks on the issue would continue: “Today’s meeting is a part of the ongoing effort to best understand the many differing views on this issue, and the president looks forward to continuing this discussion,” it said in a statement. Republican Senator Charles Grassley of corn state Iowa, who attended the meeting, said the talks did not yield any final decisions, but that an “emerging solution” could include allowing year-round sales of 15 percent ethanol fuel. He added that he opposes a credit price cap, saying such a move could put “thousands of jobs in rural America” at risk. No specific price cap level was discussed at Thursday’s meeting, according to the source, but Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who has been driving efforts to tweak the RFS on behalf of refiners and who attended the meeting, has proposed limiting credit prices to 10 cents each - a fraction of their current value. Prices for the credits, called RINs, dropped 10 cents to 53 cents each after the meeting, according to traders.  Cruz said in a statement with Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania that he was “encouraged that President Trump recognises the importance of providing relief from crushing RINs costs and expanding the potential market for ethanol.” The biofuels industry had mixed reaction to the meeting, generally supporting the idea of year-round sales of high-ethanol blend gasoline but worried by the proposed price cap for credits, which some in the industry worry would curtail investment in new blending facilities. “The president very clearly understands that the path forward is to allow sales of E15 year-round, promote growth, and put more RINs on the market,” said Emily Skor, chief executive officer of biofuels producer Growth Energy. “Nothing new was discussed in this meeting. Removing accountability from oil companies would deprive millions of Americans the freedom to choose less expensive, homegrown biofuels and imperil countless jobs and family farms across America’s heartland,” said Jeff Broin, CEO of leading U.S. ethanol producer POET. Ethanol producer Green Plains Inc (GPRE.O) also attended, sources said. Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N), Delta Air Lines’ (DAL.N) Monroe Energy, PBF Energy Inc (PBF.N), and Philadelphia Energy Solutions were also at the session, sources said.

2018-03-02,"* Trump’s tariff on steel and aluminium raises trade war fears * U.S. debt yields fall as trade worries dwarf inflation jitters * Yen jumps after Kuroda says mulls exit if inflation target met * European shares fall over 1.5 pct, Wall Street futures lower * Italian elections, German coalition vote on Sunday * Trump tweets “trade wars are good, and easy to win” By Marc Jones LONDON, March 2 (Reuters) - The spectre of a global trade war sent world stocks tumbling towards a 2.5 percent weekly loss on Friday, and left bruised investors reaching for the traditional antidotes - government bonds, gold and the Japanese yen. The falls came after U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States would impose tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminium, sparking concerns of retaliatory moves from major trade partners China, Europe and neighbouring Canada. Europe’s STOXX 600 index fell over 1.5 percent led by a near 5 percent slump from world’s biggest steelmaker ArcelorMittal SA and 2.5 - 6 percent drops from the region’s carmakers worried that they might be next. Wall Street futures were also pointing lower for what would be a fourth straight day and another difficult week for the benchmark S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial and Nasdaq indexes. “Trade wars are good, and easy to win,” Trump’s first Friday tweet said, which only acted to inflame the markets’ nerves. The dollar and U.S. Treasury yields both fell as they appeared to push aside considerations of inflation, a major theme that spooked financial markets over the last month. Ten-year U.S. Treasuries yields dipped to 2.8024 percent, hitting its lowest level in three weeks and further extending the distance from its four-year peak of 2.957 percent touched on Feb 21. The dollar fell across the board including to more than one year low against the yen at 105.54. “It is a real worry because Europe is a open global economy so it isn’t just about U.S. versus China,” said Ian Ormiston, a European equity fund manager at Old Mutual Global Investors about Trump’s moves. “And we will see retaliation there are no two ways about it.” Europe’s market moves compounded what was already a fragile mood ahead of a crunch few days of politics. Britain’s under-fire Prime Minister Theresa May will flesh out her Brexit plans later, while Germany will find out if it finally has a coalition government on Sunday with Italy also holding delicately-poised elections that day. Combined with the simmering trade war nerves it was unsurprising then that safe-haven demand was on the rise. German Bunds - Europe’s credit market benchmark - saw their yields fall to a five-week low of 0.618 percent as Italy’s BTP yields dropped to a two-week low of 2.008 percent. “I am surprised how little risk the market is pricing from this,” said the Chief Investment Officer of Pictet Wealth Management Cesar Perez Ruiz, referring to the Italian elections. The trade nerves had dominated Asian market moves. Japan’s Nikkei tumbled 2.5 percent to end the week down 3.3, while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares excluding Japan dropped 0.9 percent to take its losses for the week to 2.1 percent. Steelmakers were hit the hardest there too with South Korea’s Posco down 3.3 percent and Japan’s Nippon Steel off 3.8 percent. Toyota Motor shares skidded 2.4 percent too after the automaker had said the planned tariffs would substantially raise the production costs and therefore prices of cars and trucks sold in America. On Thursday on Wall Street, the S&P 500 had lost 36.16 points, or 1.33 percent, to 2,677.67, coming a day after a another heavy sell on worries the Federal Reserve might increase it interest rates more than expected this year. The anxiety over tit-for-tat trade tariff moves was underscored by Canada’s quick response, with officials in Ottawa saying they will retaliate. China and the EU both followed, saying that they will safeguard their interests. “The measures that we are prepared to take will prove that we will, on the basis of the rules, not hesitate to protect our industry,” a European Commission spokesman said. The concerns also eclipsed upbeat U.S. economic data including a 14-year high in manufacturing figures and a 48-year low in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits. In the currency market, the dollar’s retreat saw the euro jump back to $1.2273, after having hit a seven-week low of $1.21545 on Thursday. The yen had got an additional boost when Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he would mull an exit from the BOJ’s current stimulus regime if the central bank’s 2 percent inflation target is achieved in 2019. The dollar index is down 2.1 percent this year, dogged by suspicions that the Trump administration prefers a weaker dollar to help narrow the United States’ yawning trade deficit. Worries that Trump’s big tax cuts and spending plans will ramp up fiscal deficits to the extent that they undermine confidence in U.S. debt have also hurt the greenback though it had been on the rise again in recent weeks. Oil prices were also under pressure, having fallen more than 1 percent the previous day on trade friction fears. U.S. crude was little changed in European trade at $60.88 per barrel, having fallen to two-week low of $60.18 on Thursday. It is down 3.7 percent so far this week. Brent futures traded at $63.74 per barrel having hit a two-week low of $63.19. “The world stands on the brink of a trade war,” said Robert Carnell, head of research, Asia-Pacific at ING in Singapore. “Forget the yield curve - this is how recessions start.” Addtional reporting by Hideyuki Sano; Editing by Angus

2018-03-02,"LONDON/TUNIS (Reuters) - French energy company Total (TOTF.PA) substantially raised its presence in Libya with the purchase of a 16.33 percent stake in Libya’s Waha concessions from U.S. Marathon Oil (MRO.N) for $450 million on Friday. The deal will give Total access to reserves and resources in excess of 500 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe), with immediate production of around 50,000 boe/d (per day) and “significant exploration potential” in concessions in the Sirte Basin, the company said in a statement.  “This acquisition is in line with Total’s strategy to reinforce its portfolio with high quality and low-technical cost assets whilst bolstering our historic strength in the Middle East and North Africa region,” said Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne.  Total has been in Libya for decades and holds a production share of 31,500 boe/d in 2017 from concessions in the offshore Al Jurf field and the onshore Sharara field. It also has a share in Mabruk field, which has been closed for several years because of poor security. The Waha Oil Company, a subsidiary of Libya’s state-owned National Oil Corp (NOC), currently produces 300,000 boe/d, which is expected to rise to 400,000 boe/d by the end of the decade, Total said. Other Waha stakeholders are NOC with 59.18 percent, ConocoPhillips (COP.N) with 16.33 percent and Hess (HES.N) with 8.16 percent. The oil industry in OPEC member Libya has staged a partial recovery after being hit by blockades and armed conflict following an uprising seven years ago.  National production dropped to lows of about 200,000 barrels per day (bpd), before rebounding to 1 million bpd last summer. It is still well under the 1.6 million bpd Libya was producing before 2011, and the industry has suffered continuing stoppages including the current closure of the southwestern El Feel field due to a protest by guards.  Waha is one of Libya’s main export grades. It is shipped from the eastern port of Es Sider, which was blockaded by an armed faction between 2014 and 2016. Es Sider and other ports in Libya’s Oil Crescent are now controlled by the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA), which allowed the NOC to reopen them in late 2016. Waha’s chairman said in November that the company was aiming to increase output to 375,000 bpd by the end of 2018, but faced major funding shortfalls and challenges in maintaining damaged infrastructure.   “Production and reserves growth is a key deal driver,” Woodmac VP for Corporate Analysis Luke Parker said. “There’s certainly upside from where we are today ... Realising this upside would see Total create significant value through the deal.” Marathon's sale marks a full exit from Libya, a move it has been considering since at least mid-2013 but has been prevented from doing so by the NOC. [here] “Our relentless focus on portfolio management has driven seven country exits since 2013 and generated proceeds of over $4 billion just in the last two years,” said Lee Tillman, Marathon president and CEO. In a regulatory filing in 2011, Marathon valued the Waha asset at $761 million. At the time, oil prices LCOc1 were roughly double where they stand today. Brent was trading above $63 a barrel on Friday. [here]  “They received what we consider a pretty good price for the asset given that it was considered non-core,” said Jason Gammel, equity analyst at U.S. investment bank Jefferies. He said Total were “probably better able to manage the geopolitical risk of a wide-base of operations across the Middle East.”  The Marathon sale marks the second exit for a U.S. company from Libya in recent years.  Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) sold a 7 percent stake in the Nafoura oilfield to Austria’s OMV (OMVV.VI) in late 2016.

2018-03-02,"LUANDA (Reuters) - Angola has offered investors diamond exploration licenses that previously belonged to Isabel dos Santos, daughter of the former president, according to a video clip of a closed-door meeting with mining companies seen by Reuters.   During the meeting at a mining conference in Cape Town last month, president of state diamond company Endiama, José Manuel Ganga Júnior, said the licenses had expired and were now available for new exploration partners. Isabel dos Santos is Africa’s richest woman with assets across multiple sectors in Angola and Portugal from jewelry to supermarkets. Her family has been a powerful force in Angola for four decades but her star has faded since her father, President José Eduardo dos Santos, stepped down last year.  His successor President João Lourenço promised to tackle family monopolies and make Angola more attractive to investors.  He dismissed her as chair of state oil company Sonangol, Angola’s most important firm, in November.        The licenses for primary deposits mentioned in slides accompanying the presentation, a copy of which Reuters has also seen, were for Camafuca-Camazambo, Mulepe, Sangamina, Chiri, and Tchiegi. All are located in the north-eastern diamond producing provinces of Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul. A source in the Angolan diamond industry told Reuters the Camafuca-Camazambo and Chiri licenses had previously been in the hands of Isabel dos Santos. Representatives for Isabel dos Santos did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  “It is true that these kimberlites (a geological formation of igneous rock in which diamonds are sometimes found) we presented to promote and offer for exploration were already granted as licenses in the past, many years ago,” Ganga Junior said in the video. A spokesman at Endiama confirmed the video was authentic and that the licenses were offered to investors. The Ministry of Natural Resources directed questions to the state company.  “These licenses have expired ... At this time, we don’t have any commitment with any former owners of these projects,” Ganga Junior said.   Angola is one of the world’s top 5 diamond producers, but much of the territory remains under-explored due to 27 years of civil war and a closed, difficult business environment since fighting ended in 2002.  Lourenço took power in September and says he wants to shed Angola’s image as an opaque oil economy with rampant corruption. He wants to attract international investors and has made changes to wrest power from dos Santos, pushing out some of his key allies.  Russia’s Alrosa is the only major diamond company currently producing in Angola via its stake in the Catoca mine - one of the world’s largest.  “We are ready to start from zero to negotiate in the best conditions, the best possibilities for the good of Endiama, our country and potential shareholders,” Ganga Junior said. “Apart from Endiama which has to be a partner by law, the rest is open.”   Editing by Ed Stoddard and Anna Willard",https://uk.reuters.com/article/angola-diamonds/exclusive-angola-offers-former-dos-santos-diamond-rights-to-investors-idUKL8N1QK1LR,02 Mar 2018,"Angola has offered investors

2018-03-02,"MANILA, March 2 (Reuters) - The Philippines on Friday identified two areas in South China Sea where joint exploration for oil and gas may be undertaken with China, including one in territory that both sides have argued over for years. The two countries have agreed to set up a special panel to work out how they can jointly explore in part of the hotly contested waters without having to address the issue of sovereignty, something experts say would be extremely complex. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s spokesman, Harry Roque, said the areas being considered were sites covered by service contracts 57 and 72, which are exploration permits issued by Manila’s energy ministry. “What I know is that there are two areas being considered for joint exploration, but both are within the exclusive economic zone” of the Philippines, Roque told reporters. China claims almost the entire South China Sea, believed to rich in energy reserves and marine resources. Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan also have claims. The 880,000-hectare SC-72 at the Reed Bank, a disputed area, is where PXP Energy Corp had been undertaking exploration to evaluate the block’s gas reserves. In 2016, the Philippines won a case at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, which invalidated China’s claim to sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, and also made clear the Reed Bank was inside the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). China does not recognise the ruling. Since Reed Bank is disputed, Roque said “there must be an agreement before the two countries can proceed with the joint exploration”. The Philippine energy ministry suspended exploration in the Reed Bank, known locally as Recto Bank, in late 2014 as the government pursued the arbitration case, disrupting PXP Energy’s plan to drill two wells. Chinese boats had in 2011 harassed a survey ship contracted by PXP’s unit, Forum Energy. PXP is eager to resume exploration in the Reed Bank but said any joint venture would likely involve a Chinese company. PXP had been talking with China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) about Reed Bank during the administration of Duterte’s predecessor, Benigno Aquino, but the arbitration disrupted negotiations. In September last year, the Philippines said it was pursuing a long-delayed oil and gas exploration project with CNOOC and a Canada-listed company in the SC-57 area, which is outside disputed waters. The area lies near the country’s main oil and gas fields, including Malampaya, Nido, Cadlao and Matinloc.

2018-03-02,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Japan’s Honda Motor Co (7267.T) has halted new sales of CR-V crossovers in China and may have to do the same with its Civic model after a Chinese watchdog rejected the automaker’s plan to recall 350,000 of the cars to fix a problem. The company had planned to address a cold-climate engine problem on two of its top-selling models in two phases, recalling CR-V sport utility vehicles from late February and Civics from early March. A Honda spokesman said on Friday China’s quality control watchdog considered its plan insufficient, leading Honda to stop sales of new CR-Vs until a new recall plan had been agreed.  The company’s problems in the world’s biggest auto market highlight what appears to be an emerging trend, where Chinese customers air their complaints on Weibo - the country’s Twitter equivalent - and other social media, forcing carmakers to act. With complaints from CR-V and Civic owners pouring out in mid-January, Honda devised a recall plan in only about a month. Honda had said on Feb. 12 it intended to recall roughly 350,000 CR-Vs and Civics equipped with a 1.5-litre turbo engine. Both affected models have been sold by Honda’s joint venture with China’s Dongfeng Motor Group Co Ltd (0489.HK).  The Honda spokesman said company officials earlier this week went to China’s General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine to explain its plan. On Thursday, the agency said in a statement on its official website that Honda’s proposals were “not enough.”  “The company needs to improve the recall plans further,” it said, suggesting Honda could extend the warranty coverage period of the affected cars.  The Honda spokesman said its officials were expected to go back to the agency with a revised plan soon. He did not elaborate. The recalls are aimed at fixing a problem caused by an unusual amount of un-combusted petrol collecting in the engine’s lubricant oil pan. The issue in some cases caused a strong odor of gasoline inside the car and in others the car’s check-engine light came on. Honda and Dongfeng plan to resolve the issue by updating the engine’s gasoline injection control software. Honda officials said there had been no reports of accidents.

SCMP cited two unidentified sources with direct knowledge of the matter saying Shanghai Guosheng Group, a portfolio and investment agency controlled by Shanghai’s municipal government, had taken over management and daily operations. SCMP did not give a reason for the move. Reuters and other Chinese and international media reported this week that CEFC Chairman Ye Jianming had been investigated for suspected economic crimes. CEFC denied this and Friday’s report, saying operations were running as normal. If confirmed, CEFC would be the second company in the past week to be seized by China’s government, which wants to curtail big-spending conglomerates in a crackdown on financial risk. The Chinese government took control of Anbang Insurance Group Co Ltd [ANBANG.UL] on Friday and said its chairman had been prosecuted for economic crimes. A CEFC spokesman said on Friday the firm had not been informed of any takeover and CEFC China Energy management was still in charge. On Thursday, CEFC denied reports about Ye’s investigation, saying they “had no basis in fact” and the company was “operating normally.” Shanghai Guosheng did not answer calls seeking comment. Reports of the probe put pressure on shares in CEFC Anhui International Holding 002018.SZ, a Shanghai-listed subsidiary of CEFC, sending them 3.9 percent lower on Friday after a 10 percent fall the previous session, the maximum allowed in a day. A major Chinese ratings agency downgraded another CEFC unit, CEFC Shanghai International Group, and trading in that unit’s bonds were halted. Other Chinese conglomerates with major overseas assets have also come under government scrutiny in recent months, buffeted by shifting policy winds. These include HNA Group, the parent of Hainan Airlines, Dalian Wanda, Fosun and others that had once been encouraged by the government to invest abroad. Shanghai Guosheng, set up in 2007, is an investment arm of the Shanghai government that has invested in state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC) and has stakes in state firms such as Bright Food and Guotai Junan Securities.  According to its website, the agency aims to “promote the integration and reorganization of various resources, capital and assets” and “actively participate in the reorganization and adjustment” of state-owned assets and enterprises.

2018-03-02,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Rod Nickel and Nia Williams CALGARY, Alberta, March 2 (Reuters) - Canada’s First Nations are boosting investments and leveraging their clout with regulators to gain stakes in oil and gas projects as they seek greater returns on energy produced or transported across their territory. Aboriginal groups in Canada have traditionally played a more passive role in the energy industry, collecting royalties from oil and gas output. That model is changing as some indigenous groups buy oil wells and negotiate ownership stakes in proposed pipelines and storage projects. “It’s assets that create cash flow,” said Joe Dion, Chief Executive of First Nations-owned Frog Lake Energy Resources Corp, which produces 2,000 barrels of oil per day. “We get a piece of the action.” First Nations, also called bands, play a pivotal role in Canada’s oil industry because governments and companies have a legal duty to consult and accommodate them before proceeding with resource projects affecting their territories. The law gives bands “pretty close to an effective veto,” said University of Saskatchewan professor Ken Coates. Some aboriginal groups have used that leverage to stop or delay oil projects, as when Enbridge Inc’s proposed Northern Gateway pipeline was rejected by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in 2016 after bands raised environmental concerns. Other indigenous groups, however, are increasingly using the same power to negotiate ownership stakes in projects. A bigger financial role for First Nations in the sector could help unlock oil and gas reserves in Canada, the world’s fifth largest producer, that might otherwise stay in the ground because of objections from environmental or aboriginal rights groups. Their experience parallels that of Native American tribes, who are also deeply split on whether and how to develop the vast resources on tribal lands. Indigenous Canadians make up about 5 percent of the nation’s population and face higher levels of poverty and violence, giving bands a powerful incentive to maximize energy revenues to raise living standards. “It’s so polarized,” said Stephen Buffalo, chief executive of the advocacy group Indian Resource Council. “Some want to see the benefit, others think it’s going to kill the earth.” Frog Lake, a firm owned by Alberta’s Frog Lake First Nation, is looking to buy more oil-producing properties outside of its territory along with stakes in tank farms and pipelines, said Dion, who is a member of the neighboring Kehewin Cree Nation. Dion said aboriginal groups have traditionally settled for “the smaller stuff” - royalties from outside energy firms. “The revenue-sharing piece is here now,” Dion said. “That is where we have to go.” Aboriginal groups have a legal say in projects on their lands, which are held in trust by the Canadian government for band members, and also those that might impact them indirectly. First Nations’ support gives energy firms better odds of overcoming any concerns from other aboriginal groups. Ottawa on Feb. 8 unveiled draft legislation for resource projects that places greater emphasis on considering their impact on aboriginal communities. Under the rules for assessing major projects, to take effect next year, such concerns will be heard by the new Canadian Energy Regulator and Impact Assessment Agency of Canada. Examples of First Nations taking bigger roles in energy projects are mounting. RBC Capital Markets’ North American head of project finance Mark Saar said the bank is seeing more pipeline and storage companies seeking financial partnerships with aboriginals. RBC in December completed a C$545 million bond issue for the Fort McKay and Mikisew Cree bands - the largest ever private investment by a First Nation - allowing them to buy a 49 percent stake in a Suncor Energy storage facility. “The deal was oversubscribed,” Saar said. “We think there would be appetite for further similar deals.” Some investors find aboriginals’ involvement in energy projects appealing given that their support is often critical for regulatory approvals, Saar said. Others, however, worry about being tied to First Nations’ finances because of historic mismanagement by some bands. Investors and lenders are displaying “greater acceptance of First Nations as players,” said David Sharpe, a Mohawk aboriginal and Chief Executive of Toronto-based debt firm Bridging Finance, referring to RBC’s bond issue. Bridging Finance last year financed an unnamed First Nation’s C$11 million purchase of stakes in producing oil wells and is working on four more similar deals, Sharpe said. Investment bank AltaCorp Capital is raising funds for a C$16 billion ($12.85 billion) oil pipeline, proposed to run from Alberta to the northern British Columbia coast. The project has modest financial backing from one of Canada’s richest families, the Aquilini Group, and support from 35 First Nations to use their land. In exchange for allowing that access, the bands will own at least 35 percent of the pipeline and a corresponding share of the profits. If built, Eagle Spirit would be a crucial second outlet to the Pacific Ocean for crude from the oil sands, which currently sells at a steep discount because of transportation constraints. Eagle Spirit Energy Holdings’ proposed oil pipeline has strong interest from energy companies and investors, said Eagle Spirit president and chairman Calvin Helin, who is aboriginal. The firm’s main roadblock is a proposed government moratorium against oil tankers along the ecologically sensitive northern B.C. coast. Two other private investor groups, A2A and G7G - with the political support of some First Nations - are proposing to build railways running from Alberta’s oil sands to Alaska, avoiding the coastline of British Columbia because of the pipeline opposition there. Matt Vickers, head of G7G, declined to detail the investors’ financial arrangements with the bands. New railways could provide an alternative to Kinder Morgan Canada’s  Trans Mountain pipeline expansion from Alberta to British Columbia, which has been delayed by one year due to the environmental concerns of the B.C. government, some aboriginals and municipalities. When Chief Isaac Laboucan-Avirom became leader of Alberta’s Woodland Cree Nation in 2013, he was struck by the contrast between his band’s precarious finances and the hydrocarbon wealth surrounding its territory. Three years later, Laboucan-Avirom signed an agreement allowing Baytex Energy Corp to drill in exchange for modest royalties and jobs. Now, the Woodland Cree are granting permission for Eagle Spirit pipeline to use its land - in exchange for an undisclosed ownership stake. Such opportunities have won over some groups trying to balance economic prosperity with environmental protection. “There’s been a real awakening,” said Laboucan-Avirom, who is looking for further investment in oil and gas assets. “Everything in our world is touched by oil and gas, whether we like it or not.” ($1 = 1.2453 Canadian dollars) (Additional reporting by Valerie Volcovici in Washington; Editing by Simon Webb and Brian Thevenot)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/canada-oil-aboriginal/rpt-canadas-first-nations-seek-bigger-stakes-profits-from-oil-sector-idUKL2N1QK023,02 Mar 2018,"Canada's First Nations

2018-03-02,"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine has switched power plants to fuel oil from gas in an effort to make up for an emergency shortage after Russian company Gazprom (GAZP.MM) declined to resume gas supplies to the country, Energy Minister Ihor Nasalyk said on Friday. The shortfall comes at a time of peak demand after a Europe-wide cold snap blanketed most of Ukraine with heavy snow and pushed temperatures well below freezing.  Nasalyk told parliament the lack of Russian supplies had created a deficit of up to 20 million cubic meters (mcm) of gas per day. Thermal power plants switching to fuel oil could save around 15 million mcm a day, he said. The Energy Ministry also asked local authorities to suspend lessons at schools, universities and kindergartens until March 6. The gas shortage equates to one tenth of Ukraine’s daily consumption of around 200 mcm. On Thursday, Gazprom said it had returned a prepayment to Ukraine and would not restart gas supplies as an additional agreement to the existing arrangements had not yet been reached. Ukraine said it would seek compensation. The row represents a new front in a long-running legal battle, a by-product of broader political tension following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. It follows Wednesday’s international arbitration court order for Gazprom to pay $2.56 billion to Ukraine’s Naftogaz after weighing mutual claims and counter-claims related to gas supplies and transit. The decision was welcomed in Ukraine as a major win for Naftogaz. Gazprom has said it will contest the ruling.

2018-03-02,"LONDON/HOUSTON (Reuters) - The gasps in the audience were clearly audible at the auction of Mexico’s oil blocks a month ago as Royal Dutch Shell’s hefty bids were announced one by one. The size of Shell’s cash payments - $343 million out of the total of $525 million that Mexico earned in the sale - far outstripped its competitors’ offers, guaranteeing that the company swept up nine of the 19 offshore blocks. The Anglo-Dutch major knew something no one else did. Six months earlier, its drilling rig had struck a giant oil reservoir, the Whale well, in the U.S. side of the Gulf of Mexico - just across the border from many of the Mexican blocks, which share a similar Paleogene-age geology. Calculating that this significantly increased the chances of the Mexican blocks also containing treasure, Shell delayed the announcement of the discovery until the day of the auction, after bids had been submitted. “Post the Whale discovery we had some geological insights. It is not by accident we didn’t announce it until the day of the bid,” Andy Brown, Shell’s head of oil and gas production, told Reuters. “The nine blocks give us significant potential.”     The geological intelligence gleaned from the Whale discovery explains why Shell (RDSa.L) bid so aggressively for the Mexican blocks, something that had confounded industry experts.  It could also offer insight into the rationale underpinning its bet that Latin America - particularly Mexico and Brazil - will be a major source of new reserves as its current resources dwindle. Shell, or any other explorer, is not legally obliged to publicly disclose a discovery. The fact that its first major exploration success in over 10 years came adjacent to blocks coming up for auction was a matter of good fortune, while the timing of the announcement was canny. Shell has not yet released any estimates for the Whale’s recoverable resources, but two industry sources close to the exploration project put the figure at up to 700 million barrels of oil. That equates to about half of Shell’s 2017 oil production and would make the reservoir one of the biggest discoveries of the past decade in the industry. Shell declined to comment on the potential size of the reserves. Fossil fuels like oil are formed over millions of years in specific rock formations, which geologists and explorers try to identify via seismic studies and drilling to predict where resources might be found. But, even though a similar geology might increase the chances of similar exploration success, there are no guarantees, and luck is always a big factor. So there is no certainty that the Mexican blocks will yield commercial volumes of oil. (For a graphic on Shell's oil and gas reserves click reut.rs/2CrPZaI)  Shell acquired large amounts of specialized seismic data before the auction, about Whale and the Mexican blocks, to try to gain a better sense of the geological formations and potential oil reserves under the seabed, according to a source at an oil services company that provides such information.  “Even for us it was surprising the way Shell bid during Mexico’s deepwater auction. They really wanted the blocks close to the border, which indicates there must be a link between the formation in the U.S. and in Mexico,” the source added.  Shell needs to replenish its oil and gas reserves to maintain its production into the 2030s. Aside from the $54 billion acquisition of BG Group in 2016, which boosted its reserves, the company has had limited success in recent years.  Last year, it was able to replace only 27 percent of its production, while on a three-year average, the figure was 78 percent, the company disclosed in its full-year results. The decline in reserves means that at the end of 2017 Shell had enough reserves to sustain its production for 8.9 years, compared with around 10.5 years in 2015.  CEO Ben Van Beurden, while insisting he was not “obsessed” with the scale of his company’s reserves, said Shell was starting to work on restocking its resources. “We have a deepwater program that looks pretty good all the way into the next decade, but if you look at the second half of the next decade ... you will need new elements in the development funnel to sustain the cash-flow generation,” he told reporters after the annual results announcement last month. Shell has now given itself seven years to replenish its exploration program in order to sustain its deepwater production growth well into the 2030s, he added. The company, like many of its peers, was forced to dramatically slash spending in recent years because of weak oil prices, with its exploration budgets hit particularly hard. Now that prices have recovered to a near three-year high of around $65 a barrel, firms feel more confident to once again invest in expensive offshore developments. Shell owns a 60 percent stake in the Whale discovery with the remaining 40 percent held by Chevron (CVX.N), which is mainly shale-focused. The reservoir is located in the Perdido area, which has become a heartland of Shell’s deepwater activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.  Companies such as Shell that are eyeing Mexico’s offshore are hoping to use the vast infrastructure of pipelines and rigs on the U.S. side to reduce development costs, said Andrew Latham of Edinburgh-based consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

2018-03-02,"DAPCHI, Nigeria (Reuters) - Kachalla Bukar’s eyes filled with tears when he looked at a blue plastic basket containing his 14-year-old daughter’s belongings.  Aisha Kachalla is one of 110 girls abducted on Feb. 19 by suspected Boko Haram militants from her school in Dapchi, a dusty, remote town in the northeast Nigerian state of Yobe. The basket contains noodles, underwear, clothes and other items her parents packed to make her life at boarding school more comfortable — before it was interrupted by men shouting and brandishing weapons. Now those mundane items are the only connection he has to his daughter’s recent life while he and other parents wait for news. “When we went to school on Tuesday she was not among the girls that have been found,” he said, holding up a pink dress that was part of her school uniform. For the father-of-six, the box and its contents are keepsakes to be cherished but also a reminder of the moment he learned his second eldest daughter was missing.  “Her colleagues who have returned then gave us our daughter’s school box with her personal belongings. That was when we realised our daughter is actually missing,” he said. The Dapchi abductions may be one of the largest since Boko Haram took more than 270 schoolgirls from the northeastern town of Chibok in 2014. That case sparked an online campaign and spurred several governments into action to try and find them. Many of those girls remain in captivity, though some have escaped or been ransomed. Bukar is not the only parent to hold on to his daughter’s belongings. Others hold on to photographs of their girls.  Alhaji Audu Danga, 50, sat outside his mud house in Dapchi clad in a dark kaftan and held up two dresses, one pink and one blue, which were used to distinguish school attire and home clothing for the students. His missing 20-year-old daughter Falmata Audu is among the oldest of the school’s 906 students. Most are between 11 and 19. A Reuters team passed a military checkpoint, put in place following the attack, to enter the empty compound of the Government Girls Science and Technical College.  Empty single storey buildings containing classrooms and dormitories were spread across the sprawling site, interspersed with skeletal trees sprouting from red soil.  Messages daubed on walls, blackboards and rows of empty bunk beds provide a glimpse of school life while missing ceiling tiles in a dusty classroom hint at the poverty that is rife in northeast Nigeria. Amina Usman was one of the girls who escaped the jihadist group whose name roughly translates as “Western education is forbidden” in the Hausa language widely spoken in northern Nigeria. “I thought I will never see my parents or family again alive. I thought that was going to be the end of my life,” she said. “I don’t want to return to that school again, except if I get transfer to another place. I am scared, even if the government provide security.” Additional reporting by Ahmed Kingimi in Dapchi and Lanre Ola in Maiduguri; Writing by Alexis Akwagyiram; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg",https://uk.reuters.com/article/nigeria-security-parents/wider-image-parents-of-girls-abducted-from-nigerian-school-cherish-keepsakes-idUKL8N1QJ7L7,02 Mar 2018,"Kachalla Bukar's eyes

2018-03-02,"* Papua New Guinea quake triggers LNG export force majeure * “Beast from East” causes temperatures to plummet across Europe * UK spot gas prices jumped to record, Asia LNG also up By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, March 2 (Reuters) - Global natural gas markets were roiled this week as an earthquake in Papua New Guinea caused a large-scale supply disruption of liquefied natural gas (LNG) while a late winter blast in Europe triggered unprecedented price spikes. ExxonMobil Corp has declared force majeure on exports from its Papua New Guinea LNG project, which has been shut since a powerful earthquake on Monday, an industry source familiar with the matter said on Friday. A company declares a force majeure when it is unable to carry out a contract because of forces beyond its control. Exxon declined to comment on the force majeure. As a result, Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS jumped by 5 percent since last week, to $8.80 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). Exxon is having trouble gauging the extent of the earthquake’s damage, given the remoteness of the gas field, in the mountainous jungles of Papua New Guinea, 700 km (435 miles) from the export terminal. “It is difficult to assess the duration of production outages, but in our view, given the location and magnitude of the earthquake, as well as the scale of the aftershocks, we anticipate at least a month’s downtime is likely,” UBS bank said in an investor note on the earthquake’s likely impact on the LNG sector. The outage has left several North Asian buyers seeking replacement cargoes in the spot market, leading to a further rise in market activity, which already hit records in January. Several importers for China as well as Taiwan’s CPC Corp are seeking to replace disrupted contracted supplies from Papua with short-term delivery cargoes from the spot market, said three traders that participate in the market. Other traders said on Friday the seasonal drop-off in demand in North Asia - which includes Japan, China and South Korea, the world’s top three buyers - as winter ends and temperatures rise prevented a bigger price rise. Spot LNG prices for May were already $1 lower than April’s, at around $7.75 per mmBtu, the traders said. The market situation has also been eased by increasing supplies from Malaysia’s Bintulu LNG export facility, which had seen disruptions in recent weeks, said two traders with knowledge of the matter. While the winter in North Asia is showing signs of tapering off, most of Europe has been caught by a wave of extreme cold late in the season, which pushed up British spot natural gas prices to record highs of 275 pence per therm on March 1, the equivalent of over $30 per mmBtu, and up 130 percent from the last close in February, and up 400 percent since the end of December. The spike was a result of extreme cold across western Europe, caused by unusual Siberian winds which the media has dubbed “The Beast from the East” and which caused a surge in gas demand for heating as temperatures plummeted. European importers were vying with bids from Asia for spot LNG cargoes from Qatar and the United States, traders said. With warmer weather approaching in most of Europe, traders said the supply squeeze would likely ease into next week. Weather data in Thomson Reuters Eikon showed temperatures across most of western Europe will likely rise towards the seasonal norm of around 5 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit) within a week.

2018-03-02,"BANGKOK, March 2 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Villagers in northeastern India are threatening to disrupt the inauguration of a mega dam that has uprooted them from their traditional lands, campaigners said on Friday. Resistance to the dam is seen as part of a growing movement across the country against large infrastructure projects, which activists say do not benefit the very people forced to give up their land. Officials said the Mapithel dam in Manipur State is due to be opened on March 15 - nearly 30 years since construction began - and that it will vastly increase access to drinking water, irrigation and electricity. But those benefits “won’t even go to the affected communities who sacrificed their land, river, forest and resources,” said activist Jajo Themson. More protests are planned, he said, adding that previous demonstrations were put down with violence in a state where armed forces have special privileges to tackle a long-running insurgency. Pritam Singh, chief engineer of Manipur’s Irrigation and Flood Control Department, denied the use of force against lawful protests. All necessary permissions for the dam were obtained, and adequate compensation was given to those affected, said Singh. “Some people did not take the compensation, but that is a different matter. Rehabilitation of five of the six affected villages has been completed,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Almost 2,000 hectares of land, of which a third is forest, have been flooded, said Jiten Yumnam of the Centre for Research and Advocacy Manipur, an indigenous rights organisation. About 8,000 people in half a dozen villages are directly affected, with buildings and fields inundated by rising waters, he said. As the Thoubal River dried up, thousands more lost their livelihoods, including fishing and collecting and selling sandstone that used to be washed downstream, according to Yumnam. The dam has an annual irrigation potential of about 33,000 hectares, and will increase the drinking water supply to the state capital Imphal and surrounding areas by more than 45 million litres a day, according to a government audit. The project will generate 7.5 megawatts for rural electrification. Yumnam said authorities did not assess the dam’s impact on the environment and residents, who he said were not consulted. “We should not proceed with this until we can be sure of its impact,” he said. He added that a petition against the dam is still pending before the National Green Tribunal, a government body that deals with conservation cases. Of nearly 600 ongoing conflicts over land affecting nearly eight million people in India, more than a fifth relate to infrastructure projects, according to Land Conflict Watch, an Indian research organisation. At least a dozen conflicts relate to hydroelectric dam projects, its data showed. (Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran. Editing by Jared Ferrie.

2018-03-02,"* Trump’s tariff on steel and aluminium raises trade war fears * U.S. debt yields fall as trade worries dwarf inflation jitters * Yen jumps after Kuroda says mulls exit if inflation target met * European shares seen falling 0.6-0.9 pct By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, March 2 (Reuters) - Stock markets in Asia extended Wall Street’s overnight rout on Friday, with investors spooked by the spectre of a global trade war after President Donald Trump said the United States would impose hefty tariffs on imported steel and aluminium. Trump said duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium would be formally announced next week, sparking concerns of retaliatory moves from major trade partners such as China, Europe and neighbouring Canada. “The world stands on the brink of a trade war as Donald Trump announces severe tariffs on steel and aluminium - forget the yield curve - this is how recessions start,” said Robert Carnell, head of research, Asia-Pacific at ING in Singapore. “Trade is just about the only thing economists are agreed on — more is better.” European shares look set to fall, with spreadbetters expecting Germany’s Dax to shed 0.9 percent to approach last month’s five-month low, France’s Cac to drop 0.7 percent and Britain’s FTSE 0.6 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.9 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei tumbled 2.5 percent. For the week, they are down 2.1 percent and 3.3 percent respectively. Shares in Asian steelmakers slid, with South Korea’s Posco falling 3.3 percent and Japan’s Nippon Steel down 3.8 percent. Toyota Motor shares were down 2.4 percent after the automaker said the planned tariffs would substantially raise the production costs and therefore prices of cars and trucks sold in America. In China, Shanghai composite index dropped 0.6 percent. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 lost 36.16 points, or 1.33 percent, to 2,677.67 on Thursday, coming a day after investors sold off heavily on worries the Federal Reserve might increase rates more than expected this year. Trump’s latest trade salvo comes after Washington slapped steep tariffs on imports of solar panels and washing machines in January, prompting  China to launch an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation into imports of sorghum from the United States. The anxiety over tit-for-tat moves was underscored by Canada’s quick response, with officials in Ottawa saying they will retaliate against any U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium products. Markets are already fretting about the tempo of U.S. rate hikes this year, and now added to that is the fear escalating trade protectionism could dent global growth and corporate earnings - key drivers of last year’s rally in equities . Concerns over a harmful trade war eclipsed upbeat U.S. economic data published on Thursday, including a rise in the manufacturing index to 14-year highs and another showing the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits hitting a 48-year low. U.S. Treasury yields fell as the risk of a trade war appeared to push aside considerations of inflation, a major theme that spooked global financial markets earlier this year. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell to 2.811 percent, hitting its lowest level in three weeks and further extending the distance from its four-year peak of 2.957 percent touched on Feb 21. Some say, on the other hand, markets may be over-reacting. “Trump has been repeatedly boasting about the rise in share prices. If this is going to lead to a sustained drop in share prices, I’ll bet he is likely to change his stance,” said Nobuyuki Kashihara, head of research at Asset Management One. In the currency market, the dollar’s rebound following the bullish comments on the U.S. economy from new Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday lost momentum. The euro jumped back to $1.2271, after having hit a seven-week low of $1.21545 on Thursday. The yen got an additional boost when Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he would mull an exit from the BOJ’s current stimulus regime if the central bank’s 2 percent inflation target is achieved in 2019. The dollar dropped 0.4 percent to 105.79 yen, edging back towards its 15-month low of 105.545 set on Feb 16. The dollar index is down 2.1 percent this year, dogged by suspicions that the Trump administration prefers a weaker dollar to help narrow the United States’s yawning trade deficit. Worries that Trump’s big tax cuts and spending plans will ramp up fiscal deficits to the extent that they undermine confidence in U.S. debt have also hurt the greenback. Oil prices were also under pressure, having fallen more than 1 percent the previous day on trade friction fears. U.S. crude was little changed in late Asian trade at $60.93 per barrel, having fallen to two-week low of $60.18 on Thursday. It is down 3.7 percent so far this week. Brent futures traded at $63.85 per barrel after having hit a two-week low of $63.19.

2018-03-02,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Papua New Guinea has declared a state of emergency across its remote and rugged highlands, releasing government relief funds four days after a deadly quake flattened provincial towns and buried hamlets under landslides, killing at least 31 people. Stymied by forbidding terrain and weather, as well as damaged roads and runways, aid has not yet arrived in several large towns where it’s most needed, local officials told Reuters. “The only means of rescue is through helicopters and they are hardly coming,” Hela province’s administrator, William Bando, said on the phone from his office in a shipping container at Tari, about 40 km (25 miles) from the epicenter. “Our people live in scattered hamlets and people are dying slowly...A lot of people are asking for tents, water and medical supplies.” The emergency declaration, made late on Thursday by Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O’Neill cleared the way for 450 million kina ($135 million) in government aid to flow, as well as help from the military. “This is an unprecedented disaster and the appropriate response is underway by the national government,” O’Neill said in a statement, which also announced a restoration authority would direct recovery efforts for the next four years. (For a graphic on 'Papua New Guinea quake' click tmsnrt.rs/2ow1YLR) At least 13 people died when landslides covered remote hamlets close to where the quake struck, some 560 km (350 miles) northwest of the capital, Port Moresby, an official who put the total death toll at 31, told Reuters on Thursday. While the region has no major urban centers, around 670,000 people live within 100 km (62 miles) of the epicenter according to the Red Cross. Most of the other confirmed fatalities were in or around Tari township and provincial capital of Mendi, where at least 14 people died and aftershocks continue to frighten residents. “People have started to dig out and to recover dead bodies still in the ground,” Mendi policeman Naring Bongi said from his station, where desktop computers were smashed when the quake hit. “There is no help except for those who are here going around and collecting information on casualties and such things,” he said. “Our state of mind is not great. We are confused as to what is to be done to us in this case...the earth is still moving - it really frightens us, so we don’t know whatever to do, all the services in Mendi have closed.” The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it released $221,000 in funds to help relief efforts and would send first aid, water, mosquito nets and shelters, to the region. Australia has also promised A$200,000 in aid, sent a C-130 military plane to help with aerial surveys, and a spokeswoman at the foreign ministry told Reuters more help was on standby, should PNG request it. Miners and oil and gas companies were also assessing damage to their infrastructure, and an industry source said ExxonMobil Corp has declared force majeure on exports from its Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, which has been shut since the quake hit. The company declined to comment on the declaration, but said it would “take time” for a full survey of damage, given the quake ruined roads and other infrastructure. Earthquakes are common in Papua New Guinea, which sits on the Pacific Ocean’s “Ring of Fire,” a hotspot for seismic activity due to friction between tectonic plates.

Petronas, like other oil majors, has taken a hit from lower oil prices, but sharp cost cuts - along with some recent stability in oil prices - helped the company boost profits and margins despite lower production. Net profit for the fourth quarter ended December rose to 18.2 billion ringgit ($4.65 billion) from 11.3 billion ringgit in the same quarter last year, while revenue rose 13.8 percent to 61.8 billion ringgit. The quarterly result helped push full-year profit up 91 percent to 45.5 billion ringgit - marking a second year of profit growth for the sole manager of Malaysia’s oil and gas reserves following a two-year profit slump. “Petronas is now in stronger position to execute its long term growth agenda,” Chief Executive Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin said. “Petronas will explore new business areas, including speciality chemicals and new energy.” Petronas will focus on the ASEAN region, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East and the Americas for growth, he said, adding that the company will assess opportunities in solar energy. The company, traditionally conservative with its outlook, said its performance in 2018 will be “satisfactory” subject to the sustainability of the oil price - which the CEO said remains to be seen. It is budgeting for an oil price of $52 per barrel in 2018. Brent crude prices were trading at $63.99 on Friday. Wan Zulkiflee said industry wide costs are showing signs of increasing, driven by what he called “premature exuberance” over the oil price recovery. “It is imperative we do not drop the austerity mindset, and continue to ensure we keep costs under control, increase efficiency and drive up value,” he said. Petronas, a major contributor to Malaysia’s budget and one of the country’s biggest employers, embarked on a cost cutting drive after Wan Zulkiflee’s appointment as CEO in early 2015. The company said in 2016 that it would reduce expenses by $12 billion over a four-year period, and has cut thousands of jobs and its dividend payout to its sole shareholder, the Malaysian government. Controllable costs for 2017 fell 6 percent to 45.9 billion ringgit, Petronas said. For 2018, the company said it planned capital expenditure of around 55 billion ringgit, higher than last year’s 44.5 billion ringgit. It will also increase its dividend to the government this year to 19 billion ringgit, from 16 billion ringgit last year. Total production volume - the sum of Malaysia’s oil and gas output and Petronas’ international output - fell 2 percent to 2.32 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, while sales of liquefied natural gas (LNG) rose two percent to 30.7 million tonnes. $1 = 3.9140 ringgit

2018-03-02,"* Exxon: no comment on force majeure * Facility’s remote location makes inspection, repairs difficult * Project could be down for at least a month -UBS (Adds company and industry comments, details, graphic) By Osamu Tsukimori and Sonali Paul TOKYO/MELBOURNE, March 2 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp has declared force majeure on exports from its Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, which has been shut since a powerful earthquake on Monday, an industry source familiar with the matter said on Friday. At least 31 people were killed by the 7.5 magnitude quake, and Prime Minister Peter O’Neill has declared a state of emergency across the remote highlands region as rescuers struggle to reach villages buried by landslides. Exxon shut its $19 billion LNG facility, the country’s biggest export earner, amid fears of damage to gas field infrastructure and the pipeline that carries gas to the coast. Exxon declined to comment on Friday on whether it had invoked force majeure. A company spokeswoman reiterated that the company was focusing on assessing damage from the earthquake, a process that “is expected to take time particularly given the damage to roads and other infrastructure.” “We are continuing to work with our customers to minimize the impact on their business,” ExxonMobil PNG said in emailed comments, adding that its commercial arrangements were confidential. Exxon had earlier told buyers that the plant’s two LNG trains would be shut for at least seven days. The PNG LNG project has been producing at around 20 percent above its rated capacity of 6.9 million tonnes a year. Asian LNG market sources say there are concerns about a possible extended shutdown, which could affect not only the project’s four main buyers but also other buyers in Asia. “It is difficult to assess the duration of production outages, but in our view, given the location and magnitude of the earthquake, as well as the scale of the aftershocks, we anticipate at least a month’s downtime is likely,” UBS analysts said in a note this week. Uncertainty around production from PNG has drained liquidity from Asia’s spot LNG markets with buyers and sellers taking a wait-and-see approach before committing to trade, a market source said. This is reflected in the wide bid-offer spread on the forward-month contract for April, he added. The PNG LNG project is considered one of the world’s best-performing LNG operations. Exxon said earlier this month that together with its partners, France’s Total SA and Australia’s Oil Search Ltd, it plans to almost double the facility’s export capacity to 16 million tonnes per year. PNG LNG’s long-term buyers are top global LNG buyer JERA, Osaka Gas, Taiwan’s CPC and China’s Sinopec . JERA is a fuel joint venture between Tokyo Electric Power and Chubu Electric Power.

2018-03-02,"* Record volume of soybean imports to reduce palm oil use * High palm oil stocks also seen weighing on imports * Higher purchases of rapeseed oil to further curb demand By Naveen Thukral and Emily Chow SINGAPORE/KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 (Reuters) - China’s palm oil imports may fall in 2017/18 as the country instead boosts purchases of soybeans, giving it ample supplies of domestically produced soyoil, analysts and industry officials said. The world’s second-biggest economy, which ships more than 60 percent of soybeans traded worldwide, bought record volumes of the beans in 2017 as the country’s demand for protein-rich animal feed ingredient soymeal grows. But the waning of China’s appetite for palm oil - as well as its implications for soybeans - is set to be a key theme for the industry this year, and likely to be a hot topic at a major conference in Kuala Lumpur this week. Malaysia is the world’s second-biggest supplier after Indonesia of palm oil, used in the making of everything from cosmetics to food snacks. “(China’s) edible oil demand is not growing as fast as meal demand, so they have excessive supplies of soybeans,” said veteran industry official M.R. Chandran, now a consultant in Kuala Lumpur. “China is buying more soybeans and that demand is essentially driven by higher consumption of soymeal for feeding animals.” China’s soybean imports in 2017 hit an all-time high of 95.54 million tonnes, up 13.9 percent from last year’s 83.91 million tonnes, according to the country’s customs data. The country’s palm oil imports in 2017/18 are expected to decline to 4.8 million tonnes as compared 4.881 million tonnes a year ago, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates issued on Feb. 8. Meanwhile, Malaysian palm oil futures traded on the Bursa Malaysia Derivative Exchange have risen around 2 percent in February after declining for the last three months. Market watchers have ascribed the earlier declines to rising production in Southeast Asia. But February prices climbed on tight market supplies as recent rains curbed harvesting activities. Existing high palm oil stocks in China of about 600,000 tonnes are also expected to depress demand, said David Ng, a derivatives specialist at Phillip Futures in Kuala Lumpur. “Current stock levels are above market expectation as well as average levels,” he said. “Keep in mind China’s demand for soymeal is going to increase again this year, and that will increase crush margins and overall demand for soyoil, which will impact demand for palm.” Elsewhere, China’s rapeseed imports are set to rise to 4.7 million tonnes this year, up from 4.26 million tonnes a year ago, according to the USDA. “Rapeseed oil demand will increase as it becomes cheaper. There is parity to import canola oil from Canada as there are good margins,” said one trader in Singapore. “They have bumper (canola) crops in most areas of Canada and Australia, so the seed becomes cheaper.” Reporting by Naveen Thukral in SINGAPORE and Emily Chow in

2018-03-02,"CALGARY, Alberta, March 2 (Reuters) - Canada’s First Nations are boosting investments and leveraging their clout with regulators to gain stakes in oil and gas projects as they seek greater returns on energy produced or transported across their territory. Aboriginal groups in Canada have traditionally played a more passive role in the energy industry, collecting royalties from oil and gas output. That model is changing as some indigenous groups buy oil wells and negotiate ownership stakes in proposed pipelines and storage projects. “It’s assets that create cash flow,” said Joe Dion, Chief Executive of First Nations-owned Frog Lake Energy Resources Corp, which produces 2,000 barrels of oil per day. “We get a piece of the action.” First Nations, also called bands, play a pivotal role in Canada’s oil industry because governments and companies have a legal duty to consult and accommodate them before proceeding with resource projects affecting their territories. The law gives bands “pretty close to an effective veto,” said University of Saskatchewan professor Ken Coates. Some aboriginal groups have used that leverage to stop or delay oil projects, as when Enbridge Inc’s proposed Northern Gateway pipeline was rejected by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in 2016 after bands raised environmental concerns. Other indigenous groups, however, are increasingly using the same power to negotiate ownership stakes in projects. A bigger financial role for First Nations in the sector could help unlock oil and gas reserves in Canada, the world’s fifth largest producer, that might otherwise stay in the ground because of objections from environmental or aboriginal rights groups. Their experience parallels that of Native American tribes, who are also deeply split on whether and how to develop the vast resources on tribal lands. Indigenous Canadians make up about 5 percent of the nation’s population and face higher levels of poverty and violence, giving bands a powerful incentive to maximize energy revenues to raise living standards. “It’s so polarized,” said Stephen Buffalo, chief executive of the advocacy group Indian Resource Council. “Some want to see the benefit, others think it’s going to kill the earth.” Frog Lake, a firm owned by Alberta’s Frog Lake First Nation, is looking to buy more oil-producing properties outside of its territory along with stakes in tank farms and pipelines, said Dion, who is a member of the neighboring Kehewin Cree Nation. Dion said aboriginal groups have traditionally settled for “the smaller stuff” - royalties from outside energy firms. “The revenue-sharing piece is here now,” Dion said. “That is where we have to go.” Aboriginal groups have a legal say in projects on their lands, which are held in trust by the Canadian government for band members, and also those that might impact them indirectly. First Nations’ support gives energy firms better odds of overcoming any concerns from other aboriginal groups. Ottawa on Feb. 8 unveiled draft legislation for resource projects that places greater emphasis on considering their impact on aboriginal communities. Under the rules for assessing major projects, to take effect next year, such concerns will be heard by the new Canadian Energy Regulator and Impact Assessment Agency of Canada. Examples of First Nations taking bigger roles in energy projects are mounting. RBC Capital Markets’ North American head of project finance Mark Saar said the bank is seeing more pipeline and storage companies seeking financial partnerships with aboriginals. RBC in December completed a C$545 million bond issue for the Fort McKay and Mikisew Cree bands - the largest ever private investment by a First Nation - allowing them to buy a 49 percent stake in a Suncor Energy storage facility. “The deal was oversubscribed,” Saar said. “We think there would be appetite for further similar deals.” Some investors find aboriginals’ involvement in energy projects appealing given that their support is often critical for regulatory approvals, Saar said. Others, however, worry about being tied to First Nations’ finances because of historic mismanagement by some bands. Investors and lenders are displaying “greater acceptance of First Nations as players,” said David Sharpe, a Mohawk aboriginal and Chief Executive of Toronto-based debt firm Bridging Finance, referring to RBC’s bond issue. Bridging Finance last year financed an unnamed First Nation’s C$11 million purchase of stakes in producing oil wells and is working on four more similar deals, Sharpe said. Investment bank AltaCorp Capital is raising funds for a C$16 billion ($12.85 billion) oil pipeline, proposed to run from Alberta to the northern British Columbia coast. The project has modest financial backing from one of Canada’s richest families, the Aquilini Group, and support from 35 First Nations to use their land. In exchange for allowing that access, the bands will own at least 35 percent of the pipeline and a corresponding share of the profits. If built, Eagle Spirit would be a crucial second outlet to the Pacific Ocean for crude from the oil sands, which currently sells at a steep discount because of transportation constraints. Eagle Spirit Energy Holdings’ proposed oil pipeline has strong interest from energy companies and investors, said Eagle Spirit president and chairman Calvin Helin, who is aboriginal. The firm’s main roadblock is a proposed government moratorium against oil tankers along the ecologically sensitive northern B.C. coast. Two other private investor groups, A2A and G7G - with the political support of some First Nations - are proposing to build railways running from Alberta’s oil sands to Alaska, avoiding the coastline of British Columbia because of the pipeline opposition there. Matt Vickers, head of G7G, declined to detail the investors’ financial arrangements with the bands. New railways could provide an alternative to Kinder Morgan Canada’s  Trans Mountain pipeline expansion from Alberta to British Columbia, which has been delayed by one year due to the environmental concerns of the B.C. government, some aboriginals and municipalities. When Chief Isaac Laboucan-Avirom became leader of Alberta’s Woodland Cree Nation in 2013, he was struck by the contrast between his band’s precarious finances and the hydrocarbon wealth surrounding its territory. Three years later, Laboucan-Avirom signed an agreement allowing Baytex Energy Corp to drill in exchange for modest royalties and jobs. Now, the Woodland Cree are granting permission for Eagle Spirit pipeline to use its land - in exchange for an undisclosed ownership stake. Such opportunities have won over some groups trying to balance economic prosperity with environmental protection. “There’s been a real awakening,” said Laboucan-Avirom, who is looking for further investment in oil and gas assets. “Everything in our world is touched by oil and gas, whether we like it or not.” ($1 = 1.2453 Canadian dollars) (Additional reporting by Valerie Volcovici in Washington; Editing by Simon Webb and Brian Thevenot)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/canada-oil-aboriginal/canadas-first-nations-seek-bigger-stakes-profits-from-oil-sector-idUKL1N1OZ0YP,02 Mar 2018,"Canada's First Nations

2018-03-02,"* Trump’s tariff on steel and aluminium raises trade war fears * U.S. debt yields fall as trade worries dwarf inflation jitters * U.S. junk bonds post largest fall since Nov 2016 By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, March 2 (Reuters) - Stock markets in Asia on Friday extended a Wall Street rout, as investors were spooked by the spectre of a global trade war after President Donald Trump announced the United States would impose hefty tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Trump said duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium would be formally announced next week, sparking concerns of retaliatory moves from major trade partners like China, Europe and neighbouring Canada in a blow to the global economy. “The world stands on the brink of a trade war as Donald Trump announces severe tariffs on steel and aluminium - forget the yield curve - this is how recessions start,” said Robert Carnell, head of research, Asia-Pacific at ING In Singapore. “Trade is just about the only thing economists are agreed on - more is better.” MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 1.1 percent, led by a fall in South Korean shares while Japan’s Nikkei tumbled 2.9 percent. For the week, they are down 2.3 percent and 3.6 percent respectively. Asian steelmaker shares dropped, with South Korea’s Posco falling 3 percent and Japan’s Nippon Steel 4 percent. Toyota Motor shares were down 2.4 percent as the automaker said the planned tariffs would substantially raise costs and therefore prices of cars and trucks sold in America. Mainland Chinese shares recouped some of the opening losses, with the Shanghai composite index down just 0.4 percent. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 lost 36.16 points, or 1.33 percent, to 2,677.67 on Thursday, coming a day after investors sold off heavily on worries the Federal Reserve might increase rates more than expected this year.

The concerns of a harmful trade war eclipsed the upbeat U.S. economic data published on Thursday, including a rise in the manufacturing index to 14-year highs and another showing the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits hitting a 48-year low. U.S. inflation picked up as the PCE price index, a gauge of underlying inflation, advanced 0.3 percent in January - the largest gain since January 2017. On the year, it posted an increase of 1.5 percent, in line with the previous two months. “Even if you manufacture goods, if someone doesn’t buy them, you have to scale back your production, leading to slowdown in global economic activities,” said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank. “I would expect markets entered another period of correction,” he added. U.S. Treasury yields fell as the risk of a trade war appeared to push aside considerations of inflation, a major theme that spooked global financial markets earlier this year.

2018-03-02,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday proposed changes to rules regulating coal ash waste from power plants that it said would give states more flexibility over its disposal and save electric utilities up to $100 million a year in compliance costs.  The proposal includes more than a dozen changes to an Obama-era rule that established minimum national standards for the disposal of coal ash, a byproduct of coal-based power plants that contains toxic materials such as arsenic and lead. “Today’s coal ash proposal embodies EPA’s commitment to our state partners by providing them with the ability to incorporate flexibilities into their coal ash permit programs based on the needs of their states,” EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in a statement. In September, the EPA said it would reconsider the Obama-era rule after utility industry groups petitioned for changes.    Environmental groups warned in September that if the EPA rolled back the safeguards, it would put the public at risk because coal ash pits are located near waterways and groundwater.  The agency said it would be accepting public comment on the proposal for 45 days and planned to hold a public hearing.

2018-03-02,"(Corrects the last name of the Petroperu official to Alva Hart from Hart) By Mitra Taj LIMA, March 1 (Reuters) - Peru plans to declare the country’s sole oil pipeline a “strategic asset” so the military can protect it from a string of vandalism attacks, the pipeline’s operator, state-owned Petroperu and a Cabinet spokesman told Reuters. The spokesman said on Thursday that the center-right government of Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski will ask Congress to approve the move “in coming days.” The attacks in a remote Amazonian region over the past two years have made investors nervous at a time when Peru, a relatively small oil producer, is seeking to shore up slumping output, said Beatriz Alva Hart, a Petroperu manager for relations with communities near the pipeline. The 1,106 km (687 mile) pipeline transports crude from jungle oil blocks tapped by Frontera Energy Corp and Perenco to Petroperu’s refinery on the Pacific coast. Since the start of 2016, some 11,100 barrels of oil have spilled from the pipeline in 14 attacks, and 5,600 barrels spilled because of corrosion or operative failures, data from environmental regulator OEFA showed. “We’re exhausting all of our efforts to maintain the integrity of our pipeline,” Alva Hart said in an interview on Wednesday. “The pipeline will soon be qualified as infrastructure that’s a strategic asset for the Peruvian state,” allowing the military and not just the police to protect it. Petroperu suspects local businesses hired to clean up oil from two corrosion-induced ruptures in early 2016 have been behind the subsequent spate of vandalism. The pipeline was cut open again by suspected vandals on Tuesday, spilling 40 barrels from a pipeline section inoperative since last month over issues with crude quality, Alva Hart said. “We’re no longer going to hire those kinds of companies, because it creates a sort of perverse incentive,” said Alva Hart, explaining one way Petroperu hoped to discourage more attacks. Petroperu will use companies and workers outside the Amazonian region instead, she said. To help indigenous residents find steady work, Petroperu has been hiring them to clear paths to the pipeline so Petroperu can better maintain it, Alva Hart said. “We’re rebuilding relations with communities,” Alva Hart said.

2018-03-02,"* Trump’s tariff on steel and aluminium raises trade war fears * U.S. debt yields fall as trade worries dwarf inflation jitters * U.S. junk bonds post largest fall since Nov 2016 By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, March 2 (Reuters) - Stock markets in Asia on Friday extended a Wall Street rout as investors were rattled after President Donald Trump announced the United States would impose hefty tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, raising the spectre of a global trade war. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.8 percent, led by a fall in South Korean shares while Japan’s Nikkei tumbled 2.4 percent. Asian steelmaker shares dropped, with South Korea’s Posco falling 3 percent and Japan’s Nippon Steel 4 percent. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 lost 36.16 points, or 1.33 percent, to 2,677.67 on Thursday, coming a day after the investors sold off heavily on worries the Federal Reserve might increase rates more than expected this year. “The world stands on the brink of a trade war as Donald Trump announces severe tariffs on steel and aluminium - forget the yield curve - this is how recessions start,” said Robert Carnell, head of research, Asia-Pacific at ING In Singapore. “Trade is just about the only thing economists are agreed on - more is better.” Trump said the duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium would be formally announced next week, although White House officials later said some details still needed to be ironed out. Investors fear Trump’s decision could spark retaliatory moves from major trade partners like China, Europe and neighbouring Canada in a blow to the global economy. The anxiety was underscored by Canada’s quick response, with officials in Ottawa saying they will retaliate against any U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium products. The concerns of a harmful trade war eclipsed the upbeat U.S. economic data published on Thursday, including a rise in the manufacturing index to 14-year highs and another showing the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits hitting a 48-year low. U.S. inflation picked up as the PCE price index, a gauge of underlying inflation, advanced 0.3 percent in January - the largest gain since January 2017. On the year, it posted an increase of 1.5 percent, in line with the previous two months. “Even if you manufacture goods, if someone doesn’t buy them, you have to scale back your production, leading to slowdown in global economic activities,” said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank. “I would expect markets entered another period of correction,” he added. U.S. Treasury yields fell as the risk of a trade war appeared to push aside considerations of inflation, a major theme that spooked global financial markets earlier this year. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell to 2.811 percent, hitting its lowest level in three weeks and further extending the distance from its four-year peak of 2.957 percent touched on Feb 21. Some say, on the other hand, markets may be over-reacting. “Trump has been repeatedly boasting about rise in share prices. If this is going to lead to a sustained drop in share prices, I bet he is likely to change his stance,” said Nobuyuki Kashihara, head of research at Asset Management One. In the currency market, the dollar’s rebound following the bullish comments on the U.S. economy from new Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday lost steam. The euro jumped back to $1.2271, after having hit a seven-week low of $1.21545 on Thursday. The dollar slipped to 106.14 yen, edging back towards its 15-month low of 105.545 set on Feb 16. The dollar index is still down 2.1 percent this year, dogged by suspicions that the Trump administration prefers a weaker dollar to mend its bulging trade deficit. Worries that Trump’s big tax cuts and spending plans may boost fiscal deficits to the extent that they undermine confidence in U.S. debt have also dragged on the greenback. Oil prices were also under pressure, having fallen more than one percent the previous day as Trump’s trade move raised worried about the global economy. U.S. crude traded at $61.19 per barrel, up 0.4 percent in Asia on Friday after having fallen to two-week low of $60.18 on Thursday. It is down 3.7 percent so far this week.

2018-03-02,"(Corrects final paragraph to show total volumes are 1.5 millon tonnes) By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, March 1 (Reuters) - Chinese gas distributor ENN will have the first phase of the country’s first privately owned liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal ready by the middle of this year, a company official said on Thursday. Construction of the 3 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) Zhoushan terminal in China’s eastern Zhejiang region is more than 90 percent complete, with commissioning expected in the middle of 2018, said Ma Shenyuan, vice president of ENN Energy Holdings. The company is also considering expanding the terminal by adding 15 mtpa in phases two and three, he said at an LNG conference in Singapore. ENN is also planning to set up a purchasing and trading office in Singapore over the next few weeks, he added. With China’s LNG demand expected to grow by more than 10 percent on average over the next three years, Ma expects the country’s LNG imports to easily hit 50 million tonnes by 2020 from last year’s 38 million tonnes. “New LNG contracts are needed to meet demand,” he said. China last year overtook South Korea to become the world’s second-biggest importer of LNG behind Japan, driven by a government gasification programme that switched millions of households to using natural gas rather than coal for household heating. ENN has signed long-term deals including sales and purchase agreements with Chevron Corp and Australia’s Origin Energy and also has an agreement to buy LNG from Total . The deals total about 1.5 million tonnes a year of LNG. Reporting by Jessica Jaganathan

2018-03-02,"TOKYO, March 2 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices rose on Friday, snapping three days of declines and taking a breather after steep falls this week that wiped out recent gains made on hopes a global oil glut is coming to an end. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was up 25 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $61.24 by 0056 GMT. On Thursday 1.1 percent to touch a two-week low of $60.18. Global benchmark Brent was yet to trade, having settled down 1.4 percent on Thursday at $63.83 a barrel, also a two-week low. WTI is on track for a 3.6 percent drop this week, its first weekly decline in three, having given up much of its gains of recent weeks when sentiment was boosted by a fall in stocks at the Cushing delivery point for WTI. “Although destocking in Cushing has continued, with stocks there falling below 30 million barrels for the first time since late 2014, the overall increase in U.S. oil stocks has overshadowed the good news,” Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said in a note. Stocks continued to fall at Cushing in Oklahoma, with inventories down by 1.2 million barrels, the 10th consecutive week of declines, the Energy Information Administration said this week. Still, total U.S. crude stocks rose last week even as refineries hiked output, increasing by 3 million barrels in the week to Feb. 23, compared with expectations for an increase of 2.1 million barrels. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will hold a dinner on Monday in Houston with U.S. shale firms, two industry sources said, the latest sign of the producer group widening talks about how best to tame a global oil glut. U.S. crude output slipped in the last month of 2017, but in November hit an all-time high of 10.057 million barrels per day (bpd). Weekly data showed another record and further gains are expected. Fawad says the market has been ignoring “good compliance with the production cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC countries”. A Reuters survey on Wednesday found OPEC production fell in February to a 10-month low. Still, “OPEC will not be able to keep its production agreement with other non-OPEC members for too long should the U.S. continue to win more market share,” he said.
