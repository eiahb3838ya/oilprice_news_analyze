2018-02-22,"TOKYO/SEOUL (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization largely upheld a Japanese complaint against South Korean import bans and additional testing requirements imposed on Japanese seafood because of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. A WTO dispute panel said that South Korea’s measures were initially justified, but that keeping them in place violated the WTO’s sanitary and phyto-sanitary (SPS) agreement. “Japan welcomes the panel’s decision and hopes that South Korea will sincerely and swiftly take corrective action,” Japan’s Fisheries Agency and Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. South Korea’s government said on Friday said it will appeal the ruling and will keep the ban in place.      Japan, which has been in talks with other countries such as China and Taiwan that also have trade restrictions in place, plans to step up talks with them in light of the WTO ruling, a government official said.  Many countries have removed or relaxed restrictions on produce from Japan in the wake of the Fukushima disaster, which led to meltdowns at a nuclear plant and forced Japan to suspend some agricultural and fisheries exports. Some countries have maintained bans on imports, but South Korea is the only one that Japan has taken to the WTO. South Korea widened its initial ban on Japanese fishery imports in 2013 to cover all seafood from eight Japanese prefectures including Fukushima.  Japan launched its trade complaint at the WTO in 2015, arguing that radioactive levels were safe and that a number of other nations, including the United States and Australia, had lifted or eased Fukushima-related restrictions. South Korea imported 10.9 billion yen ($102 million) worth of Japanese seafood in the year to August 2013 before it broadened its restrictions. Those imports then fell to 8.4 billion yen the following year, according to the Japanese government. Relations between Japan and South Korea, often testy, have soured in recent years.

2018-02-22,"(Reuters) - First Solar Inc (FSLR.O) said on Thursday it would restart some production at its Ohio factory that was stopped late last year and hire new employees due to robust demand for its solar panels both in the United States and overseas. The U.S. solar company, which makes products both overseas and in Perrysburg, Ohio, had shut down the lines to prepare to produce a next-generation panel known as the Series 6. Demand for the company’s existing Series 4, however, has proved to be so strong that it will restart two of those production lines. The company will hire about 130 employees to run those lines. The Ohio facility currently has about 800 workers, according to spokesman Steve Krum. The additional production will contribute 180 megawatts of volume to the company’s 3.1 gigawatt production forecast for the year, it said. First Solar has benefited from having a technology that is not subject to the 30 percent tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on solar imports last month. Its panels are made from cadmium telluride, while the tariffs apply only to traditional silicon solar products. The company has also enjoyed increased demand for its panels outside the United States. “Whether we continue to run these lines beyond 2018 will depend on market conditions,” Chief Executive Mark Widmar told analysts on a conference call to discuss the company’s fourth-quarter results.   First Solar reported a smaller-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter. However, the company’s 2017 net sales missed its forecast and it lowered the gross margin outlook for 2018, sending the shares down 4.3 percent to $63.41 in after-market trading. The company reported 2017 full-year net sales of $2.94 billion, below its forecast of $3 billion to $3.1 billion.  First Solar said it expects 2018 gross margin to be in the range of 21.5 percent to 22.5 percent, down from its prior forecast of 22 to 23 percent. It cited changes in its revenue mix for the lowered view. The solar panel maker raised its 2018 earnings per share forecast to between $1.50 and $1.90 from $1.25 to $1.75. The company’s net loss narrowed to $432.45 million, or $4.14 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from a loss of $750.79 million, or $7.22 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company lost 25 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of a loss of 31 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

2018-02-22,"VANCOUVER (Reuters) - British Columbia on Thursday edged back from its pledge to block increased shipments of crude oil through the Pacific Coast province, saying it is now pursuing legal advice on whether it has jurisdiction to impose the temporary ban. The province sparked a trade war with neighbouring Alberta last month, when it announced numerous new environmental rules, including plans to bar any increase in heavy oil shipments while a panel studied the impact of heavy oil spills. “We believe it is our right to take appropriate measures to protect our environment, economy and our coast from the drastic consequence of a diluted bitumen spill,” said British Columbia Premier John Horgan in a statement. “And we are prepared to confirm that right in the courts.” The proposed rules were seen as a direct attack on Kinder Morgan Canada’s (KML.TO) C$7.4 billion ($5.8 billion) Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, which would nearly triple capacity on an existing pipeline from Alberta’s energy heartland to a Metro Vancouver port. In response, Alberta’s premier, Rachel Notley, imposed a ban on the sale British Columbia wine, and called on the federal government to step in to assert its jurisdiction over the project. The Trans Mountain expansion was approved by Canada in 2016, but has been repeatedly delayed by permitting issues. Horgan said his government is retaining legal counsel to pursue the jurisdictional issues in court, but that the process could take several weeks. In the meantime, the province will proceed with the other measures around oil spill preparedness, response, and compensation.

2018-02-22,"(Adds financial details, company background.) SAO PAULO, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Brazilian energy and logistics company Cosan SA Indústria e Comércio on Thursday reported a net profit of 686 million reais ($211.10 million) in the quarter ended Dec. 31, up from 183 million reais a year earlier. Cosan said it benefited from the recovery in the Brazilian economy, citing larger fuel and natural gas sales compared with the year-earlier quarter. Cosan, which is a partner of Royal Dutch Shell Plc in the world’s largest sugar maker, Raízen, reported earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) of 2.19 billion reais versus 1.35 billion reais in the same period in 2016. The Raízen joint venture is also Brazil’s third-largest fuel distributor, managing a network of gas stations under the Shell brand. Cosan said fuel sales increased 4 percent in the fourth quarter. Diesel sales were particularly strong, jumping 9 percent, due to higher demand from the agricultural sector. Cosan said the sugar business suffered from low global prices for the sweetener. As a result, the company shifted the production mix of its mills in Brazil toward ethanol. The company said it allocated 48 percent of sugar cane to sugar production in the fourth quarter compared with 56 percent in the same quarter in 2016. The firm, which controls Brazil’s largest natural gas distributor, Comgás, reported a 4 percent jump on gas consumption in Brazil late last year.

2018-02-22,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) may take part in a race to supply Canada with 88 new fighter jets and stands an equal chance with other bidders even though it is locked in a trade dispute with Ottawa, a senior Canadian official said on Thursday. Procurement Minister Carla Qualtrough made her comments shortly after the Liberal government released a list of five companies that would be allowed to compete. Boeing, along with U.S. rival Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), is on the list of approved suppliers. Canada is due to release the exact specifications for the jets next year. Officials say the deal is worth between C$15 billion ($11.80 billion) and C$19 billion. Although Boeing angered Canada last year by launching a trade challenge against planemaker Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO), Qualtrough said the dispute would not necessarily harm Boeing if it chose to enter its F-18 Super Hornet. “All the five teams on the supplier list have an equal chance,” she said in a phone interview when asked about Boeing’s prospects given the Bombardier row. None of the contenders are obliged to take part. Boeing spokesman Scott Day said the aerospace giant would  continue to evaluate its participation in the competition.     A U.S. trade commission last month dismissed Boeing’s complaint that Bombardier was dumping planes on the American market at “absurdly low” prices. Canadian officials have privately made it clear that Boeing needs to drop the matter to stand a better chance of winning the fighter jet contract, say well-placed sources. Ottawa has made clear that bids will be evaluated in part by whether firms have caused any past economic damage to Canada - a clear reference to Boeing. But on Thursday Qualtrough said: “We haven’t decided how far back into the past companies’ (actions) will be analyzed.” Canada is remaining in the nine-nation consortium that helped fund development of the F-35, which has prompted some defense analysts to suggest the jet has an advantage going into the competition. “We’re aware of that perception and we are working very hard to make sure that the process is fair and transparent,” said Qualtrough. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau initially opposed the F-35 on the grounds that it was too costly, but Ottawa has since softened its line. The government said the other companies eligible to take part are: Airbus EAD.PA, which makes the Eurofighter; Saab AB SAAB.b.ST, which makes the Gripen; and Dassault Aviation (AVMD.PA), which makes the Rafale.

2018-02-22,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text) * State-run Coal India struggles to meet demand * Petcoke bans, duties trigger coal imports from cement makers * Struggling railway network creates coal supply bottlenecks By Sudarshan Varadhan BAMBOLIM, India, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Caught between logistical bottlenecks and surging demand from power plants, India will likely increase coal imports in 2018, industry executives said, in what would be a setback to the government’s plans to cut the country’s dependence on foreign supplies. The projected higher coal demand, which would reverse two years of declines, will be a boon for international miners such as Indonesia’s Adaro Energy, Australia’s Whitehaven Coal or global commodity merchant Glencore. But, the country’s power plants and cement makers, the source of the resurgent demand, will end up eating the cost of the higher-priced imports. State-owned Coal India, the world’s second-biggest coal miner by production, is grappling with a shortage of trains to carry the fuel from its mines to the country’s power plants, according to the minutes of government meeting held on a Jan. 22 and reviewed by Reuters. India’s thermal coal imports may rise as much as 4 percent this year, with a steady 3 percent to 5 percent of growth expected over the next five years, a senior executive at Adani Enterprises, the country’s biggest coal trader, told Reuters. “They (power plants) are not going to get the coal from Coal India as they were promised because of limitations on the infrastructure side,” said Rajendra Singh, Adani’s chief operating officer for coal trading. “Now, either you shut down, or you absorb the price (of imports)” he said. The train shortage in India has left about 10 power stations without spare coal supplies and 45 other plants with stockpiles that are less than seven days of consumption, the government meeting minutes showed. In a statement, Coal India said that the company was given a target of 288 trains of coal per day for the fiscal year ending March 2019. In February, the company is averaging 264.2 trains per day and reached a peak of 286 on a single day. The company also said that the start up of two new railway lines should add between eight to 10 trains. India needs a total of 332 coal trains per day to meet end-user demand, according to the Jan 22 meeting minutes. The stretched supply chains and higher costs for imports are worrying Indian power companies. “The question is, how far do you stretch a rubber band? Today, it is pretty stretched,” said Vipul Tuli, chief executive officer of power company Sembcorp’s India unit, referring to the rising costs of imported coal. After years without significant imports, state-run utilities in the states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat, have ordered several cargoes of Indonesian coal over the last month, Adani’s Singh said on the sidelines of an industry event in Bambolim in India’s Goa state last week. The utilities did not respond to calls for comment. The surge in imports has created a traffic jam of about 200 ships outside Indian ports, shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon showed. Data from consultants Wood Mackenzie shows that India’s seaborne imports of thermal coal fell 3.3 percent to 147 million tonnes in 2017. Rodrigo Echeverri, head of hard commodities research at Noble Group, said last week that Indian coal imports will rise in 2018 after falling for two straight years. Power generators are not the only source of additional coal demand. Cement makers are buying coal to replace the petroleum coke they use to fuel furnaces that make cement from minerals. In October, India banned the use around the capital of New Delhi of petroleum coke, or petcoke, a highly polluting fuel that is the solid remnants left over from processing fuel oil into fuels at oil refineries. While cement companies have gained exemptions from the ban, they are replacing some of their petcoke with coal to avoid production delays. Petcoke consumption by cement makers will likely fall by 10 percent to 15 percent in 2018, said Kirik C. Gandhi, an executive at Shree Cement, adding that they will diversify into other fuels, mainly imported coal. To further reduce petcoke consumption, the country in December raised the import duty on the fuel to 10 percent from 2.5 percent. Australian mining giant BHP said this week that the duty increase, which mostly impacts cement manufacturing, “is expected to add roughly 20 to 25 million tonnes to coal demand.” “We are all geared up (for more coal imports) because this question will come again for sure,” said Sanjay Kumar, an executive from cement maker Lafarge Holcim, referring to the potential for restrictions on petcoke usage.

2018-02-22,"JOHANNESBURG, Feb 22 (Reuters) - A South African minister inadvertently misled parliament when she said a local consultancy firm linked to business friends of former President Jacob Zuma had no contracts with state power utility Eskom, a anti-graft watchdog said on Thursday. New President Cyril Ramaphosa should take action within 14 days against the Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown, whose department oversees enterprises including Eskom, said Busisiwe Mkhwebane, head of the Public Protectors office. “Minister Brown inadvertently misled Parliament in her assertion that there were no other contracts of engagement concluded between Eskom and Trillian,” said Mkhwebane in her report, adding that she breached a ministerial code of ethics. Brown’s spokesman said he would issue a statement later. This is the latest blow to a senior government official and comes as Ramaphosa is considering a cabinet reshuffle after replacing Zuma, whose rule was marred by a series of scandals. Zuma’s business associates include three brothers from the Gupta family who have been accused of using their political connections to win state contracts and influence cabinet appointments. Zuma and the Gupta brothers deny wrongdoing. Ramaphosa replaced Zuma as head of the ruling African National Congress in December having pledged to fight official corruption. Last week the party elected him head of state as Zuma resigned under political pressure.

2018-02-22,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Most U.S. stocks advanced on Thursday, rebounding from a day earlier, and bond yields eased off highs following more cautious talk about the potential for interest rate increases this year. Oil prices also rose, in part because the U.S. dollar hit session lows in morning trading after having touched a 10-day high, as the euro was boosted by minutes from the European Central Bank’s most recent policy meeting. Major equity indexes, on track to snap a recent spate of declines, were also buoyed by gains in industrials and energy shares. Comments from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard on Thursday appeared to ease some investor concerns about the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting.  Minutes from that meeting, released on Wednesday, showed policymakers were more confident about the need to keep raising U.S. interest rates, with most believing inflation would climb. But Bullard told CNBC on Thursday that central bankers need to be careful not to increase rates too quickly this year because that could slow the economy.  “Bullard made a comment on rates. That’s what has given the market a reason to see a little bit of a positive future,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth in New York. “After yesterday’s Fed minutes, the market is watching some of these Fed presidents’ speeches more closely,” said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. “People are just looking for any clue they can about rate hikes going forward, so they are taking every word that these guys say to heart.” Benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year yields <US10YT=RR > slipped from their four-year high hit in the previous session. The notes last rose 6/32 in price to yield 2.9207 percent, from 2.941 percent late on Wednesday. Bond prices, which usually move inversely to yields, pared gains after the U.S. government sold new seven-year notes to slightly soft demand, the final sale of $258 billion in debt this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 164.7 points, or 0.66 percent, to 24,962.48; the S&P 500 gained 2.63 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,703.96; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 8.14 points, or 0.11 percent, to 7,210.09. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.10 percent. European shares dipped. A flurry of corporate results failed to lift sentiment after speculation about U.S. interest rates soured risk appetite globally. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.15 percent and emerging market stocks fell 0.64 percent.  The latest minutes from the ECB showed it retaining its dovish stance and said even changes in communication would be “premature.” In Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, data showed business confidence fell more than expected in February. Though Germany is set for solid growth in the first quarter, diverging monetary policy expectations with the United States sent the “trans-Atlantic spread” between German and U.S. 10-year borrowing costs to 222 bps, the highest in more than a year. The U.S. dollar slipped against a basket of major currencies as a rally from a three-year low last week ran out of steam, and heightened volatility led investors to favour the Japanese yen, considered a safe haven currency, sending it up. The dollar index fell 0.25 percent, with the euro up 0.36 percent to $1.2326. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.96 percent versus the greenback to 106.75 per dollar. Oil prices rose to two-week highs, boosted by the weaker dollar and data showing a surprise draw in U.S. crude inventories and the weaker dollar. U.S. crude rose 1.65 percent to $62.70 per barrel and Brent was last at $66.30, up 1.35 percent on the day.

2018-02-22,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose to two-week highs on Thursday, boosted by data showing a surprise draw in U.S. crude inventories and also by a drop in the dollar. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose $1.09, or about 1.8 percent, to settle at $62.77 a barrel. U.S. crude traded between $60.75 and $63.09, its highest since Feb. 7.  Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose 97 cents to settle up about 1.5 percent at $66.39 a barrel. It hit a two-week peak at $66.56. U.S. crude inventories USOILC=ECI unexpectedly fell 1.6 million barrels last week as net imports dropped to a record low and exports surged, while inventories declined further at the key storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Crude inventories had been forecast to rise 1.8 million barrels, as stocks seasonally increase when refineries cut intake to conduct maintenance. “Weekly EIA data was particularly supportive to WTI considering U.S. and Cushing draws, a boost in crude exports above 2 million bpd and flat crude production,” said Anthony Headrick, energy market analyst at CHS Hedging LLC in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. futures USOICC=ECI fell 2.7 million barrels last week, the ninth straight week of drawdowns, the EIA said. “The reason that the inventories continue to drop at Cushing is because the market remains backwardated and therefore it’s uneconomical to be storing crude,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston, Texas.  In a market structure called backwardation, prompt crude prices are higher than forward prices, discouraging storage. “It makes more sense to liquidate your on-hand inventories,” Lipow said. U.S. net crude imports USOICI=ECI fell 1.6 million barrels per day to just below 5 million bpd last week, the lowest level since the EIA started recording the data in 2001.  Exports of U.S. crude jumped to just above 2 million bpd, close to a record 2.1 million hit in October. That helped push net imports to the lowest level on record. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP), the largest privately owned crude terminal in the United States, completed the first very large crude carrier (VLCC) crude oil loading operation at its deepwater port, the company said on Sunday. The supertankers can ship about 2 million barrels of oil. Oil prices were also supported as the dollar .DXY declined from an eight-day peak. A weaker dollar makes oil and other dollar-denominated commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies. The correlation between moves in the oil price and the dollar has strengthened in recent weeks, as investors increasingly sell other assets to buy the U.S. currency on expectations of a faster pace of rate rises.

2018-02-22,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will stage more than 5,000 shows, festivals and concerts in 2018, double the number of last year, as it tries to shake off its conservative image in a drive to keep tourist dollars at home and lure in visitors. The state wants to capture up to a quarter of the $20 billion currently spent overseas every year by Saudis seeking entertainment, lifting a ban on cinemas and putting on shows by Western artists. U.S. rapper Nelly performed in Jeddah in December, albeit to a men-only crowd, and Greek musician Yanni played to a mixed-gender audience.  The gradual relaxing of gender segregation risks causing a backlash from religious conservatives, but public objections to a wider programme of reforms have been more muted in recent months after several critics were arrested. At an event to launch the 2018 entertainment calendar, Ahmed al-Khatib, chairman of the state-run General Entertainment Authority (GEA), said infrastructure investments over the next decade would reach 240 billion riyals ($64 billion), including an opera house to be completed around 2022. That will contribute 18 billion riyals to annual GDP and generate 224,000 new jobs by 2030, the GEA said. “The bridge is starting to reverse,” Khatib said, referring to the causeway linking Saudi Arabia with more liberal Bahrain where many Saudis flock for weekend getaways. “And I promise you that we will reverse this migration, and people from Dubai, Kuwait and Bahrain will come to Saudi.” However, on Thursday night, the Minister of Culture and Information said Khatib’s opera plans were an infringement of the role of the General Authority for Culture, a separate government body, the Saudi Press Agency said. The entertainment plans are largely motivated by economics, part of a reform programme to diversify the economy away from oil and create jobs for young Saudis. The Vision 2030 plan aims to increase household spending on cultural and entertainment events inside the kingdom to 6 percent by 2030 from 2.9 percent. “We are bringing the most exciting and famous events to Saudi Arabia this year,” Khatib told Reuters in an interview, adding that state-sponsored entertainment events would be staged in 56 cities. “We are creating new local events with local content,” he said. “Almost 80 percent of the calendar (events) are for families.” Saudi Arabia lifted a 35-year ban on cinemas late last year, with plans for regional and global chains to open more than 300 movie theatres by 2030. The first cinemas are expected to start showing films from March. Last year, the country announced plans to develop resorts on some 50 islands off the Red Sea coast and an entertainment city south of Riyadh featuring golf courses, car racing tracks and a Six Flags theme park.

2018-02-22,"JOHANNESBURG, Feb 22 (Reuters) - South African power producer Eskom said on Thursday the Optimum coal mine, which is owned by the Gupta family and supplies one of the utility’s power stations, had started business rescue proceedings. Ajay Gupta, one of the three Gupta brothers accused of corrupt links to former president Jacob Zuma, was declared a “fugitive from justice” last week by South Africa’s chief prosecutor, while India’s Bank of Baroda, which counts the family’s operations as clients, has pulled the plug on its South African business. South Africa’s main commercial banks have cut all ties with the Guptas, citing reputational risk. Zuma and the Guptas have consistently denied any wrong-doing. Eskom, the sole power provider in Africa’s most industrialised economy, said it was informed by Optimum, which supplies its Hendrina Power Station, that Optimum had started business rescue proceedings on Monday. It did not say what the rescue proceedings entailed. Optimum could not immediately be reached for comment. Eskom said coal had been diverted from other mines to supply the power station after workers at Optimum downed tools and coal was not delivered. Hundreds of members of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) marched on Wednesday at the Optimum mine to express their concerns about the operation’s viability.

2018-02-22,"OSLO (Reuters) - Coral reefs could start to dissolve before 2100 as man-made climate change drives acidification of the oceans, scientists said on Thursday. Acidification will threaten sediments that are building blocks for reefs. Corals already face risks from ocean temperatures, pollution and overfishing. “Coral reefs will transition to net dissolving before end of century,” the Australian-led team of scientists wrote in the U.S. journal Science. “Net dissolving” means reefs would lose more material than they gain from the growth of corals. Carbon dioxide, the main man-made greenhouse gas, forms a weak acid in water and threatens to dissolve the reef sediments, made from broken down bits of corals and other carbonate organisms that accumulate over thousands of years, it said. The sediments are 10 times more vulnerable to acidification than the tiny coral animals that also extract chemicals directly from the sea water to build stony skeletons that form reefs, the study said. Coral animals will be able to keep growing and replenish reefs long after sandy sediments start to dissolve, lead author Bradley Eyre, of Southern Cross University, told Reuters. “This probably reflects the corals’ ability to modify their environment and partially adapt to ocean acidification whereas the dissolution of sands is a geo-chemical process that cannot adapt,” he wrote in an e-mail. The report said it was “unknown if the whole reef will erode once the sediments become net dissolving” and whether reefs “will experience catastrophic destruction” or merely a slow erosion. Some reef sediments were already starting to dissolve, such as at Kaneohe Bay in Hawaii, where other pollutants were contributing.  Eyre said it was unclear if the dissolution of sediments could be a long-term threat to entire islands, from the Pacific to the Caribbean. Other studies say that deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions can limit acidification. Most studies show that acidification will be overwhelmingly bad for ocean life, also threatening creatures such as oysters, lobsters and crabs. Another study on Thursday, however, found that it might help the growth of some plants. “An increase of carbon dioxide in the ocean theoretically could stimulate higher growth of kelp and seaweeds,” Kasper Hancke, a biologist at the Norwegian Institute for Water Research, wrote in a statement.

2018-02-22,"LEIPZIG, Germany (Reuters) - A German court has delayed a ruling on whether major cities can ban heavily polluting diesel cars, which could hit the resale value of up to 15 million vehicles in Europe’s largest car market and force automakers to pay for costly modifications. Judge Andreas Korbmacher said on Thursday the country’s highest federal administrative court would rule on Feb. 27 on an appeal brought by German states against bans imposed by local courts in Stuttgart and Duesseldorf over poor air quality. “We still see a considerable need for guidance,” he said before breaking off the Leipzig court hearing, responding to a question on whether the European Court of Justice (ECJ) may have to be consulted on the matter. The ECJ was not immediately available for comment. European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said on Thursday the Commission was not in charge of traffic regulations in cities. “We don’t view this as a case when we have community competence or we have something meaningful to offer.” There has been a global backlash against diesel-engine cars since Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. exhaust tests, meant to limit emissions of particulate matter and nitrogen oxide (NOx), known to cause respiratory disease. While other countries are also considering restrictions on diesel cars, bans in the birthplace of the modern automobile would be a new blow for the car industry, and an embarrassment for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government, which has backed it. The Leipzig court is due to rule on whether bans imposed by local courts are legal after environmental group DUH sued city authorities. The DUH is also seeking bans in other German cities.  “Everything is still open, but we are much more optimistic,” DUH chief Juerger Resch said after Thursday’s proceedings, noting the judge had made clear that European pollution limits were non-negotiable and must be complied with quickly. “We are convinced that the court will make its own decision. And we also want a national decision.” Germany has long promoted diesel to help cut carbon dioxide emissions and meet climate change goals, but the Volkswagen (VW) scandal has pushed its carmakers to step up spending on electric cars, as well as investments into making diesel engines cleaner. During proceedings in Leipzig on Thursday, lawyers discussed whether the government would have to introduce a new way of labelling cars to enable authorities to enforce any bans. Merkel’s government, which has come under fire for its close ties to the car industry, has lobbied against bans, fearing they could anger millions of drivers and disrupt traffic in cities, with public transport not in a position to take up the slack. Meanwhile, authorities in Paris, Madrid, Mexico City and Athens have said they plan to ban diesel vehicles from city centres by 2025, while the mayor of Copenhagen wants to ban new diesel cars from entering the city as soon as next year. A small group of protesters from Greenpeace gathered outside the Leipzig court, with images of lungs painted on their chests and holding up signs reading “Clean Air Now”. “Because the government has failed to do anything for years about exhaust problems in the cities, judges have to decide today how residents will be protected from bad air,” said Greenpeace transport spokesman Benjamin Stephan. Air quality has been a broader issue in the European Union, leading to a meeting last month between Environment Commissioner Karmenu Vella and representatives of nine countries that face legal action over the problem, including Germany and France. A spokesman for the Commission said on Thursday the countries had submitted additional information and the Commission would come back to the matter in mid-March. The threat of bans has prompted a big fall in sales of diesel cars in Germany, down to just a third of new car sales in January from almost half before the VW scandal. “Diesel might get its final kiss of death (from the court ruling),” Evercore ISI analysts wrote in a note to clients. In an attempt to avert bans, Merkel’s government agreed a deal with carmakers last year to overhaul engine management software on 5.3 million diesel cars as well as funding for cities to help cut emissions by taxis and buses. Environmental groups have called software updates insufficient and have lobbied for cars applying the latest Euro-6 and older Euro-5 emissions standards to have their exhaust treatment systems upgraded. Evercore ISI has said it could cost up to 14.5 billion euros ($17.8 billion) to retrofit Germany’s Euro-5 diesel fleet, and as much as double that if the entire diesel fleet is affected.

2018-02-22,"(Adds stock move, swing to profit) NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Energy Transfer Partners LP is considering constructing a new crude oil pipeline from the Permian basin in Texas to Nederland, Texas, a company executive said on a fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday. The company said it was “aggressively pursuing a larger project” without giving specific details. “We’re listening to our customers and we’re going to build whatever capacity is warranted after those discussions,” Thomas Long, chief financial officer said. Shale producers have flocked to the Permian because of its prolific resources and relatively cheap production costs, boosting demand for takeaway capacity. Production in the Permian is expected to rise by 75,000 barrels per day to 3 million bpd in March. Energy Transfer Partners also said it brought Phase 1 of its 100,000 bpd Permian Express 3 pipeline online in the fourth quarter, with additional volumes expected to come online later this year. The company said it is evaluating an additional 200,000 bpd  expansion on the line that flows from the Permian to Nederland. On its the 30-inch (76-cm) segment of its Bayou Bridge crude pipeline from Nederland to Lake Charles, Louisiana, the company said it transported an average of 145,000 bpd in the fourth quarter. On the 24-inch segment of Bayou Bridge from Lake Charles to St. James, Louisiana, construction was now underway and commercial operations were expected to begin in the second half of 2018, Energy Transfer Partners said. Energy Transfer Partners has suffered construction delays and court challenges to several projects, including the Bayou Bridge line, its Dakota Access crude pipeline and Rover natural gas line, which recently restarted construction in Ohio after regulators halted work following a drilling fluids spill. The company said on Thursday Phase 1 of Rover pipeline, the biggest natural gas pipeline under construction in the United States, is now capable of transporting more than 1.7 billion cubic feet (bcf) per day of natural gas from Cadiz, Ohio, to Defiance, Ohio. “Today, we are more than 99 percent complete with construction for the full project,” a company executive said on the earnings call with analysts. Full completion of the 3.25 bcf per day project is expected in the second quarter of this year. Late on Wednesday, the company reported a net profit of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter compared with a net loss of $336 million a year earlier. Shares of Energy Transfer Partners surged nearly 6 percent to a high of $19.32 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.

2018-02-22,"* EDF says safety of reactor not affected * Weldings designed to be unbreakable are substandard * Regulator ASN studying technical files about the flaws (Adds nuclear regulator’s comments) By Geert De Clercq PARIS, Feb 22 (Reuters) - French state-controlled power group EDF said some weldings on its new Flamanville nuclear reactor did not meet required specifications but this did not affect safety or the schedule to load it with fuel at the end of 2018. France relies on nuclear reactors run by EDF for three-quarters of its electricity. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that EDF would discuss the situation with the residents of Flamanville, northern France, on Thursday. An EDF spokeswoman said 38 of 66 weldings on the Flamanville EPR reactor’s secondary cooling circuit were not in line with standards aimed at making them rupture-proof. But they did meet requirements from French nuclear regulator ASN for nuclear equipment under pressure, she said. ASN chief Pierre-Franck Chevet who has repeatedly said the start-up schedule for the reactor was tight, told a parliament committee hearing on nuclear safety and security on Thursday that an inspection had revealed that the welding issue was more serious than initially thought. Chevet said the issue was still very much open and the agency was far from drawing conclusions because it was still at the start of its analysis of the issue. “That given, I cannot confirm EDF’s assertion that there would not be an impact on Flamanville’s schedule,” Chevet said. “The start-up of Flamanville is subject to my authorisation and the safety calendar will be paramount,” he added. The EPR reactor, the type of unit EDF is also building at Britain’s Hinkley Point, is years behind schedule and billions of euros over budget. The Flamanville reactor is scheduled to be loaded with fuel by the end of December and will ramp up throughout 2019 with a target to be at full power by the fourth quarter of next year. EDF said in a statement on the Flamanville EPR reactor’s website that deviations had been detected in the quality of the weldings in pipes transferring steam from the steam generator to the power turbine. “EDF has started analysis aimed at proving that the mechanical characteristics of the circuit are in line with expectations, within deadlines compatible with the project planning,” it said. The problem was first identified in the workshops of third-party suppliers to Framatome, formerly called Areva, in 2015 and 2017, as well as in weldings on site. Those steel pipes have been designed and manufactured to be 100 percent guaranteed against any rupture or leaks under EDF “high quality” standards that go beyond regulatory requirements. EDF said those requirements had not been properly communicated to suppliers, raising questions about their quality. EDF informed ASN about the problem in early 2017 and sent it technical dossiers to prove the equipment was fit for service and in line with regulations. ASN ruled in June 2017 that Flamanville was fit for service despite weak spots in its steel but ordered EDF to replace the reactor cover by 2024 at the latest due to carbon concentrations in its cover, which make the steel brittle. EDF shares were down 1.6 percent at close.

2018-02-22,"(Recasts with detail, quotes from senior diplomat) By Francois Murphy VIENNA, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Iran has fired a diplomatic warning shot at Washington by raising the prospect of building nuclear reactors for ships while staying within the limits set by its atomic deal with major powers, a U.N. nuclear watchdog report showed on Thursday. U.S. President Donald Trump has long railed against the 2015 nuclear deal for reasons including its limited duration and the fact it does not cover Iran’s ballistic missile programme. He has threatened to pull out unless European allies help “fix” the agreement with a follow-up accord. Since Trump took office more than a year ago, Iran has stayed within limits on items including its stock of low-enriched uranium imposed by the deal, which also lifted painful international economic sanctions against the Islamic Republic. A quarterly report on Iran by the U.N. nuclear watchdog, which is policing the deal’s restrictions, showed that Iran remained compliant, but also that it had informed the agency of a “decision that has been taken to construct naval nuclear propulsion in future”. Iran has raised that prospect in public statements before. In 2016, President Hassan Rouhani ordered the start of planning on the development of nuclear marine propulsion in reaction to what he called U.S. violations of the nuclear deal. Rouhani was alluding to the lack of economic benefit to Iran from the deal because many companies including big Western banks continue to shun the country for fear of breaching separate U.S. financial sanctions that stayed in place after other sanctions were rescinded. Analysts have said Iran is many years or decades away from having naval nuclear capacity. But mentioning it evokes both projecting military might and potentially enriching uranium beyond the limit of 3.67 percent purity imposed by the deal. A senior diplomat said it was not clear from Iran’s statement to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) whether it was referring to those previous statements, but they appeared to be a reaction to Trump’s comments. “Formally there is no clarity on this. But informally yes, why now? So obviously there is a link ... to the possibility that the JCPOA’s future is questioned,” the senior diplomat said, referring to the 2015 deal by its full name, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Iran’s notification on marine propulsion could cover a range of intentions over any period of time, meaning there was no cause for concern, the senior diplomat said. Iran has yet to respond to the IAEA’s request for “further clarifications and amplifications”, the report said, adding that if Iran had reached a concrete decision to build new facilities for marine propulsion it must provide design information. The confidential quarterly IAEA report follows a statement by Iran’s deputy foreign minister earlier on Thursday that Tehran will withdraw from the deal if there is no economic gains and major banks continue to stay away.

Oil prices also rose as the U.S. dollar hit session lows in morning trading after having touched a 10-day high, as the euro was boosted by minutes from the European Central Bank’s most recent policy meeting. Comments from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard on Thursday appeared to ease some investor concerns about the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting. Minutes from that meeting, released Wednesday, showed policymakers were more confident about the need to keep raising U.S. interest rates, with most believing inflation would climb. But Bullard told CNBC on Thursday that central bankers need to be careful not to increase rates too quickly this year because that could slow the economy. “Bullard made a comment on rates. That’s what has given the market a reason to see a little bit of a positive futures,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth in New York. Benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year yields <US10YT=RR > slipped from their four-year high hit in the previous session. The notes last rose 7/32 in price to yield 2.917 percent, from 2.941 percent late on Wednesday. Bond prices, which usually move inversely to yields, firmed ahead of a U.S. government auction of new seven-year notes, the final sale of $258 billion in debt this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 293.47 points, or 1.18 percent, to 25,091.25, the S&P 500 gained 25.27 points, or 0.94 percent, to 2,726.6 and the Nasdaq Composite added 55.51 points, or 0.77 percent, to 7,273.74. MSCI’s gauge of stock markets across the globe gained 0.36 percent. European shares, however, seemed to follow Asia lower. A flurry of corporate results failed to lift sentiment after speculation about U.S. interest rates soured risk appetite globally. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.10 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.73 percent lower, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.07 percent. The latest minutes from the ECB showed it retaining its dovish stance and said even changes in communication would be “premature.” In Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, data showed business confidence fell more than expected in February. Though Germany is set for solid growth in the first quarter, diverging monetary policy expectations with the United States sent the “transatlantic spread” between German and U.S. 10-year borrowing costs to 222 bps, the highest in more than a year. The U.S. dollar slipped against a basket of major currencies as a rally from a three-year low last week ran out of steam, and heightened volatility led investors to favor the Japanese yen, considered a safe haven currency, sending it up. The dollar index fell 0.16 percent, with the euro up 0.28 percent to $1.2316. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.70 percent versus the greenback at 107.04 per dollar. Oil extended gains on a surprise draw in U.S. crude inventories and the weaker dollar. U.S. crude rose 1.56 percent to $62.64 per barrel and Brent was last at $66.16, up 1.13 percent on the day.

2018-02-22,"(Adds comment, background on exports) By Devika  Krishna Kumar Feb 22 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil stockpiles fell unexpectedly last week as net imports dropped to a record low due to a surge in exports, while inventories at the key storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma continued to slide, the Energy Information Administration said on Thursday. Crude inventories fell 1.6 million barrels in the week to Feb. 16, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 1.8 million barrels. Net crude imports fell last week by 1.6 million barrels per day to 4.98 million bpd, the lowest level since the EIA started recording the data in 2001. Exports of U.S. crude jumped to just above 2 million bpd, close to a record high of 2.1 million hit in October. That helped to push net imports to the lowest level on record. “Even though refinery runs dropped below 16 million barrels per day for the first time since the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, lower net imports have resulted in a draw,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at Clipperdata. “The big jump in crude exports appears to have been because the EIA included the first export cargo from LOOP in last week’s number,” he said. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP), the largest privately-owned crude terminal in the United States, has completed the first very large crude carrier (VLCC) crude oil loading operation at its deepwater port, the company said on Sunday. The supertankers can ship about 2 million barrels of oil. Washington lifted a 40-year ban on oil exports in 2015, and since then tankers filled with U.S. crude have landed in more than 30 countries. Oil prices rose after the data, with U.S. crude futures jumping more than $1 to a two-week high at $62.85 a barrel. “It was a trifecta for the bulls with imports down, Cushing inventories continuing to slide lower and exports of crude soaring to over 2 million barrels per day,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub , the delivery point for U.S. futures, fell by 2.7 million barrels, the ninth straight week of declines, the EIA said. The combination of a new pipeline running from the hub to Memphis, along with reduced flows from TransCanada’s Keystone pipeline, has more than halved supplies at Cushing since November. Refinery utilization rates fell by 1.7 percentage points to 88.1 percent of total capacity as plant maintenance ramped up ahead of the high-demand summer season. Refinery crude runs fell by 329,000 bpd to 15.8 million bpd, EIA data showed. Gasoline stocks rose 261,000 barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 283,000-barrel decline. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 2.4 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.5 million-barrel drop, the EIA data showed.

2018-02-22,"GEORGETOWN, Feb 22 (Reuters) - In an attempt to thwart “incursion and invasion,” Guyana set up two army bases this week on its jungle frontier with ailing Venezuela, following similar moves by larger neighbors Colombia and Brazil. Venezuelan soldiers are entering Guyanese territory in search of food, while civilians are seeking medical attention and selling drugs and whatever else they can, according to authorities in the tiny former British colony on the northeastern shoulder of South America. Brazil and Colombia tightened their borders with Venezuela early this month, as they grapple with a mounting influx of hundreds of thousands of desperate migrants fleeing a worsening economic and social crisis. Colombia imposed stricter migratory controls and deployed security personnel while Brazil deployed more troops and started relocating tens of thousands of Venezuelan refugees. Guyana’s 500-mile (800-km) border with Venezuela is mostly impenetrable jungle. Venezuela claims some two-thirds of Guyana, a dispute recently revived after an oil discovery off Guyana’s shores. President David Granger visited the border village of Kaikan on Wednesday saying it was a “front line” against any attempts at incursion and invasion. “Frontier communities are guardians of Guyana’s territorial integrity and national security. They are our first line of defense,” said Granger in the small indigenous village. The army bases were set up in regions close to the border where residents have complained of “terrorizing encounters” with a notorious gang from Venezuela known as the Syndicatos, the government said in a statement. One is in Kaikan and another was set up last week in Whitewater, another village, after the Warrau people there reported a large influx of Venezuelans, including military personnel, seeking medical services and trading. “They come in metal boats and they bring whatever they have to sell - everything from fruits and vegetables to live cattle and plucked chicken,” said Brentnol Ashley, the chairman for Barima-Waini, one of the regions closest to the border, said in an interview. “In Whitewater, we found Venezuelan soldiers in Guyanese territory in search of food.” Venezuela is undergoing a major economic and social crisis. The minimum wage has fallen in value to the equivalent of a dollar or two per month amid soaring hyperinflation and shortages of basic goods. President Nicolas Maduro is seeking re-election on April 22 and is likely to win it given that the country’s opposition has boycotted the vote, describing it as fraudulent and illegitimate. Venezuelan authorities did not respond to a request for comment.

2018-02-22,"(Reuters) - Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) said it expects production to keep rising this year, despite a 12 percent cut in spending, sending the U.S. natural gas producer’s shares up nearly 23 percent on Thursday. Like its peers in the energy industry, Chesapeake faces pressure from investors to increase production on minimal spending, and has cut costs and jobs to manage a balance sheet saddled with nearly $10 billion in debt. The company, which is selling assets worth $2 billion to $3 billion, said it expects production to rise by about 3 percent in 2018 after adjusting for asset sales. While that growth rate is the same as last year, it will come off a planned capital budget of $1.96 billion to $2.38 billion for 2018, which at the mid-point is 12 percent lower than last year. The Street should “perceive this as a positive given 2018 spending is decreasing, while production still increasing,” SunTrust Robinson analyst Neal Dingmann said. Since crude oil prices crashed in 2014, U.S. energy producers have been curbing costs, while aiming to boost output through new technology such as processing seismic data better, improving reservoir models and drilling more efficient wells. Chesapeake said it expects new wells to be “a lot more economic” as it tests new well designs. “We will continue to drive costs out of our operations, improve margins and utilize advancing technologies to create value across our portfolio,” Chief Executive Officer Robert Lawler said on a conference call. Chesapeake is focusing on the Powder River Basin across Montana and Wyoming to tap gas reserves. It also operates in the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas, Utica Shale in Ohio and Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma. Higher production and averaged realized prices, and a near 9 percent drop in costs, helped Chesapeake’s fourth-quarter profit top analysts’ expectations.

2018-02-22,"PRAGUE/SOFIA (Reuters) - CEZ (CEZP.PR) has approved the sale of its remaining assets in Bulgaria to Inercom Bulgaria and expects to sign a contract on the deal in a few days, the Czech electricity producer said on Thursday. CEZ’s supervisory board has given its approval for sale of an energy distributor that provides electricity to over 3 million people in northwestern Bulgaria, an energy trader and several renewable energy assets. CEZ did not disclose the value of the deal, but a source familiar with the process estimated the transaction at about  300 million euros ($370 million). Bulgarian business online publication Capital put the deal at 320 million euros. “Inercom’s offer is significantly above the fair market value of the assets sold, as determined in an independent appraisal, and brings a positive return on the investments in the Bulgarian assets” CEZ said in a statement. Inercom Bulgaria, part of a group that operates six photovoltaic energy installations with an installed capacity of 23 megawatts and is active in the construction sector, declined to comment. The deal is pending the approval of Bulgaria’s anti-trust authority.  Speaking at a parliamentary energy commission prior to the announcement, Energy Minister Temenuzhka Petkova said the deal should also get the nod of the financial and the energy regulators, as CEZ controlled significant energy assets. “What is important to us is that security of supplies and quality of services be guaranteed,” Petkova said.  A source familiar with the process said Inercom was holding talks with an international bank to partially finance the deal. Capital said the small company planned to secure half of the funds needed with a credit from two other unidentified companies. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development which arranged a 116 million euros syndicated loan to CEZ Bulgaria in 2016, has the right to call the loan as result of the change of ownership and is yet to decide how to proceed.  CEZ, which started the process of offloading its Bulgarian assets last January, said the sale would not affect its ongoing international arbitration with Bulgaria. The Czech company has already agreed the sale of its Varna power plant in Bulgaria to Bulgaria’s SIGDA OOD.

2018-02-22,"LONDON (Reuters) - Kazakh mining company Eurasian Resources Group (ERG), formerly known as ENRC, is working on a plan to eventually spin off and list some of its assets to help repay debt, three banking sources said. The company, then called Eurasian National Resources Corporation (ENRC), was taken private by its three founders and the Kazakh government in 2013 in a $4.5 billion (3.23 billion pounds) buyout, six years after listing on the London stock exchange. While listed in London, the company was dogged by boardroom battles, weak commodity prices and an investigation into fraud and bribery at some of its subsidiaries. ERG, which is registered in Luxembourg, has ferrochrome, aluminium, iron ore and energy operations in Kazakhstan, copper and cobalt assets in Africa and iron ore mines in Brazil. The assets sales will help ERG pay off some of its debt, the sources said. VTB agreed last year to extend the terms covering $3 billion of ERG’s debt to 2022. As of July 2016, ERG owed $5.8 billion to its main creditors, VTB (VTBR.MM) and Sberbank (SBER.MM). “The company needs to raise cash and is looking to spin off some of its assets, most likely the ferrochrome and power ones, and list them,” another banking source said. The sources said VTB Capital and Rothschild (ROTH.PA) were working on the plan. ERG was not immediately available to comment. VTB Capital and Rothschild, which is a long-term adviser to the Kazakh government, declined to comment. The government holds a 40 percent stake in the company. One of the banking sources said ERG was looking to bring in Japanese or Chinese shareholders to invest in a stake of up to 20 percent in the assets it plans to spin off. Documentation will be sent to potential investors over the next few weeks, the source said. Sources said ERG would probably aim to list the spun-off assets in London or Hong Kong, which would be a turnaround after it quit the FTSE 100 index .FTSE under a cloud. Britain’s Serious Fraud Office launched an investigation into ENRC in 2013, the year it became ERG following the buyout. The company denies it committed any criminal offence and none of its employees or consultants has been charged or prosecuted. The company raised 1.4 billion pounds ($2 billion) when it listed in London in 2007 but its shares fell 60 percent during its six-year listing, according to Thomson Reuters data. Minority shareholders were left with heavy losses and the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority changed its rules after ENRC quit the exchange to make majority shareholders more accountable. ERG has sold assets worth about $1 billion in the past few years and is developing large-scale investment projects worth more than $2 billion with China as part of Beijing’s “Belt and Road” initiative, a project to build a modern-day Silk Road trading route extending to Europe, southern Asia and Africa. Kazakhstan, Central Asia’s biggest economy, has also started an ambitious privatisation programme after being hard hit by the slide in world oil prices since 2014. The country’s $67 billion sovereign wealth fund Samruk Kazyna has sold more than 120 small and mid-sized firms. It is also preparing to privatise larger firms such as oil producers KazMunayGaz (KMG) KMGZ.KZ and Samruk Energy, uranium producer Kazatomprom and national carrier Air Astana. In a bid to build commercial ties with Chinese businesses and gain access to Chinese investors, some of the state-owned firms are expected to list in Hong Kong as well as Astana when they are privatised, industry sources said.

2018-02-22,"VIENNA, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Staunchly anti-nuclear Austria has filed a legal challenge at the European Court of Justice against the European Commission over its approval of Hungary’s plans to expand an atomic power plant. Austria’s new government, an alliance between Chancellor Sebastian Kurz’s conservatives and the far-right Freedom Party, has pledged to continue Vienna’s decades-long policy of opposing nuclear power. It said last month that it would file the legal challenge against the expansion of the Paks power plant situated near the border it shares with Hungary. “We must take up this David-versus-Goliath struggle for the sake of our nature, our environment and our unique countryside,” the minister for sustainability and tourism, Elisabeth Koestinger, said in a statement on Thursday announcing the government had started the case. “Nuclear energy has no place in Europe. We will not deviate from this line by even a centimetre.” A spokesman for the EU executive said: “The Commission will defend its decision in Court.” In March, EU state aid regulators approved Hungary’s plan to build two new reactors at its Paks nuclear site with the help of Russia’s Rosatom, saying Hungarian authorities had agreed to several measures to ensure fair competition. The two new reactors will double the plant’s nominal capacity of 2,000 megawatts. Hungary aims to start construction on the reactors this year, with the first facility expected due to be completed in 2025. In most complex cases of this kind, the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice has found in favour of the Commission.

2018-02-22,"BRASILIA, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Brazil’s lower house of Congress will vote in April on legislation to privatize state-controlled power holding company Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, Speaker Rodrigo Maia said on Thursday. Maia told reporters that approval of the sale of Latin America’s largest utility, known as Eletrobras, should be voted on in committee by mid-April and by the full house in the following two weeks. Maia said he will fast-track a bill to abolish payroll tax breaks granted to businesses by the previous government, and it should be put to a vote within two weeks. President Michel Temer’s government is counting on the approval of both bills to meet its fiscal target this year. The collapse of its efforts to push through an overhaul of the costly social security system has raised doubts about Brazil’s ability to bring its budget deficit under control and stop its massive public debt from snowballing. Sources in Temer’s economic team told Reuters this week that the government might have to give up on other issues, referring to 15 policies it wants to enact after failing to win enough backing for the unpopular pension reform bill. They range from closing tax breaks to strengthening the central bank’s autonomy and giving regulatory agencies more muscle, a set of policies designed to reassure investors that the government’s reform program is still on track. Privatization of Eletrobras, as the company is known, faces open resistance in Congress. The government hopes to raise 12.2 billion reais from the process. The proposal to end payroll tax breaks to improve revenue has been stuck in Congress for months. Maia said the lower house will continue to work on approval of austerity measures to keep Brazil’s fiscal adjustment on track. But he said lawmakers will not accept any new taxes. Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles said on Wednesday that Brazil will have to raise taxes if it does not streamline a generous but costly pension system that has been the main driver of the government’s budget deficits for the last three years.

2018-02-22,"PRAGUE, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Czech energy investor Pavel Tykac has set up Seven Energy holding company to invest more than 1 billion euros mainly in European power plants fired by fossil fuels, even as many utilities shift their focus to renewables. The strategy mirrors that of Czech energy firm EPH, which has profited from buying up older plants in Germany, Britain, Italy and elsewhere in recent years. Tykac, who owns the Chvaletice power plant and coal mines in the Czech Republic, failed in his first bid to expand in power markets two years ago when he lost to EPH in a tender to buy lignite plants in Germany. Seven Energy said in a statement it would be led by former managers from majority state-owned Czech utility giant CEZ , including former board member Alan Svoboda and former trading head Michal Skalka. “We are interested in all acquisitions where we can add some value. We want to remain in energy, mainly the conventional energy where we have strong know-how,” Svoboda said. Tykac has been active in Czech energy markets for more than a decade and is one of the richest business executive in the central European country. “We believe the end of conventional (energy) sources is unavoidable.

2018-02-22,"* EBITDA, adjusted for oil inventory holdings, at 170 mln euros * Figure within the range of analysts forecasts * Will pay a dividend of 0.40 euros a share, for 2017 (Adds detail) ATHENS, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Hellenic Petroleum, Greece’s biggest oil refiner, on Thursday reported a 21 percent drop in fourth-quarter core profit due to weaker refining margins. The refiner said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), adjusted for oil inventory holdings, came in at 170 million euros ($210 million), down from 215 million euros in the same period a year earlier. The figure was within the range of analysts forecasts in a Reuters poll. Weaker margins and increased oil prices, along with euro strength against the dollar, weighed on profits. Hellenic, which exports about half of its output, will pay a dividend of 0.40 euro a share, up from 0.20 euro last year. Refining sales volume increased by 7 percent to 4 million tonnes thanks to the smooth operation of refineries. Hellenic is selling its 35 percent stake in gas grid operator DESFA and Greece is divesting another 31 percent from its holding under the country’s multibillion international bailout, which ends in August. A consortium of Italy’s Snam, Spain’s Enagas Internacional and Belgium’s Fluxys, and a consortium of Spain’s Regasificadora del Noroeste (Reganosa), Romania’s Transgaz and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), submitted binding bids for the stake last week. Hellenic said it expected the preferred bidder would be named by the end of the first quarter. A joint venture of Hellenic with Total and Edison has signed a lease agreement with the government to search for oil and gas in the Ionian Sea. The refiner said it expected the Greek parliament would ratify the lease agreement in the next few days, so initial exploration works could start immediately after. Its shares trade at 8.7-times its 12-month forward earnings, compared with 17 times for rivals Neste and 11 times for Saras.

2018-02-22,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Novatek (NVTK.MM) is interested in Saudi Aramco joining the Arctic LNG-2 plant as a partner, the Russian gas producer’s head Leonid Mikhelson said on Thursday, highlighting growing ties between Russia and Saudi Arabia.  Both countries have been instrumental in implementing a global pact on cutting oil production by almost 1.8 million barrels per day. Novatek and its partners started producing liquefied natural gas at the Yamal LNG project last year. Novatek is headed by Mikhelson, who is ranked as Russia’s wealthiest man according to the Russian edition of Forbes.  It also plans to launch its second LNG project in the nearby Gydan peninsula in 2022-2023. Novatek, Russia’s largest non-state natural gas producer,  and Saudi Aramco signed a memorandum on cooperation last week, without disclosing details “We are interested in Saudi Aramco to become our partner in Arctic LNG-2 project,” Mikhelson told a conference call with investors. Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the time of Yamal LNG launch in December, that Russia would like to sell its gas to Saudi Arabia. Mikhelson also said that Novatek plans to finance the new project mostly via its shareholders, with 45 percent of total financing expected to be via equity and 55 percent could be raised by external debt. Investments in the $27 billion Yamal LNG project were put at risk after Novatek came under Western sanctions over Moscow’s role in the Ukraine crisis. But it found other financing sources.

2018-02-22,"* Entertainment infrastructure investment to reach $64 bln * Government aims to create 224,000 jobs in sector by 2030 * Part of broad reform to boost economy, improve lifestyles By Sarah Dadouch RIYADH, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will stage more than 5,000 shows, festivals and concerts in 2018, double the number of last year, as it shakes off its conservative image in a drive to keep tourist dollars at home and lure in visitors. The state wants to capture up to a quarter of the $20 billion currently spent overseas by Saudis seeking entertainment abroad, lifting a ban on cinemas and putting on shows by Western artists. U.S. rapper Nelly performed in Jeddah in December, albeit to a men-only crowd, and Greek musician Yanni played to a mixed-gender audience. The gradual relaxing of gender segregation risks a backlash from religious conservatives but public objections to a wider programme of reforms have been more muted in recent months after several critics were arrested. At an event to launch the 2018 entertainment calendar, Ahmed al-Khatib, chairman of the state-run General Entertainment Authority (GEA), said infrastructure investments over the next decade would reach 240 billion riyals ($64 billion), including an opera house to be completed around 2022. That will contribute 18 billion riyals to annual GDP and generate 224,000 new jobs by 2030, the GEA said. “The bridge is starting to reverse,” Khatib said, referring to the causeway linking Saudi Arabia with more liberal Bahrain where many Saudis flock for weekend getaways. “And I promise you that we will reverse this migration, and people from Dubai, Kuwait and Bahrain will come to Saudi.” The entertainment plans are largely motivated by economics, part of a reform programme to diversify the economy from oil and create new sectors to employ young Saudis. The Vision 2030 plan aims to increase household spending on cultural and entertainment events inside the kingdom to 6 percent by 2030 from 2.9 percent. “We are bringing the most exciting and famous events to Saudi Arabia this year,” Khatib told Reuters in an interview, adding that state-sponsored entertainment events would be staged in 56 cities. “We are creating new local events with local content,” he said. “Almost 80 percent of the calendar (events) are for families.” Saudi Arabia lifted a 35-year-old ban on cinemas late last year, with plans for regional and global chains to open more than 300 movie theatres by 2030. The first cinemas are expected to start showing films from March. Last year the country announced plans to develop resorts on some 50 islands off the Red Sea coast and an entertainment city south of Riyadh featuring golf courses, car racing tracks and a Six Flags theme park.

2018-02-22," LONDON (Reuters) - Highly intelligent people may be more rather than less likely to succumb to motivated reasoning, cherry-picking evidence to reinforce their existing beliefs and ignoring contradictory data. Even with people with high numerally skills were unable to reason analytically when the correct answer collided with their political beliefs, according to a forthcoming journal article in “Trends in Cognitive Sciences”. In fact, people with high information-processing skills were the most likely to express beliefs consistent with their political standpoint (“The partisan brain: an identity-based model of political belief” Van Bagel and Pereira, 2018). The authors focus on the role of ideology and political partisanship in the United States, but many of the same arguments about motivated reasoning apply to the energy sector. Many of the most important issues in the energy world, including the impact of OPEC on oil prices, climate change, the transition to clean energy, the future of fossil fuels and electric cars, renewable energy and peak oil, have become intensely emotional. In some cases, the intensity of energy debates has been heightened because it has become conflated with political partisanship. In others, the ferocity of disputes stem from origins that lie outside politics. Views about peaking oil demand, electric cars and OPEC have become an important marker of social identity, and people will cling to them even when presented with contradictory evidence. The problem with motivated reasoning is that it strongly distorts not just policy preferences but the way people process information and even the way they perceive and interpret the same piece of data. The authors blame much of this motivated reasoning on the “tribal nature” of the human mind, which leads people to value dogma over truth. Belief in a particular ideology, whether about politics or an issue in the energy sector, provides an important and satisfying sense of group belonging as well as access to resources and patronage. But when the demands of ideology and group membership clash with the evidence, many individuals will disregard contradictory data rather than modify their thinking or risk losing group approval. “Social identities have been shown to shape the way people interpret information. In turn, interpretations of the world shape political attitudes, judgements and behaviours,” Van Bavel and Pereira write. “Because people believe that they see the world around them objectively, members of other parties who disagree with them are seen as uninformed, irrational or biased.” “Partisan identities bias a broad range of judgements, even when presented with facts that contradict them,” according to the authors. What the authors describe as “our ancient capacity for tribalism”, recognising similar characteristics in others, may originally have served a useful evolutionary purpose. But it can be fatal to a calm and constructive analysis of problems whether they are about high politics or energy issues. Many of the fierce disagreements around future peaks in oil demand and the uptake of electric vehicles, for example, or the impact of OPEC on oil prices, are not really disagreements about technical issues but disputes about values and ideology. Tribalism is what turns so many discussions about energy into an emotive shouting match between opponents who accuse each other of being at best uninformed and incompetent or at worst mendacious. In most cases, energy professionals would be better served by dialling back on the heated rhetoric and exploring the issues more calmly and with an open mind. Unfortunately, much of the analysis in the energy sector comes from individuals and institutions promoting a distinctive viewpoint rather than taking a more data-driven empirical approach. Dispassionate analysis has often become inextricably mixed up with highly motivated lobbying and advocacy, to the severe detriment to the quality of the analysis. In general, individuals and institutions can be good analysts, or good lobbyist/advocates, but not both. Mixing the two is almost always a mistake.  John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

2018-02-22,"LONDON (Reuters) - Indian refiner Essar Oil is looking to raise over $1 billion (719.84 million pounds) from trading houses after its new Russian owners could not raise loans from major Western banks due to sanctions on Russia. Essar wants to borrow the money for 3-4 years and repay it with cargoes of refined products as it seeks to cut its reliance on lending from Indian banks, banking and trading sources familiar with the discussions said. It would be the first large multi-year pre-payment deal by Essar, which has previously engaged only in short-term deals. Russian oil major Rosneft (ROSN.MM), fund UCP and Swiss commodities trader Trafigura bought Essar Oil’s large refinery, 3,500 fuel stations and infrastructure for $12.9 billion last year.  Kremlin-owned Rosneft has been under U.S. sanctions since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. The Essar deal was funded mainly by Russian state banks, including sanction-hit VTB (VTBR.MM), and the new owners’ attempts to partially borrow from large Western banks have so far not progressed. Banks are not technically forbidden from lending to Essar, in which Rosneft owns 49 percent. Sanctions forbid lending to entities majority-owned by Rosneft but banking sources have said they would still exercise caution. “Essar and Rosneft initially signalled interest in borrowing but have gone silent in the past six months after most banks signalled to them they would not be able to lend,” said a source with a major Western bank, which initially received an invitation to express interest. The new shareholders are keen to diversify their financing base away from relying only on Indian banks as had been the case under the Ruia family who were the former owners, one of the banking sources said. A spokesman for Essar Oil declined to comment. Previously, Essar Oil India had credit lines with 26 Indian banks, which complicated the closing of the deal. Using a prepayment was viewed as a easier alternative to widen its cash base.  However, lending to Essar is also complicated by the types of crude it is relying on for its operations - with significant volumes coming from Iran and Venezuela. While the international oil embargo on Iran was lifted in early 2016, U.S. restrictions on dollar use in connection to Iran remain. President Donald Trump has also repeatedly criticised the nuclear pact with Tehran and threatened to stop extending U.S. sanctions relief.  As for Venezuela, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the government has been weighing sanctions on the South American country’s oil industry.  Essar is expected to issue a request-for-proposal early in the second quarter of this year outlining the details of the pre-finance loan, a second banking source said. Traders who loan funds would be repaid with gasoline and gasoil cargoes. Rosneft said last in August last year that Essar Oil planned to double throughput at the refinery and build a petrochemical plant.

2018-02-22,"DETROIT, Feb 22 (Reuters) - A deal Thursday between UPS and U.S. electric van maker Workhorse Group Inc shows how the delivery industry is making progress to resolve a major obstacle to deployment of battery-powered commercial vehicles: Charging costs. UPS, like its rivals in the package delivery business, faces pressure from regulators in major cities around the world to clean up its fleet of petroleum-burning vehicles. UPS is partnering with Workhorse to build an all-new electric delivery van. The first 50 vehicles with a driving range of 100 miles (160 km) will be delivered in 2018. That range is enough to allow UPS to replace around 35,000 diesel or gasoline delivery trucks, company officials said. Until recently, however, UPS would have faced substantial costs for the charging stations and related infrastructure to top up the batteries at the end of the day. “With the large-scale deployments of vehicles, if you can’t put them somewhere to take advantage of them then it’s irrelevant,” Scott Phillippi, UPS senior director for automotive maintenance and engineering for international operations, told Reuters. “We have to have solutions in place to make that happen.” Solutions for the charging problem are now in sight, UPS and other industry officials say. UPS recently rolled out “smart charging” software at a central London facility that allowed the company to nearly triple its local electric fleet to 170 delivery vans. The smart charging technology determines when and how fast to charge vehicles. If vehicles are not scheduled for a full route the next day, the system can opt not to fully charge them and charge other vehicles more. Without the software, UPS would have had to install enough infrastructure to charge all the vehicles at the same time - the equivalent of powering an office building or hospital - at a cost of millions of dollars for electric grid hardware. The project at UPS’s London facility was partly funded by Innovate UK, the British government innovation agency. If successful, UPS will use its London experience as a blueprint around the world as it expands its electric delivery vehicle fleet. UPS’ approach could also serve as a model for smaller companies that cannot afford major infrastructure investments. “If this solution didn’t exist, it would cost too much money for small companies to upgrade their connection capacity,” said Christos Keramisanos, a consultant at UK Power Networks Services (UKPNS) in charge of the UPS project in London. Charging costs are critical as delivery fleet operators calculate the costs of switching to electric vehicles. Hermes, a European delivery service, plans to deploy 1,500 electric Mercedes vans, and is working with Daimler AG’s commercial van unit to design recharging systems that do not require new transformers or large numbers of individual charging stations, said Benjamin Kaehler, head of Mercedes’ electric van business. Mercedes’ goal is to structure charging costs so an electric van has the same total cost of ownership as a petroleum-fueled van over three years, Kaehler told Reuters. Cheaper charging is key to that goal. “That’s the breakthrough,” he said. U.S. truck leasing and rental company Ryder System Inc , which has bought electric vans from Chanje, a unit of China’s FDG Electric Vehicles Ltd, is already training its technical and sales staff on smart charging technology. “Ryder is aware the world is going electric and we are preparing for that future,” said Chris Nordh, Ryder’s director of advanced vehicle technology. “Smart charging is key to creating scale.” Developing the battery plants and charging infrastructure to fund an electrified global vehicle fleet could require an investment of $2.7 trillion by manufacturers and governments - $1.7 trillion in battery plants, manufacturing and chargers, and $1 trillion on distribution and generation capacity, said Balu Balagopal, a partner in A.T. Kearney’s energy practice. His estimate is based on an assumption that 64 percent of the global vehicle fleet is electrified by 2040. Utility regulations are an obstacle. The United States lacks national standards for recovering the costs of electric-vehicle charging infrastructure. For Tesla’s “Semi” big rig - far larger than a delivery van - customers such as PepsiCo Inc, Anheuser-Busch Inbev and UPS plan to build their own charging stations. California has moved to allow utilities to recoup investments and is reviewing proposals from utilities to spend more than $1 billion over five years on electrification infrastructure for cars, buses and trucks. Other states do not allow utilities to spread electric vehicle infrastructure costs across their broad base of ratepayers. “The right structures haven’t been put in place to allow us to operate and participate in this market,” said Lang Reynolds, electric transportation manager at Duke Energy Corp of Charlotte, North Carolina, which serves several southeastern U.S. states.

2018-02-22,"BRUSSELS/WARSAW (Reuters) - The European Union’s top court on Thursday said Poland had failed to uphold air quality standards, part of a wider EU battle to reduce deaths from airborne pollution which it estimates kills 400,000 people every year. Environmentalists have called on Poland to take action to improve air quality, which in some places, especially in the south, can be worse than in Beijing and New Delhi, the world’s most polluted cities. But activists said the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party had been slow in introducing anti-smog regulations and complained to the EU. The issue is one of several disputes straining ties between Warsaw and Brussels. This week the EU’s top court adviser said Poland breached the law with increased logging in its ancient Bialowieza Forest. The European Commission took Poland to court over its slow response in addressing poor air quality caused by extensive coal and rubbish burning in homes. The European Court of Justice ruled limits to regulate the amount of pollutants in the air had been “persistently exceeded.” The air contained too much PM10, particulate matter smaller than 10 micrometers, which can damage health if breathed in. Poland exceeded the daily legal amount of pollutants in 35 of its 46 “air quality zones” and nine of those zones also failed an inspection of the annual legal limit, the court said.  “Fighting smog is one of the government’s priorities. But we will not be able to do it within a year,” Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told a conference after the court ruling. Piotr Wozny, a deputy minister responsible for air quality, blamed former governments for neglecting the problem and announced a pilot program to help 22 of the most polluted towns. The government and local authorities will spend 750 million zlotys ($220 million) to help poorer households make their homes warmer and want to offer subsidies to households to buy more eco-friendly furnaces, the environment minister said. “We would like to agree with the European Commission the conditions of a special operational program for clean air,” Wozny said, adding Poland wanted to end the fight with smog by 2027.  Environmental group ClientEarth said if Poland continued to breach air pollution limits it could face “hefty” fines imposed as a result of another court process. Poland’s Environment Ministry said there was no risk Warsaw would be penalized as a direct consequence of the court’s ruling on Thursday.   Last month, the European Commission warned nine other member states, including Germany and the United Kingdom, that it could take legal action if they did not present “additional credible, timely and effective measures” to tackle air pollutants.  All have submitted information to be evaluated, according to a Commission spokesman. Targets introduced to reduce the amount of pollutants for 2005 and 2010 are being exceeded in 23 of the EU’s 28 members. Bulgaria faced similar charges to Poland in April 2017.

2018-02-22,"* Investors price in more Fed tightening after minutes * Treasury yields ease off highs but world stocks at one-week low * Wall Street set for weaker session (Updates throughout) By Sujata Rao LONDON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - World stocks tumbled to one-week lows on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve confirmed it was on track to raise interest rates several times this year, sending bond yields to multi-year highs. Wall Street was set for its third straight session in the red, equity futures indicated. While U.S. 10-year yields retreated from the 3 percent big figure, minutes of the Fed’s meeting at the end of January have at least temporarily taken the edge off investors’ appetite for equities and other assets perceived as risky, such as emerging markets and commodities.. The minutes showed Fed policymakers agreed at the meeting, held after U.S. lawmakers had approved some $1.5 trillion in tax cuts, that “a gradual upward trajectory of the federal funds rate would be appropriate”. They also noted “upward risks” to economic growth and inflation. As a result, the odds of faster U.S. interest rate hikes have narrowed, with a host of Fed fund futures hitting contract lows. While three rate rises are almost fully priced in for 2018 — up from two in December — some traders now reckon four moves might be possible this year. Some of the impact of the minutes had started to fade however, with the dollar now trading off 10-day highs against a basket of currencies and U.S. Treasury yields edging off four-year highs around 2.96 percent. Marie Owens Thomsen, global head of economic research at Indosuez Wealth Management in Geneva, said markets seemed to have finally accepted a faster rate rise trajectory for 2018. But she saw no reason for an equity market collapse or sharp bond selloff. “When I look at the fundamentals, I see stable growth in all major economies, good earnings from the majority of companies and in a historical context, I see low interest rates and low inflation,” Owens Thomsen said. She was referring to 75 percent of U.S. S&P 500-listed firms which have beaten analysts’ forecasts with their fourth-quarter 2017 results, while in Europe the number stands at more than 53 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Despite the solid earnings, Wall Street closed sharply lower on Wednesday and its losses drove falls of around 1 percent in Asia and Europe  . MSCI’s all-country equity index stayed under pressure, losing 0.4 percent for its third straight day of losses, while emerging equities lost 1 percent. New York was set for another weak session, with S&P futures down around 0.3 percent. The impact of the Fed’s minutes was further tempered by the latest minutes from the European Central Bank, which retained its dovish stance and said even changes in communication would be “premature”. The comments suggest that policymakers will move by increments, keeping one eye on markets to avoid having to backtrack. German 10-year yields did not react to the ECB minutes, though they were well off the 0.75 percent hit after the Fed minutes, tempered by data showing German business confidence fell more than expected in February. While Europe’s biggest economy is clearly set for solid growth in the first quarter of 2018, the diverging monetary policy expectations with the United States sent the “transatlantic spread” between German and U.S. 10-year borrowing costs to 222 bps, the highest in more than a year. The next milestone for markets is new Fed chairman Jerome Powell’s first testimony to Congress, scheduled for Wednesday. What he says could determine whether 10-year Treasury yields can scale the 3 percent psychological hurdle. Analysts at MUFG Securities said if Powell signalled the current tightening pace would remain, that would support global equity markets. “The major risk now lies in the DOTS increasing from three rate hikes to four,” they added, referring to the projected path for interest rate moves. Britain, meanwhile confirmed itself as one of the weak spots in the world economy, with data showing below-forecast 0.4 percent growth in the last quarter of 2017. That pushed sterling 0.2 percent lower against the dollar , a one-week low. To read Reuters Markets and Finance news, click here Reporting by Sujata Rao; Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in

2018-02-22,"VICTORIA (Reuters) - The island nation of Seychelles designated some of its fragile coastal areas for protection from commercial fishing, oil exploration and development this week in return for a novel deal relieving it of part of its sovereign debt. The Indian Ocean island, rich in underwater reefs and postcard-perfect beaches, defaulted on its debt in 2008 and clawed its way back to prosperity with assistance from the International Monetary Fund. Since then, government officials have been searching for ways to preserve their environment without endangering financial stability. So the finance ministry was intrigued when U.S.-based conservation group The Nature Conservancy approached it recently with a debt-for-nature financial proposal, the first in the world aimed at protecting a marine area. The deep-pocketed conservation group offered to buy up nearly $22 million of Seychelles’ outstanding $406 million sovereign debt in return for the country designating a third of its marine area as “protected”. The East African island nation of fewer than 100,000 people mainly relies on tourism and fishing for revenue, but in recent years oil and gas companies have been exploring its turquoise waters, home to dugongs, turtle and tuna. On Wednesday, Seychelles gave details on the first 210,000 square kilometre (81,000 square miles) area to be conserved, limiting activities like fishing, oil exploration and large-scale development in the most fragile habitats, while allowing them under certain conditions in the rest of the area.  The remaining 200,000 square km area, which will have different restrictions, will be announced later.    The Seychelles deal builds on 20 years’ worth of similar debt-for-nature swaps that have preserved vast tracts of tropical forests in Latin America and the Caribbean.  But it’s the first time the financing technique has been used to secure a marine environment, said Rob Weary, the head of NatureVest, which funds the group’s conservation deals.  “There’s not been one example of a country defaulting on a debt-for-nature swap,” he said.  Weary said the Seychelles deal — which will also help fund climate-change projects — could pave the way for other, larger deals where conservationists buy a country’s sovereign debt in return for policy changes designed to help the environment.  With an annual operating budget of $650 million per year, The Nature Conservancy’s funds dwarf many other, better-known charities such as Oxfam or the World Wildlife Foundation.  “Never before has there been so much funds available to support marine-based economic activities, the conservation of coastal and marine biodiversity and adaptation to climate change,” said Vice President Vincent Meriton when announcing the project. Reaction to the announcement was generally positive. PetroSeychelles’ head Patrick Joseph told Reuters that no explorers had shown an interest in the protected areas, but that he was unsure such stringent protection was necessary.  Fisherman Graham Green, 29, said he hoped it would rejuvenate traditional small-scale fishing.  “Long ago you would fish for just a few hours and not far out to sea and get a good catch of well-sized fish. But these days what you used to get in just one hour takes you a whole day,” he said.

2018-02-22,"(Adds quote, details, background) By Ahmed Rasheed BAGHDAD, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Iraq’s crude oil exports from its southern ports on the Gulf stand at 3.5 million barrels per day so far in February, two oil industry officials told Reuters on Thursday. “Despite repeated bad weather issues this month we expect the monthly average to stay at or slightly below 3.5 million barrels per day,” one of the officials said. Iraq’s total exports should be higher as the northern Iraqi Kurdistan region also exports about 200,000 bpd through a pipeline to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. Iraq is the second-largest producer of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), after Saudi Arabia. The country is producing below its maximum capacity of nearly 5 million bpd under an agreement between OPEC and other exporters including Russia to curtail output in order to support oil prices. Iraq plans to export oil to Iran from the northern Kirkuk oilfield using tanker trucks. Iraq and Iran agreed in December to swap up to 60,000 bpd of crude produced from Kirkuk for Iranian oil to be delivered to southern Iraq, with the crude trucked to Iran’s Kermanshah. The transportation was to start in late January and oil industry officials declined to give reasons for the delay other than it was technical in nature. Later officials said it would start this month but so far it has not. Iraqi forces launched a security operation along the planned oil transit route this month to clear the area from militants. Kirkuk crude sales have been halted since Iraqi forces took back control of the oilfields from the Kurds in October. Kurdish forces took control of Kirkuk in 2014, when the Iraqi army collapsed in the face of Islamic State. The Kurdish move prevented the militants from seizing the region’s oilfields. Iraq and Iran are also planning to build a pipeline to carry oil from Kirkuk. The planned pipeline could replace the existing export route from Kirkuk via Turkey and the Mediterranean.

Global majors Exxon Mobil and Total are considering plans to double LNG exports from Papua New Guinea to about 16 million tonnes per annum, their partner Oil Search said on Feb. 20. If approved, three new trains would be added to the existing Exxon-operated PNG LNG facility, with natural gas from Total’s fields supplying two of the units and the third using existing fields and a new Exxon development. While a final investment decision on the $13 billion expansion is still more than a year away, it’s a clear sign that LNG producers believe the market is headed for a deficit and that large-scale projects are once again viable. The LNG industry’s recent development has been characterised by periods of massive investment and capacity expansions followed by lulls amid fears of low prices caused by oversupply. The past decade has witnessed a rapid expansion of LNG capacity, with eight large-scale projects being built in Australia and six in the United States, as well as some others such as the Yamal venture in Russia. Most of these developments have started, or are due to start, within a fairly narrow time frame between 2016 and 2020, a bunching together of new capacity that led to widespread market concern of oversupply and weak prices. While it’s still likely that there may be some oversupply this year, and perhaps until the early 2020s, the market reality is that new LNG buyers in Asia and a surge in Chinese demand has eaten away most of the expected surplus. China imported 38 million tonnes of LNG in 2017, up 46.4 percent from the prior year, according to customs data. A few years ago there were forecasts that China would import as much as 60 million tonnes of LNG a year by the middle of the next decade, predictions that started to look wildly optimistic as LNG imports struggled to gain traction in the 2014-2016 period. However, a concerted effort by the authorities in Beijing to switch from more-polluting coal to natural gas has seen a surge in LNG imports, one that is likely to continue as cleaning up air pollution remains a priority, making 60 million tonnes per annum a realistic target. The attractiveness of LNG relative to coal has also been boosted by a declining spot price for LNG in Asia, which at the current $7.90 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) is less than half the peak of $20.50 reached in February 2014. It’s not just China turning to LNG, with other Asian countries including India, Pakistan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and others all planning to increase their capacity to re-gasify the super-chilled fuel. This new dynamic hasn’t gone unnoticed by LNG companies, which are starting to ramp up talk and action about new projects after a quiet few years spent trying to complete existing developments while navigating lower prices and buyer demands for more flexible contracts. Australia’s Woodside Petroleum, operator of the existing 16 million tonne per annum Northwest Shelf project, recently launched an almost $2 billion capital raising in order to buy control of an offshore field from partner Exxon, and use the natural gas for an expansion of its Pluto LNG plant. Mozambique’s vast resources are also getting closer to coming to market with Anadarko Petroleum announcing a sales agreement on Feb. 20, bringing it closer to a final investment decision. However, all these potential projects are facing quite a different market to the last round of mega-developments that are now coming on stream. Buyers, especially the majors in North Asia such as Japan, South Korea and China, have made it clear they want flexible contracts. This means an end to destination clauses, an end, or at least substantial changes, to the method of pricing LNG against crude oil and considerably shorter-term contracts, or even more spot deliveries. This makes it hard to secure the off-take agreements needed to secure funding for multi-billion dollar projects, meaning it’s likely that those companies with strong balance sheets that they can leverage off will enjoy greater chances of success in developing a new LNG plant. The LNG market is also likely to become more volatile and the seasonal swings may become more pronounced, especially if China remains the main driver of demand growth. China’s LNG demand is concentrated over the northern winter, when the fuel is used for mainly heating, replacing coal-fired boilers in both industry and residential use. While power demand for air-conditioning does increase during summer, China has comparatively little gas-fired generation, meaning demand for coal and other forms of electricity, such as hydro and nuclear, shoulder the burden. This dynamic is likely to lead to sharper price spikes during winter and declines in summer than has been the case in past years. Overall, the LNG market is shifting from being staid and focused on the long term to one characterised by rising volatility, shorter-term deals and increasing innovation.

2018-02-22,"* Battery firm rolls out car chargers to online community * Solar panel owners can step up power sharing, adding cars * Looking for partners in car, transmission grid sectors By Vera Eckert FRANKFURT, Feb 22 (Reuters) - German solar battery maker sonnen is giving away electric car plugs to new household customers, seeking to attract drivers frustrated by the slow roll-out of shared charging points and link them up to better manage power demand. The venture capital-backed start-up unveiled its 22 kilowatt sonnenCharger on Thursday for ordering by members of its online energy sharing platform in Germany, with first deliveries expected by the end of June. Philipp Schroeder, one of its managing directors, told Reuters the company hoped to create a network of electric vehicle (EV) owners to help manage the charging process and minimise disruption for power grids. “Automotive and power network companies will have to solve these problems anyway and we are hoping for partners,” he said. “There will have to be solutions for mass charging, otherwise the move to EVs will not work,” he added. Worldwide, sonnen has sold 30,000 batteries for storing solar power, mostly to rooftop solar panel owners. Its customers have the capacity to generate a combined 210 megawatts of solar power. In its core German market, some 80 to 90 percent of customers are signed up to the sonnenCommunity, which shares power production, consumption and storage via data apps. Customers that opt for a flat tariff get a guaranteed 8,000 kilowatt hours (kWh) of power per year - more than enough for a typical four person household, which uses around 5,000 kWh per year. That potentially leaves them with around 3,000 kWh to charge an EV, equating to a driving range of 15,000-17,000 km. With the EV plug, customers can choose between slow and fast charging and adjust the required volume, helping to reduce the potential run on power during peak loading times that developers of EV infrastructure say could be a problem. Sonnen also aims to market unused electricity from community members’ panels to the national power grid to help stabilise supply, and to market their battery capacity to absorb wind power whenever grids are unable to transport it to consumers. “Access to car batteries would give us additional storage capacity,” Schroeder said, adding this would cut down on the amount of wind power currently left unused at times of grid bottlenecks. Sonnen, which sells to foreign markets including Italy, the United States and Australia, saw a 24 million euro increase in turnover last year to around 65 million euros ($80 million), Schroeder said. $1 = 0.8121 euros

2018-02-22,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - Mansour and Nassima used to buy Swiss chocolate for their daughter. But in the past few days it has disappeared from the shelves as Algeria’s government implements a ban on imports of hundreds of products in an effort to cut the trade deficit. The restrictions will encourage domestic production, shielding it from foreign competition, officials say.  But local firms including drinks producers and potters say shortages of raw materials are putting their businesses at risk. Algeria’s non-energy sector remains undeveloped, meaning most goods consumed by its 40 million-strong people are shipped from abroad. Oil and gas account for 60 percent of the state budget.  At the start of this year, authorities banned the import of 851 products including foodstuffs and some raw materials in a bid to address a gaping trade deficit that widened as energy earnings almosty halved since mid-2014.  “Several products have disappeared. We’re talking about luxury products,” said Mansour, as he browsed the Ardis mall in the capital Algiers with his wife and six-year-old daughter. “Most prices have gone up, even those of national products, due to the lack of competition,” he said. “Today, I can’t see some of the goods I used to buy on the shelves, including good quality chocolate for my daughter,” said Nassima. Ardis, which opened its doors in 2012 and is the largest mall in the country, attracts flocks of consumers every day because of the wide range of local and imported consumer goods it stocks. That range has now been reduced, though Walid Allouni, the mall’s store manager, played down the change. “The import suspension is a problem for us, but this measure has affected only about 20 percent of the products we sell here,” he said. “Some prices have risen because demand exceeds supply. I think this is a good opportunity to strengthen and encourage domestic output.” In the past two years Algeria imposed a licensing system to reduce its imports bill, but that measure fell short of expectations. The value of purchases from abroad stood at $45.95 billion in 2017, down just 2.4 percent from the previous year. China, which has boosted its economic presence across North Africa, is Algeria’s main supplier, followed by France and Italy. Despite past promises to support economic diversification, local firms have struggled, hampered by bureaucracy and insufficient foreign investment that deprived them of much-needed technology.  The restrictions may only add to pressure on some firms, with managers voicing concern about a possible collapse of their business because of declining stocks of raw materials. On Sunday, the Association of Algerian Ceramicists published an open letter to Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia, urging him to ease limits on the import of the two main materials used in the industry. Domestic ceramics production falls short of demand, with products imported mainly from Spain and China filling the gap. The situation, it warned, could “cripple the sector.” Shortages of raw materials risk spreading to other sectors unless the government finds alternatives to the import suspension, businessmen say. “Some of our companies import 30 percent of their input needs,” said Ali Hamani, the head of Algerian Association for Drinks Producers, which includes 40 firms. “There are firms that risk closing.” Trade minister Mohamed Benmeradi said firms affected by the ban were “totally protected”, state news agency APS said. He did not elaborate.

2018-02-22,"* Investors price in more Fed tightening after minutes * Treasury yields ease off highs but world stocks at one-week low * Wall Street set for weaker session By Sujata Rao LONDON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - World stocks tumbled to one-week lows on Thursday after the U.S. Fed confirmed it was on track to raise interest rates several times this year, sending bond yields to new multi-year highs. While U.S. 10-year yields retreated after nearing the psychologically key 3 percent level, the minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s meeting at the end of January has at least temporarily taken the edge off investors’ appetite for equities and other assets perceived as risky, such as emerging markets and commodities. With Fed policymakers agreeing that “a gradual upward trajectory of the federal funds rate would be appropriate,” the odds in the market of faster U.S. interest rate hikes have narrowed and a host of Fed fund futures have hit contract lows. The dollar too was trading just off 10-day highs against a basket of currencies and was set for its first week of gains this year. Three rate rises are now almost fully priced in for 2018, compared with two as recently as December, and some traders are even contemplating the possibility of four rate rises in 2018. Marie Owens Thomsen, global head of economic research at Indosuez Wealth Management in Geneva, said markets seemed to have finally accepted a faster rate rise trajectory for 2018. But she saw no reason for an equity market collapse or sharp bond selloff. “When I look at the fundamentals, I see stable growth in all major economies, good earnings from the majority of companies and in a historical context, I see low interest rates and low inflation,” Owens Thomsen said. She was referring to 75 percent of U.S. S&P 500-listed firms which have beaten analysts’ forecasts with their fourth-quarter 2017 results, while in Europe the number stands at more than 53 percent according to Thomson Reuters data. Despite all the solid earnings reports, Wall Street saw steep losses on Wednesday after the Fed minutes, and Asian and European markets lost ground too, falling around 1 percent . The latter failed to even benefit from robust earnings updates from a series of firms ranging from British bank Barclays to French utility Veolia. MSCI’s all-country equity index fell 0.4 percent for its third straight day of losses while emerging equities lost 1 percent. New York was set for another weak session, futures suggested, with S&P futures down around 0.3 percent. Analysts noted that the January Fed meeting had happened after lawmakers approved a $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts, potentially adding more fuel to an economy which has already picked up steam. The 3 percent level on 10-year U.S. yields is seen as a huge psychological milestone for bulls and bears alike. In the meantime though the yield, which hit four-year highs around 2.96 percent after the minutes, retreated to 2.92 percent . Two-year yields touched new nine-year peaks. That weighed on euro zone yields, with the German 10-year benchmark down one basis point. Yields were also dampened by data showing German business confidence fell more than expected in February, though Europe’s biggest economy is clearly set for solid growth. The next hurdle for markets will be minutes from the European Central Bank’s last meeting at 1230 GMT, with investors keen to see if there was more talk of an eventual unwinding of stimulus. The “transatlantic spread” between German and U.S. 10-year borrowing costs widened to near a year high at 220 bps, reflecting the diverging monetary policy expectations between the two countries. Britain however confirmed itself as one of the weak spots in the world economy, with data showing below-forecast 0.4 percent growth in the last quarter of 2017. That pushed sterling 0.2 percent lower against the dollar, a one-week low. The firmer dollar pummelled commodities too - Brent crude futures were down 0.4 percent while gold and copper prices also fell . Reporting by Sujata Rao; Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in

2018-02-22,"BAMBOLIM, India (Reuters) - Caught between logistical bottlenecks and surging demand from power plants, India will likely increase coal imports in 2018, industry executives said, in what would be a setback to the government’s plans to cut the country’s dependence on foreign supplies.  The projected higher coal demand, which would reverse two years of declines, will be a boon for international miners such as Indonesia’s Adaro Energy (ADRO.JK), Australia’s Whitehaven Coal (WHC.AX) or global commodity merchant Glencore (GLEN.L).   But, the country’s power plants and cement makers, the source of the resurgent demand, will end up eating the cost of the higher-priced imports. State-owned Coal India (COAL.NS), the world’s second-biggest coal miner by production, is grappling with a shortage of trains to carry the fuel from its mines to the country’s power plants, according to the minutes of government meeting held on a Jan. 22 and reviewed by Reuters. India’s thermal coal imports may rise as much as 4 percent this year, with a steady 3 percent to 5 percent of growth expected over the next five years, a senior executive at Adani Enterprises (ADEL.NS), the country’s biggest coal trader, told Reuters.  “They (power plants) are not going to get the coal from Coal India as they were promised because of limitations on the infrastructure side,” said Rajendra Singh, Adani’s chief operating officer for coal trading. “Now, either you shut down, or you absorb the price (of imports)” he said. The train shortage in India has left about 10 power stations without spare coal supplies and 45 other plants with stockpiles that are less than seven days of consumption, the government meeting minutes showed.  In a statement, Coal India said that the company was given a target of 288 trains of coal per day for the fiscal year ending March 2019. In February, the company is averaging 264.2 trains per day and reached a peak of 286 on a single day. The company also said that the start up of two new railway lines should add between eight to 10 trains.  India needs a total of 332 coal trains per day to meet end-user demand, according to the Jan 22 meeting minutes. The stretched supply chains and higher costs for imports are worrying Indian power companies.  “The question is, how far do you stretch a rubber band? Today, it is pretty stretched,” said Vipul Tuli, chief executive officer of power company Sembcorp’s (SCIL.SI) India unit, referring to the rising costs of imported coal. After years without significant imports, state-run utilities in the states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat, have ordered several cargoes of Indonesian coal over the last month, Adani’s Singh said on the sidelines of an industry event in Bambolim in India’s Goa state last week. The utilities did not respond to calls for comment. The surge in imports has created a traffic jam of about 200 ships outside Indian ports, shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon showed. Data from consultants Wood Mackenzie shows that India’s seaborne imports of thermal coal fell 3.3 percent to 147 million tonnes in 2017. Rodrigo Echeverri, head of hard commodities research at Noble Group (NOBG.SI), said last week that Indian coal imports will rise in 2018 after falling for two straight years. Power generators are not the only source of additional coal demand. Cement makers are buying coal to replace the petroleum coke they use to fuel furnaces that make cement from minerals. In October, India banned the use around the capital of New Delhi of petroleum coke, or petcoke, a highly polluting fuel that is the solid remnants left over from processing fuel oil into fuels at oil refineries. While cement companies have gained exemptions from the ban, they are replacing some of their petcoke with coal to avoid production delays.   Petcoke consumption by cement makers will likely fall by 10 percent to 15 percent in 2018, said Kirik C. Gandhi, an executive at Shree Cement (SHCM.NS), adding that they will diversify into other fuels, mainly imported coal.  To further reduce petcoke consumption, the country in December raised the import duty on the fuel to 10 percent from 2.5 percent. Australian mining giant BHP (BHP.AX) said this week that the duty increase, which mostly impacts cement manufacturing, “is expected to add roughly 20 to 25 million tonnes to coal demand.” “We are all geared up (for more coal imports) because this question will come again for sure,” said Sanjay Kumar, an executive from cement maker Lafarge Holcim, referring to the potential for restrictions on petcoke usage.

2018-02-22,"BRUSSELS, Feb 22 (Reuters) - The European Union’s top court on Thursday said Poland had failed to uphold air quality standards, part of a wider battle by the EU to reduce deaths from airborne pollution which it estimates kills 400,000 people every year. The European Commission took Poland to court over its slow response in addressing the issue of poor air quality caused by extensive coal-burning in homes, which makes Poland’s air the most polluted in Europe. Siding with the Commission, the European Court of Justice ruled the limits in place to regulate the amount of pollutants in the air had been “persistently exceeded.” The air contained too much PM10, particulate matter smaller than 10 micrometers, which can damage health if breathed in. Not only did Poland exceed the daily legal amount of pollutants in 35 of its 46 “air quality zones,” nine of those zones failed an inspection of the annual legal limit as well, the court said. Bulgaria faced similar charges in April 2017, despite the European Commission’s pressure on countries to reduce pollutants. Last month, the European Commission warned nine other member states, including Germany and the United Kingdom, that it could take legal action if they did not present “additional credible, timely and effective measures” to tackle air pollutants. All have submitted information to be evaluated, according to a Commission spokesman. Targets introduced to reduce the amount of pollutants for 2005 and 2010 are being exceeded in 23 of the EU’s 28 members.

2018-02-22,"FRANKFURT, Feb 22 (Reuters) - German trade union IG BCE is urging 600 workers at three nuclear sites run by utility group E.ON to down tools on Feb. 26 in a pay dispute, a day before the next scheduled talks with management. The northern German Grohnde reactor is the site chosen for the protest action while staff from the Unterweser and Stade plants in the same region were invited to travel to Grohnde, a spokesman for IG BCE in Hanover said. While Grohnde is due to undergo maintenance from the weekend, Unterweser and Stade are already idle under Germany’s exit from nuclear power, but must be maintained for safety reasons ahead of a long decommissioning process. “Safety cover is of course arranged but we reckon with wider support for our action to underscore our demands,” the spokesman said. The news comes in the context of planned strikes in the French electricity sector in coming days that could cut production, adding to tightness in the interconnected European wholesale power market. While the German action’s impact on output will likely be small, it comes at a time when traders are nervous about this coinciding with rising mid-winter power demand. French week-ahead power is off Wednesday’s 13-week high but still at its highest level since early December. IG BCE is seeking a 5.5 percent pay rise for nuclear employees in E.ON’s PreussenElektra unit and those in regional subsidiary Avacon as well as at power network operator Tennet . Workers already protested at Avacon in Salzgitter on Monday. The union said employers had offered to raise salaries by 2.1 percent over 18 months. IG BCE, together with the Verdi union which shares representation of some 10,000 workers across E.ON, say the company’s offer left employees short, in comparison with related industries and given E.ON’s economic situation.

2018-02-22,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German prosecutors searched the homes of three new suspects in connection with Audi’s emissions scandal on Thursday, further widening their inquiry into the carmaker’s test-cheating scandal to include former executives. About two weeks after raiding Audi’s headquarters and one of its two German plants, Munich prosecutors said two of the three individuals affected by Thursday’s searches are former members of the Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) division’s top management board. Current Audi executives are still not among the suspects, the number of which has risen to 17, prosecutors said, adding the new suspects were considered to be partly responsible for the emissions trickery. Thursday’s searches overshadow a meeting of Audi’s supervisory board that is expected to discuss the luxury brand’s 2017 financial results, giving the latest proof that the Volkswagen (VW) group cannot seem to catch a break from its “Dieselgate” crisis. Last week, Audi’s chairman appealed to workers to ignore a media report saying the carmaker’s embattled chief executive, Rupert Stadler, was about to be fired.     Audi said on Thursday it was cooperating with prosecutors while parent VW declined comment. Audi, VW’s main profit contributor, did not admit to using illicit emissions control devices in the United States until November 2015, two months after the scandal at parent VW was revealed. The Ingolstadt-based carmaker developed the bigger 3.0 liter V6 diesel engines used in about 80,000 VW, Audi and Porsche models that in 2015 were found to be equipped with illicit software and to exceed U.S. emissions limits.

2018-02-22,"(Reuters) - Centrica stepped up plans for job cuts and cost savings on Thursday after the owner of energy supplier British Gas reported a 17 percent fall in annual operating profit.  It plans to cut 4,000 jobs and see annual cost savings of 1.25 billion pounds ($1.74 billion) by 2020, up from a previous target of 750 million. The company said it would cut about 1,000 jobs on a like-for-like basis in 2018 and save about 200 million pounds. The planned job cuts come atop some 5,500 jobs shed since the start of 2016. Centrica also said it aims to divest its 20 percent stake in the entity which operates the UK’s 15 operating nuclear reactors by the end of 2020, but analysts warned it might not be easy to find a buyer. “They have given themselves until 2020 to divest which suggests it’s not going to be the easiest sell in the world. I can’t imagine there will be a long list of buyers,” said Peter Atherton, an associate at consultancy Cornwall Insight. Centrica reported a 17 percent fall in 2017 adjusted operating profit to 1.25 billion pounds on revenue up 3 percent to 28.0 billion. In November it had warned of lower-than-expected full-year earnings citing its North American and British businesses. It saw a 6.6. percent fall in consumer energy supply customer accounts to 24.4 million, while business accounts fell 5.9 percent to 1.3 million.  British Gas raised its standard electricity tariff by 12.5 percent in September despite sliding customer numbers. “Its been a grim 2017 for Centrica but this was flagged in November so it hasn’t been a surprise,” Atherton said. Shares in the company were up 4 percent at 0955 GMT at 137.55 pence. “The combination of political and regulatory intervention in the UK energy market, concerns over the loss of energy customers in the UK, and the performance issue in North America have created material uncertainty around Centrica... We regret this deeply,” CEO Iain Conn said in a statement.

2018-02-22,"(Repeats to additional subscribers, no change to text) FRANKFURT, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Germany’s highest administrative court in Leipzig will on Thursday decide the fate of 15 million diesel vehicles in the country when it rules on whether cities in Europe’s largest car market can ban heavily polluting cars. Diesel-engine cars have been in the spotlight since Volkswagen in 2015 admitted to cheating exhaust tests, triggering a regulatory and legal backlash against diesel emissions, which contain particulate matter and nitrogen oxide (NOx) and are known to cause respiratory disease. Environmental group DUH has sued Stuttgart in Germany’s carmaking heartland, and Duesseldorf over levels of particulate matter exceeding European Union limits. The German states have appealed against the decisions, leaving Germany’s federal administrative court in Leipzig to rule on whether such bans are legal. Environmental groups say levels of particulate matter exceed the EU threshold in at least 90 German towns and cities. Carmakers have sought to avert a total ban with an agreement to overhaul engine management software on 5.3 million diesel cars as a way to clean up German cities. Environmental groups have called software updates insufficient and have lobbied for cars with Euro-6 and Euro-5 emissions standards to receive hardware updates of their exhaust treatment systems. German auto safety group ADAC said that hardware retrofits of Euro-5 vehicles cost between 1,400 and 3,300 euros and can cut diesel pollution by up to 70 percent. Retrofits would prove extremely costly for carmakers and an outright diesel ban could trigger a fall in vehicle resale prices, also known as residuals, which are used as a benchmark for pricing leasing and finance contracts. “The decline in diesel residuals towards the end of 2017 showed a clear acceleration, ending the year at 52.6 percent, having started the year at 56 percent,” analysts at Evercore ISI said in a note on Wednesday. Evercore ISI forecasts a 5 percent fall in diesel residual values could result in a drop of 1.6 billion euros ($2 billion) in operating profit across eight European and U.S. carmakers.

Oil services companies have been hit hard by a rout in oil and gas prices starting in 2014, but oil has risen around 45 percent from mid-2017 lows. Fugro was nevertheless cautious about the pace of recovery in the sector. “All the indications are of a stabilising market ... Exploration budgets are overall even slightly up which is also a good indication,” Chief Executive Paul van Riel said. “For offshore there still is a lot of over-capacity, that over-capacity needs to work its way out of the market, so I would like to make a cautionary remark that the pace of recovery I don’t think is going to be to be super fast,” he added. Fugro said it expects revenue to stabilise in 2018 with an improved EBIT margin and positive cash flow from operating activities after investments. The company reported full-year 2017 core profit (EBITDA), excluding exceptional items, of 100.8 million euros ($123.7 million), down 46.8 percent. Analysts polled for Reuters had expected full-year core profit of 119 million euros, while a company-compiled consensus forecast 112.5 million euros. The company said the results were “in line with expectations”. Shares were down 1.6 percent at 0947 GMT. In October the company guided for a double-digit decrease in revenue, a negative low-single digit EBIT margin and negative cash flow from operating activities after investments for the full year. On Thursday it reported full year revenue of 1.50 billion euros, down 13.2 percent on a currency comparable basis, a negative EBIT margin of 2.1 percent and negative cash flow from operating activities after investments of 50.5 million euros. “We had expected to see better results in 4Q17, with a larger contribution from the Geoscience segment,” KBC Securities analyst Cedric Duinslaeger said in a note. Degroof Petercam analyst Luuk van Beek said in a note the full year results were in line with his expectations, and that the company was “on track for recovery”. “In our view, Fugro is in a strong position to benefit from a market recovery, thanks to its unique expertise, recently optimized structure and reduced cost level,” he added.

2018-02-22,"* Borr to likely scrap 21 out of 32 rigs from Paragon * Says jack-up rig market remains challenging * Borr Drilling shares up 5.4 pct By Nerijus Adomaitis OSLO, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Offshore rig firm Borr Drilling , controlled by Norwegian investor Tor Olav Troeim, is proposing to buy its rival Paragon Offshore for $232.5 million in a push to consolidate the fragmented rig market, it said on Thursday. A plunge in oil prices in 2014 forced oil firms to cut back on offshore exploration, reducing demand for drilling rigs at a time when new rigs ordered during the boom years were entering the market, pushing rates down to, or below, operating costs. Borr said it was likely to scrap 21 older jack-up rigs, which have been stacked in various locations, out of Paragon’s total fleet of 32 rigs due to the high costs of reactivating them, as well as safety and efficiency standards. “As almost 50 percent of the global rig fleet is more than 30 years old, responsible owners should take steps to rationalise their fleets and consolidate the fragmented market,” Tor Olav Troeim, Borr’s chairman, said in the statement. Troeim is a high-profile investor in Norway who for years helped build the fortune of shipping billionaire John Fredriksen but has now struck out on his own. He sold his shares in insurer firm Storebrand on Wednesday. Following the transaction, at a price of $42.28 per share, Borr Drilling would own 24 premium jack-up rigs built after 2000, making it the world’s largest premium jack-up rig operator, Borr said. Jack-up rigs drill in shallow waters. Shares in Borr Drilling were up 5.4 percent at 0839 GMT against an Oslo benchmark index down 0.7 percent. Borr Drilling said it expected dayrates to start rising into 2019 as oil firms increase capital spending, a view shared by rival Maersk Energy, owned by A.A. Moller-Maersk, in a Reuters interview on Tuesday. “There are clear signs that we have passed the bottom of the offshore drilling cycle and the activity level is picking up,” Borr said. Still, Borr said it would not rush to sign new long-term contracts at current low rates and that many of its rigs would remain uncontracted in 2018. As of Jan. 31, Paragon, which last year emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States, had a revenue backlog of $204 million. It was spun off by U.S. firm Noble Corp in 2014. The deal’s closure is subject to Paragon completing all actions necessary to acquire ownership of certain rigs currently subject to Chapter 11 proceedings. Borr said it has received commitments from holders of 67.9 percent of Paragon’s shares for its tender offer, and expects the transaction to close in March.

2018-02-22,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Thursday it is investigating a Japanese report that a Chinese ship may have carried out a ship-to-ship transfer with a North Korean vessel in breach of U.N. sanctions. Japan said late on Tuesday that its military had spotted a North Korean-flagged tanker lying alongside a small vessel of unknown origin with Chinese characters on it in the East China Sea, indicating it was possibly an oil tanker from the southeastern Chinese province of Fujian. Japan suspects they were conducting ship-to-ship transfers banned by the U.N. Security Council and has informed the Security Council and shared the information with other countries, Japan’s Foreign Ministry said. North Korea last year conducted dozens of missile launches and its sixth and largest nuclear test in defiance of U.N. resolutions as it pursues its goal of developing a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China was paying great attention to Japanese report. “We are investigating,” he told a daily news briefing. China fully and strictly enforces U.N. resolutions and shoulders its international responsibilities, Geng added. China had explicitly banned ship-to-ship transfers that run counter to U.N. resolutions, he said. China has repeatedly said it is fully enforcing all resolutions against North Korea, despite suspicion in Washington, Seoul and Tokyo that loopholes still exist. A confidential report by independent U.N. monitors to a U.N. Security Council sanctions committee, seen by Reuters earlier this month, said they had investigated cases of ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products in violation of sanctions and that the network behind the vessels was primarily based in Taiwan. The monitors said one country, which they did not name, told them North Korea had carried out such transfers off its ports of Wonsan and Nampo and in international waters between the Yellow Sea and East China Sea between October and January. North Korea will send another high-level delegation to South Korea for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics closing ceremony, officials said on Thursday, including the man blamed for the 2010 sinking of a South Korean navy ship that killed 46 sailors.

2018-02-22,"FRANKFURT, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Germany’s highest administrative court in Leipzig will on Thursday decide the fate of 15 million diesel vehicles in the country when it rules on whether cities in Europe’s largest car market can ban heavily polluting cars. Diesel-engine cars have been in the spotlight since Volkswagen in 2015 admitted to cheating exhaust tests, triggering a regulatory and legal backlash against diesel emissions, which contain particulate matter and nitrogen oxide (NOx) and are known to cause respiratory disease. Environmental group DUH has sued Stuttgart in Germany’s carmaking heartland, and Duesseldorf over levels of particulate matter exceeding European Union limits. The German states have appealed against the decisions, leaving Germany’s federal administrative court in Leipzig to rule on whether such bans are legal. Environmental groups say levels of particulate matter exceed the EU threshold in at least 90 German towns and cities. Carmakers have sought to avert a total ban with an agreement to overhaul engine management software on 5.3 million diesel cars as a way to clean up German cities. Environmental groups have called software updates insufficient and have lobbied for cars with Euro-6 and Euro-5 emissions standards to receive hardware updates of their exhaust treatment systems. German auto safety group ADAC said that hardware retrofits of Euro-5 vehicles cost between 1,400 and 3,300 euros and can cut diesel pollution by up to 70 percent. Retrofits would prove extremely costly for carmakers and an outright diesel ban could trigger a fall in vehicle resale prices, also known as residuals, which are used as a benchmark for pricing leasing and finance contracts. “The decline in diesel residuals towards the end of 2017 showed a clear acceleration, ending the year at 52.6 percent, having started the year at 56 percent,” analysts at Evercore ISI said in a note on Wednesday. Evercore ISI forecasts a 5 percent fall in diesel residual values could result in a drop of 1.6 billion euros ($2 billion) in operating profit across eight European and U.S. carmakers.

2018-02-22,"(Refiles story to remove link to map) * Indian refining margins expected at $7-$8 per barrel * Crude to stay stable if no geo-political tensions arise * Indian refiners hope for sub-$70 crude oil this year * Good margins to fill govt coffers ahead of elections By Promit Mukherjee and Nidhi Verma MUMBAI/NEW DELHI, Feb 22 (Reuters) - India state refiners expect their profit margins to hold their strength this year as demand growth accelerates for fuel products amid a record $93 billion spent on infrastructure and stable crude oil prices, company executives and analysts said. India’s sales of cars and especially motorbikes are forecast to rise rapidly, even as the development of a Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor drives consumption of the country’s primary fuel products, diesel and gasoline. The infrastructure programme for fiscal 2018/19 calls for more than 80,000 km (50,000 miles) in new highways to better connect rural areas with urban hubs. Roads and other construction require oil-based products such as tar and plastic piping, and fuel to move materials by truck and rail. “They (these projects) will have a cascading effect on fuel demand,” said R. Ramachandran, director of refineries at Bharat Petroleum, adding that this would be reflected directly in strong refining margins. India’s annual fuel demand, made up mainly of diesel and gasoline, is expected to grow 7.5 percent in 2018, according to a report by BMI Research, a unit of Fitch. That compares with 5.4 percent last year, according to government data. “Strong fundamentals and rising demand in India indicate that refining margins will remain strong in the near term, for at least six months,” Ramachandran said. Refining margins also rely heavily on global crude oil prices, currently around $65 a barrel, and on the status of world inventories of refined products. Indian refiners hope global prices will remain sub-$70 per barrel as world oil production rises while new refining capacity doesn’t keep the pace. The International Energy Agency said this month it expects oil production to slightly outpace demand this year, especially thanks to still rising output in the United States. M. K. Surana, head of Hindustan Petroleum Corp, said he expected international crude prices between $62 and $68 a barrel this year, as long as there are no geopolitical crises or technical disturbances like damage to the Forties pipeline. Based on that expectation, India’s refiners should see refining margins, also known as cracks, in the range of $7-$8 per barrel for all three state-owned refiners. “Products demand continues to rally on better industrial performance and weather-related support ... Rising oil prices have done little to dampen the growth so far,” said Sri Paravaikkarasu, head of East of Suez Oil, at consultancy FGE. FGE expects Singapore margins to hold around $6-$7 a barrels due to upcoming refinery maintenance and summer demand. “The margins for Indian refiners will be slightly better ... as India prices its products on import parity basis,” she said. Asia’s benchmark margins DUB-SIN-REF in the oil trading hub of Singapore currently stand around $7.20 per barrel. Better refining margins for the state-owned refiners - and improved profit from selling retail fuel - will pump more cash into government coffers ahead of key elections this year and next for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who needs money for his ambitious healthcare and infrastructure programmes. The cash inflow would come just ahead of eight state elections this year and national elections in 2019. Healthy profits will also help the state-owned refiners to continue spending on expansion plans. India aims to increase its refining capacity by 77 percent to about 8.8 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2030, which will cost dozens of billions of dollars. State-run refiners Indian Oil Corp Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp and Bharat Petroleum Corp, that sell most of their output locally at prices linked to global rates, largely reported strong profits and margins for the October-December quarter. While Indian gasoline and diesel prices are linked to global rates, during state or central elections private rivals say state-owned firms often do not increase retail selling rates - a risk to margins, analysts point out, only if crude prices suddenly spike. “We expect margins to improve ... Cracks appear to be good,” said B. V. Rama Gopal, head of refineries at IOC. Reporting by Promit Mukherjee in MUMBAI and Nidhi Verma in NEW

2018-02-22,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Environment group Greenpeace on Thursday called on Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to tackle an air pollution “crisis” in Bangkok, weeks after a pollution agency said the city’s air quality had hit dangerous levels. Air pollution has been under the spotlight in Bangkok, one of the world’s most popular tourist cities, with many residents complaining about smog. Greenpeace said Bangkok suffered the worst air pollution in its history between Jan. 1 and Feb. 21. The Pollution Control Department warned this month that the level of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometres, or PM2.5 dust, in the city had hit unhealthy levels and asked children to stay indoors. PM2.5 dust, the most dangerous kind, includes pollutants such as nitrates that can penetrate the cardiovascular system. Critics blame Bangkok’s worsening air pollution on lax enforcement of vehicle emission standards, poor urban planning and insufficient green spaces. Greenpeace activists presented an hourglass filled with dust from Bangkok and other provinces most affected by severe air pollution to a government representative. “Bangkok cannot continue choking on hazardous air,” said Tara Buakamsri, director of Greenpeace in Thailand. “It endangers the lives of people, affects economic productivity and negatively impacts the prestige of one of the most popular cities on earth.” The prime minister, who is also the chairman of the National Environment board, should order an improvement in air quality, he said. The PM2.5 level in central Bangkok was at 22.5 micrograms per m3 on Thursday, according to the AirVisual smartphone application. Earlier this month, the pollution department measured PM2.5 dust in Bangkok at 72-95 micrograms per m3. That compares with a World Health Organization (WHO) guideline of an annual average of no more than 10 micrograms.

2018-02-22,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: Top LNG exporters, importers: tmsnrt.rs/2BtShEX By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Feb 22 (Reuters) - If you were looking for signs that the liquefied natural gas (LNG) merry-go-round is starting to spin a little faster, the announcement of a planned massive expansion in Papua New Guinea is ample evidence. Global majors Exxon Mobil and Total are considering plans to double LNG exports from Papua New Guinea to about 16 million tonnes per annum, their partner Oil Search said on Feb. 20. If approved, three new trains would be added to the existing Exxon-operated PNG LNG facility, with natural gas from Total’s fields supplying two of the units and the third using existing fields and a new Exxon development. While a final investment decision on the $13 billion expansion is still more than a year away, it’s a clear sign that LNG producers believe the market is headed for a deficit and that large-scale projects are once again viable. The LNG industry’s recent development has been characterised by periods of massive investment and capacity expansions followed by lulls amid fears of low prices caused by oversupply. The past decade has witnessed a rapid expansion of LNG capacity, with eight large-scale projects being built in Australia and six in the United States, as well as some others such as the Yamal venture in Russia. Most of these developments have started, or are due to start, within a fairly narrow time frame between 2016 and 2020, a bunching together of new capacity that led to widespread market concern of oversupply and weak prices. While it’s still likely that there may be some oversupply this year, and perhaps until the early 2020s, the market reality is that new LNG buyers in Asia and a surge in Chinese demand has eaten away most of the expected surplus. China imported 38 million tonnes of LNG in 2017, up 46.4 percent from the prior year, according to customs data. A few years ago there were forecasts that China would import as much as 60 million tonnes of LNG a year by the middle of the next decade, predictions that started to look wildly optimistic as LNG imports struggled to gain traction in the 2014-2016 period. However, a concerted effort by the authorities in Beijing to switch from more-polluting coal to natural gas has seen a surge in LNG imports, one that is likely to continue as cleaning up air pollution remains a priority, making 60 million tonnes per annum a realistic target. The attractiveness of LNG relative to coal has also been boosted by a declining spot price for LNG in Asia, which at the current $7.90 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) is less than half the peak of $20.50 reached in February 2014. It’s not just China turning to LNG, with other Asian countries including India, Pakistan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and others all planning to increase their capacity to re-gasify the super-chilled fuel. This new dynamic hasn’t gone unnoticed by LNG companies, which are starting to ramp up talk and action about new projects after a quiet few years spent trying to complete existing developments while navigating lower prices and buyer demands for more flexible contracts. Australia’s Woodside Petroleum, operator of the existing 16 million tonne per annum Northwest Shelf project, recently launched an almost $2 billion capital raising in order to buy control of an offshore field from partner Exxon, and use the natural gas for an expansion of its Pluto LNG plant. Mozambique’s vast resources are also getting closer to coming to market with Anadarko Petroleum announcing a sales agreement on Feb. 20, bringing it closer to a final investment decision. However, all these potential projects are facing quite a different market to the last round of mega-developments that are now coming on stream. Buyers, especially the majors in North Asia such as Japan, South Korea and China, have made it clear they want flexible contracts. This means an end to destination clauses, an end, or at least substantial changes, to the method of pricing LNG against crude oil and considerably shorter-term contracts, or even more spot deliveries. This makes it hard to secure the off-take agreements needed to secure funding for multi-billion dollar projects, meaning it’s likely that those companies with strong balance sheets that they can leverage off will enjoy greater chances of success in developing a new LNG plant. The LNG market is also likely to become more volatile and the seasonal swings may become more pronounced, especially if China remains the main driver of demand growth. China’s LNG demand is concentrated over the northern winter, when the fuel is used for mainly heating, replacing coal-fired boilers in both industry and residential use. While power demand for air-conditioning does increase during summer, China has comparatively little gas-fired generation, meaning demand for coal and other forms of electricity, such as hydro and nuclear, shoulder the burden. This dynamic is likely to lead to sharper price spikes during winter and declines in summer than has been the case in past years. Overall, the LNG market is shifting from being staid and focused on the long term to one characterised by rising volatility, shorter-term deals and increasing innovation.

2018-02-22,"* Most Asia share markets lower, S&P futures extend retreat * Investors price in more Fed tightening after minutes * Treasury yields near cycle highs, Fed futures at contract lows * Dollar holds most gains, except on safe-haven yen By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Most Asian share markets followed S&P 500 futures lower on Thursday as speculation of faster hikes in U.S interest rates soured risk appetite globally. The dollar held onto most of its overnight gains courtesy of higher Treasury yields, though the sudden shift to safety also spurred demand for the Japanese yen. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 lost 0.3 percent and FTSE futures slid 0.8 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.8 percent, with most of the region in the red. Japan’s Nikkei shed 1.1 percent, with office equipment maker Ricoh down more than 5 percent on news it was conducting impairment tests. Chinese markets were in a better mood, returning from their long holiday break with a gain of 2 percent for the Shanghai blue-chip index. On Wall Street, the Dow had ended Wednesday down 0.67 percent, while the S&P 500 fell 0.55 percent and the Nasdaq 0.22 percent. The retreat came after minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting showed the usual concerns that inflation might disappoint, but also an expectation of faster economic growth due to fiscal stimulus. In particular, members agreed that “the strengthening in the near-term economic outlook increased the likelihood that a gradual upward trajectory of the federal funds rate would be appropriate.” That led investors to narrow the odds on faster hikes with a host of Fed fund futures hitting contract lows. Three rate rises are now almost fully priced in for this year, compared to two as recently as December. “Participants saw a more favourable outlook as supporting gradual rate hikes,” noted Barclays analyst Michael Gapen. “Since then, more stimulus has arrived and there is some tentative, though not conclusive, evidence of stronger wage and inflation data,” he added. “We continue to expect four rate hikes in 2018 and 2019.” That risk was not welcome in the Treasury market, where yields on 10-year notes touched their highest in four years, and those on two-year paper the highest in nine. Yields on 10-year debt were last trading at 2.94 percent and creeping ever closer to 3 percent - a huge psychological milestone for bulls and bears alike. For once, the lift in yields seemed to benefit the U.S. dollar which edged up to 90.123 against a basket of currencies after having rallied 0.3 percent overnight. The euro slipped to $1.2274, from a $1.2359 top on Wednesday and looked in danger of testing its February trough at $1.2204. The next hurdle will be minutes from the European Central Bank’s last meeting with markets wary in case there is more talk of an eventual winding back on stimulus. The dollar fared less well on the yen as the Japanese currency caught a safe-haven bid, falling back to 107.32 from an early 107.68. The euro skidded to its lowest on the yen in three months at 131.57 and risked cracking major support at its 200-day moving average of 131.12. Higher bond yields were a deadweight on gold, which pays no return, and left the metal stuck at $1,323.88 an ounce.

2018-02-22,"MELBOURNE, Feb 22 (Reuters) - German battery maker Sonnen GmbH will set up a battery manufacturing hub in South Australia state this year to tap what it sees as the fastest global growth market for solar rooftop storage, its Australia managing director said on Thursday. The plant will make around 10,000 solar batteries a year for the first five years, once it is set up in six to nine months, Chris Parratt said. Sonnen is the world’s largest producer of household batteries and solar energy storage systems. “We believe that Australia will be the biggest market for storage over the next five years,” Parratt told Reuters. “At the moment, Germany is the biggest. But we think given the conditions in Australia: high energy prices; an affluent society; high penetration of solar; these things all add up.” Sonnen will import the battery cells, which are not manufactured in Australia, and rely on local supply for the rest of the products. The company did not say how much money it would be putting into its South Australia investment. Sonnen will also become the second battery maker to set up a “virtual power plant” in South Australia, which last summer saw blackouts ripple across the state, forcing mining giant BHP Billiton  and aluminium maker Alcoa Corp to suspend production. Sonnen’s installed battery units will be linked together to serve as a power bank, absorbing power when there is a surplus of energy and releasing it to the grid when there is a shortage. South Australian Labor party previously engaged entrepreneur Elon Musk to build the world’s biggest lithium ion battery which went into operation on December 1, in time to feed the state’s shaky power grid for the first day of summer. The state government this week announced that it would increase its target for power produced by renewables to 75 percent by 2025 and also introduced a 25 percent target for renewable storage.

The dollar held onto most of its overnight gains courtesy of higher Treasury yields, though the sudden shift to safety spurred demand for the Japanese yen. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.8 percent, while E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 lost 0.5 percent.

2018-02-22,"(Inserts dropped letter in headline) WASHINGTON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Wednesday piled on more import duties on biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia, adding anti-dumping duties of 60.44 percent to 276.65 percent to already steep anti-subsidy duties on the fuels. The final determination is subject to a second ruling by the U.S. International Trade Commission on April 6 on whether U.S. biodiesel producers were injured by dumped imports from the two countries. But the independent panel has already found in the subsidy cases that the imports caused such injuries. The latest duties make it virtually certain that biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia will not be sold in the U.S. market, with combined rates of up to 159 percent on the Argentine fuel and up to 341 percent on Indonesian variety. The Commerce Department set final dumping duties for Argentine biodiesel at 60.44 percent to 86.41 percent, and for Indonesian biodiesel at 92.52 percent to 276.65 percent. “Today’s decision allows U.S. producers of biodiesel to receive relief from the market-distorting effects of foreign producers dumping into the domestic market,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement. “While the United States values its relationship with Argentina and Indonesia, even our closest friends must play by the rules.” The latest duties come just two weeks after a budget deal in the U.S. Congress reinstated a $1 per gallon biodiesel tax credit, which is expected to improve profitability for domestic producers. The trade case was filed by the National Biodiesel Board and 15 member companies that alleged a flood of subsidized imports sold below fair market value was preventing U.S. producers from earning an adequate return. “Today’s decision provides room for the domestic biodiesel industry to flourish and produce more volumes of this American-made fuel which provides so many economic and environmental benefits,” Kurt Kovarik, the trade group’s president, said in a statement.

2018-02-22,"* Stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for some buyers * Dollar outweighs API report of lower U.S. crude inventories By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday, pulled down as a firmer dollar outweighed a report of a decrease in U.S. crude inventories. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $61.12 a barrel at 0102 GMT, down 56 cents, or 0.9 percent, from their last settlement. Brent crude futures had dropped 50 cents, or 0.8 percent, from their last close to $64.92 per barrel. The dollar rose to a more than one-week peak against a basket of other currencies late on Wednesday, extending its recovery from last week, as minutes of the Federal Reserve’s January meeting showed policymakers confident in the need to keep raising interest rates. “The firming dollar continues to thwart investor sentiment despite the bullish inventory data,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA. Since oil trading is conducted in dollars, a rise in the greenback makes fuel imports for countries using other currencies domestically more expensive, potentially curbing demand. The firm dollar outweighed a reported fall in U.S. crude inventories. The American Petroleum Institute on Wednesday reported an unexpected drop in U.S. crude oil inventories by 907,000 barrels to 420.3 million barrels for the week to Feb. 16. “Improved pipeline infrastructure to the Gulf coast and the decreased supply via TransCanada’s Keystone pipeline, sent ... inventories tumbling,” Innes said.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.35 percent in early trade, while E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 lost 0.2 percent.

2018-02-22,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela is preparing a new cryptocurrency called “petro gold” that will be backed by precious metals, President Nicolas Maduro said on Wednesday, a day after launching an oil-backed token that has been panned as a pipe dream by blockchain experts. Maduro is hoping cryptocurrencies will help Venezuela skirt U.S. financial sanctions as it struggles under hyperinflation and a collapsing socialist economy.  On Tuesday, he said the newly launched petro cryptocurrency raised $735 million in the first day of a pre-sale. Opposition leaders call the state-backed cryptocurrency an illegal debt issue, and investors have questioned its value given concerns about Venezuela’s solvency and transparency. “Next week I’m going to launch the petro gold, backed by gold, which is even more powerful, that will strengthen the petro,” Maduro said in a televised speech. It was not immediately evident if he was referring to gold reserves in the central bank or to undeveloped mineral deposits. He did not offer further details. The Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.     Gold-backed cryptocurrencies already exist, including one called RMG created by The Royal Mint in Britain. But blockchain experts have broadly panned Venezuela’s cryptocurrency efforts, noting that digital tokens are only as valuable as the faith inspired by their issuer.  The country’s history of uncompensated expropriations and the 99 percent depreciation of its fiat currency the bolivar have created doubts about the ruling Socialist Party’s capacity to manage digital tokens. Blockchain technology is built on making information about transactions open to the public. But the Socialist Party jealously guards even the most basic of information - including about inflation. The U.S. Treasury Department has already warned that Venezuelan cryptocurrencies could violate sanctions and thus create legal risk for U.S. investors. Sean Walsh, founder of crypto-asset investment firm Redwood City Ventures, said it was difficult to reach conclusions about the petro gold without seeing specific details. But he said he had little interest in tokens backed by physical assets. “Rather than buying a cryptocurrency backed by gold, I’d just go buy the gold,” said Walsh in a telephone interview. “Gold is a physical thing that you want to be able to hold in your hands, because that’s the point.” Editing by Tom Brown",https://uk.reuters.com/article/crypto-currencies-venezuela/update-2-venezuela-aims-for-crypto-alchemy-with-new-petro-gold-token-idUKL2N1QB26Y,22 Feb 2018,"Venezuela is preparing a new
