2019-01-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran will see its crude exports severely curtailed for a third month in January as it is struggling to find new buyers amid U.S. sanctions even though its traditional customers secured waivers, according to tanker data and industry sources. Iran’s crude exports in November plummeted as sanctions kicked in to below 1 million barrels per day (bpd) from regular sales of 2.5 million bpd in April, taking them back to where they stood during previous sanctions in 2012-2016. Buyers said plunging exports in November, which will severely hit the Islamic Republic’s budget revenues, were caused by a total lack of clarity of what volumes they were allowed to purchase under the new U.S. sanctions. Washington later gave a fairly generous set of waivers to eight traditional Iranian oil buyers - including China, India, Japan and South Korea - to avoid a rally in oil prices, but the measure has failed to give a meaningful boost to exports. (GRAPHIC: Monthly Iranian crude oil exports since 2011 - tmsnrt.rs/2ADK8wr) According to sources at three companies that track Iranian exports, Iran’s crude shipments remained below 1 million bpd in December and are unlikely to exceed that level in January despite rising month on month. “In January, I expect a slight uptick in the second half of the month with some Asian lifting resuming,” one of the sources said. “For the time being, I am penciling in around 900,000 bpd for January.” One of the sources said actual shipments so far in January were running at about half that amount. Regular buyer Taiwan said last year it was not yet buying Iranian oil despite receiving a waiver because of a lack of a clear payment mechanism. Iran has said its exports have not declined as much as estimated by the industry because it was selling oil to new buyers. But it declined to disclose them because of a fear of new sanctions. A restrained level of Iranian shipments would assist the new global push to cut oil supply in 2019 led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, from which Iran is exempt, and lend support to oil prices. “We are forecasting slightly more than December, but not massive,” said a source at another company that monitors Iranian shipments, putting the month-on-month rise at below 50,000 bpd. Iranian exports are higher if condensate, a type of light oil, is counted as well as crude. Kpler, another company that tracks oil flows, put Iranian crude and condensate exports at 1.35 million bpd in December. Tracking Iranian exports has become harder since the sanctions began as ships switch off tracking systems, industry sources say, keeping some of the shipments hidden.  According to Refinitiv Eikon data, shipments including condensate plunged to about 650,000 bpd in December, although such figures are probably not counting all the tankers that switch off their AIS tracking signal. Some buyers that stayed away in November are returning.   Turkey has resumed imports of Iranian oil after a one-month hiatus in November, Reuters reported on Tuesday, at a volume less than half of the pre-sanctions amount. Shipments were at least 2.5 million bpd in April, the month before U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and reimposed sanctions. Tehran has vowed to keep exporting oil despite the U.S. effort to reduce its shipments to zero.

2019-01-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - By the end of last year, hedge fund positions in diesel had fallen to a level normally associated with a sharp slowdown in economic growth if not an outright recession. Most middle distillate fuels such as diesel, gasoil and jet fuel are consumed in freight transport (ships, trucks, railroads and air cargo) as well as manufacturing and mining. Middle distillate consumption and prices are therefore more closely tied to the state of the economy than other refined fuels such as gasoline. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2HjMiXV) For the last 25 years, hedge funds and other speculators, collectively termed “non-commercial traders”, have mostly held a net long or bullish position in distillate futures and options. The typical net long position reflects the overall expansion of the U.S. and global economies (expansions have been long while recessions have been relatively short). In most cases, when non-commercial traders have switched to a substantial net short or bearish position the economy has been experiencing a sharp slowdown or is already in recession. Large net short positions in 1995, 1998, 2002, 2010 and 2015 were all associated with slowdowns or recessions according to contemporary statements or minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee. The exception was the net short position at the end of 2004, which came six months after the Fed noted a “soft patch” in the expansion, by which time the economy was improving enough for the Fed to raise interest rates again. Crucially, not all these episodes ended in a recession; some were transient slowdowns in an uninterrupted expansion. But given this history, the large liquidation of speculative long positions in diesel futures during the fourth quarter of 2018 was consistent with a substantial deterioration in the economic outlook. Non-commercial traders started 2018 with a record bullish position in U.S. diesel futures equivalent to 64 million barrels of fuel, with more bullish positions held in options and European derivatives such as gasoil. At the start of the fourth quarter, they still held a very large net long position equivalent to almost 48 million barrels, suggesting most speculators continued to anticipate a strong economic expansion. But the net long position had disappeared by the end of November and turned into a net short of 8 million barrels by the middle of December, coinciding with the slump in equity markets and fears about the economic outlook. Unfortunately, there is no more recent data on non-commercial positions because of the partial shutdown of the U.S. federal government. By the middle of December, the net short position was not yet at a level signalling a slowdown or recession, but the trend was clear. The fall in non-commercial diesel positions was consistent with other indicators of slackening economic activity including the decline in equity prices, yield curve inversion, business surveys and slowing freight growth. At the end of 2018, the distillate market, like other financial markets and the economy, was balanced uncertainly on the brink of a slowdown. What happens next depends critically on whether the U.S. and global economies accelerate again, settle into an extended soft patch, or slump into recession. If the rate of economic expansion quickens again, hedge funds and other speculators will close some of their short positions and rebuild a significant net long position, exerting upward pressure on diesel and crude prices. The process may already have started in recent days as traders become more optimistic the United States and China will reach an agreement, or at least a truce, in their trade war. But if the economy settles into a more sluggish phase, or stalls and slips into recession, further hedge fund selling will put renewed downward pressure on diesel and crude.

2019-01-11,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Any attempts by the United States to stop Europe buying Russian gas via additional sanctions against Moscow would be an attack on the continent’s sovereignty, a German business group said on Friday. The United States has threatened, but not so far levied, sanctions against European companies participating in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is being built by a consortium led by Russian state gas giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM). The pipeline, which would carry gas straight to Germany under the Baltic Sea, is driving a wedge between Germany and its allies as it would deprive Ukraine of the lucrative gas transit fees it currently enjoys. “If the U.S. decided to sanction the use of Russian gas, that would be an attack on German and European sovereignty,” Wolfgang Buechele, chairman of the German Committee on East European Economic Relations, told a new year news conference. Any move in that direction should draw a sharp response from Berlin, he said. “I believe the Nord Stream 2 project is in the pure interests of not just Germany but also of Europe,” Buechele said of the pipeline, which would feed into Europe-wide gas transmission networks. The German Committee on East European Economic Relations is an umbrella group representing German firms doing business in Eastern Europe. Nord Stream 2 has also divided Germany’s political class. Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, bound by friendship to Russian President Vladimir Putin, has senior roles in the Nord Stream 2 holding company as well as at state-owned energy firms Gazprom (GAZP.MM) and Rosneft (ROSN.MM). Others, especially in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats, are notably cooler on the project, which, though owned by Gazprom, numbers German energy company Uniper (UN01.DE) and BASF-owned (BASFn.DE) oil company Wintershall [WINT.UL] among its financial investors. Buechele said Europe had no alternative to Russian gas, adding that the liquefied natural gas that Washington has touted as an alternative was both more expensive and more harmful to the environment. “We need these resources in the long term,” he said. Germany’s manufacturing sector is heavily reliant on exports to Russia and was hard hit hard by EU and U.S. sanctions levied after Russia invaded and annexed parts of neighboring Ukraine, and again after U.S. sanctions were ratcheted up late last year. The committee said it expected trade with Russia to stagnate this year - even as trade with neighboring Poland, with less than a third the population, reached a record high of 120 billion euros ($138 billion) last year, twice the volume of Germany’s Russia trade.

Equity funds drew inflows of $6.2 billion, their biggest in 11 weeks, Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists said on Friday, citing data from EPFR on flows in the week to Jan. 9. Some $7.2 billion flowed into bond funds, the biggest taking in 39 weeks. BAML’s “Bull/Bear” gauge of investor positioning fell to 1.8 last week, what the strategists called “extreme bear territory”, triggering a “buy” signal for equities. “Initial skepticism on size and duration of rally... quickly morphed into chase via stocks in EM and U.S. but not Europe,” BAML strategists wrote, commenting on feedback from clients after the signal. The gauge crawled back up to 2.2, or “neutral” territory, this week. In the U.S., growth stocks and large-cap stocks drew the biggest inflows with $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion respectively, while $700 million evaporated from value stocks. Comments from Powell stressing that the U.S. central bank can be patient in approving any further rate increases have triggered relief among investors who were fretting continued rate rises may be a mistake. In another sign of healthy risk appetite, emerging market assets were popular with both equity and bond funds drawing in $2.4 billion, while high-yield bond funds received $1.5 billion inflows. Europe remained unpopular with $100 million outflows. European equity funds have suffered outflows in 43 of the past 44 weeks. In sectors, investors pulled $600 million from tech stocks and $1.5 billion from financials stocks. They also dumped $1.4 billion of investment-grade bonds. What could sustain the risk rally is inflows to credit funds, strategists said. These would signal that the Fed “has short-circuited vicious cycle of higher credit spreads and weaker growth”, they wrote. “Green shoots” from Asian or European macroeconomic data would also help support further gains, they added. European stocks climbed to a one-month high on Friday and eyed their fourth straight day of gains, which would be their longest winning streak since November.

With more promises of patience from Federal Reserve, the ECB mulling another dump of cheap money and news that trade talks between Washington and Beijing are moving to higher levels, the Friday feeling was in full effect. Asia had crawled to a 5-week high overnight thanks to China and Japan, and European stocks were up for what could be the fourth straight day of gains and longest winning streak since September. The Fed’s dovish stance also pushed down the dollar and nudged Treasury yields lower after five days of gains again. That cheered emerging markets and confidence more generally having been flattened during the brutal end to 2018. “Equities are having a good run after a pretty horrible end to last year,” said Rabobank quantitative analyst Bas Van Geffen. “It is the changing wording of the Fed, it seems to be making more and more room for an eventual pause (in the rate hike cycle)”. The index of Europe’s leading 300 shares was up 0.3 percent in early trade at 1377 points, its highest in almost a month. Germany’s DAX was up 0.1 percent and France’s CAC was up 0.2 percent at 4814 points. The big gainer among Europe’s leading indices was Britain’s FTSE, up 0.7 percent at 6992 points on the back of the latest slide in sterling against the euro on mounting Brexit uncertainty. Wall Street’s strong performance on Thursday was another positive driver. The S&P 500 is now up more than 10 percent from its Dec. 26 low, and futures point to another rise at the open on Friday. At the Economic Club of Washington on Thursday, Fed chief Jerome Powell reiterated the U.S. central bank would be patient about hiking interest rates. “The word ‘patient’ is used often when the Fed’s policy direction is still tightening but its next rate hike can wait for a considerable time. So risk assets now enjoy support from what we can call Powell put,” said Tomoaki Shishido, economist at Nomura Securities. “Similarly, Trump also softened his stance on China after sharp falls in stock prices. He has offered an olive branch to China and there’s no reason China would not want to accept it,” he added. U.S. and Chinese officials are working on arrangements for higher-level trade talks after mid-level officials this week discussed U.S. demands that would require structural change in China to address issues such as IP theft, forced technology transfers and other non-tariff barriers. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will “most likely” visit Washington later in January for trade talks too. In the foreign exchange markets, the dollar was on course for its fourth straight weekly fall against other top world currencies having also hit a three-month low the previous day. The flip side was that the Japanese yen was a shade higher again at 108.29 per dollar and the euro was up at $1.1530 on course for its best week since August. It is China’s yuan that has been the real mover though. Against the backdrop of the sensitive trade negotiations, the Chinese currency has risen 1.8 percent this week which is its biggest gain since July 2005 when Beijing abandoned the yuan’s peg to the dollar. Yuan traders had started offloading dollars in their proprietary accounts on Thursday following the wrap-up of three-day U.S.-China trade talks in Beijing. Markets treated absence of any bad news from those negotiations as good news. “Some corporate clients were joining to sell their dollars,” said a trader at a foreign bank in Shanghai. Bond markets have been turning too. U.S. Treasury debt prices erased early gains after a soft 30-year bond auction and in reaction to Powell’s comments on the Fed “substantially” reducing the size of its balance sheet. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield last stood at 2.728 percent. Crude prices held near four-week highs, lifted by optimism on U.S.-China talks and as OPEC-led crude output cuts started to tighten supply. In early European trade West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 0.9 percent at $53.07 per barrel, the highest level in almost a month. Brent crude futures traded at $62.18 per barrel, up 0.8 percent on the day.

2019-01-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) has completed its 3.9 billion euro (£3.5 billion) project financing, paving the way for construction to be completed for start-up in 2020, its managing director said on Friday. TAP, the final leg of a $40 billion (£31.3 billion) project called the Southern Gas Corridor to transport gas from Central Asia to Western Europe, is a cornerstone of the European Union’s energy security policy to wean the bloc off Russian gas supplies. With the first delivery of gas to Europe expected in 2020, TAP will be the first non-Russian gas pipeline to supply Europe since the Medgaz link, which started deliveries from Algeria to Spain in 2011. TAP will transport up to 10 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas per year from the Shah Deniz II field in Azerbaijan to Italy. “With the financial close now achieved, TAP has reached another major milestone,” said Luca Schieppati, the TAP managing director. “With project financing now concluded, TAP can progress to the final completion of the project and delivery of Shah Deniz II gas in 2020.”  The company said it completed the financial close in December, in what was the largest project finance agreed for a European infrastructure project last year. Last year, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) approved loans for the project. The rest of the financing has come from export credit agencies and a group of 17 commercial banks, which include Bank of China, BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and UniCredit. TAP AG has the option of raising additional finance, for example for increasing the pipeline’s 10 bcm capacity to 20 bcm if demand requires it, said Stephanie Hudson, head of project finance. Schieppati said construction is running according to schedule. “More than 82 percent of construction is done. What we are doing in the construction phase is complying with the high-level environmental and social standards set by the EIB and EBRD,” he added. The project has faced opposition on environmental and political grounds, as well as from local communities in Italy amid fears it will discourage tourism in the south of the country. In October, however, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte gave Italy’s final approval to the project, which had been strongly contested by the 5-Star Movement, one of the two parties in the ruling coalition. TAP AG shareholders are BP (BP.L), SOCAR, Snam (SRG.MI), Fluxys (FLUX.BR), Enagás (ENAG.MC) and Axpo.

2019-01-11,"SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Crisis talks between India’s cash-strapped Jet Airways Ltd (JET.NS) and aircraft lessors have failed to ease a row over late payments, prompting some lessors to explore taking back aircraft, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. In what one of the people described as an ill-tempered showdown between the airline and some of the world’s leading leasing firms, Jet’s main lender State Bank of India (SBI.NS) sought to provide reassurance that India’s biggest full-service carrier is doing all it can to pay its staff, suppliers and creditors. “Jet has been delinquent for many months. Nobody wants to get in a situation where the problems worsen and it becomes even more difficult to take out aircraft,” one of the people said. Jet controls over a sixth of a market experiencing an unprecedented boom in air travel. Yet high fuel taxes, a weak rupee and price competition have squeezed profitability, leaving Jet with 80.52 billion rupees ($1.14 billion) in net debt as at the end of September and defaulting on payments. The airline had previously told some lessors it would clear arrears by Dec. 31, but was unable do so, the people close to the matter said. (For an interactive graphic on India's aviation market, click tmsnrt.rs/2xlWaet) At meetings on Tuesday, held at SBI’s headquarters in Mumbai’s business district, the bank’s Chairman Rajnish Kumar was asked how Jet planned to raise equity or debt, said one of the people - an attendee, who found the responses lacked sufficient detail. Other attendees included Jet’s management team, including the airline’s founder and Chairman Naresh Goyal, as well as a senior adviser of Etihad Airways, which owns 24 percent of Jet and which did not provide any assurances, the person said. An official from Punjab National Bank (PNBK.NS) later said lenders have “in-principle” agreed to extend some help to Jet, but details on the mechanics of it are still being worked out. Some lessors have engaged with lawyers, are working with their technical teams about repossession and are monitoring the planes, but the situation could be complicated by a new bankruptcy law that allows up to 270 days where no action is permitted against the debtor or its assets, the person said. Lessors such as GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) SMBC Aviation Capital and Jackson Square are looking into stopping the transfer of Boeing Co (BA.N) 737 MAX jets that had been due for delivery to Jet, the person said. A second person said deliveries of 737 MAX jets from lessors had been behind schedule since November. Avolon, DAE Aerospace, BOC Aviation Ltd 2558.HK and Aircastle Ltd (AYR.N) also attended the meetings along with GECAS and SMBC, one of the people said, declining to specify which are considering reclaiming planes. Jet Airways, in a statement on Friday, said the airline is working on its turnaround strategy and updating its partners, in real time, on efforts taken to improve its liquidity. “A comprehensive plan that will ensure business sustainability, preserve value, and enable the company to honor its obligations was outlined,” a Jet spokesman said in the statement, adding that the meeting took place in an atmosphere of cordiality and mutual appreciation. The turnaround plan involves creating a competitive cost structure and restructuring the balance sheet, among other things, and is expected to “deliver a positive impact on the financials of the company,” he said.  SBI and SMBC Aviation did not immediately respond to requests for comment. DAE Aerospace, GECAS, Aircastle and Jackson Square did not respond outside of regular business hours. Etihad, BOC Aviation and Avolon declined to comment. The people familiar with the talks were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter and so declined to be identified. Jet, controlled by Goyal, has turned to Etihad for financial help. However, the Abu Dhabi airline is not “in any position to sink new equity into Jet at this juncture,” said a person familiar with Etihad’s position. Etihad posted a “significant loss” at the end of last year that would continue into 2019, according to an internal memo seen by sources on Thursday. The memo also showed 50 pilots would lose their jobs as the airline cut costs. Jet held talks with Indian conglomerate Tata Sons Ltd [TATAS.UL] about financial aid last year. Sources told Reuters that Goyal ended the talks because Tata would have wanted him to step down or take a less prominent role. A source close to Tata on Thursday said there had been no recent engagement with Jet and doing so was “extremely unlikely” because Tata people had “moved on internally”. Tata Sons declined to comment on Friday. After the disorderly collapse of Kingfisher Airlines in 2012, India modified rules in line with the Cape Town convention, an international treaty making it easier for foreign owners to repossess aircraft when airlines default on payments. Lessors can file a complaint with the government which has the power to cancel the registration of a plane within five working days and allow lessors to repossess it subject to certain conditions, including unpaid dues on the aircraft. Some laws conflict with full implementation of the convention and the government in October said it was consulting to revise those laws - a move that could reduce lease rates for Indian carriers. Nevertheless, the ability to repossess a plane can be a more complicated process in India than in some other countries. On Tuesday, Jet proposed to creditors that it would catch up with debt payments in arrears as of September, and from April meet debt payments as they come due, showed a document seen by Reuters. Jet’s debt payments will be large over the next few years, starting with about 17 billion rupees due by March-end, credit-ratings firm ICRA said in a Jan. 2 research note.

2019-01-11,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China could raise average life expectancy by 2.9 years if it improves air quality to levels recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO), according a new study from a U.S. research group. China has vowed to determine the precise impact of air and water pollution on health as part of its efforts to raise average life expectancy to 79 years by 2030 from 76.3 years in 2015.        According to the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), big air quality improvements made in the last five years have already been enough to push up average lifespans. “China is winning its war against pollution ... (The country) is due to see dramatic improvements in the overall health of its people, including longer lifespans, if these improvements are sustained,” EPIC director Michael Greenstone said at an event in Beijing on Thursday. According to the EPIC’s findings, air quality improvements made in the smog-prone northern city of Tianjin over the last five years are already expected to have raised the average lifespan of its 13 million residents by 1.2 years.         China cut average concentrations of hazardous particles known as PM2.5 to an average of 39 micrograms per cubic metre last year, down 9.3 percent from 2017 after a campaign to curb coal use and improve industry and vehicle standards. However, average emission levels remain significantly higher than China’s own 35-microgram standard, as well as the 10-microgram limit recommended by the WHO. In northern industrial regions, average concentrations are much higher. In a study cited by state-owned news agency Xinhua on Friday, a group of top Chinese health experts identified air and water pollution as one of the major health risks in China for the next 20 years, alongside obesity, depression and Alzheimer’s disease. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang declared “war” on pollution in 2014 amid fears that the damage done to the country’s environment as a result of more than 30 years of untrammelled economic growth would lead to social unrest. However, with much of the low-hanging fruit already taken and the economy facing a slowdown, China has admitted that the campaign is under pressure. “It would be very difficult for China to meet the WHO standards even with strong efforts to reduce industrial emissions and fossil fuel consumption,” Jiang Kejun, research professor at the Energy Research Institute, a government think tank, told Reuters on the sidelines of the Thursday event. “Emissions from non-industrial sectors, agriculture for instance, also play a big part in air pollution and are hard to put under control,” he said.

2019-01-11,"MEXICO CITY, Jan 11 (Reuters) - A major fuel pipeline that supplies Mexico City remained closed after suffering two ruptures in a single day, the president said on Friday, as the government works to stem shortages that have frustrated motorists and triggered economic risk. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s offensive against fuel robbers marks the leftist’s first attempt to tackle entrenched corruption since taking office on Dec. 1. Criminal groups have tapped pipelines and stolen tanker trucks carrying diesel and gasoline in the oil-producing country for years, costing the government billions of dollars. A key pipeline running from the port of Tuxpan in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz to Mexico City was shut down on Thursday night and repairs were underway, Lopez Obrador said on Friday. The pipeline was hit at daybreak on Thursday and repaired, only to suffer another rupture at 11 p.m., he said. “There’s sabotage,” he said. “Let’s see who gets tired first.” The series of disruptions to the pipeline in recent days had caused shortfalls in supply for Mexico City and surrounding states. Cars lined up by the dozen at stations throughout the capital on Friday, many before dawn, fearing that the shortages that fanned into the megacity this week from nearby states could persist. Local television showed angry protesters blocking a major roadway in Mexico City’s Iztapalapa neighborhood. The head of Mexico’s central bank said on Thursday that the country’s economy and inflation rate could be negatively affected if fuel distribution problems persist. The closure of a pipeline from the Salamanca refinery in the central state of Guanajuato last weekend cut off supply for numerous gas stations. Lopez Obrador later said the military had discovered a 3-kilometer (1.9 mile)-long “hose” that was funneling fuel out of storage tanks from the facility to a secret storage area. The president also confirmed some congestion at key ports where imported motor fuels arrive, noting that some tanker ships were awaiting to discharge cargos, but he did not provide details. Bottlenecks at Mexico’s main Gulf coast and Pacific coast ports have increased during this week, and now prevent almost 10 million barrels of gasoline and diesel from discharging on schedule, further complicating distribution, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. On Tuesday, 24 vessels were backed up at ports, while that number has grown to 39 by Friday. Six tankers loaded with liquefied petroleum gas, used mostly for heating, are also waiting to discharge.

2019-01-11,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell nearly 2 percent on Friday as investors worried about a global economic slowdown, snapping a nine-day winning streak spurred by U.S.-China trade hopes, but clung to some gains from that rally to end the week higher.  Brent crude futures LCOc1 dropped $1.2 to settle at $60.48 a barrel, a 1.95 percent loss. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were down $1 to settle at $51.59 a barrel, or 1.9 percent. Still, both benchmarks saw their second week of gains, with Brent rising about 6 percent and WTI up about 7.6 percent.  The global crude benchmark on Thursday posted its first consecutive nine-day rally since September 2007. WTI, which also hit its ninth straight day of gains, beat a 2010 record. Rising expectations that an all-out trade war between Washington and Beijing might be averted supported markets earlier in the week. Three days of talks between the two economic superpowers concluded on Wednesday with no concrete announcements, but higher-level discussions may convene later this month. “After a number of days higher, the market is just taking a breather,” said Tony Headrick, an energy market analyst at St. Paul, Minnesota commodity brokerage CHS Hedging LLC.  Market participants remained cautious about a slew of recent economic data that has raised concerns about a global economic slowdown.  China plans to set a lower economic growth target of 6-6.5 percent in 2019 compared with last year’s target of “around” 6.5 percent, policy sources told Reuters, as Beijing gears up to cope with higher U.S. tariffs and weakening domestic demand.   “If we experience an economic slowdown, crude will underperform due to its correlation to growth,” said Hue Frame, portfolio manager at Frame Funds in Sydney. On the supply side, oil markets have received support from supply cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC members including Russia. The deal is aimed at shrinking a glut that emerged in the second half of 2018. Russia has reduced its oil production to 11.38 million barrels per day (bpd) on average on Jan. 1-10 from a record high of 11.45 million bpd last month, a source familiar with the data told Reuters on Friday. Lower oil exports from Iran since November, when U.S. resumed sanctions against the OPEC producer, have also supported crude.  Playing a key part in the emerging glut was the United States, where crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA has soared to a record 11.7 million barrels per day. Consultancy JBC Energy this week said it was likely that U.S. crude production was “significantly above 12 million bpd” by this month. U.S. energy firms, however, this week cut four oil rigs, the second week of declines, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said, as producers turned conservative in their 2019 drilling plans due to uncertainty over a recovery in crude prices.

2019-01-11,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has launched the most sweeping attack against rampant corruption and organised crime of his young administration: aiming to stop a growing fuel theft racket that has grown dramatically in recent years. The new leader is seeking to stem the theft from key pipelines that transport fuel, but the effort to re-route distribution via trucks has provoked long lines at gas stations while threatening to crimp the economy and damage his popularity if shortages persist. Since last month, veteran leftist Lopez Obrador has ordered the closure of six major pipelines especially vulnerable to illegal taps where criminal gangs and other thieves have siphoned off stolen fuel worth billions of dollars. The new president, who took office in December, won a landslide election victory on promises to root out endemic corruption, strengthen ailing national oil company Pemex and ensure stable fuel prices. Mexico’s fast-growing motor fuel market is a juicy target for thieves. It is the world’s sixth biggest, according to energy ministry data, featuring a total daily demand of nearly 1.18 million barrels of gasoline and diesel. The Mexican government’s lack of attention has allowed organised groups to open clandestine taps along Pemex’s main pipelines. Internal complicity at Pemex refineries and terminals have also opened the door for theft of entire trucks loaded with fuel.  Fuel stolen from Pemex’s infrastructure mostly ends in the hands of the same retailers that legally sell Pemex gasoline and diesel. Fuel theft has been a problem in Mexico for decades but it has been growing in recent years. The crackdown on the drug war has caused gangs to turn to other forms of theft, and the nation’s network of pipelines proved to be ripe targets.  Theft escalated in recent years following reforms to the country’s oil sector by previous president Enrique Pena Nieto, who liberalized the industry for foreign investment. In turn, retail prices rose, giving cartels an opportunity to undercut those prices through black-market sales of gasoline. Thieves tap into pipelines and are currently siphoning off the equivalent of around one-fifth of total national gasoline consumption, about 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) according to Reuters calculations based on official data. They then re-sell mostly to complicit gas stations.  Pemex documented more than 12,500 illegal taps to its fuel pipeline network during the first 10 months of 2018, more than in the previous year. The widespread theft costs Pemex more than $3 billion annually, according to official numbers. Lopez Obrador has said upwards of 80 percent of the theft is organised by Pemex employees, though he has not provided evidence. He has also pointed to reports that the union has been restricting access to parts of the company’s operations.     Central and western states including Queretaro, Guanajuato, Hidalgo, Michoacan and Jalisco are most afflicted by the pipeline theft, as well as Pemex’s Salamanca refinery, which has been especially plagued by organised crime and violent disruptions. For years, Pemex’s six domestic oil refineries have operated well bellow their capacity, due to a mix of underinvestment, deferred maintenance and frequent accidents, including deadly explosions that have provoked costly stoppages. Las year, the refineries operated at about a third of their 1.63-million-barrel-per day crude processing capacity, compared with 2013, when they processed nearly 1.4 million barrels of crude a day.  Pemex gasoline output falls as imports rise : tmsnrt.rs/2AEK0fQ Mexico has grown increasingly dependent on fuel imports in recent years, with imported gasoline, distillates and liquefied petroleum gas growing last year to about two-thirds of total demand. In 2016, imports and domestic production each accounted for roughly half.  Mexico has 16 marine terminals capable of receiving imported fuel, plus 74 storage facilities and over 8,800 kilometres of pipelines. The imports flow mainly through the Pajaritos, Tuxpan and Veracruz terminals on the country’s Gulf coast, which have recently turned into bottlenecks for the imports.  Mexico is a critical export market for U.S. refiners and trading firms, and is the biggest buyer of U.S. gasoline and diesel. In October, the United States exported 621,000 bpd of gasoline to Mexico, accounting for roughly 60 percent of the 1.03 million bpd exported that month, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).  While the volumes are much lower than supplies transported by sea, rail shipments of fuels across the U.S.-Mexico land border have also grown substantially as U.S. firms have capitalized on Mexico’s growing demand, hitting record highs several times since early 2017, according to data from the Association of American Railroads, the largest U.S. rail trade group. The new government began the closure of major fuel pipelines on December 27. Production at Pemex’s Gulf coast Madero and Minatitlan refineries has also been partially or completely halted, which contributes to the need for imported fuels as a replacement.  Lopez Obrador hopes some 5,000 tanker trucks can distribute supplies to over 11,000 gas stations scattered across the country. While the vast majority of the stations are Pemex franchises, a growing number belong to new private entrants, including giant ExxonMobil and trading firm Glencore, which in some cases import their own fuel.  The cost of transporting gasoline and diesel by tanker trucks is nearly 14 times more expensive than via pipelines, according to a study by Mexico’s Federal Commission for Economic Competition, or Cofece. Both Pemex and Lopez Obrador have sought to assure an increasingly restless public that there is plenty of gasoline and that refineries and other key installations are being supervised by 4,000 soldiers. He has also pleaded with citizens to be patient while the new distribution system is normalized. Lopez Obrador’s team has yet to explain how it will finance the much more expensive distribution costs it is now incurring.

2019-01-11,"ADEN (Reuters) - Civil defence forces in Yemen’s port city of Aden fought to extinguish a fire at an oil refinery on Friday, sparked hours earlier by an explosion, the cause of which was still unknown, the refinery company said.  There were no reports of casualties.   Separately, Saudi state television reported that the Saudi-led military coalition fighting the Iran-allied Houthi group  had destroyed a communication and control centre the Houthis used to direct their unmanned aircraft. It did not give further details.  A day earlier the Houthis launched a drone attack on a military parade in Lahaj, a province next to Aden, killing several people. Aden is under the control of an internationally recognised government, which, backed by a Saudi-led and U.S.-backed coalition, is fighting a nearly four-year-old war against the Houthis.  The Houthis said in November they were halting drone and missile attacks on Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and their Yemeni allies, but tensions have risen recently over how to implement a United Nations-sponsored deal in Hodeidah. The Houthis and the government agreed at peace talks in Sweden in December to stop fighting in the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah and withdraw forces following months of diplomacy and Western pressure. But implementation of the deal, the first breakthrough in peace efforts in five years, has stalled as the sides disagree on who will control Hodeidah after the withdrawal. The U.S. State Department condemned Thursday’s attack and called for restraint from all sides. “This attack contravenes the spirit of the (Hodeidah) ceasefire and the progress made last month at the U.N.-led talks in Sweden,” deputy spokesman Robert Palladino said in a statement.

2019-01-11,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will try to protect German and European companies from some potentially “massive collateral damage” if Washington levies further sanctions against Russia, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Friday. Maas, speaking on Friday at a new year reception of the German Committee on East European Economic Relations, an industry group, said he expected the newly elected U.S. congress to move swiftly to bring new sanctions against Moscow. “Our aim is to reach agreement (with the U.S. on sanctions) and protect German and European companies from the in some cases massive collateral damage,” he said.  He did not give further details but his remarks are likely to cheer German exporters hard hit by European Union and U.S. sanctions imposed after Moscow invaded and annexed parts of Ukraine in 2014.     Washington has led the way in demanding tougher measures against Moscow, while Germany, which has deep trade ties with Russia and depends on it for much of its imported gas, has been far more cautious. “For us sanctions ... only make sense when, as with the EU’s sanctions, they are tied to clear, fulfillable conditions,” said Maas, in an apparent softening of his more hawkish tone on Russia when he took office last year. “Sadly, that is no longer the case for U.S. sanctions.” Earlier, the industry group’s chairman Wolfgang Buechele had criticized the U.S. sanctions for being too vague and unclear for German exporters to adhere to, pleading for German government backing if they were further tightened. The EU last month extended for a further six months sanctions targeting Russia’s financial, energy and defense sectors. They were originally imposed in July 2014 after Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula. The U.S. expanded its sanctions in December, adding 15 members of Russian military intelligence and four entities involved in alleged election interference to a blacklist that allows for their assets to be frozen. The new Democrat majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, incensed by allegations of collaboration between President Donald Trump’s campaign team and Russian lobbyists, is preparing congressional hearings on Trump’s alleged Russia ties. A particular focus of both their and Trump’s ire is the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, by supplying Germany with Russian gas directly under the Baltic Sea, will cut Ukraine out of lucrative transit fees even as it fends off a Russian-backed insurrection in its east. But Maas said he had told U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that sanctions targeting Nord Stream 2 would not be appropriate. “(Russian President Vladimir) Putin agreed last year to continue gas transit through Ukraine,” he said. “Nord Stream 2 isn’t Germany and Russia going it alone.

2019-01-11,"Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms cut oil rigs for a second week in a row as more producers, like Occidental Petroleum Corp, turned conservative in their 2019 drilling plans due to uncertainty over a recovery in crude prices. Drillers cut four oil rigs in the week to Jan. 11, bringing the total count down to 873, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still much higher than a year ago when 752 rigs were active after energy companies boosted spending in 2018 to capture higher prices that year. Occidental, one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin, the biggest U.S. oil field, said on Monday it expected to spend $4.4 billion to $5.3 billion this year, compared with around $5 billion spent in 2018, depending on the price of crude oil. Shale producers said they expect to reduce their drilling activity in 2019 following a near 40 percent decline in crude prices during the last quarter of 2018 and mounting fears of global oversupply. If correct, that would be the first decline in the rig count in three years after drillers added 138 oil rigs in 2018 and 222 in 2017. They cut 11 rigs in 2016. Those past rig increases helped boost U.S. oil production to a projected all-time high of 10.9 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018, according to federal estimates, topping the current record of 9.6 million bpd in 1970. Official data for 2018 is not yet available. U.S. crude futures were trading nearly 2 percent lower at below $52 a barrel on Friday, but set for their second straight weekly gains on hopes the United States and China may soon resolve their trade dispute, which should boost global demand. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading around $53 a barrel for the balance of 2019 and above $54 for calendar 2020. Spot crude prices at the U.S. West Texas Intermediate WTC- benchmark averaged $65.23 in 2018. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided mixed guidance for 2019 after indicating they would spend about $88.7 billion in 2018, a 23 percent increase over the $72.2 billion they spent in 2017. Cowen said the firms it tracks, like Antero Resources Corp , were so far only expecting to add nine rigs this year. Antero this week announced a 2019 drilling and completion budget of $1.1-$1.25 billion, down about 15 percent from 2018, according to Cowen. There were 1,075 oil and natural gas rigs active in the United States this week, according to Baker Hughes. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and gas rig count will fall from 1,032 in 2018 to 999 in 2019 before rising to 1,087 in 2020. That is a slight reduction in Simmons forecast from last week of 1,001 rigs in 2019 and 1,094 in 2020. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2019-01-11,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices fell for the first time in nine months in December amid a plunge in gasoline prices, but underlying inflation pressures remained firm as rental housing and healthcare costs rose steadily. Overall, the report from the Labor Department on Friday painted a picture of inflation that was under control, with increases in some categories offset by declines elsewhere. This likely supports recent statements by Federal Reserve officials pledging patience in raising interest rates this year. “The Fed will take this as further proof that price pressures are building more slowly than some have feared based on the strong growth of late and tight labor market,” said James McCann, senior global economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Boston. “It certainly seems to justify the Fed’s message about being more patient on rate increases.” The Consumer Price Index dipped 0.1 percent last month, the first drop and weakest reading since March, after being unchanged in November. In the 12 months through December, the CPI rose 1.9 percent, slowing from November’s 2.2 percent gain. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI increased 0.2 percent, advancing by the same margin for a third straight month. In the 12 months through December, the so-called core CPI rose 2.2 percent, matching November’s increase. December’s inflation readings were in line with economists’ expectations. The CPI rose 1.9 percent in 2018, slowing from a 2.1 percent increase in 2017. But the core CPI jumped 2.2 percent, up from 1.8 percent in 2017. The Fed, which has a 2 percent inflation target, tracks a different measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, for monetary policy.  The core PCE price index increased 1.9 percent year-on-year in November after rising 1.8 percent in October. It hit 2 percent in March for the first time since April 2012. The U.S. central bank has forecast two interest rate hikes this year, but several policymakers, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have said they would be cautious about tightening monetary policy.  Powell reiterated that view on Thursday, saying “especially with inflation low and under control we have the ability to be patient and watch patiently and carefully” while the central bank monitored economic data and financial markets for risks to growth. Minutes of the U.S. central bank’s Dec. 18-19 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed “many” officials were of the view that the Fed “could afford to be patient about further policy firming.” But with core inflation remaining firm despite a strong dollar and slowing global growth, economists say further rate increases this year cannot be ruled out. In addition, a tighter labor market is boosting wage growth.  “If core inflation holds firm, the Fed will continue to consider additional rate hikes this year,” said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Fed lifted borrowing costs four times in 2018. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower after a five-day rally. Low inflation is boosting households’ purchasing power, which could keep consumer spending supported. While the economy likely posted strong growth in the fourth quarter, an ongoing partial shutdown of the federal government is casting a cloud on the economy.  The partial closure started on Dec. 22 as President Donald Trump demanded that the U.S. Congress give him $5.7 billion this year to help build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. According to JPMorgan the shutdown, which has left 800,000 employees furloughed or working without pay and delayed the release of data from the Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis, was subtracting 0.1-0.2 percentage point from quarterly gross domestic product growth each week. Inflation-adjusted average weekly earnings surged 0.7 percent in December, the biggest gain since August 2015, after slipping 0.1 percent in November. Weekly earnings increased 1.2 percent in the 12 months to December, the most since July 2016, from 0.6 percent in November.  Last month, gasoline prices dropped 7.5 percent, the largest decrease since February 2016, after tumbling 4.2 percent in November. But Americans paid more for food, with prices rising 0.4 percent. That was the biggest gain since May 2014 and followed a 0.2 percent rise in November.  Owners’ equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, advanced 0.2 percent in December after rising 0.3 percent in November. Healthcare costs increased 0.3 percent last month after jumping 0.4 percent in November.  Apparel prices were unchanged in December after dropping 0.9 percent in the prior month. Airline fares tumbled 1.5 percent and prices for used motor vehicles and trucks fell 0.2 percent after rising for two straight months.  But prices for household furnishings increased, likely because of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on a range of imported Chinese goods. New motor vehicle prices were unchanged for a second straight month.

2019-01-11,"* Wall St rally pauses as investors await corporate earnings * Oil down but set for weekly gain * Dollar rises vs euro * Treasury prices gain on weakness in stocks By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed NEW YORK, Jan 11 (Reuters) - An index of world stock markets eased on Friday after a five-day winning streak, as a rally fueled by hopes that Sino-U.S. trade tensions will ease and that the U.S. central bank will be patient on monetary policy took a breather. The weakness in stocks and data showing a decline in consumer prices during December supported U.S. Treasury prices. MSCI’s all-country index, was down 0.22 percent. For the week, the index was up 2.7 percent, on pace for its best weekly gain in six weeks. Stocks have rallied this week, helped by promises of patience from the Federal Reserve, the ECB mulling more cheap money and trade talks between Washington and Beijing moving to higher levels. On Friday, U.S. stocks retreated amid broad-based declines as investors pocketed some profits and reset positions ahead of the earnings season. The pause comes after a strong start to 2019, which lifted the S&P 500 by more than 10 percent from a 20-month low it touched around Christmas. With big U.S. banks kicking off fourth-quarter earnings next week, investors will comb through earnings reports and projections for signs of a slowdown in economic growth. “We’ve run up and people seem to be in a wait-and-watch mode before they put more money back in,” said Mark Grant, chief global strategist at B. Riley FBR Inc. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 107.61 points, or 0.45 percent, to 23,894.31, the S&P 500 lost 9.62 points, or 0.37 percent, to 2,587.02 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 41.18 points, or 0.59 percent, to 6,944.89. The pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark was up -0.01 percent. Treasury prices rose, helped by the weakness in stocks and as data showed U.S. consumer prices fell for the first time in nine months in December. “Stocks are a little weaker. They really have dictated the direction of Treasury trading for a while now,” said Thomas Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies in New York. Benchmark 10-year notes gained 11/32 in price to yield 2.6936 percent, down from 2.731 percent late Thursday. In currency markets, the dollar rose against the euro, boosted by technical factors after the euro hit key resistance levels. The euro was down 0.28 percent against the dollar at $1.1466. The single currency is up 0.7 percent for the week. China’s onshore yuan finished the domestic session at 6.7482 per dollar, up 1.8 percent this week in its biggest gain since July 2005, when Beijing abandoned the yuan’s peg to the dollar. In commodities, oil prices fell but were on track for weekly gains after financial markets strengthened on hopes the United States and China may soon resolve their trade dispute. Brent crude was down 1.54 percent, or $0.95, to $60.73 per barrel. U.S. crude was at $51.78 per barrel, down $0.81 or 1.54 percent. Gold rose on Friday, on pace for a fourth straight weekly gain, as expectations grew that brakes could soon be applied to U.S. interest rates, boosting the allure of the non-yielding metal. Spot gold rose 0.24 percent to $1,289.36 per ounce. Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed;         Editing by Dan

2019-01-11,"(Adds Exxon declining to comment) By Neil Marks GEORGETOWN, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Seismic research vessels hired by Exxon Mobil to explore for oil off Guyana’s coast have not returned to the site of a December incident with Venezuela’s navy, but they may in the future, Guyana’s foreign minister said on Thursday. Guyana, with no history of oil production, has become the focus of intense interest since Exxon announced the discovery of over 5 billion barrels of oil and gas off its shores. That has reignited a century-old territorial dispute with neighboring Venezuela. OPEC-member Venezuela’s crude output is near its lowest levels in 70 years amid an economic crisis. In a speech at a trade union forum in the capital Georgetown, Foreign Minister Carl Greenidge said the Dec. 22 incident when the ships complied with Venezuela’s order to turn around - which both countries say took place within their territorial waters - would not necessarily hold back future exploration. “They haven’t returned to the area. It doesn’t mean they can’t return in the future,” Greenidge said. “We’re not speaking in absolutes here.” Other oil companies, including Spain’s Repsol SA, are active in offshore Guyana. Greenidge said Chevron Corp had applied for a government license, without providing further detail. Chevron does not comment on specific business opportunities, a spokeswoman said. According to a notice posted on Guyana’s Maritime Administration Department’s website before the incident, the ships’ activities were expected to begin on Dec. 6, 2018, and conclude on Dec. 31. No new notice has been posted. Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Greenidge’s statements. In a press conference on Wednesday, socialist President Nicolas Maduro praised the armed forces for intercepting the ships, noting that if it were not for their patrol, “one day we would get there and they would be taking oil.” “Is a world like that viable, without respect for international law?” Maduro said. Exxon declined to comment.

2019-01-11,"* Powell says Fed can be patient as U.S. economy evolves in 2019 * U.S. expects China’s top trade negotiator to visit likely in Jan * Dollar rebounds from 3-mth low, Wall St shares end higher By Tomo Uetake TOKYO, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Asian stocks inched higher to one-month highs on Friday, after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated the U.S. central bank can be patient on raising interest rates further. But the rally’s momentum slowed partly as investors sought more clarity on whether the United States and China could make headway on their talks on trade as well as intellectual property (IP) rights. U.S. President Donald Trump had earlier on Thursday said that Washington was having “tremendous success” in its trade negotiations with China. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged 0.2 percent higher, while Japan’s benchmark Nikkei advanced 1.1 percent in early trade. Wall Street extended its rally into a fifth straight day on Thursday in a whipsaw trading session as investors responded to mixed comments by Powell, while a warning from Macy’s pummelled retail stocks. At the Economic Club of Washington, Powell reiterated the views of other policymakers that the Fed would be patient about interest rate hikes. Major U.S. stock indexes also quickly recovered from brief losses after Powell said that the Fed’s balance sheet would be “substantially smaller”. “The word ‘patient’ is used often when the Fed’s policy direction is still tightening but its next rate hike can wait for a considerable time. So risk assets now enjoy support from what we can call Powell put,” said Tomoaki Shishido, economist at Nomura Securities. “Similarly, Trump also softened his stance on China after sharp falls in stock prices. He has offered an olive branch to China and there’s no reason China would not want to accept it,” he said. U.S. and Chinese officials are working on arrangements for higher-level trade talks after mid-level officials this week discussed U.S. demands on issues that would require structural change in China to address issues such as IP theft, forced technology transfers and other non-tariff barriers. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said late on Thursday that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will “most likely” visit Washington later in January for trade talks. In the foreign exchange markets, the dollar rebounded after hitting three-month lows against major currencies. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six of its peers, rallied from its three-month low, after the Powell comments. The euro last traded at $1.1515, while the dollar fetched 108.39 yen. U.S. Treasury debt prices erased early gains after a soft 30-year bond auction and in reaction to Powell’s comments on the Fed “substantially” reducing the size of its balance sheet. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield last stood at 2.737 percent. Crude prices held near one-month highs, but a more than week-long in oil rally slowed as optimism surrounding U.S.-China trade talks faded a little. In early Asian trade, West Texas Intermediate crude futures slipped 0.7 percent to $52.23 per barrel.

2019-01-11,"SINGAPORE, Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices edged down on Friday as concerns over economic growth were rekindled after talks fell short of offering concrete steps to end the Sino-U.S. trade conflict, although OPEC-led production cuts bolstered sentiment in crude markets. Oil prices were also supported by comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday that the central bank had the ability to be patient on monetary policy. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures had slipped 23 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last settlement to $52.36 per barrel by 0016 GMT. However, U.S. crude was on track for a second consecutive week of gains and its largest weekly percentage increase in more than two years. WTI has climbed about 9 percent so far this week, its biggest weekly rise since December, 2016. International Brent crude futures had yet to trade. China said three days of talks with the United States that wrapped up on Wednesday had established a “foundation” to resolve differences over trade. But it gave few details on key issues at stake, including a scheduled U.S. tariff increase on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. A partial U.S. government shutdown and tepid economic data in some countries also dragged on broad financial markets. “The U.S. government shutdown and weak retail sales figures around the world reinvigorated concerns about (economic) growth,” analysts at ANZ bank said in a note on Friday. China’s producer prices in December rose at their slowest pace in more than two years, a worrying sign of deflationary risks that could see Beijing roll out more policy support to help stabilise the economy. “However, investors are becoming increasingly confident that OPEC+ production cuts will balance the market,” ANZ said. Saudi Arabia said earlier this week that supply curbs started in late 2018 by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producers including Russia, would bring the oil market into balance. “Saudi is turning the screws on export supply in order to re-balance the market in their favour. Prices are maintaining highs which suggests that the recent bullish move is not yet over,” said Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Probis Securities in Sydney. “We expect more bullish rhetoric from OPEC, especially from Saudi Arabia to help shore up the prices. U.S. producers will just enjoy the rise.” The likelihood of supply curbs elsewhere also helped buoy oil markets. Norway’s oil industry regulator said the country’s crude output in 2019 would be smaller than previously forecast and at its lowest level in three decades. Meanwhile, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Thursday U.S. sanctions against his country were “fully illegal” and Tehran would not comply with them.

2019-01-11,"LONDON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Iran will see its crude exports severely curtailed for a third month in January as it is struggling to find new buyers amid fresh U.S. sanctions even though its traditional customers secured waivers, according to tanker data and industry sources. Iran’s crude exports in November plummeted to below 1 million barrels per day, from regular sales of 2.5 million bpd before sanctions were imposed in May, and taking them back to where they stood during the previous round of sanctions in 2012-2016. Buyers said plunging exports in November, which will severely hit the Islamic Republic’s budget revenues, were caused by a total lack of clarity of what volumes they were allowed to purchase under the new U.S. sanctions. Washington later gave a fairly generous set of waivers to eight traditional Iranian oil buyers - including China, India, Japan and South Korea - to avoid a rally in oil prices, but the measure has failed to give a meaningful boost to exports. According to tanker data and industry sources, Iran’s crude shipments remained below 1 million bpd in December and are unlikely to exceed that level in January despite rising month-on-month. “In January, I expect a slight uptick in the second half of the month with some Asian lifting resuming,” one of the sources said. “For the time being, I am pencilling in around 900,000 bpd for January.” Regular buyer Taiwan said last year it was not yet buying Iranian oil despite receiving a waiver because of a lack of a clear payment mechanism. Iran has said its exports have not declined as much as estimated by the industry because it was selling oil to new buyers. But it declined to disclose them because of a fear of new sanctions. A restrained level of Iranian shipments would assist the new global push to cut oil supply in 2019 led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, from which Iran is exempt, and lend support to oil prices. “We are forecasting slightly more than December, but not massive,” said a source at another company that monitors Iranian shipments, putting the month-on-month rise at below 50,000 bpd. Iranian exports are higher if condensate, a type of light oil, is counted as well as crude. Kpler, another company that tracks oil flows, put Iranian crude and condensate exports at 1.35 million bpd in December. Tracking Iranian exports has become harder since the sanctions began as ships switch off tracking systems, industry sources say, keeping some of the shipments hidden. According to Refinitiv Eikon data, shipments including condensate plunged to about 650,000 bpd in December, although such figures are probably not counting all the tankers that switch off their AIS tracking signal. Some buyers that stayed away in November are returning. Turkey has resumed imports of Iranian oil after a one-month hiatus in November, Reuters reported on Tuesday, at a volume less than half of the pre-sanctions amount. Shipments were at least 2.5 million bpd in April, the month before U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and reimposed sanctions. Tehran has vowed to keep exporting oil despite the U.S. effort to reduce its shipments to zero. Graphic by Amanda Cooper

2019-01-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - By the end of last year, hedge fund positions in diesel had fallen to a level normally associated with a sharp slowdown in economic growth if not an outright recession. Most middle distillate fuels such as diesel, gasoil and jet fuel are consumed in freight transport (ships, trucks, railroads and air cargo) as well as manufacturing and mining. Middle distillate consumption and prices are therefore more closely tied to the state of the economy than other refined fuels such as gasoline. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2HjMiXV) For the last 25 years, hedge funds and other speculators, collectively termed “non-commercial traders”, have mostly held a net long or bullish position in distillate futures and options. The typical net long position reflects the overall expansion of the U.S. and global economies (expansions have been long while recessions have been relatively short). In most cases, when non-commercial traders have switched to a substantial net short or bearish position the economy has been experiencing a sharp slowdown or is already in recession. Large net short positions in 1995, 1998, 2002, 2010 and 2015 were all associated with slowdowns or recessions according to contemporary statements or minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee. The exception was the net short position at the end of 2004, which came six months after the Fed noted a “soft patch” in the expansion, by which time the economy was improving enough for the Fed to raise interest rates again. Crucially, not all these episodes ended in a recession; some were transient slowdowns in an uninterrupted expansion. But given this history, the large liquidation of speculative long positions in diesel futures during the fourth quarter of 2018 was consistent with a substantial deterioration in the economic outlook. Non-commercial traders started 2018 with a record bullish position in U.S. diesel futures equivalent to 64 million barrels of fuel, with more bullish positions held in options and European derivatives such as gasoil. At the start of the fourth quarter, they still held a very large net long position equivalent to almost 48 million barrels, suggesting most speculators continued to anticipate a strong economic expansion. But the net long position had disappeared by the end of November and turned into a net short of 8 million barrels by the middle of December, coinciding with the slump in equity markets and fears about the economic outlook. Unfortunately, there is no more recent data on non-commercial positions because of the partial shutdown of the U.S. federal government. By the middle of December, the net short position was not yet at a level signalling a slowdown or recession, but the trend was clear. The fall in non-commercial diesel positions was consistent with other indicators of slackening economic activity including the decline in equity prices, yield curve inversion, business surveys and slowing freight growth. At the end of 2018, the distillate market, like other financial markets and the economy, was balanced uncertainly on the brink of a slowdown. What happens next depends critically on whether the U.S. and global economies accelerate again, settle into an extended soft patch, or slump into recession. If the rate of economic expansion quickens again, hedge funds and other speculators will close some of their short positions and rebuild a significant net long position, exerting upward pressure on diesel and crude prices. The process may already have started in recent days as traders become more optimistic the United States and China will reach an agreement, or at least a truce, in their trade war. But if the economy settles into a more sluggish phase, or stalls and slips into recession, further hedge fund selling will put renewed downward pressure on diesel and crude.

2019-01-11,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Any attempts by the United States to stop Europe buying Russian gas via additional sanctions against Moscow would be an attack on the continent’s sovereignty, a German business group said on Friday. The United States has threatened, but not so far levied, sanctions against European companies participating in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is being built by a consortium led by Russian state gas giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM). The pipeline, which would carry gas straight to Germany under the Baltic Sea, is driving a wedge between Germany and its allies as it would deprive Ukraine of the lucrative gas transit fees it currently enjoys. “If the U.S. decided to sanction the use of Russian gas, that would be an attack on German and European sovereignty,” Wolfgang Buechele, chairman of the German Committee on East European Economic Relations, told a new year news conference. Any move in that direction should draw a sharp response from Berlin, he said. “I believe the Nord Stream 2 project is in the pure interests of not just Germany but also of Europe,” Buechele said of the pipeline, which would feed into Europe-wide gas transmission networks. The German Committee on East European Economic Relations is an umbrella group representing German firms doing business in Eastern Europe. Nord Stream 2 has also divided Germany’s political class. Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, bound by friendship to Russian President Vladimir Putin, has senior roles in the Nord Stream 2 holding company as well as at state-owned energy firms Gazprom (GAZP.MM) and Rosneft (ROSN.MM). Others, especially in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats, are notably cooler on the project, which, though owned by Gazprom, numbers German energy company Uniper (UN01.DE) and BASF-owned (BASFn.DE) oil company Wintershall [WINT.UL] among its financial investors. Buechele said Europe had no alternative to Russian gas, adding that the liquefied natural gas that Washington has touted as an alternative was both more expensive and more harmful to the environment. “We need these resources in the long term,” he said. Germany’s manufacturing sector is heavily reliant on exports to Russia and was hard hit hard by EU and U.S. sanctions levied after Russia invaded and annexed parts of neighboring Ukraine, and again after U.S. sanctions were ratcheted up late last year. The committee said it expected trade with Russia to stagnate this year - even as trade with neighboring Poland, with less than a third the population, reached a record high of 120 billion euros ($138 billion) last year, twice the volume of Germany’s Russia trade.

Equity funds drew inflows of $6.2 billion, their biggest in 11 weeks, Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists said on Friday, citing data from EPFR on flows in the week to Jan. 9. Some $7.2 billion flowed into bond funds, the biggest taking in 39 weeks. BAML’s “Bull/Bear” gauge of investor positioning fell to 1.8 last week, what the strategists called “extreme bear territory”, triggering a “buy” signal for equities. “Initial skepticism on size and duration of rally... quickly morphed into chase via stocks in EM and U.S. but not Europe,” BAML strategists wrote, commenting on feedback from clients after the signal. The gauge crawled back up to 2.2, or “neutral” territory, this week. In the U.S., growth stocks and large-cap stocks drew the biggest inflows with $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion respectively, while $700 million evaporated from value stocks. Comments from Powell stressing that the U.S. central bank can be patient in approving any further rate increases have triggered relief among investors who were fretting continued rate rises may be a mistake. In another sign of healthy risk appetite, emerging market assets were popular with both equity and bond funds drawing in $2.4 billion, while high-yield bond funds received $1.5 billion inflows. Europe remained unpopular with $100 million outflows. European equity funds have suffered outflows in 43 of the past 44 weeks. In sectors, investors pulled $600 million from tech stocks and $1.5 billion from financials stocks. They also dumped $1.4 billion of investment-grade bonds. What could sustain the risk rally is inflows to credit funds, strategists said. These would signal that the Fed “has short-circuited vicious cycle of higher credit spreads and weaker growth”, they wrote. “Green shoots” from Asian or European macroeconomic data would also help support further gains, they added. European stocks climbed to a one-month high on Friday and eyed their fourth straight day of gains, which would be their longest winning streak since November.

With more promises of patience from Federal Reserve, the ECB mulling another dump of cheap money and news that trade talks between Washington and Beijing are moving to higher levels, the Friday feeling was in full effect. Asia had crawled to a 5-week high overnight thanks to China and Japan, and European stocks were up for what could be the fourth straight day of gains and longest winning streak since September. The Fed’s dovish stance also pushed down the dollar and nudged Treasury yields lower after five days of gains again. That cheered emerging markets and confidence more generally having been flattened during the brutal end to 2018. “Equities are having a good run after a pretty horrible end to last year,” said Rabobank quantitative analyst Bas Van Geffen. “It is the changing wording of the Fed, it seems to be making more and more room for an eventual pause (in the rate hike cycle)”. The index of Europe’s leading 300 shares was up 0.3 percent in early trade at 1377 points, its highest in almost a month. Germany’s DAX was up 0.1 percent and France’s CAC was up 0.2 percent at 4814 points. The big gainer among Europe’s leading indices was Britain’s FTSE, up 0.7 percent at 6992 points on the back of the latest slide in sterling against the euro on mounting Brexit uncertainty. Wall Street’s strong performance on Thursday was another positive driver. The S&P 500 is now up more than 10 percent from its Dec. 26 low, and futures point to another rise at the open on Friday. At the Economic Club of Washington on Thursday, Fed chief Jerome Powell reiterated the U.S. central bank would be patient about hiking interest rates. “The word ‘patient’ is used often when the Fed’s policy direction is still tightening but its next rate hike can wait for a considerable time. So risk assets now enjoy support from what we can call Powell put,” said Tomoaki Shishido, economist at Nomura Securities. “Similarly, Trump also softened his stance on China after sharp falls in stock prices.

U.S. and Chinese officials are working on arrangements for higher-level trade talks after mid-level officials this week discussed U.S. demands that would require structural change in China to address issues such as IP theft, forced technology transfers and other non-tariff barriers. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will “most likely” visit Washington later in January for trade talks too. In the foreign exchange markets, the dollar was on course for its fourth straight weekly fall against other top world currencies having also hit a three-month low the previous day. The flip side was that the Japanese yen was a shade higher again at 108.29 per dollar and the euro was up at $1.1530 on course for its best week since August. It is China’s yuan that has been the real mover though. Against the backdrop of the sensitive trade negotiations, the Chinese currency has risen 1.8 percent this week which is its biggest gain since July 2005 when Beijing abandoned the yuan’s peg to the dollar. Yuan traders had started offloading dollars in their proprietary accounts on Thursday following the wrap-up of three-day U.S.-China trade talks in Beijing. Markets treated absence of any bad news from those negotiations as good news. “Some corporate clients were joining to sell their dollars,” said a trader at a foreign bank in Shanghai. Bond markets have been turning too. U.S. Treasury debt prices erased early gains after a soft 30-year bond auction and in reaction to Powell’s comments on the Fed “substantially” reducing the size of its balance sheet. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield last stood at 2.728 percent. Crude prices held near four-week highs, lifted by optimism on U.S.-China talks and as OPEC-led crude output cuts started to tighten supply. In early European trade West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 0.9 percent at $53.07 per barrel, the highest level in almost a month. Brent crude futures traded at $62.18 per barrel, up 0.8 percent on the day.

2019-01-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) has completed its 3.9 billion euro (£3.5 billion) project financing, paving the way for construction to be completed for start-up in 2020, its managing director said on Friday. TAP, the final leg of a $40 billion (£31.3 billion) project called the Southern Gas Corridor to transport gas from Central Asia to Western Europe, is a cornerstone of the European Union’s energy security policy to wean the bloc off Russian gas supplies. With the first delivery of gas to Europe expected in 2020, TAP will be the first non-Russian gas pipeline to supply Europe since the Medgaz link, which started deliveries from Algeria to Spain in 2011. TAP will transport up to 10 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas per year from the Shah Deniz II field in Azerbaijan to Italy. “With the financial close now achieved, TAP has reached another major milestone,” said Luca Schieppati, the TAP managing director. “With project financing now concluded, TAP can progress to the final completion of the project and delivery of Shah Deniz II gas in 2020.”  The company said it completed the financial close in December, in what was the largest project finance agreed for a European infrastructure project last year. Last year, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) approved loans for the project. The rest of the financing has come from export credit agencies and a group of 17 commercial banks, which include Bank of China, BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and UniCredit. TAP AG has the option of raising additional finance, for example for increasing the pipeline’s 10 bcm capacity to 20 bcm if demand requires it, said Stephanie Hudson, head of project finance. Schieppati said construction is running according to schedule. “More than 82 percent of construction is done. What we are doing in the construction phase is complying with the high-level environmental and social standards set by the EIB and EBRD,” he added. The project has faced opposition on environmental and political grounds, as well as from local communities in Italy amid fears it will discourage tourism in the south of the country. In October, however, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte gave Italy’s final approval to the project, which had been strongly contested by the 5-Star Movement, one of the two parties in the ruling coalition. TAP AG shareholders are BP (BP.L), SOCAR, Snam (SRG.MI), Fluxys (FLUX.BR), Enagás (ENAG.MC) and Axpo.

2019-01-11,"SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Crisis talks between India’s cash-strapped Jet Airways Ltd (JET.NS) and aircraft lessors have failed to ease a row over late payments, prompting some lessors to explore taking back aircraft, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. In what one of the people described as an ill-tempered showdown between the airline and some of the world’s leading leasing firms, Jet’s main lender State Bank of India (SBI.NS) sought to provide reassurance that India’s biggest full-service carrier is doing all it can to pay its staff, suppliers and creditors. “Jet has been delinquent for many months. Nobody wants to get in a situation where the problems worsen and it becomes even more difficult to take out aircraft,” one of the people said. Jet controls over a sixth of a market experiencing an unprecedented boom in air travel. Yet high fuel taxes, a weak rupee and price competition have squeezed profitability, leaving Jet with 80.52 billion rupees ($1.14 billion) in net debt as at the end of September and defaulting on payments. The airline had previously told some lessors it would clear arrears by Dec. 31, but was unable do so, the people close to the matter said. (For an interactive graphic on India's aviation market, click tmsnrt.rs/2xlWaet) At meetings on Tuesday, held at SBI’s headquarters in Mumbai’s business district, the bank’s Chairman Rajnish Kumar was asked how Jet planned to raise equity or debt, said one of the people - an attendee, who found the responses lacked sufficient detail. Other attendees included Jet’s management team, including the airline’s founder and Chairman Naresh Goyal, as well as a senior adviser of Etihad Airways, which owns 24 percent of Jet and which did not provide any assurances, the person said. An official from Punjab National Bank (PNBK.NS) later said lenders have “in-principle” agreed to extend some help to Jet, but details on the mechanics of it are still being worked out. Some lessors have engaged with lawyers, are working with their technical teams about repossession and are monitoring the planes, but the situation could be complicated by a new bankruptcy law that allows up to 270 days where no action is permitted against the debtor or its assets, the person said. Lessors such as GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) SMBC Aviation Capital and Jackson Square are looking into stopping the transfer of Boeing Co (BA.N) 737 MAX jets that had been due for delivery to Jet, the person said. A second person said deliveries of 737 MAX jets from lessors had been behind schedule since November. Avolon, DAE Aerospace, BOC Aviation Ltd 2558.HK and Aircastle Ltd (AYR.N) also attended the meetings along with GECAS and SMBC, one of the people said, declining to specify which are considering reclaiming planes. Jet Airways, in a statement on Friday, said the airline is working on its turnaround strategy and updating its partners, in real time, on efforts taken to improve its liquidity. “A comprehensive plan that will ensure business sustainability, preserve value, and enable the company to honor its obligations was outlined,” a Jet spokesman said in the statement, adding that the meeting took place in an atmosphere of cordiality and mutual appreciation. The turnaround plan involves creating a competitive cost structure and restructuring the balance sheet, among other things, and is expected to “deliver a positive impact on the financials of the company,” he said.  SBI and SMBC Aviation did not immediately respond to requests for comment. DAE Aerospace, GECAS, Aircastle and Jackson Square did not respond outside of regular business hours. Etihad, BOC Aviation and Avolon declined to comment. The people familiar with the talks were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter and so declined to be identified. Jet, controlled by Goyal, has turned to Etihad for financial help. However, the Abu Dhabi airline is not “in any position to sink new equity into Jet at this juncture,” said a person familiar with Etihad’s position. Etihad posted a “significant loss” at the end of last year that would continue into 2019, according to an internal memo seen by sources on Thursday. The memo also showed 50 pilots would lose their jobs as the airline cut costs. Jet held talks with Indian conglomerate Tata Sons Ltd [TATAS.UL] about financial aid last year. Sources told Reuters that Goyal ended the talks because Tata would have wanted him to step down or take a less prominent role. A source close to Tata on Thursday said there had been no recent engagement with Jet and doing so was “extremely unlikely” because Tata people had “moved on internally”. Tata Sons declined to comment on Friday. After the disorderly collapse of Kingfisher Airlines in 2012, India modified rules in line with the Cape Town convention, an international treaty making it easier for foreign owners to repossess aircraft when airlines default on payments. Lessors can file a complaint with the government which has the power to cancel the registration of a plane within five working days and allow lessors to repossess it subject to certain conditions, including unpaid dues on the aircraft. Some laws conflict with full implementation of the convention and the government in October said it was consulting to revise those laws - a move that could reduce lease rates for Indian carriers. Nevertheless, the ability to repossess a plane can be a more complicated process in India than in some other countries. On Tuesday, Jet proposed to creditors that it would catch up with debt payments in arrears as of September, and from April meet debt payments as they come due, showed a document seen by Reuters. Jet’s debt payments will be large over the next few years, starting with about 17 billion rupees due by March-end, credit-ratings firm ICRA said in a Jan. 2 research note.

2019-01-11,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China could raise average life expectancy by 2.9 years if it improves air quality to levels recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO), according a new study from a U.S. research group. China has vowed to determine the precise impact of air and water pollution on health as part of its efforts to raise average life expectancy to 79 years by 2030 from 76.3 years in 2015.        According to the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), big air quality improvements made in the last five years have already been enough to push up average lifespans. “China is winning its war against pollution ... (The country) is due to see dramatic improvements in the overall health of its people, including longer lifespans, if these improvements are sustained,” EPIC director Michael Greenstone said at an event in Beijing on Thursday. According to the EPIC’s findings, air quality improvements made in the smog-prone northern city of Tianjin over the last five years are already expected to have raised the average lifespan of its 13 million residents by 1.2 years.         China cut average concentrations of hazardous particles known as PM2.5 to an average of 39 micrograms per cubic metre last year, down 9.3 percent from 2017 after a campaign to curb coal use and improve industry and vehicle standards. However, average emission levels remain significantly higher than China’s own 35-microgram standard, as well as the 10-microgram limit recommended by the WHO. In northern industrial regions, average concentrations are much higher. In a study cited by state-owned news agency Xinhua on Friday, a group of top Chinese health experts identified air and water pollution as one of the major health risks in China for the next 20 years, alongside obesity, depression and Alzheimer’s disease. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang declared “war” on pollution in 2014 amid fears that the damage done to the country’s environment as a result of more than 30 years of untrammelled economic growth would lead to social unrest. However, with much of the low-hanging fruit already taken and the economy facing a slowdown, China has admitted that the campaign is under pressure. “It would be very difficult for China to meet the WHO standards even with strong efforts to reduce industrial emissions and fossil fuel consumption,” Jiang Kejun, research professor at the Energy Research Institute, a government think tank, told Reuters on the sidelines of the Thursday event. “Emissions from non-industrial sectors, agriculture for instance, also play a big part in air pollution and are hard to put under control,” he said.

2019-01-11,"KAMPALA, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Uganda aims to impose financial penalties from March on its sole power distributor Umeme Ltd for any frequent and prolonged supply outages, the regulator said. The public has long complained about high tariffs and long power cuts, while unreliable supplies add extra costs to businesses, which often run costly stand-by generators to keep operations going during outages. The Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA) said in a notice published on its website that it intended to set targets for “reliability and quality” of power supplied by Umeme, which secured a 25-year licence in 2005 to be the sole distributor. “Frequent and long power outages/interruptions impose a cost on consumers in terms of the cost of energy not supplied,” the notice said. “The licensee will incur a financial penalty for failing to achieve the targets.” It did not give details of the proposed penalties. ERA spokesman, Julius Wandera, said the regulator planned to impose the new terms in March, after a public consultation. “Under the current system, it was just us using the carrot and begging them to reduce outages. Now we are introducing the stick,” he said. Umeme is majority owned by the state-controlled pensions fund NSSF, while South African funds including Allan Gray, Kimberlite Frontier Africa Master Fund and Investec Asset Management Africa Fund also have stakes. The East African country’s grid now reaches just 23 percent of the population of 40 million. Umeme has said it plans to spend $1.2 billion over seven years to expand and upgrade the grid to cope with additional supplies from new dams being built that will double the nation’s generation capacity from about 800 megawatts now.

2019-01-11,"(Adds link to study, no change to text) * Ocean warming accelerating - Chinese, U.S. study shows * Extra heat disrupts marine life * Study at: here By Alister Doyle, Environment Correspondent OSLO, Jan 10 (Reuters) - The oceans are warming faster than previously estimated, setting a new temperature record in 2018 in a trend that is damaging marine life, scientists said on Thursday. New measurements, aided by an international network of 3,900 floats deployed in the oceans since 2000, showed more warming since 1971 than calculated by the latest U.N. assessment of climate change in 2013, they said. And “observational records of ocean heat content show that ocean warming is accelerating,” the authors in China and the United States wrote in the journal Science of ocean waters down to 2,000 metres (6,600 ft). Man-made greenhouse gas emissions are warming the atmosphere, according to the overwhelming majority of climate scientists, and a large part of the heat gets absorbed by the oceans. That in turn is forcing fish to flee to cooler waters. “Global warming is here, and has major consequences already. There is no doubt, none!” the authors wrote in a statement. Almost 200 nations plan to phase out fossil fuels this century under the 2015 Paris climate agreement to limit warming. U.S. President Donald Trump, who wants to promote U.S. fossil fuels, plans to pull out of the pact in 2020. Data due for publication next week will show “2018 was the warmest year on record for the global ocean, surpassing 2017,” said lead author Lijing Cheng, of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He told Reuters that records for ocean warming had been broken almost yearly since 2000. Overall, temperatures in the ocean down to 2,000 metres rose about 0.1 degree Celsius (0.18F) from 1971-2010, he said. The 2013 U.N. assessment estimated slower rates of heat uptake but did not give a single comparable number. A separate study on Monday, by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, said 2018 was the fourth warmest year for global surface temperatures in records dating back to the 19th century. Ocean temperatures are less influenced by year-to-year variations in the weather. It can take more than 1,000 years for deep ocean temperatures to adjust to changes at the surface. “The deep ocean reflects the climate of the deep and uncertain past,” Kevin Trenberth, of the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research and a co-author of Thursday’s study, told Reuters. Among effects, extra warmth can reduce oxygen in the oceans and damages coral reefs that are nurseries for fish, the scientists said. Warmer seas release more moisture that can stoke more powerful storms. Warmer ocean water also raises sea levels by melting ice, including around the edges of Antarctica and Greenland.

2019-01-11,"* Phoenix eyes commercial operations starting in 2023 * Phoenix partnering with CNOOC gas, power unit on project * LNG terminal to have 2.2 mln T/yr capacity (Adds project cost estimate in headline and paragraphs 1 and 7) MANILA, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Philippines firm Phoenix Petroleum said on Friday it has won government approval to build the nation’s first liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal for $2 billion, in partnership with China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC). Phoenix, a fuel retailer, said it plans to break ground this year for the LNG regasification and receiving terminal south of the capital Manila, in a country that still relies heavily on coal as a fuel source. The company said its Tanglawan Philippine LNG Inc unit, which will undertake the project, is partnering with CNOOC Gas and Power Group Co Ltd, a unit of CNOOC and China’s largest LNG importer and terminal operator. The LNG facility is expected to have a capacity of 2.2 million tonnes per year, with commercial operations targeted to start by 2023, Phoenix said in a regulatory filing. The Philippines has been looking to start importing LNG to feed gas-fired power plants in Batangas, south of the capital, as domestic gas supplies from its Malampaya field are set to run out in 2024 at the earliest. Phoenix, owned by local businessman Dennis Uy who helped bankroll Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s 2016 election campaign, also plans to build a 2,000-megawatt gas-fired power plant as part of the integrated project in Batangas province. Raymond Zorilla, Phoenix vice-president for external affairs, said investments will reach $686 million for the regasification terminal and $1.3 billion for the power plant. Dozens of domestic and foreign companies had expressed interest in the LNG project, but only three groups, including the Phoenix-CNOOC group, were short-listed. The other two were state-owned Philippine National Oil Company and power producer First Gen Corp with Tokyo Gas. Whether the two other groups would be allowed to build their own facilities would depend on the viability of their project proposals, DOE Assistant Secretary Leonido Pulido told Reuters. First Gen operates four power plants in Batangas with a combined capacity of about 2,000 MW, all running on Malampaya natural gas. The Malampaya gas field, which lies near the disputed South China Sea waters and is operated by a unit of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, fuels plants that supply about 40 percent of the power for the main Luzon island.

2019-01-11,"* Temperature at average to above average this week - data * Spot demand from China expected to be slow until Lunar New Year * Indian companies seek cargoes for Jan-Feb By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) slid to an eight-month low this week amid milder winter weather, which has curbed prompt demand growth in the region. Spot prices for February delivery to Asia LNG-AS this week dropped to $8.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), lowest since mid-May, industry sources said. Prices for cargoes to be delivered in March were estimated at about $8.30 per mmBtu, they added. Refinitiv Eikon weather data show average to above-average temperatures in Tokyo, Beijing and Shanghai. Inventory levels in China, the world’s second-largest importer of LNG, are quite high, traders familiar with the Chinese market said. “Chinese have bought quite a lot ahead of winter as they were expecting demand to spike, but due to mild winter, inventory is still sufficient,” one of them said. LNG spot buying is expected to be limited at least until Lunar New Year due to high stocks, a second trader said. Natural gas supplies to China from Turkmenistan’s state-owned energy major Konzern were expected to return to planned levels this week, after supply disruptions in November, the Chinese state planner said earlier in the week. Gas imports from China’s largest supplier of piped natural gas dropped several times in November, but the volumes and durations were small, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said on its website. There has been minimal impact on the country’s LNG requirements due to the gas disruption, trade sources said. However, Japan’s third-biggest utility Chubu Electric Power Co said it needed power supplies from seven other utilities to meet rising demand caused by cold weather and insufficient output from solar generation systems. Indian demand for LNG has also been firm with Torrent Power, Gail (India), Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) and Indian Oil Corp seeking cargoes through tenders. On the supply side, Australia’s BHP Group and Angola LNG offered cargoes for January to February. Mexico’s state power utility CFE bought four of five cargoes that it had sought for delivery in Manzanillo from Feb. 1 to April 30, traders said. A tender issued by Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co (KUFPEC) offering a mid-February cargo from the Wheatstone plant in Australia was likely awarded to commodity trader Gunvor at low to mid-$7 per mmBtu, traders said.

As the Fed’s dovish stance kept a lid on the dollar, China’s yuan rose to its highest levels in more than five months and was on course for its biggest weekly gains since the 2005 revaluation in onshore trade. European shares are expected to rise, and financial spread-betters expect Britain’s FTSE, France’s CAC , Germany’s DAX to tick up 0.1 - 0.2 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.29 percent to the highest levels since Dec. 6, while Japan’s benchmark Nikkei advanced 0.97 percent. Shanghai Composite Index initially rose 0.56 percent. Wall Street extended its rally into a fifth straight day on Thursday in a whipsaw trading session as investors responded to mixed comments by Powell, while a warning from Macy’s pummelled retail stocks. At the Economic Club of Washington, Powell reiterated the views of other policymakers that the Fed would be patient about interest rate hikes. Major U.S. stock indexes also quickly recovered from brief losses after Powell said that the Fed’s balance sheet would be “substantially smaller”. “The word ‘patient’ is used often when the Fed’s policy direction is still tightening but its next rate hike can wait for a considerable time. So risk assets now enjoy support from what we can call Powell put,” said Tomoaki Shishido, economist at Nomura Securities. The term “Powell put” refers to the idea that Powell’s policy will protect investors from falls in share prices, much like put options, or rights to sell assets at a pre-determined price. Investors who worry about a fall in equity prices often buy their put options for hedge. “Similarly, Trump also softened his stance on China after sharp falls in stock prices. He has offered an olive branch to China and there’s no reason China would not want to accept it,” he said. U.S. and Chinese officials are working on arrangements for higher-level trade talks after mid-level officials this week discussed U.S. demands that would require structural change in China to address issues such as IP theft, forced technology transfers and other non-tariff barriers. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will “most likely” visit Washington later in January for trade talks. “For markets the upshot is that the outlook for 2019 is looking better as tensions de-escalate, creating the potential for a re-rating of risk assets as the tail risk of a near-term trade war is partially priced out,” said Jeremy Lawson, chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Edinburgh. “This is especially the case in Asia,” he added. Still, fundamental tensions between the U.S. and China “are unlikely to go away and there is a high likelihood that any agreement to suspend tariffs eventually breaks down when it becomes clear that Trump’s objectives cannot really be met.” Some investors are also increasingly wary of lingering disputes in Washington over a wall Trump wants on the U.S.-Mexico border, which has led to a weeks-long partial government shutdown. Flanked by border agents who are going without paychecks during the shutdown, Trump again threatened on Thursday to declare a national emergency to bypass Congress to fund a wall. In the foreign exchange markets, the dollar was broadly soft after a small rebound from three-month lows the previous day. The dollar index, measuring it against major peers, dipped 0.1 percent to 95.38. The euro firmed 0.2 percent to $1.1523, while the dollar dipped 0.1 percent to 108.28 yen. The yuan, both onshore and offshore, climbed to the highest levels since late July, aided by a weaker dollar and rising hopes of progress in the U.S.-China talks. In onshore trade, the Chinese currency has risen 1.8 percent this week, the biggest gain since July 2005 when Beijing abandoned the yuan’s peg to the dollar. U.S. Treasury debt prices erased early gains after a soft 30-year bond auction and in reaction to Powell’s comments on the Fed “substantially” reducing the size of its balance sheet. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield last stood at 2.728 percent. Crude prices held near four-week highs, lifted by optimism on U.S.-China talks and as OPEC-led crude output cuts started to tighten supply. In late Asian trade, West Texas Intermediate crude futures were little changed at $52.58 per barrel, not far from Thursday’s peak of $52.78, its highest since Dec. 14. Brent crude futures traded at $61.58 per barrel, near this week’s peak of $61.91.

With storage limited in Mexico, the decision by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to shut pipelines and move fuel mostly by rail and truck has slowed transport, causing long lines for consumers and slowed deliveries at ports, where more than 7 million barrels of fuel - enough for several days of use in Mexico - languish.  The crackdown on fuel theft, a crime that has drained billions of dollars from state coffers and is blamed for rising violence in some regions, is the leftist president’s first major move against criminals and corruption since taking office in December, but risks angering consumers and hurting the economy. Lines of drivers snaked from gas stations in Mexico City on Wednesday as the government crackdown on fuel theft led to panic purchases, despite assurances from Lopez Obrador that his efforts were succeeding. Rocio Nahle, Mexico’s Energy Minister, said in an interview on Thursday that the she had no information on port bottlenecks, but added that terminals are almost full and inventory drainage from them is running slow as a portion of distribution is being made by truck. “There is product. We are buying. Terminals are almost full, we have much product and are moving it. (Transportation by truck) is slower than by pipeline,” she said. State-run Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) started building an inventory on Dec. 20 in preparation for pipeline closures, Nahle said on Wednesday. She denied there was fuel scarcity in Mexico, which is among the world’s top four importers of gasoline. But fuel distribution to stations has slowed in recent days because of the switch to less efficient truck transportation. Backlogs of tankers bringing imported fuel have started forming around Pemex’s maritime terminals, which are not draining inventories at their typical rhythm, also creating delays for tanker unloading, the traders said. As of Jan. 9, Mexico’s main port of entry for fuel imports, Pajaritos in the Gulf, had 15 tankers waiting to discharge, some of them since December. The neighbouring Tuxpan terminal had 9 tankers waiting to discharge gasoline and other fuel, including liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), according to the Eikon data.  The 24 vessels are jointly carrying about 7.2 million barrels of fuel, enough for nearly five days of consumption. As limitations to import fuel by vessel have grown, Pemex’s trading arm PMI has tapped suppliers to secure fuel by rail from the United States, one of the traders added. “PMI is securing as much by rail as possible, both for gasoline and ultra low sulphur diesel (ULSD). This is limited by the rail loading and unloading capabilities still in both the U.S. and Mexico,” the trader said. The company has had no problems finding suppliers in the United States, another trader said, adding that fuel shortages in some areas of Mexico are not the result of fewer imports, but caused by domestic distribution hiccups. Pemex is producing some 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) of gasoline, Lopez Obrador said, slightly above November’s average of 171,700 bpd. “There’s enough fuel in the country,” Lopez Obrador said on Monday. He said that retail domestic prices have not increased mostly because of lower international prices.  But Pemex’s fuel production from January to November 2018 was 33 percent less than for all of 2017, and it has recently struggled to maintain refineries in service.  To compensate for declining domestic fuel output, Pemex has ramped up imports. For last year through November, it purchased 975,200 bpd, about two-thirds of Mexico’s consumption, compared with the 799,500 bpd it imported in 2016, which represented 49 percent of consumption. Some independent retailers that started operating in Mexico after reforms opening the energy sector are separately importing themselves. All the purchases are making Mexico increasingly dependent on imported fuel, mostly from the United States. But the country still only has enough storage capacity for three days of consumption, causing bottlenecks to show up quickly. “More vessels booked from U.S. West Coast refineries in December, are on the way, causing more of a logjam. If the plan was to use trucks instead of pipelines to move product, it has failed,” one broker said.

A Reuters survey had forecast November’s annual output growth to ease to 2.2 percent, down from a 4.2 percent rise in October. The index measures factory output from the manufacturing, electricity generation and mining sectors. Growth in November was supported by a 3.6 percent increase in the manufacturing index and 3.2 percent rise in the electricity index, data from the Statistics Department showed. The mining index, however, dipped 0.7 percent, the data showed. Malaysia’s exports in November had grown marginally by 1.6 percent from a year earlier, on a sharp drop in demand from China and a contraction in exports to the U.S. of manufactured goods.

2019-01-11,"* Powell says Fed can be patient as U.S. economy evolves in 2019 * U.S. expects China’s top trade negotiator to visitlikely in Jan * Yuan hits 5-mth high, to make biggest weekly gain since 2005 * Trump threatens to use emergency power to fund Mexico wall By Tomo Uetake and Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Asian stocks inched up to five-week highs on Friday, after Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated the Federal Reserve will be patient about raising interest rates and news that trade talks between Washington and Beijing are moving to higher levels. As the Fed’s dovish stance kept a lid on the dollar, China’s yuan rose to its highest levels in more than five months and was on course for its biggest weekly gains since the 2005 revaluation in onshore trade. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.2 percent to the highest levels since Dec. 6, while Japan’s benchmark Nikkei advanced 0.7 percent. Shanghai Composite Index initially rose 0.8 percent, but that was pared to just 0.1 percent. Wall Street extended its rally into a fifth straight day on Thursday in a whipsaw trading session as investors responded to mixed comments by Powell, while a warning from Macy’s pummelled retail stocks. At the Economic Club of Washington, Powell reiterated the views of other policymakers that the Fed would be patient about interest rate hikes. Major U.S. stock indexes also quickly recovered from brief losses after Powell said that the Fed’s balance sheet would be “substantially smaller”. “The word ‘patient’ is used often when the Fed’s policy direction is still tightening but its next rate hike can wait for a considerable time. So risk assets now enjoy support from what we can call Powell put,” said Tomoaki Shishido, economist at Nomura Securities. “Similarly, Trump also softened his stance on China after sharp falls in stock prices. He has offered an olive branch to China and there’s no reason China would not want to accept it,” he said. U.S. and Chinese officials are working on arrangements for higher-level trade talks after mid-level officials this week discussed U.S. demands that would require structural change in China to address issues such as IP theft, forced technology transfers and other non-tariff barriers. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said late on Thursday that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will “most likely” visit Washington later in January for trade talks. “For markets the upshot is that the outlook for 2019 is looking better as tensions de-escalate, creating the potential for a re-rating of risk assets as the tail risk of a near-term trade war is partially priced out,” said Jeremy Lawson, chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Edinburgh. “This is especially the case in Asia,” he added. Still, fundamental tensions between the U.S. and China “are unlikely to go away and there is a high likelihood that any agreement to suspend tariffs eventually breaks down when it becomes clear that Trump’s objectives cannot really be met.” Some investors are also increasingly wary of lingering disputes in Washington over a wall Trump wants on the U.S.-Mexico border, which has led to a weeks-long partial government shutdown. Flanked by border agents who are going without paychecks during the shutdown, Trump again threatened on Thursday to declare a national emergency to bypass Congress to fund a wall. In the foreign exchange markets, the dollar was broadly soft after a small rebound from three-month lows the previous day. The dollar index, measuring it against major peers, dipped 0.1 percent to 95.38. The euro firmed 0.2 percent to $1.1523, while the dollar dipped 0.1 percent to 108.28 yen. The yuan, both onshore and offshore, climbed to the highest levels since late July, aided by a weaker dollar and rising hopes of progress in the U.S.-China talks. In onshore trade, the Chinese currency has risen 1.6 percent this week, the biggest gain since July 2005 when Beijing abandoned the yuan’s peg to the dollar. U.S. Treasury debt prices erased early gains after a soft 30-year bond auction and in reaction to Powell’s comments on the Fed “substantially” reducing the size of its balance sheet. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield last stood at 2.728 percent. Crude prices held near one-month highs, but a more than week-long in oil rally slowed as optimism surrounding U.S.-China trade talks faded a little. In Asian trade, West Texas Intermediate crude futures slipped 0.6 percent to $52.30 per barrel.

2019-01-11,"SHANGHAI, Jan 11 (Reuters) - China’s fourth Westinghouse-designed AP1000 reactor went into full operation after a trial run this week, the operator said, marking the completion of the first phase of the project after years of delays. China signed a deal with the U.S. firm in 2007 to build four reactors, hoping to create a platform for Beijing’s ambitious nuclear power expansion plans, but the roll-out of the unproven “third-generation” technology has been beset by safety concerns and design problems. The second unit of the Haiyang nuclear power project on the eastern coast of China’s Shandong province is now ready to go into full commercial operation after 168 hours of full-load operations, China’s State Power Investment Corp said in statement on Thursday. China put the world’s first AP1000 into operation at Sanmen in Zhejiang province last September, four years later than originally scheduled. Two more went into operation at Sanmen and Haiyang later in the year. The AP1000 is designed by U.S.-based Westinghouse, which was acquired by Brookfield Business Partners from Japan’s Toshiba last August following bankruptcy restructuring. The completion of the project brings China’s total nuclear capacity up to 45 gigawatts, with 46 reactor units in operation throughout the country. Nuclear makes up about 2.5 percent of the country’s generation capacity. China has scaled back the pace of new reactor approvals and no new conventional project has been given the go-ahead in more than three years. It is now expected to fall short of its 2020 target to have 58 gigawatts of working capacity and another 30 gigawatts under construction. At the government’s annual energy meeting in December, officials made no commitments to approving and building any new projects in 2019, saying only that projects now under construction would be “pushed forward in an orderly manner”.

2019-01-11,"(Adds Exxon declining to comment) By Neil Marks GEORGETOWN, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Seismic research vessels hired by Exxon Mobil to explore for oil off Guyana’s coast have not returned to the site of a December incident with Venezuela’s navy, but they may in the future, Guyana’s foreign minister said on Thursday. Guyana, with no history of oil production, has become the focus of intense interest since Exxon announced the discovery of over 5 billion barrels of oil and gas off its shores. That has reignited a century-old territorial dispute with neighboring Venezuela. OPEC-member Venezuela’s crude output is near its lowest levels in 70 years amid an economic crisis. In a speech at a trade union forum in the capital Georgetown, Foreign Minister Carl Greenidge said the Dec. 22 incident when the ships complied with Venezuela’s order to turn around - which both countries say took place within their territorial waters - would not necessarily hold back future exploration. “They haven’t returned to the area. It doesn’t mean they can’t return in the future,” Greenidge said. “We’re not speaking in absolutes here.” Other oil companies, including Spain’s Repsol SA, are active in offshore Guyana. Greenidge said Chevron Corp had applied for a government license, without providing further detail. Chevron does not comment on specific business opportunities, a spokeswoman said. According to a notice posted on Guyana’s Maritime Administration Department’s website before the incident, the ships’ activities were expected to begin on Dec. 6, 2018, and conclude on Dec. 31. No new notice has been posted. Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Greenidge’s statements. In a press conference on Wednesday, socialist President Nicolas Maduro praised the armed forces for intercepting the ships, noting that if it were not for their patrol, “one day we would get there and they would be taking oil.” “Is a world like that viable, without respect for international law?” Maduro said. Exxon declined to comment.

But the rally’s momentum slowed partly as investors sought more clarity on whether the United States and China could make headway on their talks on trade as well as intellectual property (IP) rights.

2019-01-11,"SINGAPORE, Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices edged down on Friday as concerns over economic growth were rekindled after talks fell short of offering concrete steps to end the Sino-U.S. trade conflict, although OPEC-led production cuts bolstered sentiment in crude markets. Oil prices were also supported by comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday that the central bank had the ability to be patient on monetary policy. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures had slipped 23 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last settlement to $52.36 per barrel by 0016 GMT. However, U.S. crude was on track for a second consecutive week of gains and its largest weekly percentage increase in more than two years. WTI has climbed about 9 percent so far this week, its biggest weekly rise since December, 2016. International Brent crude futures had yet to trade. China said three days of talks with the United States that wrapped up on Wednesday had established a “foundation” to resolve differences over trade. But it gave few details on key issues at stake, including a scheduled U.S. tariff increase on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. A partial U.S. government shutdown and tepid economic data in some countries also dragged on broad financial markets. “The U.S. government shutdown and weak retail sales figures around the world reinvigorated concerns about (economic) growth,” analysts at ANZ bank said in a note on Friday. China’s producer prices in December rose at their slowest pace in more than two years, a worrying sign of deflationary risks that could see Beijing roll out more policy support to help stabilise the economy. “However, investors are becoming increasingly confident that OPEC+ production cuts will balance the market,” ANZ said. Saudi Arabia said earlier this week that supply curbs started in late 2018 by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producers including Russia, would bring the oil market into balance. “Saudi is turning the screws on export supply in order to re-balance the market in their favour. Prices are maintaining highs which suggests that the recent bullish move is not yet over,” said Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Probis Securities in Sydney. “We expect more bullish rhetoric from OPEC, especially from Saudi Arabia to help shore up the prices. U.S. producers will just enjoy the rise.” The likelihood of supply curbs elsewhere also helped buoy oil markets. Norway’s oil industry regulator said the country’s crude output in 2019 would be smaller than previously forecast and at its lowest level in three decades.

2019-01-11,"LONDON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Iran will see its crude exports severely curtailed for a third month in January as it is struggling to find new buyers amid fresh U.S. sanctions even though its traditional customers secured waivers, according to tanker data and industry sources. Iran’s crude exports in November plummeted to below 1 million barrels per day, from regular sales of 2.5 million bpd before sanctions were imposed in May, and taking them back to where they stood during the previous round of sanctions in 2012-2016. Buyers said plunging exports in November, which will severely hit the Islamic Republic’s budget revenues, were caused by a total lack of clarity of what volumes they were allowed to purchase under the new U.S. sanctions. Washington later gave a fairly generous set of waivers to eight traditional Iranian oil buyers - including China, India, Japan and South Korea - to avoid a rally in oil prices, but the measure has failed to give a meaningful boost to exports. According to tanker data and industry sources, Iran’s crude shipments remained below 1 million bpd in December and are unlikely to exceed that level in January despite rising month-on-month. “In January, I expect a slight uptick in the second half of the month with some Asian lifting resuming,” one of the sources said. “For the time being, I am pencilling in around 900,000 bpd for January.” Regular buyer Taiwan said last year it was not yet buying Iranian oil despite receiving a waiver because of a lack of a clear payment mechanism. Iran has said its exports have not declined as much as estimated by the industry because it was selling oil to new buyers. But it declined to disclose them because of a fear of new sanctions. A restrained level of Iranian shipments would assist the new global push to cut oil supply in 2019 led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, from which Iran is exempt, and lend support to oil prices. “We are forecasting slightly more than December, but not massive,” said a source at another company that monitors Iranian shipments, putting the month-on-month rise at below 50,000 bpd. Iranian exports are higher if condensate, a type of light oil, is counted as well as crude. Kpler, another company that tracks oil flows, put Iranian crude and condensate exports at 1.35 million bpd in December. Tracking Iranian exports has become harder since the sanctions began as ships switch off tracking systems, industry sources say, keeping some of the shipments hidden. According to Refinitiv Eikon data, shipments including condensate plunged to about 650,000 bpd in December, although such figures are probably not counting all the tankers that switch off their AIS tracking signal. Some buyers that stayed away in November are returning. Turkey has resumed imports of Iranian oil after a one-month hiatus in November, Reuters reported on Tuesday, at a volume less than half of the pre-sanctions amount. Shipments were at least 2.5 million bpd in April, the month before U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and reimposed sanctions. Tehran has vowed to keep exporting oil despite the U.S. effort to reduce its shipments to zero. Graphic by Amanda Cooper
