2018-10-08,"(Updates with additional quotes) By Jarrett Renshaw Oct 8 (Reuters) - Irving Oil Corp shut its Saint John refinery in the Canadian province of New Brunswick on Monday morning after an explosion and a major fire that followed, with photos showing flames and smoke billowing from the complex. The company said on Twitter it was dealing with a “major incident” at the 320,000 barrel-per-day refinery, but that all of its employees and contractors have been accounted for, none of them seriously injured. Saint John Regional Hospital treated and released five people with minor injuries as a result of the explosion, according to Horizon Health, operator of the hospital. “I heard a loud bang that shook our house and rattled the windows,” said Gordon Dalzell, who lives in Saint John near the refinery. He said he and others saw a “very large black sooty plume of smoke” from their street. Energy intelligence service Genscape reported the fire appeared to have occurred near the catalytic reformer. The crude section, catalytic reformer and a cogeneration unit were shut following the incident, Genscape reported, adding that multiple units were already offline for maintenance. The company shut most of the plant for planned maintenance in late September, but the smaller, 25,000 bpd gasoline-making units and the 125,000 bpd crude unit were still running, a source familiar with the plant’s operations said. The source said he believed the explosion was within the section of the plant that houses the hydrogen unit. More than one-half of the finished products from the refinery are exported to the U.S. Northeast, according to Irving’s website. Reports of the fire sparked a rally in futures in refined products; gasoline was up about 2 percent following the reports but subsequently was only 0.4 percent higher.

2018-10-08,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil prices almost fully recovered from a sharp drop on Monday, paring losses as investors bet China’s economic stimulus moves would lift crude demand in the world’s No. 2 economy.  Traders sent global benchmark Brent crude tumbling below $83 per barrel early in the session after China’s central bank on Sunday slashed lenders’ reserve requirements, a signal Beijing is working to maintain economic growth. “The reaction by the Chinese to the slowdown there is a salve the market started to price back in,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York.  Brent crude LCOc1 hit a session low of $82.66 but settled just 25 cents lower at $83.91 per barrel. Brent hit a four-year high of $86.74 last week.  U.S. crude CLc1 had fallen to a session low of $73.07 per barrel but climbed back up to settle at $74.29, just 5 cents lower.   Traders said oil prices also got a boost from a new report showing a small drop in oil inventories last week at the main U.S. storage hub at Cushing, Oklahoma.  Cushing storage levels were about 28.5 million barrels on Friday, market intelligence firm Genscape reported, according to traders who saw the report. They said that was down 15,000 barrels from what Genscape reported earlier in the week. The report of a small crude decline eased fears that had pressured oil prices after U.S. government data on Wednesday showed a large build in the U.S. commercial crude stockpile.  Also pressuring oil below $83 a barrel in early trade were reports that some Iranian oil exports will keep flowing after the U.S. re-imposes sanctions. Last week, Saudi Arabia announced plans to lift crude output next month to 10.7 million barrels per day (bpd), the kingdom’s highest level ever.  Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh on Monday called a Saudi claim that the kingdom could replace Iran’s crude exports “nonsense.”  “Iran’s oil cannot be replaced by Saudi Arabia nor any other country,” Zanganeh said, according to his ministry’s website. On Monday, Gulf of Mexico oil companies shut down 19 percent of oil production as Hurricane Michael moved toward eastern Gulf states including Florida. If current forecasts prove accurate, the hurricane would largely miss major producing assets in the Gulf, analysts said.  However, “if the storm wobbles at all, it’ll be a direct hit on Gulf of Mexico producing assets,” Kilduff said.

European markets slid, with defensive stocks under pressure as investor confidence took a knock from last week’s spike in Treasury yields and amid heightened expectations for further interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed down 1.14 percent, it’s biggest one-day drop in a month, while MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.32 percent. The United States remains concerned about China’s recent currency depreciation, a senior Treasury official said, adding that it was unclear whether Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would meet with any Chinese officials this week. Washington last month slapped tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, which prompted Beijing to retaliate with duties on $60 billion worth of U.S. products. Beijing moved over the weekend to spur more lending. Spot yuan slid to its lowest official close in seven weeks against the dollar on expectations of more easing by China. Wall Street was mixed on a day the U.S. bond market was closed because of the Columbus Day holiday. Fear of slowing growth led to a drop in high-flying stocks that have led the U.S. equity rally. The biggest decliners were technology stocks, which tumbled 1.45 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 31.97 points, or 0.12 percent, to 26,479.02. The S&P 500 gained 0.41 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,885.98 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 42.66 points, or 0.55 percent, to 7,745.79. Chinese stocks fell in their biggest one-day drop since February after markets re-opened following a week-long holiday in China, with the Shanghai-Shenzhen CSI 300 index down more than 4 percent for only the second time in more than 2-1/2 years. For the year, Chinese indexes are down about 18 percent. Yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note were at seven-year highs, after a solid jobs report last week raised the likelihood of faster interest rate hikes. “There’s a hangover from last week’s rapid move in yields and just because the bond market’s closed, doesn’t mean investors are not worried,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. The yield on Italian government 10-year bonds rose nearly 20 basis points to 3.60 percent, the highest since February 2014, while Italy’s FTSE MIB index fell 2.4 percent to its lowest in more than 17 months. Italy’s stock market index fell 2.4 percent to its weakest since April 2017. Brazil’s real currency hit a two-month high and stocks jumped after market-preferred presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro’s strong first-round win on Sunday boosted investor confidence. The real shot up 2.5 percent and the Bovespa index jumped 4.4 percent. Gold fell more than 1 percent as investors sought refuge in the dollar, which has been lifted by recent strong U.S. economic data that have reinforced rate hike expectations. Gold is down more than 12 percent from an April peak largely due to a strong dollar, which reflects a vibrant U.S. economy, rising U.S. rates and fears of a global trade war. U.S. gold futures settled down 1.41 percent at $1,188.60 an ounce. “We are seeing some strength in the dollar index and some weakness in the equity market and it doesn’t appear that investors are going for safety in the gold markets at all,” said Phil Streible, senior commodities strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago. The dollar index rose 0.13 percent, with the euro down 0.3 percent to $1.1488. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.65 percent versus the greenback at 112.98. Oil dropped, pressured by expectations that some Iranian oil exports will keep flowing after the U.S. re-imposes sanctions, easing a strain on supplies. U.S. crude settled down 5 cents at $74.29 a barrel and Brent fell 25 cents to settle at $83.91. Reporting by Herbert Lash,

2018-10-08,"(Adds price action and analyst quote) By Rania El Gamal and Ron Bousso ABU DHABI/LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Baker Hughes, the world’s second-largest oil services company, will take a 5 percent stake in Abu Dhabi National Oil Company’s (ADNOC) drilling unit for $550 million under a tie-up announced on Monday. Baker Hughes (BHGE) becomes the first foreign company to take a stake in one of state-owned ADNOC’s services companies under the agreement which values ADNOC Drilling at about $11 billion. It will allow Baker Hughes to cement its presence in the Middle East, the fastest growing region for oil and gas operations, and enable ADNOC Drilling to gain access to the know-how and technical expertise of a global player. Since its acquisition by General Electric Co last year, Baker Hughes has sought new business models following a sharp decline in global drilling activity since 2014. That includes offering a suite of services to oil and gas producers from exploration to drilling. “To us this is not just another partnership... this will allow ADNOC Drilling to be not only a local player but a global specialist in the drilling and oil service business,” ADNOC’s Chief Executive Sultan al-Jaber told Reuters in an interview in Abu Dhabi. It would help make ADNOC Drilling “the most efficient and the most competitive,” al-Jaber said. Baker Hughes’ CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said BHGE will have a representative on the board of ADNOC Drilling and will create a dedicated training team. The partnership will offer drilling services in the UAE and possibly abroad as well, al-Jaber said. The transaction is expected to close before the end of this year, with operations starting in 2019, ADNOC and BHGE said in a joint statement. Al-Jaber said “there are no plans at this point of time” to float a stake in ADNOC Drilling. While analysts said the deal would bode well for Baker Hughes’ long-term prospects in the United Arab Emirates, some lamented that the firm was paying too high a price in its acquisition. “We’re just not fans of OFS (oilfield service) companies having to ante up” to tap into revenue growth, analysts for investment firm Tudor Pickering Holt & Co wrote in a note on Monday. Shares of Baker Hughes were down roughly 1 percent at midday on Monday, trading around $31.65. Moelis is acting as the financial adviser to ADNOC on the transaction, while Citi is the adviser to BHGE, the two companies said in the statement.

2018-10-08,"MAPUTO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The Mozambican government said on Monday it had signed oil exploration agreements with U.S. energy firm Exxon Mobil and Russia’s Rosneft. Mozambique’s National Petroleum Institute, an energy regulator in the southern African country, said the government was preparing to sign similar agreements with South Africa’s Sasol and Italy’s Eni. The agreements could lead to as much as $700 million of investment in Mozambique as the energy firms are expected to drill a minimum of 10 wells, eight in deep water and two onshore, the institute added. The firms earlier won oil tenders as part of Mozambique’s fifth licensing round in 2014. Heavily-indebted Mozambique is hoping its oil and natural gas resources will help it recover from a debt scandal that saw it cut off from multilateral and foreign donors. More than $30 billion is expected to be invested in Mozambique’s gas sector to build capacity to produce 20 million tonnes per year of liquefied natural gas.

2018-10-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Italy’s Eni has agreed to buy half of BP’s 85 percent stake in a Libyan oil and gas license with the aim of resuming exploration next year, the companies said on Monday. Eni will acquire the 42.5 percent stake and become the operator of the exploration and production sharing agreement (EPSA) in Libya, in which the Libyan Investment Authority holds the remaining 15 percent, the companies said in a statement. The companies, along with state-owned National Oil Corp (NOC), signed a letter of intent in London on Monday paving the way for the final deal. They did not disclose financial terms of the transaction.  NOC chairman Mustafa Sanalla said the agreement showed renewed confidence in the war-torn country’s oil and gas sector. “This agreement is a clear signal and recognition by the market of the opportunities Libya has to offer and will only serve to strengthen our production outlook,” he said.  BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley hailed the deal as an important step “towards returning to our work in Libya”.  “We believe that working closely together with Eni and with Libya will allow us to bring forward restarting exploration in these promising areas,” he said in the statement.  The resumption of exploration would help boost Libya’s oil and gas output which fell sharply in the years following a civil war that started in 2011, Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi said. Libya is producing around 1.25 million barrels of oil per day (bopd), still below its pre-civil war capacity of 1.6 million bpd. BP does not produce any oil or gas in Libya. It signed the EPSA agreement in 2007 to explore onshore in the Ghadames basin and offshore in the Sirte basin. Its exploration program was interrupted in 2011 when the civil war broke out and remains under force majeure. In 2015, the company wrote off $432 million from its Libyan activities. Eni, which has been operating in Libya since 1959, is currently active in six contract areas in Libya and its production in 2017 reached a record 384,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.  The EPSA includes two onshore areas in the Ghadames basin and one in the offshore Sirte basin, covering a total area of around 54,000 square kilometers.

2018-10-08,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African department store chain Woolworths Holdings will remove single-use plastic bags from one of its stores during a six-month trial period in a bid to end plastic pollution, it said on Monday. From November, Woolworths, which also has operations in Australia and New Zealand, will not offer any plastic bags at its Steenberg store in Cape Town, with customers having the choice of either bringing their own sacks or paying 5.50 rand ($0.37) for a reusable bag.  South Africa does not have a law banning plastic bags. However, to reduce littering and discourage customers from buying them, South Africa increased the plastic bag levy in April by 50 percent to 12 cents per bag. Woolworths’ head of sustainability Feroz Koor said research had shown that the levy introduced in 2003 has not curbed the country’s plastic shopping bag consumption. He said the retailer aims to phase out plastic bags by 2020. “When you consider that Woolworths currently sells about 140 million plastic bags a year, which is between six to seven tonnes of plastic, helping consumers choose reusable bags will make a significant impact on reducing plastic waste,” Koor said in a statement. Supermarkets have come under increased pressure to cut their use of plastic as images of littered oceans and beaches become commonplace, shocking consumers and shareholders. The U.N. wants to eliminate single-use plastic by 2022 and says more than 60 countries have taken steps to ban or reduce plastic consumption. More than 40 other countries have banned, partly banned or taxed single use plastic bags, including China, France, Rwanda, and Italy. Kenya last year imposed the world’s toughest law against plastic bags - those breaking the law risk imprisonment of up to four years or fines of $40,000.

2018-10-08,"OSLO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Norway plans to step up spending on looking for oil and gas in the northern Barents Sea close to its border with Russia, the country’s 2019 budget showed on Monday. The government has proposed to allocate an extra 50 million Norwegian crowns ($6.04 million) to conduct a so-called 3D survey over a large geographical structure that straddles the border with Russia. “Knowledge is crucial both for good resource management and for safeguarding national economic interests,” Norway’s Oil and Energy Minister Kjell-Boerge Freiberg said in a statement. The country’s oil and energy ministry did not identify the structure, but said it was located in an area which is not yet opened up for petroleum exploration and development. A Reuters source familiar with the decision said the areas the government wanted to take a close look at were opposite exploration blocks awarded by Russia on the other side of the border. Russia’s largest oil producer Rosneft operates three blocks bordering Norway, information on the company’s website shows. Norway’s state-owned oil company Equinor, previously called Statoil, had plans to drill with Rosneft in one of the blocks, known as Perseyevsky. But Western sanctions imposed on Moscow after Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, have ended such plans. Oslo and Moscow did a deal in 2010 to end a dispute over their maritime border, which included oil and gas exploration. But since Russia’s annexation of Crimea Norwegian officials have expressed concern about Russian military exercises in the region. Norway also fears that tensions between Russia and the West could have implications for Svalbard, which belongs to Norway but has become significant because of growing interest in Arctic oil and gas.. Norwegian Petroleum Directorate said last year the area bordering Russia southeast of the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, which is not yet opened up for exploration, could hold 8.6 billion barrels of oil equivalents. The Directorate, which has previously conducted 2D surveys and drilled shallow wells to collect sediment samples, said there were a few large structures straddling the border with Russia, including Sentralbanken High. Seismic 3D surveys provide a three-dimensional and more detailed image of the subsurface. ($1 = 8.2828 Norwegian crowns) (Reporting by Nerijus Adomaitis.

2018-10-08,"DOHA, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Qatar Airways may consider a fuel surcharge on tickets to help it return to profit amid a regional dispute and rising oil prices, Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker told Reuters on Monday. Qatar Airways reported last month a 252 million riyal ($69 million) loss for the financial year ended March 31, citing a political dispute that has seen it banned from four Arab countries, and has suggested it could make a loss again. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt, and Bahrain have all banned Qatar Airways since June 2017 as part of a dispute they have with the government of Qatar. The airline has said it has mitigated the impact of the dispute by launching flights to new destinations, increasing flights on existing routes, and leasing aircraft to other airlines, and now hopes to return to profit in the 2018-2019 financial year. “We hope we will be able to move to profitability in the current financial year, even though the oil prices are rising,” said Baker. To do this, Baker said the airline might consider a fuel surcharge similar to those applied by other airlines. Carriers including Cathay Pacific and Malaysia Airlines have said this year they are adding a fuel surcharge to airfares as oil prices continue to rise. “Higher oil prices will put pressure on our bottom line, but this is our business - sometimes oil is higher, “ said Baker.

2018-10-08,"(Adds Equinor comments) OSLO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Norway has again revised up the estimated cost of developing the Martin Linge oil and gas field, which state-controlled Equinor bought from France’s Total last year, with the start-up delayed until 2020, according to the fiscal budget. The North Sea field is now expected to cost 47 billion crowns ($5.7 billion) to develop, up from the 41 billion crowns estimated last year, and 59 percent more than originally seen in 2012. The field’s start-up has also been pushed back to the first quarter of 2020 from the first half of 2019, the budget showed. Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, became the operator of the field in 2017 after buying a 51 percent stake from Total for $1.45 billion. Equinor confirmed the start-up delay in a separate statement, and said the cost increase was based on its assessment of the remaining work. Despite the increase, the company said it had managed to cut costs for its combined developments on the Norwegian continental shelf by 30 billion crowns compared with original estimates. The company has reduced costs at its Johan Sverdrup Phase 1 development by 30 percent alone to 86 billion crowns, it said. Norway’s fiscal budget showed the Phase 1 cost estimate reduced to 102.6 billion crowns from 124.6 billion in 2015. The two estimates are far apart because the budget and company treat exchange rate effects differently. The budget estimate also included costs for permanent reservoir monitoring and a polymer injection project at Johan Sverdrup, which the company included in capital spending for the Johan Sverdrup Phase 2 project, Equinor said. The overall cost reductions were mainly due to increased drilling efficiency, simplification and smooth project implementation, Margareth Oevrum, Equinor’s executive vice president for technology, projects and drilling, said in the statement. As of Sept. 1, there were 18 field developments on the Norwegian continental shelf, with approval pending for another three projects, the budget showed. $1 = 8.2789 Norwegian crowns

That’s down from at least 2.5 million bpd in April, before President Donald Trump in May withdrew the United States from a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and reimposed sanctions. The figure also marks a further fall from 1.6 million bpd in September. Tanker schedules are often adjusted and exports can vary week by week. The early October figures add to signs, however, that Iranian exports are falling more steeply than expected, stretching the ability of Saudi Arabia, non-OPEC Russia and other producers to fill the gap. “The U.S. government’s tough stance raised the stakes for a more significant Iran export loss than previously foreseen,” said Norbert Ruecker, head of macro and commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer. Oil prices have extended a rally on expectations the sanctions will test the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers. Brent crude LCOc1 on Wednesday last week reached $86.74 a barrel, the highest since 2014. None of the Iranian crude exported in the first week of October is heading for Europe, according to the Refinitiv data. The tankers are sailing to India, China and the Middle East. While Washington has said it wants to cut Iran’s oil exports to zero, Iran and Saudi Arabia say that is unlikely. The Trump administration is considering waivers on sanctions for countries that are reducing their imports. India, a major buyer, has ordered Iranian oil for November, although New Delhi does not yet know whether it will receive such a waiver. Iran has questioned whether the market needs more oil and says its output is holding steady at about 3.8 million bpd. Iran has pledged to block any OPEC supply increase that the country deems to be against its interest. “The market does not want a single barrel,” Iran’s representative on OPEC’s board of governors, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, told Reuters in late September. But figures OPEC compiles from secondary sources that include oil-industry media and government agencies put output in August at 3.58 million bpd, down 150,000 bpd from July. Some of these sources say output fell further in September. Iran may indeed have not cut production yet to match the rate of decline in its exports, as the country appears to be storing more oil on ships as it did during sanctions that applied until the 2015 nuclear deal.

2018-10-08,"* European markets down after China sell-off * Treasury yields at 7-year highs set tone * U.S. out for Columbus Day holiday By Virginia Furness LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - European markets fell heavily on Monday as investor confidence took a knock from last week’s spike in Treasury yields and from a Chinese market slump brought on by concerns that an escalating trade war with the United States could dent China’s growth. Chinese stocks returned from a week’s holiday to record their biggest one-day drop since February, with the Shanghai-Shenzhen CSI300 down more than 4 percent for only the second time in more than 2-1/2 years. This helped set the tone for the European open and stock markets fell with the pan-European index down 0.7 percent and Germany’s DAX 0.8 percent lower. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell 0.34 percent. The fall in global equities boosted demand for the dollar as investors rushed for safety. Against a basket of its rivals the greenback rose 0.3 percent, edging towards a 14-month high hit in mid-August. Investor fears of higher U.S. interest rates, global protectionism, emerging market weakness and an Italian budget row have all combined to send equities sharply into the red in October, with world stocks down more than 2 percent already. The dark mood in China sent shivers across Asian markets and will add to investors nervousness - the MSCI benchmark emerging markets index dropped 0.7 percent to its lowest level since May 2017, and is now down 22 percent from January’s peaks. Growth concerns led the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) on Sunday to cut the level of cash that banks must hold as reserves, aimed at lowering financing costs as policymakers worry about the fallout from the tariff row with the United States. “China just cut reserve requirement ratios and expanded monetary policy, which is a response to the fact that China’s economy is slowing down but the market doesn’t believe there is enough stimulus to cut the slowdown,” said Guillermo Felices, a senior strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management, calling the current concerns markets face a “powerful cocktail”. “They’ve injected more liquidity into the market to contain the slowdown, which has already translated into weaker equity prices.” The Chinese slide comes after U.S. Treasury yields hit seven-year highs on Friday following strong data that signalled a continued tightening of the labour market and increased inflationary pressures - adding to the reasons for the U.S. Federal Reserve to continue with its hiking cycle. U.S. trading is likely to be muted on Monday, with markets closed for Columbus Day. Renewed concerns over Italy’s budget also added to the risk-off tone in European equities. The FTSE MIB skidded 2.2 percent to its lowest since 21 April 2017, as government bonds yields hit new highs, putting pressure on bank shares. The European Commission has told Italy it is concerned about its budget deficit plans for the next three years since they breach what the EU asked the country to do in July, but Rome insisted on Saturday it would “not retreat” from its spending plans. Italy’s 10-year government bond hit fresh four and a half year highs on Monday. As a result the euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.1480, close to its lowest since Aug, 20. “We are a bit surprised by the strength of the reaction in bond markets, but it appears the market is jumping to the conclusion that the European Commission will take a hardline stance when Italy submits its budget,” said Mizuho rates strategist Antoine Bouvet. Germany’s 10-year government bond, the benchmark for the region, remains close to four-month highs at 0.559 percent . Oil dropped back to $83.27 per barrel after Washington said it may grant waivers to sanctions against Iran’s oil exports next month, and as Saudi Arabia was said to be replacing any potential shortfall from Iran.

2018-10-08,"WARSAW (Reuters) - The United States will be “very active” at December’s U.N. climate discussions even though Donald Trump pulled out of the global accord, the incoming Polish chairman of the talks said. “The U.S. delegation will appear in Katowice and for sure will be very active, that was confirmed during the talks I had on this subject in Washington,” Michal Kurtyka told Reuters. Kurtyka, a former Polish deputy energy minister, said that although the United States had said it would quit the 2015 Paris Agreement, this would “formally only be possible in 2020”.  While the accord set a sweeping goal of ending the fossil fuel era this century, its text was vague on details. A U.N. report on Monday warned that temperatures are likely to rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2030 and 2052 if global warming continues at its current pace and if the world fails to take rapid and unprecedented measures to stem the increase. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) met last week in Incheon, South Korea to finalize the report, which is seen as the main scientific guide for government policymakers on how to implement the Paris Agreement. This will form a key part of the agenda for environment ministers from almost 200 governments when they meet in Katowice, the heart of Poland’s coal-producing region, Silesia. Kurtyka said that a U.N. meeting in Bangkok in September was a “turning point” when it comes to how the negotiating parties will try to reach a “good result” in Katowice, but a number of sticking points still has to be resolved, including how to finance reducing climate change. A surge in carbon emission prices had influenced the Bangkok talks, Kurtyka said. Carbon prices have more than doubled this year, with utilities ramping up hedging ahead of supply cuts coming into effect from 2019 and as more speculative traders entered the market. “The increase itself is not surprising. What is surprising is the fact that it happened in such a short time. The question is to what extent it reflects the economic fundamentals and to what extend this is a pure market game,” Kurtyka said.  The sudden increase of carbon price is unlikely though to accelerate decisions regarding new low-emission energy projects in Poland, Kurtyka said.  “I assume that a long-term energy policy will be presented by the end of this year, including potential decisions regarding photovoltaic or offshore wind,” he added. Poland generates most of its electricity from carbon-emitting coal, but plans to reduce it to 50 percent of its energy mix by 2040.

2018-10-08,"WARSAW, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Polish oil refiner PKN Orlen expects to receive a first ever shipment of Nigerian crude oil next month, its CEO said, as Poland seeks to reduce its reliance on Russian supplies. State-run PKN Orlen, Poland’s biggest refiner, and smaller rival Lotos, which it is taking over, rely mostly on Russian oil delivered via pipelines built in the 1960s but both have increased purchases from other sources. “Nigeria is our new source of supplies we are exploring. Currently, a batch of 130,000 tonnes of Nigerian oil is on its way to Poland. It is expected to arrive at Naftoport (in Gdansk) in mid-October,” PKN’s Chief Executive Daniel Obajtek told Reuters in an interview last week. “If tests confirm the assumed yields structure and margins, further oil supplies from Nigeria will be a viable option,” he said. PKN Orlen signed a long-term agreement on regular oil supplies with Saudi Aramco in 2016 and since then both PKN and Lotos have also purchased oil from Iran and the United States. Oil supplies from Russia account for around 70 percent of all oil deliveries to PKN, down from around 90 percent in 2015. “There are also tankers sailing to us from other new directions, but at this stage it is too early to talk about it. We are holding discussions on medium- and long-term oil supply contracts with a number of parties, including US partners,” Obajtek also said. Obajtek said that the deteriorating quality of Russian Urals crude was also prompting PKN to diversify its supplies. “Generally, the lower quality may impact contract prices, as it affects our yields,” Obajtek said but declined to comment on whether PKN is negotiating new contract prices. PKN Orlen is taking over Lotos as part of a plan announced in February to improve its negotiating position in oil purchases and to increase investment capacity. Obajtek said that he hoped to obtain clearance from the European Commission by mid-2019. “We are in the pre-notification phase and we are preparing to submit a merger clearance application, with some guidance already in place. We intend to file a draft application by the end of the year, which will formally trigger the process of negotiations with the European Commission,” Obajtek said. “We are not a threat to the European market. We have a market share of around four percent in Europe, while companies like Shell, BP or Total have much bigger market shares. And these companies obtained clearance for various mergers,” he added. PKN plans to buy 32.99 percent of Lotos shares from the state, possibly in the third or fourth quarter of 2019. Then, most likely by the end of 2019, PKN will announce a tender offer for up to 66 percent of Lotos shares. “Of course, the greatest synergy opportunities will come after the consolidation is complete and after we have taken full control of Lotos,” Obajtek said. PKN Orlen has been working on the construction of 1.2 gigawatt (GW) offshore wind farms, at the Baltic Sea. “However, our experience in this area is limited, and we want to avoid costly mistakes. Therefore, we do not rule out cooperation with a partner that would bring the know-how,” Obajtek said. “I would rather not specify whether we are considering a Polish or a foreign partner, but it is worth mentioning that there is no Polish company that could offer much valuable experience in this respect”. Obajtek, a former chief executive of state-run utility Energa, was appointed PKN Orlen CEO in February and says the company is buying a greater share of products from Polish manufacturers. “Being a champion of the economy is a commitment,” Obajtek said, “as we seek to build our business in a way that would strengthen the economy of our country”.

2018-10-08,"* U.N. report to guide governments on meeting Paris targets * Report affirms meeting 1.5C rise target better than 2C * Exceeding 1.5C rise would demand removing CO2 * Global sea level to rise less with a 1.5C hike (Adds IPCC vice chair comments in paragraph 6) By Nina Chestney and Jane Chung LONDON/INCHEON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Society would have to enact “unprecedented” changes to how it consumes energy, travels and builds to meet a lower global warming target or it risks increases in heat waves, flood-causing storms and the chances of drought in some regions as well as the loss of species, a U.N. report said on Monday. Keeping the Earth’s temperature rise to only 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) rather than the 2C target agreed to at the Paris Agreement talks in 2015, would have “clear benefits to people and natural ecosystems,” the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said on Monday in a statement announcing the report’s release. The IPCC report said at the current rate of warming, the world’s temperatures would likely reach 1.5C between 2030 and 2052 after an increase of 1C above pre-industrial levels since the mid-1800s. Keeping the 1.5C target would keep the global sea level rise 0.1 metre (3.9 inches) lower by 2100 than a 2C target, the report states. That could reduce flooding and give the people that inhabit the world’s coasts, islands and river deltas time to adapt to climate change. The lower target would also reduce species loss and extinction and the impact on terrestrial, freshwater and coastal ecosystems, the report said. “There were doubts if we would be able to differentiate impacts set at 1.5C and that came so clearly. Even the scientists were surprised to see how much science was already there and how much they could really differentiate and how great are the benefits of limiting global warming at 1.5 compared to 2,” Thelma Krug, vice-chair of the IPCC, told Reuters in an interview. “And now more than ever we know that every bit of warming matters,” Krug said. The IPCC met last week in Incheon, South Korea to finalise the report, prepared at the request of governments in 2015 to assess the feasibility and importance of limiting global warming to 1.5C. The report is seen as the main scientific guide for government policymakers on how to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement during the Katowice Climate Change Conference in Poland in December. To contain warming at 1.5C, man-made global net carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions would need to fall by about 45 percent by 2030 from 2010 levels and reach “net zero” by mid-century. Any additional emissions would require removing CO2 from the air. The report summary said renewable energy would need to supply 70 percent to 85 percent of electricity by 2050 to stay within a 1.5C limit, compared with about 25 percent now. Using carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, the share of gas-fired power would need to be cut to 8 percent and coal to under 2 percent. There was no mention of oil in this context in the summary. If the average global temperature temporarily exceeded 1.5C, additional carbon removal techniques would be required to return warming to below 1.5C by 2100. But the report said the efficacy of measures, such as planting forests, bioenergy use or capturing and storing CO2, were unproven at a large scale and carried some risks. But the effects of not meeting the 1.5C target would mean huge changes to the world. The lower level would mean the Arctic Ocean would be free of sea ice in summer only once per century not at least once a decade under the higher target. Coral reefs would decline by a still unsustainable 70 percent to 90 percent instead of being virtually wiped out under the higher increase. “The report shows that we only have the slimmest of opportunities remaining to avoid unthinkable damage to the climate system that supports life as we know it,” said Amjad Abdulla, the IPCC board member and chief negotiator for an alliance of small island states at risk of flooding as sea levels rise.

2018-10-08,"MELBOURNE, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Macquarie Group said on Monday it has agreed to help back an ambitious A$22 billion ($16 billion) solar and wind power project in outback Australia that could eventually provide power to Indonesia, as well as big miners and hydrogen projects. The project, called the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, is looking to build 11 gigawatts (GW) of power capacity, with more than half to be allocated to energy users and potential hydrogen producers in northwestern Australia. Macquarie has agreed to provide development capital and take an equity stake in the project, alongside Danish wind turbines giant Vestas and privately owned Intercontinental Energy and CWP Energy Asia, the Asian Renewable Energy Hub said in a statement. A Macquarie spokesman declined to comment on the size of the stake or provide further details of the group’s involvement. “From our perspective, it’s a vote of confidence in the project,” CWP Renewables spokesman Andrew Dickson said of Macquarie’s participation. The project, which has been in the planning stages since 2014, aims to win environmental approval from the state of Western Australia by the end of 2019 and secure financing around 2021. The wind and solar hub would be built in phases over six or seven years. “It really depends on offtakes. We’ve got multiple paths to market,” Dickson said. At 11 GW, the project would be equivalent to nearly 20 percent of Australia’s current total power generation capacity. $1 = 1.4162 Australian dollars

European markets were also set to weaken, with financial spreadbetters expecting the FTSE to open 0.07 percent lower, Frankfurt’s DAX down 0.03 percent, and Paris’ CAC down 0.1 percent. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) on Sunday cut the level of cash that banks must hold as reserves, aimed at lowering financing costs as policymakers worry about fallout from the tariff row with the United States. Reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) - currently 15.5 percent for large commercial lenders and 13.5 percent for smaller banks - will be cut by 100 basis points effective Oct. 15, the PBOC said, matching a similar-sized move in April. Asian shares were also hit on Monday as investors in Chinese stocks reacted for the first time to new pressure from Washington and a report that Chinese spies had compromised U.S. hardware. At 0540 GMT, China’s blue-chip CSI300 index was 3.5 percent lower while the main Shanghai Composite Index was down 2.9 percent. The tech-heavy ChiNext board fell 3.08 percent. The losses in China dragged down MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, which was 0.9 percent lower. James McGlew, executive director of corporate stockbroking at Argonaut Ltd. in Brisbane, said Chinese investors were catching up after global markets turned lower during China’s week-long National Day holiday. “That is exacerbated by the fact that you would have had quite a few long positions going into that time-off and people just quit them and were hitting the bid today,” he said. “We’ve been expecting for some time now the U.S. market to start delivering volatility. We find it quite difficult to reconcile the political machinations that are going on over there being friendly to markets.” On Thursday, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence highlighted disputes with China on issues such as cyber attacks, Taiwan, freedom of the seas and human rights, marking a sharpened U.S. approach toward Beijing beyond the trade war. On Friday, Chinese technology stocks listed in Hong Kong slumped on a Bloomberg report that the systems of multiple U.S. companies had been compromised by malicious computer chips inserted by Chinese spies. On Monday, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was down 0.5 percent and a sub-index tracking information technology firms was 0.9  percent lower. China’s yuan was weaker at 6.8981 per U.S. dollar at 0519 GMT, compared with a previous onshore close of 6.8725 per dollar. Earlier on Monday, the PBOC set the midpoint of the yuan’s daily trading band at 6.8957 per dollar, its weakest level since May 11, 2017. The offshore yuan was also weaker at 6.9050 per dollar. Higher yields on U.S. Treasuries are likely to put more pressure on the yuan as China continues to make use of targeted policy easing to energise the domestic economy. “We expect the PBoC will continue its easing efforts to keep liquidity ample and loosen its credit control to make funds more accessible to the broader economy,” BofA Merrill Lynch analysts said in a note. “Moreover, there is still room for further RRR cuts when necessary, though the chance for an interest rate cut is limited given the continued Fed rate hiking cycle, in our view.” On Monday, the spread between Chinese and U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds was 58.1 basis points according to Eikon data, compared with 150 basis points at the end of 2017. Equity markets around the world came under pressure last week after a steep sell-off in U.S. Treasuries, prompted by hawkish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials and data widely seen as supporting further U.S. rate hikes. Friday’s U.S. non-farm payrolls showed job creation slowed in September, likely from Hurricane Florence’s impact on restaurant and retail payrolls, but the Labor Department report also showed a rise in wages that could keep the Federal Reserve on track for more interest rate hikes. Investors are also keeping an eye on Brazil after right-wing Congressman Jair Bolsonaro won nearly half the votes in Brazil’s first-round presidential election on Sunday, marking a major shift to the right in Latin America’s largest nation fuelled by voters’ anger at corruption. In currency markets, the dollar was 0.1 percent stronger against the yen at 113.83, while the euro was 0.1 percent weaker against the dollar at $1.1512. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was up 0.09 percent at 95.707. Oil prices fell more than 1 percent after the U.S. said it may grant waivers to sanctions against Iran’s oil exports next month, and as Saudi Arabia was said to be replacing any potential shortfall from Iran. U.S. crude was down 0.7 percent at $73.80 a barrel. Brent crude fell 0.9 percent to $83.38 per barrel. Spot gold fell 0.5 percent to $1,196.51 per ounce.

2018-10-08,"(Updates with additional quotes) By Jarrett Renshaw Oct 8 (Reuters) - Irving Oil Corp shut its Saint John refinery in the Canadian province of New Brunswick on Monday morning after an explosion and a major fire that followed, with photos showing flames and smoke billowing from the complex. The company said on Twitter it was dealing with a “major incident” at the 320,000 barrel-per-day refinery, but that all of its employees and contractors have been accounted for, none of them seriously injured. Saint John Regional Hospital treated and released five people with minor injuries as a result of the explosion, according to Horizon Health, operator of the hospital. “I heard a loud bang that shook our house and rattled the windows,” said Gordon Dalzell, who lives in Saint John near the refinery. He said he and others saw a “very large black sooty plume of smoke” from their street. Energy intelligence service Genscape reported the fire appeared to have occurred near the catalytic reformer. The crude section, catalytic reformer and a cogeneration unit were shut following the incident, Genscape reported, adding that multiple units were already offline for maintenance. The company shut most of the plant for planned maintenance in late September, but the smaller, 25,000 bpd gasoline-making units and the 125,000 bpd crude unit were still running, a source familiar with the plant’s operations said. The source said he believed the explosion was within the section of the plant that houses the hydrogen unit. More than one-half of the finished products from the refinery are exported to the U.S. Northeast, according to Irving’s website. Reports of the fire sparked a rally in futures in refined products; gasoline was up about 2 percent following the reports but subsequently was only 0.4 percent higher.

2018-10-08,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil prices almost fully recovered from a sharp drop on Monday, paring losses as investors bet China’s economic stimulus moves would lift crude demand in the world’s No. 2 economy.  Traders sent global benchmark Brent crude tumbling below $83 per barrel early in the session after China’s central bank on Sunday slashed lenders’ reserve requirements, a signal Beijing is working to maintain economic growth. “The reaction by the Chinese to the slowdown there is a salve the market started to price back in,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York.  Brent crude LCOc1 hit a session low of $82.66 but settled just 25 cents lower at $83.91 per barrel. Brent hit a four-year high of $86.74 last week.  U.S. crude CLc1 had fallen to a session low of $73.07 per barrel but climbed back up to settle at $74.29, just 5 cents lower.   Traders said oil prices also got a boost from a new report showing a small drop in oil inventories last week at the main U.S. storage hub at Cushing, Oklahoma.  Cushing storage levels were about 28.5 million barrels on Friday, market intelligence firm Genscape reported, according to traders who saw the report. They said that was down 15,000 barrels from what Genscape reported earlier in the week. The report of a small crude decline eased fears that had pressured oil prices after U.S. government data on Wednesday showed a large build in the U.S. commercial crude stockpile.  Also pressuring oil below $83 a barrel in early trade were reports that some Iranian oil exports will keep flowing after the U.S. re-imposes sanctions. Last week, Saudi Arabia announced plans to lift crude output next month to 10.7 million barrels per day (bpd), the kingdom’s highest level ever.  Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh on Monday called a Saudi claim that the kingdom could replace Iran’s crude exports “nonsense.”  “Iran’s oil cannot be replaced by Saudi Arabia nor any other country,” Zanganeh said, according to his ministry’s website. On Monday, Gulf of Mexico oil companies shut down 19 percent of oil production as Hurricane Michael moved toward eastern Gulf states including Florida. If current forecasts prove accurate, the hurricane would largely miss major producing assets in the Gulf, analysts said.  However, “if the storm wobbles at all, it’ll be a direct hit on Gulf of Mexico producing assets,” Kilduff said.

European markets slid, with defensive stocks under pressure as investor confidence took a knock from last week’s spike in Treasury yields and amid heightened expectations for further interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed down 1.14 percent, it’s biggest one-day drop in a month, while MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.32 percent. The United States remains concerned about China’s recent currency depreciation, a senior Treasury official said, adding that it was unclear whether Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would meet with any Chinese officials this week. Washington last month slapped tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, which prompted Beijing to retaliate with duties on $60 billion worth of U.S. products. Beijing moved over the weekend to spur more lending. Spot yuan slid to its lowest official close in seven weeks against the dollar on expectations of more easing by China. Wall Street was mixed on a day the U.S. bond market was closed because of the Columbus Day holiday. Fear of slowing growth led to a drop in high-flying stocks that have led the U.S. equity rally. The biggest decliners were technology stocks, which tumbled 1.45 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 31.97 points, or 0.12 percent, to 26,479.02. The S&P 500 gained 0.41 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,885.98 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 42.66 points, or 0.55 percent, to 7,745.79. Chinese stocks fell in their biggest one-day drop since February after markets re-opened following a week-long holiday in China, with the Shanghai-Shenzhen CSI 300 index down more than 4 percent for only the second time in more than 2-1/2 years. For the year, Chinese indexes are down about 18 percent. Yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note were at seven-year highs, after a solid jobs report last week raised the likelihood of faster interest rate hikes. “There’s a hangover from last week’s rapid move in yields and just because the bond market’s closed, doesn’t mean investors are not worried,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. The yield on Italian government 10-year bonds rose nearly 20 basis points to 3.60 percent, the highest since February 2014, while Italy’s FTSE MIB index fell 2.4 percent to its lowest in more than 17 months. Italy’s stock market index fell 2.4 percent to its weakest since April 2017. Brazil’s real currency hit a two-month high and stocks jumped after market-preferred presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro’s strong first-round win on Sunday boosted investor confidence. The real shot up 2.5 percent and the Bovespa index jumped 4.4 percent. Gold fell more than 1 percent as investors sought refuge in the dollar, which has been lifted by recent strong U.S. economic data that have reinforced rate hike expectations. Gold is down more than 12 percent from an April peak largely due to a strong dollar, which reflects a vibrant U.S. economy, rising U.S. rates and fears of a global trade war. U.S. gold futures settled down 1.41 percent at $1,188.60 an ounce. “We are seeing some strength in the dollar index and some weakness in the equity market and it doesn’t appear that investors are going for safety in the gold markets at all,” said Phil Streible, senior commodities strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago. The dollar index rose 0.13 percent, with the euro down 0.3 percent to $1.1488. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.65 percent versus the greenback at 112.98. Oil dropped, pressured by expectations that some Iranian oil exports will keep flowing after the U.S. re-imposes sanctions, easing a strain on supplies. U.S. crude settled down 5 cents at $74.29 a barrel and Brent fell 25 cents to settle at $83.91. Reporting by Herbert Lash,

2018-10-08,"(Adds price action and analyst quote) By Rania El Gamal and Ron Bousso ABU DHABI/LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Baker Hughes, the world’s second-largest oil services company, will take a 5 percent stake in Abu Dhabi National Oil Company’s (ADNOC) drilling unit for $550 million under a tie-up announced on Monday. Baker Hughes (BHGE) becomes the first foreign company to take a stake in one of state-owned ADNOC’s services companies under the agreement which values ADNOC Drilling at about $11 billion. It will allow Baker Hughes to cement its presence in the Middle East, the fastest growing region for oil and gas operations, and enable ADNOC Drilling to gain access to the know-how and technical expertise of a global player. Since its acquisition by General Electric Co last year, Baker Hughes has sought new business models following a sharp decline in global drilling activity since 2014. That includes offering a suite of services to oil and gas producers from exploration to drilling. “To us this is not just another partnership... this will allow ADNOC Drilling to be not only a local player but a global specialist in the drilling and oil service business,” ADNOC’s Chief Executive Sultan al-Jaber told Reuters in an interview in Abu Dhabi. It would help make ADNOC Drilling “the most efficient and the most competitive,” al-Jaber said. Baker Hughes’ CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said BHGE will have a representative on the board of ADNOC Drilling and will create a dedicated training team. The partnership will offer drilling services in the UAE and possibly abroad as well, al-Jaber said. The transaction is expected to close before the end of this year, with operations starting in 2019, ADNOC and BHGE said in a joint statement. Al-Jaber said “there are no plans at this point of time” to float a stake in ADNOC Drilling. While analysts said the deal would bode well for Baker Hughes’ long-term prospects in the United Arab Emirates, some lamented that the firm was paying too high a price in its acquisition. “We’re just not fans of OFS (oilfield service) companies having to ante up” to tap into revenue growth, analysts for investment firm Tudor Pickering Holt & Co wrote in a note on Monday. Shares of Baker Hughes were down roughly 1 percent at midday on Monday, trading around $31.65. Moelis is acting as the financial adviser to ADNOC on the transaction, while Citi is the adviser to BHGE, the two companies said in the statement.

2018-10-08,"MAPUTO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The Mozambican government said on Monday it had signed oil exploration agreements with U.S. energy firm Exxon Mobil and Russia’s Rosneft. Mozambique’s National Petroleum Institute, an energy regulator in the southern African country, said the government was preparing to sign similar agreements with South Africa’s Sasol and Italy’s Eni. The agreements could lead to as much as $700 million of investment in Mozambique as the energy firms are expected to drill a minimum of 10 wells, eight in deep water and two onshore, the institute added. The firms earlier won oil tenders as part of Mozambique’s fifth licensing round in 2014. Heavily-indebted Mozambique is hoping its oil and natural gas resources will help it recover from a debt scandal that saw it cut off from multilateral and foreign donors. More than $30 billion is expected to be invested in Mozambique’s gas sector to build capacity to produce 20 million tonnes per year of liquefied natural gas.

2018-10-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Italy’s Eni has agreed to buy half of BP’s 85 percent stake in a Libyan oil and gas license with the aim of resuming exploration next year, the companies said on Monday. Eni will acquire the 42.5 percent stake and become the operator of the exploration and production sharing agreement (EPSA) in Libya, in which the Libyan Investment Authority holds the remaining 15 percent, the companies said in a statement. The companies, along with state-owned National Oil Corp (NOC), signed a letter of intent in London on Monday paving the way for the final deal. They did not disclose financial terms of the transaction.  NOC chairman Mustafa Sanalla said the agreement showed renewed confidence in the war-torn country’s oil and gas sector. “This agreement is a clear signal and recognition by the market of the opportunities Libya has to offer and will only serve to strengthen our production outlook,” he said.  BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley hailed the deal as an important step “towards returning to our work in Libya”.  “We believe that working closely together with Eni and with Libya will allow us to bring forward restarting exploration in these promising areas,” he said in the statement.  The resumption of exploration would help boost Libya’s oil and gas output which fell sharply in the years following a civil war that started in 2011, Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi said. Libya is producing around 1.25 million barrels of oil per day (bopd), still below its pre-civil war capacity of 1.6 million bpd. BP does not produce any oil or gas in Libya. It signed the EPSA agreement in 2007 to explore onshore in the Ghadames basin and offshore in the Sirte basin. Its exploration program was interrupted in 2011 when the civil war broke out and remains under force majeure. In 2015, the company wrote off $432 million from its Libyan activities. Eni, which has been operating in Libya since 1959, is currently active in six contract areas in Libya and its production in 2017 reached a record 384,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.  The EPSA includes two onshore areas in the Ghadames basin and one in the offshore Sirte basin, covering a total area of around 54,000 square kilometers.

2018-10-08,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African department store chain Woolworths Holdings will remove single-use plastic bags from one of its stores during a six-month trial period in a bid to end plastic pollution, it said on Monday. From November, Woolworths, which also has operations in Australia and New Zealand, will not offer any plastic bags at its Steenberg store in Cape Town, with customers having the choice of either bringing their own sacks or paying 5.50 rand ($0.37) for a reusable bag.  South Africa does not have a law banning plastic bags. However, to reduce littering and discourage customers from buying them, South Africa increased the plastic bag levy in April by 50 percent to 12 cents per bag. Woolworths’ head of sustainability Feroz Koor said research had shown that the levy introduced in 2003 has not curbed the country’s plastic shopping bag consumption. He said the retailer aims to phase out plastic bags by 2020. “When you consider that Woolworths currently sells about 140 million plastic bags a year, which is between six to seven tonnes of plastic, helping consumers choose reusable bags will make a significant impact on reducing plastic waste,” Koor said in a statement. Supermarkets have come under increased pressure to cut their use of plastic as images of littered oceans and beaches become commonplace, shocking consumers and shareholders. The U.N. wants to eliminate single-use plastic by 2022 and says more than 60 countries have taken steps to ban or reduce plastic consumption. More than 40 other countries have banned, partly banned or taxed single use plastic bags, including China, France, Rwanda, and Italy. Kenya last year imposed the world’s toughest law against plastic bags - those breaking the law risk imprisonment of up to four years or fines of $40,000.

2018-10-08,"OSLO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Norway plans to step up spending on looking for oil and gas in the northern Barents Sea close to its border with Russia, the country’s 2019 budget showed on Monday. The government has proposed to allocate an extra 50 million Norwegian crowns ($6.04 million) to conduct a so-called 3D survey over a large geographical structure that straddles the border with Russia. “Knowledge is crucial both for good resource management and for safeguarding national economic interests,” Norway’s Oil and Energy Minister Kjell-Boerge Freiberg said in a statement. The country’s oil and energy ministry did not identify the structure, but said it was located in an area which is not yet opened up for petroleum exploration and development. A Reuters source familiar with the decision said the areas the government wanted to take a close look at were opposite exploration blocks awarded by Russia on the other side of the border. Russia’s largest oil producer Rosneft operates three blocks bordering Norway, information on the company’s website shows. Norway’s state-owned oil company Equinor, previously called Statoil, had plans to drill with Rosneft in one of the blocks, known as Perseyevsky. But Western sanctions imposed on Moscow after Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, have ended such plans. Oslo and Moscow did a deal in 2010 to end a dispute over their maritime border, which included oil and gas exploration. But since Russia’s annexation of Crimea Norwegian officials have expressed concern about Russian military exercises in the region. Norway also fears that tensions between Russia and the West could have implications for Svalbard, which belongs to Norway but has become significant because of growing interest in Arctic oil and gas.. Norwegian Petroleum Directorate said last year the area bordering Russia southeast of the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, which is not yet opened up for exploration, could hold 8.6 billion barrels of oil equivalents. The Directorate, which has previously conducted 2D surveys and drilled shallow wells to collect sediment samples, said there were a few large structures straddling the border with Russia, including Sentralbanken High.

2018-10-08,"DOHA, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Qatar Airways may consider a fuel surcharge on tickets to help it return to profit amid a regional dispute and rising oil prices, Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker told Reuters on Monday. Qatar Airways reported last month a 252 million riyal ($69 million) loss for the financial year ended March 31, citing a political dispute that has seen it banned from four Arab countries, and has suggested it could make a loss again. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt, and Bahrain have all banned Qatar Airways since June 2017 as part of a dispute they have with the government of Qatar. The airline has said it has mitigated the impact of the dispute by launching flights to new destinations, increasing flights on existing routes, and leasing aircraft to other airlines, and now hopes to return to profit in the 2018-2019 financial year. “We hope we will be able to move to profitability in the current financial year, even though the oil prices are rising,” said Baker. To do this, Baker said the airline might consider a fuel surcharge similar to those applied by other airlines. Carriers including Cathay Pacific and Malaysia Airlines have said this year they are adding a fuel surcharge to airfares as oil prices continue to rise. “Higher oil prices will put pressure on our bottom line, but this is our business - sometimes oil is higher, “ said Baker.

2018-10-08,"(Adds Equinor comments) OSLO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Norway has again revised up the estimated cost of developing the Martin Linge oil and gas field, which state-controlled Equinor bought from France’s Total last year, with the start-up delayed until 2020, according to the fiscal budget. The North Sea field is now expected to cost 47 billion crowns ($5.7 billion) to develop, up from the 41 billion crowns estimated last year, and 59 percent more than originally seen in 2012. The field’s start-up has also been pushed back to the first quarter of 2020 from the first half of 2019, the budget showed. Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, became the operator of the field in 2017 after buying a 51 percent stake from Total for $1.45 billion. Equinor confirmed the start-up delay in a separate statement, and said the cost increase was based on its assessment of the remaining work. Despite the increase, the company said it had managed to cut costs for its combined developments on the Norwegian continental shelf by 30 billion crowns compared with original estimates. The company has reduced costs at its Johan Sverdrup Phase 1 development by 30 percent alone to 86 billion crowns, it said. Norway’s fiscal budget showed the Phase 1 cost estimate reduced to 102.6 billion crowns from 124.6 billion in 2015. The two estimates are far apart because the budget and company treat exchange rate effects differently. The budget estimate also included costs for permanent reservoir monitoring and a polymer injection project at Johan Sverdrup, which the company included in capital spending for the Johan Sverdrup Phase 2 project, Equinor said. The overall cost reductions were mainly due to increased drilling efficiency, simplification and smooth project implementation, Margareth Oevrum, Equinor’s executive vice president for technology, projects and drilling, said in the statement. As of Sept. 1, there were 18 field developments on the Norwegian continental shelf, with approval pending for another three projects, the budget showed. $1 = 8.2789 Norwegian crowns

2018-10-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran’s crude exports fell further in the first week of October, according to tanker data and an industry source, taking a major hit from U.S. sanctions and throwing a challenge to other OPEC oil producers as they seek to cover the shortfall. The Islamic Republic exported 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in that seven-day period, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. An industry source who also tracks exports said October shipments were so far below 1 million bpd. That’s down from at least 2.5 million bpd in April, before President Donald Trump in May withdrew the United States from a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and reimposed sanctions. The figure also marks a further fall from 1.6 million bpd in September. Tanker schedules are often adjusted and exports can vary week by week. The early October figures add to signs, however, that Iranian exports are falling more steeply than expected, stretching the ability of Saudi Arabia, non-OPEC Russia and other producers to fill the gap. “The U.S. government’s tough stance raised the stakes for a more significant Iran export loss than previously foreseen,” said Norbert Ruecker, head of macro and commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer. Oil prices have extended a rally on expectations the sanctions will test the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers. Brent crude LCOc1 on Wednesday last week reached $86.74 a barrel, the highest since 2014. None of the Iranian crude exported in the first week of October is heading for Europe, according to the Refinitiv data. The tankers are sailing to India, China and the Middle East. While Washington has said it wants to cut Iran’s oil exports to zero, Iran and Saudi Arabia say that is unlikely. The Trump administration is considering waivers on sanctions for countries that are reducing their imports. India, a major buyer, has ordered Iranian oil for November, although New Delhi does not yet know whether it will receive such a waiver. Iran has questioned whether the market needs more oil and says its output is holding steady at about 3.8 million bpd. Iran has pledged to block any OPEC supply increase that the country deems to be against its interest. “The market does not want a single barrel,” Iran’s representative on OPEC’s board of governors, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, told Reuters in late September. But figures OPEC compiles from secondary sources that include oil-industry media and government agencies put output in August at 3.58 million bpd, down 150,000 bpd from July. Some of these sources say output fell further in September. Iran may indeed have not cut production yet to match the rate of decline in its exports, as the country appears to be storing more oil on ships as it did during sanctions that applied until the 2015 nuclear deal.

2018-10-08,"* European markets down after China sell-off * Treasury yields at 7-year highs set tone * U.S. out for Columbus Day holiday By Virginia Furness LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - European markets fell heavily on Monday as investor confidence took a knock from last week’s spike in Treasury yields and from a Chinese market slump brought on by concerns that an escalating trade war with the United States could dent China’s growth. Chinese stocks returned from a week’s holiday to record their biggest one-day drop since February, with the Shanghai-Shenzhen CSI300 down more than 4 percent for only the second time in more than 2-1/2 years. This helped set the tone for the European open and stock markets fell with the pan-European index down 0.7 percent and Germany’s DAX 0.8 percent lower. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell 0.34 percent. The fall in global equities boosted demand for the dollar as investors rushed for safety. Against a basket of its rivals the greenback rose 0.3 percent, edging towards a 14-month high hit in mid-August. Investor fears of higher U.S. interest rates, global protectionism, emerging market weakness and an Italian budget row have all combined to send equities sharply into the red in October, with world stocks down more than 2 percent already. The dark mood in China sent shivers across Asian markets and will add to investors nervousness - the MSCI benchmark emerging markets index dropped 0.7 percent to its lowest level since May 2017, and is now down 22 percent from January’s peaks. Growth concerns led the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) on Sunday to cut the level of cash that banks must hold as reserves, aimed at lowering financing costs as policymakers worry about the fallout from the tariff row with the United States. “China just cut reserve requirement ratios and expanded monetary policy, which is a response to the fact that China’s economy is slowing down but the market doesn’t believe there is enough stimulus to cut the slowdown,” said Guillermo Felices, a senior strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management, calling the current concerns markets face a “powerful cocktail”. “They’ve injected more liquidity into the market to contain the slowdown, which has already translated into weaker equity prices.” The Chinese slide comes after U.S. Treasury yields hit seven-year highs on Friday following strong data that signalled a continued tightening of the labour market and increased inflationary pressures - adding to the reasons for the U.S. Federal Reserve to continue with its hiking cycle. U.S. trading is likely to be muted on Monday, with markets closed for Columbus Day. Renewed concerns over Italy’s budget also added to the risk-off tone in European equities. The FTSE MIB skidded 2.2 percent to its lowest since 21 April 2017, as government bonds yields hit new highs, putting pressure on bank shares. The European Commission has told Italy it is concerned about its budget deficit plans for the next three years since they breach what the EU asked the country to do in July, but Rome insisted on Saturday it would “not retreat” from its spending plans. Italy’s 10-year government bond hit fresh four and a half year highs on Monday. As a result the euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.1480, close to its lowest since Aug, 20. “We are a bit surprised by the strength of the reaction in bond markets, but it appears the market is jumping to the conclusion that the European Commission will take a hardline stance when Italy submits its budget,” said Mizuho rates strategist Antoine Bouvet. Germany’s 10-year government bond, the benchmark for the region, remains close to four-month highs at 0.559 percent . Oil dropped back to $83.27 per barrel after Washington said it may grant waivers to sanctions against Iran’s oil exports next month, and as Saudi Arabia was said to be replacing any potential shortfall from Iran.

2018-10-08,"WARSAW (Reuters) - The United States will be “very active” at December’s U.N. climate discussions even though Donald Trump pulled out of the global accord, the incoming Polish chairman of the talks said. “The U.S. delegation will appear in Katowice and for sure will be very active, that was confirmed during the talks I had on this subject in Washington,” Michal Kurtyka told Reuters. Kurtyka, a former Polish deputy energy minister, said that although the United States had said it would quit the 2015 Paris Agreement, this would “formally only be possible in 2020”.  While the accord set a sweeping goal of ending the fossil fuel era this century, its text was vague on details. A U.N. report on Monday warned that temperatures are likely to rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2030 and 2052 if global warming continues at its current pace and if the world fails to take rapid and unprecedented measures to stem the increase. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) met last week in Incheon, South Korea to finalize the report, which is seen as the main scientific guide for government policymakers on how to implement the Paris Agreement. This will form a key part of the agenda for environment ministers from almost 200 governments when they meet in Katowice, the heart of Poland’s coal-producing region, Silesia. Kurtyka said that a U.N. meeting in Bangkok in September was a “turning point” when it comes to how the negotiating parties will try to reach a “good result” in Katowice, but a number of sticking points still has to be resolved, including how to finance reducing climate change. A surge in carbon emission prices had influenced the Bangkok talks, Kurtyka said. Carbon prices have more than doubled this year, with utilities ramping up hedging ahead of supply cuts coming into effect from 2019 and as more speculative traders entered the market. “The increase itself is not surprising. What is surprising is the fact that it happened in such a short time. The question is to what extent it reflects the economic fundamentals and to what extend this is a pure market game,” Kurtyka said.  The sudden increase of carbon price is unlikely though to accelerate decisions regarding new low-emission energy projects in Poland, Kurtyka said.  “I assume that a long-term energy policy will be presented by the end of this year, including potential decisions regarding photovoltaic or offshore wind,” he added. Poland generates most of its electricity from carbon-emitting coal, but plans to reduce it to 50 percent of its energy mix by 2040.

2018-10-08,"WARSAW, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Polish oil refiner PKN Orlen expects to receive a first ever shipment of Nigerian crude oil next month, its CEO said, as Poland seeks to reduce its reliance on Russian supplies. State-run PKN Orlen, Poland’s biggest refiner, and smaller rival Lotos, which it is taking over, rely mostly on Russian oil delivered via pipelines built in the 1960s but both have increased purchases from other sources. “Nigeria is our new source of supplies we are exploring. Currently, a batch of 130,000 tonnes of Nigerian oil is on its way to Poland. It is expected to arrive at Naftoport (in Gdansk) in mid-October,” PKN’s Chief Executive Daniel Obajtek told Reuters in an interview last week. “If tests confirm the assumed yields structure and margins, further oil supplies from Nigeria will be a viable option,” he said. PKN Orlen signed a long-term agreement on regular oil supplies with Saudi Aramco in 2016 and since then both PKN and Lotos have also purchased oil from Iran and the United States. Oil supplies from Russia account for around 70 percent of all oil deliveries to PKN, down from around 90 percent in 2015. “There are also tankers sailing to us from other new directions, but at this stage it is too early to talk about it. We are holding discussions on medium- and long-term oil supply contracts with a number of parties, including US partners,” Obajtek also said. Obajtek said that the deteriorating quality of Russian Urals crude was also prompting PKN to diversify its supplies. “Generally, the lower quality may impact contract prices, as it affects our yields,” Obajtek said but declined to comment on whether PKN is negotiating new contract prices. PKN Orlen is taking over Lotos as part of a plan announced in February to improve its negotiating position in oil purchases and to increase investment capacity. Obajtek said that he hoped to obtain clearance from the European Commission by mid-2019. “We are in the pre-notification phase and we are preparing to submit a merger clearance application, with some guidance already in place. We intend to file a draft application by the end of the year, which will formally trigger the process of negotiations with the European Commission,” Obajtek said. “We are not a threat to the European market. We have a market share of around four percent in Europe, while companies like Shell, BP or Total have much bigger market shares. And these companies obtained clearance for various mergers,” he added. PKN plans to buy 32.99 percent of Lotos shares from the state, possibly in the third or fourth quarter of 2019. Then, most likely by the end of 2019, PKN will announce a tender offer for up to 66 percent of Lotos shares. “Of course, the greatest synergy opportunities will come after the consolidation is complete and after we have taken full control of Lotos,” Obajtek said. PKN Orlen has been working on the construction of 1.2 gigawatt (GW) offshore wind farms, at the Baltic Sea. “However, our experience in this area is limited, and we want to avoid costly mistakes. Therefore, we do not rule out cooperation with a partner that would bring the know-how,” Obajtek said. “I would rather not specify whether we are considering a Polish or a foreign partner, but it is worth mentioning that there is no Polish company that could offer much valuable experience in this respect”. Obajtek, a former chief executive of state-run utility Energa, was appointed PKN Orlen CEO in February and says the company is buying a greater share of products from Polish manufacturers. “Being a champion of the economy is a commitment,” Obajtek said, “as we seek to build our business in a way that would strengthen the economy of our country”.

2018-10-08,"* U.N. report to guide governments on meeting Paris targets * Report affirms meeting 1.5C rise target better than 2C * Exceeding 1.5C rise would demand removing CO2 * Global sea level to rise less with a 1.5C hike (Adds IPCC vice chair comments in paragraph 6) By Nina Chestney and Jane Chung LONDON/INCHEON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Society would have to enact “unprecedented” changes to how it consumes energy, travels and builds to meet a lower global warming target or it risks increases in heat waves, flood-causing storms and the chances of drought in some regions as well as the loss of species, a U.N. report said on Monday. Keeping the Earth’s temperature rise to only 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) rather than the 2C target agreed to at the Paris Agreement talks in 2015, would have “clear benefits to people and natural ecosystems,” the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said on Monday in a statement announcing the report’s release. The IPCC report said at the current rate of warming, the world’s temperatures would likely reach 1.5C between 2030 and 2052 after an increase of 1C above pre-industrial levels since the mid-1800s. Keeping the 1.5C target would keep the global sea level rise 0.1 metre (3.9 inches) lower by 2100 than a 2C target, the report states. That could reduce flooding and give the people that inhabit the world’s coasts, islands and river deltas time to adapt to climate change. The lower target would also reduce species loss and extinction and the impact on terrestrial, freshwater and coastal ecosystems, the report said. “There were doubts if we would be able to differentiate impacts set at 1.5C and that came so clearly. Even the scientists were surprised to see how much science was already there and how much they could really differentiate and how great are the benefits of limiting global warming at 1.5 compared to 2,” Thelma Krug, vice-chair of the IPCC, told Reuters in an interview. “And now more than ever we know that every bit of warming matters,” Krug said. The IPCC met last week in Incheon, South Korea to finalise the report, prepared at the request of governments in 2015 to assess the feasibility and importance of limiting global warming to 1.5C. The report is seen as the main scientific guide for government policymakers on how to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement during the Katowice Climate Change Conference in Poland in December. To contain warming at 1.5C, man-made global net carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions would need to fall by about 45 percent by 2030 from 2010 levels and reach “net zero” by mid-century. Any additional emissions would require removing CO2 from the air. The report summary said renewable energy would need to supply 70 percent to 85 percent of electricity by 2050 to stay within a 1.5C limit, compared with about 25 percent now. Using carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, the share of gas-fired power would need to be cut to 8 percent and coal to under 2 percent. There was no mention of oil in this context in the summary. If the average global temperature temporarily exceeded 1.5C, additional carbon removal techniques would be required to return warming to below 1.5C by 2100. But the report said the efficacy of measures, such as planting forests, bioenergy use or capturing and storing CO2, were unproven at a large scale and carried some risks. But the effects of not meeting the 1.5C target would mean huge changes to the world. The lower level would mean the Arctic Ocean would be free of sea ice in summer only once per century not at least once a decade under the higher target. Coral reefs would decline by a still unsustainable 70 percent to 90 percent instead of being virtually wiped out under the higher increase. “The report shows that we only have the slimmest of opportunities remaining to avoid unthinkable damage to the climate system that supports life as we know it,” said Amjad Abdulla, the IPCC board member and chief negotiator for an alliance of small island states at risk of flooding as sea levels rise.

2018-10-08,"MELBOURNE, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Macquarie Group said on Monday it has agreed to help back an ambitious A$22 billion ($16 billion) solar and wind power project in outback Australia that could eventually provide power to Indonesia, as well as big miners and hydrogen projects. The project, called the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, is looking to build 11 gigawatts (GW) of power capacity, with more than half to be allocated to energy users and potential hydrogen producers in northwestern Australia. Macquarie has agreed to provide development capital and take an equity stake in the project, alongside Danish wind turbines giant Vestas and privately owned Intercontinental Energy and CWP Energy Asia, the Asian Renewable Energy Hub said in a statement. A Macquarie spokesman declined to comment on the size of the stake or provide further details of the group’s involvement. “From our perspective, it’s a vote of confidence in the project,” CWP Renewables spokesman Andrew Dickson said of Macquarie’s participation. The project, which has been in the planning stages since 2014, aims to win environmental approval from the state of Western Australia by the end of 2019 and secure financing around 2021. The wind and solar hub would be built in phases over six or seven years. “It really depends on offtakes. We’ve got multiple paths to market,” Dickson said. At 11 GW, the project would be equivalent to nearly 20 percent of Australia’s current total power generation capacity. $1 = 1.4162 Australian dollars

European markets were also set to weaken, with financial spreadbetters expecting the FTSE to open 0.07 percent lower, Frankfurt’s DAX down 0.03 percent, and Paris’ CAC down 0.1 percent. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) on Sunday cut the level of cash that banks must hold as reserves, aimed at lowering financing costs as policymakers worry about fallout from the tariff row with the United States. Reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) - currently 15.5 percent for large commercial lenders and 13.5 percent for smaller banks - will be cut by 100 basis points effective Oct. 15, the PBOC said, matching a similar-sized move in April. Asian shares were also hit on Monday as investors in Chinese stocks reacted for the first time to new pressure from Washington and a report that Chinese spies had compromised U.S. hardware. At 0540 GMT, China’s blue-chip CSI300 index was 3.5 percent lower while the main Shanghai Composite Index was down 2.9 percent. The tech-heavy ChiNext board fell 3.08 percent. The losses in China dragged down MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, which was 0.9 percent lower. James McGlew, executive director of corporate stockbroking at Argonaut Ltd. in Brisbane, said Chinese investors were catching up after global markets turned lower during China’s week-long National Day holiday. “That is exacerbated by the fact that you would have had quite a few long positions going into that time-off and people just quit them and were hitting the bid today,” he said. “We’ve been expecting for some time now the U.S. market to start delivering volatility. We find it quite difficult to reconcile the political machinations that are going on over there being friendly to markets.” On Thursday, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence highlighted disputes with China on issues such as cyber attacks, Taiwan, freedom of the seas and human rights, marking a sharpened U.S. approach toward Beijing beyond the trade war. On Friday, Chinese technology stocks listed in Hong Kong slumped on a Bloomberg report that the systems of multiple U.S. companies had been compromised by malicious computer chips inserted by Chinese spies. On Monday, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was down 0.5 percent and a sub-index tracking information technology firms was 0.9  percent lower. China’s yuan was weaker at 6.8981 per U.S. dollar at 0519 GMT, compared with a previous onshore close of 6.8725 per dollar. Earlier on Monday, the PBOC set the midpoint of the yuan’s daily trading band at 6.8957 per dollar, its weakest level since May 11, 2017. The offshore yuan was also weaker at 6.9050 per dollar. Higher yields on U.S. Treasuries are likely to put more pressure on the yuan as China continues to make use of targeted policy easing to energise the domestic economy. “We expect the PBoC will continue its easing efforts to keep liquidity ample and loosen its credit control to make funds more accessible to the broader economy,” BofA Merrill Lynch analysts said in a note. “Moreover, there is still room for further RRR cuts when necessary, though the chance for an interest rate cut is limited given the continued Fed rate hiking cycle, in our view.” On Monday, the spread between Chinese and U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds was 58.1 basis points according to Eikon data, compared with 150 basis points at the end of 2017. Equity markets around the world came under pressure last week after a steep sell-off in U.S. Treasuries, prompted by hawkish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials and data widely seen as supporting further U.S. rate hikes. Friday’s U.S. non-farm payrolls showed job creation slowed in September, likely from Hurricane Florence’s impact on restaurant and retail payrolls, but the Labor Department report also showed a rise in wages that could keep the Federal Reserve on track for more interest rate hikes. Investors are also keeping an eye on Brazil after right-wing Congressman Jair Bolsonaro won nearly half the votes in Brazil’s first-round presidential election on Sunday, marking a major shift to the right in Latin America’s largest nation fuelled by voters’ anger at corruption.

2018-10-08,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - China’s commodity imports may get a shot in the arm from Beijing’s decision to ease credit conditions in the world’s second-largest economy, but it may not be as big a boost as followed prior monetary loosening. The People’s Bank of China on Sunday announced a steep 100 basis point cut in the level of cash that banks must hold as reserves, matching a similar move in April. The easing of the reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) will inject a net 750 billion yuan ($109 billion) into the banking system, making it easier for banks to extend credit. The loosening of monetary conditions appears to be aimed at shoring up confidence in China’s economy, which has been battered by the escalating trade war with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. There are signs that China’s economy is feeling some pain from the tariff barriers being erected, with equity prices struggling and certain indicators, such as fixed asset investment, trending weaker. In prior years, relaxing credit conditions has resulted in much of the freed-up cash being used for infrastructure and housing construction, thereby boosting demand for raw material such as iron ore, steel and copper as well as thermal and coking coal for energy to process them. There is generally some expectation that the extra cash in the economy will flow through to additional spending on commodity-intensive activity, such as building railways and apartment buildings. But it’s worth noting that April’s lowering of the RRRs didn’t really do much for the level of iron ore imports, which have remained in a narrow band for much of the year, and are down 0.5 percent in the first eight months of the year compared with the same period in 2017. Coal imports have been stronger so far in 2018, but this is more likely a reflection of stronger demand for thermal power generation, as well as robust steel output and production restrictions on the domestic industry. Official trade data for September has yet to be released, but vessel-tracking data compiled by Refinitiv suggests a pullback in seaborne coal imports in the month. China’s seaborne coal imports were 16.3 million tonnes in September, the data showed, down sharply from 19.9 million tonnes in August and the weakest month since February last year. A drop in coal imports may not be too surprising given it’s currently the shoulder season between the summer and winter power demand peaks, and higher prices may also have caused some reluctance among Chinese buyers. Iron ore imports also tracked weaker in September, but not by much, with the Refinitiv data estimating 86.4 million tonnes, down from August’s 87.3 million. Iron ore imports this year have held in a remarkably steady range, according to the vessel-tracking data, with March’s 81.4 million tonnes being the softest and May’s 91.3 million being the strongest. What the data suggests is that China’s demand for iron ore hasn’t been much affected by either the trade dispute with the United States, or by earlier stimulus efforts. Iron ore prices in China were also largely unmoved by the easing of credit, with Dalian Commodity Exchange futures opening slightly stronger after the week-long national day holidays. The front-month contract rose as high as 499.5 yuan ($72.40) a tonne in early trade on Monday, up from a close of 493 yuan on Sept. 28, but by midday it was trading around 494 yuan. This is perhaps recognition that any stimulus will take some time to work its way through the system and if there is any boost to commodity demand, it will take several months to materialise.

2018-10-08,"(Reuters) - Tropical Storm Michael battered parts of Mexico and Cuba with powerful winds and drenching rains on Sunday as it strengthened in the Caribbean on a path that could see it slam into the U.S. Gulf Coast later this week with hurricane force, officials said. The storm was packing maximum sustained winds of 60 miles per hour (95 kph) as it moved north on a path between Cozumel in southeastern Mexico and the western tip of Cuba, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Michael is forecast to become a hurricane on Monday night or Tuesday and approach the U.S. Gulf Coast on Wednesday, making landfall along Florida’s northern Panhandle region, the NHC  said. The storm is then forecast to move northeast along the Atlantic Coast and batter the Carolinas, which are still recovering from Hurricane Florence last month. That hurricane killed at least 50 people and caused billions of dollars in damage. Outer bands from Michael are expected to produce up to 4 inches (10 cm) of rain through Tuesday in the Florida Keys, one of several areas in the state devastated by Hurricane Irma last year. Governor Rick Scott issued an executive order on Sunday declaring a state of emergency in the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend as the state braces for Michael, his office said. He also activated 500 Florida Guard troops ahead of the storm and has a further 5,000 on standby. “As we continue to monitor this storm’s northward path toward Florida, it is critically important that our communities have every available resource to keep everyone safe and prepared,” he said in a statement. In Cuba on Sunday, Michael was expected to dump as much as 12 inches (30 cm) of rain in western parts of the island. “This rainfall could lead to life-threatening flash floods and mudslides in areas of mountainous terrain,” the NHC said. The Commodity Weather Group said on Sunday that some oil rigs in the area may be evacuated as a precaution, which may slow down operations but was not likely to cause much interruption.  The Gulf of Mexico is home to 17 percent of U.S. crude oil and 5 percent of natural gas output daily, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  More than 45 percent of the nation’s refining capacity is located along the U.S. Gulf Coast, which also is home to 51 percent of total U.S. natural gas processing capability.

2018-10-08,"PUERTO PRINCESA, Philippines, Oct 8 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - W hen Theresa Walgraeve and her husband set up their 15-room resort in Puerto Princesa, a city on the Philippine island of Palawan, they worried about mosquitoes and monsoon damp - and the high cost of electricity. That’s when the island’s Zero Carbon Resorts programme approached them with suggestions on how to save energy and costs - from solar panels and LED lights to rainwater harvesting, refillable bottles and bamboo roofs for extra cooling. The Walgraeves enrolled in the programme, made the changes, and achieved significant savings, Theresa Walgraeve said. “They were not very big adjustments, but we were able to cut our electricity and water use by a fair amount,” she said. “Many guests are also mindful and appreciate the fact that we are zero carbon. And we are happy that we make a difference to not just Puerto Princesa and Palawan, but also the Earth.” In 2011, Puerto Princesa became the first Southeast Asian city to earn a “zero carbon” label, meaning it produces no more climate-changing emissions than it can offset, according to an audit by environmental partnership SEED and the Manila Observatory. In fact, by preserving its forests, using “green building” design and shunning the diesel that once powered generators in homes and hotels, the city is “carbon negative” - meaning it pulls more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it emits, according to the audit. That makes it an outlier in the Philippines. But it - like other Philippines cities - has motivation to act: the nation is one of those most severely hit by wild weather triggered by climate change, with its coastal cities particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels and deadly storms. A report by the world’s leading climate scientists, released Monday, gives a stark warning that such threats will continue to grow unless the world can hold hikes in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius - just a half degree higher than today. Around the world, cities are at the frontline of the battle to curb emissions, as urbanisation surges. More than two-thirds of the world’s population is forecast to live in cities by 2050, according to the United Nations. Cities consume also more than two-thirds of the world’s energy and account for about three-quarters of carbon dioxide emissions, according to the UN. “High-growth Southeast Asian cities are very vulnerable, yet lagging behind in incorporating more renewable energy generation in their plans,” said Rob Roggema, a professor and urban sustainability expert at the University of Technology Sydney. “Often, it is the lack of political will that is the reason. But it can be done - no matter how big or small the city - with the participation of residents and the private sector,” he said. Most cities around the world are already dealing with the effects of climate change, from hotter and more humid summers to deadlier storms and frequent flooding. A growing number are taking action. Leaders of some of the biggest cities recently vowed to make all buildings carbon neutral by 2050. More than 70 cities have pledged to become zero carbon by mid-century. Admittedly, Puerto Princesa is a smaller city, with a population of 223,000 people, according to the 2010 census. But Palawan island, with its white-sand beaches and clear blue waters, is seen as a green leader in the country. Twenty-five years ago, the island was being “ravaged” by illegal logging and fishing, and rampant mining, said Edward Hagedorn, who was elected mayor of Puerto Princesa in 1992. Hagedorn - who hailed from a family of loggers - vowed in his victory speech to make the city “clean and green”, and protect its natural resources. In two decades as mayor - after upending term limits - Hagedorn clamped down on commercial logging and mining, and introduced electric tricycles. He also pushed the tourism industry towards more sustainable practices to draw more responsible visitors to its attractions, which include a subterranean river named in 2012 as one of the “new wonders of the world”. That shift has helped replace jobs lost in mining and logging, he said. “I had seen firsthand the destruction caused by rampant logging, fishing and mining,” Hagedorn said. “When I won the election, I had an epiphany: I wanted to show that economic development is possible without destroying the environment. A low carbon pathway is the morally correct one,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. At his urging, Palawan passed a strategic environmental plan in 1992. It declares the state must protect, develop and conserve its natural resources and enhance the environment while pursuing “socio-economic goals”. The Palawan Council for Sustainable Development was set up to oversee this goal. One of its key actions was launching the Zero Carbon Resorts programme in 2011 with funding from the European Union. While member resorts did not receive financial assistance, they could request an audit, and were advised on how to make improvements to increase energy efficiency, said Adelinea Benavente-Villena, who leads the project. Lessons from the experience now have been incorporated into a Zero Carbon and Green Building Policy for Palawan, passed last month. “We are an island eco-system, so we are particularly vulnerable to climate change impact,” Benavente-Villena said. “The measures we introduced in the tourism sector - renewable energy sources, use of local materials and green technologies - are being extended to other sectors, as well.” The push for zero carbon has had mixed results worldwide. While some cities have made significant progress in reducing emissions, there have also been some notable failures. Masdar City in Abu Dhabi, touted as the world’s first emissions-free city, remains behind schedule and sparsely populated. South Korea’s Songdo, billed as the world’s greenest city, also has faced challenges meeting its low-carbon aims. Cities in the Philippines have struggled too. The capital Manila and popular tourist destinations including Cebu are battling choked streets and rising pollution. President Rodrigo Duterte earlier this year called Boracay island, a popular resort, a “cesspool” and ordered its closure for six months, warning of a looming environmental disaster. In contrast, Puerto Princesa’s popularity as a favoured destination for eco-friendly tourism has steadily grown, with more than 850,000 visitors last year compared to 12,000 in 1992, said Frances Victorio, who worked on the greenhouse gas audit in 2009. Today, Puerto Princesa has the largest forest area in the Philippines, at 65 percent, and boasts one of the healthiest coral reefs, said Victorio, a former chief of the Philippine Climate Change Commission. The city “will most probably remain carbon-neutral until at least 2030,” according to the audit, when population growth and vehicle emissions threaten to outpace efforts to cut emissions. Still, “it’s a good example of what can be achieved if people put their heads together and work for a common goal,” Victorio said. “We had good leadership, and everyone was ready to pitch in for the greater good of clean air and clean water for us, our children and our grandchildren.” (Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran.

2018-10-08,"* U.N. report to guide governments on meeting Paris targets * Exceeding 1.5C rise would demand removing CO2 * Global sea level to rise less with a 1.5C hike By Nina Chestney and Jane Chung LONDON/SEOUL, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Temperatures are likely to rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2030 and 2052 if global warming continues at its current pace and if the world fails to take rapid and unprecedented measures to stem the increase, a U.N. report said on Monday. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) met last week in Incheon, South Korea to finalise the report, prepared at the request of governments in 2015 when a global pact to tackle climate change was agreed. The report is seen as the main scientific guide for government policymakers on how to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement. The Paris pact aims to limit global average temperature rise to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels, while seeking to tighten the goal to 1.5C. There has already been a rise of 1C since the mid-1800s as industrialisation lifted emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main greenhouse gas blamed for climate change. A rise of 1.5C would still carry climate-related risks for nature and mankind but the risks would be lower than a rise of 2C, the report summary said. Meeting the 1.5C limit required “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented” change in land and energy use, industry, buildings, transport and cities, it said, adding temperatures would be 1.5C higher between 2030 and 2052 at the current pace. The targets agreed in Paris on cutting emissions would not be enough even if there were larger and more ambitious cuts after 2030, it said. To contain warming at 1.5C, manmade global net carbon dioxide emissions would need to fall by about 45 percent by 2030 from 2010 levels and reach “net zero” by mid-century. Any additional emissions would require removing CO2 from the air. “Limiting warming to 1.5C is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics but doing so would require unprecedented changes,” said Jim Skea, co-chair of the IPCC working group which assesses climate change mitigation. The summary said renewable energy would need to supply 70 to 85 percent of electricity by 2050 to stay within a 1.5C limit, compared with about 25 percent now. Using carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, the share of gas-fired power would need to be cut to 8 percent and coal to between 0 and 2 percent. There was no mention of oil in this context in the summary. If the average global temperature temporarily exceeded 1.5C, additional carbon removal techniques would be required to return warming to below 1.5C by 2100. But the report said the efficacy of measures, such as planting forests, bioenergy use or capturing and storing CO2, were unproven at a large scale and carried some risks. Steps like reflecting incoming solar radiation back into space were not assessed because of the uncertainties about using such technology, the report said. It said keeping the rise in temperature to 1.5C would mean sea levels by 2100 would be 10 cm lower than if the warming was 2C, the likelihood of an Arctic Ocean free of sea ice in summer would be once per century not at least once a decade, and coral reefs would decline by 70-90 percent instead of being virtually wiped out. “The report shows that we only have the slimmest of opportunities remaining to avoid unthinkable damage to the climate system that supports life as we know it,” said Amjad Abdulla, the IPCC board member and chief negotiator for the alliance of small island states.

2018-10-08,"LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a report on Monday saying temperatures were likely to rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2030 and 2052 if global warming continues at its current pace. Below is some background about the IPCC and the report. The IPCC is the world’s leading body for assessing the science related to climate change, its impacts, potential future risks and possible response options. It was established in 1998 by the U.N. Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization to provide policymakers with scientific assessments on climate change. It has 195 member states. The IPCC’s previous report, called the Fifth Assessment Synthesis Report (AR5), was completed at the end of 2014 and called for greenhouse gas emissions to be cut to zero by 2100 to limit the risk of irreversible damage from climate change. Its next major synthesis report, AR6, will be finalised in the first half of 2022. There will also be two more special reports on oceans and land use next year. Monday’s “Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 degrees”, prepared at the request of governments which signed the 2015 Paris Agreement, outlines the impact of global warming of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and steps needed to contain warming at that level. The summary for policymakers presents the main findings of the report, based on an assessment of all available scientific, technical and socio-economic research. It compares the impact of global warming of 1.5C and 2C. The report was prepared by 91 authors and review editors from 40 countries. More than 6,000 scientific references are cited and there were 133 contributing authors. It also contains more than 42,000 expert and government review comments. Writing of the report was led by three working groups - one to assess the physical scientific basis of climate change, the second to look at impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, and the third to assess climate change mitigation. The IPCC met in Incheon, South Korea last week to finalise the report’s findings. Scientists and government representatives reviewed the summary to ensure agreement on the wording. It was approved by the IPCC on Oct. 6. IPCC sessions are conducted behind closed doors. Governments can try and make changes to the text but changes must be agreed by consensus. In addition, IPCC scientists ensure any amendments are consistent with the scientific evidence.

2018-10-08,"SHANGHAI, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Shares in Asia stumbled in early trade on Monday as investors waited with bated breath as China’s markets prepare to reopen following a week-long holiday and after its central bank cut banks’ reserve requirements in a bid to support growth. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.3 percent, after major stock markets around the world fell for a second straight day on Friday. Australian shares were down 1 percent. Markets in Japan are closed for a holiday. Investors will be focused on markets in China, following a decision on Sunday by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) to cut the level of cash that banks must hold as reserves in a bid to lower financing costs and spur growth amid concerns over the economic drag from an escalating trade dispute with the United States. Reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) - currently 15.5 percent for large commercial lenders and 13.5 percent for smaller banks - would be cut by 100 basis points effective Oct. 15, the PBOC said, matching a similar-sized move in April. “It is possible for the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock markets to recover from recent losses if investors can derive optimism based on the change to monetary policy,” Jonathen Chan, a market analyst at CMC Markets and Stockbroking, said in a note. “Expectations of a weaker Chinese yuan may help to lift market sentiment as well,” he said. Following the PBOC’s move, the offshore yuan was 0.2 percent weaker against the dollar in early trade on Monday. Equity markets around the world came under pressure last week after a steep sell-off in U.S. Treasuries, prompted by hawkish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials and data widely seen as bolstering the case of further U.S. rate hikes. “Whether it is just in response to the weight of evidence from the strong US data or instead an active decision by Fed officials to steer the market more towards its tightening profile (the ‘dots’) presented at its rate decision last month, there is little doubt that officials have turned more hawkish recently,” analysts at ANZ said in a note. “The irony in all this is that with the US yield curve steepening meaningfully, that is only likely to embolden the Fed that it can continue to tighten further,” the analysts said. Friday’s U.S. non-farm payrolls showed job creation slowed in September, likely from Hurricane Florence’s impact on restaurant and retail payrolls, but the Labor Department report also showed a rise in wages that could keep the Federal Reserve on track for more interest rate hikes. The 30-year Treasury bond reached a four-year high of 3.424 percent, and was at 3.4054 percent at the U.S. close on Friday. The benchmark 10-year yield was  at 3.3238 percent, while the two-year yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was last at 2.8891 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.68 percent and the S&P 500 lost 0.55 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.16 percent - its first weekly percentage decline since March. In currency markets, the dollar was 0.07 percent stronger against the yen at 113.78, while the euro was 0.05 stronger against the dollar at $1.1528. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was flat at 95.617. U.S. crude dipped 0.48 percent at $73.98 a barrel.

2018-10-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bioenergy from liquid biofuels and biogas will lead growth in renewable energy consumption to 2023, due to its rising use in the heating and transport sectors, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Overall, renewable energy will continue to grow to 2023, accounting for 40 percent of energy consumption growth as countries cut their greenhouse gas emissions to try and keep global warming in check. While growth in solar and wind power is set to continue in the electricity sector, bioenergy will remain the largest source of renewable energy, the IEA said in an annual report on renewables. “Modern bioenergy is the overlooked giant of the renewable energy field,” said Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director. “Its share in the world’s total renewables consumption is about 50 percent today, in other words as much as hydro, wind, solar and all other renewables combined,” he added. So-called modern bioenergy refers to liquid biofuels produced from bagasse-the pulpy residue from sugar cane-and other plants, biogas and other technologies. Traditional bioenergy refers to the burning of biomass such as wood, animal waste and traditional charcoal. The share of renewable technologies meeting global energy demand is expected to increase by a fifth to 12.4 percent in 2023. China will lead global growth in renewable energy due to policies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from all sectors and lessen harmful air pollution and will surpass the European Union as the largest consumer of renewable energy by 2023, the report said. Of the world’s largest energy consumers, Brazil will have the highest share of renewables by far – almost 45 percent of total final energy consumption in 2023, driven by a significant contribution of bioenergy and hydropower. Globally, solar photovoltaic capacity is forecast to expand by almost 600 gigawatts (GW) to 1 terrawatt by 2023 – more than all other renewable energy technologies combined. Wind energy will be the second-largest contributor to renewable capacity growth, growing by 60 percent, but hydropower will remain the largest renewable electricity source by 2023.
