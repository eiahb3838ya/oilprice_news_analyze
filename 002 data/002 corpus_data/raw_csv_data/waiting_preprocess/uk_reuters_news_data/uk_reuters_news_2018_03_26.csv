2018-03-26,"(Adds information about the contract, context on investigation) SAO PAULO, March 26 (Reuters) - Brazil power company Furnas Centrais Elétricas SA, a subsidiary of state-controlled Eletrobras, said on Monday it had signed a $175-mln contract with the construction unit of Odebrecht to expand a power plant in Rio de Janeiro. Odebrecht was one of the main targets in the so-called Car Wash corruption investigation in Brazil that led to the arrest of dozens of politicians and executives, including the company’s then chief executive Marcelo Odebrecht. Its construction unit, Odebrecht Engenharia e Construção (OEC), recently said it was working on its liquidity to avoid a default on bonds after banks raised provisions related to debt held by that unit. The Furnas deal is one of the few contracts that Odebrecht group has been able to sign with state-controlled companies in Brazil since the Car Wash investigation started in 2014. Although many units of Odebrecht were suspended from making deals with the state, OEC is still able to sign contracts with the government. The contract, disclosed by the company and in the official government gazette, is to upgrade the capacity of the Santa Cruz thermal power plant in Rio de Janeiro to 507 megawatts from 350 megawatts.

2018-03-26,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks rose almost everywhere on Monday, reflecting optimism that the United States and China are set to begin negotiations on trade. MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, rose 1.53 percent after touching its level since Feb. 9, stirred by expectations that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would try to reach an agreement with China. Hope of a rapprochement abbreviated the markets’ hangover about a trade war pitting the world’s two largest economies against one another. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 669.4 points, or 2.84 percent, to 24,202.6, the S&P 500 gained 70.29 points, or 2.72 percent, to 2,658.55 and the Nasdaq Composite added 227.88 points, or 3.26 percent, to 7,220.54. Each index turned in its best day of performance since August 2015. The powerful rebound reflected the fact that the market’s bears are not dead so much as back in unseasonably late hibernation. During the day, a weakening U.S. dollar weighed on European stocks, which ended their trading day on weaker footing, while gold gained and oil languished. “The overall health of the world economy is pretty darn good,” said David Haviland, managing partner at Beaumont Financial Partners LLC and its Beaumont Capital Management division. “What I’m concerned about are policy mistakes” by the  Federal Reserve or the Trump administration, he added. “It doesn’t take a lot to tip a market over when it’s this agitated.” Fears of a trade war mounted this month after Trump slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and then on Thursday announced plans for tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods. The Dow sank more than 1,000 points over the two days ended Friday, while the sell-off pushed the S&P 500 to within a hair of its 200-day moving average, a key level watched by market tacticians. Signs of potential compromise were also supported by news that South Korea would be exempt from U.S. steel tariffs in a revision of the bilateral trade pact between the two countries. South Korea’s benchmark share index rose 0.84 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 1.0 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.86 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.72 percent after earlier losses. Haviland said that while trade concerns may seem to have receded, in fact the issue has yet to play out. European policymakers, for instance, remain concerned that more of China’s low-cost steel could be dumped in their markets. European markets were mixed, with concerns over the formation of a new anti-establishment government in Italy weighing on Southern European debt in particular on Monday, though this was counterbalanced to an extent by a ratings upgrade for Spain late on Friday. Italian bonds underperformed, with 10-year yields rising as much as 0.06 percentage point on further signs that the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the anti-migrant League might explore an alliance to form a government. The U.S. dollar weakened 0.43 percent against its peers, foreshadowing a trade war by other means. The greenback’s decline would make U.S. exports cheaper to foreign buyers. But that decline perked up the euro 0.82 percent on a relative basis, hurting the continent’s exporters. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.68 percent. The euro zone’s momentum has been losing pace, according to Citigroup’s economic surprise index for the currency bloc, which is crouched at a two-year low. The CBOE Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge and reflecting S&P 500 price swings anticipated by options traders, dropped 3.75 points to 21.12 during the day but nonetheless remained higher than its peak for all of 2017.

2018-03-26,"(Adds details, comments from biofuel groups) By Jarrett Renshaw WILMINGTON, Del., March 26 (Reuters) - A U.S. bankruptcy judge approved Philadelphia Energy Solutions’ plan for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a Delaware court on Monday, clearing the path for the largest and oldest refinery on the U.S. East Coast to begin its latest recovery. The confirmation in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of Delaware removes the biggest hurdle for the Philadelphia refiner as it seeks to rebound from financial difficulty. PES filed for bankruptcy in January, citing the high cost of complying with the nation’s biofuels obligations. The bankruptcy comes six years after private equity firm Carlyle Group LP and Energy Transfer Partners LP’s Sunoco Inc rescued the refinery from financial distress. The plan provides for $260 million of new capital and sets a new deadline of 2022 for repayment of more than $600 million of debt, along with additional investment from shareholders including Carlyle and the refiner’s management. The plan received unanimous approval from creditors after a number of parties withdrew objections in recent days. The state of Pennsylvania initially opposed the plan, saying PES could owe them an estimated $3.8 billion in unpaid fuel taxes dating to 2015. It withdrew that objection after the parties agreed to language that preserved the state’s ability to collect any unpaid taxes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the refiner had previously agreed to a settlement that allowed it to shed about half of its roughly $467 million in outstanding compliance costs under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The court has to approve this settlement as well, on April 4. The Department of Justice held a 10-day public comment period on the proposed settlement. A number of biofuel comments opposed the plan, arguing it rewards PES for mismanagement and flouting the law. “Although PES attempts to pin blame on the RFS program, it stands alone as the only entity using the bankruptcy court to seek regulatory amnesty from an obligation that affects every refiner equally,” the Renewable Fuel Association wrote the Justice Department. Allen Tenenbaum, representing the U.S. Justice Department, told the judge on Monday that the agency is “keeping an open mind and will consider the comments to make sure the settlement is appropriate.” (Reporting By Jarrett Renshaw Editing by Marguerita Choy and Tom Brown)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-biofuels-pes-bankruptcy/update-1-u-s-judge-approves-philadelphia-refiners-bankruptcy-plan-idUKL1N1R81GV,26 Mar 2018,"A U.S. bankruptcy

2018-03-26,"BUENOS AIRES, March 26 (Reuters) - A year-old labor agreement between companies, workers and the government of Argentina meant to reduce production costs and lure investors to the sprawling Vaca Muerta shale formation is facing resistance, industry sources told Reuters. Vaca Muerta has attracted investment from Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp. But the formation, which is about the size of Belgium, remains mostly unexplored, largely due to high production costs and a lack of labor flexibility, oil major executives have said. The landmark January 2017 labor agreement and a subsidy deal sought to change the dynamic and jumpstart investment, promising government subsidized prices for natural gas, stable taxes and more attractive labor contracts to employers. But it has yet to be fully implemented, and companies may have to offer pay incentives to make it work, undermining its appeal to firms eyeing Vaca Muerta, sources told Reuters. Rising oil prices could help smooth deal-making, sources said, but for now, the labor agreement is failing to live up to expectations. “If you don’t do anything to ensure its terms are applied then obviously the unions are going to refuse to cooperate,” an industry source said on condition of anonymity. The source said that modifications to labor contracts had been successfully applied to unions in hydraulic fracturing, but had yet to reach other areas, like operations and maintenance. Facing pressure from workers, some companies operating in Vaca Muerta have paid bonuses to unions in exchange for signing new, more flexible agreements, meaning “that the cost-savings of the scale initially imagined were never realized,” said Daniel Gerold, director of G&G Energy Consultants, which focuses on oil and gas sectors in Argentina and Latin America. “Some (parts of the agreement) have been implemented, and it is a step forward, but there’s more to be done,” Gerold said. A union representative said workers were holding up their end of the agreement, though some companies had made voluntary payments beyond those agreed upon in last year’s deal. “If there’s a company that pays more than the agreement suggests there’s no reason to question them, that’s their prerogative,” said Guillermo Pereyra, a Senator from the Patagonian province of Neuquen and secretary general of the Oil and Gas Workers Union in producing provinces of Neuquen, Río Negro and Chubut. Sources close to companies operating in Vaca Muerta said many firms still found themselves in continuous negotiations with unions, despite the pact. The important thing is to “apply the agreement as it’s written, and not have to negotiate every detail. Today you still have to negotiate how the (2017 agreement) will be applied,” said an industry source on condition of anonymity. Another industry source said the deal had faced a rocky start but its implementation had improved markedly recently. “With rising global oil prices on the horizon and the gas subsidies (in place) we’re going to see a year of more work and more “fluid” application of the agreement, the source said of expectations that with more jobs in the sector, unions will be more willing to apply the accord. As part of the pact, Argentina offered a subsidized price of $7.50 per million British thermal units of natural gas produced at new wells in 2018, more than double that of front-month natural gas futures NGc1 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The subsidy, offered by the pro-business Macri administration, was seen as a critical element in bringing firms and labor unions together to sign the 2017 agreement.

2018-03-26,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude oil futures slipped on Monday as investors cashed in some profits from last week’s rally but concerns about Saudi-Iran tensions kept losses in check. Brent crude futures LCOc1 slipped 33 cents, or 0.5 percent, to settle at $70.12 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 also lost half a percent, or 33 cents, to end at $65.55. Last week, Brent gained 6.4 percent and WTI rose 5.7 percent, the strongest weekly gains since July.  “I don’t see anything extraordinarily bearish in the market today. I think some folks here are just ... happy to take profits,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York.  Although crude and product futures slipped on Monday, most share prices for energy companies, especially refiners, were up, Yawger said. The S&P Energy Index .SPNY was up more than 1 percent.  Global stocks came off six-week lows on reports that the United States and China would begin trade talks, easing fears of a trade war. Analysts had been concerned that a trade war could hurt oil demand. U.S. President Donald Trump last week signed a memorandum that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of imports from China. “The (oil) market is pulling back after pushing strongly high last week. I think the $70 level in Brent, $67 for WTI ... start to trigger worries of increased U.S. production levels,” said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. The number of active U.S. oil rigs rose to a three-year high of 804 last week, implying further rises in future production. C-OUT-T-EIA “With U.S. crude production likely to be close to 10.5 million barrels per day by now and NGL (natural gas liquids) output also increasing strongly, there is a clear chance that year-on-year supply growth in the U.S. could at least temporarily hit 2 million bpd over the summer months,” JBC analysts wrote. The market found support from rising Middle East tensions.  Saudi air defenses shot down ballistic missiles fired by Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi militia on Sunday, some of which targeted Saudi capital Riyadh. In Asia, Shanghai crude oil futures made a strong debut in terms of volume as investors and commodity merchants bought into the world’s newest financial oil trading instrument. Hedge funds and other money managers raised their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to March 20 after two weeks of cutting bullish bets, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.

2018-03-26,"(Corrects grammatical error in first sentence) By Kate Duguid NEW YORK, March 26 (Reuters) - China’s launch on Monday of its crude futures exchange will improve the clout of the yuan in financial markets and could threaten the international primacy of the dollar, argues a new report by Hayden Briscoe, APAC head of fixed income at UBS Asset Management. “This is the single biggest change in capital markets, maybe of all time,” Briscoe said in a follow-up telephone interview. The launch of the oil futures denominated in China’s renminbi currency, also known as the yuan, is China’s first commodity derivative open to foreign investors. This marked the culmination of a decade-long push by the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) to give the world’s largest energy consumer more power in pricing crude sold to Asia. Already on Monday, Unipec, the trading arm of Asia’s largest refiner Sinopec, has inked a deal with a western oil major to buy Middle East crude priced against the newly-launched Shanghai crude futures contract. This helps cement the exchange’s viability and challenges the petro-dollar system, in which oil deals are executed in dollars. This would decrease demand for the greenback and boost U.S. inflation. China surpassed the United States in 2017 to become the world’s largest oil importer. Nevertheless, the existing price benchmarks - Brent and WTI crude - are both in dollars, and importers across the world must buy dollars in order to conduct oil deals. But the move to trade oil in yuan will diminish the role of the greenback in global financial markets, argues Briscoe. Pricing oil in renminbi and launching a trading hub will raise China’s prominence and integrate it further in global markets. And demand for yuan from foreign investors eager to participate in the Shanghai International Energy Exchange will boost the currency’s value and divert trading away from the dollar. Appetite for dollars would shrink, driving the price of the currency down. The renminbi’s prominence will only grow with China’s consumption: demand will increase 30.6 percent to 753 million tons per year in 2040, according to BP. This power will let China bypass the petro-dollar system and demand that its oil purchases be priced in yuan, as seen in Monday morning’s Unipec deal. This may be even more likely in deals in which China has outsized leverage, such as their offer to buy 5 percent of Saudi Aramco. As it stands, oil exporters store the revenue from their U.S. oil sales in Treasury bonds - a process known as “petro-dollar recycling.” As a result, the rise of the petro-yuan would also jeopardize a key source of financing for U.S. deficit spending.

2018-03-26,"(Adds comment from Stati) ALMATY, March 26 (Reuters) - A court in the United States has ruled in favour of a Moldovan businessman seeking to enforce a $520 million arbitration award against Kazakhstan, a move that may pave way for the freezing of Kazakh assets in the United States. The businessman, Anatolie Stati, has already had a number of court rulings in his favour in Europe in the case, which has led to the freezing of around $28 billion in Kazakh government and sovereign funds’ assets in several European countries. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued its ruling in favour of Stati on March 23, Stati’s press office said in a statement on Monday. The court has also published the judge’s opinion on its website. “With the entry of the U.S. judgment, the Stati Parties will be entitled to enforce that judgment, including by the attachment and seizure of Kazakhstan’s property located in the USA,” Stati’s press office said in an email. “It will be entitled to take these steps even if Kazakhstan appeals the March 23 judgment, unless Kazakhstan posts security for the judgment,” Stati’s press office said. During the enforcement stage of the case, the Stati Parties will be also entitled to compile a full list of Kazakh assets around the world from both Kazakhstan and third parties, the Stati press office said. Stati, his son Gabriel and two family-controlled companies have been involved in legal battles with the Kazakh government of President Nursultan Nazarbayev for several years. They invested in Kazakhstan’s oil and gas industry and have alleged that they were subjected to harassment from the state aimed at forcing them to sell their investments cheaply. They and two of their companies won an arbitration award of around $500 million in Sweden against the government. Kazakhstan denies the allegations, says the arbitration was won through fraud, and has countersued in several countries. Kazakhstan’s central bank, which manages a sovereign fund invested in U.S. securities, did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the court ruling on Monday. (Reporting by Olzhas Auyezov.

2018-03-26,"TIRANA, March 26 (Reuters) - Albania aims to float state-owned electricity distributor OSHEE on the stock market this year, Prime Minister Edi Rama said on Monday. If it goes ahead, it will be the first public offering of shares in a major state-owned company in Albania, but Rama did not say how many shares would be sold or which part of the company would be listed. OSHEE, a state monopoly, is currently being split into three companies: distribution, retail and commercial operations, in line with European Union directives, officials said. “We have started work for an IPO and hope to be ready by the end of the year...,” Rama told a meeting attended by government and EU officials, among others, to outline the Balkan country’s power strategy. “Our ambition is to get the massive participation of citizens as shareholders so both the company and the citizens could benefit,” Rama said. The European Union is a major donor to Albania, which also wants to join the bloc. The Albanian government plans to sell stakes in some other big state companies including oil company Albpetrol but has not set a timeframe. A drain on the state budget for most of the time since Albania dumped communism in 1990, OSHEE cut its group debt to 49.5 billion leke ($473 million) by August 2017, from 67.8 billion leke three years earlier. Artan Gjergji, the head of the Albanian Stock Exchange, said floating shares in OSHEE was likely to stimulate activity on the exchange, and for the first time give Albanians a chance to buy shares, like citizens of other former communist East European countries. Albania aims to liberalise its power sector and open it up to competition by 2025. $1 = 104.7300 leke

But in last-minute talks about the U.S. 2018 budget last week, the U.S. Congress approved a draft Omnibus Spending Bill with a $122 million in-kind contribution for ITER, which President Donald Trump signed into law on Friday, ITER said.  “This is a very positive signal ... it will prevent ITER having to announce project delays in 2018,” ITER Director-General Bernard Bigot told Reuters in a telephone interview.   He added that if the United States would make up for missing cash contributions of about $120 million for the 2016-18 period, ITER would remain on track in future years.  The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project is a cooperation between Europe, the United States, China, India, Japan, Russia and South Korea to build a prototype fusion reactor to generate electricity in a process similar to the nuclear fusion that powers the sun. With an estimated cost of about 20 billion euros ($25 billion), the project is more than halfway towards the first test of its super-heated plasma by 2025 and first full-power fusion by 2035. ITER member countries contributions to the project are not mainly in cash but in kind, as they finance the manufacturing of ITER components via their own national companies. These parts are then shipped to France and assembled on ITER’s Cadarache, southern France site. But there is also a cash contribution, which for the U.S. was 30-32 million euros per year in the 2016 to 2018 period, or about 100 million euros, Bigot said. “We hope that at least maybe a small part of the U.S. 2018 contribution could be in cash so as to give a political signal to the other ITER members,” said Bigot, who was appointed ITER director in 2015. ITER’s main U.S. supplier is California-based General Atomics, which is building the project’s central solenoid, an 18-metre tall pillar-like magnet that will be one of the first components to be installed by 2020. The United States has given about $1 billion to ITER so far, and had been planning to contribute an additional $500 million through 2025.

2018-03-26,"* Report of talks eases concern over potential trade war * MSCI’s World Equity index bounces off six-week low * U.S. stocks rally after Friday’s selloff By Trevor Hunnicutt NEW YORK, March 26 (Reuters) - Stocks in the United States, Japan and emerging markets rose on Monday, reflecting optimism that the United States and China are set to begin negotiations on trade. MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, touched its lowest level since Feb. 9 but was then buoyed to a 0.81 percent gain after a Wall Street Journal report that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was considering a visit to Beijing to begin negotiations. Hope of a rapprochement between the countries abbreviated the markets’ hangover about a trade war pitting the world’s two largest economies against one another. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 302.37 points, or 1.28 percent, to 23,835.57, the S&P 500 gained 25.69 points, or 0.99 percent, to 2,613.95 and the Nasdaq Composite added 70.57 points, or 1.01 percent, to 7,063.23. “This is a time to be adding risk, not reducing it. We are confident purchases at current prices will prove to be a very good entry point for an eventual move to new all time highs this summer,” wrote Morgan Stanley & Co LLC equity strategists including Michael Wilson early on Monday. “Friday’s action does not dissuade us.” The Dow sank more than 1,000 points over the two days ended Friday while the selloff pushed the S&P 500 to within a hair of its 200-day moving average, a key level watched by market tacticians. Emerging market stocks rose 0.69 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.57 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.72 percent to erase earlier losses. Fears of a trade war mounted this month after Trump first slapped tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, and then on Thursday specifically targeted China by announcing plans for tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods. Signs of potential compromise were also supported by news that South Korea would be exempt from U.S. steel tariffs in a revision of the bilateral trade pact between the two countries. South Korea’s benchmark share index rose 0.84 percent. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were little changed, but with yields rising at the front of the curve as the government planned to sell a record high $294 billion of debt this week in a test of investor appetite. In a sign of fear still hovering in the market, yields on longer-dated Treasury debt were falling at the back end of the curve. Spot gold added 0.6 percent to $1,354.65 an ounce at two-month highs. The dollar index fell 0.38 percent. European markets were mixed, with concerns over the formation of a new anti-establishment government in Italy weighing on Southern European debt in particular on Monday, though this was counterbalanced to an extent by a ratings upgrade for Spain late on Friday. Italian bonds underperformed, with 10-year yields rising as much as 0.055 percentage points on further signs that the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the anti-migrant League might explore an alliance to form a government. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.81 percent. But the euro still moved up 0.7 percent to $1.2438. In commodities, international Brent crude futures were last at $69.32, down 0.7 percent on the day. The possibility of a full-blown trade war had weighed on the energy complex on fears that it could harm oil demand. Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt

Sisi inherited an economy in tatters when he took over the presidency in 2014, requiring aggressive reforms that have largely stopped the rot while hurting most Egyptians through a currency devaluation and withdrawal of some price subsidies. “He’s now at the crossroads that every Egyptian president has found himself in,” said Reham Eldesoki, an independent economist long focused on Egypt. “He needs to push forward on intensive reforms, to move forward in building services and non-oil industry and to make Egypt really investment-friendly.” Sisi’s performance in consolidating the gains over the next four years - he is set to cruise to victory in a presidential election which began on Monday - will be watched well beyond Egypt’s borders. European nations particularly worry that any faltering of reforms could worsen unemployment and encourage young Egyptians to cross the Mediterranean illegally, aggravating already sizeable flows of migrants from north Africa. Sisi, who led the military’s overthrow of Egypt’s first democratically-elected president in 2013, was elected president the following year after a prolonged period of popular protests had scared away many investors and foreign tourists. Successive governments’ reluctance to devalue the overpriced currency had led to an acute foreign exchange shortage, dampening imports and pricing Egyptian exports out of foreign markets. Sisi’s signature economic achievement so far has been concluding a three-year deal with the International Monetary Fund in 2016. Under this, the government has raised the price of subsidised fuel to ease the huge burden on the budget, increased value-added tax to 14 percent and devalued the Egyptian pound against the dollar by more than half. Many say the reforms were needed to stablise Egypt as it recovers from the chaos and tackles an Islamist insurgency. However, the currency reform hit the middle classes particularly hard, while inflation remains high, poverty has increased and unemployment is not going down as quickly as people had hoped. Economists see some grounds for hope. GDP growth increased to 5.3 percent year-on-year in the three months to December from a low of 2.1 percent in 2012/13, according to the central bank. “I think we should see growth continuing to escalate,” said Mohamed Abu Basha, an economist with Egyptian investment bank EFG Hermes. “Tourism has space to recover, and consumption and investment should continue to recover over the next few years.” Egypt, once a net energy exporter, had struggled to get enough fuel to run its antiquated power stations, with the country of 97 million people suffering regular blackouts. Under Sisi, the government signed construction contracts for new plants and arranged for floating gas terminals to allow more imports. The power shortages were soon brought to a near halt. Sisi has also acted to break a logjam in gas exploration and development. Likewise, he moved to reduce vast arrears in payments to international energy companies for oil and gas. This has encouraged them to revive their activities in Egypt, leading to several gas discoveries, including the Zohr field, the largest in the Mediterranean region. Zohr, operated by Italy’s ENI, shipped its first gas at the end of 2017. Other fields that were brought on stream included BP’s Atoll and West Nile Delta. The government says the country will be self-sufficient in gas by the end of this year. Sisi launched a series of large infrastructure projects designed partly to put Egyptians back to work. Many won praise, such as new roads and expanded electricity capacity. More controversially, Sisi has begun work on several megaprojects, some of which economists say will produce little immediate return. These include dredging a new branch of the Suez Canal. Sisi insisted the project be completed within a year, adding to the cost, but because of a worldwide trade slowdown canal revenue was little changed. He has begun building several new desert cities, including a $45 billion new administrative capital east of Cairo. Egypt has also been negotiating with Russia for a new $20 billion nuclear power plant. Many investors and economists worry that the army is becoming too involved in these projects and in other ventures, threatening to crowd out private investors. Austerity measures imposed under the IMF deal pushed annual inflation to 33 percent in August. By last month, the rate had dropped back to 14.4 percent. But more planned measures will make it difficult to bring it down further. The government is widely expected to raise fuel prices again at the start of the new fiscal year on July 1. “The challenge now will be to get inflation down to single digits,” Abu Basha said. “We know that they will eliminate most of the fuel subsidies by the end of the IMF programme in 2019.” (Reporting by Patrick Werr; Editing by Samia Nakhoul)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/egypt-election-economy/egypt-economy-stabliises-under-sisi-but-prices-remain-to-be-tamed-idUKL8N1R825X,26 Mar 2018,"Egyptian President Abdel Fattah

2018-03-26,"BRUSSELS/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark is under pressure to rule on whether a new Russian pipeline supplying gas to Germany can be built near its Baltic coast, a decision that puts it in the line of fire from friend and foe alike.   Denmark does not want to act alone in resolving one of the biggest foreign policy quandaries that the small European Union nation has faced since the Cold War. But its search for a united EU stance on the proposed pipeline is deadlocked by divisions among member states over whether to do more business with Moscow despite its military incursions in Ukraine and Syria and accusations it used a nerve agent in an attempted assassination on British soil.  The Danish government is facing fierce lobbying by Russia, EU allies and the United States over the 9.5 billion euro ($11.7 billion) Nord Stream 2 project championed by President Vladimir Putin and financed by five Western firms. “They are under huge pressure from all sides,” one senior EU official said. There is no definite timing for a decision, which had been expected this spring but has been delayed while Denmark considers the security implications. But officials say it cannot be postponed indefinitely.  A Danish veto, under new legislation allowing it to do so on security grounds, would force Russia, which supplies about one third of Europe’s gas needs, to find a new route for the pipeline. “This is not about gas, it is one of the most important foreign policy decisions in Denmark since the Cold War,” said senior foreign policy researcher Hans Mouritzen at the Danish Institute for International Studies.  A delay would weaken Russian gas giant Gazprom’s hand in talks with Ukraine for a new gas transit deal after 2019 and create uncertainty for the firm’s partners: Germany’s Uniper and Wintershall, Anglo-Dutch Shell, Austria’s OMV and France’s Engie. Access to cheap Russian gas to offset declining Dutch production takes priority for nations in northern Europe, particularly Germany, but eastern European countries fear the pipeline will make the EU a hostage to Russian gas. (Graphic: EU imports of Russian gas - tmsnrt.rs/2nz1ySg) In the Nordic states, where Moscow’s military posturing in and around the Baltic Sea has rattled nerves, security is the main concern. The United States has played up these worries in its opposition to Nord Stream 2.  Confidential guidance from Washington, seen by Reuters, for U.S. embassy officials in meetings with EU governments argues that the pipeline could strengthen Russia’s projection of power in the region. Sweden and Finland have yet to issue permits for the 1,225 km (760 mile) pipeline to run under the Baltic Sea through their exclusive economic zone, which is regulated by U.N. law. Germany did so earlier this year. But only in Denmark would the undersea pipe pass through sovereign territorial waters, giving it a greater say. U.S. diplomat Sandra Oudkirk, who visited Copenhagen on her first European tour as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy Diplomacy last week, said Washington does not want Nord Stream 2 built and wants to understand “if the Danish law is a means to that end”.  Danish officials say they are loath to take sides and are unwilling to rush the decision. “In some ways this is too big for Denmark,” one official said. Under the new legislation, Danish diplomats are drafting an opinion on whether foreign and security policy concerns justify blocking 139 km of the pipeline passing through Danish waters. The opinion may take account of objections by EU allies: that the pipeline would undercut EU support for Kiev by depriving it of gas transit fees, increase dependence on Gazprom or concentrate gas supplies along a single route to Germany. Lawmakers gave the government powers to reject the pipeline’s application for a permit last November but had expected support from Brussels, where efforts to reach a consensus have stalled.  Denmark is one of 14 EU states to expel Russian diplomats in response to the nerve agent attack in Britain. It was too early to say whether the attack would be included in the foreign and security assessment of Nord Stream 2, Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen said. If Denmark acts alone to veto the project, that could have unwelcome consequences. “If we are to handle this difficult case alone, Denmark will end up in an unfortunate situation in relation to both Russia and Germany,” said Martin Lidegaard, a senior lawmaker with the Danish Social Liberal Party, which is against the project like the rest of the Danish opposition. With ties between Moscow and Kiev badly strained after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and a pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine, Russia wants to reduce dependence on Ukraine as a gas transit route. Any serious delay to the 55 billion cubic meter a year pipeline could imperil that plan as Gazprom seeks to extend two years of record gas sales to Europe. The Nord Stream 2 consortium says it is carrying out surveys for an alternative route north of the Danish island of Bornholm outside Denmark’s territorial limits. That would cost time and money. “We have to plan for the possibility,” its Financial Officer Paul Corcoran told Reuters. “It will cost more,” he admitted. Pipeline contractor Allseas has said a change of route would add less than 5 percent to total costs. But sources close to the matter doubt it will be as easy to reroute the pipeline as the company says. “The Nord Stream 2 company takes it as a real threat,” said a senior EU source who has seen an estimate of the cost of changing routes. “I was shocked by how high it was,” the source said without disclosing figures. Nord Stream 2 declined to comment on the cost of rerouting, saying it did not wish to “speculate about alternatives and its impacts”.  For now, Denmark is holding off as long as possible on making the decision. “In this case we’re hurrying very slowly,” a government source said.

2018-03-26,"BOGOTA, March 26 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Billions of people live on farmland that is deteriorating and producing less food, and this situation could force hundreds of millions of people to migrate over the next three decades, a major report said on Monday. The study, which is backed by the United Nations, said climate change and worsening land quality could see crop yields halve in some regions by 2050, and warned that larger tracts of degraded land meant conflict over resources was more likely. “Decreasing land productivity also makes societies more vulnerable to social instability – particularly in dryland areas, where years with extremely low rainfall have been associated with an increase of up to 45 percent in violent conflict,” said Robert Scholes, the report’s co-author. The report was written by more than 100 experts from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), a global scientific group. The body said that as degraded land becomes less productive - through deforestation, overgrazing, flash floods or drought - people, many of them poor farmers, are forced to migrate to cities or abroad. And, it warned, when arid, semi-dry or dryland areas degrade further, deserts spread - which means lower crop yields. “In just over three decades from now, an estimated 4 billion people will live in drylands,” Scholes said in a statement. “By then it is likely that land degradation, together with the closely related problems of climate change, will have forced 50-700 million people to migrate,” he said. Increasing demand for food has led to the rapid expansion and unsustainable management of crop and grazing lands, which are key factors in worsening land quality, the report said. It said the problem had reached “critical levels” in many areas, with wetlands particularly badly affected. Land degradation drives climate change, with deforestation - which contributes 10 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions - and soil erosion worsening the problem, it said. “Land degradation, biodiversity loss and climate change are three different faces of the same central challenge: the increasingly dangerous impact of our choices on the health of our natural environment,” said Robert Watson, an atmospheric scientist and chair of IPBES, in a statement. The report said land could be restored by planting trees, using salt-tolerant crops, and re-flooding drained wetlands. More than 550 IPBES experts from more than 100 nations are meeting in Colombia where a set of peer-reviewed regional reports about the state of nature in the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, Africa, Europe and Central Asia have been launched.

2018-03-26,"SINGAPORE, March 26 (Reuters) - A mix of concern and disappointment met Uber Technologies Inc’s deal to sell its Southeast Asian business to bigger regional rival Grab, as drivers and users of the ride-hailing firms took in the prospect of sharply reduced competition. The services throughout Asia have long relied on discounts and promotions for consumers and incentives for drivers, which made for tough competition, pushing down profit margins. Grab said the Uber acquisition accelerated its path to profitability in its core transport business, as it would become the most cost-efficient Southeast Asian platform. While drivers were split on which of the two services offered better compensation, they generally expected fares to go up with the reduced competition. Rennu Mahajan, who has driven a combined three-and-a-half years for both companies in Singapore, said some of her driver friends were concerned because now they would not be able to switch to the other app. “But I am personally not worried. I am quite confident that the fares will go up. If incentives don’t go up, fares will increase and we will still get a little bit more,” said Mahajan, 57. On its Singapore website, Grab said passengers could expect better service with more drivers and transport options available on one app and that fares would not change. For drivers, it said the benefits and incentives structure remained the same. According to mobile data analytics firm App Annie, Grab was ranked fifth among top apps based on monthly active users in Singapore in 2017 versus Uber at No. 7. In Indonesia, Go-Jek was at No. 9 just ahead of Grab. Whether the merger would eliminate competition in Singapore will be the focus of government review, a spokeswoman for the Land Transport Authority said. “We will ensure that no one single market player dominates the sector to the detriment of commuters and drivers,” she said. Malaysia’s Land Transport Authority issued a similar statement, saying it “will work closely with relevant consumer and various regulatory agencies such as the Malaysia Competition Commission to safeguard passengers from unfair terms”. For both Ricky Tan, who has driven for Uber in Singapore for over a year, and Andre Pereira who uses both services, Grab’s ability to exert greater control on prices was cause for concern as it may drive away customers to public transport. “As the only app left, Grab can easily increase prices,” Pereira, 24, said. While there are smaller ride-hailing apps in each market, Grab and Uber have a presence across the region, while Indonesia’s popular Go-Jek only operates within its home country. Drivers in Cambodia, one of the last frontiers in the battle of apps, say competition is fierce and the market will not be easy for Grab. “A lot of people are used to using Uber, Grab isn’t strong yet, Uber is stronger...Grab just arrived,” said Krem Sokhom. The apps have also grown in popularity in countries with fewer public transportation options, such as Vietnam. Le Minh Quan, 30, who drives with both Grab and Uber in Vietnam, said: “Without competition they could enforce higher commission or reduce their support, and that’s worrying. Before we had a choice, but now we don’t.” Banker Le Hoang Ngan also uses both. “Whoever gives me discount codes I’ll go with it, if not, I’ll skip. So one down will just give me less option,” he said. In Thailand, ride-hailing services by privately owned vehicles are illegal but many drivers work with both Uber and Grab. There was no shortage of drivers and riders who liked the service that Grab had to offer. “Grab provides enough promotions for my liking, and even if sometimes they don’t, I don’t mind paying the full price,” said Choltanutkun Tun-atiruj, a magazine writer, who said she preferred Grab’s services and relied on it in her everyday life. “I prefer convenience and what’s the quickest, easiest.” Reporting by Aradhana Aravindan and Dewey Sim in SINGAPORE,

The are two main factors that appear to be emerging that may threaten an end to the current quite rosy picture surrounding demand for commodities such as iron ore, steel and the metals most exposed to the battery boom, cobalt, lithium and nickel. On the supply side, there is a renewed rush of optimism that may set off another round of mining companies over-paying for assets or sinking way too much capital into projects approved on the back of too bullish forecasts. On the demand side, the drums of a U.S.-China trade war are starting to beat a little louder, with Beijing announcing duties on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports on March 23. That came after the Trump administration announced plans for tariffs on $60 billion of Chinese goods, in addition to import taxes on steel and aluminium. While equity markets take the first hit in the opening salvoes of what markets fear may become a full-scale trade war, it is most likely that commodities will suffer longer and harder if the worst does come to pass. Commodities are generally seen as more exposed to the global growth outlook, and a trade conflict will almost certainly result in economic growth being downgraded. This is especially important for commodities, as they also tend to be the top performers when an economic cycle is mature, as is the case with the current global recovery in the decade since the 2008 financial crisis. However, there is still a chance that trade wars remain mainly in the sphere of rhetoric rather than sustained damaging actions. Whether the seeming optimism among major mining companies about the future results in a return to the bad old days of over-investment and poor deals remains to be seen. Certainly, the company bosses seem at their most bullish in recent years, with the world’s biggest miner, BHP, talking up prospects for demand for minerals. Andrew Mackenzie, BHP’s chief executive, told a conference in Switzerland on March 20 that the world may have to spend $3.7 trillion annually to develop and upgrade its infrastructure. “If we look at China’s Belt and Road Initiative, demand for steel is expected to increase by an additional 150 million tonnes over the next decade,” Mackenzie said. These figures were echoed by BHP’s president of iron ore, Edgar Basto, at last week’s Global Iron Ore and Steel Forecast Conference in Perth, in a presentation that went a long way toward justifying the company’s planned $3.6 billion South Flank iron ore project in Western Australia. While the new mine is mainly planned as replacement for depleting existing operations, BHP is far from alone in planning new operations, with rivals Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group also looking at signing off on developments. The industry is still a long way from undertaking the same sort of massive expansion it did in the years from 2010 in the flush of optimism over China’s demand for steel-making ingredients. But there are some similarities emerging, with Chinese demand once again at the forefront. Both Mackenzie and Basto made much of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the government plan to build infrastructure and energy projects across Asia and Africa as part of a new Silk Road promoting trade and development. The problem is that, for now, much of the BRI remains at the vision stage, and very little at the implementation phase. If China was really undertaking vast infrastructure projects across South and Central Asia, as well as in Africa, it would be logical to expect that it was exporting significantly more capital, machinery and semi-finished materials such as steel. Instead, foreign investment fell 2.7 percent in 2017 from the year earlier, and this accelerated in January with a drop of 3.1 percent in the prior 12 months, according to official figures. Steel exports slumped 30.5 percent last year, and were down 27.1 percent in the first two months of 2018 compared to the same period last year. Exports of cement and clinker dropped 27.9 percent in 2017 from the prior year, and while vehicle shipments did jump 43.1 percent last year, this was mainly because of an 83.6 percent surge in car exports, which is most likely not related to BRI spending. BHP, Rio Tinto, Brazil’s Vale and Fortescue all had sunk billions into expanding iron ore capacity, resulting in a collapse of the material’s price. It has since recovered, with Argus Media quoting benchmark 62 percent iron ore delivered to China at $64.15 a tonne on March 23, down from $74 at the end of last year, but still almost double the low of $37.30, hit in December 2015. It took the price slump for BHP and Rio to somewhat reluctantly back away from their long-held forecasts that Chinese steel output would rise to 1 billion tonnes, and the risk is now once again the BRI reality may be somewhat less rosy than the current optimism. More positive for miners looking to enter the battery metals space was the 8 percent increase in China’s exports of storage batteries. But as some mining executives have pointed out, doing deals at the right price in sectors the market sees as hot is challenging. “There’s probably about 5 percent of those opportunities out there that you can really add value with, “ Mark Cutifani, chief executive of Anglo American, told the FT Commodities Global Summit in Switzerland last week. “But in most cases you are going to pay high prices for assets so it’s a hard way to make money,” he added. It’s too early to say that the major miners are about to leap headlong into the old boom-bust cycle of expanding supply to meet overly-bullish forecasts, but the cash generated from the recovery in commodity prices over the past two years may be starting to burn holes in their pockets.

2018-03-26,"SINGAPORE, March 26 (Reuters) - A mix of concern and disappointment met Uber Technologies Inc’s deal to sell its Southeast Asian business to bigger regional rival Grab, as drivers and users of the ride-hailing firms took in the prospect of sharply reduced competition. The services throughout Asia have long relied on discounts and promotions for consumers and incentives for drivers, which made for tough competition, pushing down profit margins. Grab said the Uber acquisition accelerated its path to profitability in its core transport business, as it would become the most cost-efficient Southeast Asian platform. While drivers were split on which of the two services offered better compensation, they generally expected fares to go up with the reduced competition. Rennu Mahajan, who has driven a combined three-and-a-half years for both companies in Singapore, said some of her driver friends were concerned because now they would not be able to switch to the other app. “But I am personally not worried. I am quite confident that the fares will go up. If incentives don’t go up, fares will increase and we will still get a little bit more,” said Mahajan, 57. On its Singapore website, Grab said passengers could expect better service with more drivers and transport options available on one app and that fares would not change. For drivers, it said the benefits and incentives structure remained the same. According to mobile data analytics firm App Annie, Grab was ranked fifth among top apps based on monthly active users in Singapore in 2017 versus Uber at No. 7. In Indonesia, Go-Jek was at No. 9 just ahead of Grab. Whether the merger would eliminate competition in Singapore will be the focus of government review, a spokeswoman for the Land Transport Authority said. “We will ensure that no one single market player dominates the sector to the detriment of commuters and drivers,” she said. Malaysia’s Land Transport Authority issued a similar statement, saying it “will work closely with relevant consumer and various regulatory agencies such as the Malaysia Competition Commission to safeguard passengers from unfair terms”. For both Ricky Tan, who has driven for Uber in Singapore for over a year, and Andre Pereira who uses both services, Grab’s ability to exert greater control on prices was cause for concern as it may drive away customers to public transport. “As the only app left, Grab can easily increase prices,” Pereira, 24, said. While there are smaller ride-hailing apps in each market, Grab and Uber have a presence across the region, while Indonesia’s popular Go-Jek only operates within its home country. Drivers in Cambodia, one of the last frontiers in the battle of apps, say competition is fierce and the market will not be easy for Grab. “A lot of people are used to using Uber, Grab isn’t strong yet, Uber is stronger...Grab just arrived,” said Krem Sokhom. The apps have also grown in popularity in countries with fewer public transportation options, such as Vietnam. Le Minh Quan, 30, who drives with both Grab and Uber in Vietnam, said: “Without competition they could enforce higher commission or reduce their support, and that’s worrying. Before we had a choice, but now we don’t.” Banker Le Hoang Ngan also uses both. “Whoever gives me discount codes I’ll go with it, if not, I’ll skip. So one down will just give me less option,” he said. In Thailand, ride-hailing services by privately owned vehicles are illegal but many drivers work with both Uber and Grab. There was no shortage of drivers and riders who liked the service that Grab had to offer. “Grab provides enough promotions for my liking, and even if sometimes they don’t, I don’t mind paying the full price,” said Choltanutkun Tun-atiruj, a magazine writer, who said she preferred Grab’s services and relied on it in her everyday life. “I prefer convenience and what’s the quickest, easiest.” Reporting by Aradhana Aravindan and Dewey Sim in SINGAPORE,

MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, touched its lowest level since Feb. 9 but was then buoyed to a 0.25 percent gain after a Wall Street Journal report that Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was considering a visit to Beijing to begin negotiations. U.S. stock futures shot up across the board, with Dow Futures up 1.2 percent while S&P futures and Nasdaq futures up 1.3 percent and 1.8 percent respectively. “Exemptions on steel/aluminium tariffs have already been granted for other important trade partners (Canada, Mexico, EU), which suggests the U.S. president is using this approach more for negotiating leverage rather than any real intention to start a global trade war,” wrote Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, noting a “measured” and “nuanced” response from China so far. Most European stock indices also strengthened, with the pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark up nearly half a percent and the export-sensitive German DAX up 0.6 percent. Japan’s Nikkei, meanwhile, erased earlier losses of 1.3 percent to end 0.7 percent higher. Fears of a trade war mounted this month after Trump first slapped tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, and then on Thursday specifically targeted China by announcing plans for tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods. Signs of potential compromises were also supported by news overnight that South Korea would be exempt from U.S. steel tariffs in a revision of the bilateral trade pact between the two countries. South Korea’s benchmark share index rose 0.8 percent. The dollar also bounced off a 16-month low against the Japanese yen but remained close to a one-month low against a basket of currencies, suggesting that fears have not receded completely. Safe-haven government bonds yields, which have been compressed in recent times by worries over a potential trade war, firmed on Tuesday with U.S. Treasury yields rising 2 basis points and euro zone bond yields also edging higher. Concerns over the formation of a new anti-establishment government in Italy weighed on Southern European debt in particular on Monday, though this was counterbalanced to an extent by a ratings upgrade for Spain late on Friday. Italian bonds underperformed, with 10-year yields rising as much as 4 basis points on further signs that the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the anti-migrant League might explore an alliance to form a government. But the euro was still on a positive trajectory, up half a percent to a 2-1/2 week high of $1.2417. In commodities, international Brent crude futures opened above $70 a barrel for the first time since January. In a sign that jitters are still running through the market, spot gold was hovering around five-week highs and was up slightly at $1,348.69 an ounce.

2018-03-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s largest oil trader Vitol said on Monday that its traded crude and products volumes fell slightly in 2017 as it focused on its mid and downstream acquisitions and added assets in the United States by acquiring Noble Group’s oil business.  The total volume was 349 million tonnes, down slightly from 351 million tonnes the previous year, but staying above the 7 million barrel per day (bpd) level hit for the first time in 2016. The trader added that crude continued to represent the bulk of those volumes with a slight rise to 3.6 million bpd while gasoline volumes fell to 34 million tonnes from 44 million tonnes. Separately, the firm increased its traded liquefied natural gas (LNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) volumes. Traded LNG nearly tripled to 7.4 million tonnes per year (mty) up from 2.6 mty in 2016 while LPG volumes fell slightly to 14.3 mty after a strong rise in 2016. Turnover increased on the back of rising oil prices to $181 billion from $152 billion in 2016.  Vitol did not disclose its net profits though the Financial Times said on Sunday they had fallen to $1.5 billion from more than $2 billion in 2016. In its statement, Vitol said “2017 was a challenging year, notwithstanding robust demand growth of 1.6 million barrels a day. Across the year, the pattern of demand and supply surprised the market, causing prices to dip in H1 2017, before rallying in the latter part of the year.”   Independent traders thrive on volatility and the relative steadiness of global oil prices last year eroded already razor-thin margins. Increased global market transparency and data access in recent years have reduced opportunities for arbitrage and exclusivity in certain areas. “Challenging market conditions required a constant focus on careful risk and margin management, though strong demand growth was supportive of volumes and the performance of our investment portfolio,” Vitol’s Chairman Ian Taylor said. Long-time chief executive Taylor handed over the role of CEO to Russell Hardy two weeks ago. Among its mid and downstream investments, Vitol increased its number of retail stations to over 5,000 after buying Turkish chain Petrol Ofisi and bought an 85,000 bpd condensate splitter from Koch Supply and Trading in Rotterdam. About half of these stations will be in Africa after 300 more are added via an agreement with Engen Holdings, which will also spread Vitol’s presence to nine new countries. Vitol also has upstream assets in Ghana that began production with a target of 45,000 bpd.  Looking forward to 2018, Europe-focused downstream subsidiary Varo Energy has announced its intention to float on Euronext Amsterdam while its Africa-focused Vivo Energy is also expected to do an initial public offering this year. The firm is also considering a possible float of its Australian downstream subsidiary Viva Energy, sources familiar with the matter said.

2018-03-26,"WARSAW, March 26 (Reuters) - Poland’s security agents have detained a government official on suspicion of providing Russia with secrets about tactics Warsaw planned to use to try to block the construction of a gas pipeline, the Polish government said on Monday. Stanislaw Zaryn, spokesman for the minister responsible for the secret services, told state broadcaster TVP Info that the man had been detained on Friday, and that a court had approved his detention the following day for up to three months. The official, who has been identified only as Marek W., held a position responsible for energy projects and was providing the Russians with information on how Warsaw intended to block the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, Zaryn said. Poland opposes the construction of Nord Stream 2, which would connect Russia to Germany through a pipeline across the sea and allow Moscow to pump more gas to its main markets in Western Europe while bypassing states further east. Warsaw says the pipeline would strengthen Gazprom’s dominant position on the gas market in central and eastern Europe, limit competition and increase Europe’s dependence on Russian gas. Polish state news agency PAP said the suspect had been in contact with Russian intelligence officers working under diplomatic cover at the Russian embassy in Warsaw. The case comes as Britain and the European Union have clashed with Moscow, accusing Russia of being involved in the poisoning of a former Russian double agent in England. The Russian ambassadors to Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were summoned to the foreign ministries of those countries on Monday, Russian news agencies reported. The Russian ambassador in Poland declined to comment on the reason for the meeting at the Polish foreign ministry.

2018-03-26,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China’s crude futures kicked off to a roaring start on Monday as western traders and Chinese majors eagerly traded the world’s newest financial oil instrument, which many expect to become a third global price benchmark alongside Brent and WTI crude.  Global commodity trader and miner Glencore (GLEN.L), and big merchants Trafigura [TRAFGF.UL], Freepoint Commodities and Mercuria were among the first to trade the new contract, even as concerns remain that smaller overseas investors may struggle with unfamiliar rules and complex regulation.  The launch of the yuan-denominated oil futures <0#ISC:> - China’s first commodity derivative open to foreign investors - marked the culmination of a decade-long push by the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) to give the world’s largest energy consumer more power in pricing crude sold to Asia.  China is the world’s second-largest oil consumer and in 2017 overtook the United States as the biggest importer of crude oil. Its demand is already a key determinant of global oil prices.  With major overseas traders displaying a strong appetite to punt in China’s vast derivatives market, Shanghai’s turnover challenged Brent volumes during Asian hours, reflecting the potential for arbitrage trade with oil markets in the United States, Europe and Oman.  “Whether this will have any real bearing on the other crude benchmarks, I’m not quite sure, but traders love a new toy, so I applaud China for bringing in something that could stoke up some volatility,” said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker with Freight Investor Services (FIS) in Dubai.  First-day enthusiasm saw 20 million barrels of September oil changing hands in Shanghai by the 3:00 p.m. (0700 GMT) close, but it’s not clear the pace will hold in the night session, which runs from 9:00 pm to 2:30 am, or on into coming days.  The 15.4 million barrels done in Shanghai’s 2-1/2-hour morning session initially topped the Brent May crude contract, before Europe’s benchmark came alive around 0500 GMT <0#LCO:>.  “We’ve seen already this morning it appears to be a liquid contract from the off,” said David Martin, JPMorgan Chase & Co’s Asia Pacific head of global clearing, at an event for the launch in Shanghai.  (Graphic: Shanghai crude oil trading kicks off to a roaring start - reut.rs/2I0NieE)     Analysts said western oil traders were attracted to Shanghai’s oil contracts for the potential arbitrage between China’s market specifics and global oil fundamentals as reflected by U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) <0#CL:> and international Brent crude futures <0#LCO:>.  WTI crude is the main benchmark for U.S. crude grades and a crucial hedging tool for the U.S. oil industry. Brent is priced off of North Sea oil and is a primary value marker for Europe, Africa and Middle East crudes. Both futures contracts are commonly used by financial traders.      “Prices assessed at the Shanghai exchange will reflect China’s crude supply and demand,” said Sushant Gupta, research director at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.  Despite the first-day success, the yuan-denominated trading and a blend of new rules and regulatory burdens could in the long-run hamper sustained take-up on the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), executives at a dozen banks and brokers and experts involved in the launch told Reuters.  Still, China offers the potential for a deep, liquid market, buoyed by an explosion of interest from mom-and-pop investors that has supported its vast commodities derivative markets from apples to iron ore in Shanghai, Zhengzhou and Dalian.  The yuan-denominated contract will also help Beijing’s  efforts to internationalize the nation’s currency, said Woodmac’s Gupta.  A surprise to many was that Glencore executed Shanghai’s first crude deal. Swiss-based commodity traders Trafigura and Mercuria, U.S.-based Freepoint, and independent refiner Shandong Wonfull were other early participants. “Glencore’s first bid reflected the high participation and enthusiasm of foreign traders for Chinese crude oil futures,” said Yang Xidong, general manager of Xinhu Futures Co Ltd.  “We were active with Glencore today and I’ve seen Trafigura in it and Freepoint ... We take the view that the contract is viable and adds to the crude oil trading value chain, and is here to stay,” said Kevin Tan, executive vice president at Singapore-based brokerage Straits Financial Services.  Straits said it brokered the first trade for Glencore and cleared the deal through Xinhu Futures. Chinese trader Unipec told Reuters it was the counterparty for the Glencore deal.  The early involvement of big international traders was a morale boost to the fledging market, but state oil majors like PetroChina (601857.SS) and Sinopec (600028.SS) are expected to provide a significant amount of liquidity in the long-term.  Unipec, trading arm of Asia’s largest refiner Sinopec, has inked a deal with a western oil major to buy Middle East crude priced against the Shanghai futures contract, a senior company official said on Monday.  This could be seen as competition to the Dubai Mercantile Exchange’s (DME) crude futures <0#DUBSGEFS:> and potentially the assessments published by price reporting agency S&P Global Platts (SPGI.N).  Speculative retail and institutional investors also propped up the launch-day’s liquidity, said Chen Tong, Shanghai-based senior crude analyst at First Futures.  “In the short-term, we believe price fluctuations will reflect domestic crude oil supply and demand. In the long run, yuan crude price will mirror the moves of Brent,” he said.  The most-active September ISCU8 contract opened at 440.4 yuan ($69.78) per barrel versus a reference point of 416 yuan, jumping as high as 447.1 yuan ($70.85) in the first few minutes.  The jump came after Brent futures for May delivery opened above $70 per barrel for the first time since January on expectations OPEC-leader Saudi Arabia may extend supply cuts into 2019, as well as over concern that the United States may re-introduce sanctions against Iran.  At the end of afternoon session, Shanghai prices were up 3.34 percent at 430.2 yuan, with 40,656 lots traded.  Brent and WTI, in contrast, were down by that time, weighed down by concerns over a looming U.S. trade dispute with China. Chinese exchanges count each side of a trade - the buy and the sell - as two lots, meaning the total oil changing hands was 20,328 lots, equal to 20.3 million barrels.

Hong Kong-based Unipec Asia will buy the crude delivered to China for one year starting from September, said the source who declined to be named due to company policy. He declined to comment on the counterparty and the purchase volume. Several market sources said Shell International Eastern Trading Co, the trading arm of Royal Dutch Shell, was believed to be the seller. Shell declined to comment. The deal will help cement the viability of China’s first crude futures contract, as the world’s largest oil importer hopes to create a benchmark to rival global price markers Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI). “We believe the (Shanghai) contract will have a big impact on oil pricing in Asia,” the Unipec official said. “The timing is good as China has opened up the market for independent refiners to import crude,” the source said. “We hope it will be successful.” Also on Monday, the state refiner launched a Shanghai trading desk dedicated to trading INE crude, with a team of about seven people that is expected to grow, a company official said, without giving further details. The high trading volumes for the Shanghai crude contract on its first day, which challenged those of international benchmark Brent during Asian hours, surprised market participants as western commodity merchants and Chinese oil firms both traded actively. More than 15 million barrels per day of Middle East and Russian crude exported to Asia are currently priced using the Dubai and Oman benchmarks assessed by price reporting agency S&P Global Platts and the Oman crude futures on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME). “The liquidity for Shanghai crude futures will surpass that of DME,” he said, providing an alternative price marker for oil deliveries in China.

The total volume was 349 million tonnes, down slightly from 351 million tonnes the previous year, but staying above the 7 million barrel per day (bpd) level hit for the first time in 2016. The trader added that crude continued to represent the bulk of those volumes with a slight rise to 3.6 million bpd while gasoline volumes fell to 34 million tonnes from 44 million tonnes. Turnover increased on the back of rising oil prices to $181 billion from $152 billion in 2016. Vitol did not disclose its net profits though the Financial Times said on Sunday that they had fallen to $1.5 billion from more than $2 billion in 2016. In its statement, Vitol said “2017 was a challenging year, notwithstanding robust demand growth of 1.6 million barrels a day. Across the year, the pattern of demand and supply surprised the market, causing prices to dip in H1 2017, before rallying in the latter part of the year.” Independent traders thrive off volatility and the relative steadiness of global oil prices last year eroded already razor-thin margins. Increased global market transparency and data access in recent years have reduced opportunities for arbitrage and exclusivity in certain areas. “Challenging market conditions required a constant focus on careful risk and margin management, though strong demand growth was supportive of volumes and the performance of our investment portfolio,” Vitol’s Chairman Ian Taylor said. Long-time chief executive Taylor handed over the role of CEO to Russell Hardy two weeks ago. Among its mid and downstream investments, Vitol increased its number of retail stations to over 5,000 after buying Turkish chain Petrol Ofisi and bought an 85,000 bpd condensate splitter from Koch Supply and Trading in Rotterdam. About half of these stations will be in Africa after 300 more are added via an agreement with Engen Holdings, which will also spread Vitol’s presence to nine new countries. Vitol also has upstream assets in Ghana that began production with a target of 45,000 bod. Looking forward to 2018, Europe-focused downstream subsidiary Varo Energy has announced its intention to float on Euronext Amsterdam while its Africa-focussed Vivo Energy is also expected to do an initial public offering this year. The firm is also considering a possible float of its Australian downstream subsidiary Viva Energy, sources familiar with the matter said.

2018-03-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - The UK North Sea is set to resume a two-decade decline in oil production next year, snapping a brief period of growth since 2015, consultancy Bernstein said in a report on Monday. Production in the North Sea, home to the Brent global crude benchmark, peaked in 1999 at 2.6 million barrels per day (bpd) and had steadily slipped until 2014, when it hit around 800,000 bpd. In the past four years, output has stabilised or even recovered. The halt to the decline stemmed from the start-up of several new fields such as the BP-operated (BP.L) Quad 204 west of the Shetland Islands and Enquest’s (ENQ.L) Kraken field east of them. The revival was due also to improved output from existing fields as operators slowed the natural decline of reservoirs by accelerating drilling around wells, a process known as infill drilling, and ran platforms better, Bernstein said.  (GRAPHIC: UK North Sea oil production - reut.rs/2Gokzn0) Decline rates improved from around 18 percent in 2012 to 8 percent in 2016 and 5 percent in 2017, the report said. Output from fields naturally decreases as they age and their resources dwindle. “The stability and even growth from 2015 to 2018 will prove temporary in nature for this 1 million bpd basin,” the report said. Production from the UK North Sea, considered the world’s first deepwater oil basin, is expected to grow by 4 percent, or roughly 40,000 bpd, in 2018 before declining from 2019 to 2021. Infill drilling sharply accelerated following a drop in rig rates in the wake of the 2014 oil price downturn. In 2016, 54 wells were completed, more than double the number in 2012.  At the same time, the production efficiency of wells and platforms increased to 73 percent in 2016 from 60 percent in 2012, accounting for a 200,000-bpd gain in output over the period, according to Bernstein. The decline in output has had a profound impact on North Sea producers.  Nimble, often privately owned companies such as Siccar Point, Neptune and Chrysaor that specialise in extending the life of ageing fields are gradually replacing large producers such as Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and BP, which were among the first to develop the basin but see less opportunity there today.

2018-03-26,"RIO DE JANEIRO/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Oil and gas companies are gathering in Mexico and Brazil this week for what may be two of their last chances to compete for some of the world’s biggest reserves ahead of elections that could dial back energy reforms in both countries.  An auction of rights to explore and produce oil from shallow waters off Mexico and an onshore and offshore auction round in Brazil are taking place months before presidential elections in Latin America’s top two economies. Leftist contenders have pledged to reverse or slow the flow of private money into the oil industry in both countries. The uncertainty of the elections could spur some companies to win bids to lock in access to new exploration areas. “There is indeed a feeling that these could be the last (auctions) for a while,” an executive for one company registered to bid in both countries said on condition of anonymity. Other firms could hold off competing until they see if elections bring any changes to contracts or terms. Mexico’s leftist firebrand candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who is leading in opinion polls, has said he will review over 90 contracts signed since Mexico passed legislation in 2013 ending the 75-year monopoly of state energy firm Pemex. This month Lopez Obrador plans to ask President Enrique Pena Nieto to cancel two auctions planned for the second half of the year if he wins the July election. Support for Lopez Obrador is pegged at around 29.5 percent compared with 21.2 percent for his nearest rival, according to polls. In Brazil, the most likely leftist contender in the presidential race, Ciro Ferreira Gomes, has warned off potential oil company bidders, saying he would expropriate energy assets bought by private investors if he wins the October election. Gomes, a former governor, is trailing rightist candidate Jair Bolsonaro in polls where former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has vowed to run but is likely to be barred due to a corruption investigation, is not offered as a candidate.    “The companies might now want greater rates of return or they could get to a point where they will not want that level of risk,” said Alfredo Alvarez, head of the North Latin America energy group for consultancy EY in Mexico.  Most oil executives and analysts told Reuters they are not expecting the reforms to be fully reversed in either country. But many see a slower bidding calendar and changes in contract terms as real possibilities. “The speed of the auctions could be slower and even stop, but the reform is protected in the constitution, which requires two-thirds of the Senate and the lower house to change,” Pemex Chief Executive Officer Carlos Trevino said earlier this month in Houston.   (Graphic including blocks on offer in both auctions: tmsnrt.rs/2pzobJo) Brazil’s top-quality geology and history of honouring contracts have outweighed worries about political instability. Bids in Thursday’s round and in a subsequent auction in June for presalt blocks could be so big they may damage the profitability of any awards, consultancy Wood Mackenzie said.  In September, Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) paid a record $678 million for a Brazilian block with partner Petrobras (PETR4.SA) in a concession-based auction. In another sign of strong demand, firms competing in October to buy stakes in the country’s coveted presalt oilfields promised to give the government as much as 80 percent of the oil produced after costs. For Thursday’s auction in Brazil, 21 companies including Chevron (CVX.N), BP (BP.L), Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Statoil STL.OL, and Total (TOTF.PA) have registered to bid in a round where 70 blocks are being offered.   Majors are likely to vie for a handful of blocks in the prolific offshore Campos and Santos basins, with minimum signing bonuses of up to $575.5 million. Some are rumoured to have desirable presalt geology.  In Mexico, 14 firms and 22 consortia composed of majors and medium-size companies qualified to bid in this week’s auction, which will offer 35 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico’s shallow waters. The government expects at least seven to be awarded, the energy minister said. Pemex is likely the round’s dominant player because it owns the infrastructure and has accumulated a vast knowledge of the geology.

2018-03-26,"* China Feb ethanol imports surge ahead of blending mandate * Sorghum imports fall after anti-dumping probe * Brazil soybean imports up 154 pct vs last year (Adds detail) By Hallie Gu and Dominique Patton BEIJING, March 26 (Reuters) - American farmers are getting a boost as China’s oil refiners and traders imported their biggest volume of corn-based ethanol in nearly two years last month, even as fears grew that China would target U.S. soybeans in an escalating trade spate. The data is the strongest sign that Beijing’s mandate to add biofuel into the nation’s fuel by 2020 is reviving demand for foreign ethanol. Imports slowed to a trickle after Beijing increased tariffs in January last year. Independent refiners, often known as teapots, are scooping up imports to blend into their gasoline because the country does not produce enough to meet growing consumption rates. China bought 197,652 cubic metres of ethanol in February, the highest since May 2016, customs data showed on Monday, as the world’s top auto market prepared for a biofuels push. Almost all of the shipments - 189,035 cubic metres - were from the United States, one of the world’s top producers alongside Brazil, according to data from the General Administration of Customs. While the value of the ethanol is small compared with the those of soybeans, it is good news for U.S. farmers in the world’s top corn grower who worry China will retaliate against Washington’s recent aggressive trade moves by curbing soybean imports. Soybeans were the biggest U.S. agricultural export to China last year. China’s sorghum purchases sank by almost a quarter year-on-year after Beijing launched a probe into U.S. imports of the grain in early February. Last week U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans for tariffs on $60 billion of Chinese goods, in addition to import taxes on steel and aluminium. Beijing responded to the steel and aluminium duties by announcing levies on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports, raising fears of a trade war involving the world’s two biggest economies. The February ethanol imports rose 64 percent from 124,823 cubic metres imported in January, the data showed. In February last year, China imported just 9 cubic metres from the U.S. China’s soybean imports from the United States fell 24.4 percent to 3.35 million tonnes from a year earlier, while shipments from Brazil climbed 154 percent to 1.75 million tonnes. China typically buys almost all its beans from the U.S. in February, but Brazil has been grabbing a bigger share of the lucrative Chinese market with competitive prices over the past year.

MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, turned positive on the day, having earlier hit its lowest level since February 9, after a Wall Street Journal report that Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was considering a visit to Beijing to begin negotiations. U.S. stock futures meanwhile rose more than 1 percent on the news. “Exemptions on steel/aluminium tariffs have already been granted for other important trade partners (Canada, Mexico, EU), which suggests the U.S. president is using this approach more for negotiating leverage rather than any real intention to start a global trade war”, wrote Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, noting a “measured” and “nuanced” response from China so far. Most European stock indices opened slightly higher, with the STOXX 600 benchmark up 0.4 percent and the export-sensitive German DAX up 0.5 percent. Japan’s Nikkei meanwhile erased earlier losses of 1.3 percent to end 0.7 percent higher. Fears of a trade war mounted earlier this month after Trump first slapped tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, and then on Thursday specifically targeted China by announcing plans for tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods. Signs of potential compromises were also supported by news overnight that South Korea would be exempted from U.S. steel tariffs in a revision of the bilateral trade pact between the two countries. South Korea’s benchmark share index rose 0.8 percent. The dollar also bounced off a 16-month low against the Japanese yen, but remained close to a one-month low against a basket of currencies, suggesting that fears have not receded completely. 5-STAR HIT Concerns over the formation of a new anti-establishment government in Italy weighed on Southern European debt on Monday, though this was counterbalanced to an extent by a ratings upgrade for Spain late on Friday. Italian bonds underperformed, with 10-year yields rising as much as 4.5 basis points in early trade, on further signs the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the anti-migrant League might explore an alliance to form a government. But the euro was still on a positive trajectory, hitting a 10-day high of $1.2393 at one stage. In commodities, international Brent crude futures opened above $70 per barrel for the first time since January but the gains could not be sustained as the ongoing trade disputes weighed on global markets.

E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 leaped more than 1 percent while Japan’s Nikkei erased earlier losses of 1.3 percent to end 0.7 percent higher. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.4 percent, flipping back to positive territory from a 0.5 percent fall. European shares ticked up on opening, with Germany’s Dax , France’s Cac and Britain’s FTSE all about 0.3 percent higher. The Wall Street Journal reported U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer listed steps that Washington wants China to take in a letter to Liu He, a newly appointed vice premier who oversees China’s economy. Signs of talk between the two economic giants allayed fear of an escalating trade war, sparked after U.S. President Donald Trump moved to slap tariffs on Chinese goods, on top of import duties on steel and aluminium, prompting a defiant response from Beijing. The United States also agreed to exempt South Korea from steel tariffs, imposing instead a quota on steel imports as the two countries renegotiate their trade deal. South Korea’s benchmark share index rose 0.8 percent. “If we do start to hear more favourable news from the U.S. administration and indeed from the Chinese side over the next few trading sessions, then we may see a sharp reversal of the recent moves in the market,” said Nick Twidale, chief operating officer at Rakuten Securities Australia. Still many investors remained cautious given the high level of uncertainty on where any bilateral negotiations may lead. “Protectionism remains a source of volatility and downside risk for equities,” analysts at JPMorgan said in a note. “Asia ex-Japan equity outperformance is in part a function of faster growth and capital inflows - both clearly at risk in a trade war.” In the uncertain global economic climate, investors looked to pile into the Japanese yen, traditionally a safe haven asset thanks to the country’s massive current account surplus. Speculators added short dollar bets to their portfolios, taking the net short position to its highest in more than a year, according to calculations by Reuters and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for the week to March 20. Short yen positions were cut to the smallest since November 2016. By late Asian trade, the yen had eased slightly from near 16-month highs to 105.08 per dollar while the Australian and New Zealand dollars, a liquid proxy for China plays, staged a welcome rebound. The Aussie was up 0.5 percent while the kiwi gained 0.8 percent. The dollar index tracking the greenback against six other major currencies was near a one-month low at 89.423.

Russia supplied 5.052 million tonnes, or 1.32 million barrels per day (bpd) last month, up 17.8 percent from a year earlier, data from the Chinese General Administration of Customs showed. Saudi Arabia regained its No. 2 ranking after losing out to Angola in January, with February supplies coming in at 4.635 million tonnes, or 1.21 million bpd, down 2.9 percent on year but up from 1.01 million bpd in January. The hefty Russian shipments, which gained 21 percent for the January-February period over a year earlier, came after a second East Siberia-Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline started commercial operation in January, along with expanded domestic connections in China. Imports from third-ranking Angola were 973,800 bpd, up 14.7 percent versus a year earlier. Shipments from Brazil recorded the fastest growth among major suppliers, coming in at 2.4 million tonnes or about 626,160 bpd, up 54 percent on year, the data showed. China’s total crude oil imports last month fell sharply from January’s record as independent refineries curbed buying amid worries about new tax rules. The lower imports also came as refineries eased up on buying ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday in mid-February, when manufacturing plants shut for up to two weeks. Imports from the United States were 909,117 tonnes, or 237,020 bpd last month, down from 472,500 bpd in January. U.S. shipments, which benefited from OPEC supply cuts and rebounding crude oil prices, averaged 153,000 bpd last year. State-run Sinopec Corp, Asia’s top refiner, said last month it expected to boost its U.S. crude oil imports this year to more than 10 million tonnes, or 200,000 bpd. Friday’s data also showed China’s imports from Iran fell nearly 28 percent last month on a year earlier to around 474,400 bpd. State-run Chinese buyers have extended annual supply deals for calendar 2018 with Iran, said an industry source with direct knowledge of the matter, with total volumes steady from last year at about 550,000 bpd. Chinese imports of Iranian oil held largely flat last year at around 623,000 bpd. The amount exceeded term volumes as companies lifted cargoes from oilfield investments in the Islamic Republic that are outside the regular supply contracts. tonne = 7.3 barrels for crude oil

2018-03-26,"ZURICH, March 26 (Reuters) - Swiss utility Alpiq has sold building technology businesses for 850 million Swiss francs ($897.19 million) to shore up its finances after announcing on Monday its fifth loss in seven years as low European power prices continue to weigh. Its 2017 full-year loss was 84 million francs, compared with a profit of 294 million francs in 2016, Alpiq said. Since 2011, Alpiq has racked up losses totaling about 4 billion francs, including from writedowns of money-losing hydropower assets whose electricity costs more to produce than the prices it commands from customers. With 2018 expected to remain “challenging”, Chief Executive Jasmin Staiblin sold what had been Alpiq’s growth businesses, InTec and the Krafanlagen Group, to France’s Bouygues Construction. Reuters reported on Nov. 7 that Alpiq was working with Goldman Sachs to find buyers to help cut debt, boost cash and preserve access to capital markets. “This divestment makes Alpiq fit for the future and allows it to focus on its core business, which comprises power production in Switzerland as well as international activities consisting of the flexible, diversified power plant portfolio, the new renewable energies and the strong market presence in energy trading,” Alpiq said in a statement. In a separate statement, Zurich Insurance announced that Staiblin had withdrawn her name from consideration to join its board on the grounds that her attentions were needed elsewhere, including to help keep Alpiq afloat as operating results in the current year are forecast by the company to deteriorate. She does see some bright spots on the horizon, however. A newly introduced market premium will “slightly ease” business for its Swiss hydropower assets, while Alpiq expects international energy trading and European power production to be profitable. “In the medium to long term, Alpiq expects electricity and carbon dioxide wholesale prices to recover slightly, which will reduce the corresponding pressure on the results of Alpiq’s power production in Switzerland,” it said.

2018-03-26," LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - It’s not quite time to run up the red flags, but some recent developments in commodity markets suggest it may be time to start looking for them in the locker. The are two main factors that appear to be emerging that may threaten an end to the current quite rosy picture surrounding demand for commodities such as iron ore, steel and the metals most exposed to the battery boom, cobalt, lithium and nickel. On the supply side, there is a renewed rush of optimism that may set off another round of mining companies over-paying for assets or sinking way too much capital into projects approved on the back of too bullish forecasts. On the demand side, the drums of a U.S.-China trade war are starting to beat a little louder, with Beijing announcing duties on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports on March 23. That came after the Trump administration announced plans for tariffs on $60 billion of Chinese goods, in addition to import taxes on steel and aluminium. While equity markets take the first hit in the opening salvoes of what markets fear may become a full-scale trade war, it is most likely that commodities will suffer longer and harder if the worst does come to pass. Commodities are generally seen as more exposed to the global growth outlook, and a trade conflict will almost certainly result in economic growth being downgraded. This is especially important for commodities, as they also tend to be the top performers when an economic cycle is mature, as is the case with the current global recovery in the decade since the 2008 financial crisis. However, there is still a chance that trade wars remain mainly in the sphere of rhetoric rather than sustained damaging actions. Whether the seeming optimism among major mining companies about the future results in a return to the bad old days of over-investment and poor deals remains to be seen. Certainly, the company bosses seem at their most bullish in recent years, with the world’s biggest miner, BHP, talking up prospects for demand for minerals. Andrew Mackenzie, BHP’s chief executive, told a conference in Switzerland on March 20 that the world may have to spend $3.7 trillion annually to develop and upgrade its infrastructure. “If we look at China’s Belt and Road Initiative, demand for steel is expected to increase by an additional 150 million tonnes over the next decade,” Mackenzie said. These figures were echoed by BHP’s president of iron ore, Edgar Basto, at last week’s Global Iron Ore and Steel Forecast Conference in Perth, in a presentation that went a long way toward justifying the company’s planned $3.6 billion South Flank iron ore project in Western Australia. While the new mine is mainly planned as replacement for depleting existing operations, BHP is far from alone in planning new operations, with rivals Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group also looking at signing off on developments. (GRAPHIC: China's Belt and Road Initiative: tmsnrt.rs/2njAVmw)  The industry is still a long way from undertaking the same sort of massive expansion it did in the years from 2010 in the flush of optimism over China’s demand for steel-making ingredients. But there are some similarities emerging, with Chinese demand once again at the forefront. Both Mackenzie and Basto made much of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the government plan to build infrastructure and energy projects across Asia and Africa as part of a new Silk Road promoting trade and development. The problem is that, for now, much of the BRI remains at the vision stage, and very little at the implementation phase. If China was really undertaking vast infrastructure projects across South and Central Asia, as well as in Africa, it would be logical to expect that it was exporting significantly more capital, machinery and semi-finished materials such as steel. Instead, foreign investment fell 2.7 percent in 2017 from the year earlier, and this accelerated in January with a drop of 3.1 percent in the prior 12 months, according to official figures. Steel exports slumped 30.5 percent last year, and were down 27.1 percent in the first two months of 2018 compared to the same period last year. Exports of cement and clinker dropped 27.9 percent in 2017 from the prior year, and while vehicle shipments did jump 43.1 percent last year, this was mainly because of an 83.6 percent surge in car exports, which is most likely not related to BRI spending. BHP, Rio Tinto, Brazil’s Vale and Fortescue all had sunk billions into expanding iron ore capacity, resulting in a collapse of the material’s price. It has since recovered, with Argus Media quoting benchmark 62 percent iron ore delivered to China at $64.15 a tonne on March 23, down from $74 at the end of last year, but still almost double the low of $37.30, hit in December 2015. It took the price slump for BHP and Rio to somewhat reluctantly back away from their long-held forecasts that Chinese steel output would rise to 1 billion tonnes, and the risk is now once again the BRI reality may be somewhat less rosy than the current optimism. More positive for miners looking to enter the battery metals space was the 8 percent increase in China’s exports of storage batteries. But as some mining executives have pointed out, doing deals at the right price in sectors the market sees as hot is challenging. “There’s probably about 5 percent of those opportunities out there that you can really add value with, “ Mark Cutifani, chief executive of Anglo American, told the FT Commodities Global Summit in Switzerland last week. “But in most cases you are going to pay high prices for assets so it’s a hard way to make money,” he added. It’s too early to say that the major miners are about to leap headlong into the old boom-bust cycle of expanding supply to meet overly-bullish forecasts, but the cash generated from the recovery in commodity prices over the past two years may be starting to burn holes in their pockets.

Global markets were shaken when U.S. President Donald Trump moved to slap tariffs on Chinese goods, on top of import duties on steel and aluminium, prompting a defiant response from Beijing. But E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 brushed off the gloom on Monday to leap 0.6 percent on reports the United States and China have quietly started negotiating to improve U.S. access to Chinese markets. The United States also agreed to exempt South Korea from steel tariffs, imposing instead a quota on steel imports as the two countries renegotiate their trade deal. “If we do start to hear more favourable news from the U.S. administration and indeed from the Chinese side over the next few trading sessions, then we may see a sharp reversal of the recent moves in the market,” said Nick Twidale, chief operating officer at Rakuten Securities Australia. The positive headlines were little consolation for Asian shares which were left nursing their wounds. Japan’s Nikkei trimmed early losses but were still down 0.4 percent. Chinese shares declined about 1.7 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.4 percent for its fourth consecutive day in the red. The index is headed for its first quarterly decline since late 2016 as the risk of faster U.S. rate rises and a trade war spooked investors who had enjoyed a multi-year bull run. South Korea’s benchmark share index rose 0.3 percent, one of only three markets in positive territory. “Protectionism remains a source of volatility and downside risk for equities,” analysts at JPMorgan said in a note. “Asia ex-Japan equity outperformance is in part a function of faster growth and capital inflows - both clearly at risk in a trade war.” In the uncertain global economic climate, investors looked to pile into the Japanese yen, traditionally a safe haven asset thanks to the country’s massive current account surplus. Speculators added short dollar bets to their portfolios, taking the net short position to its highest in more than a year, according to calculations by Reuters and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for the week to March 20. Short yen positions were cut to the smallest since November 2016. By late Asian trade, the yen had eased slightly from near 16-month highs to 104.90 per dollar while the Australian and New Zealand dollars, a liquid proxy for China plays, staged a welcome rebound. The Aussie was up 0.3 percent while the kiwi gained 0.6 percent. The dollar index tracking the greenback against six other major currencies was near a one-month low at 89.423. In commodities, international Brent crude futures opened above $70 per barrel for the first time since January but the gains could not be sustained as the ongoing trade disputes weighed on global markets.

The company, officially known as China Petroleum and Chemical Corp, said net income rose by 10.1 percent year on year to 51.1 billion yuan ($8.10 billion) in 2017, while revenues climbed 22.2 percent to 2.36 trillion yuan as oil prices advanced. Fourth-quarter net profit, however, came in at 12.746 billion yuan, down 26.1 percent year on year, according to Reuters calculations. In a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Sinopec said it had allocated 117 billion yuan of capital expenditure for 2018, up from an actual spend of 99.38 billion yuan last year. That includes a 55 percent hike in upstream spending to 48.5 billion yuan, as China’s biggest refiner looks to make the most of a rally in oil prices since early February to over $70 a barrel. Rival PetroChina  on Thursday said it would also lift spending on exploration and production in 2018, by 3.5 percent, despite a drop in fourth-quarter earnings. Sinopec said some of the funds would go towards building more shale gas production capacity in southwest China, as well as on boosting output from oil projects in the northwest of the country. The company expects to produce 290 million barrels of crude oil in 2018, or approximately 795,000 barrels per day, which is slightly down from 293.7 million barrels in 2017 and would mean Sinopec’s oil output declining for a fourth straight year. It also plans to produce 974.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas, up 6.8 percent from 2017. “We expect the natural gas market to grow rapidly and international oil prices to be stable,” Sinopec said.

The Korean won was also firmer after hitting a near one-month trough on the U.S. dollar last week. U.S. President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on Friday that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of imports from China, although the measures have a 30-day consultation period before they take effect. The tariffs are on top of additional duties on steel and aluminium on a number of countries including China, which has already hit back with its own plans to slap duties on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports. U.S. shares were also clobbered last week, with the Dow falling 1.8 percent on Friday, the S&P 500 declining 2.1 percent and the Nasdaq off 2.4 percent. “A faltering US stock market would be contagious, which it has been since Wednesday,” Capital Economics said in a note. “Stocks in emerging market countries with close to ties to China remain especially vulnerable, as do companies around the world which could be affected by Chinese retaliation,” it added.

2018-03-26,"* Supplies could be disrupted if U.S. re-imposes sanctions on Iran * Saudi Arabia favours extended supply cuts into 2019 * China launches Shanghai crude oil futures By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, March 26 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Monday with international Brent crude futures opening above $70 per barrel for the first time since January. Prices were lifted by expectations that OPEC-leader Saudi Arabia may extend supply cuts into 2019, as well as concerns that the United States may re-introduce sanctions against Iran. In Asia, meanwhile, Monday saw the launch of Shanghai crude oil futures , potentially marking the dawn of a new oil price benchmark to rival dominant Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI). U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $66.06 a barrel at 0157 GMT, up 18 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their previous close. Brent crude futures were at $70.74 per barrel, up 29 cents, or 0.4 percent. “Oil prices are on the ups driven by rising geopolitical risk in the Middle East,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. “President Donald Trump continues to suggest the U.S. will pull out from (the) Iran nuclear deal, which raises the spectre of bringing back sanctions on the country and severely limiting Tehran’s ability to export crude oil,” Innes said. Prices have also been supported by statements from Saudi Arabia, the de-facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), that production cuts that have been in place since 2017 may be extended into 2019. An agreement between OPEC and some other producers, led by Russia, to withhold supplies in order to prop up prices came into force in January 2017, and is currently scheduled for expiry by the end of this year. Financial oil markets have long been dominated by Europe’s Brent and America’s WTI. That may begin to change gradually going forward, as Monday saw the launch of Chinese crude oil futures out of Shanghai - Asia, despite being the world’s biggest and fastest growing oil consumer, has so far not had a benchmark. Few analysts doubt that Asia is overdue a financial oil price benchmark, and that China with its vast consumer and production base is a prime location for it. “The government (in Beijing) seems determined to support it, and I hear a number of firms are being asked or pressured to trade on it, which could help,” said Jeff Brown, President of energy consultancy FGE. Despite this, Brown said there were concerns over regulatory interference, as seen in other Chinese financial commodity markets, including iron ore and coal. “The fact that the government is encouraging the exchange and also is not shy about stepping in to occasionally change the rules may discourage international players,” Brown said.

2018-03-26,"PARIS (Reuters) - Seventy-five percent of French people want President Emmanuel Macron to suspend arms’ exports to countries, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, involved in the Yemeni war, a YouGov poll showed on Monday. Pressure has been mounting on Macron to scale back military support for the two Gulf Arab states over concerns that French weapons are being used in the offensive, which marks its third year on Monday. The two Gulf Arab states are leading a coalition fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi group that controls most of northern Yemen and the capital Sanaa. The conflict has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced more than three million. The poll showed that 88 percent of respondents believed their country should stop arms exports to all countries where there is a risk they could be used against civilian populations and specifically 75 percent for those operating in Yemen. Seven in 10 people said the government should stop exporting weapons to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. “On the occasion of the third anniversary of Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, it is high time for the (French) government to hear this message,” said Eoin Dubsky, campaign manager for the SumOfUs NGO, which commissioned the survey.  “Emmanuel Macron, who presents himself to the world as a humanist president, must pass from words to deeds.” The poll comes as some European states, notably Germany, have curtailed ties with the Saudi-led military coalition. France, Britain and the United States have not followed suit. France is the world’s third-biggest arms exporter and counts Saudi Arabia and the UAE among its biggest purchasers. Unlike many of its allies, French export licensing procedures have no parliamentary checks or balances, making the system particularly opaque. The poll showed that 69 percent of people wanted to see a strengthening of the role of the French parliament in controlling arms sales.   The survey was conducted online between March 20-21 with a sample of 1,026 people from various strands of the French population aged 18 and over.

Japan’s Nikkei stumbled 0.9 percent to a near six-month trough in early trade, due in part to worries over the stronger yen squeezing export earnings. Australian shares declined 0.5 percent to their lowest since early October. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.1 percent for their fourth consecutive day in the red. The index is headed for its first quarterly loss since late 2016 as the risk of faster U.S. rate rises and the spectre of a trade war spooked investors who had enjoyed a multi-year bull run. U.S. President Donald Trump signed a memorandum last week that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of imports from China, although the measures have a 30-day consultation period before they take effect. “Protectionism remains a source of volatility and downside for equities,” analysts at JPMorgan said in a note. “Asia ex-Japan equity outperformance is in part a function of faster growth and capital inflows; both clearly at risk in a trade war.” China urged the United States to “pull back from the brink” as the world’s two largest economies moved closer to a trade war with potentially dire consequences for the global economy. The tariffs are on top of additional duties on steel and aluminium on a number of countries including China, which has already hit back with its own plans to slap duties on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports. “Tariffs on China will very likely cause collateral damage in Asia, particularly to smaller open economies,” said Alex Wolf, Hong Kong-based senior emerging markets economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “A greater share of value-added in U.S. computer imports comes from Asia ex-China than from China itself,” Wolf added. “And the integration of cross-border supply chains means that small open economies like Korea and Taiwan would be highly sensitive to US and/or China trade barriers.” Indeed, the Korean won held near one month lows on the U.S. dollar while South Korea’s benchmark share index was off 0.3 percent after being bitterly hammered on Friday. U.S. shares were also clobbered last week, with the Dow falling 1.8 percent on Friday, the S&P 500 declining 2.1 percent and the Nasdaq off 2.4 percent. Amid the uncertain global economic climate, investors seeking safer assets jumped into government bonds in Europe and the United States. Treasury futures were a shade firmer on Monday while German Bund futures were stronger too. Many investors also turned to the Japanese yen, traditionally a safe haven asset thanks to the country’s massive current account surplus.
