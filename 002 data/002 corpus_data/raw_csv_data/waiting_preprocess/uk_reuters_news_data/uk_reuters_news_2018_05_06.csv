2018-05-06,"NEW DELHI, May 6 (Reuters) - Fraud-hit Indian lender Punjab National Bank (PNB) said on Sunday it aimed to expand its total business 10.8 percent to 12 trillion rupees ($180 billion) in the year to March 2019 and outlined steps to prevent more such frauds. The second-largest state-run bank in February disclosed that two jewellery groups had defrauded it of more than $2 billion by raising credit from overseas branches of other Indian banks using illegal guarantees issued by rogue PNB staff at a Mumbai branch over several years. While investigation continues into what has been called the biggest fraud in India’s banking history, PNB said after a board meeting that it had strengthened the process of underwriting credit to minimise the possibility of fraud. The New Delhi-headquartered bank will split the process of credit underwriting into four divisions with different employees focused on sourcing, appraisal, process and underwriting, documentation and disbursement, and recovery, it said in a statement. The bank will also rely more on an off-site monitoring mechanism and reduce its dependence on physical inspection and audit to identify risks, it added. PNB has constituted a specialised stressed-assets management vertical for early identification of bad loans, the bank said. India’s banks, already burdened by a 9.5 trillion-rupee soured-loan mountain as of last year, are staring at a further rise in bad loans after the central bank tightened rules earlier this year. $1 = 66.8100 Indian rupees

2018-05-06,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Rescue teams have confirmed the death of a second Polish coal miner and are searching for three more trapped nearly a kilometre underground after a quake, the chief executive of the mine owner said.  The quake hit the Borynia-Zofiowka-Jastrzebie coal mine in southern Poland on Saturday morning, initially trapping seven miners at a depth of about 900 metres (2,950 feet). It was the mine’s strongest quake going back to 1989. Two miners were rescued on Saturday after the tremor caused part of the tunnel where they worked to collapse. The energy released by the quake amounted to 40 percent of all energy released in the roughly 110,000 tremors recorded at  the mine since 1989, Daniel Ozon, the chief executive of mine owner JSW, told reporters. Ozon said that the quake had a magnitude of 3.5 to 4.0. Earlier estimates by state mining supervisor WUG put its magnitude at 3.4. The two rescued miners were taken to a hospital in the city of Jastrzebie-Zdroj. They were in “relatively good condition” and could walk unaided, Ozon told reporters on Saturday. About 250 people were working in the mine at the time of the quake, JSW said. The missing miners were from a team of 11 that was drilling a new tunnel. Four escaped by themselves. Rescue operations was hampered by high levels of methane, which reached a concentration of up to 58 percent.  Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who reached the mine on Saturday evening, said the rescue operation was difficult and that he hoped the remaining miners would be saved. President Andrzej Duda reached the mine on Sunday noon. The state mining supervisor said the quake was a type that can occur in coal mines deposits are removed.

2018-05-06,"* Oil prices lift petchems in Saudi * Bahrain’s GFH jumps on Saudi listing news * Drake & Scull up after Tabarak reassures investors * Dubai’s GGICO rallies after month of losses * Vodafone Qatar boosts index By Davide Barbuscia DUBAI, May 6 (Reuters) - Most stock markets in the Gulf posted minor gains on Sunday, reflecting last week’s positive close in international stocks and on the back of firmer oil prices. In Saudi Arabia, the benchmark index edged up 0.1 percent, lifted by gains in the petrochemical sector. Oil prices last week hit their highest in more than three years, with Brent crude oil trading at $74.87 a barrel, as the market awaited news from Washington on possible new U.S. sanctions against Iran. Saudi petrochemical companies such as National Industrialization Company (Tasnee), Saudi Industrial Investment Group and blue-chip Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC), gained 3.1 percent, 3.0 percent and 0.8 percent respectively. Outside of Saudi, Bahraini investment firm GFH Financial Group jumped 10.6 percent after announcing that it had hired Gulf International Bank to help it in its efforts to cross-list on the Saudi stock market. The company also said it planned to raise its assets under management to $30 billion, from a current $6.2 billion, according to its website. An offer to sell all of the company’s real estate portfolio, also announced on Sunday, offered further support to the shares. The Bahraini index rose 1.0 percent, benefiting from GFH’s gains. The Dubai index rose 0.8 percent, lifted by a 4.6 percent gain in contractor Drake & Scull. The shares dropped last week on news that the firm had not got approval to increase its capital through the entry of a new strategic partner. Abu Dhabi investor Tabarak, the largest shareholder in the Dubai-based contractor, reassured investors, saying in a statement last week that it was committed to maintaining its shareholding position in the company and to support it in securing new banking facilities and construction contracts. The best performer in Dubai was Gulf General Investment Co (GGICO), which jumped 12.6 percent. The conglomerate is in talks with lenders to restructure loans and credit lines after defaulting on a debt repayment last year. Last month its shareholders approved a plan to reduce capital to 586 million dirhams ($160 million) from 1.7 billion dirhams. Shares tumbled 9.8 percent when the capital reduction plans were initially announced in early April. After Sunday’s gains, GGICO’s stocks were still 2.7 percent below their value before that announcement. The Abu Dhabi index posted a marginal gain of 0.1 percent, boosted by Arkan Building Materials, which jumped 11.7 percent after reporting a year-on-year increase in first quarter net profit last week, to 11.7 million dirham from 10.6 million dirham. In Qatar, the index rose 1.2 percent as Vodafone Qatar, easily the most traded stock, gained 4 percent after announcing it was preparing to launch 5th generation (5G) services and expected to implement them by the end of the year. * The index edged up 0.1 percent to 8,114 points. * The index gained 0.8 percent to 2,972 points. * The index ticked up 0.1 percent to 4,560 points. * The index went up 1.2 percent to 9,908 points. * The index lost 0.2 percent to 4,784 points. * The index gained 1.0 percent to 1,276 points. * The index shed 0.2 percent to 4,718 points. * The index lost 1.2 percent to 17,611 points. $1 = 3.6730 UAE dirham

2018-05-06,"JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia, May 6 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has held preliminary discussions with foreign firms about manufacturing buses domestically and plans to convert part of its highway system into toll roads to help make its transport system more efficient, the transport minister said. “We are developing the public transport system with a lot of buses, so we want to see how we can leverage this to develop domestic industry,” Nabeel al-Amudi said in an interview on the sidelines of a business conference in Jeddah on Sunday. He declined to name the companies with which Saudi Arabia had been talking. The kingdom, which does not have a significant auto manufacturing industry, is spending billions of dollars to expand public transport systems in the capital Riyadh and other big cities, and has imported thousands of buses in the last few years. Last May, German vehicle maker Daimler received an order from Riyadh for 600 Mercedes-Benz Citaro buses, the largest order for the vehicles in the history of its bus division. China Yuchai International last month announced the delivery of 800 buses to Saudi Arabia. Producing the vehicles locally would allow Saudi Arabia to save on import costs while creating jobs and expanding domestic industry — key goals of an economic reform programme designed to reduce the economy’s dependence on oil exports. Amudi said the potential bus project was separate from a memorandum of understanding signed by Toyota Motor Corp in March last year to conduct a feasibility study on producing vehicles and parts in Saudi Arabia. The reform programme features plans to have the private sector operate much of the kingdom’s transport infrastructure, including airports and sea ports, with the government keeping a role as regulator. Amudi said that approach would be extended to the highway network. The government hopes to establish between four and six toll roads which private companies would operate in exchange for fees, although this may be difficult because of the need to give road users the option of taking a non-toll route in each case, Amudi said. Draft plans for this project may be ready in six months, he added.

The strike targeted a position used by the commanders of the group, south of the town of Deshaisha, the statement said. “The position was completely destroyed,” it said. The Iraqi air force has already carried out several air strikes against IS in Syria since last year, with the approval of the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad and the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State.  Abadi last month said he would “take all necessary measures if they threaten the security of Iraq,” referring to the militants who just three years ago overran a third of Iraq. The prime minister declared final victory over the ultra hardline group in December but it still poses a threat from pockets along the border with Syria and has continued to carry out ambushes, assassinations and bombings across Iraq.

2018-05-06,"(Repeats story from Friday) * Trump likely to drop Iran’s nuclear deal * Rouhani to be sideline as promoter of deal * Iran’s hardliners demand harsh response * The IRC will benefit from sanction By Parisa Hafezi ANKARA, May 4 (Reuters) - Iran’s hardliners are preparing to bring President Hassan Rouhani to heel if U.S. President Donald Trump scraps Tehran’s nuclear deal with major powers, officials and analysts believe. Trump has threatened to abrogate the 2015 agreement by not extending sanctions waivers when they expire on May 12, if Britain, France and Germany do not “fix” its “terrible flaws”. This sets the stage for a resurgence of political infighting within Iran’s complex power structure, Iranian officials said. Annulment of the accord could tip the balance of power in favour of hardliners looking to constrain the relatively moderate Rouhani’s ability to open up to the West. While the spotlight is on Trump’s eventual decision there will be a display of unity in Tehran, a senior Iranian official told Reuters, on condition of anonymity. “But when the crisis is over, hardliners will try to weaken and sideline the president,” the official said. Nor can the president expect any weakening of Iran’s system of clerical rule as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nuclear deal, meaning “Rouhani will be in a no-win situation”, said a relative of Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. For Rouhani the stakes are high. If the deal falls apart, he could become politically vulnerable for promoting the 2015 accord, under which non-nuclear sanctions were lifted in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear programme. “It will also lead to a backlash against the moderates and pro-reformers who backed Rouhani’s detente policy with the West ... and any hope for moderation at home in the near future will fizzle out,” said political analyst Hamid Farahvashian. It is a delicate balance. Khamenei knows that Iranians, many of whom took to the streets earlier this year to protest against high food prices, can only take so much economic pressure. But the establishment does not want too much of an opening to the West, despite the likely economic benefits. A weakened Rouhani, unable to push such policies, is likely to serve out his term, which ends in 2021, another senior official said. “His removal would be a sign of weakness for the system. It would harm its legitimacy abroad,” the official said. “But he will be blamed and pressured for the economic malaise.” Khamenei gave guarded backing to Rouhani when he opened the door to nuclear diplomacy with world powers in order to end Iran’s economic and political isolation. But the Supreme Leader’s aversion to the United States remains a formidable barrier to any diplomatic solution now, so a Trump withdrawal would make it hard for Rouhani to pursue better relations with the West. “The internal politics will make it difficult, if not impossible, for Rouhani to pursue detente with the West and make concessions in return for economic gains,” said another Iranian government official. The European signatories of the deal have tried to persuade Trump not abandon it because they want to keep trading with Iran. Despite threats to walk away if Trump buries the deal, several Iranian officials said that “as long as Tehran was not excluded from the global financial and trading system” it could consider respecting the accord. But many foreign firms are hesitant to invest in Iran, worried by unilateral U.S. sanctions imposed over human rights violations, terrorism, and the dominant role of the Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Iran’s economy. That is another area where Rouhani is exposed. He has sought without much success to curb the economic activities of the IRGC in order to attract foreign investment. But under the command of Khamenei, the IRGC has ignored the government’s attempts to limit its involvement in the economy. If the nuclear deal collapses, what power Rouhani has to limit that involvement will decline further, boosting hardliners who want to see the president’s powers reined in. The IRGC has done well since the sanctions relating to the nuclear deal were lifted, using front companies with no obvious link to the Guard to serve as a conduit for investors returning to Iran. If sanctions are reimposed as a result of the collapse of the nuclear deal, the Guard is well placed to evade them. “Considering their vast business network and political and military influence, the IRGC will be back to the business of evading sanctions as they did for years in the past,” said a western diplomat in Tehran. The IRGC stepped in when European oil companies abandoned energy projects after the United States and the European Union imposed sanctions in 2012. “Sepah (the IRGC) is an asset for Iran. They protect Iran whenever needed ... They rescued the economy when the enemies wanted to crush us with sanctions,” said a hardline politician who declined to be identified. “If European investors yield to America’s pressure and leave Iran, then Sepah will take over,” he said. Concerns over possible Israeli military action against Iran’s nuclear facilities have empowered the IRGC, which runs security at home and abroad. But experts believe that even under the umbrella of an emboldened IRGC, hardliners might hesitate to apply harsh policies, fearing a revival of the anti-government protests in January that showed the establishment was vulnerable to popular anger fuelled by economic hardship.

2018-05-06,"KOTA KINABALU, Malaysia (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak can no longer count on the state of Sabah on the island of Borneo as a “fixed deposit” for his ruling coalition, a senior defector said, just days before the country goes to the polls. Najib has called Sabah, along with neighbouring Sarawak, fixed deposits for consistently voting for his Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, thereby allowing the party to retain power for decades despite losing votes in peninsular Malaysia. But an opposition groundswell in Sabah, famed for its rain forests, beaches, wildlife and mountains, including the country’s highest peak, Mount Kinabalu, threatens to upend expectations of a repeat performance.  Najib is still expected to win Wednesday’s election, aided by recently redrawn electoral boundaries that the opposition and critics say favour his ruling pact and squabbling between the Pakatan Harapan coalition, led by his former mentor, Mahathir Mohamad, and a national Islamist party. The Election Commission and the government have both said the new boundaries are free from political interference.   Shafie Apdal, who leads the opposition push in Sabah, said anger is palpable among Sabah people, who he says have long suffered from poor public infrastructure, porous border security and the lack of job opportunities, despite supporting the ruling coalition for more than 50 years. “It’s shameful for Sabahans to be considered a fixed deposit, when interest is not given (back),” Shafie told Reuters in an interview at his home in the state capital of Kota Kinabalu. “People are no longer stupid.” There are few independent polls that measure voter sentiment in Malaysia, but analysts have mixed views on whether Shafie’s new Parti Warisan Sabah can dent BN’s hold on the state and shift the power balance in parliament.  BN has said it is confident of retaining power in Sabah. Najib says the state now has better infrastructure and that the government has tackled issues like illegal immigration from the neighbouring Philippines and Indonesia. Najib’s coalition faces arguably its toughest election since Malaysia gained independence from Britain in 1957, as former prime minister Mahathir, 92, mounts an unprecedented challenge at the helm of a resurgent federal opposition pact. The prime minister is also grappling with popular anger over rising living costs and allegations of graft, as he seeks to better BN’s performance in the 2013 polls when it lost the popular vote. Shafie, who quit Najib’s United Malay National Organisation (UMNO) party over the prime minister’s handling of the graft scandal at 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), said he had to speak out against his “old friend for 30 years” on a point of principle. Najib denies any wrongdoing. “I’m not a political prostitute that you can dump money in my mouth, in my ears... I was his buddy, now I’m fighting against him,” Shafie said. Since campaigning officially kicked off on April 28, Najib has faced growing criticism from former friends and UMNO veterans. On Saturday, his party sacked two senior leaders and suspended another, all long-time loyalists of Mahathir, for speaking against Najib and attending opposition events. At a campaign stop in Kimanis, a largely agricultural district southwest of the state capital, Shafie told a crowd of about 1,000 supporters that change will only come if people roundly reject BN in both the general election and the state polls, run concurrently.  “The power is in your hands. This is not for Shafie Apdal...  It is not for any other leaders. We do this for the people and future of Sabah,” he said, surrounded by dozens of white flags bearing the party logo of a ship encircled by two clasped hands. BN currently holds 21 of the 25 parliamentary seats. Shafie is promising higher petroleum royalties and greater state autonomy, which are long-standing demands of Sabah people. Sabah, separated from the peninsula by the South China Sea, accounts for nearly a quarter of the country’s vast oil resources.  “The time has come to change Sabah,” Shafie said to cheers from the crowd. “Can we do that?” Editing by Nick Macfie",https://uk.reuters.com/article/malaysia-election-sabah/sabah-no-longer-a-fixed-deposit-in-election-for-malaysias-najib-says-party-rebel-idUKL3N1SC03S,06 May 2018,"Malaysian Prime

2018-05-06,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Rescuers battled in the early hours of Sunday to reach four coal miners who remained trapped nearly one kilometre (0.6 mile) underground in southern Poland after an earthquake. The 3.4 magnitude quake hit the Borynia-Zofiowka-Jastrzebie mine on Saturday morning, initially trapping seven miners at a depth of about 900 metres (2,950 feet), state mining office WUG said. Two had been rescued by mid-afternoon, and one was found late on Saturday but showed no signs of life, the deputy chief executive of the mine owner JSW, Tomasz Sledz, told reporters.  He said the third miner was buried and that it was not yet possible for rescuers to confirm he was dead. He said there had been no contact with the remaining four miners.  The two rescued miners were taken to a hospital in Jastrzebie-Zdroj city in “relatively good condition” and could walk unaided, JSW Chief Executive Daniel Ozon told reporters. “We are doing all we can to save the miners,” Ozon said. There were about 250 people working in the mine at the time of the quake, JSW said. The missing miners were from a team of 11 that was drilling a new tunnel. Four escaped by themselves. The 200-person rescue operation was earlier hampered by high levels of methane, which reached a concentration of up to 58 percent.  A spokeswoman for JSW, the European Union’s largest coking coal producer, said earlier that the quake had damaged communications lines in the area. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who reached the mine on Saturday evening, said the rescue operation was very difficult and that he hoped the remaining miners would be saved. He also visited the two rescued miners at the Jastrzebie-Zdroj hospital. WUG said the quake was of a type that can occur in coal mines after the removal of deposits builds up tensions in the rocks. Polish news agency PAP said family members of the missing miners had gathered at the mine and were being counselled by psychologists.
