2018-07-06,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil was mixed on Friday as a Canadian supply outage supported U.S. crude prices, while an increase in production from OPEC’s biggest exporter Saudi Arabia pushed Brent lower. U.S. crude futures gained 86 cents, or 1.2 percent, to settle at $73.80 a barrel. Global benchmark Brent slipped 28 cents to settle at $77.11 a barrel. For the week, WTI futures lost about 0.5 percent after hitting a 3-1/2-year high on Tuesday, while Brent lost about 3 percent. U.S. crude was bullish after official data on Thursday showed inventories at Cushing, the delivery point for U.S. crude futures, fell to their lowest in 3-1/2 years. That came after an outage at a major Canadian oil sands facility cut regional supply. The outage at the 360,000 barrels per day (bpd) Syncrude facility in Canada has contributed to a sharp reduction in the discount for U.S. crude versus Brent crude over the past month. The discount has halved to $5.54 a barrel on Friday from $11.57 in early June. “We’re continuing to see - and I expect the trend will continue - lower inventories in Cushing in July, resulting in a very tight light sweet crude market,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Associates. “That has been exacerbated by the Canadian Syncrude outage...which has resulted in a scramble for supplies in the Midwest. I do expect that at least over the next few weeks, the Brent-WTI spread is going to narrow.” Brent was being pressured by expectations for higher Saudi and Russia production, which impacts Europe and Asia, where Brent is the benchmark, more than markets dominated by U.S. crude prices. Saudi Arabia told the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that it increased production by almost 500,000 barrels per day last month.  OPEC and its allies agreed earlier this month to a modest increase in output to dampen the oil price rally, which hit a 3-1/2 year high. The supply increase reversed some of the cuts that OPEC and other major producers put in place in early 2017 to end several years of supply glut. Saudi Arabia also said it would reduce the official selling price of its August barrels.  U.S. markets also garnered support from a government employment report showing better-than-expected growth in jobs. That blunted the impact of an escalating U.S.-China trade war. “We’re seeing a bounce to the upside thanks to spillover from a really good jobs number and strength in equity markets, as well as a draw in Cushing stocks,” said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates. The trade war has yet to have a direct impact on oil markets, but China has indicated it could place tariffs on U.S. crude imports. If that happens, “Chinese demand would then shift to other suppliers. Because the oil market is already in tight supply due to the numerous outages, this would drive international prices (Brent) further up,” Commerzbank said in a note.  U.S. producers continued to bring more rigs into oilfields already producing at record levels. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, was up by five in the week to July 6, according to General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm. [RIG/U] That brings the total count to 863, up 100 from last year.

2018-07-06,"(Reuters) - BP Plc is in the lead to acquire the U.S. onshore shale oil and gas assets of BHP Billiton Ltd after submitting an offer worth well in excess of $10 billion (£7.6 billion), people familiar with the matter said on Friday. The move represents a big bet by BP on U.S. oil and gas production at a time when energy prices are rebounding. It would allow it to significantly rebalance its business with oil production, after focusing largely on natural gas assets.  BP is the front-runner in the auction for the assets run by BHP, and could reach a deal in coming weeks, the sources added, cautioning that an agreement is not certain and it is possible that negotiations could end unsuccessfully. The exact terms and composition of BP’s offer could not be learned. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. BP and BHP did not immediately respond to requests for comment. BHP said in August it aimed to sell onshore shale assets in the Eagle Ford, Permian, Haynesville and Fayetteville basins, which it acquired at the height of the oil boom. It had come under pressure from activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp to do so. The acreage for sale includes holdings that BHP acquired in its $12-billion takeover of Petrohawk Energy in 2011, which have declined rapidly in value as the price of natural gas has fallen from $4.50 at the time of the deal to a low of $1.60 last year.  In 2015, BP began operating its onshore U.S. business as a separate entity to make it more competitive. Since then, BP has expanded the business to include acreage in the Haynesville and Bossier shale plays near the Texas–Louisiana border.  However, BP’s expansion in U.S. shale fell behind many of it peers. When others were building out their presence onshore, BP’s focus was on the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil-spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, which has forced it to pay tens of billions of dollars in damages and restitution since 2010. If completed, the acquisition of BHP’s acreage would be transformational for BP’s unit, adding oil-rich wells in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins of Texas. Other oil majors that participated in the auction for the assets include Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron Corp, sources have said.

2018-07-06,"LONDON, July 6 (Reuters) - Asian spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices declined for a third week on producers from Australia to Nigeria boosting spot supply, strong European LNG inventories and Pakistan’s cancellation of a six-cargo tender. Spot prices for August LNG-AS delivery in Asia fell to $10.10 per million British thermal units (Btu), down 20 cents from the previous week, trade sources said. Prices continued reversing from a 20-percent rally last month, driven by large concurrent global production outages and big-ticket tenders seeking more than 40 cargoes for July-September. The market was not fully out of the woods as Malaysia’s giant Bintulu complex may have shut in some production for planned maintenance, traders said. The 30-million-tonne-per-annum, nine-train facility spent last month troubleshooting unexpected electrical faults that impeded output. Angola LNG planned to shut this month ahead of an early August restart. Australia’s Ichthys project, meanwhile, fell further behind schedule, delaying first LNG as developer Inpex patched what it called “minor issues”. On a more positive note, Cheniere Energy’s Corpus Christi project in Texas got the green light this week to introduce gas into the facility, raising the prospect of test LNG exports later this year. The second train from Yamal LNG in Russia’s Arctic should start pumping in September. The fifth train from Cheniere’s Sabine Pass plant in Louisiana starts the following month. A spell of hot weather in Japan led Kansai Electric to buy this week but demand for August and September was still limited there, though Chinese consumption was brisk, in part driven by new government policy mandating that domestic importers boost storage capacity. New rules ask gas suppliers to hold at least 5 percent of imports in storage by 2020, a policy that may be hastening buying demand at Chinese terminals, a trader said. Still, burgeoning supply proved decisive. Nigeria LNG offered three July cargoes as its fifth production unit resumes this month, AP LNG in Australia, Abu Dhabi and Angola had spare July shipments, plus Pakistan’s decision to scrap its tender was also expected to release Egyptian supply into spot markets. In its tender, Pakistan LNG received offers from Vitol and Gunvor in the 15.7-17.1 percent of Brent range, but a sharp downturn in prices subsequently means spot prices are now closer to 13 percent in Brent terms. The prospect of paying such steep premiums as monsoon rains lowered cooling demand led Pakistan to cancel its tender. A promising outlet for Pakistan’s cancelled cargoes could be India where India Oil Corp and Bharat Petroleum have shown demand. In Europe, LNG terminal inventories saw a minor decline in aggregate but remained robust, and in certain markets such as Britain, the Netherlands and parts of France stocks had risen. It suggests further supply availability, for potential reloads, a further bearish factor.

2018-07-06,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil’s state-run oil company Petróleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA)  has lifted restrictions on doing business with certain units of the engineering firm Odebrecht SA [ODBES.UL], Petrobras said in a securities filing on Friday. Petrobras’ board of directors approved the measure at a board meeting on Thursday, the filing said.  Odebrecht has been at the center of a major global corruption investigation, involving numerous other firms that paid billions of dollars in bribes to win contracts with Petrobras in the last two decades.  Under the terms of the agreement with Odebrecht SA, Petrobras will reassess the risk of doing business with its oil and gas unit Ocyan SA before allowing its participation in future Petrobras bids.  Petrobras said construction arm Odebrecht Engenharia e Construção SA will be re-evaluated after it confirms the implementation of specific points of its integrity program. Petrobras said the agreement was possible after Odebrecht  adopted measures to prevent, detect and remediate acts of corruption and fraud, policies Petrobras said it verified. The oil company said it was keeping restrictions on another 14 companies that were put in place in 2014 in the midst of a sprawling bribery and corruption probe.  The investigation, known as “Car Wash,” has been looking into kickbacks in exchange for lucrative government contracts.  Eligibility to return as a Petrobras contractor followed Odebrecht’s leniency agreements with Brazilian and U.S. prosecutors in connection with that probe, the filing said.

2018-07-06,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock markets rose and the euro climbed to a three-week peak on Friday as the threat of tariffs by the United States and China on billions of dollars of trade became a reality, though concerns about the conflict escalating capped the appetite for risk.  MSCI’s measure of world equities markets rose nearly 0.8 percent to the highest level since June 22 while Asian stocks climbed nearly half a percent, led by a rebound in Chinese shares. Stocks edged higher in Europe, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closing 0.2 percent higher.  U.S. equities marched higher after monthly jobs data showing a 213,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in June and stable wage growth.

2018-07-06,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Companies seeking product exclusions from tariffs on Chinese goods imported into the United States will get 90 days to file such requests, until Oct 9, the U.S. Trade Representative’s office said on Friday. Just hours after it activated 25 percent tariffs on some $34 billion (£25.6 billion) worth of Chinese imports, USTR said any exclusions granted would last a year and be retroactive to Friday. “In making its determination on each request, USTR may consider whether a product is available from a source outside of China, whether the additional duties would cause severe economic harm to the requestor or other U.S. interests and whether the particular product is strategically important or related to Chinese industrial programs, including ‘Made in China 2025,’” USTR said.  Once a request is filed and posted on www.regulations.gov, public responses will be collected for 14 days, with an additional seven days for rebuttals. “Because exclusions will be made on a product basis, a particular exclusion will apply to all imports of the product, regardless of whether the importer filed a request,” USTR said. The tariffs were activated on a list of 818 product categories, including cars, computer disk drives, pump and valve parts and light-emitting diodes under the Trump administration’s “Section 301” investigation into China’s intellectual property and technology transfer practices and high-technology industrial subsidy programs.

2018-07-06,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Corn farmers and biofuels producers cheered the resignation of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt in the hope that his successor may give them more access and fewer threats to reducing domestic requirements.  Pruitt led U.S. President Donald Trump’s aggressive efforts to roll back environmental protections. He drew the ire of farmers and antagonized their powerful lobby in Washington when he relaxed enforcement of a mandate to include biofuels such as ethanol - made from grains - in the country’s gasoline and diesel supply. Biofuels are an important source of demand for corn. Pruitt resigned on Thursday after heavy criticism in Congress for ethics-related controversies. His temporary replacement is Deputy Administrator Andrew Wheeler, a former Senate staffer and lobbyist who had done a stint at the EPA earlier in his career. He is a long-time Washington insider with connections to oil, coal and biofuels. Wheeler is best known for his work with coal firms such as Murray Energy. He has also consulted for biofuels association Growth Energy and agricultural merchant and biofuels producer Archer Daniels Midland Co, according to his public financial disclosures. He takes the helm at a time of uncertainty over the agency’s approach to the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a 2005 law that requires greater use of biofuels such as ethanol in the nation’s fuel. Midwest farmers and their representatives say Pruitt weakened the RFS by trying to lower the costs of compliance for oil refiners.  Wheeler may pursue some of the similar goals, biofuels groups say, but they believe he will be more transparent and not “color outside the lines” as they claim Pruitt did. It is unclear exactly what Wheeler’s plans are for the RFS, but during a Senate hearing in November, he said in response to questioning that he respected the program as the “law of the land.” “No one can bank on the outcome, but a fair process is bankable with Andy Wheeler,” Brooke Coleman, head of the Advanced Biofuels Business Council, said on Friday. Wheeler is more of a pragmatist and likely to pay more heed to the way things are typically done in Washington, said Michael McAdams, head of the Advanced Biofuels Association. “The difference is ... Pruitt had an absolute disdain for Washington,” McAdams said. “Pruitt went behind closed doors and took an authoritative position. That’s not how Andy will operate.”  Biofuels groups said Pruitt’s decisions on the mandate were curbing domestic ethanol consumption. Under Pruitt, the EPA issued mass waivers for small refineries from their annual requirements to use biofuels. Ethanol and farm groups have sued the EPA over the refinery exemptions. Ongoing discussions among refiners, farm groups, politicians and officials on changes to the RFS have led to a growing rift between two of Trumps constituencies: the oil and farm lobbies. Trump himself has personally waded into the debate but has been unable to broker a deal that would satisfy both sides. They reached an impasse a month ago when powerful Iowa Republican Senators Grassley and Joni Ernst fought against some of the changes being pushed by Republican Senator Ted Cruz from Texas and oil refiners. In a Tweet on Thursday afternoon Ernst said: “I have confidence that Andrew Wheeler will be a good partner at #EPA, and I look forward to working with him on the #RFS.” The Senate confirmed Wheeler in April with a 53-45 vote, that went mostly along party lines.

2018-07-06,"LONDON (Reuters) - Trading house Trafigura has promoted its two co-heads of risk, Ben Luckock and Robert Gillon, to become co-heads of oil, trading sources said, in a gradual transition of power from veteran oil chief, Jose Larocca. Trafigura has been reshuffling its management in recent months, bolstering the position of Chief Executive Jeremy Weir, while also giving more responsibility to the next generation of potential leaders. Larocca, a Trafigura veteran and among the closest allies of the late founder Claude Dauphin, had previously been the only head of the oil division. Larocca will remain an executive director at Trafigura and will oversee the oil division while helping Luckock and Gillon assume their “leadership responsibilities”, the sources told Reuters. Luckock and Gillon will manage daily activities including all speculative trading, the sources said. Luckock has expressed bullish views on oil prices over the past year.  He was among the first traders to predict a spike in prices last year, saying that the market would see a supply crunch amid soaring global demand and output disruptions around the world. In March, Luckock said that even though U.S. shale output was set to expand at a fast pace, growth was slowing down and was not enough to cover unexpectedly strong global oil consumption.

2018-07-06,"LONDON, July 6 (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them. 1/THE ART OF WAR As U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports kick in, President Donald Trump is threatening to tax goods worth $500 billion — roughly the value of all U.S. imports from China in 2017. What could Beijing do to ease the impact on its economy? In theory, it could ease policy. It has also subtly hinted at using yuan depreciation as a retaliatory tool, by allowing the currency to post its biggest monthly loss on record in June. Though capital outflows are a risk. Upcoming data will provide a crucial insight into China’s economy - the weekend brings the latest FX reserves picture; consumer and factory inflation figures emerge on July 10; trade data due July 13 will show if trade angst had already hit exports and imports in June. All that will set markets up for Q2 GDP due the following week. Tensions with Washington may already have slowed economic growth, Reuters polls predict.

Emerging markets are under the cosh and bond yield curves are flattening - the U.S. yield curve is less than 30 basis points from inversion, the signal that recession is coming. This is the backdrop to a series of speeches next week from some of the world’s most powerful central bankers — Bank of Japan governor Kuroda, European Central Bank chief Draghi, Bank of England boss Carney and Bank of Canada’s Poloz all take the stand. The BoC will likely also raise interest rates next week. Here’s the balance they will try to strike: signal an exit from crisis-era stimulus but not so fast that growth and investor confidence will plummet. It won’t be easy. As it stands, the current economic expansion and bull market are very long in the tooth. Fed tightening alone could be enough to end them both. COLUMN-Solo Fed can puncture global growth all on its own COLUMN-For markets, 2018 mid-point looks more like tipping point Bank of England’s Carney boosts expectations for August rate hike 3/ EARN BABY EARN Amid trade wars signs of slowing economic growth, world markets remain relatively robust. Bumper U.S. company earning are part of the reason. Thanks to tax-cut tailwinds, Q1 earnings growth clocked in at 26.6 percent and the second quarter, starting next week, should moderate only slightly, to 20.7 percent. However, the season is being clouded by trade tensions and their impact on corporate profits. So analysts will closely scrutinise outlook statements to see whether to adjust numbers for the rest of 2018. Right now, 23.4 percent earnings growth is forecast for the third quarter and 20.2 percent for the fourth. U.S. quarterly earnings graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2MrffP3 Financials stocks won big from the tax cuts — their Q1 bottom lines were possibly fattened by as much as $5 billion, many estimate. So eyes will be on Wells Fargo, Citi and JP Morgan reports on July 13. Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S forecast banks’ Q2 growth at 22 percent. But numbers are seen less toppy next year, slimming to 7.3 percent in the first quarter and just over ten percent for the three subsequent. U.S. stock valuations get trickier as trade tensions rise: U.S. tech, banks are big winners from lower taxes in first quarter 4/MAY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY Britain’s markets are in for another bumpy ride next week. They will be digesting the outcome of a crunch Brexit showdown at the government’s country retreat on Friday. Resignations, rebellions and coup plots have all been rumoured if Prime Minister Theresa May doesn’t back a clean break from the EU. At the same time, British industrial giants are sounding shrill warnings of mass exodus if EU trade ties are lost. May will then get a visit from Germany’s Angela Merkel on Tuesday — assuming she hasn’t been ousted by then. Merkel’s visit is part of a Western Balkans summit where, ironically, the main agenda is EU integration. But she will make time for a Brexit powwow with May. And it’s not just politics. On Tuesday Britain publishes monthly growth estimates for the first time, a move intended to give policymakers more timely information about the economy. The numbers will be released alongside output data for the services, industrial and construction sectors, and trade figures.

Those in turn have led Iran’s Revolutionary Guards to threaten a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz, the world’s most important oil artery through which a fifth of the world’s oil consumption passes. Tensions are running high, with the U.S. Navy standing ready to ensure free navigation through the channel. High oil prices are wiping out any benefits the U.S. economy might enjoy from Trump’s tax cuts. But while he has lashed out at the cartel and urged it to raise production, he is also pressuring governments to stop Iranian purchases. Such rhetoric may push oil prices higher still. As will any outbreak of hostilities in Hormuz.

2018-07-06,"(Adds quote, background) KIEV, July 6 (Reuters) - Ukraine’s oil and gas firm Naftogaz said on Friday it had submitted a claim to the Stockholm arbitration court for more than $11 billion from Russian gas giant Gazprom related to a transit contract. The move ramps up a long-running legal dispute between the two countries that has run alongside Ukraine’s broader political stand-off with Russia. Naftogaz said that due to changes in the European gas market it had sought in March to renegotiate the tariff it receives from Gazprom for transit of gas to Europe across Ukrainian territory. “Gazprom has not been constructive in the negotiations, compelling Naftogaz to refer the matter to arbitration as provided for in the contract,” Naftogaz said in a statement. It gave a preliminarily estimate of the value of the claim at $11.6 billion. In February, the Stockholm court ordered Gazprom to pay more than $2.5 billion to Naftogaz over a different contractual dispute. The decision was meant to conclude a long legal battle, but Naftogaz says Gazprom has not complied with the ruling. Ukraine and Russia have had a complex dispute over gas issues for years, which blew up when the two countries became enemies after a pro-Russian leader of Ukraine was toppled in 2014. Last year, Gazprom supplied a record high 194 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas to Europe, excluding former Soviet states and Turkey. Transit of Russian gas via Ukraine jumped by almost 14 percent to 93.5 bcm.

2018-07-06,"(Corrects capacity of refinery to 650,000 barrels per day from 650,000 tonnes in paragraph 7) By Chijioke Ohuocha and Didi Akinyelure LAGOS, July 6 (Reuters) - An oil refinery being built by Aliko Dangote will account for half of his conglomerate’s assets when it is finished next year, a senior executive told Reuters, underscoring the scale of the bet being made by Africa’s richest man on Nigerian oil and gas. Dangote has built his fortune on cement, although his sprawling business empire also spans flour milling, agriculture and real estate. Now he is building the world’s largest single oil refinery and also expanding into fertiliser, aiming to address long-standing problems in Nigeria’s energy markets. Though Africa’s biggest crude oil producer, Nigeria imports almost all of its gasoline due to poor maintenance of its four state-owned refineries. Dangote hopes to meet the fuel needs of Africa’s most populous nation, where poor power supply forces families and businesses to rely on diesel-powered generators. Dangote Group Executive Director Devakumar Edwin said the $10 billion refinery should be completed by December 2019. “As of today, cement is the biggest (part of the group). By 2020, the refinery will be the biggest (by assets),” he told Reuters in an interview at the site in the Lekki district of southwestern Lagos state. Dangote Cement, Nigeria’s biggest listed company, has attracted investment from Dubai and South African sovereign funds. It posted a 2017 profit of 289.6 billion naira ($920.8 million), up 60 percent on 2016, and is valued at $4 billion. Edwin said the oil refinery, with a capacity of 650,000 barrels per day, would also target export markets. “Our primary focus is Nigeria, to meet the entire local demand, but we have the capacity to export more than 50 percent of what we produce, so the secondary focus will be on western Africa and central Africa,” he said. Edwin said the company had held talks with firms including Vitol and Shell over the supply of crude and lifting of petroleum products for sale abroad. The Dangote refinery will be able to process different grades of crude including shale oil. The company is borrowing $3.3 billion for the project, arranged by Standard Chartered Bank. The remainder will be funded by equity and through export agencies, Edwin said. Dangote has also acquired two oil fields in Nigeria from Shell to help supply the refinery. Edwin said the first phase of the 1.5 million tonne capacity fertiliser plant, on the same Lagos state site, would be completed in September and start operating in December. The second line, also 1.5 million tonnes, will start four months later, he added. The refinery and petrochemical complex located on 25,000 hectares of swampy land includes a jetty to ferry products by sea within Nigeria and abroad and an undersea pipeline to transport gas. Dangote will consider listing the oil refinery once it comes onstream, Edwin added. He said that would follow a planned listing of the cement company in London next year after elections in Nigeria. That listing has been mooted for a number of years. Plans have been delayed to enable the company to meet requirements for the listing, which Edwin said had been completed. He said the listing could help it fund acquisitions overseas. $1 = 314.50 naira

2018-07-06,"NEW YORK, July 6 (Reuters) - World stock markets rose and the euro climbed to a three-week peak on Friday as the threat of tariffs by the United States and China on billions of dollars of trade became a reality, though concerns about the conflict escalating capped the appetite for risk. MSCI’s measure of world equities markets rose 0.4 percent to the highest level in a week while Asian stocks climbed nearly half a percent, led by a rebound in Chinese shares. Stocks dipped broadly in Europe, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.28 percent. U.S. equities edged higher in morning trade after monthly jobs data showing a 213,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in June and stable wage growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.69 points, or 0.02 percent, to 24,353.05, the S&P 500 gained 7.6 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,744.21 and the Nasdaq Composite added 41.21 points, or 0.54 percent, to 7,627.64. “The trade headlines are at this point keeping the market uncertain,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Signs of nervousness about the trade outlook were evident elsewhere in global markets with the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc firm against the dollar while core U.S. and German bonds were in demand. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 7/32 in price to yield 2.8145 percent, from 2.84 percent late on Thursday. “Trade war concerns have shot up to the top of our concerns for investors,” said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, chief multi-asset strategist at BlackRock Investment Institute in London. “We have to be aware that we are only one tweet away from much broader tariffs becoming a reality,” she said, adding that investors were trimming broad exposure to riskier assets. The latest flows data confirmed that trend. Investors have pulled money out of emerging markets and European equities more quickly over the last two months than in 2016, Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists said on Friday in a weekly note. The United States and China slapped tit-for-tat duties on $34 billion worth of each other’s imports on Friday, with Beijing accusing Washington of triggering the “largest-scale trade war” as the world’s two biggest economies sharply escalated their conflict. U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that the United States may ultimately target over $500 billion worth of Chinese goods, an amount that roughly matches its total imports from China last year. Copper, seen as a barometer of the world’s economic strength because of its wide industrial use, on Friday fell to near a one-year low, at $6,221.50 per tonne, before recouping some losses. U.S. crude rose 0.51 percent to $73.31 per barrel and Brent was last at $76.96, down 0.56 percent on the day. Reporting by David Randall; Additional reporting by Sinead

2018-07-06,"(Adds Senate president comment, context) ABUJA, July 6 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s Supreme Court on Friday dismissed all outstanding charges against Senate president Bukola Saraki related to alleged false declarations of assets. Saraki, one of the country’s most powerful politicians, has been dogged by accusations of misconduct and investigations since he became president of the upper house of parliament in 2015, though none has led to convictions. The original charges related to allegations that Saraki had falsely declared his assets when he was a state governor from 2003 to 2011, to which he had pleaded not guilty. A Code of Conduct Tribunal cleared him of the charges in June 2017, saying the case lacked substance. The Supreme Court upheld his appeal on Friday against a decision in December last year that he should still face three charges. “I am happy that I have been vindicated. The Supreme Court has affirmed that there is no evidence of false declaration of assets,” Saraki said in a statement. Saraki ran unopposed for the post of Senate president, mainly with the support of the opposition even though he is a member of the ruling All Progressives Congress. He was not the APC’s preferred candidate, which led to strains in his relationship with President Muhammadu Buhari. “This is a politically motivated case,” Saraki said in his statement, which did not name Buhari. “The case was trumped up in the first instance because of my emergence as the President of the Senate against the wishes of certain forces.” A presidency spokesman declined to comment. Saraki’s battles with the presidency are not the only fractures to have emerged in the APC before elections early next year. On Thursday, a faction of the APC split, declaring that it no longer supported the Buhari’s government and threatening his hopes of securing a second term.

2018-07-06,"KARLSRUHE, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) has lost a legal challenge to prevent prosecutors from examining unpublished documents about its emission scandal, with Germany’s top court ruling on Friday that files seized from a U.S. law firm may be reviewed. It means the information from the files may be made public as part of any criminal proceedings, thus providing more ammunition for shareholders and car owners seeking damages.  Shortly after the dieselgate scandal broke in September 2015, VW hired law firm Jones Day and advisory firm Deloitte to investigate the issue and look at who was responsible.  VW never published the findings of the Jones Day investigation, although a summary was compiled in the form of a “Statement of Facts” for the U.S. Department of Justice. Prosecutors searched the Munich offices of Jones Day in March 2017 in connection with a fraud probe related to 3.0 litre diesel engines made by VW’s premium unit Audi (NSUG.DE). VW fought the use of any files taken in the raid, and the constitutional court last July issued a temporary order blocking Munich prosecutors from assessing the material. The dismissal of VW’s legal challenge by the federal constitutional court on Friday is a further blow to VW, which is still grappling with the implications of the dieselgate scandal almost three years after it came to light. Munich state prosecutors said it was not yet clear when they would start to examine the seized folders and computer data, but that they hoped they would make their investigations easier.   Volkswagen shares were down 0.7 percent at 1328 GMT, slightly underperforming the DAX index of leading German shares.  The ruling comes just weeks after VW was fined 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) over emissions cheating, one of the highest fines ever imposed on a company by German authorities.  Munich prosecutors have also widened a probe into VW’s luxury brand Audi to include now suspended Chief Executive Rupert Stadler among the suspects accused of fraud and false advertising. Lawyers enjoy some protection from raids in Germany, but the court on Friday said that the seizure of the Jones Day documents did not infringe on VW’s right to a fair legal process. It said that as a U.S. firm, Jones Day could not ask for protection of the German constitution and that the lawyers themselves, who had complained, were not personally affected.  The court also said that there was a risk of abuse should lawyers be protected from raids in anything other than special circumstances, because evidence could be “purposefully stored with lawyers or only selectively published”.  VW said it welcomed the fact that the court’s decision brought some clarity on the issue, even if the court disagreed with the carmaker. The statement of facts, published as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities, detailed a concerted effort by certain VW employees to destroy documents in anticipation of an order to preserve them. The investigations singled out six senior managers below board level, an attorney and other VW employees. VW has argued that the development of illegal software, also known as “defeat devices”, was the work of low-level employees, and that no management board members were involved. U.S. prosecutors have challenged this by indicting VW’s former CEO Martin Winterkorn. Last month, Munich prosecutors arrested Audi CEO Stadler, though he has not been charged with any crime.

2018-07-06,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Etienne Rigo stands in his sun-baked vineyard in the centre of Belgium, enjoying the fruits of climate change. Rising temperatures are boosting the wine trade in Europe's northern climbs - production has quadrupled in Belgium since 2006, according to government figures. The amount of land given over to grapes there has risen even faster. For more information see tmsnrt.rs/2KCUMup But as well as the volume, there’s the taste. “Twenty years ago we had wines that had tastes of citrus, lemon and a bit grapefruit. Today we have wines that are closer to exotic products: lychee, pineapple. This is a notable evolution,” Rigo, co-owner of the Domaine de Mellemont winery, tells Reuters. “We had much lighter wines 20 years ago. Today, we have wines that are fatter, with a longer finish and a much longer persistence.” Twelve years ago, vines covered just 72 hectares (0.28 square miles) of Belgium, a country better known for its beers, data from Belgium’s economy ministry show.  Last year, that area had expanded almost five-fold to cover 343 hectares - still miniscule compared to neighbouring France, but a start. It is part of a clear pattern, according to Wim Thiery, a climate scientist at VUB university in Brussels. “We do clearly see a shift where regions in the Mediterranean which are currently suitable for viticulture will no longer be suitable in the future, or less and less suitable,” he said. “Instead, regions in northern Europe such as Belgium will become suitable in the future for vineyards and for wine growing.” There are downsides. Climate change has generally made weather more erratic which can hurt vineyards, says Thiery. But most of the changes have been more gradual. Production has climbed, tastes have evolved and the harvests have edged earlier at Domaine de Mellemont, 40 km (25 miles) southwest of Brussels.  Workers there used to call one of their picking seasons the All Saints Harvest because of its closeness to the festival at the end of October. “This year, we’re planning on harvesting our grapes around late September or early October,” says Rigo. When it comes to the changes he has seen in the last few years, he is happy to focus on the positive. “Belgian wine is very young. It is still in its adolescence when it comes to grape variety, terroir. In the coming years, I think we will discover some really fantastic things.” Reporting by Julia Echikson; Editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek and Andrew Heavens",https://uk.reuters.com/article/belgium-wine/climate-change-boosts-wine-production-in-beer-loving-belgium-idUKL8N1U2185,06 Jul 2018,"Etienne Rigo stands in his

2018-07-06,"VIENNA (Reuters) - World powers and Iran appeared to make no concrete breakthrough on Friday in talks to provide Tehran with an economic package to compensate for U.S. sanctions that begin taking effect in August.    Ministers from Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia met their Iranian counterpart in Vienna for the first time since U.S. President Donald Trump left a nuclear accord in May, but diplomats had seen limited scope for salvaging it. Trump pulled the United States out of the multinational deal under which sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for curbs on its nuclear programme verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Washington has since told countries they must stop buying the OPEC producer’s oil from Nov. 4 or face financial consequences.  Speaking after three hours of talks, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, who chaired the talks, read a statement from the six delegations repeating previously-announced broad priorities ranging from guaranteeing Iranian oil revenue to shipping ties, banking and all other trade and investment co-operation. “Participants agreed to keep progress under close review and to reconvene the joint commission, including at ministerial level, as appropriate in order to advance common efforts,” Mogherini said, adding that all sides were determined to find and implement solutions.  Unlike at past meetings, Mogherini took no questions. “All the commitments made today , should be implemented before the August deadline ... it is up to the leadership in Tehran to decide whether Iran should remain in the deal ... the proposal was not precise and a complete one,” Mohammed Javad Zarif told reporters. Speaking earlier in the day, France’s foreign minister said that world powers would struggle to keep to that deadline. “They (Iran) must stop threatening to break their commitments to the nuclear deal,” Jean-Yves Le Drian said.  “We are trying to do it (economic package) before sanctions are imposed at the start of August and then the next set of sanctions in November. For August it seems a bit short, but we are trying to do it by November,” he said. On arrival in Vienna, Germany’s Foreign Minister Heiko Mass said he didn’t expect a collapse of talks, but suggested more negotiations would be needed in the future. He stressed hat world powers would struggle to compensate Tehran for companies leaving Iran. The pillars of the European Union’s strategy are: European Investment Bank lending, a special measure to shield EU companies from U.S. secondary sanctions, and a Commission proposal that EU governments make direct money transfers to Iran’s central bank to avoid U.S. penalties. “We’ve made some progress, including on safeguarding some crude (oil) sales, but it’s unlikely to meet Iranian expectations. It’s also not just about what the Europeans can do, but also how the Chinese, Russians, Indians, others can contribute,” said a senior European diplomat. Iranian officials have said that key for them is to ensure measures that guarantee oil exports do not halt, and that Tehran still has access to the SWIFT international bank payments messaging system or an alternative.  “We are ready for all possible scenarios ... the collapse of the deal will increase the tension in the region. To save the deal, other signatories should compensate for U.S. sanctions,” a senior Iranian official told Reuters on Friday. During a visit to Europe this week President Hassan Rouhani warned that Iran could reduce its co-operation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog, having already threatened Trump of the  “consequences” of fresh sanctions against Iranian oil sales.  Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have also warned that they may block oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz in response to U.S. calls to ban all Iranian oil exports.  On the nuclear side of the agreement the parties did agree to replace the United States in a working group to redesign the Arak reactor with China. The deal specifies that the new design will aim to minimise the production of plutonium and to prevent the production of weapon-grade plutonium in normal operation. It also specifies the fuel Arak must use and says its spent fuel for the reactor’s lifetime must be shipped out of Iran.

2018-07-06,"* NOC head says east stepped up efforts to sell oil * Cites attempted shipment in May, discounted contracts * Previous attempts have been blocked by Western powers * Closure of eastern ports cut output by 850,000 bpd By Aidan Lewis TUNIS, July 6 (Reuters) - Libya’s Tripoli-based National Oil Corporation (NOC) is asking for U.N. sanctions against 48 individuals and entities they accuse of trying to sell oil illicitly in a struggle over the country’s oil wealth. In a letter circulated to foreign embassies and the United Nations, and seen by Reuters, NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla described a “surge” in attempts by eastern factions to market oil ahead of them taking control last month of key fields and export terminals. Since 2014 Western powers and U.N. Security Council resolutions have backed the NOC in Tripoli, the capital, as the sole legitimate producer and seller of Libyan oil, warning that illicit exports could lead to further fragmentation of the divided country. That has deterred buyers and banks wary of dealing with an unrecognised entity. But Sanalla’s letter and copies of contracts that NOC Tripoli says were passed on by people involved in oil trading allege that a parallel NOC in the eastern city of Benghazi has stepped up its campaign to market oil under Faraj Said, head of the firm since last August. “This ‘NOC Benghazi’, headed by Faraj Said, is pursuing a complex and combined strategy, focussed on destabilising NOC, including via illicit exports, contracts and blockades, to ultimately gain control of Libyan oil,” Sanalla wrote. The letter was sent mid-June, about 10 days before forces loyal to eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar announced that they would hand east Libyan ports and fields to the Benghazi NOC, raising the stakes over the contest for the sparsely populated country’s oil. Production has plummeted by about 850,000 barrels per day (bpd) from little more than one million bpd, as eastern officials have blocked tankers booked by NOC Tripoli from loading, effectively shutting Zueitina and Hariga ports. Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) has also prevented NOC Tripoli from reopening Ras Lanuf and Es Sider, after fending off an armed attack against the ports last month. The standoff is part of a wider conflict that developed after the Nato-backed uprising against Muammar Gaddafi seven years ago. Factions aligned with rival governments in the east and west have competed for power since disputed elections in 2014. About three-quarters of Libya’s oil production is based in the east, but oil sales and revenues have been processed through Tripoli, home to an internationally backed interim government. Some in the east have long complained that they receive too few oil revenues, though officials in Tripoli dispute that. The LNA said this week that it was seeking the replacement of the central bank governor in Tripoli, who it also blames for funnelling money to its armed opponents — a charge that central bank officials in the capital deny. Said and his office could not be reached for comment. He told Reuters last week that NOC east, which claims legitimacy through an eastern parliament and government, was not “rushing” oil sales. “The important thing is for the oil money to go to a safe place,” he said. Sanalla’s letter says that even before eastern factions announced they would take over oil ports, they had tried in May to export 600,000 barrels from Hariga port on a tanker named Phaedra Bright 1, but the tanker was persuaded to turn back before it loaded. According to NOC Tripoli, NOC Benghazi has been offering buyers substantial discounts that would lead to losses in revenue of at least $821 million. NOC Tripoli estimates that Libya is already losing more than $67 million daily because of the port stoppages. Sanalla called for travel bans and asset freezes under a U.N. sanctions regime to be imposed on Said and other senior NOC Benghazi officials, as well as on traders and energy companies allocated contracts by the eastern NOC. Failure to act could have “grave consequences for peace and security in Libya”, Sanalla wrote. “In particular, I am concerned that these efforts may accelerate ahead of the elections planned for December, and that they may create conditions that interfere with the acceptance by certain segments of the Libyan population of election results.” Additional reporting by Ayman al-Warfalli in Benghazi; Editing

2018-07-06,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria’s Supreme Court on Friday dismissed all outstanding charges against the Senate president related to alleged false declarations of assets, his spokesman said.  Bukola Saraki, one of the country’s most powerful politicians, has been dogged by accusations of misconduct and investigations since he became president of the upper house of parliament in 2015, though none have led to convictions. The original charges related to allegations that Saraki had falsely declared his assets when he was a state governor from 2003 to 2011, to which he had pleaded not guilty. A Code of Conduct Tribunal cleared him of the charges in June 2017, saying the case against him lacked substance. The Supreme Court on Friday upheld his appeal against a decision in December last year that he should still face three charges. “Supreme Court upholds the appeal of the senate president Dr Abubakar Bukola Saraki and held that he has no case to answer before the CCT,” said a spokesman in a text message. Saraki ran unopposed for the post of Senate president, mainly with the support of the opposition. He was not the ruling party’s preferred candidate, which led to strains in his relationship with President Muhammadu Buhari. He has been the subject of numerous legal cases and accusations since taking office. Nigerian police last month asked him to answer questions over allegations that he financed a criminal gang that carried out a spate of armed robberies. Saraki denied any involvement..

CPC and Lanka IOC, the only other local fuel retailer and a subsidiary of Indian Oil Corp, had raised the price of diesel by 8.3 percent to 118 rupees ($0.7417). Gasoline prices went up by around 5.8 percent. However, hours after the announcement, CPC asked its fuel stations to reverse the price hike. “The CPC has issued a circular asking its stations not to increase the prices as it is not in favour of a price hike,” Sudarshana Gunawardana, the director general at the government’s Information Department told Reuters. CPC was not immediately available for comment. According to the government regulations, the finance ministry has the authority to decide the fuel price. It can revise the pricing formula every two months. Ali Hassen, director of information at the finance ministry, told Reuters that the finance ministry has been considering whether decide fuel rates on a weekly basis. CPC has about two third of the island nation’s retail fuel market, while Lanka IOC has the rest. CPC had been under pressure to increase its prices after incurring a loss of 9.9 billion rupees ($64 million) in the first two months of the year due to rising oil prices. The government cut petrol prices in January 2015 after President Maithripala Sirisena was voted into office. It did not increase prices until May this year, fearing unpopularity among voters. Under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to boost revenue, Sri Lanka increased excise duty on diesel by 10 rupees to 13 rupees per litre from August last year but asked fuel retailers not to pass on the cost to consumers.

2018-07-06,"* Swiss Re to stop underwriting some coal business * Scor the only other reinsurer to have done so * Munich Re says looks “repeatedly” at the issue By Simon Jessop, Carolyn Cohn and Tom Sims LONDON/FRANKFURT, July 6 (Reuters) - Munich Re, the world’s biggest reinsurer, said it would keep underwriting coal-related businesses, defying investors keen for it to follow a partial ban by its rival Swiss Re. It, however, said it looked at the issue “repeatedly”. Policymakers are pushing companies to do more to help meet a target, agreed in Paris in 2015, to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius. Investors are increasingly using their financial muscle to reward those at the forefront of that transition. Swiss Re, world number two by share value, said this week it would not reinsure any company for which thermal coal represents more than 30 percent of its business. It follows French peer Scor, which last year said it would stop underwriting new thermal coal mines. While not enough for some campaigners, the moves are seen forcing smaller insurers to reconsider underwriting companies involved in coal production. Reinsurers help insurers share the burden of large risks in return for part of the premium. Despite being a vocal supporter of the Paris deal, Munich Re said it did not plan to copy Swiss Re in limiting its underwriting of coal companies. “Munich Re will continue to insure all types of companies, taking into account an assessment of all risk aspects – including environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria,” a spokesman told Reuters. That position could become increasingly untenable, though, as investors seek more detail from the companies they own, driven on by policymakers, particularly in Europe, leading Munich Re investors told Reuters. “From a risk perspective, every insurer should have a (underwriting) policy on coal,” said Ingo Speich, fund manager at Union Investment, a top-10 Munich Re investor. “We haven’t seen any strict policy yet. Is it bad for the company from an outside perspective? In general, yes.” Sasja Beslik, head of sustainable finance at Nordea, whose fund arm is a top-30 investor in Munich Re, said the Swiss Re move was significant and while others were not moving quickly enough, they would also be pushed by investors. “Not only us, but the entire industry,” Beslik said, citing plans by the European Commission to force investors to integrate sustainability into their decision-making. Reducing insurance coverage of the coal sector raises costs for coal power generation, “which is important given the need to rapidly decline coal use to meet carbon targets”, another top-20 investor said. Hermes Investment Management, a shareholder advisor to institutions running more than 300 billion pounds ($397.35 billion) in assets through its EOS team, said it was currently engaging with Munich Re on climate change, among other topics. Investors and lobby groups say changing underwriting behaviour is crucial to encourage a transition away from coal, the biggest emitter of carbon. No firm has yet opted to stop insuring the industry completely, though, as increased climate change risk can lead to higher profit-boosting premiums and coal demand remains strong, particularly in developing countries.

2018-07-06,"* World stocks up 0.2 pct, China shares rise * Tariffs on Chinese goods kick in, Beijing retaliates * Economic barometer copper falls * Market volatility falls even as uncertainty rises By Saikat Chatterjee LONDON, July 6 (Reuters) - Stocks rose and the euro climbed to a three-week peak as the imposition of tariffs by the United States and China on billions of dollars of trade was absorbed calmly by markets on Friday, though concerns about the conflict escalating capped appetite for risk. World stocks rose 0.2 percent to their highest level in a week while Asian stocks climbed nearly half a percent led by a rebound in Chinese shares. MSCI’s main European Index edged a quarter of a percent higher and held below a two-week peak partly on cautious hopes of a rapprochement between the United States and Europe on auto trade tariffs. U.S. equities looked set for a more cautious start, however, with stock futures down 0.2 percent. Investors are looking at monthly U.S. jobs data after U.S. Federal Reserve minutes released overnight showed policymakers expressing concerns about the economy. Signs of nervousness about the trade outlook were also evident elsewhere in global markets with the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc firm against the dollar while core U.S. and German bonds in demand. “Trade war concerns have shot up to the top of our concerns for investors,” said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, chief multi-asset strategist at BlackRock Investment Institute in London. “We have to be aware that we are only one tweet away from much broader tariffs becoming a reality,” she said, adding that investors were trimming back broad exposure to riskier assets. Latest flows data confirm that trend. Investors have pulled money out of emerging markets and European equities faster than in 2016 over the last two months, Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists said on Friday in a weekly note. The United States and China slapped tit-for-tat duties on $34 billion worth of the other’s imports on Friday, with Beijing accusing Washington of triggering the “largest-scale trade war” as the world’s two biggest economies sharply escalated their conflict. But despite the threat of more tariffs, global markets remained broadly sanguine with gauges of market volatility in equities and currencies edging lower this week. For example, implied volatility, a measure of expected market swings on the euro/dollar, has fallen to a one-month low this week while a market gauge on U.S. equities has edged lower. “What can definitively be said that we are entering a period of much greater uncertainty than before though this low volatility in markets is baffling,” said Neil Mellor, a senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon in London. In currency markets, the euro took cues from broadly firmer stocks and rose 0.1 percent on the day to a fresh three-week high at $1.1727 with broadly strong German industrial data also helping. The Chinese yuan weakened after choppy trade, keeping some distance from 11-month lows touched earlier this week while the dollar edged lower against a basket of currencies with U.S. jobs data later ahead eyed. The U.S. Labor Department is expected to report non-farm payrolls grew by 195,000 in June after surging by 223,000 in May. Monthly average hourly earnings probably rose 0.3 percent, taking the annual increase to 2.8 percent from 2.7 percent in May. “Any misses in today’s data could spur a wave of profit-taking - given signs that the USD rally looks to be running out of steam,” said analysts at ING. U.S. President Donald Trump has warned the United States may ultimately target over $500 billion worth of Chinese goods, an amount that roughly matches its total imports from China last year. Copper, seen as a barometer of the world’s economic strength because of its wide industrial use, on Friday fell to near a one-year low, at $6,221.50 per tonne, before recouping some losses. The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was at 2.553 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.561 percent. U.S. crude stood 0.2 percent higher at $73.09 a barrel. Brent crude was almost flat at $77.42 per barrel.

2018-07-06,"BEIJING (Reuters) - It is not often that the niche world of commodities trading enters the public conversation, but on Friday China’s social media was rooting for a ship carrying soybeans from the United States to beat the deadline before Chinese tariffs kicked in. Tracking the journey of the vessel, Peak Pegasus, as it motored toward the northern Chinese port of Dalian was the 34th-highest trending topic on the country’s Twitter-like Weibo on Friday, beating out the World Cup, showbiz gossip and Beijing’s escalating trade war with Washington. Reuters was the first to report on the final stages of the vessel’s one-month voyage to China as the countdown began for the United States and China to impose their tit-for-tat duties on $34 billion worth of each other’s goods. Weibo users offered encouragement and support to the cargo,  which left Seattle on June 8, as it became uncertain whether the ship would dock and unload its cargo before noon on Friday when the new tariffs took effect. “Good luck bro!” said one Weibo user. “You are no ordinary soybean!” said another.  Soybeans are the top U.S. agricultural export to China, with the trade worth $12.7 billion in 2017.    Last week, the Peak Pegasus had been scheduled to land with just hours to spare, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon shipping data. Its arrival was pushed back in recent days to 5 p.m. (0900 GMT) on Friday.  Alas, the Peak Pegasus fell short. At 5:30 p.m., it was at anchor near Dalian, missing the noon deadline.   The comments showed how aspects of Beijing’s rift with Washington have seeped into the public consciousness. They also offered a rare moment of humor in an increasingly acrimonious row between the world’s top two economies. Chinese state media have slammed the protectionist policies of U.S. President Donald Trump and on Friday likened his administration to a “gang of hoodlums”, but the trade conflict has gained little traction on China’s tightly controlled social media. Still, one Weibo user with tongue firmly in cheek worried that the soybeans might get seasick, while another offered the beans some wry advice on how to avoid getting snarled up in the deepening row. “Poor little soybeans. Try to become a bean sprout, maybe it’s not on the tariff list,” the user said. One post offered to take the beans on a romantic break to Turkey.          It is not the first time the Peak Pegasus has had a starring role in Beijing’s trade showdown with Washington. In April, the ship detoured to South Korea from southern China after the country imposed hefty margin deposits on imports of U.S. sorghum, a grain used to make liquor and animal feed.

2018-07-06,"BEIJING, July 6 (Reuters) - China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) is expected to sign a preliminary agreement with Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) later this month to invest in oil and gas exploration and refinery projects, four sources with knowledge of the matter said. The agreement will be signed during a high-level Chinese state visit to the United Arab Emirates during which CNPC Chairman Wang Yilin will be on the business delegation. “It will be a preliminary and broad cooperation deal that covers upstream and downstream investment,” said one of the sources, a Beijing-based oil executive briefed on Wang’s planned trip. CNPC International, the state major’s overseas investment arm for oil and gas exploration and production, is taking the lead in talks with ADNOC, the executive added. A CNPC spokesman declined to comment on the deal. An ADNOC spokesman said the company has received “significant interest” from the market as well as from existing and new partners since it announced its plan to expand its strategic partnership model, but declined to comment on the specific deal. China will host a high level China-Arab summit next Tuesday where President Xi Jinping will deliver the keynote speech. “We see a trend of some Gulf countries such as Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Saudi Arabia moving to diversify away from their oil and gas reliant economy, by divesting some of those assets to free up capital for other sectors,” said a second source, a CNPC official. ADNOC announced in April its first ever competitive exploration and production licensing round of six oil and gas blocks, with bids due by October. CNPC is set to join the bidding, said a separate CNPC source with knowledge of the matter. ADNOC plans to double its refining capacity and triple petrochemicals output potential by 2025, as the state energy firm focuses more on downstream expansion to capture new growth markets. CNPC, which runs its Middle East operation out of Dubai, last March won 10 percent stakes in two ADNOC offshore oilfield concessions under a 40-year deal that cost $1.2 billion. That followed an 8 percent interest CNPC won in 2017 for $1.8 billion in Abu Dhabi’s giant onshore oilfield concession. CNPC already operates refineries in Japan, Singapore, Sudan, Scotland and France, and is recently negotiating with Brazil for a partnership that could give China its first refining capacity in the Americas.

2018-07-06,"LONDON, July 6 (Reuters) - Investors have pulled money out of emerging markets and European equities faster than in 2016 over the last two months, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) strategists said on Friday, as fears about the impact of a trade war took their toll. Some $24 billion has been withdrawn from European equity funds and $13 billion from emerging market equities in the past eight weeks, the bank said, as the United States stepped up its attack on its key trading partners. In recent weeks the United States has threatened to impose a 20 percent tariff on cars imported from the European Union (EU), after hitting the EU, Canada and Mexico with tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium at the start of June. The EU has responded by imposing its own import duties of 25 percent on a range of U.S. goods, including steel and aluminium products, farm produce such as sweetcorn and peanuts, bourbon, jeans and motor-bikes. On Friday, Washington slapped tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports, with Beijing responding in kind. U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that the U.S. may ultimately impose tariffs on more than a half-trillion dollars’ worth of Chinese goods. The tit-for-tat tariffs have raised fears of a full-blown and protracted trade war that threatens to damage the world economy, sending investors running for cover. “Risk appetite (is) much diminished,” the bank’s analysts said. In the week to July 4, investors pulled some $2.9 billion from European equities, racking up a 17th straight week of outflows, while emerging market stocks funds lost $1 billion in their seventh losing week. European stocks are down almost two percent year-to-date, while emerging equities have lost nearly nine percent, putting them near the bottom of BAML’s league table of cross-asset winners and losers. European stocks found some relief this week as the U.S. offered to suspend its threats to impose tariffs on cars if the EU lifts its duties on U.S. cars, according to press reports. Overall, outflows from global equities were modest, totalling just $300 million, following massive losses in the previous week. Redemptions from U.S. equity funds were also small, at $400 million, while Japanese stocks enjoyed $2.3 billion of inflows. BAML analysts noted that a rally of 30 basis points in U.S. Treasuries had sparked big inflows into government bond funds, which attracted some $2.7 billion, a 12-week high. Real estate investment trusts also attracted $500 million, their biggest inflows in a year, but emerging market debt funds lost $1.5 billion in an 11th week of redemptions.

2018-07-06,"* U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods came into effect Friday * China retaliates, duty on U.S. crude possible * U.S. plans new sanctions against oil exporter Iran (Adds detail of potential tariff on U.S. crude imports to China) By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, July 6 (Reuters) - Asian oil refiners are racing to secure crude supplies in anticipation of an escalating trade war between the United States and China, and as Washington plans tough sanctions against Iran aimed at shutting the country out of oil markets. As part of a wave of retaliation for Friday’s U.S. tariffs, China has threatened a 25 percent duty on imports of U.S. crude. Meanwhile, Washington’s new sanctions against Tehran are due to kick in from November. That double whammy is prompting Asian refiners to move swiftly, with South Korea leading the way. Under pressure from Washington, Seoul has halted all orders of Iranian oil, according to sources, even as it braces from spillover effects from the U.S.-China tit-for-tat on trade. “As South Korea’s economy heavily relies on trade, it won’t be good for South Korea if the global economic slowdown happens because of a trade dispute between U.S and China,” said Lee Dal-seok, senior researcher at the Korea Energy Economic Institute (KEEI). In China, state media slammed U.S. President Donald Trump’s government as a “gang of hoodlums”, with officials vowing retaliation. Standing in the line of fire are U.S. crude supplies to China, which have surged from virtually zero before 2017 to 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) in July. Although just 5 percent of China’s overall crude imports, these supplies are worth $1 billion a month at current prices - a figure that seems certain to fall should a duty be implemented. U.S. crude oil is not on the list of 545 products the Chinese government has said it would immediately retaliate with in response to American duties. However, crude oil is listed as a U.S. product that will receive an import tariff at an unspecified later date. While no date has been set, industry participants expect the tariff to be levied. “The Chinese have to do the tit-for-tat, they have to retaliate,” said John Driscoll, director of consultancy JTD Energy, adding that cutting U.S. crude imports was a means “of retaliating (against) the U.S. in a very substantial way”. In an early sign of future times, an executive from China’s Dongming Petrochemical Group, an independent refiner from Shandong province, said his refinery had already cancelled U.S. crude orders. “We expect the Chinese government to impose tariffs on (U.S.) crude,” the executive said, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak to media. “We will switch to either Middle East or West African supplies,” he said. JTD Energy’s Driscoll said China may even replace American oil with crude from Iran. “They (Chinese importers) are not going to be intimidated, or swayed by U.S. sanctions,” he said. In Japan, Asia’s third-biggest importer of crude, the oil industry has yet to react publicly to Friday’s news. The Petroleum Association of Japan previously warned refiners will have to stop loading Iranian crude oil from October if Tokyo doesn’t win an exemption on U.S.-Iran sanctions. Amid the turmoil, some in the region spot opportunity. “If China retaliates with tariffs on U.S. crude, that could improve South Korea’s terms of buying U.S. crude...because the U.S. would need a market to sell to,” said the KEEI’s Lee. Highlighting that issue, JTD Energy’s Driscoll said U.S. oil sellers were “already discounting” their crude. Reporting by Henning Gloystein and Florence Tan in SINGAPORE,

Chinese shares led a recovery by Asian market, partly helped by the perception that the tariff measures were already priced in though worries about what lay ahead for global markets boosted appetite for perceived safe-haven assets such as government debt and the Japanese yen. “Some of it is priced in but then this is an ongoing story and what can definitively be said that we are entering a period of much greater uncertainty than before,” said Neil Mellor, a senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon in London. World stocks rose 0.2 percent to their highest level in a week while Asian stocks climbed nearly half a percent led by a rebound in Chinese shares. U.S. tariffs on more than 800 goods from China worth $34 billion took effect at 0401 GMT while China’s commerce ministry said in a statement shortly after the deadline passed that it was forced to retaliate, meaning $34 billion worth of imported U.S. goods including autos and agricultural products also faced 25 percent tariffs. MSCI’s main European Index edged 0.1 percent higher and held below a two-week high hit in the previous session amid hopes of a rapprochement between the U.S. and Europe on auto trade tariffs. The euro took cues from broadly firmer stocks and rose 0.1 percent on the day to a fresh three-week high at $1.1727 with broadly strong German industrial data this week also boosting demand for European stocks. To be sure, signs of nervousness were evident in markets with the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc firm against the dollar while core U.S. and German bonds in demand. “The China-U.S. relationship is such a large component of global trade that we really have a global impact and that has implications that are difficult to foresee,” said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asia economic research at HSBC in Hong Kong. U.S. President Donald Trump has warned the United States may ultimately target over $500 billion worth of Chinese goods, an amount that roughly matches its total imports from China last year. Copper, seen as a barometer of the world’s economic strength because of its wide industrial use, on Friday fell to near a one-year low, at $6,221.50 per tonne, before recouping some losses. In the currency market, the Chinese yuan weakened after choppy trade, keeping some distance from 11-month lows touched earlier this week. The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was at 2.553 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.561 percent. U.S. crude stood 0.2 percent higher at $73.09 a barrel. Brent crude was almost flat at $77.42 per barrel.

2018-07-06,"KARLSRUHE, Germany, July 6 (Reuters) - A German federal court on Friday ruled that Munich prosecutors may use files seized last year during a raid on Jones Day, the U.S. law firm that Volkswagen had hired to investigate its emissions scandal. Shortly after the dieselgate scandal broke in September 2015, VW hired Jones Day and advisory firm Deloitte to investigate the circumstances of its wrongdoing and who was responsible. Prosecutors in March 2017 searched the Munich-based offices of Jones Day and the headquarters of VW’s Audi brand. VW fought the use of any files taken in the raid, and the constitutional court in July issued a temporary order blocking Munich prosecutors from assessing the material. The court on Friday dismissed VW’s legal challenge and said that the seizure of the Jones Day documents did not infringe on VW’s right to a fair legal process. Reporting by Ursula Knapp

For the start August it seems a bit short, but we are trying to do it by November,” he said.

2018-07-06,"BEIJING, July 6 (Reuters) - Washington imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports on Friday and Beijing has said it will retaliate with punitive measures on U.S. products worth a similar amount, including soybeans, pork and cotton. The Chinese government had not officially confirmed on Friday afternoon that the retaliatory tariffs had taken effect. But the tit-for-tat measures have escalated the trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies and the world’s commodities markets are increasingly embroiled in the bust-up. The higher U.S. tariffs went into effect just after noon in Beijing (0401 GMT). The U.S. and China have also issued a second batch of proposed duties on $16 billion of each other’s goods. These would hit U.S. energy exports, such as coal and crude oil, among other areas. It is unclear when these will come into effect. Below is a detailed breakdown of the markets affected by the tariffs imposed and proposed: * Beijing’s tariffs will have the biggest impact on soybeans, the United States’ top agricultural export to China in 2017 worth about $12.7 billion, hurting U.S. farmers in states, such as Iowa and Texas, which backed Republican President Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Buying interest in U.S. beans from China, the world’s top importer of the oilseed, has slowed to a trickle ahead of the tariffs, with one remaining U.S. cargo heading for China still on the water. The vessel, Peak Pegasus, carrying 70,000 tonnes of the U.S. oilseed for state grain trader Sinograin, was due to arrive in the port of Dalian at 5:00 p.m. (0900 GMT) on Friday, just hours after the duties went into effect. Some shipments marked for China were due to be loaded from the U.S. Pacific Northwest, and are likely to get sent elsewhere as exporters scramble to avoid paying the tariff, a U.S. trader said. In the months ahead though, China will struggle to replace the U.S. beans, forcing processors, which crush the beans to make oil and animal feed, to pay the extra duty or find substitutes. Rabobank reckons China may have to buy up to 15 million tonnes of U.S. beans at tariff prices. Crushers may not pass on the inflated cost at least in the short term, further eroding their already low margins, the bank said in a research note. The biggest impact will likely be seen in sales of the next U.S. crop, which will come to market in September. In the meantime, Brazil, the world’s top exporter, will likely pick up the slack, although a trade association warned on Thursday the South American country may need to import the oilseed from the United States this year to satisfy demand from local processors. * U.S. pork was already saddled with duties enacted in an earlier round of the trade row and now faces an extra 25 percent tariff that would raise the total charges up to 62 percent. European pork will gain some ground over the U.S., which shipped almost $500 million worth of pork to China last year. U.S. shipments have nearly ground to a halt since the 25 percent tariffs implemented on April 2. * A record volume of U.S. crude oil is heading to China even as Beijing’s planned tariffs threaten to cut off a relatively new and burgeoning business for U.S. exporters. Nine vessels with 26.6 million barrels of crude oil loaded in Texas and Alaska and worth about $2 billion are due to land over the next five weeks, Thomson Reuters trade flow data shows. That equates to 700,000 barrels per day, 8 percent of China’s daily imports and a large volume for the United States, a newcomer to the Chinese market. If enacted, the import duty would make U.S. oil less competitive than other crudes, likely causing a decline in Chinese purchases and forcing U.S. oil firms to find other buyers. Amid a relatively well-supplied global oil market, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said the United States “would find it hard to find an alternative market that is as big as China,” as Chinese buyers make up 20 percent of U.S. overseas crude sales. China would likely replace the lost U.S. barrels from their top sellers Russia or Saudi Arabia, which have recently announced plans to raise output. Among other energy products, China noticeably spared U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from potential import tariffs, but in doing so, it has preserved a potential weapon should the trade war with Washington deepen. However, coal could be caught in the crossfire if the second batch of duties are introduced. Replacing American shipments with coal from other places would not be difficult for China, but a loss of business with the world’s top importer of the fuel would hurt companies in West Virginia, a state that heavily favoured Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

Spread-betters forecast a rise of 0.5-0.6 percent when Britain’s FTSE, France’s CAC and Germany’s DAX open on Friday. Mainland Chinese shares led Asia’s recovery, partly helped by the perception that the tariff measures were already priced in. To be sure, there was some trepidation about what lay ahead. “The China-U.S. relationship is such a large component of global trade that we really have a global impact and that has implications that are difficult to foresee,” said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asia economic research at HSBC in Hong Kong. But he also said he was “fairly relaxed” about the tariffs and trade dispute. “It’s a drag on growth. I don’t think it’s as disruptive as often described,” Neuman said. “China’s position is strong enough to avoid a hard landing in the current scenario.” MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan , which dropped 0.5 percent early in the day, had gained 0.6 percent by mid-afternoon. The Shanghai Composite index was up 0.4 percent. In the morning, it fell 1.6 percent to 2,691, within sight of a January 2016 low of 2,638, then later it was more than 1 percent up. Japan’s Nikkei stock index rose 1.1 percent, recovering from Thursday’s three-month low. The U.S. tariffs on more than 800 goods from China worth $34 billion took effect at 0401 GMT but its quiet start prompted short-covering by those who had feared for fresh retaliatory measures. China’s commerce ministry said in a statement shortly after the deadline passed that it was forced to retaliate, meaning $34 billion worth of imported U.S. goods including autos and agricultural products also faced 25 percent tariffs. Many economists say the direct impact of the tariffs would be contained, given the current strength of the global economy, but investors remained wary. “When economists run various economic models, they get estimates that it will slash U.S. GDP only by 0.1 percentage point,” said Kozo Koide, chief economist in Tokyo for Asset Management One. “That would be true if this tariffs would be imposed only for a year. But you don’t know how long this will continue. Such uncertainties will surely affect companies’ spending and hiring plans. Markets are worried the economy may lose momentum earlier than previously thought,” he added. President Donald Trump has warned the United States may ultimately target over $500 billion worth of Chinese goods, an amount that roughly matches its total imports from China last year. Copper, seen as a barometer of the world’s economic strength because of its wide industrial use, on Friday fell to near a one-year low, at $6,221.50 per tonne, then bounced back to $6,330. In the currency market, the yuan stood flat after choppy trade, keeping some distance from its 11-month lows touched earlier this week. The renminbi traded at 6.6534 per dollar  down 0.25 percent on the day, compared to Tuesday’s low of 6.7204. The dollar was little changed against the yen at 110.67 while the single currency was down a hair on the day at $1.1685. U.S. payroll and wage data due later on Friday is the next focus for traders. The minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting on June 12-13 showed policymakers discussed whether recession lurked around the corner, and expressed concerns global trade tensions could hit an economy that by most measures looked strong. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 2.841 percent, compared with a U.S. close of 2.840 percent. The two-year yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was at 2.553 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.561 percent. Oil prices remained well-bid after initial falls following U.S. government data showing an unexpected jump in crude oil stockpiles. Tensions between the U.S. and Iran continued to rise as the U.S. Navy said it stood ready to ensure free navigation and the flow of commerce, after Iran’s Revolutionary Guards threatened to block oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz. U.S. crude stood 0.4 percent higher at $73.19 a barrel. Brent crude was almost flat at $77.42 per barrel.

2018-07-06,"* U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods came into effect Friday * China retaliates, duty on U.S. crude possible * U.S. plans new sanctions against oil exporter Iran By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, July 6 (Reuters) - Asian oil refiners are racing to secure crude supplies in anticipation of an escalating trade war between the United States and China, and as Washington plans tough sanctions against Iran aimed at shutting the country out of oil markets. As part of a wave of retaliation for Friday’s U.S. tariffs, China has threatened a 25 percent duty on imports of U.S. crude. Meanwhile, Washington’s new sanctions against Tehran are due to kick in from November. That double whammy is prompting Asian refiners to move swiftly, with South Korea leading the way. Under Washington’s gaze, Seoul pressure has halted all orders of Iranian oil, according to sources, even as it braces from spillover effects from the U.S.-China tit-for-tat on trade. “As South Korea’s economy heavily relies on trade, it won’t be good for South Korea if the global economic slowdown happens because of a trade dispute between U.S and China,” said Lee Dal-seok, senior researcher at the Korea Energy Economic Institute. In China, state media slammed U.S. President Donald Trump’s government as a “gang of hoodlums”, with officials vowing retaliation. Standing in the line of fire are U.S. crude supplies to China, which have surged from virtually zero before 2017 to 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) in July. Although just 5 percent of China’s overall crude imports, these supplies are worth $1 billion a month at current prices - a figure that seems certain to fall. “The Chinese have to do the tit-for-tat, they have to retaliate,” said John Driscoll, director of consultancy JTD Energy, adding that cutting U.S. crude imports was a means “of retaliating (against) the U.S. in a very substantial way”. In an early sign of future times, an executive from China’s Dongming Petrochemical Group, an independent refiner from Shandong province, said his refinery had already cancelled U.S. crude orders. “We expect the Chinese government to impose tariffs on (U.S.) crude,” the executive said, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak to media. “We will switch to either Middle East or West African supplies,” he said. JTD Energy’s Driscoll said China may even replace American oil with crude from Iran. “They (Chinese importers) are not going to be intimidated, or swayed by U.S. sanctions,” he said. In Japan, Asia’s third-biggest importer of crude, the oil industry has yet to react publicly to Friday’s news. The Petroleum Association of Japan previously warned refiners will have to stop loading Iranian crude oil from October if Tokyo doesn’t win an exemption on U.S.-Iran sanctions. Amid the turmoil, some in the region spot opportunity. “If China retaliates with tariffs on U.S. crude, that could improve South Korea’s terms of buying U.S. crude...because the U.S. would need a market to sell to,” said Lee Dal-seok at the Korea Energy Economic Institute. Highlighting that issue, JTD Energy’s Driscoll said U.S. oil sellers were “already discounting” their crude. Reporting by Henning Gloystein and Florence Tan in SINGAPORE,

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.1 percent lower, pulling back from a modest early rise. The index has lost near 9 percent since June 7. The Shanghai Composite index ended morning trade down 0.3 percent, before the tariffs took effect, and trading will resume at 0500 GMT. Earlier on Friday, the index fell as much as 1.6 percent to 2,691, getting close to its January 2016 low of 2,638. “China will surely take retaliatory steps, to which U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened more tariffs,” said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. A trade war “now has become a reality,” he said. “If this was a boxing match, the first round has just begun. It is going to be a long process. Trump is unlikely to back down easily ahead of the U.S. mid-term elections (in November), especially given the recent rise in his popularity,” Fujito said. Seoul’s Kospi index, down in the morning, was flat fell 0.25 percent and shares in Taiwan were 0.e percent lower. Shares of Singapore, a major trading hub for the region, dropped more than 2.0 percent to 14-month lows. Japan’s Nikkei stock index rose 1.1 percent from Thursday’s three-month low, helped in part by a boost in automaker shares on signs Washington and the European Union may be seeking a compromise on tariffs on cars. “How that’s going to iron out, I think that’s still going to be a major point of contention. But at least they’re talking and I think while cooler heads prevail, that’s the positivity that’s emanated from the markets,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading APAC at OANDA. Japanese carmaker shares rose 1.4 percent, with Toyota Motor up 1.6 percent and Honda Motor up 1.5 percent. South Korea’s Hyundai Motor jumped 2.9 percent. In Europe, automakers’ shares jumped 3.4 percent on Thursday. Still, many market players remained cautious given the risk of further escalation in the trade war between China and the United States. Copper, seen as barometer of the world’s economic strength because of its wide industrial use, extended its losses to $6,236 per tonne, down 1.7 percent on the day. It has fallen 15 percent from its peak hit just a month ago. In the currency market, the yuan eased slightly in a choppy trade, though it kept some distance from its 11-momth lows touched earlier this week.

2018-07-06,"PARIS (Reuters) - Sovereign wealth funds managing more than $2 trillion (1.51 trillion pounds) are to lay out a strategy on Friday in Paris to pressure companies to be more climate-friendly, French officials said. President Emmanuel Macron, who has cast himself as the guardian of the Paris agreement on climate change since Washington announced it would pull out, is championing the initiative, which will bring together the heads of six sovereign funds to thrash out a pro-environment investment framework. The guidelines, which funds will ask the companies they  invest in to meet, are expected to influence other big asset managers, French presidential advisers said. “Beyond the colossal amounts these funds manage, it’s the snowball effect we’re betting on,” one adviser at Macron’s office said. “By getting them to make this joint pledge, there will be a ricochet effect spreading across global finance.” With five of the funds coming from oil-rich nations - Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Norway - and the sixth from New Zealand, the Elysee dismissed suggestions the funds could just be opportunistically jumping on the climate bandwagon.   “They could have told us: that’s none of your business,” the adviser said. “So a big part of our work has been to create trust and show there is political leadership to get them moving, showcase them. It’s not greenwashing.” Lawrence Yanovitch, an American national who is coordinating the initiative, said the funds understood it was in their financial interest to take account of the risks of climate change in their investments and that most of their countries were already seeking to transition towards low-carbon economies. “They also see a business opportunity,” the former Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation investment manager said. “Financial markets are risky because they don’t take these (climate) risks into account.” The guidelines will include obligations for companies to calculate their carbon footprints, he said. The initiative comes a year after U.S President Donald Trump said the United States, the world’s second biggest greenhouse gas emitter after China, would pull out of the deal brokered in Paris in 2015 to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees above pre-industrial times. Macron took a dig at Trump at the time, saying he would not give up the fight and will “make our planet great again.” That, and Macron’s background as a former investment banker, encouraged the sovereign funds to work with France on the framework, Yanovitch said. “They see him as a committed leader on climate,” he said. “He’s got this background, he’s a banker. He understood that the funds were the strategic entry point. If you motivate them, it will cascade down.”    Editing by Leigh Thomas and Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/france-climatechange/macron-gathers-worlds-top-sovereign-funds-to-send-climate-signal-idUKL8N1U049S,06 Jul 2018,"Sovereign wealth funds managing

2018-07-06,"* Fuel oil prices ease from multi-year highs as PSO imports less * Imports lower on ample domestic supply, cooler weather * Increased hydroelectric power gen also denting demand By Roslan Khasawneh SINGAPORE, July 6 (Reuters) - Pakistan State Oil (PSO) has reduced its fuel oil imports for power generation as monsoon rains have lowered the demand for electricity for cooling, contributing to a decline in fuel oil premiums from the multi-year highs reached last week. Since May, PSO has sought to import as much as 695,000 tonnes of fuel oil per month. The increased demand pushed fuel oil premiums higher since it occurred at the same time supplies typically become tighter during the Northern Hemisphere summer when fuel oil consumption for power generation rises, particularly in the Middle East. PSO has not awarded tenders seeking fuel oil for late-June, early-, and mid-July delivery after receiving offers from suppliers, said four trade sources. The company last imported fuel oil for delivery from June 11 to 20, the sources said. PSO still has outstanding tenders for imports for delivery from the end of July to September, according to the tender documents. PSO did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment. “The country has enough stock and they have local (fuel oil) production ... and monsoon has already started with some places getting a lot of rain so temperature has cooled down,” said one of the sources, a trader at a company that typically supplies PSO with fuel oil. The trader declined to be identified as he is not authorised to speak to the media. Increased monsoon rainfall in the country has also helped boost hydroelectric power generation, lowering the demand for fuel oil for electricity, the trade sources said. Pakistan this week saw its heaviest rains in 38 years. Pakistan’s lower fuel oil demand may have contributed to weakness in Asia’s fuel oil market this week, the four trade sources said. Premiums have retreated from recent multi-year highs reached in the previous week amid shortages of supply and strong demand. “I personally wouldn’t expect they import anything during this year … a cargo or two might surprise but not more than that,” the trader said. The lower fuel oil imports are occurring as Pakistan LNG, cancelled a tender seeking six cargoes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for delivery in July and August, two industry sources said on Wednesday. The country’s LNG imports are mainly used for power generation. PSO in December halted fuel oil imports as Pakistan ramped up its LNG consumption for its power sector. But strong seasonal demand for electricity in the summer months and technical issues at some of its newest gas-fired power plants renewed the country’s appetite for fuel oil.

The U.S. tariffs are due to take effect at 0401 GMT. At 0315 GMT, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.4 percent lower, pulling back from a modest early rise. The index has lost 8.9 percent since June 7. The Shanghai Composite index fell 1.1 percent to 2,706, getting close to its January 2016 low of 2,638. The blue-chip CSI300 index was down 0.9 percent. “China will surely take retaliatory steps, to which U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened more tariffs. Trade war has exited as a concept for some time but now it has become a reality,” said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.

U.S. and European shares had been boosted on Thursday by reassuring economic data from Germany, and as automakers’ shares jumped, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel saying she would back lowering European Union tariffs on U.S. car imports after Washington offered to scrap threatened tariffs on European cars. That backdrop of easing tensions helped the Nikkei’s broad rebound, with automaker Honda Motor Co jumping 2 percent and Toyota Motor Corp rising 1.9 percent. But in early trade on Friday, the focus remained on U.S. tariffs. On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that the United States would begin collecting tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports at 12:01 a.m. Washington time (0401 GMT) on Friday, and warned that subsequent rounds could see tariffs imposed on more than $500 billion worth of goods. “The risk that further escalation derails growth is keeping some investors cautious,” ANZ analysts said in a note Friday. The Sino-U.S. trade dispute has roiled financial markets including stocks, currencies and the global trade of commodities from soybeans to coal over the past several weeks. Newly released minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting on June 12-13 showed policymakers discussed whether recession lurked around the corner, and expressed concerns global trade tensions could hit an economy that by most measures looked strong. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 2.8364 percent, compared with a U.S. close of 2.840 percent.

2018-07-06,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Iran should make more effort to ensure stability in the Middle East and get along with its neighbours, a senior Chinese diplomat said on Friday, as Iran’s Revolutionary Guards warned they may block oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz. Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Kuwait are among China’s most important oil suppliers, while Qatar supplies liquefied natural gas to China, so any blockage of the strait would have serious consequences for its economy. But Beijing has had to tread carefully with Arab nations like Saudi Arabia as China also has close ties with Iran. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and some senior military commanders have threatened to disrupt oil shipments from the Gulf countries if Washington tries to strangle Tehran’s oil exports. Carrying one-third of the world’s seaborne oil every day, the Strait of Hormuz links Middle East crude producers to key markets in Asia Pacific, Europe, North America and beyond. Asked about the Iranian threat to the strait, Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Chen Xiaodong said that China and Arab countries had close communications about Middle East peace, including the Iran issue. “China consistently believes that the relevant country should do more to benefit peace and stability in the region, and jointly protect peace and stability there,” Chen told a news briefing, ahead of a major summit between China and Arab states in Beijing next week. “Especially as it is a country on the Gulf, it should dedicate itself to being a good neighbour and co-existing peacefully,” he added. “China will continue to play our positive, constructive role.” Ministers from 21 Arab countries are attending the summit, as well as Kuwait’s elderly ruler, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber al-Sabah. Chinese President Xi Jinping will give the opening address on Tuesday. Having previously been a bit player in past years, China has  stepped up its involvement in the Middle East since Xi came to power six years ago, including sending a frigate to evacuate foreign nationals from Yemen in 2015. Adding another layer to the careful diplomatic dance China will have to perform, Chen said Qatar will be represented at the summit too, though he did not say by whom. The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt imposed a boycott on tiny, gas-rich Qatar in June 2017, severing diplomatic and transport ties and accusing it of supporting terrorism, which it denies. “We call on all sides to meet each other halfway and give consideration to each other’s concerns, and find a way to alleviate the problem via dialogue,” Chen said.

2018-07-06,"SEOUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - South Korea will not lift any Iranian crude and condensate in July, halting all shipments for the first time in six years amid U.S. pressure to cut all imports of Iranian oil from November, three sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.  Japanese customers, however, are continuing to import for now, with multiple buyers considering buying Iranian oil through September loading, said a North Asia trading source familiar with Iranian oil shipping arrangements. The move by South Korea, one of Iran’s main customers in Asia along with China and Japan, comes as it is in talks to seek an exemption from U.S. curbs on buying Iranian oil, in line with a waiver it received during previous sanctions.  “There was pressure from the South Korean government to halt purchases,” said the source familiar with Iranian shipping arrangements. “South Korea overall is lifting zero oil (from Iran) for July loading.” Two other sources said South Korea cancelled July loadings of crude and condensate cargoes from Iran as it was uncertain whether the country would receive an exemption from U.S. sanctions on Iran trade. The cancellations mean South Korea will import no Iranian oil in August, the first month of zero imports since August 2012 when South Korean buyers put Iranian oil purchases on hold before getting a waiver to import limited amounts of Iran crude. The United States in May said it was walking away from an international deal on Iran’s nuclear programme. In late June, it demanded its allies halt all imports of Iranian oil from November and said exemptions were unlikely.    South Korean refiners have since curtailed their Iranian oil purchases and turned to alternative sources such as American and African crude due to expensive Middle East grades and uncertainty over trade with Iran. South Korean buyers of Iranian crude and condensate are SK Energy and SK Incheon Petrochemical, owned by SK Innovation (096770.KS), Hyundai Oilbank Corp [INPTVH.UL] and Hanwha Total Petrochemical Co [SMCHE.UL]. Japan, which reduced Iranian oil imports significantly during the previous Western sanctions on Tehran that were lifted in 2016, is also seeking an exemption from the latest U.S. sanctions on Iran. “Japanese buyers also nominated cargoes for August, though they were not allowed to buy additional crude on top of term contractual volumes,” the shipping source said.   Japanese oil refiners may have to stop loading Iranian crude oil from Oct. 1 if the government does not secure another exemption, the president of the Petroleum Association of Japan (PAJ) said last month.

2018-07-06,"* Foreign ministers meet for first time since U.S. exit * Iranians want guarantees on oil export revenue * Europeans proposing package of economic measures By John Irish and Francois Murphy VIENNA, July 6 (Reuters) - Iran wants world powers to present measures guaranteeing oil revenue and investment into the country despite U.S. sanctions when ministers meet on Friday to save the 2015 nuclear deal, but European states will fall short of its demands, diplomats said. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the multinational deal in May under which sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for curbs on its nuclear programme, verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Washington has since told countries they must stop buying the OPEC producer’s oil from Nov. 4 or face financial consequences. Foreign ministers from Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia meet with their Iranian counterpart in Vienna for the first time since Trump left the pact, but diplomats see limited scope for salvaging it. “The objective is to save the deal. We’ve made some progress, including on safeguarding some crude sales, but it’s unlikely to meet Iranian expectations. It’s also not just about what the Europeans can do, but also how the Chinese, Russians, Indians, others can contribute,” said a senior European diplomat. The pillars of the European Union’s strategy are: European Investment Bank lending, a special measure to shield EU companies from U.S. secondary sanctions and a Commission proposal that EU governments make direct money transfers to Iran’s central bank to avoid U.S. penalties. “The Iranians expect the others to say what we are going to do to keep the deal alive. We will have to see if it is going to be good enough for them,” an EU source added. Describing the Friday meeting as important, Iranian officials have said that key for them is to ensure measures that guarantee oil exports do not halt, and that Tehran still has access to the SWIFT international bank payments messaging system. During a visit to Europe this week President Hassan Rouhani warned that Iran could reduce its co-operation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog having already threatened Trump of the “consequences” of fresh sanctions against Iranian oil sales. Rouhani was quoted by state media and on his website after calls with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel as having told them he was disappointed with their package which did not go far enough. “SWIFT is the key but Iran has to stay in at least until the end of the year to maintain divisions between the EU and U.S., keep some credibility and try and survive amidst forthcoming sanctions,” said Sanam Vakil, Associate Fellow at Chatham House, a London-based international think tank. While talks are expected to focus purely on the nuclear deal, they come amid increasing rhetoric from the Trump administration, which argues that Iran poses a serious security threat. An Austria-based Iranian diplomat was among four people arrested on suspicion of plotting an attack on an Iranian opposition group in France last week. The issue could be a distraction in the Vienna talks. Iran has said it had nothing to do with the plot and has demanded the official be released without delay. Any confirmation that Iranian authorities were behind the plot could make it politically difficult for European leaders to continue to back the nuclear deal.

2018-07-06,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, who had been lauded by President Donald Trump for his aggressive efforts to roll back environmental regulations, resigned on Thursday under heavy fire for a series of ethics-related controversies. Pruitt was one of Trump’s most polarizing Cabinet members, slashing regulations on the energy and manufacturing industries, including a move to repeal President Barack Obama’s signature program to cut carbon emissions from power plants, dubbed the Clean Power Plan. He was also instrumental last year in lobbying Trump to withdraw the United States from the global 2015 Paris climate accord to combat global warming. But Pruitt lost favor with Trump’s inner circle after a string of controversies including first-class travel at taxpayer expense, lavish spending on security, the installation of a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office and accusations that he used his position to receive favors, such as a discounted rental on a high-end condo from an energy lobbyist’s wife. “The unrelenting attacks on me personally, my family, are unprecedented and have taken a sizable toll on all of us,” Pruitt said in his resignation letter.     Trump announced the resignation on Twitter and said EPA Deputy Administrator Andrew Wheeler, a former mining industry lobbyist, will become the regulatory agency’s acting chief on Monday. Wheeler is widely expected to continue Pruitt’s efforts to roll back and streamline regulation, something that Trump had promised in his presidential campaign. “Scott has done an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him for this,” Trump wrote. Trump told reporters later that Pruitt had approached him and offered to resign as opposed to being pushed out. Wheeler said in a message to EPA employees that he was “both humbled and honored” to lead the agency. “I look forward to working hard alongside all of you to continue our collective goal of protecting public health and the environment on behalf of the American people,” he said. Democrats and environmental advocacy groups cheered the departure of Pruitt, a close ally of the fossil fuel industry who has often questioned mainstream climate change science. “Scott Pruitt’s reign of venality is finally over. He made swamp creatures blush with his shameless excesses. All tolerated because Trump liked his zealotry. Shame,” Democratic Representative Gerry Connolly said. The Environmental Working Group, a public health and environment watchdog, called Pruitt “unquestionably the worst head of the agency in its 48-year history.” Pruitt, as Oklahoma’s attorney general before heading up the EPA, had sued the federal agency more than a dozen times on behalf of his oil-drilling state. Pruitt also rankled some Republican lawmakers, including in Midwest corn-producing states, with his efforts to overhaul a U.S. policy requiring biofuels like corn-based ethanol in gasoline. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa said Trump made the “right decision.” Other Republicans, as well as coal and oil industry groups, said in statements on Thursday that Pruitt had been a good friend to industry. “Scott Pruitt did great work to reduce the regulatory burdens facing our nation while leading the Environmental Protection Agency,” said Republican Senator Jim Inhofe, from Pruitt’s home state of Oklahoma. Pruitt’s interim replacement, Wheeler, was formerly a lobbyist for Murray Energy [MUYEY.UL], the country’s largest underground coal mining company, and also worked for Inhofe – a self-described climate skeptic - on efforts to combat climate legislation. Matt Dempsey, an energy lobbyist at consultancy FTI, said Wheeler will be less controversial than Pruitt but without altering the agenda. “He will be less political and more straightforward in his approach to the job, which is better for the Trump administration agenda in the long run. The politics will pass but the policy will remain,” Dempsey said. Pruitt was facing around a dozen investigations into his tenure, including his frequent use of first-class flights and his spending on security – which the agency has defended as necessary to defend him against unprecedented threats. Travel records showed the U.S. government spent $17,000 in taxpayer money on a December trip to Morocco to promote U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas, which is not part of the EPA’s jurisdiction. The Washington Post reported that a longtime Pruitt friend and lobbyist helped arrange the trip and later registered as a foreign agent representing Morocco. In one of the investigations, the U.S. Government Accountability Office concluded that the EPA violated two laws by installing the $43,000 phone booth for Pruitt’s office without telling lawmakers first. Pruitt said his staff never told him the cost. Some of the ethics accusations against Pruitt also involved jobs for his wife. Emails obtained by the Sierra Club environmental group showed Pruitt had an aide contact the chief executive of a fast-food chain about his wife becoming a franchise owner.  The Washington Post reported Pruitt had aides also try to get his wife a job at the Republican Attorneys General Association with a salary topping $200,000. Pruitt also had an employee carry out his personal errands, including researching the purchase of an old mattress from the Trump International Hotel, according to an interview transcript released by congressional Democrats last month. A source close to Trump said the controversy over the search for a used Trump International Hotel mattress was the last straw for Trump with Pruitt because it involved the Trump Organization. During congressional testimony in April, Pruitt was unapologetic for the controversies, often blaming his staff for any agency missteps.

2018-07-06,"(Repeats without change. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * United States and Saudi Arabia not aligned on oil price target * Higher gasoline costs threaten to wipe out U.S. tax cut benefit By John Kemp LONDON, July 5 (Reuters) - The United States and Saudi Arabia appear to have reached an understanding: Washington will reduce or eliminate Iran’s oil export revenues and in return Riyadh will guarantee oil supplies and stabilise prices. The basic deal is well understood by policymakers in both countries, with U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly emphasising his great personal relationship with the Saudi king and crown prince. But strong personal relationships between the leaders and agreement on the overall deal obscure disagreement on some key details, not least the desirable level for oil prices. Saudi Arabia and its allies believe prices should be stabilised around $75 a barrel. Trump, meanwhile, clearly thinks they should be stabilised at a significantly lower level. Trump made the link between Iran sanctions and Saudi production policy explicit in a television interview with Fox News on July 1. The United States will counter the influence of Iran, Saudi Arabia’s major regional rival, by imposing tough sanctions. In return Saudi Arabia will protect U.S. motorists against an increase in gasoline prices. The president noted that the United States provides security for Saudi Arabia and other Arab Gulf countries through the presence of military forces in the region. “We are protecting those countries, many of those countries,” he said. In a follow-up Twitter message on July 4, the president said that “the United States defends many of those countries for very little $’s”. U.S. and Saudi objectives are not fully aligned, however, on oil prices. Saudi Arabia’s objective, revealed at the OPEC meeting in June, has been to stabilise production and prices around current levels. The kingdom, its Gulf allies and Russia indicated that they will lift production by about 1 million barrels per day (bpd) to offset losses from Venezuela and Iran, but not more. The implication is that Saudi Arabia wants to keep prices around $75 a barrel and sees that level as sustainable in the medium term. Trump, however, is not satisfied with either the current level of oil prices or the announced production increase. “They have to put out another 2 million barrels in my opinion,” he said in the July 1 Fox interview. “Gas prices are up & they are doing little to help,” he complained again on Twitter on July 4. “This must be a two-way street. REDUCE PRICING NOW!” The United States has always been both a major producer and consumer of oil, which means that most presidents have favoured moderate oil prices. High prices hurt motorists and oil consumers across the country. Low prices hurt producers concentrated in Texas and other major petroleum states. From the perspective of the White House, the ideal price is not so low it causes problems for producing states but not so high it hurts consuming states. The rise in benchmark U.S. crude prices from a low of less than $30 a barrel in February 2016 to more than $70 in July 2018 has boosted the economies of Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota and other producing states. But most of those states are solidly Republican and likely to vote Trump’s party at the mid-term congressional elections in 2018. The president, therefore, is paying much closer attention to the harmful impact of higher oil and gasoline prices on consumers in swing states. The president’s repeated criticism of OPEC reflects his awareness that higher prices are already hitting a key section of his own electoral coalition. The average cost of gasoline has risen almost 60 percent from a cyclical low of $1.87 a gallon in February 2016 to $2.97 last month. U.S. motorists consume almost 143 billion gallons of gasoline each year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Most is used by private motorists, though some is bought by businesses, governments, the postal service and the armed services. Total annualised expenditure on gasoline has already risen by about $157 billion a year over the past 30 months. Every extra dollar on the price of a barrel of crude costs U.S. consumers roughly $3 billion a year, assuming refining margins and fuel taxes remain constant, and ignoring gasoline consumption by businesses and the like. Rising gasoline prices have a similar impact to a personal tax increase and have already countered much of the benefit from individual income tax cuts passed at the end of 2017. If the impact on consumer finances still seems small, a better way to understand the effect is to put the price impact on the same basis as the announced tax cuts. U.S. budget analysts generally look at the impact of tax changes over a ten-year period (“Estimated budget effects of the conference agreement for HR 1”, Joint Committee on Taxation, Dec. 18, 2017). The tax cuts approved at the end of 2017 were estimated to reduce individual income taxes by a little more than $1.1 trillion over ten years. By comparison, the rise in oil prices since the start of 2016 is the equivalent of a tax increase of almost $1.6 trillion over the next decade. The net impact of higher oil prices on the economy as a whole is obviously smaller because much of the extra revenue will be received by domestic oil producers. But producers and consumers are not the same, and the redistribution of income has real economic and political consequences. For many households, the gains from cuts passed last year have been offset by the rise in oil prices since 2016. While tax cuts went mostly to individuals in the upper income ranges, the burden of higher gasoline prices will be felt mostly by individuals on lower incomes because they spend a higher proportion of their earnings on fuel. (“Distribution effects of the conference agreement for HR 1”, JCT, Dec. 18, 2017). With critical elections ahead, the president has to be sensitive to the financial impact of higher fuel prices on swing voters, which is why he is pressing OPEC and Saudi Arabia to boost output enough to lower them.

China has said it would immediately retaliate with its own tariffs, and U.S. President Trump said on Thursday the United States may ultimately impose tariffs on more than a half-trillion dollars worth of Chinese goods, in what may become a fully blown trade war. “Things will get worse before they get better on trade... between the U.S. and China,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader. Beijing has said it may include a 25 percent tariff on U.S. crude oil imports, although it has not specified a date on which it would include that duty. American crude shipments to China currently stand around 400,000 barrels per day (bpd), worth around $1 billion a month at current market prices. A Chinese import tariff would make U.S. oil uncompetitive in China, forcing its refiners to seek alternative supplies elsewhere. That would happen in a global oil market that has steadily tightened this year. Energy consultancy FGE this week issued a stark warning of looming supply shortages due to U.S. sanctions against Iran and also because of disruptions elsewhere. “Iran’s exports are some 2.7 million bpd, including condensate,” it noted. FGE said the U.S. government may grant some waivers to allies that are particularly reliant on Iranian supplies and that some Iranian oil would also be smuggled into global markets. It estimated that once U.S. sanctions are fully implemented, some 1.7 to 2 million bpd of crude and condensate would be taken out of the market. “At the same time, Venezuela can do nothing to stop its own production decline and will lose another 400,000 bpd by year-end with production going to below 1 million bpd,” FGE said, adding that another 300,000 bpd of Libyan capacity was disrupted. Although Saudi Arabia and Russia have both said they would raise output to make up for these disruptions, FGE said “there simply is not enough capacity to make up for Iran’s crude losses, plus Venezuela and Libya”, and warned of the possibility of oil prices rising to $100 per barrel.

2018-07-06,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Thursday the United States may ultimately impose tariffs on more than a half-trillion dollars’ worth of Chinese goods as the world’s two largest economies hurtled toward the start of a trade war. Trump confirmed that the United States would begin collecting tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese goods at 12:01 a.m. Washington D.C. time (0401 GMT) on Friday and warned that subsequent rounds could see tariffs on more than $500 billion of goods, or roughly the total amount that the United States imported from China last year. “You have another 16 (billion dollars) in two weeks, and then, as you know, we have $200 billion in abeyance and then after the $200 billion, we have $300 billion in abeyance. Ok? So we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. Trump’s comments appeared to increase the stakes for potential retaliation by China. Previously, Trump had threatened up to impose additional tariffs on goods worth $400 billion  should China follow through on its plans to retaliate against the initial U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods including autos, computer disk drives, pump and valve parts and light-emitting diodes. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a notice it would begin collecting the 25 percent duties on 818 product lines identified in June by the U.S. Trade Representative’s Office. Beijing has vowed to immediately respond with an equal amount of tariffs of its own against U.S. autos, agricultural and other products, but it was unclear how swiftly the actions could escalate into an all-out trade war. There was no evidence of any last-minute negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials, business sources in Washington and Beijing said. Requests for comment went unanswered at the U.S. Treasury, USTR and the U.S. Commerce Department. China accused the United States on Thursday of “opening fire” on the world with tariffs set to take effect on Friday, warning that it will respond the moment that duties on $34 billion in Chinese goods kick in. The dispute has roiled financial markets including stocks, currencies and the global trade of commodities from soybeans to coal in recent weeks. But U.S. stocks edged higher on Thursday, lifted by technology shares, amid hopes that American trade tensions with Europe may ease after German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would back a reduction of European car tariffs if Washington abandons its threatened higher car levies. China has said it will not “fire the first shot” in a trade war with the United States, but its customs agency made clear on Thursday that Chinese tariffs on American goods would take effect immediately after U.S. duties on Chinese goods are put in place. Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said that the proposed U.S. tariffs would hit many American and foreign companies operating in China and disrupt their supplies of components and assembly work.  “U.S. measures are essentially attacking global supply and value chains. To put it simply, the U.S. is opening fire on the entire world, including itself,” Gao said. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials are due to collect 25 percent duties on a range of products including motor vehicles, computer disk drives, parts of pumps, valves and printers and many other industrial components. The list avoids direct tariffs on consumer goods such as cellphones and footwear. But some products, including thermostats, are lumped into intermediate and capital goods categories. China has threatened to respond with tariffs on hundreds of U.S. goods, including top exports such as soybeans, sorghum and cotton, threatening U.S. farmers in states that backed Trump in the 2016 U.S. election, such as Texas and Iowa. Chinese buying of soybeans has already ground nearly to a halt ahead of the duties. In the latest sign that the risk of penalties is hitting trade, a vessel carrying U.S. coal heading for China switched its destination to Singapore. Asked whether U.S. companies would be targeted with “qualitative measures” in China in a trade war, Gao said the government would protect the legal rights of all foreign companies in the country. Gao said China’s foreign trade was expected to continue on a stable path in the second half of the year, though investors fear a full-blown Sino-American trade war would deal a blow to Chinese exports and its economy. Foreign companies accounted for $20 billion, or 59 percent, of the $34 billion of exports from China that would be subject to new U.S. tariffs, with U.S. firms accounting for a significant part of that 59 percent, Gao said. U.S. carmaker Ford Motor Co (F.N) said on Thursday it has no plans to hike retail prices of its imported Ford and Lincoln models in China, despite the steep additional tariffs on imported U.S. vehicles set to come into play on Friday. Ford said it would “continue to monitor the situation as it evolves”. Adding to the tensions, a Chinese court this week temporarily barred Micron Technology Inc (MU.O) from selling its main semiconductor products in the world’s biggest memory chip market, citing violation of patents held by Taiwan’s United Microelectronics Corp (UMC) (2303.TW). Beijing has made the semiconductor sector a key priority under its “Made in China 2025” strategy, which has intensified after a U.S. ban on sales to Chinese phone maker ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) underscored China’s lack of domestic chips.

On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that the United States would begin collecting tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports at 12:01 a.m. Washington time (0401 GMT) on Friday, and warned that subsequent rounds could see tariffs imposed on more than $500 billion worth of goods. “The risk that further escalation derails growth is keeping some investors cautious,” ANZ analysts said in a note Friday. The Sino-U.S. trade dispute has roiled financial markets including stocks, currencies and the global trade of commodities from soybeans to coal over the past several weeks. Overnight gains in European and U.S. equities, however, provided some comfort for the start of Asian trading. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan inched up 0.05 percent, with some support from early gains in Korean and Australian shares. Japan’s Nikkei stock index was 1.1 percent higher after closing at a three-month low on Thursday, while Australian shares gained 0.2 percent. Seoul’s Kospi index edged up 0.2 percent. In Thursday’s Wall Street session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.75 percent, the S&P 500 0.86 percent and the Nasdaq Composite 1.12 percent. U.S. and European shares were boosted by reassuring economic data from Germany, and as automakers’ shares jumped, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel saying she would back lowering European Union tariffs on U.S. car imports after Washington offered to scrap threatened tariffs on European cars. But newly released minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting on June 12-13 showed policymakers discussed whether recession lurked around the corner, and expressed concerns global trade tensions could hit an economy that by most measures looked strong. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 2.8364 percent. The two-year yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 2.5527 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.561 percent. Gold, which is sensitive to rising interest rates, was flat. Spot gold traded at $1257.63 per ounce. The dollar fell slightly against the yen, dropping 0.1 percent to 110.54. The single currency was up a hair on the day at $1.1694, while the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, turned down 0.1 percent to 94.365. Oil prices ticked up after falling on U.S. government data that showed an unexpected jump in crude oil stockpiles. U.S. crude rose 0.2 percent at $73.08 a barrel. Brent crude was also 0.2 percent higher at $77.52 per barrel. Reporting by Andrew Galbraith

2018-07-06,"HOUSTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. energy, agricultural and chemicals companies are girding for a summer standoff over trade as a midnight deadline approaches for Washington to impose the next round of tariffs on a wide range of Chinese goods. Industry lobbying efforts appear to have failed to convince the Trump administration to put off Friday’s 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion worth of mostly tech and manufacturing goods from China. Earlier this year, the United States levied tariffs on steel and aluminum from China and elsewhere.  Lobbying efforts are now focused on convincing President Donald Trump to not put tariffs on a second list of mainly energy, plastics and chemicals worth about $16 billion, said industry officials.  China has vowed to respond to any new tariffs, threatening to further escalate the trade conflict between the world’s two largest economies. The American Petroleum Institute, which represents oil and gas producers, backed a bill that would have Congress vet future tariffs proposed on national security grounds. The bill has stalled in the Senate. “We’ve had meetings with members of Congress to press the issue,” said Lee Fuller, a vice president at oil and gas trade group Independent Petroleum Association of America. It is requesting the administration “look at better alternatives than they have so far.”  The IPAA favors granting more tariff exclusions to products not typically made in the United States, including certain specialty steel used in oil drilling.  China’s list of goods facing retaliatory tariffs include U.S. crude oil, plastics and chemicals, all industries that have rapidly expanded using abundant U.S. shale oil and natural gas to drive exports to China.      “I put millions of dollars into equipment and infrastructure on the basis of exporting a heck of a lot more to China. I’m at risk,” said Marc Levine, chief executive of Plantgistix LLC, a Texas-based plastics resin blender, packager and shipper.   If China goes ahead with tariffs on U.S. plastics, it “could have a very clear negative effect on resin producers and others here to support the huge increase in production - railroads, truckers, pallet manufacturers and ocean carriers,” Levine said.  Chinese retaliatory tariffs on $5.4 billion worth of U.S. chemicals goods “are direct hits” on recent production expansions, said Ed Brzytwa, director of international trade for the American Chemistry Council.  “If those come into effect, we’ll have to close down plants and jobs will be at issue,” he said.  The ACC opposes the Trump administration’s plan to put tariffs on $2.2 billion worth of Chinese plastics, Brzytwa said, saying: “We didn’t ask for that.”    Agriculture lobbyists have resigned themselves to tariffs from China, the largest buyer of U.S. agriculture commodities, following the imposition of tariffs earlier this week by the European Union, Canada and Mexico. “We’re primarily battening down the proverbial hatches ... and hoping the administration will throw that Hail Mary for us,” American Soybean Association spokeswoman Wendy Brannen said.

2018-07-06,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) moved to bring Venezuelan PDVSA’s U.S. refining unit Citgo Petroleum into its legal battles to enforce a $2 billion arbitration award against the South American country’s nationalization of its Venezuelan assets. A U.S. district court judge in Houston on Thursday ruled Conoco can depose Citgo as preparation for a court case against PDVSA and others over alleged asset transfers in the Caribbean that Conoco claims were designed to frustrate its efforts to obtain payment under an International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) award. Citgo declined to comment, citing a policy regarding ongoing litigation. Conoco is pleased with the court’s decision, spokesman Daren Beaudo said in a statement. The company has not received any payment from PDVSA for the award and will continue to pursue the matter, he added. The decision is another blow to the Venezuelan oil company, which has struggled to pay creditors as its oil production has fallen to the lowest level in more than three decades.   Conoco alleges state-run PDVSA transferred crude and fuels stored at the Isla refinery and Bullenbay Terminal in Curacao to Citgo to prevent it from seizing the oil to enforce the ICC award, according to its filing with a U.S. district in Houston. The court filing portrays active and often successful efforts by PDVSA and its subsidiary to defeat Conoco’s bids to seize oil cargoes and other assets. In one case, it claims PDVSA caused Citgo Petroleum to claim ownership of cargoes off Aruba as a way to lift the company’s liens, Conoco said in its June filing.  PDVSA also denied court officers access to some ships docked near Curacao and at least one vessel temporarily disabled its GPS transponder to make a getaway, avoiding seizure, the filing said.  Conoco’s assets in Venezuela were expropriated in 2007, after the late President Hugo Chavez nationalized several oil projects by forcing their conversion into joint ventures controlled by PDVSA. Conoco and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) left Venezuela after they were unable to reach agreements with PDVSA. As part of the arbitration award, Conoco was able to place liens on assets owned or rented in Curacao, Aruba, Bonaire and St. Eustatius, including inventories held at refineries and terminals, and cargoes aboard vessels. But those efforts have been hindered by local groups and courts. A Curacao court provisionally lifted Conoco’s claims on the Isla refinery in May after public utilities and the island’s government petitioned the court, citing their need for the fuels.
