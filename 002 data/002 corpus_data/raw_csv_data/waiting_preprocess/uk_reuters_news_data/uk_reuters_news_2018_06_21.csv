2018-06-21,"VIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC scrambled on Thursday to agree on raising oil output, with Saudi Arabia warning of shortages but Iran holding out against a deal amid the prospect of lower exports due to U.S. sanctions on Tehran. The Saudi and Russian energy ministers said a production increase of about 1 million barrels per day (bpd) or around 1 percent of global supply had become a near-consensus proposal for the group and its allies, but Iran’s assent was vital. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on Friday to decide output policy amid calls from top consumers such as the United States, China and India to cool down oil prices and support the world economy by producing more crude. Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, has so far been the main barrier to a new deal as it said on Tuesday OPEC was unlikely to reach an agreement and should reject pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to pump more oil. Trump imposed fresh sanctions on Tehran in May and market watchers expect Iran’s output to drop by a third by the end of 2018. That means the country has little to gain from a deal to raise OPEC output, unlike arch-rival Saudi Arabia. “I don’t think we can reach agreement,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh told reporters after leaving a joint OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial committee in Vienna while other ministers continued talks. Iranian publication Seda quoted sources as saying Zanganeh told the meeting he would not accept an output increase because doing so would pave the way to an Iranian oil embargo.  Iran is usually not part of the committee, which groups Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait, Algeria and Venezuela. The committee meeting was the last consultation before the OPEC gathering on Friday.  The meeting continued for around two hours after Zanganeh left. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the overwhelming majority recommended raising output by 1 million bpd, gradually and on a pro-rata basis among participants. OPEC and its allies have since last year been participating in a deal to cut output by 1.8 million bpd. The measure has helped rebalance the market in the past 18 months and lifted oil LCOc1 to around $73 per barrel from as low as $27 in 2016. Brent oil prices were down 2 percent LCOc1 on Thursday. But unexpected outages in Venezuela, Libya and Angola have effectively brought supply cuts to around 2.8 million bpd in recent months. Iran’s output is also likely to fall in the second half of this year due to the new U.S. sanctions. Falih said the world could face a supply deficit of up to 1.8 million bpd in the second half of 2018 and that OPEC’s responsibility was to address consumers’ worries. “We want to prevent the shortage and the squeeze that we saw in 2007-2008,” Falih said, referring to a time when oil rallied close to $150 per barrel. He also said the U.S. oil output boom would slow due to pipeline shortages in the next two years. On Wednesday Zanganeh had left the door open for a deal, saying OPEC members that had overdelivered on cuts in recent months should comply with agreed quotas. That would effectively mean a modest boost from producers such as Saudi Arabia that have voluntarily cut more deeply than planned. Falih said the exact mechanics of any increase would be decided among all OPEC members on Friday. OPEC sources have said that if a 1 million bpd output hike were approved, Saudi Arabia would add about 0.25-0.3 million bpd to supply. GRAPHIC: OPEC compliance in May - Reuters Survey - reut.rs/2JRWnw1 Zanganeh told CNN on Wednesday that if OPEC returned to regular compliance, the real supply increase from the group would constitute only around 460,000 bpd.  Falih also said the real increase would be smaller than the nominal gain of 1 million bpd, meaning there was still the possibility for compromise with Iran. OPEC sources also said Iran had demanded that U.S. sanctions be mentioned in the group’s post-meeting communique, as Tehran has blamed U.S. measures for the recent rise in oil prices. The United States, which rivals Russia and Saudi Arabia for the position of world No.1 oil producer, is not participating in the current supply pact.

2018-06-21,"(Adds details from complaint) By Nate Raymond June 21 (Reuters) - A Texas oil and gas businessman who called himself the “Frack Master” has been charged with securities fraud in connection with a scheme that defrauded investors out of $62.6 million, U.S. prosecutors said on Thursday. Christopher Faulkner, 41, was arrested on Monday at the Los Angeles International Airport and charged in a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, prosecutors said. The criminal charges came two years after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Faulkner, a frequent media commentator on oil-and-gas topics, and his Dallas-based Breitling Energy Corp and accused them of fraud. The complaint charged the Dallas resident with securities fraud, mail fraud and money laundering. A lawyer for Faulkner did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to the complaint, from 2009 to 2016, Faulkner established several companies through which he acquired and then sold to investors working and royalty interest in oil and gas prospects in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and North Dakota. That included Breitling, which became a publicly traded company in 2013 through a so-called reverse merger, the complaint said. Prosecutors said that Faulker and his companies made fraudulent misrepresentations to investors by, among other things, hyerinflating the estimated costs of drilling and testing wells. In total, Faulkner raised over $62.6 million from investors, prosecutors said. They said that Faulker diverted a significant amount of that money for his own benefit and to fund a lavish lifestyle that included expensive vehicles, jewelry and chartered flights. The case is U.S. v. Faulkner, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 18-mj-407.

2018-06-21,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Oil and gas drilling gives off far more of the powerful greenhouse gas methane than the U.S. government estimates as leaky wells go unnoticed by federal regulators, scientists said on Thursday. Methane, the main component of natural gas, is colorless and odorless. It is a major force in short-term global warming because it has more than 80 times the heat trapping potential of carbon dioxide in the first 20 years after it escapes into the atmosphere, scientists say. In high concentrations it can also lead to formations of smog, which is linked to heart and lung damage.  The amount of methane leaked from U.S. oil and gas wells and related infrastructure in 2015 equaled about 2.3 percent of the country’s overall natural gas output, a study led by the Environmental Defense Fund advocacy group said. That was much more than the 1.4 percent the Environmental Protection Agency estimated for 2015 in a report last year. About $2 billion in fuel vanishes in the air annually, and some energy companies are expected to cut those losses with the help of improved monitoring equipment in drones and vehicles.  “This is a solvable problem because you are losing product that you could sell,” said Steven Hamburg, the EDF’s chief scientist and a co-author of the study. “But the entire industry has to take action to stop the problem,” he added.  Once leaks are detected, stopping them becomes a matter of routine maintenance that cuts down on well breakdowns, which are more expensive to fix, he said.      The study, integrating five years of research by scientists from 15 universities and institutions, including Stanford, Harvard and Purdue, was the most comprehensive look ever at fugitive methane emissions from U.S. energy development, EDF said. The research, which featured measurements from more than 400 well pads and other infrastructure, was published in the journal Science. While President Donald Trump’s administration has been trying to roll back methane rules on energy operations set under former President Barack Obama, the EPA’s underestimation had nothing to do with politics, said Hamburg.  Still, federal regulations are needed to address the emissions, because voluntary actions by companies are not enough, he said. “The data is saying the problem is worse than we thought, the need for regulation is thus that much greater,” Hamburg said. The EPA likely underestimates the emissions because it seeks permission from oil and gas operators to take measurements and workers may avoid errors or fix problems when measurement teams arrive, the study said. The study relied on both top-down measurements, such as aircraft observations, and bottom-down measurements made directly at, or downwind of energy facilities. An EPA spokeswoman said the agency will review the study. Seth Whitehead, a spokesman for the drilling industry group Energy in Depth, called EDF’s emissions estimate “exaggerated” because it relied on previous studies that did not involve industry consultation.   Most of the emissions come from malfunctioning well pads that are not fixed because the leaks are not detected, the study said. Leaks can be found at both young and mature wells and at fracking and conventional wells. The malfunctioning wells were “largely absent from EPA’s inventory,” Hamburg said.   The study did not consider leaks from local distribution and power plants that burn natural gas or chemical plants that use it to make products. But scientists say those leaks are significant.

A weaker-than-expected U.S. economic indicator also hit confidence. Oil futures settled lower before an OPEC meeting expected to increase the world’s supply of crude. [O/R] The dollar fell from an 11-month high against a basket of major currencies after the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s gauge of U.S. Mid-Atlantic business activity fell to a near 1-1/2 year low. U.S. equity investors sold shares as they got some specific indications on the potential impact of President Donald Trump’s trade tariff stand-off with China. German carmaker Daimler (DAIGn.DE) cut its earnings forecast late on Wednesday, saying tariffs on cars sent from the United States to China would hurt Mercedes-Benz car sales. Also of concern was the U.S. immigration crisis after Trump  backed off an unpopular hardline policy that had led to children being separated from their parents when they crossed illegally into the United States from Mexico. “The headlines seem to be motivating the market. The immigration issue and trade,” said Phil Blancato, chief executive of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York. “It leads to a  lack of confidence in the administration’s ability to push its economic agenda forward.”  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 196.1 points, or 0.8 percent, to 24,461.7, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 17.56 points, or 0.63 percent, to 2,749.76 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 68.56 points, or 0.88 percent, to 7,712.95.

2018-06-21,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is considering delaying its widely anticipated announcement on Friday on 2019 renewable fuel volumes as it re-examines plans to force larger refineries to make up for gallons exempted at smaller plants, according to two sources familiar with the process. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue were set to travel to a farm outside of Kansas City, Missouri, where they were expected to announce a proposal for 2019 renewable fuel requirements on Friday.  The announcement would follow weeks of criticism of Pruitt’s handling of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program from biofuels supporters who accuse him of trying to undermine the program to help the refining industry. The RFS, created in 2005, requires fuel companies to use increasing volumes of renewable fuels like ethanol with their petroleum products each year, but the EPA has used its authority to provide waivers to an unusually large number of small refineries releasing them of their obligation. The EPA and the White House were still hashing out the details of a last-minute plan to appease farmers as part of the annual volumes announcement, the sources said, and the announcement could be postponed if an agreement is not reached.  EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox did not respond to request for comment. USDA did not respond immediately to request for comment. The plan under consideration would force large refiners to blend extra volumes to compensate for the hardship waiver exemptions for small refiners. The idea was met with stiff oil industry opposition on Wednesday, sending the price of compliance credits surging. “This backroom deal would flat out betray consumers, labor and refinery workers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Louisiana and dozens of other states that helped elect this president. To say that we would be livid were this deal to move forward would be a gross understatement,” Chet Thompson, head of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, said. The EPA administers RFS and is permitted under the law to give waivers to refineries under 75,000 barrels-per-day that can prove compliance would cause them financial damage.  Under the RFS, refiners are meant to earn or buy blending credits corresponding with their obligation under the annual volumes mandates and turn them in to the agency. The cost of those credits have been volatile and in recent years have created a burden for refiners amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars.  The EPA is required to set targets for blending volumes by Nov. 30 for the following year, and tends to announce its proposal months in advance of that deadline to gather feedback. As of Thursday morning, the agency was seen as likely to include a plan on how to reallocate waived volumes into this year’s proposal, according to sources.  One of the sources said the White House - which is trying to appease the rival corn and oil industries - was “blindsided” by the idea, triggering the current re-assessment of the plan. Prices of renewable fuel credits traded in a range from 29.5-33 cents as the rumors swirled, said traders. They hit 28 cents on Wednesday, jumping by a nickel from the prior session as expectations of a reallocation mounted.

2018-06-21,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global benchmark Brent crude fell more than 2 percent on Thursday ahead of a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, where producers were expected to boost output to stabilize prices. OPEC, however, was struggling to agree on raising output, with Saudi Arabia warning of supply shortages and price rallies but Iran holding out against a deal at the group’s meeting on Friday. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said he still believes OPEC cannot reach a compromise decision. “I don’t think we can reach agreement,” Zanganeh told reporters. “We firstly need to discuss and decide about the main issue inside OPEC. OPEC’s decision is so important - after it we should coordinate everything with the Russians.” Brent crude LCOc1 fell $1.69 to settle at $73.05 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLv1 for August delivery, the new front month, fell 17 cents to $65.54 a barrel, and was down 68 cents from the July contract’s expiry on Wednesday at $66.22. Front-month WTI surged to trade as much as 71 cents a barrel over the second month CLc1-CLc2, the biggest premium since October 2014.  The rise came as the July contract expired on Wednesday and as stockpiles in Cushing, Oklahoma declined by 2.3 million barrels in the week to June 19, according to data from market intelligence firm Genscape, traders said. Falling stockpiles could alleviate some concerns that surging U.S. production would outstrip demand. OPEC, together with other key producers including Russia, started withholding output in 2017 to prop up prices, but a tightening market has led to calls by consumers for more supplies. Brent reached a 3-1/2-year high above $80 a barrel last month but has fallen steadily in recent weeks as Saudi Arabia, de facto leader of OPEC, warned of supply shortages and price rallies if production remained stable. “We need to release supply to the market,” Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters in Vienna. “How much oil do we need? ... Around 1 million (barrels per day) probably.”  Falih said the oil market had now rebalanced and his aim was to prevent a shortage of crude in future that could squeeze the market. OPEC member Ecuador’s oil minister Carlos Perez said he expects an increase of about 600,000 bpd. Harry Tchilinguirian, head of oil strategy at French bank BNP Paribas, told Reuters Global Oil Forum he expected OPEC and Russia to agree a compromise that would see a small increase in global oil production. “It would seem that an aggregate increase in production for OPEC+ of between 500,000 bpd and 1 million bpd is the range that is being considered,” Tchilinguirian said.

2018-06-21,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - East Libyan forces said on Thursday they had retaken the shuttered oil ports of Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, hours after clashes resumed south of Ras Lanuf during a counter-attack by rival factions. Staff were evacuated from terminals in Libya’s eastern oil crescent and exports were suspended last Thursday when armed opponents of eastern-based military commander Khalifa Haftar stormed the ports and occupied them. The fate of the ports, two of Libya’s largest, is crucial to the partial, fragile recovery of the country’s oil industry. Their closure has led to production losses of up to 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) from a total national output of little over one million bpd.  Two oil storage tanks had been set on fire since the initial attack, causing damage that the National Oil Corporation (NOC) has said will take years to repair. On Thursday, a third storage tank was set alight sending thick black smoke over Ras Lanuf before the fire was extinguished, a firefighter said.   Haftar, who built up his Libyan National Army (LNA) during his three-year campaign to seize the eastern city of Benghazi, is one of the figures vying for power in Libya since the country fragmented following a NATO-backed uprising in 2011.  He has received increased international recognition since seizing the oil crescent ports in 2016 and allowing the National Oil Corp (NOC) to reopen them, despite his rejection of a U.N.-backed government in the capital Tripoli. For the past week the LNA had pounded the area with air strikes as it mobilised to retake the ports, and it continued to target its rivals with air strikes on Thursday as they retreated. LNA spokesman Ahmed al-Mismari said troops had retaken Es Sider by mid-morning.   He said Ras Lanuf - which includes a residential town, an air strip, storage tanks and a refinery alongside the oil terminal - had also been taken by the LNA, as rivals had fled to the west and south into the desert, suffering heavy losses. Military and local sources said clashes had resumed south of Ras Lanuf when the LNA’s opponents counter-attacked, before Mismari asserted that the LNA was again in command of the area by late afternoon.  “The oil crescent is, thanks to God, under full control,” he said, adding later in a press conference that the ports would be handed over the NOC after they had been checked for explosives.  Medical and military sources confirmed 15 dead and 25 wounded among LNA forces. Libya’s national production has been cut to between 600,000 and 700,000 bpd during the oil crescent clashes. Production at AGOCO, an NOC subsidiary based in the east, has fallen from around 250,000 to 180,000 bpd, an oil official said on Thursday, due to power problems and to disruption at Ras Lanuf. But as the LNA advanced on the ports early on Thursday, NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said he was expecting a quick restart. “Libyan production is very low but we are going to resume very soon,” Sanalla told reporters in Vienna. “After a couple of days we will resume, we start our operations hopefully.” The NOC has blamed the attack on the terminals on militias led by Ibrahim Jathran, who blockaded oil crescent ports for several years before losing control of them in 2016. The LNA has said the Benghazi Defence Brigades - a coalition of anti-Haftar fighters that previously tried to advance on Benghazi and seized Ras Lanuf and Es Sider for 10 days in March 2017 - were also involved. Both sides have drawn on mercenaries recruited from southern Libya, Chad and Sudan. Jathran, who is from the oil crescent region, said he attacked the ports last week to “overturn injustice” against local residents by the LNA. The LNA was accused of abuses and mass arrests after using tribal alliances to win the ports. Haftar is the dominant figure in eastern Libya, aligned with a government and parliament based there since 2014. Backed by regional allies including Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, he has controlled Benghazi, which lies northeast of the oil crescent, since late last year.

2018-06-21,"(Environmental Defense Fund corrects worth of wasted methane in first paragraph to $2 billion, not $20 billion, and in fourth paragraph to billions of dollars, not tens of billions of dollars) By Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON, June 21 (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas drilling and related operations give off much more of the powerful greenhouse gas methane than the federal government estimates, wasting about $2 billion of fuel a year, scientists said on Thursday. Methane, the main component of natural gas, is colorless and odorless. It is a major force in short-term global warming because it has more than 80 times the warming potential of carbon dioxide in the first 20 years after it escapes into the atmosphere. In high concentrations it can also lead to formations of smog, which is linked to heart and lung damage. The amount of methane leaked from U.S. oil and gas wells and related infrastructure in 2015 equaled about 2.3 percent of the country’s overall natural gas output, a study led by the Environmental Defense Fund advocacy group said. That was much more than the 1.4 percent the Environmental Protection Agency estimated for 2015 in a report last year. Due to the billions of dollars’ worth of fuel that vanishes in the air, some energy companies are expected to cut down on emissions using better monitoring equipment in drones and vehicles. “This is a solvable problem because you are losing product that you could sell,” said Steven Hamburg, the EDF’s chief scientist and a co-author of the study. “But the entire industry has to take action to stop the problem,” he added. Once leaks are detected, stopping them becomes a matter of routine maintenance that cuts down on well breakdowns, which are more expensive to fix, he said. The study, integrating five years of research by scientists from 15 universities and institutions, including Stanford, Harvard and Purdue, said it was the most comprehensive look ever at fugitive methane emissions from U.S. energy development. The research was published in the journal Science. While President Donald Trump’s administration has been trying to roll back methane rules on energy operations set under former President Barack Obama, the EPA’s underestimation had nothing to do with politics, said Hamburg. Still, federal regulations are needed to address the emissions, because voluntary actions by companies are not enough, he said. “The data is saying the problem is worse than we thought, the need for regulation is thus that much greater,” Hamburg said. The EPA likely underestimates the emissions because it seeks permission from oil and gas operators to take measurements and workers may avoid errors or fix problems when measurement teams arrive, the study said. The study relied on both top-down measurements, such as aircraft observations, and bottom-down measurements made directly at, or downwind of energy facilities. An EPA spokeswoman said the agency will review the study. Most of the emissions come from malfunctioning well pads that are not fixed because the leaks are not detected, the study said. Leaks can be found at both young and mature wells and at fracking and conventional wells. The malfunctioning wells were “largely absent from EPA’s inventory,” Hamburg said. The study did not consider leaks from local distribution and power plants that burn natural gas or chemical plants that use it to make products. But scientists say those leaks are significant.

2018-06-21,"LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal’s parliament approved on Thursday a motion by the centre-right opposition to end a surcharge on petrol, undermining the ruling Socialists as their leftist allies sided with the opposition by abstaining and threatening revenues. If the motion takes effect it could rob the government of hundreds of millions of euros in revenues just as it begins to draft next year’s budget with the aim of continuing to cut the budget deficit. The surcharge represents six cents per liter on petrol and diesel sales. The minority Socialist government’s Communist and Left Bloc allies sided with the opposition by abstaining from the vote in an important signal of their growing irritation with tight budgets by the administration. “[The surcharge] represents hundreds of millions of euros to the state budget but only a few cents per liter out of families’ income as a part of their spending on petrol,” said lawmaker Carlos Cesar, who heads the Socialist bloc in parliament, before the vote.  The motion will now be discussed by parliament in detail before it will go into effect but could still be derailed in subsequent votes. It was not clear when this will take place. The Socialists came to power in 2015 and rely on the Communists and Left Bloc for a majority in parliament.  The leftist allies have put pressure on the Socialists this year to open the purse strings, with the economy growing strongly and the budget deficit having been cut to its lowest level in decades. The Socialists introduced the surcharge on petrol in 2016 when crude prices were low in an effort to raise revenues but crude has subsequently risen, giving the government more income through other taxes on petrol sales. “Nothing now justifies maintaining this tax, if not the fiscal voracity of the Socialist government,” said lawmaker Pedro Mota Soares, who heads the parliament bloc of the rightist CDS-PP. “This is a fiscal grab on tax payers.” Reporting By Sergio Goncalves, writing by Axel Bugge, editing by Andrei Khalip and Alexandra Hudson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/portugal-petrol-tax/update-1-portugal-parliament-rejects-petrol-surcharge-in-blow-to-govt-idUKL8N1TN5S7,21 Jun 2018,"Portugal's parliament approved

The minister, Carlos Pérez, also said he did not expect OPEC and its partners to raise oil output by 1 million barrels per day - a figure mentioned by OPEC sources as a compromise - saying an increase of closer to 600,000 bpd was more likely. “It’s going to be tough,” Pérez told Reuters on Thursday. “OPEC is not the place to discuss political issues or bans, or things like that between governments. My point of view is, that should not be discussed - we’re more for technical or economic issues.” Iran, facing U.S. sanctions on its oil industry and angry that U.S. President Donald Trump has asked OPEC to pump more oil, has said the producer group must include a sanctions debate in the agenda of Friday’s meeting. “They (Iran) have requested that but I don’t think it will go anywhere,” Pérez said. “Political issues need to be discussed between the countries that are affected by those things.” The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia have since January last year been participating in a deal to cut output by 1.8 million bpd. With a supply glut now eradicated, oil ministers from OPEC meet on Friday to discuss putting some of the withheld barrels back on the market, followed by talks with non-OPEC producers on Saturday. A production rise of about 1 million bpd was emerging as a consensus, OPEC sources told Reuters on Thursday, adding that Iran could agree to that under certain conditions. But Pérez said he expected the final amount to be less, and far below the 1.5 million bpd mentioned by Russia. “It will probably be around 600,000 or so,” he said.

2018-06-21,"OSLO (Reuters) - More than 20 nations ranging from Germany, France and Britain to Pacific island states said on Thursday they planned to “lead from the front” in setting new, tougher goals by 2020 to cut greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris climate agreement. They welcomed a decision by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to host a summit in September 2019 to review the fight against global warming since almost 200 governments signed up in 2015 for the Paris accord. “We commit to exploring the possibilities for stepping up our own ambition,” the 23 nations said in a statement, issued by the Marshall Islands in the Pacific, about goals for stepping up action by 2020.  “We call on other countries to join us in expressing their desire to lead from the front.”  The governments also said in a “Declaration for Ambition” that they would encourage long-term strategies for low emissions and new funds and investment in projects to help goals of the Paris Agreement. Signatories were Argentina, Britain, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Denmark, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, Germany, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Rwanda, Saint Lucia, Spain and Sweden, a statement said.  “This declaration shows that countries understand the urgency of climate action and are actively looking into making bigger, bolder commitments,” David Waskow of the World Resources Institute think-tank, wrote in a statement. The Paris climate agreement obliges countries to set new climate goals every five years as part of a goal of phasing out polluting fossil fuels this century. The nations said they would work in the light of a U.N. report by leading climate scientists, due for publication in October, about ways to limit a creeping rise in global average temperatures that is causing heat waves, downpours and droughts. A leaked draft of that report says warming is set to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7°F) above pre-industrial times, the strictest goal under the Paris Agreement, by around 2040 unless governments take “rapid and far-reaching” measures. China, the European Union, India and Russia, the top emitters of greenhouse gases which support the Paris accord, were not among nations signing the declaration. It is preliminary with other nations welcome to sign up. The landmark Paris agreement has been weakened by a decision by President Donald Trump to pull the United States, the number two emitter, out of the accord. Trump doubts mainstream scientific findings that man-made greenhouse gases are the prime cause of warming and wants to promote the coal industry.  By contrast, small island states say that a thaw of ice worldwide will raise sea levels and swamp their nations. “If we do not raise global ambition by 2020, it will be too late for my island nation,” Hilda Heine, President of the Marshall Islands, said in a statement.

2018-06-21,"(Reuters) - PG&E Corp (PCG.N) will record $2.5 billion in pre-tax expenses in the second quarter related to wildfires in California, the electric utility said on Thursday, two weeks after state officials blamed its power lines for sparking the fires. Wall Street analysts said PG&E’s initial estimate for charges related to the fires that killed 46 people last fall was within expectations and not as high as some investors had feared. Shares of California’s biggest utility - which have fallen more than 40 percent since the fires broke in October - climbed 2 percent on Thursday afternoon. PG&E has received some 200 complaints related to the fires on behalf of at least 2,700 plaintiffs, and could be the subject of related investigations, it said in a regulatory filing here Lawmakers have said that Pacific Gas & Electric was considering bankruptcy protection if it faces large penalties because of the wildfires, according to local media reports here PG&E said the total wildfire-related charges it could incur could be greater than $2.5 billion. The utility did not have access to evidence collected by fire department officials, it added. California fire department officials said earlier this month its investigators had found “evidence of alleged violations of state law” by Pacific Gas & Electric. Investors were expecting the San Francisco-based utility company to disclose a much higher liability, Morningstar analyst Travis Miller said, without specifying exact figures. Analysts at Guggenheim Partners and Mizuho Securities estimate that final liabilities could total more than $8 billion. PG&E will not need to raise money at the moment to cover potential charges, Chief Financial Officer Jason Wells said on a conference call with analysts. The utility is reviewing the evidence around the causes of the wildfires, it said, adding that it expects to receive $375 million from insurers in the second quarter ending June 30. The wildfires that swept northern California’s wine country were the deadliest in the state’s history, scorching at least 245,000 acres (99,148 hectares) and incinerating 8,900 homes and other structures.

2018-06-21,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada is discussing changes to a multibillion-dollar fighter jet procurement process that could make it harder for a U.S. company to win the order as trade relations between the neighbors sour, two sources with direct knowledge of the discussions said. Canada is considering whether to penalize companies from countries that have caused it economic damage, the sources said on Wednesday. While a final decision is not expected before next year and the threat could be posturing, the move shows how the Trump administration’s trade disputes are spilling over into other areas. A spokeswoman for federal Procurement Minister Carla Qualtrough - who has overall responsibility for major purchases of military equipment - declined to comment. Sources declined to be identified as the discussions are confidential. Boeing Co’s (BA.N) F-18 Super Hornet and Lockheed Martin Corp’s (LMT.N) F-35 fighter were among the favorites to capture the contract to supply 88 planes, worth between C$15 billion ($11.3 billion) and C$19 billion. Defense sources have long said the Canadian air force would prefer an American-built jet, citing the importance of operating easily with U.S. armed forces. But a change in procurement terms would give more of a chance to European suppliers: Airbus SE (AIR.PA), which makes the Eurofighter; Saab AB (SAABb.ST), which makes the Gripen; and Dassault Aviation (AVMD.PA), which makes the Rafale. Defense sources, however, say the European jets are likely to become obsolete by around 2040, at which point they could no longer incorporate the latest technologies. Canada has been trying unsuccessfully for almost a decade to buy replacements for its aging F-18 fighters, some of which are 40 years old. The former Conservative administration said in 2010 it would buy 65 F-35 jets but later scrapped the decision, triggering years of delays and reviews. Ottawa has already said bids will be evaluated in part by examining whether firms competing for the order have caused any past economic damage to Canada. Officials said at the time this was aimed at Boeing, which last year launched a trade challenge against Canadian planemaker Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO). Government officials are now discussing whether Canada should also consider economic damage caused by governments, a clear reference to worsening relations with Washington, said the sources. “Politically it’s hard to spend billions of dollars on contracts with a country that’s hurting you,” said one of the sources, who asked to remain anonymous given the extreme sensitivity of the situation. However, the sources emphasized that the discussions are at an early stage and Ottawa could eventually decide to drop the proposed language. Canada - which is due to release the exact specifications for the jets next year - has not yet finished work on the clause referring to economic damage caused by a single firm.  U.S. President Donald Trump last month slapped tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, prompting Canada to announce its own retaliatory measures. Trump has also threatened tariffs on Canadian autos, which could badly hurt the economy. Ottawa froze talks with Boeing about the fighter jet contest but after the company’s trade challenge against Bombardier failed, Canadian officials made clear the firm would not be discriminated against if it chose to bid.

2018-06-21,"* (Updates with U.S. prices, adds commentary, changes dateline; previous LONDON) * Global stocks subdued by trade fears * Dollar falls after U.S. data * Oil investors wary before OPEC meeting By Sinéad Carew NEW YORK, June 21 (Reuters) - Stocks around the world fell on Thursday and the U.S. dollar slipped from a peak as investors flocked to bonds after weak economic data and on worries about a U.S.-China trade war. Oil futures were lower before an OPEC meeting expected to increase the world’s supply of crude and after a report of a large stockpile draw in the United States. The dollar fell from an 11-month high against a basket of major currencies as the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s gauge of U.S. Mid-Atlantic business activity fell to a near 1-1/2 year low. U.S. equity investors made cautious bets on Thursday after European automakers’ statements about the negative impact of international trade tension. “We’re being held hostage to the trade tariff story. It’s clouding the view of economic growth,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. “It’s a flight to safety move. Yields are lower, and the leading sectors are staples, utilities and telecom. Today is more of a ‘risk-off’ type session,” he said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 163.9 points, or 0.66 percent, to 24,493.9, the S&P 500 lost 13.5 points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,753.82 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 41.94 points, or 0.54 percent, to 7,739.58. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.91 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.53 percent. However, Argentina’s main stock index rose 7.6 percent, putting it on track for its biggest one-day percentage gain since August 2017. Index provider MSCI said late Wednesday it would reclassify Argentina and Saudi Arabia as emerging market countries next year, broadening the investor base for both countries. Saudi Arabia’s MSCI index rose 0.5 percent. In U.S. Treasuries, benchmark 10-year notes last rose 5/32 in price to yield 2.9095 percent, from 2.928 percent late Wednesday. The 30-year bond last rose 7/32 in price to yield 3.0528 percent, from 3.064 percent late Wednesday. This was partly due to the ongoing U.S.-China trade battle, which triggered German carmaker Daimler to cut its earnings forecast. “The trade war is still a factor,” said Jim Vogel, interest rates strategist at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee. “There was an awful lot of buying of Treasuries overnight as people watched both Daimler and Italy.” Italian stocks and bonds also suffered as two euroskeptics were given key parliamentary finance roles by the country’s new coalition government.. The dollar index fell 0.19 percent, with the euro up 0.29 percent to $1.1604. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.30 percent versus the greenback at 110.06 per dollar. Sterling was last trading at $1.3248, up 0.58 percent on the day after the Bank of England’s chief economist unexpectedly joined a minority of the Bank’s policymakers calling for an interest rate hike at its latest meeting. Oil prices fell a day ahead of a meeting of producers in Vienna, where Saudi Arabia is trying to convince fellow Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries members of the need to pump more oil, according to sources familiar with the talks. U.S. crude was last down 0.14 percent at $65.62 per barrel and Brent was last at $73.64, down 1.47 percent. Asian trading was mixed. Japan’s Nikkei added 0.6 percent and Australia’s main index had another strong day before the end of its financial year next week. But China’s Shanghai composite index finished 1.4 percent lower. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares ended down 0.7 percent.

2018-06-21,"* RBCT improves efficiency and coal turnaround time * $98 million machinery replacement project completed * Terminal on track meet record 77 mln tonne export target By Tanisha Heiberg RICHARDS BAY, South Africa, June 21 (Reuters) - South Africa’s Richards Bay Coal Terminal (RBCT) has boosted productivity and improved turnaround times after a 1.34 billion rand ($98 million) machinery upgrade, the firm said on Thursday, as it reiterated forecasts for record exports this year. RBCT, Africa’s largest coal export facility, launched the project to replace its ageing machines with the aim of sustaining the terminal’s 91 million tonne capacity, but the process has also increased efficiencies, it said. “We are already enjoying several operational efficiencies of the new machines,” said RBCT Chief Executive Officer Alan Waller. The project installed two new rail-mounted stacker reclaimers, which scoop up and transfer coal into and out of the yard and its rail-mounted shiploaders. They in turn transport coal along a conveyer into a ship’s hold. The two new reclaimers are expected to have a capacity of 6,000 tonnes per hour compared to the previous machines’ 4,500 tonnes per hour, while the shiploader will have 10,000 tonnes per hour capacity compared with 8,000 tonnes per hour previously. The reclaimers have also cut the amount of bulldozing needed after its coal-carrying arm was extended further into the coal yard from 40 metres to 60 metres, said RBCT project general manager Bill Murphy. “That means it has a longer reach and there is less bulldozing time. It increases the productivity at RBCT,” said Murphy. The project also reconfigured the terminal’s five existing electrical substations and added a new substation. RBCT said it is well on track to reach its export target of 77 million tonnes this year and has already surpassed the levels it had reached last year this time. “We are probably 1 million tonnes ahead compared to this time last year,” said Waller, without giving specific figures.

2018-06-21,"PRISTINA, June 21 (Reuters) - U.S.-based power generator ContourGlobal said it has launched a tender to build a 500-megawatt (MW) coal-fired power plant in Kosovo, expected to cost around 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion). It will be the biggest energy investment in nearly three decades in a country struggling with power shortages. Around 90 percent of its electricity is produced in two ailing coal-fired plants, among Europe’s worst polluters. “The process of selection is a two-stage international competitive tender following applicable World Bank Procurement Guidelines,” ContourGlobal said in a statement e-mailed to Reuters. “It consists of an initial selection process followed by requests for proposals,” it said, adding the deadline for applications for initial selection is August 2. The Word Bank said last week it still has not decided whether to support the project. The Kosovo government had asked the lender earlier to provide partial risk guarantees for the project that would enable cheaper loans for construction. Kosovo has more than 14 billion tonnes of proven lignite reserves, the fifth largest in the world. If the World Bank does not give its support, it remains unclear how the project will proceed. The government earlier said the project was expected to help Kosovo’s economic growth rise to 5 or 6 percent in the coming years, from 3.7 percent in 2017. Environmentalists have complained the plant could lock Kosovo into a future powered by lignite – the dirtiest form of coal. But ContourGlobal said the new plant will improve air quality by reducing the emissions from the two plants that are polluting the area, one of which will close. “Dust emissions will be reduced by 93 percent, while sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides will be reduced by 84 percent and 93 percent respectively, with carbon dioxide being cut by 37 percent,” ContourGlobal said. The company also said that it hopes to secure an equity partner by the end of the year or early in 2019.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other oil producers are meeting in Vienna this week to discuss a possible increase in production, after reducing their output by 1.8 million bpd since January 2017. As part of Russia’s commitment to the deal, Lukoil cut output by 45,000 bpd. Lukoil CEO Vagit Alekperov said the company hoped for the easing of production curbs, which helped cut a global supply glut and boosted oil prices that had slumped below $30 a barrel in 2016. Brent crude is now trading around $73. “I think that the price of oil will be between $70 and $75 per barrel until the end of the year,” Alekperov said. “We are counting on that.” Lukoil could raise output by 23,000 bpd if OPEC and its allies agreed to gradually restore output, Lukoil First Deputy President Alexander Matytsyn said. The company was producing 1.8 million bpd in first quarter of 2018. Lukoil aims to boost its share price with a buyback programme over five years worth $3 billion, set to start in the second half of 2018. Its shares rose 0.4 percent on Thursday. Matytsyn said 100 million treasury shares could be redeemed by the end of 2018. That would leave the company holding 40 million treasury shares, which it said would be used in an incentive programme. Lukoil said it would add another 50,000 bpd in capacity at Iraq’s West Qurna-2 field by the end of 2019 to reach production of 450,000 bpd, Alekperov said. Regarding projects in Mexico, Alekperov said the Russian firm was working on a deal with its Italian partner Eni on three or four blocks “to share risks in terms of geology, finances and infrastructure.” “We agreed in principle, now the details are being discussed,” he said. He did not elaborate. Eni and Lukoil won offshore exploration and production licences in the Cuenca Salina basin in Mexico in March. Eni will have 75 percent in a joint venture that holds the operating licence, while Lukoil would have the remaining 25 percent. The Russian firm is considering swapping licences in Mexico with Eni.

2018-06-21,"(Reuters) - As pipelines out of the largest U.S. oil field reach capacity in the coming months, further depressing West Texas crude prices, smaller producers will have to slow or shut-in production, according to oil executives. Soaring production in U.S. shale fields has driven output to a record 10.47 million barrels per day (bpd) this year and any cutbacks would hurt companies recovering from 2014’s crude-price drop.  Oil in Midland, Texas now sells for about $6 a barrel less than the U.S. benchmark CLc1, compared with $1.50 less in January. It was $13 under the U.S. benchmark in May. Halcon Resources Corp (HK.N) this week said it would remove a drilling rig in the Permian Basin next month because of “lower near-term realized oil prices in the Midland market,” referring to the regional price.  Operators who lack guaranteed space on existing pipelines to the U.S. Gulf Coast would be forced to curtail production if the Midland price falls $10 to $47, said Steven Pruett, chief executive of Midland producer Elevation Resources. “People aren’t going to be excited about running rigs if they can’t move their crude oil,” said Pruett. Pipelines could begin rejecting new crude customers as early as next quarter, said Ryan Smith, director of research at consultancy East Daley Capital.  The Permian now produces about 3.27 million bpd. Takeaway capacity reached 3.3 million bpd in June, according to Genscape.  Scott Sheffield, CEO of shale producer Pioneer Natural Resources Co (PXD.N), said this week that overall Permian output could flatten in the 12-month period ending September 2019, when proposed pipelines are completed. “A lot of independents will have to actually shut in production in the Permian to make room for our growth,” Sheffield said, referring to Pioneer and other companies with guaranteed pipeline space.   The number of active drilling rigs in the Permian last week fell by four to 476, and another measure of activity - well completions - fell to 190 last week from 192, according to researcher Primary Vision. “We think the number of completions in the basin does need to come down,” said Colin Davies, an analyst at Bernstein.  Discovery Operating, a small oil company in Midland, currently plans to send a drilling rig into the Midland Basin, but if regional oil prices fall below $55 a barrel, the company will put the move on hold, said Jeff Sparks, Discovery’s chief operating officer.   “If we’re in the middle of drilling, we might end up with some uncompleted wells,” he said.

2018-06-21,"HANOI (Reuters) - Police in Vietnam arrested four executives of state oil firm PetroVietnam’s subsidiaries on suspicion of embezzlement on Thursday as the communist-led government widens a crackdown on corruption. Dinh Van Ngoc, deputy chief executive officer of Nghi Son Refinery and Petrochemical LLC, and three others were accused of “abusing power to appropriate property”, the Ministry of Public Security said in a statement. Ngoc was arrested for alleged wrongdoing committed when he previously served as general director of Binh Son Refining and Petrochemical, according to the statement. Police also arrested Tu Thanh Nghia, former chief executive officer of Vietsovpetro, an oil joint venture between PetroVietnam and Russia’s Zarubezhneft.  The others arrested were Vo Quang Huy, former chief accountant of Vietsovpetro, and Nguyen Tuan Hung, head of the finance department of PetroVietnam’s leading production and exploration arm PVEP, the statement said. The Ministry of Public Security said it is carrying out further investigation into the case. Calls to PetroVietnam seeking comment went unanswered. Thursday’s arrests come amid a corruption crackdown in Vietnam that has seen several senior government officials and executives of state-owned enterprises arrested and jailed. According to Vietnam’s penal code, anyone found guilty of abusing power to appropriate property may face life in prison. Earlier this year, Vietnam jailed former Politburo member Dinh La Thang for 31 years for financial irregularities at PetroVietnam, formally known as Vietnam Oil and Gas Group.  Thang, 57, who denied any wrongdoing at his trial, was the highest-level politician to have been jailed in Vietnam for decades. Last month, police arrested the chairman and chief accountant of Binh Son Refining and Petrochemical, also accused of embezzlement.  Binh Son, owned by PetroVietnam, operates the country’s first oil refinery, the 130,000-barrel-a-day Dung Quat plant.  Nghi Son Refinery and Petrochemical LLC, which owns the $9 billion (£6.8 billion) Nghi Son refinery, is 35.1 percent owned by Japan’s Idemitsu Kosan Co, 35.1 percent by Kuwait Petroleum (IPO-KUWP.KW), 25.1 percent by state-run PetroVietnam and 4.7 percent by Mitsui Chemicals Inc.

2018-06-21,"VIENNA (Reuters) - While the U.N. atomic watchdog’s inspectors travel the globe to check that countries are not secretly developing nuclear weapons, that work hinges on meticulous analysis by two laboratories nestled in the Austrian countryside. Samples taken in countries including Iran, where the International Atomic Energy Agency is policing the country’s nuclear deal with major powers, are sent to the IAEA’s labs in Seibersdorf near Vienna. There, state-of-the-art equipment scours them for minute traces of uranium and other chemicals. On their visits, inspectors swipe surfaces to check for those telltale particles. They also take samples of chemicals produced and stored at declared facilities. The IAEA then checks that what it has found matches what the country has said it is doing. “If you are for example in your kitchen and you cook something, you will always splatter something around like particles from an aerosol,” said Stephan Vogt, head of the IAEA’s Environmental Sample Laboratory, describing how nuclear work leaves telltale particles behind. “Afterwards you clean but you will never be able to clean 100 percent. There will always be a little bit of material sticking to the surfaces and if someone else comes later on and takes a sample they can tell you what you had for dinner,” said Vogt, whose lab analyses the cloth squares swiped on surfaces. His lab’s equipment includes powerful mass spectrometers, which break down particles to determine the precise level to which uranium has been enriched or their specific isotope. “We’re here to basically serve as an auditor, independently verifying states’ declarations,” said Steve Balsley, head of the Nuclear Material Laboratory, which analyses uranium and plutonium samples from declared nuclear sites.  None of the samples come in with their geographical origin specified, ensuring that the scientists’ analysis is completely unbiased. The labs are also part of a broader network, with facilities in member states performing their own analyses and double-checking duplicate samples. “Laboratory experts need to confirm that the uranium and plutonium content in the samples matches what a state has declared to the agency,” Balsley told reporters touring his lab.

2018-06-21,"DAR ES SALAAM, June 21 (Reuters) - The World Bank has approved a $455 million loan to Tanzania under its International Development Assistance (IDA) programme to support financing of power projects in the East African nation. The financing from IDA, which gives grants or low-interest loans to the world’s poorest countries, will also fund construction of high voltage transmission infrastructure to connect Tanzania to regional power markets in southern and eastern Africa. “The $455 million credit will finance construction of critical high voltage transmission infrastructure that will support the electrification of the southern and northwestern regions of Tanzania,” the World Bank said in a statement on Thursday. The government said it plans to raise 2 trillion Tanzanian shillings ($880 million) in its budget for fiscal year 2018/19 (July-June) from concessional loans and grants to finance development projects. Tanzania boasts reserves of over 57 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of natural gas, but faces periodic power shortages as it relies on hydro-power dams in a drought-prone region. Last year President John Magufuli said the country needed to invest $46.2 billion over the next 20 years to revamp its ageing energy infrastructure and meet soaring electricity demand. Investors have long complained that the lack of reliable power hurts business there. Tanzania plans to boost power generation capacity from around 1,500 MW currently to 5,000 MW over the next three years by building new gas-fired and hydroelectric plants, according to the country’s energy ministry.

2018-06-21,"* Most shares subdued, await news on trade * Growing talk of China stimulus underpins sentiment * Dollar index hits 11-month top, yen eases * Oil wary before OPEC meeting on risk of expanded supply * Italian markets knocked by eurosceptic appointment By Marc Jones LONDON, June 21 (Reuters) - Simmering trade and political tensions and a pumped-up dollar weighed on world shares on Thursday, while oil prices were under pressure before an OPEC meeting expected to increase the world’s supply of crude. Europe’s main stock markets were back near two-month lows and Wall Street’s S&P 500 and Dow Jones started lower, as the jitters that have dominated markets for months overshadowed a new record high for the Nasdaq. A whip-sawing dollar also caused confusion. It had roared to an 11-month peak during European trading only to fall back in opening U.S. deals despite another drop in jobless claims figures. Europe’s big move was a 3 percent drop in car shares to nine-month lows, after Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler warned the global trade tensions were slowing its sales. Italian stocks and bonds also suffered as two eurosceptics were given key parliamentary finance roles by the country’s new coalition government.. “The reaction of the dollar has been very interesting this week,” said State Street Global Markets head of macro strategy Michael Metcalfe. “In previous periods this year, fears of a trade war have been dollar-negative, but that has been different this week ... we have had this potential escalation in the trade war, and it has rallied.” Asia had been mixed, too, with Japan’s Nikkei adding 0.6 percent and Australia’s main index enjoying another strong day before the end of its financial year next week. China however finished more than 1 percent lower and at 2 year closing lows due to the trade strains . MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares ended down too have been 0.5 percent higher at one point. Gyrations were compounded by the dollar’s surge to an 11-month high. That raises inflation outside the U.S. and puts pressure on any country or company that has gorged itself on dollar-denominated debt. The mere absence of new trade threats from U.S President Donald Trump on tariffs was nevertheless enough to keep hopes alive that all the bluster was a ploy which would stop short of an outright trade war. Markets had also been encouraged by the People’s Bank of China’s move to set firm fixings for its yuan, along with the addition of extra liquidity, though the spot yuan rate did hit a fresh five-month low. There was also much speculation the central bank would cut bank reserve requirements, thus boosting lending power in the economy. Wall Street was clearly still harbouring worries about trade as it opened. The 30-member Dow Jones which includes Caterpillar and Boeing both with big Chinese revenues, will rack up an eighth straight session of losses if it ends in the red. And even though there was nothing directly from Trump, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross did give a CNBC interview. “What we have to do is create an environment where it’s more painful for these parties that have these huge trade barriers,” Ross said. The dollar’s swings made for a busy day for currency markets. It hopped between 110.76 and 110.20 yen, hit an 11-month high against a basket of top currencies before losing steam and briefly sent the euro below $1.15 again. Sterling had hit a seven-month low only to jump back up to $1.32 after the Bank of England’s chief economist unexpectedly joined a minority of the Bank’s policymakers calling for an interest rate hike at its latest meeting. It wasn’t enough to stop the BoE keeping everything on hold but it did revive talk of an August rate rise. While the European Central Bank has signalled an end to bond-buying, it has pledged to keep euro zone rates low past next summer, and the Bank of Japan shows no sign of unwinding its stimulus. Switzerland’s central bank kept its rates deep in negative territory on Thursday and warned that risks to the economy were rising amid all the trade war noise. “It feels like the yellow warning lights are flashing for the global economic system,” noted analysts at Citi. “However, with the ECB and BoJ still pumping in liquidity and keeping rates lower for longer, the chances of a systemic event are low.” That low-risk market mood nudged gold to a six-month low. Oil was also on the slide ahead of Friday’s meeting of producers in Vienna, where Saudi Arabia is trying to convince fellow OPEC members of the need to pump more oil, according to sources familiar with the talks. “We need to release supply to the market,” Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters. Iran on Thursday also signalled it could be won over to a small rise in output, potentially paving the way for a deal. Benchmark Brent crude fell $1.56 a barrel to a low of $73.18 before recovering slightly to $73.34, down $1.40, by 0850 GMT. U.S. light crude was $1.00 lower at $64.71. “It would seem that an aggregate increase in production for OPEC+ of between 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) and 1 million bpd is the range that is being considered,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of oil strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

2018-06-21,"(Adds latest information) VIENNA, June 21 (Reuters) - For OPEC, over-compliance with its oil supply-cutting deal is a nice problem to have. Once known for rampant cheating on agreed oil output targets, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has been over-delivering on a pact in place since January 2017, cutting around one and a half times the promised amount. The producer group meets on Friday to decide on output policy amid calls from major consumers such as the United States, India and China to cool down oil prices by producing more crude. OPEC and non-members including Russia have been participating since Jan. 1 last year in a deal to cut output by 1.8 million bpd. The arrangement runs to the end of 2018. OPEC ministers meet their non-OPEC counterparts on Saturday. In practice, the cut has approached 2.8 million bpd, delegates and ministers say, because of involuntary declines in countries including Venezuela and Angola, as well as voluntary reductions by Saudi Arabia. Iran has so far been the main barrier to a new pact, objecting to U.S. calls for increased output. But OPEC officials are increasingly confident a deal will be reached. Sources said a production rise of about 1 million bpd was emerging as a possible consensus for OPEC and its allies, adding that Iran could assent under certain conditions. Since an increase of 1 million bpd would shrink the cut to about 1.8 million bpd from 2.8 million bpd, it could provide a compromise by keeping the existing deal while raising output. A key challenge is how to share out the 1 million bpd, or whatever increase is eventually agreed. Below are some of the sums being considered by OPEC and its allies: * If all OPEC members produced as much as they were allowed under the current deal, OPEC output would in theory rise by about 740,000 bpd, based on Reuters estimates of the group’s production in May. * But in practice it would mean a boost of less than a 10th of that amount, effectively from Saudi Arabia. Riyadh is considered the only OPEC member pumping below-target that could add significantly more at short notice. * The current ratio of agreed OPEC cuts versus agreed non-OPEC cuts is around 65 percent versus 35 percent. * That means if a 1 million bpd output rise were agreed, OPEC would be allowed to increase output by around 650,000 bpd, of which Saudi Arabia could contribute over 200,000 bpd. * However, questions remain over Venezuela, Libya and Angola, whose declines cannot be reversed at short notice. * OPEC could distribute the increase unevenly to allow those that can produce more - Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates - to fill in for those that cannot, although this could face resistance from countries reluctant to give up market share such as Iran. * Iran has signalled that it would oppose any Saudi move to fill other producers’ supply gaps. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday that an OPEC output increase could total around 460,000 bpd. * OPEC’s secretariat is looking at new quotas under various scenarios, OPEC sources said. * If the existing deal were retained and the Saudis felt a need to add more oil, Riyadh could increase output unilaterally, as it did after a meeting in June 2011 ended with no decision.

2018-06-21,"* Cost of service study underway * Canada’s First Quantum welcomes study (Adds first Quantum Minerals comment) By Chris Mfula LUSAKA, June 21 (Reuters) - Zambia plans to introduce electricity tariffs that reflect the cost of production by the end of this year, a senior government official said on Thursday, a move that could increase costs for economically vital mining firms that currently pay a flat price. In 2015 and 2016, Zambia experienced a critical shortage of electricity of up to 600 megawatts due poor rainfall in a country that relies heavily on hydropower, putting pressure on the government to apply tariffs that reflect costs to raise cash for investment in other energy sources to buoy power supply. The new measure will affect global mining firms including First Quantum Minerals, Glencore, Barrick Gold Corp and Vedanta Resources which currently pay a flat tariff of 9.30 U.S. cents/kilowatt hour (kWh). The mining industry brings in around 70 percent of Zambia’s foreign exchange. The permanent secretary for energy, Emelda Chola, said in a statement at a mining and energy conference that the government had implemented the first phase of the migration by raising the price of electricity last year. She said members of the regional Southern African Development Community (SADC) - to which Zambia belongs - had agreed to migrate to cost-related tariffs by the end of 2019. “In addition, Zambia has launched an industry-wide cost of service study, which will determine subsequent tariff adjustments to be made,” Chola said. First Quantum welcomed the study, saying cost-related tariffs would help attract foreign investment into the power sector, which would be good news as electricity is one of the mining sector’s largest costs. “It has to be underpinned by an effective and efficient power utility,” First Quantum Head of Government Relations John Gladston told Reuters, referring to the cost of service study. Mining companies have previously said the cost of electricity in Zambia is much higher than it should be because of inefficiencies at state power company Zesco Ltd. Chola said Zambia planned to attract private sector investment in renewable energy with a target of developing a total capacity of 200 megawatts (MW) of electricity over a three year period.

2018-06-21,"LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission is investigating the bloc’s biggest sea-borne gas supplier Qatar Petroleum over potentially restrictive 20-year supply agreements inhibiting development of a single gas market, its latest challenge to a major gas supplier.  The bloc, having just wrapped up a seven-year market abuse probe into Russian giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM), said it sought to determine if Qatar’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply deals with European utilities barred them from diverting shipments within the region.  So-called destination clauses are a fixture of long-term LNG deals that tie buyers to receiving shipments at a specific port, thereby preventing cargo diversions that could undercut Qatar in a third market. Qatar is the world’s biggest LNG producer and its geographical location between Europe and Asia also allows it to swing supply to the most lucrative market, which causes periodic supply shortages particularly in northwest Europe.  Roughly speaking, Qatar offers two types of LNG supply arrangements in Europe. The classic long-term deal prevalent across southern Europe forces the buyer to take or pay for a fixed annual quantity of LNG even if they do not need it. In such cases, diversion curbs may limit the benefit to Europe given that Italy’s Edison, for example, couldn’t freely send emergency supplies of Qatari LNG to plug potential shortfalls in southern France.  The second contract type confined to northwest Europe leaves it largely up to Qatar as to how much LNG arrives at port.  The world’s biggest LNG importer Japan has led the backlash against destination curbs in LNG deals, a throwback to a time when producers held the upper hand, after its Fair Trade Commission last year banned the practice in any new deals.  The probe into Qatar’s LNG deals follows extensive consultation between the European Commission and Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in recent months exploring the impact of such curbs on gas market development and price transparency, workshop presentations seen by Reuters show.  “We have opened an investigation to look at whether there are problematic territorial restriction clauses in gas supply contracts with Qatar Petroleum,” Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said in a statement.  “Such clauses may harm competition and prevent consumers from enjoying the benefits of an integrated European energy market,” she said.  In a statement, Qatar Petroleum said the investigation will focus on five of its LNG subsidiaries operated by Qatargas. “Qatar Petroleum wishes to stress that it gives the highest importance to compliance with regulatory authorities in all geographical areas in which it operates,” it said.  Trevor Sikorski, analyst at Energy Aspects, said the producer could face fines of up to 10 percent of global turnover if found guilty of non-competitive behaviour.  “The more likely outcome is they agree to remove all restrictive destination clauses in their supply agreements with European buyers,” he said.  EU anti-trust regulators ultimately decided against fining Gazprom after finishing the seven-year probe in May, but it did force Gazprom to reform its pricing structure and allow buyers in eastern and central Europe greater control over supply. Under EU rules, destination restrictions hold no sway once pipeline gas or LNG shipments arrive at European ports.  While this has liberated piped gas flows across the region, LNG is more cumbersome to re-export from one port to another, heightening market divisions. Qatar supplied 43 percent of the EU’s LNG last year at 16.81 million tonnes compared to 38.65 million tonnes in total, according to data from the International Group of LNG Importers.  Nigeria and Algeria were the next biggest suppliers with just over 7 million tonnes.

2018-06-21,"* Germany, France, Britain among nations exploring tougher goals * Welcome U.N. plan for summit in 2019 to review climate action By Alister Doyle OSLO, June 21 (Reuters) - More than 20 nations ranging from Germany, France and Britain to Pacific island states said on Thursday they would try to limit their greenhouse gas emissions more than already planned under the Paris climate agreement by 2020. They welcomed a decision by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to host a summit in September 2019 to review the fight against global warming since almost 200 governments signed up in 2015 for the Paris climate agreement. “We commit to exploring the possibilities for stepping up our own ambition,” the 23 nations said in a statement, issued by the Marshall Islands in the Pacific, about goals for action by 2020. “We call on other countries to join us in expressing their desire to lead from the front.” The governments also said they would encourage long-term strategies for low emissions and new funds and investment in projects to help goals of the Paris Agreement. Signatories were Argentina, Britain, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Denmark, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, Germany, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Rwanda, Saint Lucia, Spain and Sweden, a statement said. Their “Declaration for Ambition” underscores commitment to the principles of the Paris climate agreement, which also seeks ever tougher climate goals to phase out polluting fossil fuels this century. The nations said they would work in the light of a U.N. report by leading climate scientists, due for publication in October, about ways to limit a creeping rise in global average temperatures that is causing heat waves, downpours and droughts. A leaked draft of that report says warming is set to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7°F) above pre-industrial times, the strictest goal under the Paris Agreement, by around 2040 unless governments take “rapid and far-reaching” measures. The world’s biggest producer of greenhouse gases, China, is not among the nations pledging faster action, but the declaration is preliminary with other nations welcome to sign up. Beijing remains a signatory of the Paris accord. The landmark agreement has been weakened by a decision by President Donald Trump to pull the United States, the number two emitter, out of the accord. Trump doubts mainstream scientific findings that man-made greenhouse gases are the prime cause of warming and wants to promote the coal industry. By contrast, small island states say that a thaw of ice worldwide will raise sea levels and swamp their nations. “If we do not raise global ambition by 2020, it will be too late for my island nation,” Hilda Heine, President of the Marshall Islands, said in a statement.

2018-06-21,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2M6MCGP By John Kemp LONDON, June 21 (Reuters) - Oil traders’ attention is focused this week on Vienna, where ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies must decide whether to increase their output in the second half of 2018. But the direction of prices over the next year will be more influenced by less visible developments in the major oil-consuming countries, especially the United States, Europe, China and India. With available production capacity fairly fixed in the short-term, oil market rebalancing will depend on consumer reactions to higher prices (tmsnrt.rs/2M6MCGP). Stocks of crude oil and refined products are now below their five-year averages and expected to continue falling in the second half of 2018 and through 2019. OPEC’s spare production capacity has shrunk to less than 2 million barrels per day (bpd) and is expected to fall to less than 1 million bpd by the end of 2019. OPEC and its allies are discussing an output increase of 1 million bpd or more to avert future shortages and stock declines. By adding barrels to the market now, OPEC can stabilise or even increase inventories and ease shortages later in 2018/19. But the cushion of spare capacity is already low and will shrink further as OPEC boosts its output, leaving the market without much capacity to absorb further disruptions. U.S. oil production is expected to rise by 1.4 million bpd in 2018 and another 1.1 million bpd in 2019 but may not be able to rise much faster because of pipeline bottlenecks. From the supply side, therefore, the oil market’s production capability now appears fairly fixed for the rest of 2018 and into 2019. Any further rebalancing will have to come from the demand side, where prices will have to rise high enough to moderate consumption growth. Global consumption has increased by an average of 1.7 million bpd for the last three years, accelerating from an average of 1.1 million bpd in the three previous years. Slower growth in consumption will almost certainly have to play a significant role in pushing the oil market back towards balance. Benchmark oil prices have already risen by around 70 percent over the last year, which should help restrain consumption growth. The critical question is whether the rise in prices has already been enough to promote a slowdown, or whether prices will have to rise even further. The problem for traders and ministers trying to estimate the price needed to rebalance the market is that consumption responds to price changes with a delay of six to 18 months. And in most important consuming countries, reliable statistics on consumption are available only with a delay of three to four months. A sharp rise in prices almost always leads to a slowdown in consumption growth, especially in the advanced economies, but the slowdown is always more apparent in retrospect than at the time. By the time a slowdown shows up in official statistics, it will already be too late, and prices will probably have risen too high to be sustainable. In 2006-2008 and again in 2011-2014, surging oil prices resulted in a sharp slowdown in consumption growth in the advanced economies, though at the time many analysts dismissed signs of a slowdown. In both cases, the oil market was eventually forced back to balance, but not before prices had overshot on the upside, creating conditions for the subsequent collapse.

2018-06-21,"VIENNA (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions on Venezuela are an attack against the stability of the global oil market, Venezuelan Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo said on Thursday.  Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and state-run oil firm PDVSA ] face an export crisis due to declining crude output, a lack of cash for spare parts and equipment, and a loss of employees fleeing due to hyperinflation and severe recession. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has been increasing sanctions on various Venezuelan nationals and companies, part of a campaign to pressure socialist President Nicolas Maduro to make political and market reforms. The sanctions “are a direct attack against the stability of the oil market”, Quevedo said in a speech at an OPEC seminar in Vienna, describing what he called an “unconventional war with the world’s largest oil consumer”, the United States.  “Venezuela’s situation should not be ignored. Venezuela could be any of your countries,” Quevedo told his fellow OPEC ministers. The country is pumping about 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil, Quevedo said earlier.

2018-06-21,"VIENNA, June 21 (Reuters) - Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Thursday increasing oil supply by 1 million barrels per day would be a good target as the Organization of the Oil Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia meet in Vienna this week. Below are highlights from Falih’s speech at an OPEC seminar: “What strikes me most is the great alignment, the very strong alignment between the interests of producers and consumers and many people underestimate how much alignment of interests there is between producers and consumers of petroleum.” “We’ve seen investments start flowing back, certainly it’s flowing back in the (United States) with short-cycle oil, the shale. We still want more investment. My concern is really to be able to look forward in terms of five to 15 years in the future and see enough long-cycle projects coming back in.” “We want to prevent the shortage and the squeeze that we saw in 2007-2008, we saw it again a few years ago as a result of lack of investment. But at the same time we want to prevent the severe downturns that choke the industry, cause bankruptcies, jobs being lost across the world.” “Our OPEC secretariat will share with us today in the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee their report. I’ve looked at the report flying in and I think it shows that there will be a deficit in the second half of this year of 1.6 – 1.8 million barrels assuming that the main production continues. That will continue to drive inventories down. We think that that will be probably too short of a supply situation, we cannot allow it to happen. So what level of supply release – we will have to come to a consensus.” “At the end of the day our first and foremost responsibility is to our consumers and to our market.” “How much do we distribute amongst the countries and how much of it actually is delivered I think is the debate in the next couple of days.” “One thing you can be assured of is we will be responsible, we will release supplies to make sure that no shortage materialises.” “Coming close or even below the 1.8 million cut is called for by the fundamentals. How to achieve it is the tricky question because not every country can respond to an allocation for a higher production target.” “Reallocating (output) to other countries like Saudi Arabia may be a technical solution but it may not be politically acceptable to others.” “I can speak for Saudi Arabia. We do have a couple of million barrels of spare capacity ... How much oil do we need – it’s not going to be anything close to that level but volumes around 1 million probably, given the fact that we will see demand in the second half rise significantly above the first half, I think 1 million sounds to me that that would be a good target to work with.” “In the mid to long term we are concerned about global trade and global economic growth obviously when the major economies clash ... It’s difficult for me to see that we’re going to see a significant drop in demand in the next 18 months or so.” (Compiled by Shadia Nasralla; Editing by Dale Hudson)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-opec-falih/highlights-saudi-energy-minister-falih-1-mln-bpd-output-rise-good-target-idUKL8N1TN322,21 Jun 2018,"Saudi Energy Minister Khalid

2018-06-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - A third of all children living in Britain, around 4.5 million, live in areas with harmful air pollution, a report by the U.N. children’s agency UNICEF said on Thursday. Britain’s government last month announced plans to curb air pollution after the European Commission said it would take Britain and five other European Union member states to the EU Court of Justice for failing to respect air quality limits. UNICEF said the plans do not go far enough and called for more funding for measures to help reduce pollution in the worst affected areas. “Under the government’s air quality plans, unsafe levels of air pollution in around 71 percent of UK towns and cities is likely to be the case for another 12 years,” the report said. A separate report by Global Action Plan, also released on Thursday, found that children are 30 percent more exposed than adults to dangerous pollution coming from vehicles on busy roads due to their shorter height. British environment minister Michael Gove said the Global Action Plan research was troubling, and showed why the government needed to take strong action to improve air quality. “Our new Clean Air Strategy sets out how we will be the first major developed economy to reduce air pollution in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) limits and we have invested 3.5 billion pounds to reduce harmful emissions,” he said in a statement.

2018-06-21,"SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese oil buyers will keep taking crude from the United States through September, but plan to reduce future purchases to avoid a likely import tariff amid a trade spat between the world’s two largest economies, multiple industry sources said.  Beijing has put U.S. energy products, including crude oil and refined products, on lists of goods that it will hit with import taxes in retaliation for similar moves by Washington. Beijing did not specify when it will impose a 25 percent tax on oil, and that gives buyers time to adjust purchases while waiting for the outcome of trade talks, the sources said.  Unipec, trading arm of Sinopec - Asia’s largest refiner and biggest buyer of U.S. oil  - has been offering U.S. crude, such as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Midland, to other Asian buyers for July, said three sources with knowledge of the offers. “They (Unipec) only offer crude for September arrival, that means July-loading cargoes,” one of the sources said, although adding that the offer was “quite expensive”. Unipec officials said this was normal trading activity, as the trading unit often re-sells excess crude from its refining system depending on economics and the state of its supplies.  A top trading executive with Sinopec told Reuters the state refiner will maintain its usual import volumes for July-loadings, but can’t commit to bookings further out.  “Future purchases (from August-loading onwards) will depend on developments,” said the executive, who asked not to be named  due to the sensitivity of the subject.  A Sinopec spokesman declined to comment. Unipec said early this year that the company expects to trade up to 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of U.S. crude oil by the end of the year, about triple the trading volume last year. That will be worth roughly $7.7 billion over the whole year based on $70 per barrel of oil.  “If the tariff is a long-term problem, the U.S. is going to struggle to find a market as big as China,” Joe Willis, senior research analyst at Wood Mackenzie said at a Thomson Reuters industry seminar on Thursday.  “I don’t see a major impact on our purchasing program. Cargoes for July loadings are unlikely be affected,” said a planning executive with a Sinopec plant that buys 1 million to 2 million barrels of U.S. oil every month.  His plant this week nominated internally with Unipec for an August loading plan that is expected to be finalised a month later, said the planning executive.  For graphic on U.S. crude oil exports to China click reut.rs/2JXqcaa China shipped in 3.89 million tonnes, or about 315,500 bpd of U.S. crude in the first quarter of this year, nearly eight times the amount a year earlier and 3.5 percent of China’s top crude oil imports, according to Chinese customs. The grades include WTI, Mars and Southern Green Canyon. Nevertheless, uncertainty over the timing of the tariff and the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks has kept some buyers from booking further ahead. Chinese refineries typically order U.S. oil three months in advance due to shipping distances. “We don’t even know whether it will eventually be carried out. What if the U.S. and China compromise and things change overnight?” said a third source, who deals U.S. oil with an independent refiner, adding that his company will stop booking U.S. crude for September deliveries into China.  Sinopec refinery sources said finding alternative supplies won’t be an issue as U.S. oil is relatively new to the Chinese market, and can be replaced by North Sea grades like Forties, Middle Eastern supplies or Russia’s Urals crude.

2018-06-21,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq’s top court upheld on Thursday a law mandating a nationwide recount of votes in a May parliamentary election but ruled that the cancellation of overseas, displaced, and Peshmerga ballots was unconstitutional. Iraq, OPEC’s second largest oil producer, faces political uncertainty after the election, which was marred by a historically low turnout and allegations of fraud. Parliament, which had mandated the recount after a government report found serious violations had taken place, had also cancelled some results such as overseas and displaced votes by amending the election law this month. The verdict from the Supreme Federal Court confirms the recount process, which was opposed by the elections commission and some parties who made significant gains in the election. “The Supreme Federal Court finds that parliament’s decision was to organise the electoral process and restore voter confidence in the electoral process; it was within parliament’s constitutional rights and does not contradict the constitution,” said Chief Justice Medhat al-Mahmoud  Attending lawmakers cheered as Mahmoud read out the verdict. The recount process has already begun after judges took over leadership of Iraq’s Independent High Elections Commission. The verdict is final and not subject to appeal. The court was tasked with ruling on the matter after the law amendment was challenged by Iraq’s president, the election commission chief, and a Kurdish party on multiple grounds. “This cancellation ... presents a squandering of votes and confiscation of the will of voters in these areas which violates constitutional articles that guarantee the right to equality and voting,” said Mahmoud. The amendment had stipulated that votes by Iraqis abroad, those displaced in the war against Islamic State in Sunni Arab provinces, and security forces in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region would be cancelled. The remainder of the election law was constitutional, the chief justice said. Plaintiffs had claimed the amendment was unconstitutional because it was passed by a parliament in which most lawmakers failed to retain their seats. The court said the current parliament’s term has not expired yet and thus it was within its rights to legislate. Nationalist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and Iranian-backed militia chief Hadi al-Amiri, who won first and second place respectively in the polls, have announced an alliance between their political blocs. But the formation of a new government is still a long way as parties engage in the traditional horse trading that follows Iraqi elections as they wait for the results to be formally ratified after the recount.

Early gains on Europe’s main bourses were wiped out after about an hour and Wall Street futures also turned lower, as the jitters that have dominated markets for months began to return. Europe’s car shares skidded to a nine-month low as Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler warned that global trade tensions were slowing its sales, while Italian stocks and bonds fell on reports a eurosceptic had been given a key finance role. Asia had been mixed too, with Japan’s Nikkei adding 0.6 percent and Australia’s main index enjoying another strong day. China finished over 1 percent lower again , while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended down 0.6 percent having been as much as 0.5 percent higher at one point. The dollar powered to an 11-month high in the currency market, maintaining pressure on inflation and on countries and firms that have gorged themselves on dollar-denominated debt in recent years. “The reaction of the dollar has been very interesting this week,” said State Street Global Markets head of macro strategy Michael Metcalfe. “In previous periods this year fears of a trade war have been dollar negative, but that has been different this week in the sense that we have had this potential escalation in the trade war and it has rallied.” The mere absence of new threats from U.S President Donald Trump on tariffs was nevertheless enough to keep hopes alive that all the bluster was a ploy which would stop short of an outright trade war. Markets had also been encouraged by the People’s Bank of China’s move to set firm fixings for its yuan, along with the addition of extra liquidity. There was also much speculation the central bank would cut bank reserve requirements, thus boosting lending power in the economy. On Wall Street on Wednesday, resilience in tech stocks helped the Nasdaq to an all-time high, though the moves were modest. While the Dow Jones fell 0.17 percent, the S&P 500 gained 0.17 percent and the Nasdaq 0.72 percent. Twenty-First Century Fox Inc had climbed 7.5 percent after Walt Disney Co sweetened its offer for some of the company’s assets to $71.3 billion, looking to topple Comcast Corp’s bid. The dollar’s latest spurt softened safe-havens such as the yen, with the dollar adding 0.31 percent to 110.71 yen. It also firmed 0.45 percent against a basket of currencies to 95.484, hitting an 11-month top and sending the euro down to a three-week low of $1.1500. Sterling was at seven-month low of $1.3116 meanwhile, having made only a fleeting bounce after Prime Minister Theresa May won another crucial Brexit vote in parliament. The Bank of England holds a policy meeting later in the session but not a single analyst polled by Reuters expects a rate hike and some are getting cold feet about a rise in August given recent soft economic data. While the European Central Bank has signalled an end to bond-buying it also pledged to keep rates low past next summer, while the Bank of Japan shows no sign of winding back its stimulus. Switzerland’s central bank keep its rates deep in negative territory on Thursday and warned that risks to the economy were rising amid all the trade war noises. “It feels like the yellow warning lights are flashing for the global economic system,” noted analysts at Citi. “However, with the ECB and BoJ still pumping in liquidity and keeping rates lower for longer, the chances of a systemic event are low.” Ahead of Friday’s meeting of oil producers in Vienna, Saudi Arabia is trying to convince fellow OPEC members of the need to raise oil output, according to sources familiar with the talks. Iran on Thursday signalled it could be won over to a small rise in output, potentially paving the way for a deal.

2018-06-21,"ULAANBAATAR, June 21 (Reuters) - The Mongolian government on Thursday submitted plans to parliament to list a chunk of the state-owned company that holds the giant Tavan Tolgoi coal mine. The potential initial public offering comes as the country looks to kickstart the long-delayed development of one of the world’s largest coking coal deposits, with international coal prices picking up after years in the doldrums. Mining minister Sumiyabazar Dolgorsuren presented a bill to parliament proposing the sale of up to 30 percent of the project on domestic and international stock markets, according to a notice on Mongolia’s official parliamentary website. The potential value of an IPO was not mentioned. The government said in a statement on Wednesday that it would also speed up plans to build a $1 billion coal-fired power plant near the mine, as well as a 247-kilometre railway that would help deliver Tavan Tolgoi’s coal to the Chinese border. “The government believes that the economic benefits of the deposit will increase,” it said in the statement. Tavan Tolgoi, in the Gobi desert about 250 kilometres (155 miles) from the Chinese border, has an estimated 7.4 billion tonnes of reserves and is considered one of Mongolia’s flagship mining projects. It is run by state-owned Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi. However, it has been held back by poor infrastructure and weak coal prices as well as disputes over the role foreign investment should play in Mongolia’s economic development. As early as 2011, Mongolia appointed BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs and Macquarie to lead an IPO for Tavan Tolgoi said to be worth as much as $15 billion, and previous administrations have discussed a triple listing for the project in London, Hong Kong and Ulaanbaatar. Mongolia also allowed international investors to bid to develop the mine’s western block in 2011, but shelved the plan amid complaints from Japan and South Korea that the process was unfair. In late 2014, a consortium consisting of Mongolia’s Energy Resources LLC., China’s Shenhua Energy and the Sumitomo Corporation of Japan was selected to invest $4 billion in the project. However, talks with the government collapsed in 2016 after a plunge in coal prices. Some analysts still doubt Mongolia is ready to launch the IPO. “I am still not convinced Tavan Tolgoi is moving any time soon as unresolved major issues still remain, such as funding for the railway and (coal) washing plant,” said Mogi Badral Bontoi, head of Cover Mongolia, an Ulaanbaatar-based market intelligence firm. “Will the Chinese be involved again? Without resolving these issues, both on paper and politically the (Tavan Tolgoi) IPO is still far from reality,” he said.

2018-06-21,"BEIJING (Reuters) - At least three U.S. coal shipments on their way to China may end up casualties of the escalating trade dispute after Beijing said it would impose steep tariffs that may kick in before the ships reach their destinations.  The addition of coal to the list of more than 650 items facing higher tariffs came as a shock to Chinese steel mills and trading firms that just last month were encouraged by Beijing to buy more U.S. coal to narrow the trade gap, four sources with knowledge of the plan said.  Although 545 items on the list face higher tariffs starting July 6, Beijing did not specify when coal and the other remaining items would be hit.  But coal’s presence on the list has sent shudders through the market.  “I am really worried. I haven’t found buyers interested in these cargoes now,” said the manager of Shanghai Runhe International Trade Co, which has three shipments of U.S. coking coal en route to China. He said Runhe had paid for the coal up front rather than using letters of credit from banks.  “Who knows what Trump is going to do next? In the worst scenario, we lost some money,” he added. He declined to be named because of company policy.  A cargo of U.S. coking coal, depending on the size of the vessel, can be worth $10 million to $30 million.  From late 2014 until January 2017, China bought no coal from the United States, as it typically costs more, takes longer to arrive and is of lower quality than Australian coal. Purchases resumed at a lower level after President Donald Trump took office, Thomson Reuters Eikon data show. Replacing American shipments with coal from other places would not be difficult, the sources said. Wang, a private coal trader who had planned to buy U.S. coal from Runhe, said he was changing course.  “That plan is now completely off the table,” said Wang, who is based in Rizhao.  “We were mystified by the trade policies. In May, my reading of the policy was that China is to step up U.S. coal buying to contribute to imports,” he added. Wang declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the topic. He is not the only one alarmed. An executive with the trading arm of a major Chinese building materials company said it had stopped talks with U.S. coal producers. “We resumed our talks with U.S. coal producers recently,” the executive said. “But our talks are stopped now.”  She added that the company had not been prepared for the policy reversal. She declined to be named due to company policy.  Trade flow data from Thomson Reuters Eikon showed that the three coal shipments, the only confirmed cargoes in transit from the United States to China, are heading to Jintang port in Hebei province.  One vessel, the Navios Taurus, loaded 65,000 tonnes in late May in Mobile, Ala., and is estimated to arrive on July 18 - 12 days after some of the proposed tariffs are set to kick in.  Another Vessel, named partnership, carrying 164,000 tonnes of coal from Virginia, is due to arrive at Jingtang port on June 26.  To view a map of U.S. coal cargoes heading for China, click: reut.rs/2K2DvXd The cargoes’ owners might risk a credit downgrade if they cannot find buyers fast enough, making it harder to borrow in the future, the building materials executive said.  “The owners of those two cargoes must be on a hot pan now,” she said.  A third vessel, the West Trader, completed loading of 161,000 tonnes of coal in Baltimore on Monday. Its listed destination is China, and it is scheduled to arrive on Aug. 10. Reuters was not able to identify the buyer of that cargo. Shanghai Runhe declined to say whether it owned any of the three vessels.   Some steel mills did not buy coking coal from the U.S. despite political pressure.  “We are much relieved that we don’t need to buy U.S. coal now,” an executive from one of China’s 10 largest steel producers said. She declined to be named because of company policy. She said that authorities told her mill in late May to buy more coking coal from the United States, but that the company couldn’t make any deals because of unattractive prices and higher shipping costs. U.S. coking coal typically costs three times more and takes three times longer to arrive than coal from Australia, data show. U.S. supplies can also be of poorer quality because of high sulphur content and low heating efficiency. “We could only afford a small volume of U.S coal even if we are asked to buy more... but I am glad it’s not a concern for us anymore,” she said. China bought 6.12 million tonnes of coking coal in 2017, of which 8.5 percent came from the United States. Shanghai Runhe did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

2018-06-21,"* Iran urges production cuts be pared to agreed levels * Saudi energy minister: market demands more oil in H2 * Russia pressing for big increase in output from July * Ecuador sees output hike by 0.5-0.6 mln bpd as compromise By Ahmad Ghaddar, Vladimir Soldatkin and Ernest Scheyder VIENNA, June 21 (Reuters) - OPEC’s leader Saudi Arabia and Russia were trying on Thursday to convince fellow oil producers to raise output from July to meet rising global demand, with Iran still signalling it would support only a modest increase in supply. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on Friday to decide output policy amid calls from top consumers such as the United States, China and India to cool down oil prices and support the world economy by producing more crude. Russia, which is not in OPEC, has proposed producers raise output by 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd), effectively wiping out supply cuts of 1.8 million bpd that have helped rebalance the market in the past 18 months and lifted oil to around $75 per barrel. Oil traded as low as $27 in 2016. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih also said on Wednesday that the market demanded more oil in the second half of this year and that OPEC was moving towards “a good decision”. OPEC’s third-largest producer, Iran, has so far been the main barrier to a deal as it said on Tuesday OPEC was unlikely to reach an agreement and should reject pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to pump more oil. But on Wednesday, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said OPEC members that had overdelivered on cuts in recent months should comply with agreed quotas. That would effectively mean a modest boost from producers such as Saudi Arabia that have been cutting more deeply than planned despite production outages in Venezuela and Libya. Iran’s production is also likely to fall in the second half of 2018 due to new U.S. sanctions. Ecuador said OPEC and its allies could agree to a compromise increase in output of around 0.5-0.6 million bpd. Zanganeh was due to attend a ministerial committee on Thursday. Iran is usually not part of the committee, which includes Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait, Algeria and Venezuela. Before the committee meeting, Zanganeh was also scheduled to meet Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak for separate talks. Iraq and Venezuela have also opposed a relaxation of production cuts, fearing a slump in prices.

2018-06-21,"DUSHANBE (Reuters) - Tajikistan has chosen not to borrow from the World Bank to finance the construction of the Rogun hydroelectric power plant, a bank executive told Reuters. The former Soviet republic issued its debut $500 million Eurobond last year to raise money for the $3.9 billion megaproject, but it remains unclear where further funding will come from. Cyrill Muller, World Bank vice president for Europe and Central Asia, said in an interview on the sidelines of a water management conference in Dushanbe that the bank would instead focus on upgrading another major Tajik hydro plant. “The reason for us not financing Rogun is that the government had a number of choices on how to proceed with Rogun and they... wanted to accelerate the process and it was felt that the World Bank would be more helpful supporting other investments in the energy sector,” he said. “In cooperation with the government we decided to finance the refurbishing of the Nurek power plant and that will be our major investment in the energy sector at this stage.” Mountainous Tajikistan, one of the poorest ex-Soviet nations, believes it ranks eighth in the world with regards to hydroelectric power potential, but the Central Asian country  currently utilizes less than five percent of that. The Dushanbe government has hired Italy’s Salini Impregilo to build the world’s tallest dam on the Vakhsh River which will power six turbines, eliminating domestic energy shortages and enabling exports of electric power to countries such as Pakistan and Afghanistan. It plans to launch the first turbine in December and start making cash from power sales to finance further construction. But the project may require additional financing before it starts paying for itself. Tajikistan indicated in February it could issue more bonds to fund Rogun and the absence of World Bank financing makes such borrowing more likely. At the same time, Muller said, improved relations between Tajikistan and its neighbor Uzbekistan - which had previously flatly objected to the dam construction - create good prospects for power exports. The Nurek power plant whose refurbishment the bank has agreed to partly finance with a soft $225.7 million loan, produces three-fourths of Tajikistan’s power.

2018-06-21,"June 21 (Reuters) - China’s fracking support industry has grown rapidly over the past decade and now makes everything from fracking trucks and pumps to proppants, while local service providers are learning to match global rivals like Schlumberger and Baker Hughes. State majors Sinopec and CNPC produced 9 billion cubic metres (bcm) of shale gas in 2017 from 600 wells, six percent of the country’s total gas output. Production is forecast to double to 17 bcm in 2020, which will include production from another 700 wells, said consultancy Wood Mackenzie. China’s shale gas reserves are buried deeper, more scattered and in more mountainous terrain than in the United States, making them more costly to develop, but domestic gas is a major focus as the country looks to ease its reliance on dirtier coal. Reuters interviewed Chinese oil majors, local equipment and service companies and global firms involved in China’s fracking industry to compile the following industry breakdown. Jingzhou-based Jianghan No.4 Machinery Plant, a unit of Sinopec Oilfield Equipment Corp, is China’s leading manufacturer of fracking equipment. The firm bought several dozen U.S. fracking trucks in 1988 on condition it be allowed access to the technology, and clinched a similar technology transfer deal in the same year with U.S. company SPM, acquired by the Weir Group in 2007, that makes equipment designed for high-pressure fracturing and handling fracking fluids. Jianghan benefited from hundreds of millions of yuan in grants for special national technological projects to help develop its fleet, a company official said. The company has built several hundred fracking trucks and primarily supplies Sinopec, China’s leading shale gas producer. Baoshi Machinery Co Ltd, controlled by state energy group CNPC, is also a major producer of fracking equipment. Industry service provider Sichuan Honghua Petroleum Equipment Co. Ltd, 30 percent controlled by state-run China Aerospace Science & Industry Corp, began making eletric-powered fracking pumps in 2015. It currently has 20 units under lease to Sinopec and PetroChina. Electric frackers, which have been adopted in the United States by companies like Evolution Well Services and U.S. Well Services, are smaller and quieter than diesel equipment and cut fuel costs by half. They are also more than twice as powerful as regular diesel frackers, but require easy access to power grids. While state-run firms focus on the domestic market, independent firms Jereh Group and Honghua Group have been expanding sales of trucks and pumps to the United States. SJS, a joint venture between Sinopec Oilfield Equipment and U.S. Serva Group, makes bridge plugs, used to isolate zones in shale drilling. Sinopec officials said the SJS plugs cost a fraction of competing products. The oil price crash of 2014 forced Sinopec and CNPC to build up internal teams as they cut down on foreign service providers to slash drilling costs. CNPC’s main services arms are Chuanqing Drilling and Prospecting, Greatwall Drilling, Xibu Drilling, Bohai Drilling. Sinopec operates six regional service providers such as Jianghan, Zhongyuan and Shengli. As drilling has picked up with a rebound in oil prices, local independents such as Anton Oilfield Services, SPT Energy Group, Honghua International and Jereh have returned, mostly as subcontractors to state firms. SPT said in May that it won a 428 million yuan ($68 million) contract to drill 14 wells in Sichuan that includes drilling, fracturing and test production. Honghua separately agreed to drill four wells for 240 million yuan. Anton late last year won a 100 million yuan deal to drill four shale wells in Sichuan for PetroChina. The deal does not include equipment. “We’re hoping to see freer competition among service providers, rather than being just second options,” said a top executive with an independent service provider. $1 = 6.3401 Chinese yuan renminbi

2018-06-21,"CHONGQING, China (Reuters) - On a flattened mountaintop a two-and-half-hour drive south of Chongqing in southwest China, a fleet of towering, red fracking trucks pumps chemicals and sand into a 1,500-metre horizontal well deep under the ground. The equipment was designed and built by China’s state-owned energy major Sinopec, the result of a decades-long government drive to develop low-cost domestic technology to tap the country’s vast shale gas resources buried in the region’s mountainous terrain. It is the latest key technology that China has learned to master.  Except for a handful of higher-end tools, Sinopec and a crop of independent companies make everything from trucks and pumps to drilling fluid and proppants - treated sand or man-made ceramics used to “prop” open a fracture to allow gas to escape. “We’re doing 95 percent or more of the service jobs ourselves. The amount of work handled by foreign firms is minimal,” said Shi Yuanhui, a senior Sinopec service engineer. The government-backed push, motivated in part by cost cutting amid the oil price slump of 2014, has seen international firms like oil services group Schlumberger (SLB.N), Halliburton (HAL.N) or Baker Hughes (GE.N) scale back operations in China. Meanwhile, Chinese firms are starting to export equipment including pressure pumps, even to the home of the shale boom in the United States. Over the past 8 years, the cost of building a well has nearly halved to an average of under 50 million yuan per well (5.92 million pounds), and drilling speed has improved by two-thirds to 45-60 days, according to interviews with state oil officials, equipment makers and service providers. “China has over the years developed its unique practice that employs home-manufactured compact drilling equipment to suit the terrains, and improved greatly on drilling efficiency,” said Lynn Lin of energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Schlumberger and Baker Hughes declined to comment on their China shale business. Halliburton did not respond to a request for comment. State energy giants Sinopec (0386.HK) and PetroChina (0857.HK) pumped 9 billion cubic metres (bcm) of shale gas in 2017, up from scratch a decade ago and equivalent to about 6 percent of the country’s total natural gas production. Still, the hilltop scene illustrates some of the problems facing the world’s biggest energy consumer in exploiting its unconventional gas. Unlike the flatter U.S. regions containing shale, Chinese firms operate in tricky environments, including mountainous, arid, remote and also highly populated regions, leading to higher costs. China’s shale is also buried deeper and is more fractured, making it difficult and expensive to extract. China is expected to nearly double output to 17 bcm by 2020, according to Wood Mackenzie. While below Beijing’s 2020 target of 30 bcm, set out four years ago, and just a fraction of 474 bcm produced in the United States last year, domestic gas is a major focus as the country looks to ease its reliance on dirtier coal. China’s leading manufacturer of fracking equipment is Jianghan No.4 Machinery Plant, which accounts for more than half of the country’s production of fracking trucks and pumps. The firm, under the supervision of what was then the Ministry of Petroleum, bought several dozen U.S. fracking trucks in 1988 on condition the manufacturer allowed access to its technology, said a Jianghan marketing executive who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media. The know-how was initially applied to conventional wells before Jianghan No.4, now part of Sinopec, China’s top shale gas firm, built the country’s first shale fracker in 2012. Baoji Machinery, a unit of state-run CNPC, and independent equipment builders Honghua Group (0196.HK) and Jereh Group 002353.SZ have also expanded into shale, and are competing in new, more efficient electric-powered frackers.     Jereh and Honghua are also leading an export push, said company officials, competing with the likes of Halliburton.  Jereh exports trucks, pressure pumps and pipes, with total overseas sales making up half of its 3.2 billion yuan ($495 million) in revenue in 2017, a company spokeswoman said, declining to give a breakdown by country. Lucrative export contracts will be needed as China’s shale industry still struggles to make cash at home. Sinopec has acknowledged it would be difficult to break even without government subsidies, currently at roughly 20 percent of well-head prices.[nB9N1O405G] Helping increase efficiency, Chinese firms can now drill multiple wells at a single pad, known as “well factory” drilling. They can also carry out extended horizontal fracturing up to 3,000 metres, Sinopec engineers said. The expertise will be needed if China is to make the most of its shale gas, estimated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration as the world’s largest. Western majors like Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Total (TOTF.PA), ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Chevron (CVX.N) largely abandoned China’s shale scene after disappointing initial results.      Geologists at Sinopec said they have struggled to replicate a find like Fuling, the largest commercial field, a gas field similar, but smaller, to the hugely successful U.S. Marcellus formation. There are also complaints that Sinopec’s and PetroChina’s domination is a barrier to future development, as these state behemoths hinder competition. Only in late 2017, as shale drilling quickened on the back of rising oil prices LCOc1, did the two majors start awarding service contracts to independent firms like SPT Energy (1251.HK), Anton Oilfield (3337.HK) and Honghua Group (0196.HK).

2018-06-21,"* Most shares make tentative gains, await news on trade * Growing talk of China stimulus underpins sentiment * Dollar index holds near 11-month top, yen eases * Oil wary ahead of OPEC meeting on risk of expanded supply * European shares seen rising 0.3-0.4 pct By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, June 21 (Reuters) - Shares crept higher in most major markets on Thursday as a lull in the Sino-U.S. trade tussle and talk of more stimulus in China helped calm nerves, though the nagging trade tensions caused Chinese shares to slip, dragging other Asian markets lower. Oil prices eased a touch as nerves grew ahead of Friday’s meeting between OPEC and other big producers, including Russia, with growing expectations that the Vienna talks could result in an agreement to increase crude supplies. European shares are expected to rise, with spread-betters calling a higher opening of 0.4 percent in Britain’s FTSE and France’s CAC 40 and 0.3 percent in Germany’s DAX. Japan’s Nikkei added 0.6 percent while futures for the S&P 500 rose 0.3 percent as investors waited for new developments on global trade. Australia’s main index had another strong day, rising 1 percent on fund manager demand before the end of the local financial year next week. Asian shares, however, struggled to keep early gains on concerns about the trade war. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had gained as much as 0.5 percent before falls led by Chinese shares pushed it down 0.4 percent. The CSI300 index of Shanghai and Shenzen shares dropped 0.4 percent. Still, the mere absence of new threats from President Donald Trump on tariffs was enough to stem recent selling in many markets, with investors clinging to the hope that all the bluster was a ploy which would stop short of an outright trade war. “Many participants see the Trump Administration’s hard line as part of the negotiating strategy,” said Richard Grace, chief currency strategist at CBA. Markets had also been encouraged by the People’s Bank of China’s move to set firm fixings for its yuan, along with the addition of extra liquidity. There was also much speculation the central bank would cut bank reserve requirements, thus boosting lending power in the economy. On Wall Street, resilience in tech stocks helped the Nasdaq to an all-time high, though the moves were modest. While the Dow Jones fell 0.17 percent, the S&P 500 gained 0.17 percent and the Nasdaq 0.72 percent. Twenty-First Century Fox Inc climbed 7.5 percent after Walt Disney Co sweetened its offer for some of the company’s assets to $71.3 billion, looking to topple Comcast Corp’s bid. Receding risk aversion softened safe-havens such as the yen, with the dollar adding 0.31 percent to 110.71 yen. The dollar also firmed 0.3 percent against a basket of currencies to 95.323, hitting an 11-month top. The euro was down slightly at $1.1552. Sterling hit seven-month lows at $1.3140 having made only a fleeting bounce after Prime Minister Theresa May won another crucial Brexit vote in parliament.

2018-06-21,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - On the palm-fringed beaches of Christmas Island, a speck of land in the Indian Ocean between Australia and Indonesia, plastic waste is piling up on the white sand and killing marine life. Flotsam and jetsam, especially plastic bags and one-use containers, cover the shoreline of the Australian island. Volunteers recently collected 1.5 tonnes of waste in just a few days. The scene illustrates growing concerns about the environmental damage from rising amounts of plastic waste globally. “People really need to understand that an item that they’ve used can cause so much harm in the environment,” said Heidi Taylor, managing director of Tangaroa Blue, an Australian charity that picks up marine rubbish. Some 8 million tonnes of plastic garbage - bottles, packaging and other waste - is dumped in the sea every year, killing marine life, the United Nations Environment Programme says. Earlier this month, a pilot whale washed up and died in Thailand with 80 plastic bags in its stomach, an incident that grabbed news headlines globally. Turtles, which nest year round at Christmas Island, are particularly vulnerable. Plastic clogs their gut and traps air, so they are unable to dive deep enough to feed. Instead, they are confined to the upper reaches of the ocean, making them an easy target for predators and at risk of being hit by boats. “Plastic bags look very similar to a jellyfish in the water and jellyfish is a thing that all sea turtles love to eat,” said Kathy Townsend, animal ecology lecturer at the University of the Sunshine Coast at Hervey Bay, 280 km (170 miles) north of Brisbane. Less than a 10th of all plastic ever produced has been recycled, according to U.N. report published in June that recommends governments consider banning or taxing single-use bags or food containers to stem a tide of pollution. This week, Australia’s biggest grocer Woolworths Group Ltd stopped offering free plastic bags to customers to carry their shopping in and said it would cease selling plastic straws by the end of the year. Thailand, which makes about 4 or 5 billion plastic bags a year out of a total of roughly 5 trillion used globally, plans to halve production by 2027, according to Jatuporn Buruspat, head of the country’s Marine and Coastal Resources Department. The Thai arm of Britain’s biggest retailer Tesco Plc offers rewards to customers who eschew plastic bags. “I’m really optimistic that we can actually get on top of this,” Townsend said. “Future generations, they’re going to look back at us and laugh and just say: ‘How wasteful were they? Look at how much stuff that they just wasted!’” Reporting by Jill Gralow in SYDNEY.

2018-06-21,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. travelers will hit the roads, rails and airports in record numbers this Fourth of July holiday, despite higher gasoline prices, the nation’s largest automotive advocacy group said on Thursday. Some 46.9 million Americans will travel 50 miles (80 km) over the upcoming July Fourth holiday, the fifth consecutive annual increase and highest travel volume since the group began tracking data 18 years ago, according to the AAA, or American Automobile Association. The holiday period is defined this year as July 3 to July 8.  Gas prices have fallen a bit since the 2018 high of $2.97 a gallon set over Memorial Day weekend, the last weekend in May. The national average gas price was $2.87 on Wednesday, up 59 cents from a year ago.  Despite higher prices, automobile travel is expected to increase for the fourth straight year, rising 5.1 percent or nearly 2 million more than in 2017, to 39.7 million travelers, the AAA said.  “Confident consumers with additional disposable income will look to spend on travel this holiday, building on an already busy summer travel season,” said Bill Sutherland, senior vice president, AAA Travel and Publishing.  Air travel volume will increase to 3.76 million passengers, 7.9 percent more than last year. With the holiday falling on a Wednesday, air travel is helped by enabling more flexibility to fly either before or after the holiday, the group said. U.S. gasoline demand, which accounts for roughly 10 percent of global demand, hit record highs last year thanks in part to a strong summer driving season.

2018-06-21,"FUKUSHIMA, Japan (Reuters) - On a cold day in February, Takuto Okamoto guided his first tour group to a sight few outsiders had witnessed in person: the construction cranes looming over Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Seven years after a deadly tsunami ripped through the Tokyo Electric Power (9501.T) plant, Okamoto and other tour organisers are bringing curious sightseers to the region as residents who fled the nuclear catastrophe trickle back. Many returnees hope tourism will help resuscitate their towns and ease radiation fears. But some worry about drawing a line under a disaster whose impact will be felt far into the future. The cleanup, including the removal of melted uranium fuel, may take four decades and cost several billion U.S. dollars a year.  “The disaster happened and the issue now is how people rebuild their lives,” Okamoto said after his group stopped in Tomioka, 10 kilometres (6.21 miles) south of the nuclear plant. He wants to bring groups twice a week, compared with only twice a month now.  Electronic signs on the highway to Tomioka showed radiation around 100 times normal background levels, as Okamoto’s passengers peered out tour bus windows at the cranes poking above Fukushima Daiichi. “For me, it’s more for bragging rights, to be perfectly honest,” said Louie Ching, 33, a Filipino programmer. Ching, two other Filipinos and a Japanese man who visited Chernobyl last year each paid 23,000 yen ($208.75) for a day trip from Tokyo. The group had earlier wandered around Namie, a town 4 kilometres north of the plant to which residents began returning last year after authorities lifted restrictions. So far, only about 700 of 21,000 people are back - a ratio similar to that of other ghost towns near the nuclear site.   Former residents Mitsuru Watanabe, 80, and his wife Rumeko, 79, have no plans to return. They were only in town to clear out their shuttered restaurant before it is demolished, and they chatted with tourists while they worked.  “We used to pull in around 100 million yen a year,” Mitsuru said as he invited the tourists inside. A 2011 calendar hung on the wall, and unfilled orders from the evacuation day remained on a whiteboard in the kitchen.  “We want people to come. They can go home and tell other people about us,” Mitsuru said among the dusty tables. Okamoto’s group later visited the nearby coastline, where the tsunami killed hundreds of people. Abandoned rice paddies, a few derelict houses that withstood the wave and the gutted Ukedo elementary school are all that remain.  It’s here, behind a new sea wall at the edge of the restricted radiation zone, that Fukushima Prefecture plans to build a memorial park and 5,200-square-metre (56,000-square-foot) archive centre with video displays and exhibits about the quake, tsunami and nuclear calamity.  “It will be a starting point for visitors,” Kazuhiro Ono, the prefecture’s deputy director for tourism, said of the centre. The Japan Tourism Agency will fund the project, Ono added.  Ono wants tourists to come to Fukushima, particularly foreigners, who have so far steered clear. Overseas visitors spent more than 70 million days in Japan last year, triple the number in 2011. About 94,000 of those were in Fukushima.    Tokyo Electric will provide material for the archive, although the final budget for the project has yet to be finalised, he said.  “Some people have suggested a barbecue area or a promenade,” said Hidezo Sato, a former seed merchant in Namie who leads a residents’ group. A “1” sticker on the radiation metre around his neck identified him as being the first to return to the town.    “If people come to brag about getting close to the plant, that can’t be helped, but at least they’ll come,” Sato said. The archive will help ease radiation fears, he added. Standing outside a farmhouse as workmen refurbished it so her family could return, Mayumi Matsumoto, 54, said she was uneasy about the park and archive.   “We haven’t gotten to the bottom of what happened at the plant, and now is not the time,” she said.  Matsumoto had come back for a day to host a rice-planting event for about 40 university students. Later they toured Namie on two buses, including a stop at scaffolding near the planned memorial park site to view Fukushima Daiichi’s cranes.   Matsumoto described her feelings toward Tokyo Electric as “complicated,” because it is responsible for the disaster but also helped her family cope its aftermath. One of her sons works for the utility and has faced abuse from angry locals, she added. “It’s good that people want to come to Namie, but not if they just want to get close to the nuclear plant. I don’t want it to become a spectacle,” Matsumoto said.  Okamoto is not the only guide offering tours in the area, although visits of any kind remain rare. He said he hoped his clients would come away with more than a few photographs. “If people can see for themselves the damage caused by tsunami and nuclear plant, they will understand that we need to stop it from happening again,” said Okamoto, who attended university in a neighbouring prefecture. “So far, we haven’t come across any opposition from the local people.” ($1 = 110.1800 yen) Reporting by Tim Kelly; additional reporting by Kwiyeon Ha and Toru Hanai; Editing by Gerry Doyle",https://uk.reuters.com/article/japan-fukushima-nuclear-tourism/as-fukushima-residents-return-some-see-hope-in-nuclear-tourism-idUKL3N1SS2TR,21 Jun 2018,"On a cold day in

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.4 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei added 0.7 percent. Australia’s main index had another strong day, rising 1 percent on fund manager demand before the end of the local financial year next week. Futures for the S&P 500 added 0.4 percent as investors waited for new developments on global trade. After a hesitant start, Chinese markets moved into positive territory as Shanghai blue chips rose 0.6 percent. The mere absence of new threats from President Donald Trump on tariffs was enough to stem recent selling, with investors clinging to the hope that all the bluster was a ploy which would stop short of an outright trade war. “Many participants see the Trump Administration’s hard line as part of the negotiating strategy,” said Richard Grace, chief currency strategist at CBA. Markets had also been encouraged by the People’s Bank of China’s move to set firm fixings for its yuan, along with the addition of extra liquidity. There was also much speculation the central bank would cut bank reserve requirements, thus boosting lending power in the economy. On Wall Street, resilience in tech stocks helped the Nasdaq to an all-time high, though the moves were modest. While the Dow Jones fell 0.17 percent, the S&P 500 gained 0.17 percent and the Nasdaq 0.72 percent. Twenty-First Century Fox Inc climbed 7.5 percent after Walt Disney Co sweetened its offer for some of the company’s assets to $71.3 billion, looking to topple Comcast Corp’s bid. Receding risk aversion softened safe-havens such as the yen, with the dollar adding 0.24 percent to 110.62. The dollar also firmed 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies to 95.159, just off an 11-month top of 95.299. The euro was flat at $1.1571. Sterling was pinned near seven-month lows at $1.3169 having made only a fleeting bounce after Prime Minister Theresa May won another crucial Brexit vote in parliament.

2018-06-21,"* OPEC to meet in Vienna on June 22 to agree output policy * Iran previously resisted any OPEC output rise * Supply rise would come among amid strong demand * U.S. refinery runs hit record, crude stocks decline By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, June 21 (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Thursday as Iran signalled it could be won over to a small rise in OPEC crude output, likely paving the road for the producer cartel to agree a supply increase during a meeting on June 22. However, prices were prevented from falling further by record refinery runs in the United States and a large decline in U.S. crude inventories, a sign of strong fuel demand in the world’s biggest economy. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $74.55 per barrel at 0040 GMT, down 19 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $65.63 a barrel, down 8 cents. Iran, a major supplier within the producer cartel of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), signalled on Wednesday it could agree on a small increase in the group’s output during a meeting at OPEC’s headquarters in Vienna on June 22. “There appears to be an air of confidence that this deal will move through,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. Tehran had previously resisted pressure by OPEC’s de-facto leader Saudi Arabia to raise output. OPEC, together with other key producers including Russia, started withholding output in 2017 to prop up prices, but a tightening market in 2018 led to calls by major consumers for more supplies. In a sign of strong demand, U.S. refineries processed a seasonal record of 17.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil last week, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday. Amid strong consumption, commercial U.S. crude inventories dropped by 5.9 million barrels in the week to June 15, to 426.53 million barrels C-STK-T-EIA, the EIA said. U.S. crude oil prodution C-OUT-T-EIA was flat week-on-week, remaining at a record 10.9 million bpd.

Australia’s competition watchdog had in December blocked the A$1.8 billion ($1.33 billion) purchase of Woolworths’ petrol stations, even after BP offered to sell some stations to ease competition concerns. Woolworths said the sale agreements and strategic partnership agreements entered with BP in December 2016 will therefore not be continued by BP.

2018-06-21,"WASHINGTON, June 20 (Reuters) - A scheduled trip to West Virginia by executives from China Energy Investment Corp to discuss a planned $83.7 billion  investment in the state has been cancelled, the latest victim of a growing trade war between the United States and China. The investment by China Energy, which ranks among the world’s largest power companies by asset value, was the biggest among a slew of deals signed during U.S. President Donald Trump’s state visit to Beijing in November. The total value of the deals could be as much as $250 billion. Brian Anderson, director of the West Virginia University Energy Institute, told Reuters on Wednesday the executives were due to arrive in West Virginia last weekend to discuss where to invest in shale gas, power and petrochemical projects. “The original plan was for the CEO of China Energy and a delegation to arrive over this past weekend and be here in West Virginia with our state officials and others,” said Anderson. “But that visit was cancelled because it would be inappropriate in the midst of this trade dispute for China to come,” he said. China Energy could not immediately be reached for comment. Among planned stopovers by the delegation was an appearance at the Northeast U.S. Petrochemical Construction Conference in Pittsburgh on Tuesday. The gas and power agreement signed as part of Trump’s Beijing visit marked the first overseas investment for newly founded China Energy, which formed from a merger of China Shenhua Group , the country’s largest coal producer and China Guodian Corp, one of its top five utilities. The Trump administration announced $50 million in tariffs on Chinese goods last week. In return, China retaliated with tariffs on U.S. exports and threatened to impose more duties on U.S. energy exports. China’s investment would be a game changer for West Virginia, which had an annual Gross State Product of less than $83 billion last year. West Virginia Governor Jim Justice, a Trump ally, has said the investment deal would boost his economically ailing state’s natural gas and petrochemical industries and create jobs. Trump made West Virginia and its coal miners a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, promising to create jobs for laid-off miners, revive the coal industry and boost its sagging economy. Justice declined to comment on whether he was concerned that trade frictions jeopardized the China Energy investment, but Anderson said the governor had been in regular contact with Trump. Among the investments under consideration is an Appalachian Storage and Trading Hub for hydrocarbons, such as ethane and butane, as well as two power plants in the state. West Virginia’s Chamber of Commerce and coal association are watching Washington-Beijing developments with concern. Mark Drennan, a Republican senator in the West Virginia state legislature, said the promised investment was likely being used by China to gain leverage in the trade dispute. “They’ve spent a lot of time and effort in West Virginia,” he said of China Energy. “I would hope it (the trip) would be rescheduled.” Anderson, who has been coordinating visits from Chinese delegations, said he was optimistic that the trade row would eventually be seen as little more than one of many “speed bumps” along the way of an investment deal that would extend over a 20-year period.
