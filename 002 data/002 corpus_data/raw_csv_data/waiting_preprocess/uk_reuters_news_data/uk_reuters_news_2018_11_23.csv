Most power plants in west Germany, corresponding to 37 gigawatt of electricity in total, will go offline between 2022 and 2030, the report added, whereas plants in east Germany would not go offline before a second phase starts in 2030. The coal commission will summon the government to negotiate a compensation agreement with utilities, Der Spiegel said, adding that the commission would opt for a solution in which companies would get more money the sooner they shut down their plants.

2018-11-23,"(Adds details, background) KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Malaysia’s Petronas said on Friday production at the Kebabangan gas field in the eastern state of Sabah was expected to return to full capacity by August 2019 following disruption caused by a gas leak at an associated pipeline. The problem was caused by a leak from the Sabah Sarawak Gas Pipeline in January, the state energy firm said in an emailed statement to Reuters. Repair works on the pipeline have been completed, and integrity assurance tests being conducted on the 500-kilometre pipeline are expected to be finished by July 2019, it said. “The supply disruption, however, did not impact our LNG (liquefied natural gas) cargo deliveries to customers,” Petronas said. Last week, Malaysia’s finance minister said the country’s economic growth was impacted by supply disruption at the Kebabangan gas field. Gas exports have been severely impacted since the second quarter, he said. Malaysia is the world’s third-biggest exporter of LNG, and Petronas is a significant contributor to state coffers. The country’s economy grew at its slowest in two years in the July-September quarter, in part because of “supply shocks” in the LNG sector. Growth in the prior quarter had also been hit by supply disruptions. Reuters reported in August that Malaysia’s exports of LNG fell to a four-year low in July as domestic gas pipeline issues since January took their toll. Recent trade data showed Malaysia’s third-quarter LNG exports totalled 8.7 billion ringgit ($2.1 billion) in value, down about 21 percent from the same period last year. $1 = 4.1920 ringgit

Unions rejected on Thursday 1.5 percent salary increase offer by employers and had urged their members to step up the strike, which began on Wednesday. Total’s Grandpuits refinery south of Paris is one of the refineries where workers are striking, and it only has enough crude oil to continue functioning until Sunday midday, Thierry Defresne of the CGT told Reuters. There was no immediate reaction from Total. However, workers at two of the refineries that had been on strike - Total’s Donges refinery in the northwest and Exxon Mobil Corp’s Fos-sur-Mer refinery in the south - voted to suspend their action pending salary talks, Defresne said.

2018-11-23,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A German court has ruled Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) must reimburse the owner of a Golf the full original price of his vehicle bought in 2012, dealing a blow to the carmaker as the legal battles over its emissions cheating scandal drag on. Volkswagen (VW) said it believed the court in Augsburg had misapplied the law and that it would appeal the ruling at the higher regional court. The Augsburg civil court ruled on Nov. 14th that VW had acted immorally by deliberately installing emissions-cheating software to increase sales and profits, a spokesman for the court said on Friday. The court ordered VW to repay the owner the original price of almost 30,000 euros ($34,200), according to a copy of the ruling. “In our opinion, there is no legal basis for customer complaints. Customers have suffered neither losses nor damages. The vehicles are safe and roadworthy,” VW said in a statement. It added that around 9,000 judgements had been issued in connection with its diesel emissions scandal, which came to light in 2015, and the majority of customer complaints had been unsuccessful at district and higher courts. “The decision of the district court in Augsburg thereby stands in contradiction to multiple decisions of other courts in comparable cases,” VW said. Its shares were little changed at 151.88 euros at 0844 GMT. VW has said about 11 million diesel cars worldwide were fitted with software that could cheat emissions tests designed to limit noxious car fumes. The German carmaker has agreed to pay billions of dollars in the United States to settle claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers. It offered to buy back 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. The company has not reached a similar deal in Europe, where it faces billions of euros in claims from investors and customers in the worst business crisis in its history.

2018-11-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP has started production at the Clair Ridge oil field in the West of Shetlands region of the North Sea, targeting a peak output of 120,000 barrels per day, it said on Friday. The Clair Ridge project is the second phase of the Clair field, located 75 km (47 miles) west of Shetlands. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS), Chevron (CVX.N) and ConocoPhillips CON.N also hold stakes in the field. In addition to two bridge-linked platforms, the Clair Ridge project included a new oil and gas pipeline tying it to the Clair export pipeline, which delivers oil to the onshore Sullom Voe terminal, BP said in a statement. Clair was first discovered in 1977 and is one of a number of big developments in the West of Shetland area, where other oil companies are investing.   The new project is designed to recover 640 million barrels of oil. Clair Ridge is BP’s sixth major project start-up in 2018, after starting up seven in 2017. All these projects will boost the London-based company’s output by 900,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021. British Energy Minister Claire Perry said in a statement that Clair Ridge was vital for the country’s energy security. “Aided by the innovative use of technology developed in the UK and a strong UK-based supply chain worth £1.5 billion, this will allow the North Sea to continue to be a hub for the high-skilled, well-paid jobs at the centre of our modern Industrial Strategy.” Reporting by Ron Bousso; Editing by Edmund Blair and Emelia Sithole-Matarise",https://uk.reuters.com/article/bp-clairridge/update-1-bp-starts-production-at-clair-ridge-field-in-north-sea-idUKL8N1XY1IX,23 Nov 2018,"BP has started production at the

2018-11-23,"* Oct gasoline exports drop 33 pct from year earlier * Oct diesel exports rise 19 pct from year earlier * Oct jet-kero exports rise 23 pct from year earlier BEIJING, Nov 23 (Reuters) - China’s gasoline exports in October fell to their lowest in 13 months amid a glut of the fuel in Asia and globally, customs data showed on Friday. Gasoline exports last month were 650,000 tonnes, the lowest since September 2017 and 33 percent lower than a year ago, data from the General Administration of Customs showed. Stockpiles of gasoline have surged across Asia, with inventories in Singapore, the regional refining hub, rising to a three-month high while Japanese stockpiles also climbed last week. Inventories in the United States are about 7 percent higher than a year ago. Demand for middle distillates in Asia, however, remains strong, accounting for a surge in China’s diesel and kerosene exports last month. October diesel exports were 1.44 million tonnes, up nearly 40 percent from September and 19 percent higher than the 1.209 million tonnes a year earlier, the customs data showed. Exports of jet-kerosene rose to 1.19 million tonnes, up from September’s 990,000 tonnes and 970,000 tonnes in October 2017. China’s overall refined fuel exports in October rose 7.8 percent from a year earlier. The stronger overseas sales also followed the government issuing nearly 3 million tonnes of additional fuel export quotas in late October, more than half of which are for jet fuel. These new quotas — all to state oil firms — would take China’s total fuel export quotas to around 46 million tonnes, compared to 43 million for 2017, as refiners wanted to bolster domestic margins by thinning the supply pool amid an expanding surplus. Imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) rose to 4.6 million tonnes last month, up from 4.37 million tonnes the previous month and 3.57 million tonnes a year earlier, ahead of the heating season when demand for the fuel rises, the customs data showed.

2018-11-23,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - North American oil producers that have been increasing spending to take advantage of this year’s higher prices will dial back as November’s reversal fuels worries about a 2019 surplus, energy executives say. U.S. light sweet crude settled on Friday at $50.42 a barrel, down nearly 23 percent since October and the lowest in more than a year over worries about oversupply and the Sino-U.S. trade war. The drop comes as many oil producers are assembling drilling budgets for 2019.  “Everybody’s going to get hit,” said Cole Frederick, co-founder of Peak Land Services, which helps oil companies acquire properties in Texas shale fields. He noted, however, that November’s price is well above the lows that put hundreds of smaller companies out of business in early 2016. “I was praying for $50 oil two years ago when the price was $26,” Frederick said in an interview. “If you’re a smaller guy, you’ve got to be more selective.”  Oil in West Texas and North Dakota traded at discounts to the U.S. benchmark of around $6 and $15 a barrel, respectively, as production outran transport space to carry crude to markets. In Western Canada, heavy oil on Friday fell to a $37 discount to U.S. crude futures.    “A lot of corporations are going to have a heck of a time determining what level of expenditure they can handle next year,” Andy Mah, chief executive of Calgary-based Advantage Oil & Gas, told Reuters. His company may reduce its 2019 budget if weak prices persist.  Smaller Texas producers had already curbed some activity, said Ryan Sitton, who sits on the Texas Railroad Commission, the state’s energy regulator.  “Six weeks ago some of these were profitable and now they’re break-even,” said Sitton. “The (price) swing has been large enough that we have some companies that are no longer generating free cash flow.” Some producers have alleviated the price drop by locking in favourable prices for fourth-quarter production using hedges that will lessen the near-term impact on profit and activity.  “All we’ve seen is increases” in drilling activity, said Clint Concord, a sales manager at drilling services firm Byrd Oilfield Services in Midland, Texas. The effect of falling crude prices “takes a while to hit the field.”   Byrd this year doubled the number of well jobs to 350 per month and the company added several employees each week to take on work for producers, Concord said.

2018-11-23,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Oil prices slumped up to nearly 8 percent to the lowest in more than a year on Friday, posting the seventh consecutive weekly loss, amid intensifying fears of a supply glut even as major producers consider cutting output. Oil supply, led by U.S. producers, is growing faster than demand and to prevent a build-up of unused fuel such as the one that emerged in 2015, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to start trimming output after a meeting on Dec. 6. But this has done little so far to prop up prices, which have dropped more than 20 percent so far in November, in a seven-week streak of losses. Prices were on course for their biggest one-month decline since late 2014. A trade war between the world’s two biggest economies and oil consumers, the United States and China, has weighed upon the market.  “The market is pricing in an economic slowdown - they are anticipating that the Chinese trade talks are not going to go well,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago, referring to expected talks next week between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires.  “The market doesn’t believe that OPEC is going to be able to act swiftly enough to offset the coming slowdown in demand,” Flynn said.  Brent crude futures settled down $3.80 a barrel, or 6.1 percent at $58.80. During the session, the benchmark dropped to $58.41, the lowest since October 2017.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) lost $4.21, or 7.7 percent, to trade at $50.42, also the weakest since October 2017. In post-settlement trade, the contract continued to fall.  For the week, Brent fell 11.3 percent and WTI posted a 10.8 percent decline, the largest one-week drop since January 2016.  Market fears over weak demand intensified after China reported its lowest gasoline exports in more than a year amid a glut of the fuel in Asia and globally. Stockpiles of gasoline have surged across Asia, with inventories in Singapore, the regional refining hub, rising to a three-month high while Japanese stockpiles also climbed last week. Inventories in the United States are about 7 percent higher than a year ago.     Crude production has soared as well this year. The International Energy Agency expects non-OPEC output alone to rise by 2.3 million barrels per day (bpd) this year while demand next year was expected to grow 1.3 million bpd.  Adjusting to lower demand, top crude exporter Saudi Arabia said on Thursday that it may reduce supply as it pushes OPEC to agree to a joint output cut of 1.4 million bpd. However, Trump has made it clear that he does not want oil prices to rise and many analysts think Saudi Arabia is coming under U.S. pressure to resist calls from other OPEC members for lower crude output. If OPEC decides to cut production at its meeting next month, oil prices could recover, analysts say. “We expect that OPEC will manage the market in 2019 and assess the probability of an agreement to reduce production at around 2-in-3. In that scenario, Brent prices likely recover back into the $70s,” Morgan Stanley commodities strategists Martijn Rats and Amy Sergeant wrote in a note to clients. If OPEC does not trim production, prices could head much lower, potentially depreciating toward $50 a barrel, argues Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM. (Graphic: Global crude oil supply & demand balance - tmsnrt.rs/2PKtzIy) VOLATILITY SPIKES TO 2-YEAR HIGH By the middle of November, commodity trading advisory funds tracked by Credit Suisse prime services had dropped 1.5 percent on the month, owing to the losses in energy futures and the increased volatility. Mark Connors, global head of portfolio and risk advisory at Credit Suisse, told Reuters this week that the action among macro and CTA funds reflects a risk-aversion trade, as net long positions have dropped from near five-year highs to roughly even exposure between longs and shorts.       Hedge funds and other money managers cut their net long positions in Brent by 32,263 contracts to 182,569 in the week ended Nov. 20, according to data provided by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) on Friday. That’s the lowest net long position since December 2015. Volatility, a measure of investor demand for options, has spiked to its highest since late 2016, above 60 percent, as investors have rushed to buy protection against further steep price declines. The decline in oil prices pulled U.S. energy shares lower.  Oil majors Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp fell more than 3 percent and were the leading decliners on the Dow Jones Industrial Average Oilfield service providers Schlumberger NV and Halliburton Co also fell nearly 3 percent.

2018-11-23,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices plunged on Friday on concerns about oversupply, sending world stock markets lower as lagging energy shares weighed down Wall Street. Both Brent and U.S. crude fell to their lowest levels since October 2017 and were on course for their biggest one-month decline since late 2014. Although the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to curb output, rising U.S. oil supply has fuelled persistent concerns about a global surplus. Tumbling oil prices pushed U.S. energy shares down more than 3 percent. As a result, the benchmark S&P 500 stock index ended lower to confirm correction territory, having dropped more than 10 percent from its record closing high in late September. Trading volume was light in a shortened session after the Thanksgiving holiday. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe also fell. Underwhelming economic data from Europe also dimmed market sentiment, investors said. Surveys of German and euro zone purchasing managers came in weaker than expected. “Oil dropped, and some of the numbers from Europe have been a little weak,” said John Carey, managing director and portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. “Today just confirms the recent weakness due to persisting worries about the economy and the effect of higher interest rates on price-to-earnings multiples, borrowing costs and so forth.” Prices of base metals, including nickel and copper, fell sharply on worries of weakening demand in China and a slowdown in global growth as a result of trade tensions between China and the United States. In response to falling oil and U.S. stock prices, benchmark U.S. Treasury yields fell to eight-week lows on Friday as investors moved to safe-haven buying of long-dated U.S. government bonds. The dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, also advanced, up 0.25 percent, in keeping with the theme of declining risk appetite. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 178.74 points, or 0.73 percent, to 24,285.95, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 17.37 points, or 0.66 percent, to 2,632.56 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 33.27 points, or 0.48 percent, to 6,938.98. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 4/32 in price to yield 3.0463 percent, from 3.061 percent late on Wednesday. U.S. stock and bond markets closed early on Friday. They were closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday. U.S. crude CLcv1 dropped $4.21 to settle at $50.42 a barrel, a 7.71 percent decline. Brent LCOcv1 settled $3.80 lower to $58.80 a barrel, down 6.07 percent on the day. The MSCI All-Country World Index .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.52 percent. In contrast to U.S. stocks, European equities rose, led by a rally in Italian stocks .FTMIB as the country's bond yields fell after a press report that EU Affairs Minister Paolo Savona is considering resigning over the government's decision to challenge European Union budget rules. Savona denied the report. The pan-European STOXX 600  index rose 0.4 percent. In currency markets, disappointing survey data from European purchasing managers pushed the euro down 0.7 percent. The pound was down 0.6 percent on concerns over the passage of an agreement for Britain to leave the European Union.

U.S. crude fell 6.26 percent to $51.21 per barrel and Brent was last at $58.87, down 5.96 percent on the day. The MSCI All-Country World Index shed 0.02 percent. In contrast to U.S. stocks, European equities rose, led by a rally in Italian stocks as the country’s bond yields fell after a press report that EU Affairs Minister Paolo Savona is considering resigning over the government’s decision to challenge European Union budget rules. Savona denied the report. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.4 percent. Its gains were capped, however, by weak economic data. Surveys of German and euro zone purchasing managers came in weaker than expected. The disappointing readings pushed the euro down 0.7 percent. Elsewhere in the currency market, the pound was down 0.5 percent on concerns over the passage of an agreement for Britain to leave the European Union. “There is significant weakness in Europe as a whole: everything from French to German data to Brexit talk,” said Bruderman Asset Management’s Pursche.

2018-11-23,"PARIS (Reuters) - Oil and gas major Total will invest heavily in car battery production only if it can compete on a level playing field with Chinese and Asian manufacturers, its chief executive said on Friday. Battery maker Saft, a unit of Total, said in May that it planned to invest more than 200 million euros ($233 million) in a next-generation European battery alliance project to research, develop and build a new generation solid-state battery to compete with Asian and U.S. rivals. Saft’s four-way alliance with Siemens, Solvay and Manz plans to begin mass production of new generation lithium-ion batteries from early 2020, but Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne is concerned that European manufacturers would be operating at a disadvantage to Asian rivals. “I will not launch the group and Saft in operations worth several billion euros if in the end we do not have the fair competitive framework between us and others,” Pouyanne said at a conference in Paris, adding that some Chinese manufacturers benefit from state aid.  Several projects have been announced in recent months to build battery plants in Europe and last week the German government said it had set aside about 1 billion euros to support battery cell production. “Today, if you want to provide an electric vehicle in China with a battery, it must be built in China by a Chinese manufacturer,” Pouyanne said.  “That’s a problem and for now the dialogue we’re having with European governments is to know if we can protect ourselves like that in Europe.” France called on Thursday for European battery manufacturers and carmakers to create a consortium able to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles and compete with dominant Asian producers. Pouyanne said it was out of the question for the sector to replicate what happened in the solar panel industry, where European companies invested heavily only to close down in the face of Chinese competition.

2018-11-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - A small British energy supplier, called Spark Energy Supply Limited, has ceased to trade, regulator Ofgem said on Friday, promising to find a new supplier for customers soon. A number of other small energy providers have gone bust in Britain, prompting Ofgem on Wednesday to propose financial and customer stress tests for energy suppliers wanting to enter the market. On Friday it said the outstanding credit balances of Spark Energy’s 290,000 customers would be protected and there would be no disruption to supplies. It did the same for the 129,000 customers of Extra Energy on Wednesday. A push to increase competitiveness in Britain’s energy market has reduced the market share of the six largest companies to 70 percent from over 95 percent in recent years, with 60 smaller independent companies in operation. However, their rapid rise has led to questions over their viability as, with less capital available to make long-term hedges, some may have been vulnerable to soaring wholesale commodity price rises.

2018-11-23,"BARCELONA, Nov 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Cash from wealthy countries to help the developing world tackle climate change has risen substantially in recent years, putting them on track to meet a politically important 2020 U.N. target to go green and adapt to wild weather, analysts said on Friday. The amount rich nations provided themselves and raised from the private sector in 2016 exceeded $70 billion, according to data in a biennial U.N. assessment. Government funding accounted for about $55 billion, a jump of 30 percent in two years. At U.N. climate talks in 2009, rich countries agreed to raise $100 billion a year by 2020 to back efforts by vulnerable, poorer states to shift their economies onto a greener path and adapt to more extreme weather and rising seas. Analysts said the figures were a positive signal ahead of next month’s U.N. negotiations, tasked with finalising rules to put a global accord to tackle climate change into practice. Joe Thwaites, a researcher at the World Resources Institute, said climate finance was a “critically important part” of the 2015 Paris Agreement, because poorer countries need the money to ramp up efforts to reduce heat-trapping emissions. As of 2016, developed nations appeared to be on track to fulfil their $100 billion pledge, but there are concerns over whether progress has been maintained since then, he added. After Donald Trump took power in 2017, the U.S. president said he would not deliver two-thirds of a $3-billion pledge made by his predecessor to the Green Climate Fund. “Given potential backsliding in the U.S. and Australia, and among some other countries, it’s reasonable to ask was 2016 a high watermark for climate finance?” said Thwaites. Yet funding from international development banks rose 28 percent between 2016 and 2017, and European Union states have maintained their contributions, he added. However, experts said more cash continued to be spent on the push to reduce emissions by boosting renewable energy and energy efficiency rather than on coping with climate change impacts. Adaptation - which includes measures from drought-tolerant crops and higher sea walls to protecting slum dwellers from heat - received only about a quarter of funding, analysts said. “Adaptation finance is still lagging behind and needs to be scaled up, especially considering the rising climate impacts we are seeing,” Helena Wright, a senior policy advisor with think tank E3G, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Globally, climate finance increased 17 percent between 2013-2014 and 2015-2016, reaching $681 billion, the report said. Renewable energy investment dropped by 16 percent in 2016, in part because technology costs fell, but there was an 8 percent rise in investment in energy efficiency and a 35 percent boost for greener transport, according to the U.N. figures. Wright noted that governments continued to provide huge subsidies for the fossil fuel industry - $373 billion in 2015. Those should be phased out to meet political commitments, and to align finance with the Paris pact vision of a low-carbon, climate-resilient world, she added.

2018-11-23,"(Adds comment by source close to South Sudan government, production figures, detail) JUBA, Nov 23 (Reuters) - South Africa will invest $1 billion in South Sudan’s oil sector, including in the construction of a refinery, the South African  minister for energy and his South Sudanese counterpart for petroleum said on Friday. South Sudan’s oil industry is dominated by Asian firms including China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), Malaysia’s Petronas and India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC Videsh). The two ministers signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) which will also involve South Africa taking part in the exploration of several oil blocks, they said. “When this refinery is complete, it will have the capacity of producing 60,000 barrels of oil per day,” Jeff Radebe, the South African minister said without giving further details. A source close to the South Sudanese government however told Reuters that “there is no commitment to build a refinery” beyond the MoU calling for collaboration between the two countries to study the possibility of building it. “What we have signed this morning is the cooperation between our two national oil companies, Nilepet and South Africa Energy Fund then from there the funding will come from Central Energy Fund (CEF) of South Africa,” Ezekiel Lol Gatkuoth, the South Sudanese minister said. The CEF is a holding company whose main asset is South Africa’s national oil and gas agency, PetroSA. Officials from the fund and the South African energy ministry were not immediately available for further comment. Gatkuoth said the deal also offered avenues for cooperation in the construction of a pipeline to serve fields located in the south of the country. South Sudan exports its crude through a pipeline that goes to a port in neighbouring Sudan to the north. “It is instrumental to have a new pipeline,” Gatkuoth said, without giving details on the timeline or potential cost. South Sudan is producing 135,000 barrels per day (bpd) from 130,000 bpd in August, Gatkuoth said this week. The government wants to push production back up to 350,000 bpd, the level achieved in 2011 when the country secured independence from Sudan and before it slid into civil conflict. A peace deal, between President Salva Kiir and rebels led by his former deputy Riek Machar, was signed in September.

2018-11-23,"(Adds details, background, quotes) WARSAW, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Poland’s first nuclear power plant is expected to start operating in 2033 - if the project gets a green light from the government, the Energy Ministry said on Friday. In its draft energy strategy to 2040, a document keenly awaited by market players and analysts, the ministry said the first planned nuclear power plant will have a capacity of 1-1.5 gigawatt (GW). Ultimately the ministry expects Poland to have a total of 6-9 GW of nuclear power by 2043, which will account for around 10 percent of power generation. Poland has considered building a nuclear power plant for years, but the government has yet to take a binding decision on the project. “The nuclear power plant will help us accelerate carbon emissions reduction,” Energy Minister Krzysztof Tchorzewski told a news conference on Friday. Poland plans to reduce carbon emissions by 30 percent by 2030 as compared to 1990, the ministry said. Tchorzewski said in March that a nuclear programme might cost in the region of 70-75 billion zlotys ($18.5-$19.9 billion). With Poland under pressure from the European Union to lessen its reliance on polluting coal, the argument in favour of nuclear has gained in strength as the Energy Ministry concluded it would be the easiest way to reduce emissions. The Energy Ministry reaffirmed that it expects the share of coal in electricity production to fall to 60 percent in 2030 from around 80 percent now. The most polluting lignite coal will almost disappear by 2040 with a growing share of photovoltaic and wind farms. Poland already has onshore wind farms and its first offshore ones are expected to be built after 2025. Generally Poland expects to increase its power production installed capacity to 72.6 GW from 40 GW at the moment in a response to expected growth in power consumption. “This long-awaited document is groundbreaking in many aspects,” said deputy environment minister Michal Kurtyka, who will chair U.N. climate talks in Poland next month. “It is good that is has been published ahead of the climate talks,” Kurtyka added. The energy strategy draft will now be subject to consultations and is expected to be adopted by the government next year.

2018-11-23,"ZURICH (Reuters) - ABB’s (ABBN.S) Power Grids business has signed deals that could be worth around $1.9 billion to supply power transmission equipment to utility companies in China, a person familiar with the situation said. Claudio Facchin, the head of Power Grids, signed memorandums of understanding with Chinese companies including State Grid Corporation of China and China Southern Power Grid earlier this month, the source said. A spokesman for ABB confirmed the agreements, but declined to comment on the financial details.  The agreements will bolster ABB’s Power Grids division as the Swiss engineering group seeks a buyer for the business. The China deal includes digital software and components for high voltage direct current systems used to transmit electricity over long distances, the source said. Deliveries could include components for a 1,200-km (746 miles) high voltage power line between Inner Mongolia and Shandong province.  Reuters reported last week that ABB was in advanced talks with three suitors for the Power Grids division, which could be worth around $11 billion including debt. A source told Reuters this week that Japan’s Hitachi (6501.T) is the front-runner to buy the business.

2018-11-23,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Friday urged the World Trade Organization (WTO) to close loopholes and correct practices by some member states that damage global trade, warning of a “profound crisis” facing the institution’s existence.  China and the United States have clashed about how the WTO should reform to better serve member interests, amid a widening trade dispute that has triggered billions in retaliatory tariffs and rocked global markets. Members of the G20 are expected to discuss WTO reform when they meet at a summit in Argentina next week, following a failed attempt to reach agreement on the topic at an APEC forum held last week in Papua New Guinea. Debate on reforming the WTO has been largely driven by U.S. complaints that it has failed to police suspected Chinese rule-breaking, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening a withdrawal to protect American interests. The United States wants the WTO to crack down on China’s subsidies for state-owned enterprises (SOE), overcapacity in steel and other basic industries, and on the practice of forcing investors to hand over valuable technology. At a news conference on Friday, China’s Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen unveiled a list of detailed demand and principles to clarify China’s stance that reform should uphold core WTO values, ensure fairness and protect developing countries’ interests.     He took aim at what he called “excessive” agriculture subsidies enjoyed exclusively by developed countries, saying some member states had exploited loopholes in the WTO system. Reforms should correct some countries’ discrimination against investments by other countries and companies, and not be used as a way to deprive China of the right to enjoy differentiated treatment as a developing country, Wang said, without naming any countries.  “Some countries are in reality just hoping to uphold their monopoly status and restrict other member states’ development,” he said. Referring to state-owned enterprises (SOEs), he said China opposed groundless criticism of “normal SOE and industrial subsidies” and “normal sharing of technological innovations”. Wang added the WTO should try to resolve a deadlock in appointments to its Appellate Body, which have been blocked by the United States which blames the dispute settlement body’s judges for hampering a U.S. campaign against what it sees as unfair trade practices. China’s ambassador to the WTO, Zhang Xiangchen, said this week that China would not have views forced upon it as he warned fellow WTO members against seeing reform as a chance to put China in a straitjacket. “The WTO should prioritize key issues that threaten the institution’s existence,” Wang said.

Italian stocks led the bounce in equities, rallying hard after the country’s bond yields fell after a press report that EU Affairs Minister Paolo Savona is considering resigning over the government’s decision to challenge European Union budget rules. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.1 percent. Europe’s performance on Friday stood in contrast to Asia, where steep losses in Chinese markets hit stocks amid lingering trade war tensions and worries about global growth. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.2 percent as Chinese blue-chips tumbled 2 percent and the Shanghai Composite index lost 2.2 percent. Not all was cheerful in Europe though - surveys of German and euro zone purchasing managers came in weaker than expected, pushing the euro to its lowest in three days and setting up the single currency for its worst week in a month. The disappointing readings will likely be of concern to policymakers at the European Central Bank, who are expected to draw a line under their 2.6 trillion euro asset purchase programme at the end of the year. “The key message from the PMI data is that it has raised doubts about whether the economy will rebound after Q3 weakness, so there’s no wonder the news has been taken badly by the market,” said Jack Allen, senior European economist at Capital Economics in London. “The big picture is that the data is not bad enough for the ECB to not end asset purchases at the end of the year. But if growth fails to rebound, they (ECB policymakers) will have to think twice about raising rates next year.” Purchasing manager indexes from the United States, due at 1425 GMT, will be watched for a reading on where global growth is headed. The MSCI All-Country World Index of stocks was down 0.1 percent on the day, and set for a second week in the red. U.S. equity futures were pointing to weakness on Wall Street when trading resumes Friday. S&P E-mini futures were down half a percent. On Thursday, stock markets in Europe were hit by disappointing earnings, underscoring the lingering anxiety among equity investors as trade tensions, slowing global investment and growth. A draft deal between Britain and the European Union on future relations reached on Thursday did little to lighten the mood. Daiwa analyst Chris Scicluna said: “Asian equity indices have largely picked up the baton of negativity from European markets yesterday.” He noted investor apprehension was high before next week’s Buenos Aires bilateral meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, and added: “Following VP Pence’s tough rhetoric at the APEC summit, making it clear that the Trump administration is in no hurry to end the trade war and calling on China to change its ways, that’s perhaps no surprise.” In the currency market, the pound was down 0.3 percent, buying $1.2830 after rising more than 1 percent on the news of the draft agreement between Britain and the EU, which describes a close post-Brexit relationship. The agreement follows a draft treaty last week that set the terms for Britain’s departure from the EU in March. The dollar weakened 0.1 percent against the yen to 112.84 . Against a basket of currencies, the greenback was higher 0.13 percent. China’s yuan fell to 6.9498 per dollar, with trade concerns weighing. The currency has also come under pressure in recent weeks in sympathy with falling Chinese rates, with yields on shorter-term Chinese government bonds below their U.S. counterparts. In commodities markets, oil prices fell to their lowest in a year, on course for their biggest one-month decline since late 2014, even as oil producers consider cutting production to try to stem a rising global surplus. U.S. crude was trading down 4.4 percent at $52.23 while Brent crude futures were last down 2.5 percent at $61.05 a barrel. Spot gold was down 0.4 percent at $1,222.33 per ounce.

2018-11-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Banks Mining has won a high court challenge to the government’s decision to reject its application to develop a new coal mine in northeastern England, the company said on Friday. Northumberland County Council agreed last year that the mine’s developer, Banks Mining, a division of The Banks Group, could extract 3 million tonnes of coal by cutting an open cast, or surface, mine near Druridge Bay, Highthorn. But the local government minister at the time, Sajid Javid, rejected the application in March following a public inquiry, saying the proposal could hamper the country’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb climate change. Banks Mining challenged the decision and on Friday said it had been successful in Britain’s High Court, which quashed the government’s rejection of the plan on the grounds that the minister did not provide adequate evidence for his decision. The application will now go back to the government, and the current local government minister James Brokenshire, for further consideration. “Banks Mining is urging the present incumbent... to permit the company to progress its significant investment and job creation plans as soon as possible,” the company said in a statement. Environmentalists had criticised the plans, saying the mine would destroy an area of natural beauty and that extracting more coal is at odds with international pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris climate pact. Supporters of the project had said it could bring much-needed jobs to the region, and help to reduce Britain’s reliance on coal imports. Banks said the project would create at least 100 well-paid full-time jobs. Britain plans to close all coal-fired power stations by 2025 unless they are fitted with technology to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions, as part of efforts to cut greenhouse gases by 80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050. Britain’s energy mister Claire Perry has also spearheaded an international campaign to phase out coal fired power plants across the globe.

Purchasing manager indexes from the United States, due later in the day, will be watched for a reading on where global growth is headed. The MSCI All-Country World Index of stocks was down 0.03 percent on the day, and set for a second week in the red. U.S. equity futures were pointing to weakness on Wall Street when trading resumes Friday. S&P E-mini futures were down 0.2 percent. On Thursday, stock markets in Europe were hit by disappointing earnings on further signs that corporate profit growth is peaking globally. Those earnings underscored the lingering anxiety among equity investors as trade tensions, slowing global investment and growth kept stock markets on the back foot after a difficult October. A draft deal between Britain and the European Union on future relations reached on Thursday did little to lighten the mood. Daiwa analyst Chris Scicluna said: “Asian equity indices have largely picked up the baton of negativity from European markets yesterday.” He noted investor apprehension was high before next week’s Buenos Aires bilateral between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, and added: “Following VP Pence’s tough rhetoric at the APEC summit, making it clear that the Trump administration is in no hurry to end the trade war and calling on China to change its ways, that’s perhaps no surprise.” In the currency market, the pound was down 0.2 percent, buying $1.2844 after rising more than 1 percent on the news of the draft agreement between Britain and the EU, which describes a close post-Brexit relationship. The agreement follows a draft treaty last week that set the terms for Britain’s departure from the EU in March. But the deal faces a rocky ride once it reaches a deeply divided British parliament containing hardline eurosceptic and staunch pro-EU factions, and various shades of grey in-between. The dollar weakened 0.08 percent against the yen to 112.84 . Against a basket of currencies, the greenback was down 0.04 percent. China’s yuan fell to 6.9498 per dollar, with trade concerns weighing. The currency has also come under pressure in recent weeks in sympathy with falling Chinese rates, with yields on shorter-term Chinese government bonds below their U.S. counterparts. In commodities markets, oil prices fell to their lowest since late 2017 in choppy trading, weighed down by an emerging crude supply overhang and a darkening economic outlook. U.S. crude was trading down 2.2 percent at $53.43 after coming within 5 cents of an October 2017 low reached earlier in the week. Brent crude futures were last down 0.7 percent at $62.12 a barrel. Spot gold was down 0.3 percent at $1,223.24 per ounce.

2018-11-23,"Nov 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Friday will issue a new report detailing the threat climate change poses to the economy, in what is expected to be a dire warning at odds with the Trump administration’s pro-fossil fuels agenda. The congressionally mandated report, written with the help of more than a dozen U.S. government agencies and departments, will supplement a study issued last year that concluded humans are the main driver of global warming, and warned of potentially catastrophic effects to the planet. “It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century,” according to that report. “There is no convincing alternative explanation ...” This year’s report is expected to detail costs of climate change and provide scientific assessments of the risks and the extent to which people can adapt to it. The report is expected clash with policy under President Donald Trump, who has been rolling back environmental and climate protections to maximize production of domestic fossil fuels, including crude oil, already the highest in the world above Saudi Arabia and Russia. Trump last year announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris Deal agreed by nearly 200 nations to combat climate change, arguing the accord would hurt the U.S. economy and provide little tangible environmental benefit. Under the Paris pact’s rules, however, Trump can not officially withdraw from the agreement until after the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The U.S. government still sends delegations to U.N. climate negotiations. Trump and several members of his cabinet have also repeatedly cast doubt on the science of climate change, saying the causes are not yet settled. That is despite the fact an overwhelming majority of climate scientists around the globe agree that the burning of fossil fuels drives global warming, and is leading to rising seas, flooding, droughts, and more frequent powerful storms. Previous research, including from U.S. government scientists, has concluded that climate change could have severe economic consequences, including damage to infrastructure, water supplies and agriculture. Severe weather and other impacts also increase the risk of disease transmission, decrease air quality, and can increase mental health problems, among other effects, according to U.S. and international studies. Thirteen government departments and agencies, from the Agriculture Department to NASA, were part of the committee that compiled the new report.

2018-11-23,"(Updates with analyst comment) KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Malaysia will increase the minimum bio-content local producers must add to its biodiesel fuel for certain sectors to 10 percent from 7 percent starting on Dec. 1. Primary Industries Minister Teresa Kok said in a radio interview with national news agency Bernama on Wednesday that the government had given the approval to implement the so-called B10 biodiesel mandate. “The cabinet has approved the use of B10 and it will be implemented from December 1. We also have the agreement from the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers that the industrial sector will use B7,” she said in the interview which was posted to Bernama Radio’s Facebook page. Fuel stations in Malaysia currently use B7 biofuel. Kok said with these measures, the use of palm oil locally was expected to double, without elaborating. The B10 biodiesel programme will be implemented in the transport sector and other subsidised sectors in stages and will be mandatory from February 2019, Bloomberg News said on Thursday citing a letter from the Primary Industries Ministry to petroleum companies. CIMB Research analyst Ivy Ng said the move would be positive for the palm oil market on expectations of increased consumption for biodiesel purpose in Malaysia. “This could help reduce current high palm oil stock levels over time,” Ng said. Inventories in Indonesia and Malaysia, the top producers of the tropical oil, are expected to rise in the next two months on slower demand from key buyers in winter months as palm oil solidifies.

Kenya’s main power distributor said it increased its bad debt provisions seven-fold to 6.08 billion shillings ($59 million) in the financial year that ended June 30 after it adopted a new accounting standard. Its shares fell nearly 6 percent after its full-year results on Friday. Its performance was also hurt by rising costs linked to its growing transmission and distribution network, and higher financing costs that offset modest electricity sales. The state-controlled company will now make provisions for debts due for longer than 30 days, down from its previous practice of providing for debt that is due for longer than 58 days, said acting CEO Jared Othieno. “We are going to engage in a more aggressive collection policy, where we are not only going to start collecting those which are due, but also internally,” Othieno told reporters. “We are going to ensure that the moment we bill you, then we shall come for our debt.” Kenya Power faced a crisis in July after its chief executive and several senior executives were arrested and charged with a conspiracy to commit economic crimes and abuse of office. The company delayed the issuance of its financial results and issued a profit warning at the time. “It had an impact... in trying to ensure that the succession plan that was in place was able to bring out the skills that were required,” said Othieno, adding the company had recovered from that phase. It has begun the search for a new CEO. Its shares were down 5.6 percent at 3.40 shillings by 1129 GMT and have now lost 48 percent since the arrest of its CEO in July. The company has more than 6.8 million customers connected to its grid, and says it gets about 60 percent of its revenue from industrial consumers in Nairobi and the neighbouring town of Thika.

2018-11-23,"(Adds details, background) KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Malaysia’s Petronas said on Friday production at the Kebabangan gas field in the eastern state of Sabah was expected to return to full capacity by August 2019 following disruption caused by a gas leak at an associated pipeline. The problem was caused by a leak from the Sabah Sarawak Gas Pipeline in January, the state energy firm said in an emailed statement to Reuters. Repair works on the pipeline have been completed, and integrity assurance tests being conducted on the 500-kilometre pipeline are expected to be finished by July 2019, it said. “The supply disruption, however, did not impact our LNG (liquefied natural gas) cargo deliveries to customers,” Petronas said. Last week, Malaysia’s finance minister said the country’s economic growth was impacted by supply disruption at the Kebabangan gas field. Gas exports have been severely impacted since the second quarter, he said. Malaysia is the world’s third-biggest exporter of LNG, and Petronas is a significant contributor to state coffers. The country’s economy grew at its slowest in two years in the July-September quarter, in part because of “supply shocks” in the LNG sector. Growth in the prior quarter had also been hit by supply disruptions. Reuters reported in August that Malaysia’s exports of LNG fell to a four-year low in July as domestic gas pipeline issues since January took their toll. Recent trade data showed Malaysia’s third-quarter LNG exports totalled 8.7 billion ringgit ($2.1 billion) in value, down about 21 percent from the same period last year. $1 = 4.1920 ringgit

2018-11-23,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A German court has ruled Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) must reimburse the owner of a Golf the full original price of his vehicle bought in 2012, dealing a blow to the carmaker as the legal battles over its emissions cheating scandal drag on. Volkswagen (VW) said it believed the court in Augsburg had misapplied the law and that it would appeal the ruling at the higher regional court. The Augsburg civil court ruled on Nov. 14th that VW had acted immorally by deliberately installing emissions-cheating software to increase sales and profits, a spokesman for the court said on Friday. The court ordered VW to repay the owner the original price of almost 30,000 euros ($34,200), according to a copy of the ruling. “In our opinion, there is no legal basis for customer complaints. Customers have suffered neither losses nor damages. The vehicles are safe and roadworthy,” VW said in a statement. It added that around 9,000 judgements had been issued in connection with its diesel emissions scandal, which came to light in 2015, and the majority of customer complaints had been unsuccessful at district and higher courts. “The decision of the district court in Augsburg thereby stands in contradiction to multiple decisions of other courts in comparable cases,” VW said. Its shares were little changed at 151.88 euros at 0844 GMT. VW has said about 11 million diesel cars worldwide were fitted with software that could cheat emissions tests designed to limit noxious car fumes. The German carmaker has agreed to pay billions of dollars in the United States to settle claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers. It offered to buy back 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles.

2018-11-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP has started production at the Clair Ridge oil field in the West of Shetlands region of the North Sea, targeting a peak output of 120,000 barrels per day, it said on Friday. The Clair Ridge project is the second phase of the Clair field, located 75 km (47 miles) west of Shetlands. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS), Chevron (CVX.N) and ConocoPhillips CON.N also hold stakes in the field. In addition to two bridge-linked platforms, the Clair Ridge project included a new oil and gas pipeline tying it to the Clair export pipeline, which delivers oil to the onshore Sullom Voe terminal, BP said in a statement. Clair was first discovered in 1977 and is one of a number of big developments in the West of Shetland area, where other oil companies are investing.   The new project is designed to recover 640 million barrels of oil. Clair Ridge is BP’s sixth major project start-up in 2018, after starting up seven in 2017. All these projects will boost the London-based company’s output by 900,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021. British Energy Minister Claire Perry said in a statement that Clair Ridge was vital for the country’s energy security. “Aided by the innovative use of technology developed in the UK and a strong UK-based supply chain worth £1.5 billion, this will allow the North Sea to continue to be a hub for the high-skilled, well-paid jobs at the centre of our modern Industrial Strategy.” Reporting by Ron Bousso; Editing by Edmund Blair and Emelia Sithole-Matarise",https://uk.reuters.com/article/bp-clairridge/update-1-bp-starts-production-at-clair-ridge-field-in-north-sea-idUKL8N1XY1IX,23 Nov 2018,"BP has started production at the

2018-11-23,"* Oct gasoline exports drop 33 pct from year earlier * Oct diesel exports rise 19 pct from year earlier * Oct jet-kero exports rise 23 pct from year earlier BEIJING, Nov 23 (Reuters) - China’s gasoline exports in October fell to their lowest in 13 months amid a glut of the fuel in Asia and globally, customs data showed on Friday. Gasoline exports last month were 650,000 tonnes, the lowest since September 2017 and 33 percent lower than a year ago, data from the General Administration of Customs showed. Stockpiles of gasoline have surged across Asia, with inventories in Singapore, the regional refining hub, rising to a three-month high while Japanese stockpiles also climbed last week. Inventories in the United States are about 7 percent higher than a year ago. Demand for middle distillates in Asia, however, remains strong, accounting for a surge in China’s diesel and kerosene exports last month. October diesel exports were 1.44 million tonnes, up nearly 40 percent from September and 19 percent higher than the 1.209 million tonnes a year earlier, the customs data showed. Exports of jet-kerosene rose to 1.19 million tonnes, up from September’s 990,000 tonnes and 970,000 tonnes in October 2017. China’s overall refined fuel exports in October rose 7.8 percent from a year earlier. The stronger overseas sales also followed the government issuing nearly 3 million tonnes of additional fuel export quotas in late October, more than half of which are for jet fuel. These new quotas — all to state oil firms — would take China’s total fuel export quotas to around 46 million tonnes, compared to 43 million for 2017, as refiners wanted to bolster domestic margins by thinning the supply pool amid an expanding surplus. Imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) rose to 4.6 million tonnes last month, up from 4.37 million tonnes the previous month and 3.57 million tonnes a year earlier, ahead of the heating season when demand for the fuel rises, the customs data showed.

2018-11-23,"* MSCI Asia ex-Japan drops 0.2 pct * European markets seen opening higher * Pound retains gains after draft deal on future EU-UK relations * Crude prices continue plunge on oversupply concerns * Japan markets closed for a holiday By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Steep losses in Chinese share markets dented Asian equities on Friday as lingering trade war tensions and weak corporate earnings in Europe added to worries about global growth. With U.S. markets closed overnight for Thanksgiving and Japan on holiday on Friday, early trading lacked direction until the sell-off in China brought on more pain for stock investors in the region. Shares in Europe, in contrast, are expected to rise Friday. Financial spreadbetters expect London’s FTSE, Frankfurt’s DAX and Paris’ CAC to advance 0.3 percent each. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.23 percent as Chinese blue-chips tumbled 2 percent and the Shanghai Composite index lost 2.2 percent. China’s markets have been mired in a slump as the country’s trade war with the United States has exacerbated worries about slowing growth. Few analysts expect sustained improvement for Chinese shares even if U.S. and Chinese leaders make progress in mending ties at a G20 meeting in Argentina at the end of the month. At this stage, some economists doubt the G20 talks will bring progress. Prakash Sakpal of ING in Singapore said there “haven’t been any promising developments” since the trade war started. “There is a lot of rhetoric driving things farther from any sort of solid consensus that both countries could come around.” Seoul’s Kospi ended 0.6 percent lower and Taiwan shares lost 0.5 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 0.6 percent in afternoon trade. Australian shares held on to gains, rising 0.4 percent, but posted their second straight weekly loss. U.S. equity futures were pointing to weakness on Wall Street when trading resumes Friday. S&P E-mini futures were down 0.5 percent at 2,636. On Thursday, stock markets in Europe were hit by disappointing earnings on further signs that corporate profit growth is peaking globally. Those earnings underscored the lingering anxiety among equity investors as trade tensions, slowing global investment and growth kept stock markets on the back foot after a torrid October. A draft deal between Britain and the European Union on future relations reached late Thursday did little to lighten the mood. In the currency market, the pound was flat, buying $1.2875 after rising more than 1 percent on Thursday on news of the draft agreement between Britain and the EU, which describes a close post-Brexit relationship. The agreement follows a draft treaty last week that set the terms for Britain’s departure from the EU in March. But the deal faces a rocky ride once it reaches a deeply divided British parliament containing hardline eurosceptic and staunch pro-EU factions, and various shades of grey in-between. Indeed, analysts at National Australia Bank cautioned against early celebrations. “After EU leaders are expected to rubber stamp this political declaration alongside the withdrawal agreement at a summit on Sunday, the ‘meaningful vote’ in the UK Parliament is likely in the second week in December. It would be far too optimistic to declare victory on a deal yet,” they said in a note to clients. The euro edged up to $1.1413, despite statements by Italy’s leaders that they would press ahead with expanding the country’s deficit next year and resist pressure from EU authorities to trim its budget, as investors focus on conciliatory rather than confrontational comments. The dollar weakened 0.08 percent against the yen to 112.84 . China’s yuan fell to 6.9386 per dollar, with trade concerns weighing. The currency has also come under pressure in recent weeks in sympathy with falling Chinese rates, with yields on shorter-term Chinese government bonds below their U.S. counterparts. In commodities markets, oil prices hit 2018 lows as U.S. inventories rose to their highest level since December, adding to concerns about a global crude glut. U.S. crude was trading down 2.5 percent at $53.24 after coming within 5 cents of an October 2017 low reached earlier in the week. Brent crude futures hit their lowest since December 2017 at $61.52 per barrel, and were last down 1.2 percent at $61.85 a barrel. Spot gold was flat at $1,227.17 per ounce.

2018-11-23,"* Tumbles to more than three-month low * Traders hope for cold winter to soak up supply * Tankers still floating LNG in Asia By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) tumbled nearly 10 percent this week to a more than three-month low, knocked lower by a slide in oil prices, forecasts for a warmer than average winter and ample supply onshore and in tankers. Spot prices for January delivery in North Asia LNG-AS were estimated at $10 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), 90 cents lower than last week, according to traders. “The big question mark right now is how the weather will pan out as the market will quickly turn once it starts to get cold. But until then, it’s tank-top right now in many places,” said a Singapore-based LNG trader, referring to high storage levels of natural gas in North Asia. Temperatures in major cities Tokyo, Beijing and Shanghai in the world’s top two LNG buyers, Japan and China, are expected to be warmer than usual next week, weather data from Refinitiv Eikon showed. Demand from end-users in North Asia remained muted while a big drop in Brent oil prices was causing jitters in the LNG market, trade sources said. Oil prices slumped to 2018 lows on Friday, pulled down by concerns of an emerging global supply overhang amid a bleak economic outlook. “Typically, changes in Brent tend to have a bigger impact on Asian LNG prices due to lack of liquidity in Asian gas derivatives,” said a second Singapore-based LNG trader. Trading remained thin in the region with several LNG tankers still floating the super-chilled fuel around Asia. But the situation may soon stabilise as end-users have stopped reselling cargoes, the trader said. “The Chinese are not reselling cargoes like they were doing recently, so I think situation could be bottoming out,” the trader added. In tenders, India’s GSPC is seeking two cargoes for delivery in December, while Gail India may be offering to sell a December-loading cargo from Cove Point in the United States, traders said. The Indian importer has 20-year deals to buy 5.8 million tonnes per year of U.S. LNG in total, split between Dominion Energy’s Cove Point plant and Cheniere Energy’s Sabine Pass. Angola LNG offered a cargo for December, but the results were not immediately clear. An LNG tanker was transferring a cargo of Russia’s Yamal LNG to another vessel off the tip of northern Norway on Thursday, the first such operation that will help the facility raise production.

2018-11-23,"HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam’s ongoing coffee harvest and offshore oil exploration are under threat from tropical storm Usagi, which is headed from the South China Sea toward the Southeast Asian country’s coffee-growing region of the Central Highlands. Vietnam’s long coastline makes it prone to destructive tropical storms. Natural disasters such as floods and landslides triggered by storms killed 389 people in the country last year. At least 19 people were killed by a tropical storm last week in the southern resort city of Nha Trang. “(Usagi) will start hitting our operational oil and gas blocks off the central and southern coast and all units must keep vigilant as the storm develops,” state-run Vietnam Oil and Gas Group, known as PetroVietnam, said in a statement on Friday. With sustained wind speeds of up to 100 km per hour (62 miles per hour), the storm will dump up to 500mm (19.7 inches) of rain in coastal areas stretching from the central city of Hue, to the southern province of Binh Thuan and the Central Highlands, the National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said on Friday. The Central Highlands is Vietnam’s largest coffee growing area, where the harvest of the 2018/19 crop year is underway.  “We are concerned that the heavy rains triggered by the storm will disrupt the coffee harvest,” said Nguyen Viet Vinh, General Secretary of the Vietnam Coffee and Cocoa Association. Traders estimate that farmers have harvested nearly 40 percent of the beans and that the harvest will end in late December. Vietnam’s government said on Friday it had ordered local authorities to get ready to evacuate people from areas prone to floods and landslides and instructed boats to find shelter.  Usagi, known in Vietnam as “Storm No. 9”, is forecast to weaken to a tropical low pressure system as it hits the southeastern coast of Vietnam on Saturday night, with sustained wind speeds of 60 kph, the meteorological agency said.

2018-11-23,"NEW DELHI/LONDON (Reuters) - Russian-backed Indian refiner Nayara Energy is set to secure its biggest fuel-backed loan, a $1.5 billion advance from Trafigura, BP (BP.L) and some banks, according to industry and banking sources familiar with the matter. It takes the total size of Nayara’s pre-payment deals to nearly $3 billion (2.3 billion pounds) despite concerns over U.S. sanctions. The company, previously owned by the debt-laden Essar Group, is gradually raising its profile on India’s energy map. It is scouting to secure its future revenue streams by locking in export financing deals. Trafigura and oil major BP are in the process of syndicating a $1.5 billion loan to be repaid with future gasoline and gasoil cargoes from the refinery over four years, the sources said. The syndication is expected to be completed before the end of the year, they said. Nayara, formerly Essar Oil, was taken over by a consortium led by Russian oil major Rosneft in 2017. Rosneft owns 49.13 percent of Nayara, while Russian fund UCP and Swiss commodities trader Trafigura together own a similar share. In last year’s deal, the consortium acquired the 400,000 barrel-per-day refinery in Vadinar as well as a port, power plant and 3,500 fuel stations for nearly $13 billion. Since then Nayara has expanded its retail fuel network to about 4,500 stations and has set a target of reaching 7,000 in three years, its chairman, B. Anand, said in September. Nayara previously depended on close to 30 Indian banks for its financing, adding foreign exchange costs as it would have to buy crude in dollars using Indian rupees - an untenable and expensive proposition. Pre-payment deals are a normal mechanism to raise funds but Western banks were initially hesitant to participate in Nayara’s deals due to the Russian companies’ stakes in it and the refiner’s reliance on Iranian and Venezuelan oil. Russia has been under U.S. and EU sanctions since 2014 when it occupied Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula and Rosneft is under limited sanctions. Washington re-imposed sanctions on Iranian oil in early November and the Trump administration has weighed restrictions on Venezuelan oil. Nayara’s previous ownership under debt-ridden conglomerate Essar Group added to the qualms. However, a banking source said that Nayara’s intention to stop buying Iranian oil and a company name change improved the compliance outlook for the bank. For the current $1.5 billion deal, BP, Trafigura and bankers involved will float a special purpose vehicle while for the previous such transactions that mandate was directly given to the buyers.    Trafigura declined to comment. BP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Asked for comment on the fuel-backed loan, Nayara said in a statement sent to Reuters that its improved financial performance and credit rating over the last year had attracted more interest in working with the company.  “This transformation of the company in the last one year has resulted in substantial interest from the top global and domestic banks who wish to partner with the company,” Anup Vikal, Nayara’s chief financial officer, said.  “As a part of this drive towards further efficiency and global interest we are constantly evaluating multiple opportunities including export advance as the company moves into the new era.” Deutsche Bank and ABN Amro are among the foreign banks involved, the sources said. The banks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The new deal would bring Nayara’s total pre-payment transactions during the year to nearly $3 billion.  Trafigura and BP have already completed two similar deals. Syndication of a $1 billion prepayment, first reported by Reuters early this year, was finalised in September for a lower amount of $750 million over 15 months, one of the sources said. Another $700 million over 8 months began in March.

2018-11-23,"(Repeats Nov 22 column without change. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chart: tmsnrt.rs/2RbO1i4 By John Kemp LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has in effect agreed to overlook the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in return for Saudi Arabia’s help to contain oil prices and for its assistance in other areas. The United States and Britain have seized on the vulnerability of the kingdom and its de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman to push harder for a partial ceasefire in Yemen and improve relations with Qatar. The kingdom will also come under heightened pressure to deliver on promises of increased arms purchases and overseas investment as well as reconstruction aid in Yemen. Khashoggi’s killing inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month has also given the United States leverage over the Saudi government and, by extension, the production policy pursued by the OPEC+ group of oil exporters. Oil traders have certainly made a link between the killing and oil. Khashoggi was killed on Oct. 2. Brent futures hit their highest level in the current cycle on Oct. 3 and have since fallen by more than $23 a barrel (tmsnrt.rs/2RbO1i4). Several other factors, too, have weighed on oil prices since the end of September. These include rising production by OPEC and its allies, surging U.S. shale output, more generous than expected waivers for Iran’s exports, a deteriorating economic outlook and hedge fund selling. But there is little doubt the Khashoggi killing has weakened the kingdom’s international position and made it more anxious to maintain support from the White House, which has included delivering higher oil output and lower prices. The White House itself has drawn an explicit link between the killing and Saudi Arabia’s posture on oil prices (“Statement from President Donald J Trump on Standing with Saudi Arabia”, White House, Nov. 20). Explaining why the president continues to give his full support to the kingdom, the White House cited its help in confronting Iran, agreeing to invest in the United States and arms sales. The official statement also highlighted Saudi Arabia’s importance as one of the world’s largest oil producers and praised the kingdom for working closely with the president to keep a lid on prices. “They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels – so important for the world,” the president said in his statement. The president subsequently commended Saudi Arabia on Twitter, writing on Nov. 21: “Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World ... Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let’s go lower.” The president’s praise for Saudi Arabia marked a significant shift from his repeated criticism of OPEC this year for pushing prices higher. Trump’s comments on Twitter and television since the start of the year have made it clear he wants Brent prices well below $80 a barrel and perhaps below $70. Saudi Arabia is now much less able to resist such pressure. The United States has always been one of the world’s largest oil producers as well as its largest consumer, with the result that presidents tend to favour “moderate” oil prices. High prices penalise U.S. motorists while low prices threaten the viability of the oil industry in politically and economically important states such as Texas. High prices hurt consumers and energy-intensive manufacturers, but low prices threaten oil and gas investment as well as business activity throughout the industry’s supply chain, including steelmakers, railroads and trucking firms. The shale revolution has more than doubled U.S. oil production since 2008 but it has not altered the fundamental political and economic logic. Trump seems to have calculated, probably correctly, that lower rather than higher oil prices are important if he is to be re-elected in 2020. Motorists and energy-intensive manufacturers far outnumber voters employed in the oil and gas industry and its supply chain. Moreover, most U.S. oil production is concentrated in states that already lean heavily towards his own Republican Party and are likely to vote for him again (including Texas, North Dakota, Alaska and Oklahoma). By contrast, the swing states he needs to assemble a majority in the electoral college are dominated by oil consumers (including Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida). The White House also calculates that lower oil prices will stimulate consumer spending and provide a late-cycle boost to the economy, growth and jobs. Provided prices fall moderately and do not slump, the boost to consumption will more than offset the hit to investment within the oil and gas sector and its supply chain. Domestic oil and gas producers may not be happy with the president’s advocacy for lower prices, but they are unlikely to support the Democratic Party’s nominee in 2020. In electoral politics, oil and gas producers have nowhere else to go - leaving the president free to concentrate on winning support from oil consumers in swing states. Trump’s marginal voter in 2020 will be an oil consumer rather than an oil producer. The president’s preferred oil price to maximise his chances of re-election is somewhat lower than Saudi Arabia appeared to be comfortable with a few months ago. But he has sent a clear message to OPEC+ in general, and Saudi Arabia in particular, about what he wants in terms of oil market management strategy and prices. The White House expects Saudi Arabia to ensure prices do not spike again in the months ahead in exchange for its continued support, and the president is not known for his patience. Saudi Arabia and its allies may still trim production in 2019 to avoid a renewed glut in the oil market, but the cuts are likely to be smaller than if Khashoggi had not been killed.

2018-11-23,"* U.S., Russian & Saudi oil production: tmsnrt.rs/2Rua0R8 By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday, weighed down by concerns that producers are churning out more oil than the world needs amid a bleak economic outlook. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures, were at $53.83 per barrel at 0029 GMT, 80 cents, or 1.5 percent below their last settlement. Front-month Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. “Oil prices fell as concerns of further oversupply drove sentiment lower,” ANZ bank said on Friday. Oil supply has surged this year, with the top-three producers of the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia pumping out more than a third of global consumption, which stands around 100 million barrels per day (bpd). High production comes as the demand outlook weakens on the back of a global economic slowdown. As a result, oil prices have plunged by around 30 percent since their last peaks in early October. Adjusting to lower demand, top crude exporter Saudi Arabia said on Thursday that it may reduce supply. “We will not sell oil that customers don’t need,” Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said. Saudi Arabia is the de-facto leader of the producer cartel of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which is discussing to cut oil supply by as much as 1.4 million bpd to prevent a supply glut.

2018-11-23,"PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump warned on Thursday there could be a government shutdown next month over security on the border with Mexico, suggesting he could hold up a funding deal if no more money is provided for a wall between the two countries.  “Could there be a shut down? There certainly could and it will be about border security, of which the wall is a part,” Trump told reporters in Palm Beach, Florida.  The U.S. Congress faces a deadline next month to fund parts of the federal government and a possible showdown over money for Trump’s proposed border wall. Having won control of the House in midterm elections, Democrats have said they will be even less motivated than before to meet Trump’s wall demands. Trump also said he had given the military the authorization to use lethal force if necessary on the border with Mexico. “If they have to they are going to use lethal force. I’ve given the OK - I hope they don’t have to.” Trump also warned that the United States could close the whole border with Mexico for a period of time “if we find that it gets to a level where we are going to lose control or our people are going to start getting hurt.” This would mean “Mexico will not be able to sell their cars into the United States,” added Trump, who has complained about the number of cars U.S. manufacturers produce in Mexico. Vehicle exports from Mexico to the United States in 2017 totalled 2.3 million units. Later on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that he had been in close contact with Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray.  “We have affirmed our shared commitment to addressing the current challenge. The caravans will not be permitted to enter the United States,” he said in a State Department statement.  Ahead of U.S. congressional elections earlier this month, Trump denounced the approach of a caravan of migrants as an “invasion” that threatened American national security, and he sent thousands of U.S. troops to the border to help secure it. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Wednesday that he had been granted authority to allow troops on the Mexican border greater powers to help protect border officials, and would await direction from the Department of Homeland Security. Mattis said troops could help protect the border agents with shields and batons, but would be unarmed. Two U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters this week a memo signed by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly gave Mattis the authority to protect immigration agents and if necessary, could include actions like use of lethal force, crowd control, temporary detention and cursory searches. Trump has issued ultimatums about wall funding before, with little impact, even with his own Republican Party in majority control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. If the two parties cannot reach a funding deal, there would be a partial government shutdown, with so-called “essential services,” including some at the Department of Homeland Security, likely remaining in operation.

2018-11-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - Spraying sun-dimming chemicals high above the Earth to slow global warming could be “remarkably inexpensive”, costing about $2.25 billion a year over a 15-year period, according to a study by U.S. scientists. Some researchers say the geo-engineering technique known as stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) could limit rising temperatures that are causing climate change. As yet unproven and hypothetical, it would involve the use of huge hoses, cannons or specially designed aircraft to spray large quantities of sulphate particles into the upper layer of the atmosphere to act as a reflective barrier against sunlight. Total costs to launch a hypothetical SAI effort 15 years from now would be $3.5 billion, scientists at Harvard University said in a report published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, adding that average annual operating costs would be about $2.25 billion a year over 15 years. Discounting other methods of deployment because of cost and feasibility, the research assumes a special aircraft can be designed to fly at an altitude of about 20km and carry a load of 25 tonnes. After direct input from several aerospace and engine companies, the scientists said they have developed a design that could be suitable and could be ready to be deployed in 15 years, aiming to cut the rate of temperature change in half. The scientists emphasised that this is merely a hypothetical scenario.  “We make no judgment about the desirability of SAI. We simply show that a hypothetical deployment programme commencing 15 years hence, while both highly uncertain and ambitious, would indeed be technically possible from an engineering perspective. It would also be remarkably inexpensive,” the report said. There are risks to such unproven potential technologies. Scientists have said SAI could result in negative consequences such as causing droughts or extreme weather in other parts of the world, harm crop yields as well as potential public health and governance issues. It also does not address the issue of rising carbon dioxide emissions, the main greenhouse gas blamed for global warming. Commenting on the study, Phil Williamson at the University of East Anglia said: “Such scenarios are fraught with problems - and international agreement to go ahead with such action would seem near-impossible to achieve.” Reporting by Nina Chestney; Editing by David Goodman",https://uk.reuters.com/article/climate-change-geoengineering/scientists-weigh-up-stratospheric-sunlight-barrier-to-curb-warming-idUKL8N1XX3TH,23 Nov 2018,"Spraying sun-dimming chemicals
