2018-03-17,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s governing Liberal party has won a tight regional election in South Australia, a victory that could deal a blow to  national renewable energy plans.  Saturday’s poll pitted the conservative Liberals against the state’s ruling centre-left Labor party, while independent Nick Xenophon’s new party SA Best failed to win the balance-of-power and have the final say over which major party governs. Incoming Liberal premier Steven Marshall gave his televised victory speech just after 10 p.m. local time.  “It is a tough job, but I tell you what, I’m really looking forward to it .... It’s a new dawn for South Australia.” With 63 percent of votes counted, it was expected the Liberals had won 24 of the 47 lower house seats, giving it a majority to form government in what may have national implications for renewable energy policy. The vote was seen as a choice between solar and wind energy, pushed by Labor, and coal, backed by Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s conservative government. South Australia, the country’s fifth most populous state, has the most wind and solar power but the highest electricity prices in the country. Its 1.7 million citizens suffered repeated blackouts over the last two years when intermittent wind power was insufficient and back-up power from coal and gas was unavailable. Outgoing Labor premier Jay Weatherill had announced a plan in February to create a network of 50,000 home solar systems backed by Tesla Powerwall batteries. Turnbull mocked the state’s renewables policy as a “reckless energy experiment” that created the highest electricity prices in the developed world. The federal government wants to introduce a national energy policy that has no renewable energy target but sets requirements for emissions cuts and reliability. South Australia’s Labor government had refused to go along with it. Energy policy specialist David Blowers at the Grattan Institute think-tank told Reuters last week that if the Liberals were to win in South Australia, the federal government could be expected to get the approval it needs to proceed. The South Australia Liberal party also used a data-mining computer program to intensify lobbying in marginal seats for the first time in this election. The i360 app imported from the United States uses information gleaned from social media, polls and surveys to pinpoint vacillating voters’ addresses and the issues they care about in key marginal seats so they can be targeted for lobbying. If the data-driven widget is credited with the Liberals’ victory, it may become more widely used in future elections. The official result of the final vote tally may not be known for several days.

2018-03-17,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China will set more stringent targets for improving the nation’s air quality under a new three-year plan, as Beijing prepares to beef up a nationwide crackdown on polluters in its years-long campaign to clear its notoriously toxic skies. The new targets for concentrations of small, breathable particles known as PM2.5 will be lower than those in the country’s current five-year plan that was due to end in 2020, environment minister Li Ganjie said at a briefing on the sidelines of the country’s annual Parliament on Saturday. In January, the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) said it was drawing up plans for tougher curbs on smog during the next three years to 2020 after a five-year crackdown on pollution helped it attain air quality targets in December. Li declined to give further details of the new goals as they are still being worked out. By the end of 2017, the country had already cut PM2.5 concentrations by around 15.8 percent, not far from the target of reducing average levels for cities by 18 percent by 2020. “So we will set a lower target for the new three-year plan,” he said. The government will also set up a nationwide inspection system this year, which will give responsibility for regular checks on polluting companies and factories to local authorities, in addition to central government, he said. The government will also punish local authorities who do not enforce the regulations correctly, he said. In some regions last year, regional governments issued blanket orders for companies to close even if they complied with tough emissions rules, he added. The “one size fits all” strategy by some local authorities will not be tolerated, he said. His comments come after the government announced this week the 10-year old MEP will be transformed into a more powerful Ministry of Ecological Environment, absorbing duties overseeing river, marine and soil pollution as well as climate change held by other ministries and departments. It was announced as part of the biggest shake-up of government in years. Li said the bigger ministry would help push environmental protection, which is a hot-button social and economic issue for the world’s No. 2 economy, but he did not give any other details. The chief of the new ministry is expected to be announced next week.
