2018-02-26,"(Paul Shapiro is the author of “Clean Meat: How Growing Meat Without Animals Will Revolutionize Dinner and the World.” The opinions expressed here are his own.) By Paul Shapiro Feb 26 (Reuters) - With six Oscar nominations - including best picture and actor - “Darkest Hour” is fascinating audiences with its portrayal of Winston Churchill facing history-altering decisions at a turning point in World War Two. In fact, Churchill had been thinking about the future of humanity in rather radical ways for years already. In 1931, Churchill published an essay, Fifty Years Hence, in which he made predictions about what the world might look like by the 1980s. Among the more stunning: that humans would figure out how to permanently divorce meat production from animal husbandry. “We shall escape the absurdity of growing a whole chicken in order to eat the breast or wing,” Churchill prophesied, “by growing these parts separately under a suitable medium.” Because doing so would free up land that had been used for growing crops to feed farm animals, he concluded, “parks and gardens will cover our pastures and ploughed fields.” Churchill was a few decades off, but we now have the capacity to do exactly as he foresaw: to grow real meat outside of animals’ bodies. In recent years, so-called “clean meat” - a term first popularized by the nonprofit Good Food Institute as a nod to both “clean energy” and to the meat’s food safety benefits - has moved out of the realm of science fiction and become scientific fact. The first “clean burger” debuted in 2013, thanks in part to research and development funding from Google co-founder Sergey Brin. Since 2014, I’ve had the good fortune to eat clean beef, duck, fish, chorizo, liver, and yogurt, all of it grown without animals. (Perhaps unsurprisingly, clean meat tastes like meat since, well, that’s exactly what it is.) And I’m not the only one interested. These products are starting to get serious attention from traditional meat processors, with agribusiness giants Tyson and Cargill investing in Memphis Meats, a clean meat start-up based in San Leandro. “It’s not a threat to us, it’s an opportunity,” Sonya McCullum Roberts, president of growth ventures at Cargill, recently told Fortune magazine. To be clear, the clean meat that Churchill envisioned, and that companies like Memphis Meats are beginning to produce, isn’t simply an alternative to meat. It’s actual animal muscle tissue, produced without the living, conscious animal. Rather than raising chickens or pigs to slaughter and sell as cuts of meat, clean meat producers take microscopic animal cells, put them in a cultivator so they behave as they do in the body, and feed them so they that grow into muscle tissue just like the meat we eat today. Why would we want to do as Churchill suggested and start producing real meat without animals? Well, for starters, because raising farm animals takes vast resources. To put the problem in perspective, imagine walking through the poultry aisle of your local supermarket. For each whole chicken you see, envision more than one thousand single-gallon jugs of water sitting next to it. Then imagine systematically, one by one, twisting the cap off each jug and pouring them all out. That’s about how much water it takes to bring a single chicken from shell to shelf. In other words, you can save more water by skipping one family chicken dinner than by skipping six months of showers. Growing only the meat we want won’t require all the resources needed to produce entire animals. A 2011 study by Oxford University researcher Hanna Tuomisto estimated that clean beef production could require 99 percent less land and 96 percent less water while producing 96 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions than conventional beef production. Such early studies are admittedly imprecise, since the technologies that will make clean meat commercially viable are still under development. But most analysts believe that even large-scale production of lab-cultured meat is likely to be far more resource-efficient than traditional livestock production. Churchill’s vision of widely-available synthetic meat isn’t yet a reality, but it’s likely a matter of years now, not decades. Meanwhile, plant-based meats are already helping many of us to wean ourselves off the factory farming of animals. Those who worry that Churchill’s vision of meat without animals is “unnatural” may find it helpful to recall just how unsustainable, inhumane, and unnatural contemporary meat production has become. Clean meat probably won’t be competing for market share against meat from pasture-raised animals. Rather, clean meat enthusiasts seek to displace the farm animals providing the vast majority of the meat we eat today: animals that languish in their own feces, never set foot outdoors, and are forced to consume large quantities of antibiotics and other drugs. If we pause to contemplate this harsh reality, the promise of clean meat seems obvious. Churchill had a lot on his plate when he became prime minister. Yet his predictions about the contents of our plates may have even greater relevance today, as we search for ways to reduce the harm we’re doing to the only planet we have. Clean meat may soon prove to be part of the solution.

2018-02-26,"BERLIN, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Germany’s top administrative court will decide on Tuesday whether cities in Europe’s biggest auto market can ban diesel cars, potentially wiping hundreds of million of euros off the value of up to 12 million vehicles. Since Volkswagen was found in 2015 to be cheating on emissions tests in the United States, diesel emissions containing toxic nitrogen oxide (NOx) which is known to cause respiratory disease, have come under close scrutiny. The environmental lobby DUH sued Stuttgart and Duesseldorf to force them to implement driving bans, after about 70 German cities were found to have NOx levels exceeding European Union limits. The German states of Baden-Wuerttemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia have appealed against the decisions, leaving the federal administrative court in Leipzig to rule on whether such bans are legal. The Leipzig tribunal was expected to announce its decision at 1100 GMT on Tuesday. Judge Andreas Korbmacher delayed a verdict last Thursday amid speculation that the European Court of Justice could be consulted over the matter. The regulatory and legal backlash against diesel emissions could cut by almost half the share of diesel cars in overall vehicle production in Europe by 2025, to 27 percent from 52 percent in 2015, Barclays said in a note on Monday. Fiat Chrysler plans to eliminate diesel from its passenger vehicles by 2022 as demand collapses and costs surge, the Financial Times reported on Monday. Germany’s government and the auto industry have been seeking to avert driving bans. Carmakers have pledged to overhaul software on 5.3 million diesel cars and are offering trade-in incentives for older models to help improve air quality. But environmental groups have called software updates insufficient and have lobbied for cars with Euro-6 and Euro-5 emissions standards to get hardware updates of their exhaust treatment systems. Meanwhile, the government has begun work on legal changes to permit driving bans on certain routes on an emergency basis, transport ministry documents seen by Reuters showed . The government is also considering plans to make public transport free in cities suffering from poor air quality. The opposition Green Party approves of that idea; it has called for using the 8 billion euros of annual public diesel subsidies pay for it. If diesel bans are legalized, cities will probably target models with older emissions-control technology. Of the 15 million diesel cars on Germany’s roads, only 2.7 million are equipped with the latest Euro-6 technology, data by the KBA motor vehicle watchdog showed. Retrofits would be costly for carmakers, and an outright diesel ban could slash vehicle resale prices, which are used as a benchmark for pricing leasing and finance contracts. “Driving bans are antisocial and should be avoided,” Matthias Wissmann, the outgoing head of Germany’s VDA auto industry lobby said in an interview with the Stuttgarter Zeitung published on Monday. “There should be solutions that will not burden motorists, are socially acceptable and ensure planning capability.” (Reporting by Andreas Cremer, editing by Larry King)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/germany-emissions/german-court-to-rule-on-city-bans-for-diesel-cars-idUKL8N1QG35K,26 Feb 2018,"Germany's top administrative

2018-02-26,"NEW YORK, Feb 26 (Reuters) - The lieutenant governor of Georgia on Monday threatened to block legislation that includes lucrative tax benefits for Delta Air Lines Inc because the Atlanta-based airline dropped a partnership with the National Rifle Association after a public backlash in the wake of the recent Florida school shooting. “I will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA,” Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle, a Republican, wrote on Twitter. “Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back.” The Feb. 14 massacre of 17 students and educators at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, by a gunman with a legally purchased semiautomatic rifle reignited the nation’s long-running debate over gun rights. Several U.S. companies are cutting ties with the NRA and gun manufacturers in the wake of the shooting. On Saturday, Delta and United Airlines Inc said they were no longer offering NRA members discounted rates and they would ask the NRA to remove their information from its website. Delta said its decision reflected a neutral stance in the heated gun control debate. It said it continues to support the Second Amendment, which grants Americans the right to bear arms. Delta officials could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday. The airline is one of the largest employers in Georgia. Cagle’s tweet follows a wave of threats to boycott the carrier after Delta’s Saturday announcement. Neither Cagle’s office nor the NRA were immediately available for comment. The Georgia legislature is considering a proposed jet fuel tax exemption designed to benefit Delta, but as of Monday, several state Republicans have threatened to withdraw their support for the provision. Emory University School of Law Professor Robert Schapiro said that the state has broad discretion in deciding which entities to tax or not tax. “In terms of legality, the legislature has a broad ability to grant tax exemptions or not grant tax exemptions,” Schapiro said. “So it doesn’t violate any constitutional principle” to pull support over the NRA debate. Cagle is running for governor of the state in the 2018 race.

2018-02-26,"(Adds industry comment) Feb 26 (Reuters) - Canada’s biggest oil-producing province, Alberta, said on Monday it will spend up to C$1 billion ($788.7 million) in grants and loan guarantees to spur construction of partial upgrading facilities for its heavy crude. Partial upgrading reduces the thickness of oil sands bitumen, allowing it to flow through pipelines without having to be diluted, cutting costs and increasing the volume that can move. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said the funds will spread over eight years, starting in the government’s 2019-20 fiscal year. The money may leverage the building of two to five partial upgrading facilities worth some C$5 billion in private investment, she said. The step is part of a larger strategy by the Alberta government to squeeze more value from energy resources. The move is in line with recommendations from Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), one of the largest industry groups, and may spur construction of new facilities, Ben Brunnen, CAPP’s vice-president of oil sands, said. “We could see this move the needle for some companies,” Brunnen said. Alberta’s oil producers are under pressure from tight transportation capacity in the landlocked province that has created big price discounts for the heavy crude compared to benchmark West Texas Intermediate light oil.

2018-02-26,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of U.S. investors is seeking Washington’s approval to acquire the nearly 50 percent collateral in U.S. refiner Citgo held by Russia’s largest state-owned energy firm Rosneft, one of the investors said. The move would prevent Moscow from seizing a large part of the U.S. refiner in the event of a full-blown default by its current owner, Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA. Texas-based Citgo operates a 749,000 barrel per day refining network in the United States. With Venezuela’s economy devastated by five years of recession, President Nicolas Maduro’s socialist government has increasingly turned to ally Russia for the cash and credit it needs to survive – offering prized state-owned oil assets in return. Rosneft has snapped up some coveted oil fields in the OPEC nation, giving it growing control over Venezuelan crude exports and a stronger foothold in energy markets across the Americas.  Venezuela handed Rosneft ROSN.MM the 49.9 percent collateral in Citgo PDVSAC.UL in return for a $1.5 billion loan two years ago. The remaining 50.1 percent of shares in Citgo is collateral to holders of PDVSA’s 2020 bond. A steady decline in oil output, Venezuela’s main source of hard currency, has contributed to making the country chronically late on its bond payments in recent months. The Russian state oil company has been under U.S. sanctions put in place in 2014 to punish Moscow for aggression in Ukraine. Some U.S. senators have warned those sanctions could be violated should Russia take a stake in Citgo. Amid the outcry, Rosneft and PDVSA PDVSA.UL were negotiating swapping the collateral to avoid complications stemming from the sanctions. The talks do not appear to have prospered. Some Caracas-based oil sources said cash-strapped PDVSA was unable to offer anything attractive enough to Rosneft in return.  In the meantime, the group of U.S. investors has applied for a license from the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to assume the lien, according to the U.S. investor and documents seen by Reuters. The investor asked to remain anonymous to avoid compromising a potential deal. The request to OFAC, submitted in early October, has received basic technical approval but the group has yet to receive an answer from the Trump administration. “The administration should recognize that if it doesn’t do something pro-active here, it will face...limited options under almost any scenario, whether it is an attempt to foreclose by the current lienholder, further restrictions on Venezuelan crude oil imports into the U.S., or even in the event there is a positive political change in Caracas,” the investor said. Under the plan, no new debt would be issued. The investors would repay the outstanding loan balance and require that Rosneft terminate its lien and assign the loan to the new investors. “This is a private sector solution to a public policy problem,” the investor added. In response to a query from Reuters, a Treasury spokesman said “Treasury does not discuss OFAC licensing requests, including to confirm whether or not one has been received, and does not comment on national security reviews.” The U.S. investors see Citgo as an attractive asset that could easily become highly profitable. Trying to seize Citgo is “certainly not the plan,” the investor stressed. It is unclear whether Rosneft, whose powerful boss Igor Sechin is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, would be open to such an offer. The company declined to comment. Caracas-based PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment. The Citgo deal has particularly worried Washington, with senators Robert Menendez and Marco Rubio writing U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to express their concern in September. “Just as a matter of common sense, it would be better if those assets were held by American investors than by Rosneft,” said Richard Morningstar, chairman of the Global Energy Center at the Atlantic Council and a former energy official under ex-president Barack Obama. Despite long delays in Venezuela’s debt payments, the holders of the bonds - some of the world’s highest yielding debt - have been reluctant to press their claims in court, wary of a prolonged and messy litigation. That could yet change, sparking a potential stampede to seize assets. Foreign companies seeking compensation for nationalizations under Venezuela’s late leader Hugo Chavez have also objected to PDVSA using Citgo as collateral, alleging that Venezuela was seeking to reduce its exposure to assets in the United States, where they could potentially be seized.

2018-02-26,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equities rose on Monday, with Wall Street surging more than 1 percent, while the dollar was little changed as investors bet the new head of the Federal Reserve will steer a steady course on policy when he addresses U.S. lawmakers this week. U.S. Treasury yields fell as traders reduced bearish bond positions ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s testimony before Congress on Tuesday. It will be his first major address since taking over from Janet Yellen earlier this month. Euro zone government bond yields fell further after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said slack in the region’s economy may be greater than previously estimated and could slow inflation’s rise, though only temporarily. Prices will eventually climb, he said. Technology shares and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway BRKz.N drove gains on Wall Street, with Berkshire up after Buffett said the conglomerate is “more inclined” to use excess cash to buy back shares than pay dividends. Consumer staples and healthcare stocks pushed European bourses higher, led by Novartis (NOVN.S), Unilever (UNc.AS) and Nestle (NESN.S). Since the beginning of February, investor skittishness about the pace of Fed interest rate hikes has weighed on stock markets worldwide. But most traders believe Powell will stay the course and gradually raise interest rates, despite indications inflation is perking up. “There’s some talk of (Powell) being a little more open to tolerating inflation running above the 2 percent target. The focus will be to see if he is indeed open to that and the rationale behind it,” said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management.

The dollar traded near break-even ahead of a slew of U.S. economic data and events this week, including Powell’s testimony, which could determine whether the greenback’s recent recovery from a three-year low can be sustained.  “If Powell suggests that the Federal Reserve could raise U.S. interest rates four times in 2018, it could be seen as a positive sign for the U.S. dollar,” said Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy and market research at online brokerage FXTM.

2018-02-26,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil rose on Monday, hitting three-week highs, supported by strong U.S. demand and comments from Saudi Arabia that it would continue to curb production in line with OPEC-led efforts. Brent crude rose 19 cents to settle at $67.50 a barrel. During the session, it hit a three-week high of $67.90. U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures rose 36 cents to settle at $63.91 a barrel, after hitting a 20-day high of $64.24.  Both benchmarks rose last week - Brent by almost 4 percent and WTI by 3 percent.  “Today and this week are going to be critical to answering the question, is this a market correction or is this a resumption of an uptrend?” said Walter Zimmerman, chief technical analyst at United-ICAP.  Prices were supported by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, who said on Saturday the country’s January-March crude production would be well below output caps, with exports averaging less than 7 million barrels per day. He said Saudi Arabia hoped OPEC and its allies would be able to relax production cuts next year and create a permanent framework to stabilize oil markets after the current agreement on supply cuts ends this year. The possibility of an eventual end to production cuts, however, may be a bearish development longer-term, said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho.  Data released last week by the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed a surprise draw in crude inventories. “Last week’s inventory report wasn’t bullish, but it also wasn’t bearish. And that got the bulls excited,” said Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Futures in Chicago.  “Historically, this is usually a transitory kind of lull, where demand tapers back, we haven’t seen that yet.”  Demand in Europe may also be getting some help. A cold snap across the continent has encouraged some refiners to delay maintenance, which could support demand and help end a bout of profit-taking, analysts said. “Our view is demand will be strong enough, but we don’t see a big breakout,” said Natixis oil analyst Joel Hancock, adding he expected a price in the range of $60 to $70 this year. Still, hedge funds and money managers lifted their bullish wagers on U.S. crude oil for the first time in four weeks, data showed on Friday. Libya’s National Oil Corp said on Saturday it had declared force majeure on the 70,000-bpd El Feel oilfield after a protest by guards closed the field.

2018-02-26,"(Reuters) - U.S. farm groups urged President Donald Trump in a letter on Monday not to weaken the nation’s biofuels policy requiring corn-based ethanol to be blended into gasoline, calling it a critical engine of rural American jobs. Trump is due to meet with senators and cabinet members on Tuesday to discuss potential tweaks to the law, called the Renewable Fuel Standard, that would help oil refiners who have increasingly complained the program costs them a fortune. “As you meet this week to discuss these issues, we ask that you not entertain proposals that would undermine the purpose and intent of the RFS,” according to the letter, signed by the heads of six farm groups, including the National Corn Growers Association and the American Farm Bureau Federation. “Any action that seeks to weaken the RFS for the benefit of a handful of refiners will, by extension, be borne on the backs of our farmers,” according to the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. The RFS requires oil refiners to cover the cost of blending increasing amounts of ethanol and other biofuels into the nation’s fuels each year. The policy was adopted during President George W. Bush’s administration to help farmers, cut petroleum imports and lower pollutant emissions. Under the program, refiners must earn or purchase biofuel blending credits called RINs to prove that they are complying. As biofuels volume quotas have increased over the years, so have prices for the credits – meaning refiners that must buy them are facing rising costs. Oil refiner Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES), which employs more than a thousand people in Philadelphia, declared bankruptcy last month and blamed the regulation for its demise. Reuters reported other factors may also have played a role in the company’s bankruptcy, including the withdrawal of more than $590 million in dividend-style payments from the refinery by its investor owners. Trump is due to discuss potential changes to the RFS on Tuesday with Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of corn state Iowa, along with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, and potentially Energy Secretary Rick Perry, according to sources familiar with the matter. While a handful of proposals will be considered, the sources said, past efforts to change the RFS have been stymied by strong opposition by corn lobbyists.

2018-02-26,"LA PAZ, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Bolivia’s state-run oil company YPFB signed a memorandum of understanding with Dubai-based Kampac Oil and London-based investment office Milner Capital for oil and gas exploration and production, Bolivian President Evo Morales said on Monday. Under the terms of the memorandum, the two companies would invest $2.5 billion in the Madre de Dios basin in northern Bolivia, which has the potential to produce 4 billion barrels of oil and 12 trillion cubic feet of gas. Kampac would invest $500 million and Milner would invest $2 billion. “These agreements signed with Kampac Oil, based in Dubai, and Milner Capita, based in London - new partners that are joining our exploration and production efforts - show that Bolivian norms give legal security to foreign companies,” Morales said in a post on Twitter announcing the deal. The deal includes investment to search for hydrocarbons in exploratory fields and to increase production in mature fields, Jose Morao Patino, partner and head of Latin America at Milner Capital, said at an event marking the deal in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Landlocked Bolivia is South America’s top natural gas exporter, but contract re-negotiations with neighboring Argentina and Brazil as well as declining reserves and production could threaten its economy, which has grown at one of the fastest rates in the region in recent years.

2018-02-26,"Feb 26 (Reuters) - Canada’s biggest oil-producing province, Alberta, said on Monday it will spend up to C$1 billion ($788.7 million) in grants and loan guarantees to spur construction of partial upgrading facilities for its heavy crude. Partial upgrading reduces the thickness of oil sands bitumen, allowing it to flow through pipelines without having to be diluted, cutting costs and increasing the volume that can move. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said the funds will spread over eight years, starting in the government’s 2019-20 fiscal year. The money may leverage the building of two to five partial upgrading facilities worth some C$5 billion in private investment, she said. The step is part of a larger strategy by the Alberta government to squeeze more value from energy resources. Alberta’s oil producers are under pressure from tight transportation capacity in the landlocked province that has created big price discounts for the heavy crude compared to benchmark West Texas Intermediate light oil.

2018-02-26,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Swiss commodities trader AOT Energy on Monday confirmed it is in discussions with potential investors over a stake in the company and that it has this year pared its staff.  On Friday, Reuters reported the firm was mulling a sale of part or all of its business amid shrinking credit lines, and that AOT Energy’s chief financial officer and managing director in Houston were exiting the firm. AOT Energy said in a statement in response on its website on Monday that it was in talks with “several strategic investors to co-invest in the acquisition” of the 51 percent of the company controlled by Belgium’s Frere Group. The talks were aimed at “enhancing” the business of both parties, said Martin Fasser, AOT Energy’s head of corporate affairs. Fasser declined to comment further.   Management, traders and some employees hold the remaining 49 percent stake. The statement also said the firm had parted with its Houston-based senior management team “due to disagreements in organization and management.” AOT Energy in 2016 initiated a management buy-out from its parent, Frere Group. Ahead of the buy-out, the company was restructured and its equity reduced, leading to a smaller credit line, Fasser said on Monday. Its credit lines are “significantly over” $2 billion, he added.

2018-02-26,"(Repeats to additional subscribers with no changes to text) By Alexandra Ulmer WASHINGTON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - A group of U.S. investors is seeking Washington’s approval to acquire the nearly 50 percent collateral in U.S. refiner Citgo held by Russia’s largest state-owned energy firm Rosneft, one of the investors said. The move would prevent Moscow from seizing a large part of the U.S. refiner in the event of a full-blown default by its current owner, Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA. Texas-based Citgo operates a 749,000 barrel per day refining network in the United States. With Venezuela’s economy devastated by five years of recession, President Nicolas Maduro’s socialist government has increasingly turned to ally Russia for the cash and credit it needs to survive – offering prized state-owned oil assets in return. Rosneft has snapped up some coveted oil fields in the OPEC nation, giving it growing control over Venezuelan crude exports and a stronger foothold in energy markets across the Americas. Venezuela handed Rosneft the 49.9 percent collateral in Citgo in return for a $1.5 billion loan two years ago. The remaining 50.1 percent of shares in Citgo is collateral to holders of PDVSA’s 2020 bond. A steady decline in oil output, Venezuela’s main source of hard currency, has contributed to making the country chronically late on its bond payments in recent months. The Russian state oil company has been under U.S. sanctions put in place in 2014 to punish Moscow for aggression in Ukraine. Some U.S. senators have warned those sanctions could be violated should Russia take a stake in Citgo in the event of a full-blown PDVSA default. Amid the outcry, Rosneft and PDVSA were negotiating swapping the collateral to avoid complications stemming from the sanctions but the talks do not appear to have prospered. Some Caracas-based oil sources said cash-strapped PDVSA was unable to offer anything attractive enough to Rosneft in return. In the meantime, the group of U.S. investors has applied for a license from the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to assume the lien, according to the U.S. investor and documents seen by Reuters. The investor asked to remain anonymous to avoid compromising a potential deal. The request to OFAC, submitted in early October, has received basic technical approval but the group has yet to receive an answer from the Trump administration. OFAC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “The administration should recognize that if it doesn’t do something pro-active here, it will face...limited options under almost any scenario, whether it is an attempt to foreclose by the current lienholder, further restrictions on Venezuelan crude oil imports into the U.S., or even in the event there is a positive political change in Caracas,” the investor said. Under the plan, no new debt would be issued. The investors would repay the outstanding loan balance and require that Rosneft terminate its lien and assign the loan to the new investors. “This is a private sector solution to a public policy problem,” the investor added. The U.S. investors see Citgo as an attractive asset that could easily become highly profitable. Trying to seize Citgo is “certainly not the plan,” the investor stressed. It is unclear whether Rosneft, whose powerful boss Igor Sechin is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, would be open to such an offer. The company declined to comment. Caracas-based PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment. The Citgo deal has particularly worried Washington, with senators Robert Menendez and Marco Rubio writing U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to express their concern in September. “Just as a matter of common sense, it would be better if those assets were held by American investors than by Rosneft,” said Richard Morningstar, chairman of the Global Energy Center at the Atlantic Council and a former energy official under ex-president Barack Obama. Despite long delays in Venezuela’s debt payments, the holders of the bonds - some of the world’s highest yielding debt - have been reluctant to press their claims in court, wary of a prolonged and messy litigation. That could yet change, sparking a potential stampede to seize assets. Foreign companies seeking compensation for nationalizations under Venezuela’s late leader Hugo Chavez have also objected to PDVSA using Citgo as collateral, alleging that Venezuela was seeking to reduce its exposure to assets in the United States, where they could potentially be seized.

2018-02-26,"(Recasts headline, lead, adds quote and details on output and refining) By David Alire Garcia MEXICO CITY, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Mexican state-owned oil company Pemex reported a nearly $18 billion fourth-quarter loss on Monday after both crude output and processing slid, though the company said refining levels should rebound as major maintenance plans are completed. The company posted a 352.3 billion ($17.9 bln) peso loss for the last quarter of 2017, blaming a weaker peso exchange rate and higher financing costs for its performance, according to a filing with the Mexican stock exchange. The loss compares to a profit of some 72.6 billion Mexican pesos in the year-ago period. Maintenance at Pemex’s Ciudad Madero and Minatitlan refineries will be completed by the end of March, senior executive Josefa Casas said on a call with analysts. Boosting crude processing at both facilities should help reverse a prolonged decline in refining levels. “Investment resources continue in the maintenance of (Pemex’s) six refineries with the intention of not only stabilizing operations but also positively increasing crude processing margins in the production of refined products,” said Casas. Pemex lost 151 billion pesos during the fourth quarter due to a weaker peso, the company said, which depreciated 8 percent against the U.S. dollar. While most of Pemex’s costs are in pesos, it sells crude oil and buys imported fuels like gasoline in dollars. Financial costs were up 35 percent during the quarter, mainly because of larger indebtedness, the company said. Also weighing on the quarterly result, Pemex’s tax bill more than doubled to reach 98.8 billion pesos. Crude oil production was down about 9 percent during the quarter at 1.881 million barrels per day (bpd). Total 2017 crude output averaged 1.948 million bpd, down nearly 10 percent compared to 2016 production, which the company said was due in large part to the natural decline of its fields. Meanwhile, crude processing at the company’s six refineries dipped to just 574,000 bpd during the quarter despite a processing capacity of about 1.6 million bpd. Pemex’s annual crude processing in 2017 averaged 776,000 bpd compared to 962,000 bpd in 2016. The lower level of refining activity was blamed on the impact of natural disasters, including a major earthquake, on Pemex’s Salina Cruz facility, the company’s biggest. Casas added that Pemex continues to look for partners at its Salina Cruz and Salamanca refineries, both of which need to be reconfigured to better process heavy crude. $1 = 19.6595 pesos on Dec. 29

2018-02-26,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian automotive parts maker Sogefi (SGFI.MI) plans to grow organically and through acquisitions in all three of its business segments, its Chief Executive Laurent Hebenstreit said. Sogefi, which develops and produces filtration systems, suspension components as well as air management and engine cooling systems, hopes to strengthen its position in Europe but also grow further in North America, India and China.  “I’m looking at different opportunities as we speak,” Hebenstreit told Reuters in an interview on Monday.  “With a debt to EBITDA ratio at 1.6, if we find any good opportunities, we have ways to fund them.”  Recent organic expansion included a Mexico suspension plant, which opened last year, and a filtration facility in Morocco that will be launched by July.  Sogefi chose Morocco because of its competitiveness and because of future car manufacturing that might be based in the North African country given the government’s plans to raise vehicle production to a million per year from 370,000 in 2017. Sogefi plans to make a decision on another suspension plant investment in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region later this year, the CEO said, adding the new investment would be greater than the 10 million euros spent in Morocco. Already present in 21 countries with 42 production sites, Sogefi is looking at partnerships with hardware startups and would take stakes of at least 5-10 percent to “help them grow”.  Sogefi’s main clients include mass market player such as U.S. carmaker Ford (F.N), France’s Renault (RENA.PA) and PSA Group (PEUP.PA) and Italian-American Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI).  But it also hopes to increase the share of sales to German premium carmakers such as Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE), to invest in higher-end technology and give it a boost over German rivals Mubea, Mann+Hummel and Mahle, Hebenstreit said.  The shift away from diesel engines does not worry Sogefi, which expects the technology to support sales for years to come.  But the real growth will come from the higher technology requirement in hybrid vehicles and completely new products that a shift to electrification will require, he said. He dismissed the idea Sogefi, with a market capitalisation of 440 million euros, could be a takeover target, adding it was on a growth path and did not need a “white knight”.   Sogefi reported a 8.6 percent increase in full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to 165.8 million euros ($204 million) on Monday, while sales were up 7.3 percent at constant exchange rates to 1.67 billion euros.  For 2018, Hebenstreit expects sales to outperform a projected 1.5 percent growth in the market by 1-2 percent at constant exchange rates, helped by the Mexico and Morocco investments. He also expects Sogefi’s profit to increase, but did not say by how much.  Sogefi has not paid a dividend in five years.  “Given the investments that we have ahead of us, it’s too early,” Hebenstreit said, adding he did not rule out this changing in the future.

2018-02-26,"VIENNA, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Vienna prosecutors are broadening their probe into a $2 billion Eurofighter jet purchase by Austria and are investigating former defence minister Norbert Darabos for breach of trust, a spokeswoman said on Monday. The prosecutors launched investigations against Airbus and the Eurofighter consortium in February 2017 after the defence ministry said it believed they had misled Austria about the price, deliverability and equipment of the 2003 deal. Their investigations involve individuals including Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders. The consortium and Enders have denied the accusations. Darabos, who agreed a settlement with Eurofighter in 2007 to reduce the order, is the first known former cabinet member to formally be targeted by prosecutors. “I can confirm that Mr (Norbert) Darabos is under investigation for alleged breach of trust,” a spokeswoman for the Vienna prosecutors said, confirming earlier reports by Austrian dailies Kurier and Kronen Zeitung but not elaborating any further. Darabos was not immediately available for comment. Now member of the Burgenland regional government, he told Austrian daily Kurier that he had been questioned by prosecutors several months ago. Austria’s 2003 purchase of 18 Eurofighter jets, approved by the then-conservative-far right coalition government, linked to bribery accusations from the outset. A parliamentary inquiry, set up under a Social Democratic-led government in 2006, explicitly sought reasons to cancel the contract. But in 2007, Defence Minister Darabos, also a Social Democrat, agreed a settlement with the Eurofighter consortium to reduce the order to 15 jets from 18 and the volume of side deals to 3.5 billion euros from 4 billion euros. Those so-called offset deals are common in large arms deals and meant to let local businesses benefit. A second parliamentary inquiry examined the settlement last year. While it found no indications of bribery or that Airbus and its partners illegally influenced Austrian politicians, the committee’s final report assessed that Darabos did not liaise sufficiently with other ministries and agencies while negotiating the settlement and was not transparent enough to allow a court audit of the deal.

2018-02-26,"MILAN (Reuters) - An Italian prosecutor has asked for jail sentences for a top manager and a former chief executive of oil and gas group Eni (ENI.MI) who are standing trial in an Algerian corruption case. Milan prosecutor Isidoro Palma asked on Monday for Eni’s Chief Upstream Officer Antonio Vella and former CEO Paolo Scaroni to be given sentences of five years and four months and six years and four months, respectively, in the case which is still ongoing. Under Italy’s legal process, prosecutors can ask for a jail sentence in a case even though no verdict has been delivered. But a judge does not have to act on a prosecutor’s request in terms of sentencing. Both Vella and Scaroni have previously denied any wrongdoing. Lawyers for Vella, who was head of Eni’s North Africa business at the time, and for Scaroni were not immediately available to comment on Monday. The case covers the period 2007 to 2010. An Eni spokesman reiterated the company’s previous denial of any wrongdoing, adding it would be able to present its position in defence hearings in coming weeks. Palma also asked for Eni and oil service group Saipem (SPMI.MI) to be fined 900,000 euros ($1.1 million) each. Jail sentences were also requested for some former Saipem executives. The long-running case revolves around allegations that Saipem paid intermediaries around 197 million euros to bag contracts worth 8 billion euros with Algeria’s state-owned Sonatrach. Prosecutors claim the payment also allowed Eni to get a green light from Algeria’s Energy Ministry to buy Canadian oil and gas company First Calgary Petroleums.

2018-02-26,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has issued a new round of sanctions targeting oil smugglers in Libya aimed at blocking exploitation of natural resources that is driving instability, the U.S. Treasury Department said on Monday. In a statement, Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said it was sanctioning six people, 24 companies and seven vessels in a move that prohibits Americans from engaging with those targeted and freezes any related property under U.S. jurisdictions.  The sanctions target people from Libya, Malta and Egypt, according to the statement. Issued under the authority of a 2016  executive order by then U.S. President Barack Obama, companies based in Italy, Libya and Malta are also targets, the statement said.  The United Nations Security Council has condemned illicit exploitation of oil from Libya, which has been mired in conflict since an uprising in 2011 that overthrew Muammar Gaddafi, who led the country for more than 30 years. “Oil smuggling undermines Libya’s sovereignty, fuels the black market and contributes to further instability in the region while robbing the population of resources that are rightly theirs,” OFAC’s statement said. Libya’s oil production has steadied but is still well below the 1.6 million barrels per day it was pumping before the insurgency seven years ago and is suffering from theft, abduction and other security threats.  Production from at least one Libyan oil field has also been disrupted by a dispute over security guards’ pay.

The motion came after U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick on Friday issued a preliminary injunction revoking a needed permit for the pipeline, which is already under construction. Environmental groups and local fisherman have opposed the line, citing concerns about the environment and local economy. A portion of the pipeline would run through the Atchafalaya Basin, a nearly 1 million acre wetland in southern Louisiana that is a critical component of the state’s commercial fishing industry and flood protection system. Representatives from Energy Transfer Partners did not respond to a request for comment. The project is 60 percent owned by ETP with the remainder controlled by refiner Phillips 66. The disputed pipeline is an extension to an existing line, which transports crude from Nederland, Texas, to Lake Charles, Louisiana. The new segment would extend the system to St. James, Louisiana, and have capacity to transport up to 480,000 barrels per day of oil. Energy Transfer Partners last year prevailed over a fierce push from environmental and Native American groups to halt its controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. Although opponents of that line were able to temporarily stop construction, it began service in mid-2017.

U.S. Treasury yields fell as traders reduced bearish bond positions ahead of new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s testimony before Congress on Tuesday that will be his first major address since taking over from Janet Yellen earlier this month. Euro zone government bond yields also drifted lower as investors awaited a speech by European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi later in the day and a flash estimate of euro zone inflation data for February that is due on Wednesday. Technology shares and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway drove gains on Wall Street while consumer staples and healthcare stocks pushed European bourses higher, led by Novartis, Unilever and Nestle. Most traders believe Powell will stay the course and gradually raise interest rates despite indications inflation is perking up. “There’s some talk of (Powell) being a little more open to tolerating inflation running above the 2 percent target. The focus will be to see if he is indeed open to that and the rationale behind it,” said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management. MSCI’s gauge of equity market performance in 47 countries gained 0.35 percent and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares rose 0.39 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 164.86 points, or 0.65 percent, to 25,474.85. The S&P 500 gained 9.32 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,756.62 and the Nasdaq Composite added 30.19 points, or 0.41 percent, to 7,367.58. Equity markets rose earlier in Asia, with Chinese stocks closing 1.2 percent higher after the ruling Communist Party set the stage for President Xi Jinping to stay in office indefinitely. The dollar rose in choppy trade as the prospect the Fed will raise rates more than the three times it has signaled for 2018 has bolstered the U.S. currency the past few weeks. “If Powell suggests that the Federal Reserve could raise U.S. interest rates four times in 2018, it could be seen as a positive sign for the U.S. dollar,” said Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy and market research at online brokerage FXTM. The dollar index was up 0.04 percent, with the euro up 0.06 percent to $1.23. The Japanese yen firmed 0.01 percent versus the greenback at 106.90 per dollar. Germany’s benchmark Bund yield briefly touched a one-month low and the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield slid after last week it reached a four-year high near 3 percent on concerns about growing inflation and growing U.S. government deficit. The 10-year Bund yield touched a one-month low at 0.639 percent before steadying at around 0.65 percent. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note last rose 9/32 in price to push yields down to 2.8405 percent. Oil prices rebounded, supported by comments from Saudi Arabia that it would continue to curb shipments in line with the effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut global supplies.

A spokesman at Papua New Guinea’s National Disaster Centre said by telephone the affected area was very remote and the agency could not properly assess damage until communication was re-established.  He said there were no confirmed casualties, although the International Red Cross (IRC) in Papua New Guinea said some reports indicated there were “fears of human casualties”. “It’s very serious all across the Southern Highlands and also all over the western highlands. People are definitely very frightened,” Udaya Regmi, the head of the IRC in Papua New Guinea, said by telephone from Port Moresby. The PNG government also said it had sent disaster assessment teams. At least 13 aftershocks with a magnitude of 5.0 or more rattled the area throughout the day, according to USGS data, but no tsunami warnings were issued. Early on Tuesday, USGS reported that another quake with a magnitude of 6.4 had hit 142 km (88 miles) from the city of Mount Hagen at a depth of about 10 km. (For a graphic on Papua New Guinea's 7.5 magnitude earthquake, click tmsnrt.rs/2ow1YLR) “The Papua New Guinea Defense Force has also been mobilized to assist with the assessment and the delivery of assistance to affected people as well as the restoration of services and infrastructure,” Isaac Lupari, the chief secretary to the government, said in a statement after Monday’s tremor. ExxonMobil said it had shut its Hides gas conditioning plant and that it believed administration buildings, living quarters and a mess hall had been damaged. It also said it had suspended flights into the nearby Komo airfield until the runway could be  surveyed. “Due to the damage to the Hides camp quarters and continuing aftershocks, ExxonMobil PNG is putting plans in place to evacuate non-essential staff,” the company said in an emailed statement. Gas is processed at Hides and transported along a 700 km (435 miles) line that feeds a liquefied natural gas plant near Port Moresby for shipping. PNG oil and gas explorer Oil Search (OSH.AX) said in a statement it had also shut production in the quake-affected area. The giant Grasberg copper mine operated by the Indonesian unit of Freeport McMoRan (FCX.N) in neighboring Papua province was not affected, a Jakarta-based spokesman said. However, the quake and several aftershocks caused panic in Jayapura, the capital of Indonesian Papua, Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency said in a statement, but there were no reports of casualties or damage there. The IRC’s Regmi said communications were “completely down” in Tari, one of the larger settlements near the quake’s epicenter, and that landslides had cut roads. Several other aid and missionary agencies said poor communications in the area made damage and injury assessment difficult. “The bush structures that they build tend to handle earthquakes extremely well,” Christian missionary Brandon Buser told Reuters after contacting several remote villages by shortwave radio. Earthquakes are common in Papua New Guinea, which sits on the Pacific’s “Ring of Fire”, a hotspot for seismic activity due to friction between tectonic plates.  “This is the Papuan fold-and-thrust belt, so it’s a typical movement of faults in that region, but it’s big,” said Chris McKee, acting director of the Geohazards Management Division in Port Moresby. Part of PNG’s northern coast was devastated in 1998 by a tsunami, generated by a 7.0 quake, which killed about 2,200 people.

2018-02-26,"* Shell sees LNG demand growing by 4 pct a year until 2035 * Gas demand set to grow by 2 percent per year * Drop in investments is widening supply-demand gap By Ron Bousso LONDON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - More than $200 billion of investment in liquefied natural gas is needed to meet a boom in demand by 2030, Royal Dutch Shell, the world’s top LNG trader, said on Monday. The LNG market is set to continue its rapid expansion into 2020 as facilities approved for construction in the first half of the decade come on line, in a development expected easily to meet sharp growth in consumption of the super-chilled fuel. But a decline in spending in the sector since 2014 as a result of weaker energy prices will create a supply gap from the mid-2020s unless new investments emerge, Shell said in its 2018 LNG Outlook. LNG plants are complex and expensive, requiring large processing units, known as trains, that cool natural gas to around minus 160 degrees Celsius (minus 260 Fahrenheit). The liquefied fuel is then shipped to demand centres and converted back into gas. While LNG demand is expected to grow from 293 million tonnes per year (mtpa) in 2017 to around 500 mtpa by 2030, supplies are seen slipping to 300 mtpa due to a lack of new projects and natural declines in existing production, Shell’s head of integrated gas and new energies, Maarten Wetselaar, said. The cost of developing the required capacity is roughly $1 billion per mtpa, Wetselaar said. That does not include investments in the development of the gas fields associated with LNG plants, he told reporters. “The industry is still looking at quite a challenge to build supplies to meet demand in the 2020s,” he said. Shell is considering moving ahead on new projects such as LNG Canada and Lake Charles on the U.S. Gulf Coast, Wetselaar said. The Anglo-Dutch company is expected this year to launch the Prelude floating LNG plant in Western Australia, one of the largest and most complex gas projects in history. “Our investment cycle is coming to an end with Prelude coming on stream this year. We will have the space to take investment decisions, (but) it doesn’t necessarily mean we will spend the money.” Competition is fierce as projects have to face off against the lowest-cost gas hubs such as North America, where the shale boom has led to abundant and cheap supplies, as well as Qatar, Russia and East Africa. “In order to take a final investment decision on a project of this size you want to make sure it is as low-cost as it can be because the cost of an LNG project ... is going to stick with you for 30, 40 years,” Wetselaar said. In its annual report - a legacy from BG Group, which the company acquired in 2016 - Shell forecast global demand for gas to grow by an average 2 percent per year until 2035. That would make gas the fastest-growing source of energy over the period. LNG demand is set to grow twice as fast as gas power plants in China, South Korea and India switch from coal and governments move to reduce carbon emissions, Shell said.

2018-02-26,"KATHMANDU, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Nepal’s prime minister on Monday named former central banker Yubaraj Khatiwada as the Himalayan nation’s finance minister, to revive a quake-hit economy emerging from a long civil conflict. K.P. Sharma Oli, who was appointed for a second term last week, campaigned on a promise to fight corruption and boost growth. Analysts say the nearly two-thirds victory his coalition with Maoist former rebels won in the 275-member parliament gives him the mandate to usher in change. Khatiwada, who had served as governor of the central bank, Nepal Rastra Bank, is a monetary policy expert and an alumnus of the Delhi School of Economics in neighbouring India. New ministers in Oli’s core team were also sworn in on Monday, a presidential spokesman said. Oli named Ram Bahadur Thapa, a former guerrilla commander of the Maoist party, as the interior minister in charge of law and order, and national administration. An alliance between Oli and former rebel chief Prachanda swept to victory in elections late last year. The Maoists ended their decade-long civil war under a 2006 peace deal. “His nationalism card was a useful tool for elections, but now he has to deliver on his campaign promise of stability and prosperity,” said Kunda Dixit, editor of the Nepali Times weekly. Nepal has seen 11 changes of government in as many years. Instability has fed corruption, slowed growth and hit recovery from a 2015 earthquake that killed 9,000 people. Western diplomats say the stunning election win by the left “emboldened” Nepal’s other giant neighbour, China, which is using its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to strengthen ties. Oli, 66, took a tough position with New Delhi during a border blockade in 2015 and 2016, reaching out to China for the use of its roads and ports, potentially ending his landlocked nation’s sole dependence on India for transit. He has vowed to revoke a decision by the previous government to scrap a deal with China Gezhouba Group Corp to build the $2.5-billion Budhi Gandaki power plant near Kathmandu. Both Asian giants compete to influence Nepal, home to Mount Everest, the world’s highest mountain, and have injected huge amounts of money in aid and investment. Oli has vowed to boost Nepalis’ income to $5,000 per head within a decade, up from $740 now, a goal that would require the economy to grow 12 percent to 13 percent, versus 4.2 percent now, analysts say.

2018-02-26,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) stuck to its commitment to improving petrol engines on Monday with new powertrain units, while flagging technologies which could find their way into electric vehicles (EVs) and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). The Japanese automaker plans to keep refining its petrol engines and the hybrid technology it pioneered two decades ago while also developing battery operated cars as tightening global emissions rules drive a race for longer-range affordable EVs. As high battery prices and range limitations restrain EV take-up, hybrids and plug-in hybrids would be dominant in coming years, Mitsumasa Yamagata, chief engineer at Toyota’s power train product planning division, said. Cars using petrol engines in some form would still account for around 90 percent of all vehicles by 2030, he added.  “Developing the most fuel-efficient powertrains using petrol engines and hybrid systems will be the best way to have an impact (on reducing emissions), and we remain committed to this,” he said at a briefing on Toyota’s new 2.0 litre petrol engine and hybrid systems, which can improve fuel economy by 18 percent and 9 percent, respectively, over its current systems.  “At the same time, we will be able to use the technology developed for these powertrains in EVs and FCVs.”     Already lagging Nissan Motor Co (7201.T), General Motors (GM.N) and BMW (BMWG.DE) in bringing a mass-production EV to market, Toyota has ramped up its EV development in the last year or so, pledging to add more than 10 EV models to its product line-up in the early 2020s after long touting a green-car strategy focusing mainly on hybrids and FCVs.  Last week it announced it had developed ultra-powerful magnets containing fewer rare earth metals which can be used in EVs, while it has also partnered up with Panasonic Corp (6752.T) to develop EV batteries. Yamagata said that components for petrol vehicles could also be used in EVs, including a new “launch” gear used in Toyota’s continuously variable transmission unveiled on Monday which works with a smaller belt drive to enable smoother, more efficient initial acceleration and final deceleration. Industry experts anticipate that take-up of EVs will pick up faster than Toyota expects as decreasing battery costs result in a cost parity between EVs and gasoline-engine cars around 2025, but some say that it could leverage its lead in hybrid technology to help stay competitive during this transition. “Toyota has been developing its hybrid technology since the 1990s and has been improving it all along. This is complex technology which would take a lot of effort (for others) to develop originally,” CLSA analyst Chris Richter said.

2018-02-26,"* Equity markets calm ahead of Fed chief’s testimony * Sterling gains on hawkish BoE deputy governor, Corbyn * Chinese stocks rally as Xi set to stay in power * Graphic: World FX rates in 2017 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * For a live blog on European stocks, type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window By Alasdair Pal LONDON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Global stocks notched further gains on Monday and the dollar stayed on the back foot, as investors bet the new head of the U.S. Federal Reserve will steer a steady course on policy when he addresses lawmakers this week. MSCI’s index of world stocks was up 0.3 percent, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 up 0.6 percent. Asian markets also rose, with Chinese stocks up 1.2 percent after the ruling Communist Party set the stage for President Xi Jinping to stay in office indefinitely. Much of the market’s focus during the coming week will be on monetary policy, with the heads of the European Central Bank and Bank of England set to give speeches. But they are likely to be overshadowed by Fed chair Jerome Powell. U.S. stock markets calmed on Friday after the Fed said it saw steady economic growth continuing and no serious risks on the horizon, a trend that looks set to continue on Monday. Dow Jones futures pointed to the index opening 0.6 percent higher, with S&P 500 futures up 0.4 percent. Investors also seem to be wagering that Powell will stick to that script at his first appearance before the House on Tuesday, followed by testimony to the Senate on Thursday. “Given he’s speaking on behalf of the committee it would be a big surprise to see much deviation from recent Fed commentary, but much will probably be made of how he handles the scrutiny,” said Jim Reid, a macro strategist at Deutsche Bank. The expected lack of policy surprises from Powell saw yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries back off to 2.86 percent and away from a four-year top of 2.957 percent, dragging down the dollar. The currency surrendered early gains to dip 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies to 89.68. That followed a 0.8 percent bounce last week. Sterling was up 0.5 percent on Monday after Bank of England deputy governor Dave Ramsden said the bank might need to raise interest rates somewhat sooner than he had expected if wage growth picked up early this year. The pound also benefited from hopes that Britain’s exit from the European Union might be less disruptive than feared, after opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn gave a speech on Monday backing a new customs union with the bloc. The euro was 0.3 percent firmer on the back of dollar weakness, though investors largely held back from taking big positions ahead of a national election in Italy and the conclusion of coalition talks in Germany. ECB President Mario Draghi is also set to appear before the European Parliament later in the day, while BoE governor Mark Carney speaks in Edinburgh on Friday. In commodities, oil prices steadied after hitting their highest level in nearly three weeks, supported by comments from top exporter Saudi Arabia that it would continue to curb shipments in line with the OPEC-led effort to cut global supplies.

2018-02-26,"FRANKFURT/PARIS (Reuters) - State Grid Corporation of China’s (SGCC) [STGRD.UL] deep pockets will likely overcome any German political resistance to a bid for 20 percent of power network firm 50Hertz, industry sources said, the latest sign of Chinese interest in the German market. SGCC, the world’s largest utility, is in talks with Australian infrastructure fund IFM Investors about buying half its 40 percent stake in 50Hertz, one of Germany’s four high-voltage power network operators. Belgian grid operator Elia (ELI.BR), which owns 60 percent of 50Hertz, said on Friday it had two months to decide whether to exercise a right to buy the 20 percent stake from IFM before SGCC can bid. But investment banking sources said it was unlikely Elia would match SGCC’s price, as it already has operational control. SGCC is expected to bid 800 million to 1 billion euros ($990 million to $1.23 billion) for the 20 percent stake, two people familiar with the matter said. That dwarfs the 810 million Sweden’s Vattenfall [VATN.UL] received when it sold 50Hertz in 2010. “Given the price, there will not be a counterbid from a third party,” one of the sources said. “Once Elia takes its decision the stake sale will finally go ahead.” A second banker said SGCC’s price would be so “outrageously attractive” that IFM would have no choice but to negotiate a sale. IFM is of the world’s largest infrastructure investors and holds stakes in grids, pipelines, airports, harbors, toll roads and energy and water infrastructure in Australia, Europe and the North America. SGCC and IFM did not respond to requests for comment. SGCC’s push underscores China’s unabated interest in German companies. Carmaker Geely [GEELY.UL] said on Monday it had built up a 9.7 percent stake in Daimler (DAIGn.DE). SGCC has quietly amassed a networks portfolio in southern Europe, buying stakes in Portuguese, Italian and Greek grid operators. tinyurl.com/yb82okqs But despite discreet overtures, it has yet to get a foot in the door in northern Europe, as opportunities are rare and Chinese infrastructure investment faces political hurdles. In the German energy industry, China Three Gorges [CYTGP.UL] bought an offshore wind park and Beijing Enterprise (0392.HK) acquired energy-from-waste firm EEW. But neither of those 2016 deals were deemed strategic enough to raise political concerns. Acquisitions by Chinese firms of German technologies and infrastructure have rankled in Germany as China protects its own firms from foreign bids. “There must be no sell-off of critical infrastructure,” Bernd Westphal, Germany’s Social Democrats spokesman on economics and energy told business daily Handelsblatt this month when asked about SGCC’s interest in 50Hertz. Under Germany’s foreign trade legislation, the state can examine cross-border deals if there are concerns about public safety or security, but only if the acquisition involves a stake in the target entity of at least 25 percent.     “The government has no influence on the process, but as usual is willing to enter talks if so desired,” an Economy Ministry spokeswoman said in an e-mailed comment.     In the unlikely case Elia does buy out IFM, SGCC could turn its sights on 50Hertz peer Amprion, one of the sources said. Amprion is 25.1 percent owned by German utility (RWEG.DE), while an investor group around Munich Re (MUVGn.DE), Swiss Life (SLHN.S) and Talanx (TLXGn.DE) holds the rest. “The Chinese want to buy everything that is for sale,” the CEO of French grid giant RTE, Francois Brottes, said this month.

2018-02-26,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Feb 26 - It seems coal miners are adopting one of two disparate strategies, either exit the business in a highly visible way to buff up your climate credentials, or sit tight, keep as quiet as possible and rake in the cash. An example of the public exit from the business is South32 , the Perth-based miner spun out of BHP Billiton which is in the process of selling out of its thermal coal assets in South Africa. Mike Fraser, South32’s president and chief operating office for South Africa, told Reuters earlier this month that the company was aiming to sell its coal assets because it “did not believe in the commodity.” It would also be better if the coal mines were majority-owned by black investors, Fraser said. This is a reasonable recognition that it’s increasingly hard for companies without black investors to do business in South Africa, given its laws and rules aimed at promoting the economic interests of the majority population following centuries of discrimination under first colonial and then white-minority rule. South32 joins Anglo American in getting out of South African coal, with the London-listed miner selling the last of its domestic coal assets to a majority black-owned company in January. Anglo American will continue to export coal from South Africa, but it will no longer be a participant in supplying the domestic market, which is dominated by the state power utility Eskom. Perhaps it’s not surprising that the two major coal asset sales this year are taking place in South Africa, given the ongoing dispute between the government and the mining industry over a new mining charter and the requirements to increase the participation of black investors. But Rio Tinto also decided to exit its Australian coal business, selling out to Yancoal Australia and Glencore. If there is a trend at play here, it’s that diversified miners are the ones most likely to exit coal, and some have cited the risks of being in an increasingly unpopular business. Activists and other investors are ramping up pressure on fund managers and sovereign wealth funds to divest from companies that are in coal. Given coal was a tiny part of Rio’s business, exiting the industry makes sense, especially if you can then tout yourself as a miner of metals that will be part of the electric vehicle and battery revolution. The other choice is to stay in coal and try to mitigate any public backlash. BHP and its alliance partner Mitsubishi are the world’s largest exporters of coking coal, used to make steel, and there are no signs that the miner intends to exit the business. Same goes for Glencore, and both these companies are probably calculating that the monetary rewards from coal still outweigh any public backlash. Benjamin Sporton, chief executive of industry group the World Coal Association, told Reuters in an interview on Monday that there was a positive mood among many coal miners. While Sporton said coal producers acknowledge that the market is shrinking in Europe and faces a huge challenge from cheap natural gas in the United States, Asia is presenting good opportunities. “Our membership see a strong future in Asia,” he said, citing expectations that China and India will remain major importers of both thermal and coking coal, while demand will also be boosted by newer consumers in Asia, such as Vietnam and Pakistan. The absence of major new coal mines and Indonesia reducing exports to fuel domestic demand also means that supply to seaborne markets is likely to be constrained in coming years, even if there is a slowdown in the construction of new coal-fired generators. The reality for many existing coal miners is that conditions now are as good as they have been in living memory. The price of thermal coal is strong, with the Asian thermal benchmark Newcastle Weekly Index ending on Feb. 23 at $110.60 a tonne, the highest in six years. Costs are also down, with the industry having cut every sliver of fat during the five years of declining prices from 2011 to 2015. An example of the strong conditions for coal miners is Australia’s Whitehaven Coal, which on Feb. 16 reported that its first-half underlying profit rose by about 63 percent to A$257.2 million ($204 million). It also paid a dividend for the first time since 2012. For coal miners who can take the heat of the public opinion kitchen these are good times. For those who no longer see coal as part of the future, they can sell out, at prices higher than what they might have expected a few years, and at the same time hopefully gain some climate-change credibility.

2018-02-26,"DILI (Reuters) - East Timor and Australia have reached an agreement for a treaty on their disputed maritime border and on a “pathway” to develop the giant Greater Sunrise offshore gas fields, the Permanent Court of Arbitration said on Monday.  Under the agreement, the share of revenue from the offshore gas field will differ depending on downstream benefits that arise from “different development concepts”, the statement said following talks in Kuala Lumpur. The agreement would establish a maritime boundary in the Timor Sea for the first time. Australia had sought a boundary aligned with its continental shelf, but East Timor argued the border should lie half way between it and Australia - placing much of the Greater Sunrise fields under its control. The long-running dispute had led the owners of Greater Sunrise - Woodside Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell and Japan’s Osaka Gas - to shelve the project. The fields are estimated to hold 5.1 trillion cubic feet of gas and 226 million barrels of condensates, which analysts have  previously estimated could be worth $40 billion (£28.4 billion). However, development could be at least a decade away, with Woodside looking at the latter half of the next decade. Ending years of opposition, Australia agreed in 2017 to accept Dili’s formal notice to terminate an agreement to split petroleum revenue equally from Greater Sunrise and set a 50-year timetable for negotiating a permanent sea boundary. Dili had taken the long-running maritime border dispute to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, an intergovernmental organisation based at The Hague, which ordered compulsory arbitration between the two parties. The court announced last year that the countries had reached an agreement “on the central elements of a maritime boundary delimitation between them in the Timor Sea” – but that details would remain confidential until the deal was finalised. The two governments will meet in New York at the United Nations headquarters on March 6 to sign the new maritime boundary treaty, the statement said. East Timor had been pushing for the building of an onshore processing plant to boost its economy rather than a floating plant.  According to media reports, East Timor could receive up to 80 percent of revenue, but could agree to less if gas is piped to a terminal in the tiny country. The Sunrise joint venture, led by Woodside, said it was aware that the two governments have agreed a new maritime boundaries treaty. “We hope that the Commission’s conclusions and the signing of the treaty will help to provide the fiscal and regulatory certainty required to develop Greater Sunrise for the benefit of all parties,” a Sunrise joint venture spokeswoman said in emailed comments. Australia’s foreign ministry said the countries had “agreed a draft treaty establishing our maritime boundaries and the sharing of revenue from the development of the Greater Sunrise resource”. In the emailed statement, the ministry said the countries would “continue to work towards a decision on the development concept for Greater Sunrise”. East Timor’s oil minister, Hernani Filomena Coelho da Silva, said that his country’s preference was for the gas to come to his country to help development.   “Timor’s preference is that the pipeline will be brought to Timor,” he told Reuters by telephone.

2018-02-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - A plan to truck oil from Iraq’s northern Kirkuk fields to Iran cannot be fully implemented at this stage due to security concerns, the head of the Iran-Iraq chamber of commerce said on Monday. Iraq and Iran have agreed to swap up to 60,000 barrels per day of crude produced from Kirkuk for Iranian oil to be delivered to southern Iraq.  About 30,000 barrels per day of crude is to be trucked to Iran’s Kermanshah refinery in the first instance. “Iran is facing some problems to implement the agreement due to security issues,” said Hamid Hosseini, the Iranian secretary-general of the Iran-Iraq Chamber of Commerce. “Iran does not have X-ray machines to scan the trucks coming from Iraq,” Hosseini was quoted as saying by ISNA news agency. He said Iran was in talks with Iraq to use their X-ray facilities. Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said last month that exporting oil from the Kirkuk fields to Iran would start before the end of January.

2018-02-26,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union threatened Cambodia with economic sanctions on Monday after the country’s ruling party said it had won every seat in a Senate election in which many opposition supporters were stripped of their right to vote. EU foreign ministers said in a statement they were considering “specific targeted measures” against Cambodia, which diplomats said was a warning to long-time Prime Minister Hun Sen that senior government officials could face sanctions. The bloc said it was also reviewing the preferential trade treatment it gives Cambodia because of what rights groups and opposition politicians say is a crackdown by the premier, in power for 30 years, ahead of a national election in July. “The Council urges Cambodia to restore democracy,” EU foreign ministers said, referring to the name of their formal grouping in Brussels. “In view of recent developments, the Council may consider specific targeted measures if the situation does not improve,” the statement said.       It said the EU would step up its monitoring of its  “everything but arms” trade arrangement with Cambodia that allows the Southeast Asian country to export goods, including clothing and textiles, free of tariffs into the bloc, a market of some 500 million people.  Cambodia’s main opposition National Rescue Party was dissolved by a court last November at the government’s request, and the CNRP says authorities subsequently stripped 5,062 of its commune councillors and lawmakers of their voting rights. The dissolution was followed by the arrest of CNRP leader Kem Sokha for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government with U.S. help, an accusation both the United States and Kem Sokha have rejected. Preliminary results published by the ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) at the weekend showed it had won 58 seats on the 62-seat Senate, leaving the other three political parties with nothing.

2018-02-26,"* Higher demand for air travel in 2018 vs 2017 - IATA * Jet fuel production growth lags that of demand - Energy Aspects * Singapore’s jet fuel cash premium on Feb. 23 at highest since 2008 By Seng Li Peng SINGAPORE, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Asian jet fuel differentials, which have surged to their highest since 2008, are likely to stay supported for most of the rest of the year as demand growth outpaces supply increases especially as more passengers take to the skies in the region. Recent cold snaps in Japan and South Korea have spiked demand for kerosene for heating in North Asia this winter, pulling supply away from the pool of fuel available for jet fuel. Kerosene and jet fuel are similar types of middle distillate fuels and demand for one influences the market for the other. Asian refiners are also set to enter their peak maintenance period which will also limit the amount of jet fuel available to the market. Singapore jet fuel differentials, the premiums or discounts to benchmark prices, shot to a premium of $2 a barrel on Feb. 23 on expectations for further market tightness, the highest since May 20, 2008. JET-SIN-DIF Expectations of higher demand growth than supply growth is driving the gains in the differentials. Jet fuel demand in 2018 will increase by an average of 117,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 versus a supply increase of only 102,000 bpd, according to Reuters calculations based on supply and demand balance data from consultants Energy Aspects published in their February middle distillates outlook report. Jet fuel margins for the first two months of 2018 have averaged $15.35 a barrel, up from $12 in 2017 and $11 in 2016 during the same period, according to data on Thomson Reuters Eikon. Even though the North Asian winter will end, air travel demand and the Asian refinery maintenance will support the market. “Over 4.3 billion passengers are expected to travel by air (globally) in 2018, an increase of about 5.6 percent compared to 2017,” said Albert Tjoeng, assistant director, corporate communications, Asia Pacific for International Air Transport Association (IATA). “The industry fuel consumption is expected to grow to 92 billion gallons (2.2 billion barrels) in 2018 (compared to 88 billion gallons in 2017),” Tjoeng said.

MSCI’s index of world stocks was up 0.4 percent, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 up 0.7 percent. Asian markets also rose, with Chinese stocks up 1.2 percent after the ruling Communist Party set the stage for President Xi Jinping to stay in office indefinitely. Much of the market’s focus during the coming week will be on monetary policy, with the heads of the European Central Bank and Bank of England set to give speeches. But they are likely to be overshadowed by Fed chair Jerome Powell. U.S. stock markets calmed on Friday after the Fed said it saw steady economic growth continuing and no serious risks on the horizon. Investors also seem to be wagering that Powell will stick to that script at his first appearance before the House on Tuesday, followed by testimony to the Senate on Thursday. “Given he’s speaking on behalf of the committee it would be a big surprise to see much deviation from recent Fed commentary, but much will probably be made of how he handles the scrutiny,” said Jim Reid, a macro strategist at Deutsche Bank. The expected lack of policy surprises from Powell saw yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries back off to 2.86 percent and away from a four-year top of 2.957 percent, dragging down the dollar. The currency surrendered early gains to dip 0.3 percent against a basket of currencies to 89.66. That followed a 0.8 percent bounce last week. Sterling was up 0.5 percent on Monday after Bank of England deputy governor Dave Ramsden said the bank might need to raise interest rates somewhat sooner than he had expected if wage growth picked up early this year. The pound also benefited from hopes that Britain’s exit from the European Union might be less disruptive than feared, with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn set to give a speech on Monday backing a new customs union with the bloc. The euro was 0.3 percent firmer on the back of dollar weakness, though investors largely held back from taking big positions ahead of a national election in Italy and the conclusion of coalition talks in Germany. ECB President Mario Draghi is also set to appear before the European Parliament later in the day, while BoE governor Mark Carney speaks in Edinburgh on Friday. In commodities, oil prices steadied after hitting their highest level in nearly three weeks, supported by comments from top exporter Saudi Arabia that it would continue to curb shipments in line with the OPEC-led effort to cut global supplies.

2018-02-26,"(Add details, background) By Mai Nguyen HANOI, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Vietnam’s second oil refinery, Nghi Son Refinery and Petrochemical, will be ready for start-up from Feb. 28, its parent firm Vietnam Oil and Gas Group, or PetroVietnam ,said on Monday. The $9 billion plant, co-owned by Kuwait Petroleum Europe BV and Japanese firms Idemitsu Kosan and Mitsui Chemicals , is designed to help Vietnam cope with a shortage of refined oil products. Vietnam’s first refinery Dung Quat currently supplies 30 percent of the country’s total domestic fuel demand. The 200,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Nghi Son plant along with Dung Quat will help Vietnam meet 80 percent of its fuel demand. Operations at Nghi Son, in Thanh Hoa province south of the capital of Hanoi, were previously delay but are now expected to begin producing commercial products such as paraxylene starting in April and, starting in May, A95 gasoline and diesel fuel, PetroVietnam said. Nghi Son will process Kuwaiti crude oil to produce liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, diesel, kerosene and jet fuel, mainly for the domestic market. Kuwait Petroleum International and Idemitsu Kosan each own 35.1 percent, while PetroVietnam holds a 25.1 percent stake and Mitsui Chemicals has 4.7 percent. Vietnam exports some crude oil but its shipments have been decreasing as production declines from older fields and as some production has become uneconomic amid lower oil prices. Late last week, Thailand’s Siam Cement and PetroVietnam started construction of a $5.4 billion petrochemical site at Long Son, near the city of Vung Tau, east of Ho Chi Minh City. The site is scheduled to start operations in 2022. Reporting by Mai Nguyen; Editing by Manolo Serapio Jr. and

2018-02-26,"* Imports from Spain, Germany to boost French power supply * Tuesday peak of 93 gigawatt way below 2012 high of 102 GW (Adds detail on power consumption, import) PARIS, Feb 26 (Reuters) - The unusually cold weather of the coming days will not jeopardise the security of French electricity supply, the country’s power grid operator RTE said on Monday. RTE expects peak consumption of about 93,000 megawatthour (MW) on Tuesday evening around 1900 Central European Time (CET), well below the historical peak of 102,098 MW on Feb. 8, 2012. “Despite temperatures of nine to ten degrees celsius below average in the three coming days, RTE is not worried about security of power supply in France,” an RTE spokesman said. For Monday evening, peak consumption is estimated around 89,500 MW. On Wednesday, consumption of 91,600 MW is expected around 0930 CET with a second peak of 90,500 MW around 1900 CET. RTE said France currently has power generation capacity of about 90,000 MW available, with a further 2,000 MW available from demand reduction and import capacity of nearly 9,000 MW. Imports will come mainly from Spain, where it will be much less cold, and from Germany, where power production will be boosted by strong winds. “Demand reduction and imports provide sufficient margin and there will be no need to use exceptional measures,” RTE said. If demand far exceeds generating and import capacity, RTE can ask some 22 industrial companies with high power consumption to temporarily cut or reduce consumption. It can also lower the tension on the network or proceed to rolling temporary outages in certain areas. EDF said in a statement it had decided to delay planned maintenance outages of its Gravelines 6 and Tricastin 4 reactors by a week. They had been set to go offline on Feb. 24 for refueling and maintenance. Baseload power for delivery on Tuesday in France cost 45 percent more than Monday delivery at 107 euros ($131.91) a megawatt hour. With about a third of all homes relying on electricity for heating, French power demand is highly sensitive to the change in temperatures, with a fall of one degree corresponding to about 2,400 MW of extra power demand, the equivalent of two large nuclear reactors.

2018-02-26,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s top steelmaking city of Tangshan has proposed new restrictions on production once the current curbs expire in March in order to improve air quality, according to a draft document reviewed by Reuters. Tangshan is the world’s biggest steelmaking city, producing more than the whole United States in a single year. Efforts to clean up the city’s air by shuttering capacity should be supportive for steel prices and limit the country’s supply of the alloy for the rest of the year. Under the proposal from the government dated Feb. 12, the city’s mills will continue limiting production for 244 days between March 16 and Nov. 14. The extended blast furnace restrictions will cover 9.875 million tonnes of steel production capacity, according to the draft, which is still in the consultation stage and could be revised.  Mills in the main part of the city, including the Tangsteel Company, a unit of the Hebei Iron and Steel (HBIS) Group, as well as the privately-owned Tangshan Guofeng Iron & Steel Co Ltd, will be ordered to cut production by as much as 15 percent. Other Tangshan mills will cut production by 10 percent, but that could be increased if air quality worsens. Mills that have not obtained licenses to discharge pollutants will have to halt production. Two sources familiar with the matter verified the proposal document. An official with Tangshan Development and Reform Commission, the city’s top economic planner, declined to comment.  The extension of the output curbs, though expected by the market, lifted Chinese steel futures by nearly 4 percent on Monday to their highest in almost three months. Reuters reported on Feb. 1 that Tangshan was considering prolonging the curbs beyond March 15. The city said on Feb. 9 that it would draw up a plan to continue some curbs.  China ordered 28 northern cities to cut steel output by up to half during the winter heating season from Nov. 15 to March 15 as part of an anti-pollution campaign. Tangshan in China’s Hebei province was ranked by the Ministry of Environmental Protection as one of the country’s 10 smoggiest cities last year.  Hebei produced 191 million tonnes of crude steel last year, nearly 20 percent of China’s total. Tangshan accounted for over half of that.

2018-02-26,"MELBOURNE, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Australian miner New Century Resources has agreed to supply zinc concentrate from its project in the country’s far north to Belgium’s Nyrstar , the two firms said on Monday. As part of the deal, Nyrstar is set to suspend arbitration proceedings that it launched this month related to a historical supply agreement over concentrate from the site, the companies said. That step is pending a formal offtake agreement. Under the deal, New Century will supply 600,000 tonnes of zinc concentrate to Nyrstar over 5-1/2 years for processing into refined metal, the companies said in a joint statement. The firms said the terms of the deal were confidential, but that New Century remained on track for its first zinc concentrate production in the third quarter of this year. “New Century is pleased to establish this offtake with Nyrstar, which is the world’s second largest direct end user of zinc concentrate with smelters located around the world,” New Century Executive Chairman Evan Cranston said in the statement. The global market for mined zinc is facing a supply deficit due to years of underinvestment during the commodities downturn and after several giant mines dried up, heating up demand for zinc mine supply. New Century is set to produce zinc concentrate from the tailings of the giant Century Mine in Australia’s Queensland state, which was closed in 2015 by previous owners China’s MMG. New Century earlier awarded Swiss-based Mercuria Energy Trading and Transamine Trading a tender for about 750,000 tonnes of zinc concentrate, which triggered Nyrstar to file a request for arbitration based on its historical supply agreement. “Nyrstar has traditionally been a significant long term user of Century zinc concentrate,” said Nyrstar Chief Executive Officer Hilmar Rode. “We are very pleased to have secured a new long-term supply agreement and are looking forward to continue our long standing successful relationship with the Century Zinc Mine and its new owners New Century Resources.” For the first 3-1/2 years, the offtake includes a variable tonnage allocation to Nyrstar of 250,000 tonnes of zinc concentrate, rising to 350,000 tonnes for the final two years of the agreement, which represents approximately 15 percent and 35 percent respectively of the scheduled production.

2018-02-26,"SRINAGAR, India, Feb 26 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Half of India’s states and union territories have introduced a blanket ban on plastic bags, and yet many shoppers remain wedded to the flimsy carrier bags while plastic waste still litters the streets of the South Asian nation. In mid-January, Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir became the latest state to prohibit all polythene bags, in accordance with a ruling by its High Court. It joins 17 other states and territories governed by New Delhi that have imposed a complete ban on the sale and use of plastic bags, including Madhya Pradesh and Punjab. Five other states - Goa, Gujarat, Kerala, Odisha and West Bengal - have partial bans on the use of plastic bags around sites of religious, historical or natural importance, or during the pilgrimage season, according to data provided to the Thomson Reuters Foundation by India’s Central Pollution Control Board. Despite this, change is barely visible on the ground. In mountainous Jammu and Kashmir, for example, shopkeepers and vegetable sellers still pack goods in plastic carrier bags before handing them over to customers. “We have been hearing this for a long time - I don’t think (the ban) is going to work,” said Mohammad Yasin, who sells vegetables in Srinagar city’s Zainakote area. The government of Jammu and Kashmir had already banned bags made of polythene - a common form of plastic - with a thickness of less than 50 microns a year ago, but to little effect. “It is not only up to us - the customers share major responsibility. They should carry their own reusable bags. If they do so, the ban will work,” Yasin said. More importantly, the country needs to stop making polythene, he added. Several other shopkeepers the Thomson Reuters Foundation spoke to agreed. “If the government is serious about stopping the use of polythene, it should ban its manufacturing. That will force people to carry their own bags,” said Abdul Rashid, a shopkeeper in Srinagar’s commercial hub, Lal Chowk (Red Square). India’s plastics industry employs about 4 million people, and has more than 30,000 processing units, according to the India Brand Equity Foundation, set up by the government to promote “Made in India” products internationally. Domestic consumption of plastic is expected to reach 20 million metric tonnes per year by 2020, while exports of plastic products were worth $7.64 billion in 2015-16. Srinagar Deputy Commissioner Syed Abid said the Jammu and Kashmir government was committed to stamping out plastic bags. “We have constituted special squads for enforcing the ban, and we are also seizing polythene wherever we find it in use,” he said in an interview. Some environmental experts say carrying plastic bags should be punishable by law. “As of now, only the traders or shopkeepers are penalised - which doesn’t affect people who compel the shopkeepers to provide them with plastic bags,” said Samiullah Bhat, assistant professor in the environmental science department at the University of Kashmir. Riyaz Ahmad Wani, the commissioner of Srinagar Municipal Corporation, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the authority may consider imposing fines on those who carry polythene bags under a new policy for solid waste management now being drafted. In March 2016, the Karnataka state government issued a circular stipulating that no one should use plastic products, including bags, banners, bunting, flags, plates, cups, spoons, cling film and table cloths. It also said those items should not be manufactured, supplied, stored, transported, sold or distributed. Megha Shenoy, a fellow at the Bangalore-based Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), said the ban has had “some impact” there but enforcement is patchy. Civil servants in several departments are tasked with putting it into practice, but proof of their work needs to be collected and verified independently, said Shenoy. Without such a system, responsibility gets shunted between departments, “leading to dilution of enforcement”, she said. Moreover, several political parties – including the ruling party – often use banners, bunting and other plastic products, as bureaucrats struggle to implement the rules, she added. As far back as 2012, two Indian Supreme Court judges warned “the next generation will be threatened with something more serious than the atom bomb” in the absence of “a total ban on plastic”. But progress towards that aspiration is slow. A 2015 report by the Central Pollution Control Board said Indian cities produced more than 15,000 tonnes of plastic waste every day. Of this, 9,000 tonnes were collected and processed, while the rest littered the streets and drains, or was dumped in landfill. About two-thirds of the plastic waste was a mix of polythene bags and food packaging, mainly from residential areas, it said. In 2016, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi noted that cows – a sacred animal for many Indians - were dying after consuming plastic, and urged those concerned about their welfare to stop it happening. According to a June 2017 study published in the journal Nature Communications, 20 rivers - mostly in Asia - carry into the sea about two-thirds of the plastic in the world’s oceans, with the River Ganges crossing India and Bangladesh responsible for the second-highest amount among them. Swati Singh Sambyal, programme manager for environmental governance at the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment, said a ban on plastic bags would only work if their manufacture was stopped and cheaper alternatives made available. “A jute bag or a cloth bag is way beyond the reach of a vendor - only big malls or shops can use them,” she said. Charging for polythene bags is another way to incentivise shoppers to bring reusable bags, while shopkeepers who give out plastic bags should be fined, she added. Meanwhile, she urged cities to start information campaigns. “Behaviour change through mass awareness is imperative,” she said, adding few efforts of this kind have been made so far. ATREE’s Shenoy said citizens could help enforce the ban by using cameras on their smartphones and data collection apps, while the authorities should report publicly on progress. The government could also support start-up businesses that offer sustainable alternatives to plastics, she added. Some companies, for example, are making bags, bin liners and packaging from natural starch, vegetable oil derivatives and vegetable waste, which they say are biodegradable and non-toxic to flora and fauna, although they are still more expensive than their plastic equivalents.

Investors initially took heart from Friday’s rally on Wall Street which saw the VIX volatility index end at 16.49 percent, far below the 50 percent peak touched at the height of market turmoil in early February. The mood has calmed partly thanks to expectations the Federal Reserve will stay gradual in its tightening, a measured outlook underlined by the central bank in a governors’ report released on Friday. Investors also seem to be wagering that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will stick to that script at his first appearance before the House on Tuesday, followed by testimony to the Senate on Thursday. “Powell will be highly cognisant of the spike in risk aversion in late January and will be keen not to rock the boat too greatly,” argued Chris Weston, chief market strategist at broker IG. “Futures markets on Friday were pricing in less implied policy tightening from the Fed in the years ahead, suggesting traders are not expecting Powell to signal a more aggressive response.” Yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries had also backed off to 2.85 percent and away from a four-year top of 2.957 percent. An added wrinkle is that the Fed’s favoured measure of inflation, the core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index, is out early on Thursday. Markets will be hyper-sensitive to any hint of a pick-up in core inflation given the surprising strength of wages in January and Powell is certain to be questioned on the risks by Senators. In currency markets, the U.S. dollar surrendered early gains to dip 0.2 percent on a basket of currencies to 89.730. That followed a 0.8 percent bounce last week. It also retreated on the yen to reach 106.66, failing to hold an early 107.28 top amid selling by Japanese exporters for month-end. The euro was firmer at $1.2314, just above last week’s trough at $1.2258, with ECB President Mario Draghi set to appear before the European Parliament later in the day. Dealers were also looking ahead to the outcome of the Italian general election on March 4. A German Social Democrats’ poll of its members on joining another coalition government with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives is also due that day, two big political risk events for markets. In commodities, the lapse in the dollar helped spot gold bounce 0.6 percent to $1,336.94 per ounce. Oil prices extended gains to hit their highest level in nearly three weeks on Monday, supported by comments from Saudi Arabia that it would continue to curb exports in line with the OPEC-led effort to cut global supplies. U.S. crude futures added 25 cents to $63.80 a barrel, while Brent futures rose 15 cents to $67.46.

2018-02-26,"* Aims to import up to 2 mln tonnes LNG a year to Australia * Group may charter LNG import vessel for $30-$35 mln a year * Targeting sales to major industrial gas users * Aims for investment decision this year, start-up in 2020 (Adds Marubeni, JERA comment) By Sonali Paul MELBOURNE, Feb 26 (Reuters) - A consortium including Japan’s JERA and Marubeni Corp is aiming to ship liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Australia’s east coast, looking to supply industrial gas users and possibly a new power plant, the group said on Monday. This is the second proposed LNG import terminal for Australia, the world’s no.2 LNG exporter, as the country grapples with a supply gap at a time when its gas producers have locked in long-term contracts to sell LNG to Japan, China and South Korea. A final investment decision is expected this year on the project to import up to around 2 million tonnes a year of LNG starting in 2020, James Baulderstone, who is leading the Australian Industrial Energy group, told Reuters. “This market is in quite desperate need for more gas to come in,” said Baulderstone, a former Santos Ltd executive, pointing to soaring energy prices. The LNG receiving terminal would be able to meet up to three-quarters of the gas needs of Australia’s most populous state, New South Wales, where manufacturers like BlueScope Steel and Orica have major operations. Baulderstone said the consortium would probably charter an existing LNG import vessel, at an estimated cost of around $30 million to $35 million a year, rather than building a new floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU). That is a fraction of the billions of dollars that would be needed to develop a new gas field and pipelines to supply the equivalent volume of gas, 100 petajoules a year. “The efficiency of capital is extraordinary because you don’t have to spend that much capital to effectively charter a boat and connect it to the existing east coast grid,” he said. The proposed new LNG import terminal would be located at either Port Botany, Port Kembla and Newcastle, all of which are close to existing gas pipelines, helping to keep down costs. Australian Industrial Energy’s investors, as first reported by the Australian Financial Review, are mining billionaire Andrew Forrest’s Squadron Energy, Marubeni and JERA, the world’s biggest LNG buyer, which is a joint venture of Tokyo Electric Power Co and Chubu Electric Power Co. “Marubeni and JERA believe that this FSRU-based project can be completed and commence the supply of LNG to New South Wales in a timely manner,” the Japanese companies said in a statement. They said they would work with Squadron on the feasibility study, including marketing to potential customers and tapping JERA’s global network to line up LNG supply. Baulderstone and the companies declined to disclose their respective stakes in the consortium. General Electric Co is providing technical support and design services for development and construction of a gas-fired power plant. Australia’s top power generator, AGL Energy, is also considering building an LNG import terminal off neighbouring state of Victoria, to bring in up to 2.5 million tonnes a year, but that would mostly meet its own needs, supplying its gas-fired power stations and households. While LNG is cheap at the moment, prices are expected to rise in the early 2020s, which could make it difficult to justify imports to Australia, said Saul Kavonic, an analyst at consultants Wood Mackenzie. “The economic case for Australian LNG imports remains marginal at best, and is not guaranteed to happen,” he said.

2018-02-26,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Feb 26 - It seems coal miners are adopting one of two disparate strategies, either exit the business in a highly visible way to buff up your climate credentials, or sit tight, keep as quiet as possible and rake in the cash. An example of the public exit from the business is South32 , the Perth-based miner spun out of BHP Billiton which is in the process of selling out of its thermal coal assets in South Africa. Mike Fraser, South32’s president and chief operating office for South Africa, told Reuters earlier this month that the company was aiming to sell its coal assets because it “did not believe in the commodity.” It would also be better if the coal mines were majority-owned by black investors, Fraser said. This is a reasonable recognition that it’s increasingly hard for companies without black investors to do business in South Africa, given its laws and rules aimed at promoting the economic interests of the majority population following centuries of discrimination under first colonial and then white-minority rule. South32 joins Anglo American in getting out of South African coal, with the London-listed miner selling the last of its domestic coal assets to a majority black-owned company in January. Anglo American will continue to export coal from South Africa, but it will no longer be a participant in supplying the domestic market, which is dominated by the state power utility Eskom. Perhaps it’s not surprising that the two major coal asset sales this year are taking place in South Africa, given the ongoing dispute between the government and the mining industry over a new mining charter and the requirements to increase the participation of black investors. But Rio Tinto also decided to exit its Australian coal business, selling out to Yancoal Australia and Glencore. If there is a trend at play here, it’s that diversified miners are the ones most likely to exit coal, and some have cited the risks of being in an increasingly unpopular business. Activists and other investors are ramping up pressure on fund managers and sovereign wealth funds to divest from companies that are in coal. Given coal was a tiny part of Rio’s business, exiting the industry makes sense, especially if you can then tout yourself as a miner of metals that will be part of the electric vehicle and battery revolution. The other choice is to stay in coal and try to mitigate any public backlash. BHP and its alliance partner Mitsubishi are the world’s largest exporters of coking coal, used to make steel, and there are no signs that the miner intends to exit the business. Same goes for Glencore, and both these companies are probably calculating that the monetary rewards from coal still outweigh any public backlash. Benjamin Sporton, chief executive of industry group the World Coal Association, told Reuters in an interview on Monday that there was a positive mood among many coal miners. While Sporton said coal producers acknowledge that the market is shrinking in Europe and faces a huge challenge from cheap natural gas in the United States, Asia is presenting good opportunities. “Our membership see a strong future in Asia,” he said, citing expectations that China and India will remain major importers of both thermal and coking coal, while demand will also be boosted by newer consumers in Asia, such as Vietnam and Pakistan. The absence of major new coal mines and Indonesia reducing exports to fuel domestic demand also means that supply to seaborne markets is likely to be constrained in coming years, even if there is a slowdown in the construction of new coal-fired generators. The reality for many existing coal miners is that conditions now are as good as they have been in living memory. The price of thermal coal is strong, with the Asian thermal benchmark Newcastle Weekly Index ending on Feb. 23 at $110.60 a tonne, the highest in six years. Costs are also down, with the industry having cut every sliver of fat during the five years of declining prices from 2011 to 2015. An example of the strong conditions for coal miners is Australia’s Whitehaven Coal, which on Feb. 16 reported that its first-half underlying profit rose by about 63 percent to A$257.2 million ($204 million). It also paid a dividend for the first time since 2012. For coal miners who can take the heat of the public opinion kitchen these are good times. For those who no longer see coal as part of the future, they can sell out, at prices higher than what they might have expected a few years, and at the same time hopefully gain some climate-change credibility.

Bangladesh’s economic growth soared by 7.28 percent in the financial year that ended in June 2017 and its population is expected to climb to over 185 million people by 2030. Together with Pakistan and India, the country is making South Asia a hotspot for liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand, attracting investment from gas producers and power plant builders after years of the country being considered an energy backwater. “The stock market in Bangladesh is small and our financial demands are much larger... Singapore seems to be becoming a global financial market, so it looks like a good place to list in,” Muhammed Aziz Khan, the chairman of Summit Group, the conglomerate that owns Summit Power, told Reuters in an interview in Singapore. SGX has granted Summit Power eligibility to list on the exchange, Khan said. SGX declined to confirm the company’s eligibility since the exchange does not typically comment on potential listings, a spokeswoman said. Summit Power is likely to be the first Bangladeshi firm to list in Singapore; however, the SGX declined to comment. The company has appointed Citigroup, DBS and UBS as global coordinators, Khan said. However, Khan declined to give a value of the initial public offering (IPO), saying the information was confidential. Summit Power has about a 13 percent share of Bangladesh’s electricity generation market, operating 15 power plants with a combined capacity of about 1,200 megawatts (MW). Summit is also developing Bangladesh’s second floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) to handle LNG imports, with the ability to regasify and add 500 million cubic feet per day (cfd) of natural gas to the national grid. The facility will be located in the Moheshkhali region in the Bay of Bengal is expected to be ready by early next year, said Khan. Overall, the Summit Group conglomerate had revenue last year of around $500 million from the energy unit as well as its other businesses including port services, communications, hospitality and industrial parks. Still, the Summit Power unit plans to invest huge sums in projects over the next five years, including in LNG assets in Bangladesh as well as power projects across Asia, Khan said. “We are looking to invest substantially in the near future and have a robust multi-billion pipeline of projects over the next five years,” he said, without saying how the projects would be funded. Summit, along with Norway’s Hoegh LNG, is also looking to build a regasification unit in the port of Payra, about 194 km (121 miles) south of the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka, that could send out 1 billion cfd of gas, an industry source familiar with the matter said, declining to be named due to the confidentiality of the plans. With up to 30 percent of the over 160 million people in Bangladesh lacking access to electricity, Summit hopes to invest in projects to meet that expected increase in demand, said Khan. Bangladesh will require about 7 million tonnes of LNG by 2022 and similar volumes of coal by 2024, Khan said. “These infrastructure projects are capital intensive and require a lot of money to implement them,” he said. Summit is also looking to expand into power plant projects outside of Bangladesh. It has bid for a 330-MW plant in Sri Lanka and is studying the markets in Vietnam and Indonesia to tap potential growth, Khan said.

2018-02-26,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asia’s booming liquefied natural gas (LNG) market has seen exchanges and commodity price agencies vie to become the region’s leading price benchmark. That race seems over with S&P Global Platts emerging the winner, over rivals including other price reporting agencies and exchanges. With over 70 percent of global LNG consumed in Asia, and growth concentrated in this region, it adds a potentially lucrative business to the company’s already profitable operations providing oil price assessments. Platts says LNG swaps volumes, settled against its Japan Korea Marker (JKM) LNG price assessments, quadrupled in 2017 to 50,266 lots, equivalent to around 170 tankers of LNG and the growth has continued this year. “January 2018 was a record month for JKM derivatives with over 9,500 lots cleared, equivalent to over 31 standard-sized LNG cargoes,” said Dave Ernsberger, head of energy pricing at S&P Global Platts. Platts provides price assessments of spot LNG cargoes traded in Asia and analysts and traders estimate the vast majority of deals are priced using its benchmark. The Intercontinental Exchange, which operates financial and commodities markets, also provides a swaps contract for LNG that uses the Platts benchmark as the price for the underlying asset. More than 9,000 LNG lots were traded in January. Each lot is over 10,000 million British thermal units (mmBtu). “The contract is increasingly seen as the benchmark... for LNG in Asia,” Gordon Bennett, managing director of utility markets at ICE, said in a client note. The CME Group, which operates derivatives markets, has a similar arrangement, although only 265 lots were traded in January on its platform. Early starter advantage - Platts started its JKM in 2009 – and the tie-up with ICE seems to have won Platts the race to be the main supplier of the price marker in Asia, creating critical liquidity that is crucial for any market to develop, according to several senior traders. Other price reporting agencies and exchanges, including Japan’s Tokyo Commodity Exchange (Tocom) and the Singapore Exchange, have vied for a slice of the price-assessment pie but have struggled for significant market share. TOCOM declined to comment, while SGX said there was “strong interest” in its Middle East and India LNG derivatives contract, known as the Dubai/Kuwait/India. A sudden growth in spot trading of LNG in Asia has also been fortuitous for Platts. Most LNG is traded via multi-year supply contracts, but spot trading took off from 2016 and made the need for a price assessment to settle trades more urgent. China’s imports rose rapidly and some newer suppliers to the market were willing to break with traditional long-term supply contracts and provide spot cargoes instead. “Flexible volumes from the U.S. and new supplies from Australia, Papua New Guinea and Africa increased the number of spot transactions,” said U.S. LNG firm Tellurian in a note to clients this month. “The number of participants... increased to around 45, compared with 20-30 at the start if 2017,” Tellurian said. The increased liquidity will fuel further volumes of trading activity, people in the market say. “The ability to enter and more importantly exit trades is critical when trading in financial markets,” said Tobias Davis, head of LNG-Asia at brokerage Tullett Prebon, which also facilitates trade in JKM swaps. “As the JKM benchmark has become more widely adopted, liquidity in the paper (swaps) market has grown exponentially,” he added. China’s surge in demand has ironically left the JKM, named after the dominant LNG importers when it was launched, somewhat misnamed given China’s rise. While Japan remains the world’s biggest LNG importer, China overtook South Korea to become the No.2 buyer last year, and most analysts say it is only a matter of time before China surpasses Japan. Most traders say Platts’ current success is based on the link between its price assessments and the swaps trading on ICE. But if history is a guide, the assessments could lose favour over time as the Asia market develops, Saul Kavonic, principal analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, argues. “If and when a true Asian LNG trading hub and platform evolves, then price discovery will move toward being based on an exchange, and futures will move to exchange-based derivatives contracts, as we’ve seen in Europe and North America where exchange prices like the U.S. Henry Hub or Britain’s National Balance Point, not Platts, dominate the market,” he said. Australian energy and mining giant BHP said this week in its annual outlook that a future global gas market would be “potentially harmonised around the Henry Hub” as U.S. producers export LNG based on this benchmark.

2018-02-26,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico and Canada aim to finish reworking less contentious chapters of the NAFTA trade deal with the United States in new talks that began on Sunday, hoping to clear the path for a breakthrough on the toughest issues before upcoming elections. In six months, negotiators have made progress on the technical details of a revamped North American Free Trade Agreement, but made little advance on strong demands for change made by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Ranging from calls for major changes to automotive content rules and dispute resolution mechanisms, to imposing a clause that could automatically kill NAFTA after five years, the chief stumbling blocks laid by the White House look unlikely to be removed in the latest Mexico City round, officials said. Trump frequently threatens to walk away from NAFTA unless big changes are made to a pact he blames for U.S. manufacturing job losses. “I think there’s going to be major progress on the technical issues and major obstacles on the critical issues,” Bosco de la Vega, head of the Mexico’s National Agricultural Council farm lobby, said of the talks running until March 5. Once agreement is reached on technical chapters such as state-owned enterprises, barriers to trade and e-commerce, about 10 percent of the modernized accord would eventually be left over for political leaders to work out, de la Vega estimated. A schedule for the latest round showed that the discussions for the first three days would include rules of origin, an issue at the heart of the Trump administration’s demand to raise the amount of auto content sourced from the NAFTA region. Under NAFTA, at least 62.5 percent of the net cost of a passenger car or light truck must originate in the region to avoid tariffs. Trump wants the threshold raised to 85 percent. “You can’t have a successful negotiation if there’s no change to the rules of origin,” said a Mexican official, speaking on condition of anonymity, adding: “It won’t be 85 percent. We’re not sure what the number is going to be.” Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo has said his negotiating team aims to present a proposal on rules of origin, although he has not provided details. On Sunday evening, the Mexican official told Reuters: “We don’t have a counterproposal yet.” Any final agreement would need to be reached between Trump and auto-sector leaders in the United States who oversee the NAFTA region, an industry source close to the process said. The North American auto industry has pushed back against Trump’s demands, arguing they would damage competitiveness and regional supply chains. Mexico aims to build on the previous round in Montreal, when Canada floated proposals to address U.S. demands, including one to include costs for engineering, research and development and other items in the total value of an auto. The schedule showed that several chapters that negotiators have signaled are close to concluding, including e-commerce, telecommunications and energy, are up for discussion toward the end of the round. Financial services will last for three days. The latest round comes amid flare-ups between Washington and Ottawa and growing, if cautious, optimism in Mexico that the trade agreement will remain. Talks are running behind schedule and some officials believe the longer they last, the less likely it is that Trump will dump NAFTA. Negotiators had wanted to wrap up talks by March to avoid them being politicized by Mexico’s July presidential election. U.S. congressional elections in November could also complicate the talks. But officials have raised the possibility that they will run past Mexico’s vote, and some said they could continue at a technical level for several months if necessary. A U.S. official said: “There has never been a hard deadline,” and belief is growing among Mexicans following the process that lobbying efforts by U.S. business leaders and politicians to preserve NAFTA have been gaining traction. The office of Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton on Friday published a letter sent this month to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in which he urged him to “preserve and expand market access” under NAFTA, and build on existing ties. While pledging to stay in the talks, Canada’s chief negotiator, Steve Verheul, struck a downbeat tone last week, telling a business audience: “There are large gaps between what we’re trying to achieve and what the U.S. is trying to achieve.” Additional reporting by Dave Graham and Adriana Barrera in Mexico City, Lesley Wroughton in Washington and David Ljunggren in Ottawa; Editing by Susan Thomas and Peter Cooney",https://uk.reuters.com/article/trade-nafta/update-2-new-nafta-talks-aim-to-clear-pathway-to-toughest-issues-idUKL2N1QF0A3,26 Feb 2018,"Mexico and Canada aim to

A German Social Democrats’ poll of its members on joining another coalition government with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives is also due that day, two big political risk events for markets. In commodities, spot gold was a fraction softer at $1,327.60 per ounce. Oil prices were underpinned by the shutdown of the El Feel oilfield in Libya and upbeat comments from Saudi Arabia that an OPEC-led effort to cut stockpiles is working.

2018-02-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May will cap the energy bills of 11 million British households for as long as five years under a new law introduced to parliament on Monday, aimed at tackling what she describes as “rip-off” energy prices. The new legislation will force the energy regulator Ofgem to cap electricity and gas prices until 2020 when the regulator will recommend whether it should be extended on an annual basis up to 2023, the government said. The government said that some customers are being charged more than 300 pounds than they should be, and the cap will apply to expensive plans that customers are moved to when their cheaper fixed deals end. “It’s often older people or those on low incomes who are stuck on rip-off energy tariffs, so today we are introducing legislation to force energy companies to change their ways,” May said. “Our energy price cap will cut bills for millions of families. This is another step we are taking to help people make ends meet as we build a country that works for everyone.” A report by a committee of lawmakers earlier this month found that the current energy market is “broken” and penalises customer loyalty. Home power bills have doubled in Britain over the past decade to an average of about 1,150 pounds a year. The energy company Centrica (CNA.L) said while it agreed that standard variable rates are a problem for customers because they have no end dates, price controls are the wrong solution. “We just do not agree with introducing price controls into a competitive market which will reduce competition and choice, and therefore impact consumers,” the company said in a statement.

2018-02-26,"TOKYO, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Oil prices held little changed near two-week highs early on Monday, supported by comments from Saudi Arabia that it would continue to curb exports in line with the OPEC-led effort to cut global supplies. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery was up 2 cents at $63.57 a barrel by 2340 GMT, after rising 3 percent last week. London Brent crude eased 4 cents to $67.27, after gaining nearly 4 percent last week. Saudi Arabia hopes OPEC and its allies will be able to relax production curbs next year and create a permanent framework to stabilise oil markets after the current supply cut deal ends this year, its oil minister said on Saturday in New Delhi. In January-March, Saudi Arabia’s oil production would be well below the production cap, with exports averaging below 7 million barrels per day (bpd), Saudi Arabian oil minister Khalid al-Falih said. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers including Russia have been cutting output to support oil prices. U.S. energy companies last week added one oil rig, the fifth weekly increase in a row, bringing the total count up to 799, the highest level since April 2015, Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. Hedge funds and money managers upped their bullish wagers on U.S. crude oil for the first time in four weeks, data showed on Friday. Libya’s National Oil Corp said on Saturday it had declared force majeure on the 70,000 bpd El Feel oilfield after a protest by guards closed the field.
