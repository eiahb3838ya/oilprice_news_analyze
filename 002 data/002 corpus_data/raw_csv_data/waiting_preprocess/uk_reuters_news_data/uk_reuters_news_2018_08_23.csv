2018-08-23,"LONDON, Aug 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Leaders of some of the world’s biggest cities vowed on Thursday to make all buildings carbon neutral by 2050, ensuring they make no contribution to climate change. From London to Tokyo, 19 mayors said they would put in place regulations requiring all new buildings to be carbon neutral by 2030 and all existing ones to reach the same goal by 2050. “Climate change poses an existential threat to New York City, and making our buildings more sustainable and efficient is a key part of the solution,” said Mayor of New York Bill de Blasio in a statement. Houses, offices and other buildings account for more than half of all planet-warming gasses emitted by urban areas, according to C40 Cities, a network of cities pushing climate action that shepherded the latest commitment. In London, Los Angeles and Paris, the share is as high as 70 percent of all greenhouse emissions, it said. “Paris is home to some of the world’s most beautiful and iconic buildings ...  we recognise our responsibility to ensure every building, whether historic or brand new, helps deliver a sustainable future,” said Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo. Experts said the target was feasible, but that more cities would have to follow suit if the world was to achieve the Paris climate goals. The 2015 Paris Agreement set a goal of limiting a rise in average world surface temperatures to “well below” 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times, while “pursuing efforts” to limit rising temperatures to 1.5C (2.7F). “The biggest challenge is ensuring that developers avoid cutting corners to save relatively small amounts in construction today, by passing retrofit costs onto future owners,” said Eric Lounsbury, director of environmental consultancy Carbon Trust. “To achieve the ambitions of the Paris Agreement we will need all buildings to be net zero emissions by the middle of this century,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Buildings that are net carbon neutral are powered by renewable sources and consume little energy, typically using LED lights, winter insulation and roof-top solar panels. “Buildings are a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, so to meet reductions set out in the Paris Agreement, it’s critical that we tackle this problem,” said Helen Clarkson, head of The Climate Group, a charity promoting climate action. The pledge was signed by London, Copenhagen, Johannesburg, Los Angeles, Montreal, New York City, Newburyport, Paris, Portland, San Francisco, San Jose, Santa Monica, Stockholm, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto, Tshwane, Vancouver and Washington DC.

2018-08-23,"* Johan Sverdrup set to start production in late 2019 * At peak could make up 25 pct of total Norway petroleum output * No other giant oilfield found off Norway since Sverdrup By Nerijus Adomaitis JOHAN SVERDRUP PLATFORM, North Sea, Aug 23 (Reuters) - N orway’s Equinor sees scope to further reduce development costs at the Johan Sverdrup oilfield in the North Sea, as it looks to maximise the potential of what could be the last giant field to be found off the Nordic country. The field, one of the five largest oil finds offshore Norway, is estimated to contain up to 3.1 billion barrels of oil equivalents, mainly crude oil, enough to meet Britain’s oil demand for five years. Sverdrup is on track to begin production in late 2019 and could produce up to a quarter of Norway’s overall petroleum output at its peak. Equinor, formerly Statoil, has already cut development costs by 35 billion crowns ($4.1 billion) to 88 billion crowns, thanks to more efficient drilling and smooth execution that meant cash put aside for contingencies has not been used. “I think there are still some further gains on the cost side,” Margareth Oevrum, Equinor’s executive president for technology, project and drilling, told Reuters. Oevrum was speaking at the Sverdrup drilling platform, one of two already in place in the North Sea, some 160 km (100 miles) west of the Norwegian coast. Workers were connecting pipes, laying cables and testing equipment in heavy wind and rain, part of the 800 staff currently offshore to complete construction. The remaining two platforms are expected to be delivered to the field in spring 2019. During the first stage of development, Sverdrup is expected to produce up to 440,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day (boepd), while the second phase, scheduled to start in 2022, is expected to boost output to 660,000 boepd. State-controlled Equinor is expected to submit a plan for the field’s second phase, estimated to cost a preliminary 45 billion crowns, later this month. “Going forward this will be the biggest oilfield producing on the Norwegian continental shelf,” said Oevrum. Sverdrup’s significance in terms of oil output could be even higher. Oil pricing agency S&P Global Platts has said output from the field would be suitable for its North Sea basket, making it potentially a sixth crude underpinning the Brent benchmark , used to price most global oil. The field also helped sustain demand for industry suppliers during the 2015 oil downturn, with Equinor and partners Lundin Petroleum, Aker BP, Petoro and Total awarding contracts worth over 60 billion crowns. “I lost my job when the (oil) crisis came, and I got it back, when this project started, so I am very happy,” said Stian Simonsen, 30, a pipe fitter working at Sverdrup. The field is named after a 19th century Norwegian prime minister. But there may not be another Sverdrup to help the Norwegian oil industry in the years ahead. “I can’t see anything larger for the future ... We have Johan Castberg, but it’s not as big as Johan Sverdrup,” Oevrum said, referring to Equinor’s oilfield development in the Arctic. “We are still positive about exploration and will explore more, but at the moment we don’t have anything.” Oevrum herself will soon leave Norway for Brazil to supervise the development of the Equinor-operated Carcara discovery, which is of a similar size to Sverdrup. While Norway still accounts for about two-thirds of Equinor’s total petroleum output, its international operations have been hitting new quarterly records. “The Norwegian continental shelf has been the backbone of Equinor for many years, and it will continue for some time, but it will be gradually replaced by the international production,” Oevrum said. $1 = 8.4525 Norwegian crowns

2018-08-23,"MELBOURNE, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The risk of blackouts in Australia’s upcoming summer has grown from last year as ageing coal-fired power plants have become less reliable, the nation’s energy market operator said on Friday, calling for more power investment in the next few years. The Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) latest outlook underscores worries about the country’s grid just days after the government’s signature energy policy to boost power reliability, lower emissions and cut prices collapsed amid political turmoil. “Close collaboration with industry in the lead up and throughout summer will be key to reducing the risks of energy supply shortfalls,” AEMO Managing Director Audrey Zibelman said in a statement. Australia’s southeastern states suffered a string of blackouts in 2016 and 2017, the worst of which hit the entire state of South Australia and shut global miner BHP’s Olympic Dam copper mine for two weeks, costing it $105 million. AEMO sees the states of Victoria and South Australia most at risk of outages in the 2018-19 summer, which runs from December through February, with some risk in the most populous state, New South Wales, where a severe drought could deplete hydropower. Electricity demand typically jumps over the summer as households and businesses crank up air conditioning. The Bureau of Meteorology has not issued its forecast for this summer yet, but has said that temperatures this spring are likely to be warmer than average. “The forecast risk of load-shedding in 2018-19 has increased since the 2017 (outlook), primarily because modelling has now factored in a reduction in thermal generation reliability observed in recent years,” AEMO said. Unexpected outages at coal-fired plants have forced Australia’s biggest power user, the Tomago aluminium smelter, partly owned by Rio Tinto, to cut output several times this year, as it looked to avoid sharp price spikes when Sydney was on the verge of blackouts. “(Without shoring up reserves), there would be a risk of involuntary load-shedding during summer peak periods in Victoria from this summer, in New South Wales from 2023-24 and in South Australia from 2024-25,” AEMO said. AEMO is repeating steps from last summer when it lined up back-up supply and paid big energy users to cut energy use at times when the system was short on supply. As Australia’s ageing coal-fired generators, which supply more than 70 percent of the market’s electricity, get closer to retiring starting in 2022, the market will need to find new sources beyond those already planned to avert outages. “The results emphasise the need for an investment landscape which supports the development of the portfolio of resources required to replace retiring generation,” AEMO said.

2018-08-23,"KIEV, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Ukraine, which wants to resume cooperation with the International Monetary Fund, may need to increase household gas prices, Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman was quoted as saying on Thursday. Earlier this month the government extended a freeze on gas prices until at least Sept. 1, reducing its prospects of securing more money from the IMF which is needed to keep its war-battered economy on a stable footing. “You know that there are obligations that (our) gas prices will rise in conditions of rising global gas prices. I have been restraining this situation for a year. However, now there is a question of another increase,” Interfax Ukraine news agency quoted Groysman as saying during his trip to western Ukraine. “This requirement arose because we need to work with external borrowings”, he added. Ukraine must raise gas prices to market levels in order to qualify for more aid under a $17.5 billion IMF program. It initially agreed to raise prices under a jointly agreed formula but has since postponed the increases a number of times. Ukraine hasn’t received any money from the IMF since April 2017 due to a slowdown in the pace of reforms. That has put the country in a more financially precarious situation as it must repay around $15 billion of foreign currency debt in the next two years. The government may shy away from potentially unpopular measures like gas price hikes with presidential and parliamentary elections due next year but said talks with the IMF were continuing.

2018-08-23,"(Adds detail, updates prices) * World stocks edge lower, European shares edge up * Fresh round of U.S.-China trade tariffs take effect * Trump threatened by legal woes of two former advisers * Dollar snaps losing streak after Fed signal Sept rate hike By Kit Rees LONDON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - World stocks came under pressure on Thursday as new tariffs took effect in the U.S./China trade war and markets speculated about U.S. President Donald Trump’s position following legal rulings against two former advisers. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was 0.1 percent lower by 1116 GMT, while a rise across tech and energy stocks helped Europe’s STOXX 600 eke out a 0.1 percent gain. Stocks were subdued as the U.S. and China, despite ongoing talks, implemented 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion worth of each other’s goods. The world’s two biggest economic powers have now slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on a combined $100 billion of products since early July, with more in the pipeline, adding to risks to global economic growth. Caroline Simmons, deputy head of the UK chief investment office at UBS Wealth Management, cited such concerns as a reason for paring back an overweight on global equities to a very small position. “We’ve got trade conflicts, and sanctions, in Turkey and Russia, so there are a few things going on that we were a little nervous about,” Simmons said, though her firm still saw upside to equity markets, with good fundamentals. The auto sector, particularly sensitive to tariff developments, was the worst performing in Europe, down 0.9 percent. Earlier, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index stumbled 0.5 percent while Chinese blue-chips gained 0.4 percent. While investors are looking ahead to see how increasing trade barriers between China and the United States might affect corporate earnings, political turmoil also weighed. Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations on Tuesday and former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was found guilty on charges of tax and bank fraud. Investors are considering whether the twin setback will hurt the president and his Republican Party’s prospects in mid-term elections. That weighed on Wall Street overnight and the market ended mixed despite the S&P500 clocking its longest bull run in history. E-Minis for the S&P 500 were also subdued on Thursday, trading flat. Cohen’s plea deal does not mean the president has been implicated in anything, press secretary Sarah Sanders said at a White House briefing. “While the (legal issues) shouldn’t substantially alter the stock market landscape, money managers and analysts say the developments raise the likelihood of further turbulence ahead for Mr. Trump heading into the mid-term elections,” said James McGlew, Perth-based analyst at stockbroking firm Argonaut. Political tensions were not limited to the United States. Australian shares slipped 0.3 percent after several senior ministers tendered their resignations on Thursday and demanded a second vote on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership. The Australian dollar fell 0.8 percent for its second straight day of declines. The political uncertainty helped the dollar snap a five-day losing streak, with the greenback in demand after the Federal Reserve suggested that a rate hike for September was on the cards. The dollar index, which measures it against a basket of major currencies, gave up some earlier gains but still added 0.1 percent to 95.238, pulling off its lowest in three weeks. The euro was off 0.1 percent at $1.1580, not far from Wednesday’s two-week high of $1.1623. The Japanese yen weakened 0.2 percent to 110.77 per dollar. A stronger dollar put pressure on commodities. U.S. gold futures for December delivery fell 0.5 percent while spot gold dipped 0.4 percent to $1,190.49 an ounce. Copper slid 0.9 percent. Oil prices clawed back earlier losses. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded flat at $74.79 while U.S. crude rose to $67.97.

2018-08-23,"VAXJO, Sweden (Reuters) - Ringed by forests in southern Sweden, the city of Vaxjo is thriving even as it cuts greenhouse gas emissions at rates more typical of economic crashes in recessions or wars. It is a radical example of tackling climate change by cutting the use of fossil fuels, offering a glimpse of how the world could stay within warming limits which U.N. scientists say are needed to avoid significant environmental damage. Vaxjo’s power plant runs on biomass from timber. In winter, snow plows clear bicycle paths before roads to discourage cars, and political parties all back a target of making the city fossil-fuel free by 2030 to eliminate carbon dioxide emissions from oil, natural gas and coal. Around the world, governments are struggling to meet their various pledges to cut emissions under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, amid unease about heat waves, droughts, and wildfires that have raged this summer from Greece to California. Leading climate scientists are set to warn governments in October that global carbon emissions from energy use will have to plunge by up to seven percent a year to meet Paris’ toughest goals - unless they develop technologies to suck carbon from the air, according to a draft U.N. report obtained by Reuters. Extreme falls are usually known only from World Wars, the 1930s Great Depression or in Russia, where emissions plunged 16 percent in the year after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. Coal-dependent emerging economies led by China and India are all raising energy use to end poverty and developed countries are wary of sacrificing growth for the environment. What works in a city in a rich, stable Nordic democracy is not an easy blueprint. Still, isolated examples like Vaxjo, a city of 66,000 inhabitants where the twin-spired red medieval cathedral contrasts with ultra-modern wooden buildings, are intriguing for policymakers since it has cut emissions and continued to grow. Bo Frank, president of the city council and an architect of the green shift, said his advice boiled down to: “Heavy, heavy tax increase on fossil energy and reduce the tax on all kinds of renewable energy.” Per capita, Vaxjo says carbon dioxide emissions have fallen by 58 percent from 1993-2016, to 1.9 tonnes from 4.5, while local gross domestic product (GDP) rose 32 percent from 1993-2014, according to the latest available figures. The trajectory is uneven, but equates to an annual rate of emissions cuts of 3.7 percent with 1.33 percent growth. By contrast, worldwide carbon emissions rose by two percent last year to a record high of almost five tonnes per capita, according to scientists who compile a Global Carbon Budget..  Vaxjo aims to eliminate carbon emissions from fossil fuels by 2030 - in homes, industry and transport including planes taking off from the local airport. It says its accounting follows U.N. guidelines, treating the municipality as if it were a mini-country. The city estimates that carbon dioxide from fossil fuels accounts for 65 percent of the municipality’s greenhouse gases. Vaxjo has cut other gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, by 42 percent since 1993 but has not yet set deadlines for phasing them out. Thanks to the early green start, Vaxjo’s carbon cuts are far ahead of the timetable set by almost 200 nations in the Paris climate agreement to phase out net emissions of all greenhouse gases sometime from 2050-2100. Sweden as a whole has also cut emissions while sustaining strong economic growth. The country of 10 million tops international environmental rankings and imposes the world’s highest carbon tax, of up to 137 euros ($158.84) a tonne. “The notion that a carbon tax is harmful for the economy in any country is a political notion. Not a factual notion,” said Swedish Environment Minister Karolina Skog, of the Green Party.    The burning of biomass also emits carbon dioxide but can be made carbon neutral by planting new forests, as in Vaxjo, which absorb the gas to grow.  Almost no countries have forests covering two-thirds of the country like Sweden, but Skog noted that all nations have some form of renewable energy, such as solar or wind power. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) says Sweden produces $11.13 of GDP for every kilo of carbon emissions, almost three times the average for rich nations of $3.91. Skog cited companies like flat-pack furniture group IKEA, which aims to be “climate positive” by 2030, to show that strong environmental goals do not undermine profits but said “we have not yet completely decoupled our economy from carbon emissions”. The nation’s greenhouse gas emissions fell 26 percent between 1990-2016, but the rate of decline has slowed in recent years; Rolf Lindahl of Greenpeace said Sweden was doing better than most but not enough in terms of phasing out fossil fuels. Wildfires have made the environment a big issue in elections due on Sept. 9, with most parties pledging tougher action on climate change. The anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats, who oppose Sweden taking a global lead in cutting greenhouse gas emissions because of fears it could slow the economy, are expected to make the biggest gains with an expected fifth of the vote. But mainstream parties on left and right have ruled out cooperating with them.  The Paris agreement set a goal of limiting the rise in average global temperatures to “well below” two degrees Celsius (3.6F) above pre-industrial times, while “pursuing efforts” for 1.5 (2.7F). Temperatures are already up by about 1C. As part of the Paris deal, world leaders asked scientists to write a report about ways to achieve the 1.5C goal, a goal that many experts say is unrealistic. The draft by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to be unveiled in South Korea in October, acknowledges “there is no documented historical precedent” to limit warming to 1.5C but outlines four possible ways to do it. Three rely heavily on unproven technologies for extracting carbon dioxide from nature and burying it. A “low energy demand” (LED) scenario is the only one to focus solely on rapid cuts in emissions and an acceleration of planting forests to absorb more greenhouse gases. Arnulf Gruebler, of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Vienna, the lead author of the LED, said the rise of the internet in recent years showed that new technologies can abruptly transform economies. Smart phones, for instance, could reduce energy demand if they replace cameras, radios, telephones, clocks, televisions and music players rather than being an extra gadget.     But many say the LED scenario is also pie-in-the-sky. Christian Azar, a professor of energy and the environment at Chalmers University in Gothenburg, said it would probably require unpopular restrictions on driving, flying, even diets. “I don’t think that’s going to happen,” he said. U.S. President Donald Trump, who says he doubts climate change is primarily driven by man-made emissions, plans to pull out of the Paris agreement, asserting that it will undermine the economy. So far, the deepest national cuts in emissions delivered by peacetime policies, according to a study in the journal Nature Climate Change, were 4.5 percent a year in Sweden from 1976-86 after oil price spikes drove the nation to adopt nuclear power. Spurred by the oil shocks, Vaxjo was one of the first Swedish cities to build a district heating plant run on biomass in 1980, pumping hot water around the city and generating electricity. After the oil crises “we realized we live virtually in the woodshed,” said Henrik Johansson, environmental coordinator at Vaxjo municipality. “It was a win-win.”  Local forest owners producing timber earned extra money from selling waste branches, sawdust and bark to fuel the new power plant. The forest owners then paid more taxes, enriching the municipality. Overall, Sweden’s green shift was eased by a lack of a strong oil or coal lobby, even though it does have a big, energy-dependent steel industry and car makers such as Volvo. In Vaxjo, buses run on biogas, bus routes are altered to stop at new housing developments even before they are built and changes to building codes are being planned to limit new parking spaces. The city is also upgrading insulation in older buildings and has decreed that 50 percent of all new municipal buildings will be made of wood by 2020. An urban garden near the center grows tomatoes, squash, pumpkins and sunflowers. Sweden’s local municipalities have huge power, raising taxes and spending about 70 percent of all public money on everything from education to pensions. “In Sweden we have very high taxes and we are also the most decentralized country in the world. So what I say happens,” said Mayor Anna Tenje, of the ruling mainstream conservative Moderate Party. It is not always popular. Frank, president of the city council, said Vaxjo’s strong line on the environment had led a satirical newspaper to describe him as the head of a “green fascist state”. And not everything is on track. Gleaming new bicycle racks for commuters at Vaxjo railway station were mostly empty one recent day. Tenje said the biggest headache was persuading people in rural areas to forsake cars run on diesel or gasoline, making the fossil-free goal hard to reach. “We will achieve the goal but maybe it won’t be by 2030,” she said. “Maybe it will take until 2035.”  ($1 = 9.1841 Swedish crowns) Additional reporting by Niklas Pollard in Stockholm; editing by Philippa Fletcher",https://uk.reuters.com/article/climatechange-economy/insight-imitate-vaxjo-as-heat-rises-swedish-city-goes-green-and-thrives-idUKL5N1UY599,23 Aug 2018,"* Vaxjo cuts greenhouse gas emissions sharply as economy

2018-08-23,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union agreed 18 million euros (£16.1 million) in aid for Iran on Thursday, including for the private sector, to help offset the impact of U.S. sanctions and salvage a 2015 deal that saw Tehran limit its nuclear ambitions. The announcement is part of the bloc’s high-profile efforts to support the nuclear accord that President Donald Trump abandoned in May. It is part of a wider package of 50 million euros earmarked for Iran in the EU budget.   The EU is working to maintain trade with Iran, which has threatened to stop complying with the nuclear agreement if it fails to see the economic benefits of relief from sanctions. The bloc’s foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said in a statement the bloc was committed to cooperation with Iran. “This new package will widen economic and sectoral relations in areas that are of direct benefit to our citizens,” she said. The bloc will spend 8 million euros on the Islamic Republic’s private sector, including assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises and Iran’s Trade Promotion Organisation.

While Danes have mostly enjoyed an unusually sunny summer, the farming sector, a cornerstone in the country’s rise to prosperity, says weather-related losses could exceed $1.2 billion this year. High growth rates at several of the country’s largest firms, which helped the nation recover from the 2008 financial crisis, are also fading. Diabetes drug maker Novo Nordisk, wind turbine maker Vestas, toy maker Lego and jewellery maker Pandora have all seen sales growth slow in the last couple of years. Danish gross domestic product grew 2.3 percent last year, roughly in line with neighbours Sweden and Germany, to 2,150 billion Danish crowns ($330 billion), a growth rate that isn’t seen as achievable in 2018. “We won’t get above 1.5 percent this year, if the figures we’ve seen so far from the statistics office are accurate,” said Jan Storup Nielsen, chief analyst at Nordea. Chief economist at Arbejdernes Landsbank, Signe Roed-Frederiksen, is even more pessimistic, forecasting only around 1 percent growth this year. Exports have been dented by a strengthening of the euro-pegged Danish crown versus the currencies of key export markets Sweden and Britain. Exports could be further hurt by potential escalations of global trade conflicts. After a few years above its long-term growth trend of around 1.7 percent the Danish economy is losing momentum now, said Lars Christensen, economist and CEO of Markets & Money Advisory. “We’re not facing a crisis, but we should be cautious not to expect that the growth rates we’ve seen will continue,” Christensen said. Danske Bank said that labour shortages also threaten to put a brake on growth as the economy gets closer to its maximum capacity. “Although the current growth is not impressive it does demand an increase in employment of 3-4,000 persons each month. We can’t keep that up,” chief economist Las Olsen said. Danish net unemployment is at 3.2 percent, the lowest level since 2009. In the second quarter wages grew by 2.6 percent on the year, the highest growth rate since 2010. New consumer confidence figures, released on Thursday, show Danes remain relatively optimistic despite the potential slowdown, suggesting that consumer spending, another key pillar of the economy, will hold up for the time being. Last year’s GDP was boosted by a one-off payment for a patent from a foreign company to a Danish company. Adjusted for that Danish growth figures would have been around 0.4 percent higher this year.

2018-08-23,"* U.S. Eagle Ford, Australian Wheatstone to arrive Oct-Nov * Steps up Australian imports, seeks European supplies * To continue importing heavy naphtha for splitters (Adds details) By Jane Chung and Seng Li Peng SEOUL/SINGAPORE, Aug 23 (Reuters) - South Korea’s Hanwha Total Petrochemical Co Ltd has increased imports of condensate from the United States and Australia and is seeking more European cargoes to replace Iranian supplies, two industry sources said on Thursday. The move is in line with other South Korean refiners that have replaced Iranian oil with similar imports. The petrochemical producer bought 1 million barrels of U.S. Eagle Ford condensate for November arrival, and it has also stepped up imports from Australia, recently buying Wheatstone condensate for October delivery, the sources said. The purchases were part of Hanwha Total’s efforts to replace Iranian condensate ahead of renewed sanctions on Iran in November, one of the sources said. The sources declined to be named as they were not authorized to speak to media. South Korean refiners and petrochemical producers suspended shipments of Iranian crude and condensate in July, halting all shipments for the first time in six years amid U.S. pressure to cut all imports from Iran from November. South Korea in turn increased its condensate imports from Australia and will lift two 650,000-barrel cargoes of North West Shelf (NWS) condensate in August, the highest volume since March 2015, trade flows data on Thomson Reuters Eikon showed. South Korean companies have also bought NWS condensate loading in September and October, several trade sources said. South Korean banks have halted payment for Iranian oil ahead of the U.S. sanctions that will take effect from November, although Seoul is still working to get a waiver from Washington to import some oil from Iran, other industry sources said. Before the suspensions, South Korea had been the largest buyer of Iranian South Pars condensate (SPC) with imports as high as 6 million barrels in June 2017. The condensate, or ultra light oil, is typically processed at refining units known as splitters to extract heavy naphtha for aromatics production. The loss of Iranian supplies meant Korean buyers had to find and settle for other sources of oil that are not great replacements for SPC as their heavy naphtha yields are lower, trade sources said. In addition to using substitute condensates, South Korean petrochemical companies, such as Hanwha Total, have also been ramping up imports of cheaper heavy naphtha, they said. Hanwha Total has been importing an average of 250,000 tonnes of heavy full-range naphtha a month this year versus 150,000 tonnes a month in 2017, traders said. It paid a $3-a-tonne premium to Japan quotes on a cost-and-freight (C&F) basis for heavy full-range naphtha on Tuesday, down from this year’s high of nearly $17 a tonne.

2018-08-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - Two of Iran’s biggest OPEC rivals, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, are bagging its European oil market share by cranking up production of their lookalike crude grades before the restart of U.S. sanctions designed to halt exports from the Islamic Republic. Iran faces curbs on its energy sector from early November after U.S. President Donald Trump walked away in May from a 2015 deal aimed at restraining Tehran’s nuclear program. Iran’s crude is mainly bought by refiners in China, India, Japan and South Korea, although it has customers in Turkey and the European Union. Buyers seeking an alternative cannot simply opt for any crude on the market.  “As oil sanctions against Iran take effect, perhaps in combination with production problems elsewhere, maintaining global supply might be very challenging and would come at the expense of maintaining an adequate spare capacity cushion,” the International Energy Agency warned recently. [IEA/M] “Thus, the market outlook could be far less calm at that point than it is today,” the Paris-based IEA said.  A senior Iranian diplomat told producer group OPEC on Aug. 19 that no member country should be allowed to take over another’s share of oil exports, in light of Saudi Arabia’s offer to produce more to cover any Iranian shortfalls. But a look at trade flows shows that in Europe at least, Saudi Arabia and Iraq have already succeeded in doing so. Since the start of the year, Iranian flows to Europe have fallen 35 percent to around 415,000 barrels per day (bpd), while Saudi shipments have doubled and those from Iraq have risen 30 percent, according to Reuters flows and ship-tracking data. “Saudi, Basra, Urals,” one refiner said when asked what crude grades were likely alternatives, the latter two hailing from Iraq and Russia respectively. Iraq and Saudi Arabia have raised their oil output by a combined 245,000 bpd since the start of the year and cut the official selling prices for their light crudes for customers in Asia. Iran is the world’s fifth-largest oil exporter and with as much as 1.5 million bpd of supply estimated to be under threat, its customers may be forced to pay handsomely for possible replacements. Crude oil is categorized mainly according to sulfur content and its density relative to water, or American Petroleum Institute gravity. The denser crude is, the lower its gravity.  Crudes that have an API gravity above 35 degrees are categorized as “light”, while those with API gravity between 25 and 35 degrees are “medium” and below 25 degrees, “heavy”.  The lighter the crude, the easier and cheaper it is to extract and transport and the simpler it is to refine. Heavier crudes, which contain more impurities such as sulfur or metals, require additional processing to recover higher-value products. Sulfur content is a second key category. A “sweet” crude is one with a sulfur content of less than 0.5 percent, while the sulfur content of a “sour” crude is above this threshold. Sulfur is corrosive and refineries that run more sour grades require more intense maintenance. The average API for OPEC’s crudes is 33, compared with an average of 35.7 for U.S. grades. Shale, the fastest-growing type of U.S. crude, is lighter still.  (Graphic: Major crude oil grades by type - reut.rs/2OH67XX) Iran Light is a medium sour crude, meaning that shale, however abundant and cheap, cannot act as a replacement on its own. Most refineries worldwide are tooled to run crudes with an API of 32, according to one source at a major European refiner. (Graphic: EIA diagram of a conventional oil refinery - reut.rs/2L0yii9) Refineries regularly blend different types of crude to get as close as possible to their optimal intake.  (Graphic: Major international crude oil grades - reut.rs/2OUtWeI) The impact on the more sour crudes is already apparent. Prices for physical barrels oil have generally declined over the second half of this year, but Russian Urals, British Forties and Angolan Girassol, all sour, are the top-performing grades from around the Atlantic Basin, having lost around 4 percent. That compares with losses of 5-6 percent for lighter, sweeter crudes such as Norwegian Ekofisk or Nigeria’s Bonny Light.

2018-08-23,"* Miner buoyed by high prices for manganese, alumina, metcoal * Alumina market seen tight in the near term, supporting prices * Illawarra coal to ramp back above 8 mln T mark in 2020 (Adds CEO comment in para) By Melanie Burton MELBOURNE, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Australia’s South32 Ltd posted on Thursday a 16 percent rise in its annual underlying earnings, as healthy demand for manganese and alumina helped offset tepid output at its Illawarra coal project. The world’s largest manganese miner’s underlying earnings jumped to $1.33 billion from $1.15 billion the previous year, better than analysts’ expectations of around $1.32 billion. Analysts said South 32’s profit had been lifted by large gains in spot prices for its key commodities, such as manganese, alumina and metallurgical coal, while the miner had managed to keep a better-than-expected lid on costs. “People’s expectations were that costs were going to be an issue, and they weren’t as bad as people made out,” said an analyst at a fund who declined to be named. Comments on the alumina market, which is expected to remain tight into next year due to supply disruptions, were the other major positive from the earnings, said the analyst. South32 shares soared by more than 7 percent to end up 4.9 percent at A$3.42 ($2.50). Manganese prices SMM-EMM-USD have surged nearly 60 percent year-to-date as steel margins have jumped, while alumina prices have climbed by a third after Hydro’s Alunorte in Brazil halved output from February. “This really is ... the time for (our alumina) business to shine,” Chief Executive Graeme Kerr said on an earnings call to analysts. “We are very happy with production performance this year... that has driven strong financial results this year together with prices to mitigate some inflationary cost pressures,” Kerr said. Underlying operating earnings from South32’s Worsley Alumina operations more than doubled to $422 million even as production slipped, making alumina the second-biggest profit driver after manganese. “The key takeaway was softer FY19 cost and capex guidance ... we acknowledge that S32 continues to screen favourably under spot prices,” said RBC in a report. South32’s annual manganese output rose 10 percent while full-year coking coal output fell. Coal, however, beat estimates as production ramped up at Illawarra, where work was stalled at its Appin coal mine last year due to elevated gas levels. The miner said Illawarra continues to recover, with 6.1 million tonnes of production expected in fiscal 2019 and an anticipated return to historical rates of over 8 million tonnes per annum from second-half of fiscal 2020. South32, which was chipped off mining giant BHP Billiton in 2015, resolved to pay a final dividend of 6.2 cents a share. It had paid 6.4 cents per share in 2017. The company, which has nearly doubled in value since it was hived off from BHP, announced in November that it plans to cut interest in its South African coal business and said it completed the purchase of Canada’s Arizona Mining this month. The company expects group production to climb by 5 percent in fiscal 2019. $1 = 1.3669 Australian dollars

2018-08-23,"* World stocks edge lower, European shares edge up * Fresh round of U.S.-China trade tariffs take effect * Trump threatened by legal woes of two former advisers * Dollar snaps losing streak after Fed signal Sept rate hike By Kit Rees LONDON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - World stocks came under pressure on Thursday as new tariffs took effect in the U.S./China trade war and markets speculated about U.S. President Donald Trump’s position following legal rulings against two former advisers. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was 0.1 percent lower by 0822 GMT, while a rise across defensive sectors helped Europe’s STOXX 600 eke out a 0.1 percent gain. Stocks were subdued as the U.S. and China, despite ongoing talks, implemented 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion worth of each other’s goods. The world’s two biggest economic powers have now slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on a combined $100 billion of products since early July, with more in the pipeline, adding to risks to global economic growth. Caroline Simmons, deputy head of the UK chief investment office at UBS Wealth Management, cited such concerns as a reason for paring back an overweight on global equities to a very small position. “We’ve got trade conflicts, and sanctions, in Turkey and Russia, so there are a few things going on that we were a little nervous about,” Simmons said, though her firm still saw upside to equity markets, with good fundamentals. The auto sector, particularly sensitive to tariff developments, was the worst performing in Europe, down 0.7 percent. Earlier, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index stumbled 0.5 percent while Chinese blue-chips gained 0.4 percent. While investors are looking ahead to see how increasing trade barriers between China and the United States might affect corporate earnings, political turmoil also weighed. Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations on Tuesday and former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was found guilty on charges of tax and bank fraud. Investors are considering whether the twin setback will hurt the president and his Republican Party’s prospects in mid-term elections. That weighed on Wall Street overnight and the market ended mixed despite the S&P500 clocking its longest bull run in history. E-Minis for the S&P 500 were also subdued, trading 0.1 percent lower. Cohen’s plea deal does not mean the president has been implicated in anything, press secretary Sarah Sanders said at a White House briefing. “While the (legal issues) shouldn’t substantially alter the stock market landscape, money managers and analysts say the developments raise the likelihood of further turbulence ahead for Mr. Trump heading into the mid-term elections,” said James McGlew, Perth-based analyst at stockbroking firm Argonaut. Political tensions were not limited to the United States. Australian shares slipped 0.3 percent after several senior ministers tendered their resignations on Thursday and demanded a second vote on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership. The Australian dollar fell 0.8 percent for its second straight day of declines. The political uncertainty helped the dollar snap a five-day losing streak, with the greenback in demand after the Federal Reserve suggested that a rate hike for September was on the cards. The dollar index, which measures it against a basket of major currencies, added 0.3 percent to 95.397, pulling off its lowest in three weeks. The euro was off 0.4 percent at $1.1556, not far from Wednesday’s two-week high of $1.1623. The Japanese yen weakened 0.2 percent to 110.78 per dollar. A stronger dollar put pressure on commodities, with Brent crude, the international benchmark, easing to $74.41 while U.S. crude also declined to $67.67. U.S. gold futures for December delivery fell 0.7 percent while spot gold dipped 0.6 percent to $1,188.16 an ounce. Copper fell 1.5 percent.

2018-08-23,"* Underlying profit doubles to $217 mln, beats RBC forecast * On track to cut net debt to below $2 bln this year * Santos shares jump 12 pct to 4-1/2 year high * Analysts say Quadrant acquisition price looks good (Adds comment from CEO, investor, analyst) By Sonali Paul MELBOURNE, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Santos Ltd, Australia’s No.2 independent gas producer, on Thursday reported a near doubling in half-year profit and revived its dividend, just a day after locking in near-term growth with an over $2 billion acquisition. Investors said the results and deal to buy Quadrant Energy in the state of Western Australia vindicated the firm’s decision earlier this year to reject a $10.8 billion takeover bid from private equity-backed Harbour Energy. Santos shares jumped as much as 12 percent to a 4-1/2 year high of A$7.00 on Thursday, the same price Harbour had offered for the firm and a level investors had not expected to be reached again so soon after that bid fell through. “After rejecting Harbour Energy’s bid earlier this year, Santos’s management has had a point to prove to its shareholders – that the company had emerged from survival mode and is ready to grow again. This deal certainly does that,” said Wood Mackenzie analyst Daniel Toleman. JPMorgan likened the acquisition to pulling a “rabbit out of a hat”, while several analysts pointed to strong growth prospects with Quadrant’s Dorado oil find off Western Australia. “The synergies they can get out of full ownership of Quadrant, debt funding the whole thing, it’s a pretty accretive deal for them. I didn’t expect it to happen,” said Andy Forster, a portfolio manager at Argo Investments, Santos’s ninth-largest shareholder. The company reported that underlying profit for the half-year ended June 30 rose to $217 million from $109 million a year earlier, beating a Royal Bank of Canada forecast of $189 million. That came even as first-half output was hit by an outage at the Papua New Guinea LNG (liquefied natural gas) plant after an earthquake. Santos declared an interim dividend of $0.035 a share. It suspended dividends in 2016, diverting cash to pay down debt which had peaked for the construction of its Gladstone LNG project just as oil prices collapsed. It has since cut net debt to $2.4 billion and said it was on course to get it below $2 billion before the end of this year, a year ahead of plan, thanks to sharp cost-cutting and a rebound in oil and gas prices. “We’re fully funded to execute our growth programme and to be able to pay a sustainable dividend going forward,” Santos Chief Executive Kevin Gallagher told Reuters in an interview. The Quadrant acquisition, which Gallagher said the company had been looking at for around a year, is expected to boost the company’s free cash flow by around 17 percent in 2019, assuming oil prices of $65 a barrel. Santos said the cash generated from Quadrant, the biggest gas supplier to the domestic market in Western Australia, will help fund expansions in northern Australia and Papua New Guinea, as well as servicing the $1.2 billion in debt it is taking on for the deal. “What it does do is it gives us more choice. Now we have really good growth opportunities in all of our core assets,” Gallagher said. The company’s weak spot, the Gladstone LNG project, aims to reach output of 6 million tonnes a year by the end of 2019, four years after opening. Gallagher gave no estimate on when the project would hit its capacity of 7.8 million tonnes. Santos still expects 2018 production of 55-58 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) on growing output from its Cooper Basin assets, and maintained its sales volume guidance of 72-76 mmboe.

2018-08-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - Premier Oil is set to raise stable peak production at its Catcher field in Britain’s North Sea by as much as 17 percent to 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day this year, after output reached that level this summer, it said on Thursday. The news came as Premier (PMO.L) reported first-half profit after tax more than doubled to $98.4 million, helped by higher oil prices. First output at the Catcher field marked a milestone for the company last December, leading it to forecast a 10 percent output hike for 2018, with the field’s sustainable peak production - or plateau production - pencilled in at 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). This summer, the field - of which Premier owns half alongside  Cairn (CNE.L), MOL MOLB.BU and Dyas - has reached 70,000 boe/d, of which around 65,000 is oil and the rest gas. “There is significant scope to increase the plateau rate towards that level,” Chief Executive Tony Durrant said.     Premier reiterated it expected group output to reach 80,000-85,000 boe/day this year. (GRAPHIC: Premier Oil Production - reut.rs/2P0kQ06) Core profit, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), rose around a fifth to $388.9 million in the first half, the British energy company said.  Its shares rose as much as 3.6 percent to a two-week high of 125.9 pence in early trading. “At current oil prices (EBITDA) is expected to increase significantly in the second half of this year,” it said. Premier kept its target to reduce its debt pile of around $2.65 billion by $300 million-$400 million by the end of 2018. Looking for growth, Premier on Monday approved its Tolmount gas project in the British North Sea, which is expected to produce around 500 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas from late 2020. Construction for the Tolmount platform is due to start in December, Premier said. Premier’s other two big growth projects are progressing as drilling in Mexico’s closely-watched Zama basin is due to begin early in the fourth quarter. As for its Sea Lion project off the Falkland Islands’ coast in the south Atlantic, Premier has lined up initial agreements on contracts and expects funding to be in place by the end of 2018 and government approvals from mid-2019, Durrant said.

China will promote the use of ethanol in 15 regions this year, including the Beijing and Tianjin municipalities and Hebei province, according to a post on the government’s official website that summarised a Wednesday meeting of the nation’s State Council. The most-active corn futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange settled at 1,889 yuan ($274.80), up 0.7 percent from a day earlier. Prices earlier rose as much as 1.3 percent to an intraday high of 1,900 yuan. The gains also followed customs data released on Thursday showing a big drop in corn imports in July after Beijing imposed hefty tariffs on shipments from the United States as part of its trade conflict. “Capital piled into corn futures betting on increasing demand. The comments are bullish news for ethanol and corn, even if they are still a bit vague,” said Meng Jinhui, analyst with Shengda Futures. Beijing will lay out plans for grain-based ethanol production and accelerate the construction of cassava-based ethanol plants, the government posting said. No further details were given. The statement comes after the government announced in September a plan to blend ethanol into fuel nationwide by 2020 to digest the nation’s vast corn stockpiles. The statement has allayed concerns in the industry that the ethanol policy had stalled, and shares in China’s ethanol producers rallied as the news restored confidence among investors. State-controlled producers, like China’s State Development & Investment Corp (SDIC), agribusiness COFCO and Jilin Fuel, have rushed to draw up plans to invest billions of yuan to double output in the world’s largest car market. But only one major project has received a greenlight to start construction on an ethanol plant. $1 = 6.8740 Chinese yuan

2018-08-23,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Biofuel producer and oil refiner Neste (NESTE.HE) sees good opportunities for its renewable jet fuel despite a cancelled pilot project in Switzerland, a company executive said. The Finnish company is hoping to get a boost for its biofuels business in the coming years from proposed reductions of CO2 emissions in aviation. The pilot project was due to replace at least 1 percent of jet fuel used at Geneva airport with Neste’s biofuel, until Swiss authorities earlier this week told Neste they had decided not to back the scheme. Neste had considered the Geneva project as an important step in ramping up its aviation business, but the head of its renewable products Kaisa Hietala told Reuters the cancellation would not affect Neste’s plans. “It was surprising, a disappointment ... but we have other partners to proceed with, and there are more coming in the pipeline,” she said. Neste has recently announced similar projects with Dallas airport in the United States as well as American Airlines (AAL.O), and the product has already been tested by Boeing (BA.N) and Lufthansa (LHAG.DE). “At the moment, what holds back this market is high price and availability. But when the market is created, there will be more interest,” Hietala said. She added Neste’s plan to expand its biofuel production in Singapore would enable it to provide sufficient volumes for the aviation market. Production at the new line is due to begin in 2022. The International Civil Aviation Organization is targeting carbon-neutral growth in aviation from 2020, Hietala noted.  “Aviation is a global business that grows at a fast pace. Reliability of delivery for the fuel will be an important question.” Alongside Neste, at least one other company, U.S. AltAir Fuels, has tested biofuel for aircraft with pilot projects. Neste has stepped up usage of low-quality feedstock in its biofuels: waste and residue inputs, such as animal fats, make up more than 80 percent of its raw materials. In the first half of 2018, biofuels for road traffic made 70 percent of Neste’s core profit of 679 million euros (603.39 million pounds). “Aviation might become a significant source of income for us in the future,” Hietala said.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.3 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index stumbled 0.6 percent while Chinese shares see-sawed between positive and negative territory. The blue-chip index was last up 0.4 percent. Spreadbetters pointed to a subdued start for European shares with FTSE futures off 0.2 percent. E-Minis for the S&P500 were a shade softer too. While investors are looking ahead to see how increasing trade barriers between China and the United States might affect corporate earnings, political turmoil remained a focus for financial markets on Thursday. A major overhang remains the fallout from criminal probes against Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen and ex-campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Investors are considering whether the setback would hurt the Republican Party’s election prospects. The investigations weighed on Wall Street overnight which ended mixed despite the S&P500 clocking its longest bull run in history. Trump was not charged and Cohen’s plea deal does not mean the president has been implicated in anything, press secretary Sarah Sanders said at a White House briefing. “While the (legal issues) shouldn’t substantially alter the stock market landscape, money managers and analysts say the developments raise the likelihood of further turbulence ahead for Mr. Trump heading into the mid-term elections,” said James McGlew, Perth-based analyst at stockbroking firm Argonaut. “And that uncertainty would likely weigh on the minds of investors.” The political tensions were not limited to the United States though. Australian shares slipped 0.3 percent, falling victim to political uncertainties surrounding Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull after several senior ministers tendered their resignations on Thursday and demanded a second leadership vote. The turmoil also hit the Australian dollar, which became the worst performing major currency on Thursday. It was last down 0.8 percent for its second straight day of decline. Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei added 0.2 percent while Indian shares lost their puff after climbing to a record-high. Another focus for investors will be manufacturing data from Europe and the United States later in the day as investors gauge whether the spectre of a global trade war is hurting economic activity. A survey on Thursday showed Japanese manufacturing activity grew at a slightly faster pace in August although export orders contracted, adding to worries about rising trade protectionism. The United States and China implemented 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion worth of each other’s goods on Thursday. The latest round brings to $50 billion the value of imports subjected to tariffs on either side since early July, and more are in the pipeline, adding to risks for global economic growth. In its research titled “Storm Squalls”, Citi said that divergence in the various trade disputes between the United States and its trading partners is likely to be a key driver for markets. “Trade tensions have narrowed to U.S. vs China; however, there is no such thing as a bilateral trade war,” it added. “Despite recent signs that trade talks are resuming, we expect U.S.-China trade tensions to continue.” The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, added 0.3 percent to 95.415 after six straight sessions of losses took it to the lowest in three weeks. The euro was last off 0.3 percent at $1.1553, not far from Wednesday’s two-week high of $1.1623 touched on Wednesday. The Japanese yen weakened 0.3 percent to 110.85 per dollar.

2018-08-23,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil and copper prices edged lower on Thursday as the U.S.-China trade dispute escalated while global equity markets fell as gains in U.S. technology shares failed to offset declines in commodity-related and trade-sensitive stocks. The United States and China implemented punitive 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion worth of each other’s goods, even as mid-level officials from both sides resumed talks in Washington. The dollar rose after minutes released on Wednesday from the Federal Reserve’s most recent meeting suggested the U.S. central bank is on course for further interest rate hikes. The minutes showed policy-makers discussed how global trade disputes could batter businesses and households. A prolonged trade war could change expectations for monetary tightening. U.S. trade tensions with China are more likely to deteriorate this year and will dampen global growth next year, Moody’s Investors Service said in an economic outlook report. A drop in crude prices pushed oil heavyweights lower, with Exxon Mobil leading declining shares in U.S. markets and on MSCI’s gauge of global equity markets, which shed 0.42 percent. Oil prices were choppy as the U.S.-Sino trade dispute weighed on the market, but crude drew some support from a report on Wednesday showing a decline in U.S. commercial crude inventories. Brent settled down 5 cents at $74.73 while U.S. crude slid 3 cents to settle down at $67.83 per barrel. “Fears are rife that economic headwinds stemming from an escalation in their trade war will ultimately hurt global oil demand,” said Stephen Brennock, analyst at brokerage PVM Oil Associates. The dispute has yet to crimp economic growth. Data from the U.S. Labor Department showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week. They are now so low economists have scrambled for explanations. In London metals markets, benchmark copper fell 0.67 percent to $5,965.00 a tonne, paring losses of more than 1 percent earlier in the session. China accounts for nearly half of global copper consumption and prices are near their highest in two years as manufacturers have rushed to buy refined metal to avoid import tariffs. In Europe, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed down 0.19 percent, pulled lower by a 1.55 percent fall in trade-sensitive auto stocks. Sixteen companies in the 18-share index fell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 76.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 25,656.98. The S&P 500 lost 4.84 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,856.98 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 10.64 points, or 0.13 percent, to 7,878.46. The trade-sensitive S&P industrials sector dipped .037 percent, while the technology index rose 0.18 percent, the only S&P sector to rise as Microsoft, Nvidia and Apple led gains.  U.S. Treasuries were little changed ahead of a speech by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday at the Federal Reserve’s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. “Everybody’s on wait-and-see mode for Jackson Hole tomorrow,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale in New York.  Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 1/32 in price to yield 2.8207 percent. Signs of faster economic growth and inflation in the euro zone lifted German 10-year bund yields to 0.34 percent, up from recent lows of 0.29 percent earlier this week. The dollar snapped a five-day losing streak. The dollar index rose 0.51 percent while the euro fell 0.49 percent to $1.1539.

2018-08-23,"MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canada ought to require stronger tank cars for transporting flammable liquids sooner than the current deadline in 2025, Transportation Safety Board Chair Kathy Fox said on Thursday, noting that crude-by-rail shipments are expected to rise in the country.  “We understand that it can’t happen all at once. But we’d like to see it sooner,” Fox said in an interview, without giving a specific alternative date. “We do have an ongoing concern that flammable liquids be transported in the most robust tank cars.” Canada and the United States have introduced new requirements to more safely transport flammable liquids, after a 2013 runaway train explosion carrying crude killed 47 in the Canadian province of Quebec. Older DOT-111 cars, used during the tragedy in Lac Megantic, Quebec, have already been replaced in Canada by CPC-1232 cars for moving crude oil, but even these must be completely phased out by May 1, 2025 for the transport of flammable liquids, according to the TSB. They will need to be replaced by TC-117 cars, or retrofits that meet the same standard, which has thicker steel.  The U.S. Department of Transportation expects flammable liquids to be carried in comparable DOT-117 rail tank cars, or retrofits, by May 1, 2029. Canada has not experienced a major derailment of a crude train since 2015, Fox said. But in the United States, a BNSF Railway Co [BNISF.UL] freight train carrying crude oil derailed in northwest Iowa in June, sending some 230,000 gallons of oil into a state waterway. Crude-by-rail transports, which have declined in Canada in recent years on declining oil prices, are showing signs of a resurgence. Canada exported a record 204,558 barrels per day of crude by rail in June, the National Energy Board said on Wednesday, as oil shippers coped with congested pipelines. That volume jumped 86 percent from a year earlier, but expanding oil producers have said they need to move much more to reduce a steep discount on their heavy crude prices. Recommendations following Lac Megantic have led to improved oversight and standards for tank cars, Fox said. But she remains concerned over a recent rise in uncontrolled train movements that could be prevented with better training, less reliance on air or hand brakes and improved physical defences.  “We’re encouraged to see the progress made since Lac Megantic,” she said. “But there is still more work to be done.” Additional reporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg; Editing by David Gregorio",https://uk.reuters.com/article/canada-tsb-chair/canada-should-bring-in-stronger-rail-cars-for-crude-before-2025-official-idUKL2N1VD1XY,23 Aug 2018,"Canada ought to require

2018-08-23,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Thursday as the escalating trade war between the United States and China weighed on demand expectations a day after prices jumped on a big draw in U.S. crude inventories. Brent crude oil LCOc1 settled down 5 cents at $74.73 a barrel. U.S. light crude CLc1 was 3 cents lower at $67.83 a barrel. Options activity showed some traders were guarding against the possibility of a sharp slide in U.S. crude prices. “The market is trying to balance the worries about decreased global demand growth and how much extra oil the Saudis and Russians are going to put on,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.  Still, he said, prices drew support from the bigger-than-expected draw in U.S. crude inventories reported on Wednesday by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). [EIA/S] “There’s a better fundamental picture than a year ago,” he said. The U.S.-China trade dispute deepened, with the imposition of 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion worth of each other’s goods. The world’s two largest economies have imposed tariffs on a combined $100 billion of products since early July, and Washington is holding hearings on proposed duties on another $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. China is almost certain to respond. The trade war is “expected to shave up to 0.3-0.5 percentage points from China’s real GDP growth in 2019,” said Moody’s Investor Service, adding it should cut 0.25 percentage point from projected U.S. real GDP growth “to 2.3 percent in 2019.” The dispute has already led analysts to trim forecasts for energy consumption, though some markets remain tight. U.S. commercial crude oil inventories C-STK-T-EIA fell 5.8 million barrels last week, the EIA said on Wednesday, more than three times forecasts. “This week’s report was bullish for crude,” said Societe Generale oil analyst Michael Wittner. “Crude stocks drew due to sharply lower crude imports and near-record refinery crude runs.” The EIA also said U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA was rising, reaching 11 million barrels per day last week. That means the world’s three top producers - Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia - now all pump around 11 million bpd, meeting a third of global demand. In options activity, December 2018 puts for oil at $50 a barrel traded, though the volume was thin with just a few hundred contracts exchanged, said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho in New York.  “The fact that someone even thought it was possible to get there is interesting,” Yawger said. “To get to $50 it would need to get ugly between now and then.” Volume on the options at $50 a barrel remained much lower than options in a range closer to the current level.

2018-08-23,"JENGRE, Nigeria, Aug 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - For Rhoda Tanko, preparing dishes of okra or egusi soup in her small shack was a daily ordeal spent battling the dizzying, toxic black fumes spewed out by her charcoal stove. “Every time I had to cook for my family, I knew I had to deal with smoke that made my head feel heavy and my eyes swim,” Tanko, a 38-year-old mother of four, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in the central Nigerian town of Jengre. Her home’s energy needs were costly too: oil-rich Nigeria’s unreliable power supply meant she had little choice but to spend a large part of the family’s income on firewood, charcoal and kerosene. But that changed earlier this year when, with help from her local cooperative, Tanko bought a new, cleaner-burning stove. The stove, which cost 10,500 naira ($34), was provided by Solar Sister, a non-profit that operates in Nigeria as well as in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. The charity helps women entrepreneurs sell clean-energy consumer products such as solar lamps and a stove that minimises emissions by trapping most of the smoke fumes within its aluminium combustion chamber. A more efficient stove means fewer trees are felled for firewood, said Hanatu Onogu, Solar Sister’s business development manager in northern Nigeria. “Because people use less charcoal and firewood for more cooking, it saves resources. In the long run, it reduces the rate of deforestation and conserves energy,” Onogu said. Over the past two years, about 4,500 of these stoves have been sold in     Nigeria alone, according to Solar Sister. Tanko, who is one of several hundred women in her area testing out the stove, said it had made a big difference. “It cooks food faster and it doesn’t consume much charcoal. Before, a bag of charcoal would not last one month, but now it’s been four months and this bag is not finished yet,” she said, pointing at a half-empty sack. Worldwide, more than three billion people use traditional, solid fuels like charcoal, firewood and dung to cook, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). And each year nearly four million people, most of them women and girls, die from the effects of these dirty, climate-changing cooking fuels, the WHO says, in part due to inefficient stoves and poorly ventilated homes. A lack of access to cleaner energy supplies is a problem in Nigeria too - despite the fact that the country of 180 million people is Africa’s biggest oil producer. Fuel shortages are common, with its 445,000 barrel-per-day refining system operating well below capacity due to mismanagement and lack of investment, forcing the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to import most of its gasoline. The country has set a target of expanding electricity access to 75 percent of the population by 2020 and 90 percent by 2030. Meantime, the supply remains unreliable: January saw six power outages in eight days as the national grid repeatedly collapsed, plunging most of the country into darkness. That burden falls harder on Nigerians in rural areas, where just one in four people are connected to the national grid, according to campaign group Power for All, which promotes decentralized, renewable energy, and which funds Solar Sister. Moving from fossil fuels to cleaner energy for cooking - and solar energy for lighting - has gained momentum in parts of northern Nigeria through groups like Solar Sister. The non-profit assists low-income families like Tanko’s to switch by offering the option to pay in instalments. It also provides customer support and raises awareness about the benefits of clean energy. A lack of access to a reliable supply of electricity means many families in Nigeria - and across Africa - use kerosene for lighting, a fuel that experts say is polluting, dirty and bad for human health. It is also relatively expensive: switching to solar could cut the amount that families in Africa spend on lighting to just 2 percent of their household income - down from 9 percent - according to a 2016 report by the Overseas Development Institute, a think-tank based in the United Kingdom. Using a solar-powered lamp means 28-year-old Nafisa Abubakar can avoid the dangers of kerosene and the inconvenience of blackouts. Sitting in her small shack, she flicked a switch, and a solar lamp lit up her home. Abubakar could not have done that with confidence six years ago, even though her home was connected to the national utility, known then as NEPA. “Our light was very inconsistent. Sometimes for two months straight the light would not even turn on,” Abubakar said in Hausa via a translator. “We were using NEPA light. Then one day the transformer blew up and it was not repaired until a year later. So we have been using the (Solar Sister) lamp for five years now,” she said. As day turned to night, Abubakar and her husband watched television while their two sons finished their homework under the radiant light of the solar lamp. “We are happy for this light that we have,” she said. Solar Sister says nearly 48,000 solar products have been sold in Nigeria since 2015 - be they phone-charging units, household lights or lamps. And for Abubakar, the lamp has become more than a household convenience: these days she sells solar lights for a living. Power for All, the campaign group, said the products allowed people to live safer, healthier lives and to save money. ""We are even happier for the women who use them and have built sustainable micro-enterprises selling them, as it has brightened the chances of ending energy poverty,"" said the group's Nigeria spokesman Mark Amaza.

2018-08-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - The market for freight fuels is moving close to balance, after tightening significantly in 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, contributing to the recent stabilisation in crude oil prices. OECD stocks of middle distillate fuels, including road diesel, marine gasoil and jet fuel, totalled 513 million barrels at the end of June, according to the International Energy Agency (“Oil Market Report”, August 2018). Stocks have fallen compared with the slump years of 2015-2017 (when they ranged from 554 million to 611 million barrels) but are higher than in the pre-slump years of 2012-2014 (496-505 million barrels). Fuel availability appears to have improved since the middle of the second quarter, with U.S. distillate stocks rising to almost 131 million barrels last week, up from just 115 million in mid-May. U.S. stocks are now 18 million barrels below the ten-year seasonal average, compared with a deficit of 23 million in May, and the gap is closing. Confirming that stocks are still tight, but only marginally so, the calendar spread for European gasoil futures is close to level. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2MsjcaJ) The one-year spread has been trading in an average backwardation of roughly $2.50 per tonne (just 32 cents per barrel) over the last 30 days. The spread is currently in the 55th percentile for the distribution since 1994, implying traders see gasoil availability close to average levels. Slower growth in global trade since the start of the year, and especially since the second quarter, is likely to be contributing to improved availability of distillates by moderating the increase in fuel consumption. On the production side, refining margins for making gasoil remain healthy, averaging just over $15 per barrel in the last month, putting them in the 67th percentile since 2008. Margins have widened since mid-July, but mostly because crude prices have weakened rather than gasoil prices have risen, reflecting weakness in the crude market rather than strength in fuels. Soft crude prices coupled with firm gasoil margins are giving refineries a strong incentive to maximise production of distillates. U.S. refiners produced more than 5.4 million barrels per day of distillate fuel last week, a seasonal record, and more than 600,000 bpd above the ten-year average. If refinery runs remain strong throughout the remainder of August and September, which seems likely in the absence of a hurricane strike on the Texas-Louisiana coast, distillate availability should improve significantly. In a sign that distillates are becoming more plentiful, hedge fund managers have cut their net bullish position in European gasoil by 50 million barrels since late May and in U.S. heating oil by 30 million barrels. The distillate market seems to have re-found its balance and availability should remain high unless global trade accelerates again or the northern hemisphere winter is unusually long and cold.

2018-08-23,"LONDON, Aug 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Leaders of some of the world’s biggest cities vowed on Thursday to make all buildings carbon neutral by 2050, ensuring they make no contribution to climate change. From London to Tokyo, 19 mayors said they would put in place regulations requiring all new buildings to be carbon neutral by 2030 and all existing ones to reach the same goal by 2050. “Climate change poses an existential threat to New York City, and making our buildings more sustainable and efficient is a key part of the solution,” said Mayor of New York Bill de Blasio in a statement. Houses, offices and other buildings account for more than half of all planet-warming gasses emitted by urban areas, according to C40 Cities, a network of cities pushing climate action that shepherded the latest commitment. In London, Los Angeles and Paris, the share is as high as 70 percent of all greenhouse emissions, it said. “Paris is home to some of the world’s most beautiful and iconic buildings ...  we recognise our responsibility to ensure every building, whether historic or brand new, helps deliver a sustainable future,” said Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo. Experts said the target was feasible, but that more cities would have to follow suit if the world was to achieve the Paris climate goals. The 2015 Paris Agreement set a goal of limiting a rise in average world surface temperatures to “well below” 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times, while “pursuing efforts” to limit rising temperatures to 1.5C (2.7F). “The biggest challenge is ensuring that developers avoid cutting corners to save relatively small amounts in construction today, by passing retrofit costs onto future owners,” said Eric Lounsbury, director of environmental consultancy Carbon Trust. “To achieve the ambitions of the Paris Agreement we will need all buildings to be net zero emissions by the middle of this century,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Buildings that are net carbon neutral are powered by renewable sources and consume little energy, typically using LED lights, winter insulation and roof-top solar panels. “Buildings are a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, so to meet reductions set out in the Paris Agreement, it’s critical that we tackle this problem,” said Helen Clarkson, head of The Climate Group, a charity promoting climate action. The pledge was signed by London, Copenhagen, Johannesburg, Los Angeles, Montreal, New York City, Newburyport, Paris, Portland, San Francisco, San Jose, Santa Monica, Stockholm, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto, Tshwane, Vancouver and Washington DC.

2018-08-23,"* Johan Sverdrup set to start production in late 2019 * At peak could make up 25 pct of total Norway petroleum output * No other giant oilfield found off Norway since Sverdrup By Nerijus Adomaitis JOHAN SVERDRUP PLATFORM, North Sea, Aug 23 (Reuters) - N orway’s Equinor sees scope to further reduce development costs at the Johan Sverdrup oilfield in the North Sea, as it looks to maximise the potential of what could be the last giant field to be found off the Nordic country. The field, one of the five largest oil finds offshore Norway, is estimated to contain up to 3.1 billion barrels of oil equivalents, mainly crude oil, enough to meet Britain’s oil demand for five years. Sverdrup is on track to begin production in late 2019 and could produce up to a quarter of Norway’s overall petroleum output at its peak. Equinor, formerly Statoil, has already cut development costs by 35 billion crowns ($4.1 billion) to 88 billion crowns, thanks to more efficient drilling and smooth execution that meant cash put aside for contingencies has not been used. “I think there are still some further gains on the cost side,” Margareth Oevrum, Equinor’s executive president for technology, project and drilling, told Reuters. Oevrum was speaking at the Sverdrup drilling platform, one of two already in place in the North Sea, some 160 km (100 miles) west of the Norwegian coast. Workers were connecting pipes, laying cables and testing equipment in heavy wind and rain, part of the 800 staff currently offshore to complete construction. The remaining two platforms are expected to be delivered to the field in spring 2019. During the first stage of development, Sverdrup is expected to produce up to 440,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day (boepd), while the second phase, scheduled to start in 2022, is expected to boost output to 660,000 boepd. State-controlled Equinor is expected to submit a plan for the field’s second phase, estimated to cost a preliminary 45 billion crowns, later this month. “Going forward this will be the biggest oilfield producing on the Norwegian continental shelf,” said Oevrum. Sverdrup’s significance in terms of oil output could be even higher. Oil pricing agency S&P Global Platts has said output from the field would be suitable for its North Sea basket, making it potentially a sixth crude underpinning the Brent benchmark , used to price most global oil. The field also helped sustain demand for industry suppliers during the 2015 oil downturn, with Equinor and partners Lundin Petroleum, Aker BP, Petoro and Total awarding contracts worth over 60 billion crowns. “I lost my job when the (oil) crisis came, and I got it back, when this project started, so I am very happy,” said Stian Simonsen, 30, a pipe fitter working at Sverdrup. The field is named after a 19th century Norwegian prime minister. But there may not be another Sverdrup to help the Norwegian oil industry in the years ahead. “I can’t see anything larger for the future ... We have Johan Castberg, but it’s not as big as Johan Sverdrup,” Oevrum said, referring to Equinor’s oilfield development in the Arctic. “We are still positive about exploration and will explore more, but at the moment we don’t have anything.” Oevrum herself will soon leave Norway for Brazil to supervise the development of the Equinor-operated Carcara discovery, which is of a similar size to Sverdrup. While Norway still accounts for about two-thirds of Equinor’s total petroleum output, its international operations have been hitting new quarterly records. “The Norwegian continental shelf has been the backbone of Equinor for many years, and it will continue for some time, but it will be gradually replaced by the international production,” Oevrum said. $1 = 8.4525 Norwegian crowns

2018-08-23,"MELBOURNE, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The risk of blackouts in Australia’s upcoming summer has grown from last year as ageing coal-fired power plants have become less reliable, the nation’s energy market operator said on Friday, calling for more power investment in the next few years. The Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) latest outlook underscores worries about the country’s grid just days after the government’s signature energy policy to boost power reliability, lower emissions and cut prices collapsed amid political turmoil. “Close collaboration with industry in the lead up and throughout summer will be key to reducing the risks of energy supply shortfalls,” AEMO Managing Director Audrey Zibelman said in a statement. Australia’s southeastern states suffered a string of blackouts in 2016 and 2017, the worst of which hit the entire state of South Australia and shut global miner BHP’s Olympic Dam copper mine for two weeks, costing it $105 million. AEMO sees the states of Victoria and South Australia most at risk of outages in the 2018-19 summer, which runs from December through February, with some risk in the most populous state, New South Wales, where a severe drought could deplete hydropower. Electricity demand typically jumps over the summer as households and businesses crank up air conditioning. The Bureau of Meteorology has not issued its forecast for this summer yet, but has said that temperatures this spring are likely to be warmer than average. “The forecast risk of load-shedding in 2018-19 has increased since the 2017 (outlook), primarily because modelling has now factored in a reduction in thermal generation reliability observed in recent years,” AEMO said. Unexpected outages at coal-fired plants have forced Australia’s biggest power user, the Tomago aluminium smelter, partly owned by Rio Tinto, to cut output several times this year, as it looked to avoid sharp price spikes when Sydney was on the verge of blackouts. “(Without shoring up reserves), there would be a risk of involuntary load-shedding during summer peak periods in Victoria from this summer, in New South Wales from 2023-24 and in South Australia from 2024-25,” AEMO said. AEMO is repeating steps from last summer when it lined up back-up supply and paid big energy users to cut energy use at times when the system was short on supply. As Australia’s ageing coal-fired generators, which supply more than 70 percent of the market’s electricity, get closer to retiring starting in 2022, the market will need to find new sources beyond those already planned to avert outages. “The results emphasise the need for an investment landscape which supports the development of the portfolio of resources required to replace retiring generation,” AEMO said.

2018-08-23,"KIEV, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Ukraine, which wants to resume cooperation with the International Monetary Fund, may need to increase household gas prices, Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman was quoted as saying on Thursday. Earlier this month the government extended a freeze on gas prices until at least Sept. 1, reducing its prospects of securing more money from the IMF which is needed to keep its war-battered economy on a stable footing. “You know that there are obligations that (our) gas prices will rise in conditions of rising global gas prices. I have been restraining this situation for a year. However, now there is a question of another increase,” Interfax Ukraine news agency quoted Groysman as saying during his trip to western Ukraine. “This requirement arose because we need to work with external borrowings”, he added. Ukraine must raise gas prices to market levels in order to qualify for more aid under a $17.5 billion IMF program. It initially agreed to raise prices under a jointly agreed formula but has since postponed the increases a number of times. Ukraine hasn’t received any money from the IMF since April 2017 due to a slowdown in the pace of reforms. That has put the country in a more financially precarious situation as it must repay around $15 billion of foreign currency debt in the next two years. The government may shy away from potentially unpopular measures like gas price hikes with presidential and parliamentary elections due next year but said talks with the IMF were continuing.

2018-08-23,"(Adds detail, updates prices) * World stocks edge lower, European shares edge up * Fresh round of U.S.-China trade tariffs take effect * Trump threatened by legal woes of two former advisers * Dollar snaps losing streak after Fed signal Sept rate hike By Kit Rees LONDON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - World stocks came under pressure on Thursday as new tariffs took effect in the U.S./China trade war and markets speculated about U.S. President Donald Trump’s position following legal rulings against two former advisers. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was 0.1 percent lower by 1116 GMT, while a rise across tech and energy stocks helped Europe’s STOXX 600 eke out a 0.1 percent gain. Stocks were subdued as the U.S. and China, despite ongoing talks, implemented 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion worth of each other’s goods. The world’s two biggest economic powers have now slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on a combined $100 billion of products since early July, with more in the pipeline, adding to risks to global economic growth. Caroline Simmons, deputy head of the UK chief investment office at UBS Wealth Management, cited such concerns as a reason for paring back an overweight on global equities to a very small position. “We’ve got trade conflicts, and sanctions, in Turkey and Russia, so there are a few things going on that we were a little nervous about,” Simmons said, though her firm still saw upside to equity markets, with good fundamentals. The auto sector, particularly sensitive to tariff developments, was the worst performing in Europe, down 0.9 percent. Earlier, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index stumbled 0.5 percent while Chinese blue-chips gained 0.4 percent. While investors are looking ahead to see how increasing trade barriers between China and the United States might affect corporate earnings, political turmoil also weighed. Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations on Tuesday and former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was found guilty on charges of tax and bank fraud. Investors are considering whether the twin setback will hurt the president and his Republican Party’s prospects in mid-term elections. That weighed on Wall Street overnight and the market ended mixed despite the S&P500 clocking its longest bull run in history. E-Minis for the S&P 500 were also subdued on Thursday, trading flat. Cohen’s plea deal does not mean the president has been implicated in anything, press secretary Sarah Sanders said at a White House briefing. “While the (legal issues) shouldn’t substantially alter the stock market landscape, money managers and analysts say the developments raise the likelihood of further turbulence ahead for Mr. Trump heading into the mid-term elections,” said James McGlew, Perth-based analyst at stockbroking firm Argonaut. Political tensions were not limited to the United States. Australian shares slipped 0.3 percent after several senior ministers tendered their resignations on Thursday and demanded a second vote on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership. The Australian dollar fell 0.8 percent for its second straight day of declines. The political uncertainty helped the dollar snap a five-day losing streak, with the greenback in demand after the Federal Reserve suggested that a rate hike for September was on the cards. The dollar index, which measures it against a basket of major currencies, gave up some earlier gains but still added 0.1 percent to 95.238, pulling off its lowest in three weeks. The euro was off 0.1 percent at $1.1580, not far from Wednesday’s two-week high of $1.1623. The Japanese yen weakened 0.2 percent to 110.77 per dollar. A stronger dollar put pressure on commodities. U.S. gold futures for December delivery fell 0.5 percent while spot gold dipped 0.4 percent to $1,190.49 an ounce. Copper slid 0.9 percent. Oil prices clawed back earlier losses. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded flat at $74.79 while U.S. crude rose to $67.97.

2018-08-23,"VAXJO, Sweden (Reuters) - Ringed by forests in southern Sweden, the city of Vaxjo is thriving even as it cuts greenhouse gas emissions at rates more typical of economic crashes in recessions or wars. It is a radical example of tackling climate change by cutting the use of fossil fuels, offering a glimpse of how the world could stay within warming limits which U.N. scientists say are needed to avoid significant environmental damage. Vaxjo’s power plant runs on biomass from timber. In winter, snow plows clear bicycle paths before roads to discourage cars, and political parties all back a target of making the city fossil-fuel free by 2030 to eliminate carbon dioxide emissions from oil, natural gas and coal. Around the world, governments are struggling to meet their various pledges to cut emissions under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, amid unease about heat waves, droughts, and wildfires that have raged this summer from Greece to California. Leading climate scientists are set to warn governments in October that global carbon emissions from energy use will have to plunge by up to seven percent a year to meet Paris’ toughest goals - unless they develop technologies to suck carbon from the air, according to a draft U.N. report obtained by Reuters. Extreme falls are usually known only from World Wars, the 1930s Great Depression or in Russia, where emissions plunged 16 percent in the year after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. Coal-dependent emerging economies led by China and India are all raising energy use to end poverty and developed countries are wary of sacrificing growth for the environment. What works in a city in a rich, stable Nordic democracy is not an easy blueprint. Still, isolated examples like Vaxjo, a city of 66,000 inhabitants where the twin-spired red medieval cathedral contrasts with ultra-modern wooden buildings, are intriguing for policymakers since it has cut emissions and continued to grow. Bo Frank, president of the city council and an architect of the green shift, said his advice boiled down to: “Heavy, heavy tax increase on fossil energy and reduce the tax on all kinds of renewable energy.” Per capita, Vaxjo says carbon dioxide emissions have fallen by 58 percent from 1993-2016, to 1.9 tonnes from 4.5, while local gross domestic product (GDP) rose 32 percent from 1993-2014, according to the latest available figures. The trajectory is uneven, but equates to an annual rate of emissions cuts of 3.7 percent with 1.33 percent growth. By contrast, worldwide carbon emissions rose by two percent last year to a record high of almost five tonnes per capita, according to scientists who compile a Global Carbon Budget..  Vaxjo aims to eliminate carbon emissions from fossil fuels by 2030 - in homes, industry and transport including planes taking off from the local airport. It says its accounting follows U.N. guidelines, treating the municipality as if it were a mini-country. The city estimates that carbon dioxide from fossil fuels accounts for 65 percent of the municipality’s greenhouse gases. Vaxjo has cut other gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, by 42 percent since 1993 but has not yet set deadlines for phasing them out. Thanks to the early green start, Vaxjo’s carbon cuts are far ahead of the timetable set by almost 200 nations in the Paris climate agreement to phase out net emissions of all greenhouse gases sometime from 2050-2100. Sweden as a whole has also cut emissions while sustaining strong economic growth. The country of 10 million tops international environmental rankings and imposes the world’s highest carbon tax, of up to 137 euros ($158.84) a tonne. “The notion that a carbon tax is harmful for the economy in any country is a political notion. Not a factual notion,” said Swedish Environment Minister Karolina Skog, of the Green Party.    The burning of biomass also emits carbon dioxide but can be made carbon neutral by planting new forests, as in Vaxjo, which absorb the gas to grow.  Almost no countries have forests covering two-thirds of the country like Sweden, but Skog noted that all nations have some form of renewable energy, such as solar or wind power. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) says Sweden produces $11.13 of GDP for every kilo of carbon emissions, almost three times the average for rich nations of $3.91. Skog cited companies like flat-pack furniture group IKEA, which aims to be “climate positive” by 2030, to show that strong environmental goals do not undermine profits but said “we have not yet completely decoupled our economy from carbon emissions”. The nation’s greenhouse gas emissions fell 26 percent between 1990-2016, but the rate of decline has slowed in recent years; Rolf Lindahl of Greenpeace said Sweden was doing better than most but not enough in terms of phasing out fossil fuels. Wildfires have made the environment a big issue in elections due on Sept. 9, with most parties pledging tougher action on climate change. The anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats, who oppose Sweden taking a global lead in cutting greenhouse gas emissions because of fears it could slow the economy, are expected to make the biggest gains with an expected fifth of the vote. But mainstream parties on left and right have ruled out cooperating with them.  The Paris agreement set a goal of limiting the rise in average global temperatures to “well below” two degrees Celsius (3.6F) above pre-industrial times, while “pursuing efforts” for 1.5 (2.7F). Temperatures are already up by about 1C. As part of the Paris deal, world leaders asked scientists to write a report about ways to achieve the 1.5C goal, a goal that many experts say is unrealistic. The draft by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to be unveiled in South Korea in October, acknowledges “there is no documented historical precedent” to limit warming to 1.5C but outlines four possible ways to do it. Three rely heavily on unproven technologies for extracting carbon dioxide from nature and burying it. A “low energy demand” (LED) scenario is the only one to focus solely on rapid cuts in emissions and an acceleration of planting forests to absorb more greenhouse gases. Arnulf Gruebler, of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Vienna, the lead author of the LED, said the rise of the internet in recent years showed that new technologies can abruptly transform economies. Smart phones, for instance, could reduce energy demand if they replace cameras, radios, telephones, clocks, televisions and music players rather than being an extra gadget.     But many say the LED scenario is also pie-in-the-sky. Christian Azar, a professor of energy and the environment at Chalmers University in Gothenburg, said it would probably require unpopular restrictions on driving, flying, even diets. “I don’t think that’s going to happen,” he said. U.S. President Donald Trump, who says he doubts climate change is primarily driven by man-made emissions, plans to pull out of the Paris agreement, asserting that it will undermine the economy. So far, the deepest national cuts in emissions delivered by peacetime policies, according to a study in the journal Nature Climate Change, were 4.5 percent a year in Sweden from 1976-86 after oil price spikes drove the nation to adopt nuclear power. Spurred by the oil shocks, Vaxjo was one of the first Swedish cities to build a district heating plant run on biomass in 1980, pumping hot water around the city and generating electricity. After the oil crises “we realized we live virtually in the woodshed,” said Henrik Johansson, environmental coordinator at Vaxjo municipality. “It was a win-win.”  Local forest owners producing timber earned extra money from selling waste branches, sawdust and bark to fuel the new power plant. The forest owners then paid more taxes, enriching the municipality. Overall, Sweden’s green shift was eased by a lack of a strong oil or coal lobby, even though it does have a big, energy-dependent steel industry and car makers such as Volvo. In Vaxjo, buses run on biogas, bus routes are altered to stop at new housing developments even before they are built and changes to building codes are being planned to limit new parking spaces. The city is also upgrading insulation in older buildings and has decreed that 50 percent of all new municipal buildings will be made of wood by 2020. An urban garden near the center grows tomatoes, squash, pumpkins and sunflowers. Sweden’s local municipalities have huge power, raising taxes and spending about 70 percent of all public money on everything from education to pensions. “In Sweden we have very high taxes and we are also the most decentralized country in the world. So what I say happens,” said Mayor Anna Tenje, of the ruling mainstream conservative Moderate Party. It is not always popular. Frank, president of the city council, said Vaxjo’s strong line on the environment had led a satirical newspaper to describe him as the head of a “green fascist state”. And not everything is on track. Gleaming new bicycle racks for commuters at Vaxjo railway station were mostly empty one recent day. Tenje said the biggest headache was persuading people in rural areas to forsake cars run on diesel or gasoline, making the fossil-free goal hard to reach. “We will achieve the goal but maybe it won’t be by 2030,” she said. “Maybe it will take until 2035.”  ($1 = 9.1841 Swedish crowns) Additional reporting by Niklas Pollard in Stockholm; editing by Philippa Fletcher",https://uk.reuters.com/article/climatechange-economy/insight-imitate-vaxjo-as-heat-rises-swedish-city-goes-green-and-thrives-idUKL5N1UY599,23 Aug 2018,"* Vaxjo cuts greenhouse gas emissions sharply as economy

While Danes have mostly enjoyed an unusually sunny summer, the farming sector, a cornerstone in the country’s rise to prosperity, says weather-related losses could exceed $1.2 billion this year. High growth rates at several of the country’s largest firms, which helped the nation recover from the 2008 financial crisis, are also fading. Diabetes drug maker Novo Nordisk, wind turbine maker Vestas, toy maker Lego and jewellery maker Pandora have all seen sales growth slow in the last couple of years. Danish gross domestic product grew 2.3 percent last year, roughly in line with neighbours Sweden and Germany, to 2,150 billion Danish crowns ($330 billion), a growth rate that isn’t seen as achievable in 2018. “We won’t get above 1.5 percent this year, if the figures we’ve seen so far from the statistics office are accurate,” said Jan Storup Nielsen, chief analyst at Nordea. Chief economist at Arbejdernes Landsbank, Signe Roed-Frederiksen, is even more pessimistic, forecasting only around 1 percent growth this year. Exports have been dented by a strengthening of the euro-pegged Danish crown versus the currencies of key export markets Sweden and Britain. Exports could be further hurt by potential escalations of global trade conflicts. After a few years above its long-term growth trend of around 1.7 percent the Danish economy is losing momentum now, said Lars Christensen, economist and CEO of Markets & Money Advisory. “We’re not facing a crisis, but we should be cautious not to expect that the growth rates we’ve seen will continue,” Christensen said. Danske Bank said that labour shortages also threaten to put a brake on growth as the economy gets closer to its maximum capacity. “Although the current growth is not impressive it does demand an increase in employment of 3-4,000 persons each month. We can’t keep that up,” chief economist Las Olsen said. Danish net unemployment is at 3.2 percent, the lowest level since 2009. In the second quarter wages grew by 2.6 percent on the year, the highest growth rate since 2010. New consumer confidence figures, released on Thursday, show Danes remain relatively optimistic despite the potential slowdown, suggesting that consumer spending, another key pillar of the economy, will hold up for the time being. Last year’s GDP was boosted by a one-off payment for a patent from a foreign company to a Danish company. Adjusted for that Danish growth figures would have been around 0.4 percent higher this year.

2018-08-23,"* U.S. Eagle Ford, Australian Wheatstone to arrive Oct-Nov * Steps up Australian imports, seeks European supplies * To continue importing heavy naphtha for splitters (Adds details) By Jane Chung and Seng Li Peng SEOUL/SINGAPORE, Aug 23 (Reuters) - South Korea’s Hanwha Total Petrochemical Co Ltd has increased imports of condensate from the United States and Australia and is seeking more European cargoes to replace Iranian supplies, two industry sources said on Thursday. The move is in line with other South Korean refiners that have replaced Iranian oil with similar imports. The petrochemical producer bought 1 million barrels of U.S. Eagle Ford condensate for November arrival, and it has also stepped up imports from Australia, recently buying Wheatstone condensate for October delivery, the sources said. The purchases were part of Hanwha Total’s efforts to replace Iranian condensate ahead of renewed sanctions on Iran in November, one of the sources said. The sources declined to be named as they were not authorized to speak to media. South Korean refiners and petrochemical producers suspended shipments of Iranian crude and condensate in July, halting all shipments for the first time in six years amid U.S. pressure to cut all imports from Iran from November. South Korea in turn increased its condensate imports from Australia and will lift two 650,000-barrel cargoes of North West Shelf (NWS) condensate in August, the highest volume since March 2015, trade flows data on Thomson Reuters Eikon showed. South Korean companies have also bought NWS condensate loading in September and October, several trade sources said. South Korean banks have halted payment for Iranian oil ahead of the U.S. sanctions that will take effect from November, although Seoul is still working to get a waiver from Washington to import some oil from Iran, other industry sources said. Before the suspensions, South Korea had been the largest buyer of Iranian South Pars condensate (SPC) with imports as high as 6 million barrels in June 2017. The condensate, or ultra light oil, is typically processed at refining units known as splitters to extract heavy naphtha for aromatics production. The loss of Iranian supplies meant Korean buyers had to find and settle for other sources of oil that are not great replacements for SPC as their heavy naphtha yields are lower, trade sources said. In addition to using substitute condensates, South Korean petrochemical companies, such as Hanwha Total, have also been ramping up imports of cheaper heavy naphtha, they said. Hanwha Total has been importing an average of 250,000 tonnes of heavy full-range naphtha a month this year versus 150,000 tonnes a month in 2017, traders said. It paid a $3-a-tonne premium to Japan quotes on a cost-and-freight (C&F) basis for heavy full-range naphtha on Tuesday, down from this year’s high of nearly $17 a tonne.

2018-08-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - Two of Iran’s biggest OPEC rivals, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, are bagging its European oil market share by cranking up production of their lookalike crude grades before the restart of U.S. sanctions designed to halt exports from the Islamic Republic. Iran faces curbs on its energy sector from early November after U.S. President Donald Trump walked away in May from a 2015 deal aimed at restraining Tehran’s nuclear program. Iran’s crude is mainly bought by refiners in China, India, Japan and South Korea, although it has customers in Turkey and the European Union. Buyers seeking an alternative cannot simply opt for any crude on the market.  “As oil sanctions against Iran take effect, perhaps in combination with production problems elsewhere, maintaining global supply might be very challenging and would come at the expense of maintaining an adequate spare capacity cushion,” the International Energy Agency warned recently. [IEA/M] “Thus, the market outlook could be far less calm at that point than it is today,” the Paris-based IEA said.  A senior Iranian diplomat told producer group OPEC on Aug. 19 that no member country should be allowed to take over another’s share of oil exports, in light of Saudi Arabia’s offer to produce more to cover any Iranian shortfalls. But a look at trade flows shows that in Europe at least, Saudi Arabia and Iraq have already succeeded in doing so. Since the start of the year, Iranian flows to Europe have fallen 35 percent to around 415,000 barrels per day (bpd), while Saudi shipments have doubled and those from Iraq have risen 30 percent, according to Reuters flows and ship-tracking data. “Saudi, Basra, Urals,” one refiner said when asked what crude grades were likely alternatives, the latter two hailing from Iraq and Russia respectively. Iraq and Saudi Arabia have raised their oil output by a combined 245,000 bpd since the start of the year and cut the official selling prices for their light crudes for customers in Asia. Iran is the world’s fifth-largest oil exporter and with as much as 1.5 million bpd of supply estimated to be under threat, its customers may be forced to pay handsomely for possible replacements. Crude oil is categorized mainly according to sulfur content and its density relative to water, or American Petroleum Institute gravity. The denser crude is, the lower its gravity.  Crudes that have an API gravity above 35 degrees are categorized as “light”, while those with API gravity between 25 and 35 degrees are “medium” and below 25 degrees, “heavy”.  The lighter the crude, the easier and cheaper it is to extract and transport and the simpler it is to refine. Heavier crudes, which contain more impurities such as sulfur or metals, require additional processing to recover higher-value products. Sulfur content is a second key category. A “sweet” crude is one with a sulfur content of less than 0.5 percent, while the sulfur content of a “sour” crude is above this threshold. Sulfur is corrosive and refineries that run more sour grades require more intense maintenance. The average API for OPEC’s crudes is 33, compared with an average of 35.7 for U.S. grades. Shale, the fastest-growing type of U.S. crude, is lighter still.  (Graphic: Major crude oil grades by type - reut.rs/2OH67XX) Iran Light is a medium sour crude, meaning that shale, however abundant and cheap, cannot act as a replacement on its own. Most refineries worldwide are tooled to run crudes with an API of 32, according to one source at a major European refiner. (Graphic: EIA diagram of a conventional oil refinery - reut.rs/2L0yii9) Refineries regularly blend different types of crude to get as close as possible to their optimal intake.  (Graphic: Major international crude oil grades - reut.rs/2OUtWeI) The impact on the more sour crudes is already apparent. Prices for physical barrels oil have generally declined over the second half of this year, but Russian Urals, British Forties and Angolan Girassol, all sour, are the top-performing grades from around the Atlantic Basin, having lost around 4 percent. That compares with losses of 5-6 percent for lighter, sweeter crudes such as Norwegian Ekofisk or Nigeria’s Bonny Light.

2018-08-23,"* Miner buoyed by high prices for manganese, alumina, metcoal * Alumina market seen tight in the near term, supporting prices * Illawarra coal to ramp back above 8 mln T mark in 2020 (Adds CEO comment in para) By Melanie Burton MELBOURNE, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Australia’s South32 Ltd posted on Thursday a 16 percent rise in its annual underlying earnings, as healthy demand for manganese and alumina helped offset tepid output at its Illawarra coal project. The world’s largest manganese miner’s underlying earnings jumped to $1.33 billion from $1.15 billion the previous year, better than analysts’ expectations of around $1.32 billion. Analysts said South 32’s profit had been lifted by large gains in spot prices for its key commodities, such as manganese, alumina and metallurgical coal, while the miner had managed to keep a better-than-expected lid on costs. “People’s expectations were that costs were going to be an issue, and they weren’t as bad as people made out,” said an analyst at a fund who declined to be named. Comments on the alumina market, which is expected to remain tight into next year due to supply disruptions, were the other major positive from the earnings, said the analyst. South32 shares soared by more than 7 percent to end up 4.9 percent at A$3.42 ($2.50). Manganese prices SMM-EMM-USD have surged nearly 60 percent year-to-date as steel margins have jumped, while alumina prices have climbed by a third after Hydro’s Alunorte in Brazil halved output from February. “This really is ... the time for (our alumina) business to shine,” Chief Executive Graeme Kerr said on an earnings call to analysts. “We are very happy with production performance this year... that has driven strong financial results this year together with prices to mitigate some inflationary cost pressures,” Kerr said. Underlying operating earnings from South32’s Worsley Alumina operations more than doubled to $422 million even as production slipped, making alumina the second-biggest profit driver after manganese. “The key takeaway was softer FY19 cost and capex guidance ... we acknowledge that S32 continues to screen favourably under spot prices,” said RBC in a report. South32’s annual manganese output rose 10 percent while full-year coking coal output fell. Coal, however, beat estimates as production ramped up at Illawarra, where work was stalled at its Appin coal mine last year due to elevated gas levels. The miner said Illawarra continues to recover, with 6.1 million tonnes of production expected in fiscal 2019 and an anticipated return to historical rates of over 8 million tonnes per annum from second-half of fiscal 2020. South32, which was chipped off mining giant BHP Billiton in 2015, resolved to pay a final dividend of 6.2 cents a share. It had paid 6.4 cents per share in 2017. The company, which has nearly doubled in value since it was hived off from BHP, announced in November that it plans to cut interest in its South African coal business and said it completed the purchase of Canada’s Arizona Mining this month. The company expects group production to climb by 5 percent in fiscal 2019. $1 = 1.3669 Australian dollars

2018-08-23,"* World stocks edge lower, European shares edge up * Fresh round of U.S.-China trade tariffs take effect * Trump threatened by legal woes of two former advisers * Dollar snaps losing streak after Fed signal Sept rate hike By Kit Rees LONDON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - World stocks came under pressure on Thursday as new tariffs took effect in the U.S./China trade war and markets speculated about U.S. President Donald Trump’s position following legal rulings against two former advisers. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was 0.1 percent lower by 0822 GMT, while a rise across defensive sectors helped Europe’s STOXX 600 eke out a 0.1 percent gain. Stocks were subdued as the U.S. and China, despite ongoing talks, implemented 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion worth of each other’s goods. The world’s two biggest economic powers have now slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on a combined $100 billion of products since early July, with more in the pipeline, adding to risks to global economic growth. Caroline Simmons, deputy head of the UK chief investment office at UBS Wealth Management, cited such concerns as a reason for paring back an overweight on global equities to a very small position. “We’ve got trade conflicts, and sanctions, in Turkey and Russia, so there are a few things going on that we were a little nervous about,” Simmons said, though her firm still saw upside to equity markets, with good fundamentals. The auto sector, particularly sensitive to tariff developments, was the worst performing in Europe, down 0.7 percent. Earlier, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index stumbled 0.5 percent while Chinese blue-chips gained 0.4 percent. While investors are looking ahead to see how increasing trade barriers between China and the United States might affect corporate earnings, political turmoil also weighed. Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations on Tuesday and former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was found guilty on charges of tax and bank fraud. Investors are considering whether the twin setback will hurt the president and his Republican Party’s prospects in mid-term elections. That weighed on Wall Street overnight and the market ended mixed despite the S&P500 clocking its longest bull run in history. E-Minis for the S&P 500 were also subdued, trading 0.1 percent lower. Cohen’s plea deal does not mean the president has been implicated in anything, press secretary Sarah Sanders said at a White House briefing. “While the (legal issues) shouldn’t substantially alter the stock market landscape, money managers and analysts say the developments raise the likelihood of further turbulence ahead for Mr. Trump heading into the mid-term elections,” said James McGlew, Perth-based analyst at stockbroking firm Argonaut. Political tensions were not limited to the United States. Australian shares slipped 0.3 percent after several senior ministers tendered their resignations on Thursday and demanded a second vote on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership. The Australian dollar fell 0.8 percent for its second straight day of declines. The political uncertainty helped the dollar snap a five-day losing streak, with the greenback in demand after the Federal Reserve suggested that a rate hike for September was on the cards. The dollar index, which measures it against a basket of major currencies, added 0.3 percent to 95.397, pulling off its lowest in three weeks. The euro was off 0.4 percent at $1.1556, not far from Wednesday’s two-week high of $1.1623. The Japanese yen weakened 0.2 percent to 110.78 per dollar. A stronger dollar put pressure on commodities, with Brent crude, the international benchmark, easing to $74.41 while U.S. crude also declined to $67.67. U.S. gold futures for December delivery fell 0.7 percent while spot gold dipped 0.6 percent to $1,188.16 an ounce. Copper fell 1.5 percent.

2018-08-23,"* Underlying profit doubles to $217 mln, beats RBC forecast * On track to cut net debt to below $2 bln this year * Santos shares jump 12 pct to 4-1/2 year high * Analysts say Quadrant acquisition price looks good (Adds comment from CEO, investor, analyst) By Sonali Paul MELBOURNE, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Santos Ltd, Australia’s No.2 independent gas producer, on Thursday reported a near doubling in half-year profit and revived its dividend, just a day after locking in near-term growth with an over $2 billion acquisition. Investors said the results and deal to buy Quadrant Energy in the state of Western Australia vindicated the firm’s decision earlier this year to reject a $10.8 billion takeover bid from private equity-backed Harbour Energy. Santos shares jumped as much as 12 percent to a 4-1/2 year high of A$7.00 on Thursday, the same price Harbour had offered for the firm and a level investors had not expected to be reached again so soon after that bid fell through. “After rejecting Harbour Energy’s bid earlier this year, Santos’s management has had a point to prove to its shareholders – that the company had emerged from survival mode and is ready to grow again. This deal certainly does that,” said Wood Mackenzie analyst Daniel Toleman. JPMorgan likened the acquisition to pulling a “rabbit out of a hat”, while several analysts pointed to strong growth prospects with Quadrant’s Dorado oil find off Western Australia. “The synergies they can get out of full ownership of Quadrant, debt funding the whole thing, it’s a pretty accretive deal for them. I didn’t expect it to happen,” said Andy Forster, a portfolio manager at Argo Investments, Santos’s ninth-largest shareholder. The company reported that underlying profit for the half-year ended June 30 rose to $217 million from $109 million a year earlier, beating a Royal Bank of Canada forecast of $189 million. That came even as first-half output was hit by an outage at the Papua New Guinea LNG (liquefied natural gas) plant after an earthquake. Santos declared an interim dividend of $0.035 a share. It suspended dividends in 2016, diverting cash to pay down debt which had peaked for the construction of its Gladstone LNG project just as oil prices collapsed. It has since cut net debt to $2.4 billion and said it was on course to get it below $2 billion before the end of this year, a year ahead of plan, thanks to sharp cost-cutting and a rebound in oil and gas prices. “We’re fully funded to execute our growth programme and to be able to pay a sustainable dividend going forward,” Santos Chief Executive Kevin Gallagher told Reuters in an interview. The Quadrant acquisition, which Gallagher said the company had been looking at for around a year, is expected to boost the company’s free cash flow by around 17 percent in 2019, assuming oil prices of $65 a barrel. Santos said the cash generated from Quadrant, the biggest gas supplier to the domestic market in Western Australia, will help fund expansions in northern Australia and Papua New Guinea, as well as servicing the $1.2 billion in debt it is taking on for the deal. “What it does do is it gives us more choice. Now we have really good growth opportunities in all of our core assets,” Gallagher said. The company’s weak spot, the Gladstone LNG project, aims to reach output of 6 million tonnes a year by the end of 2019, four years after opening. Gallagher gave no estimate on when the project would hit its capacity of 7.8 million tonnes. Santos still expects 2018 production of 55-58 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) on growing output from its Cooper Basin assets, and maintained its sales volume guidance of 72-76 mmboe.

2018-08-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - Premier Oil is set to raise stable peak production at its Catcher field in Britain’s North Sea by as much as 17 percent to 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day this year, after output reached that level this summer, it said on Thursday. The news came as Premier (PMO.L) reported first-half profit after tax more than doubled to $98.4 million, helped by higher oil prices. First output at the Catcher field marked a milestone for the company last December, leading it to forecast a 10 percent output hike for 2018, with the field’s sustainable peak production - or plateau production - pencilled in at 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). This summer, the field - of which Premier owns half alongside  Cairn (CNE.L), MOL MOLB.BU and Dyas - has reached 70,000 boe/d, of which around 65,000 is oil and the rest gas. “There is significant scope to increase the plateau rate towards that level,” Chief Executive Tony Durrant said.     Premier reiterated it expected group output to reach 80,000-85,000 boe/day this year. (GRAPHIC: Premier Oil Production - reut.rs/2P0kQ06) Core profit, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), rose around a fifth to $388.9 million in the first half, the British energy company said.  Its shares rose as much as 3.6 percent to a two-week high of 125.9 pence in early trading. “At current oil prices (EBITDA) is expected to increase significantly in the second half of this year,” it said. Premier kept its target to reduce its debt pile of around $2.65 billion by $300 million-$400 million by the end of 2018. Looking for growth, Premier on Monday approved its Tolmount gas project in the British North Sea, which is expected to produce around 500 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas from late 2020. Construction for the Tolmount platform is due to start in December, Premier said. Premier’s other two big growth projects are progressing as drilling in Mexico’s closely-watched Zama basin is due to begin early in the fourth quarter. As for its Sea Lion project off the Falkland Islands’ coast in the south Atlantic, Premier has lined up initial agreements on contracts and expects funding to be in place by the end of 2018 and government approvals from mid-2019, Durrant said.

China will promote the use of ethanol in 15 regions this year, including the Beijing and Tianjin municipalities and Hebei province, according to a post on the government’s official website that summarised a Wednesday meeting of the nation’s State Council. The most-active corn futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange settled at 1,889 yuan ($274.80), up 0.7 percent from a day earlier. Prices earlier rose as much as 1.3 percent to an intraday high of 1,900 yuan. The gains also followed customs data released on Thursday showing a big drop in corn imports in July after Beijing imposed hefty tariffs on shipments from the United States as part of its trade conflict. “Capital piled into corn futures betting on increasing demand. The comments are bullish news for ethanol and corn, even if they are still a bit vague,” said Meng Jinhui, analyst with Shengda Futures. Beijing will lay out plans for grain-based ethanol production and accelerate the construction of cassava-based ethanol plants, the government posting said. No further details were given. The statement comes after the government announced in September a plan to blend ethanol into fuel nationwide by 2020 to digest the nation’s vast corn stockpiles. The statement has allayed concerns in the industry that the ethanol policy had stalled, and shares in China’s ethanol producers rallied as the news restored confidence among investors. State-controlled producers, like China’s State Development & Investment Corp (SDIC), agribusiness COFCO and Jilin Fuel, have rushed to draw up plans to invest billions of yuan to double output in the world’s largest car market. But only one major project has received a greenlight to start construction on an ethanol plant. $1 = 6.8740 Chinese yuan

2018-08-23,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Biofuel producer and oil refiner Neste (NESTE.HE) sees good opportunities for its renewable jet fuel despite a cancelled pilot project in Switzerland, a company executive said. The Finnish company is hoping to get a boost for its biofuels business in the coming years from proposed reductions of CO2 emissions in aviation. The pilot project was due to replace at least 1 percent of jet fuel used at Geneva airport with Neste’s biofuel, until Swiss authorities earlier this week told Neste they had decided not to back the scheme. Neste had considered the Geneva project as an important step in ramping up its aviation business, but the head of its renewable products Kaisa Hietala told Reuters the cancellation would not affect Neste’s plans. “It was surprising, a disappointment ... but we have other partners to proceed with, and there are more coming in the pipeline,” she said. Neste has recently announced similar projects with Dallas airport in the United States as well as American Airlines (AAL.O), and the product has already been tested by Boeing (BA.N) and Lufthansa (LHAG.DE). “At the moment, what holds back this market is high price and availability. But when the market is created, there will be more interest,” Hietala said. She added Neste’s plan to expand its biofuel production in Singapore would enable it to provide sufficient volumes for the aviation market. Production at the new line is due to begin in 2022. The International Civil Aviation Organization is targeting carbon-neutral growth in aviation from 2020, Hietala noted.  “Aviation is a global business that grows at a fast pace. Reliability of delivery for the fuel will be an important question.” Alongside Neste, at least one other company, U.S. AltAir Fuels, has tested biofuel for aircraft with pilot projects. Neste has stepped up usage of low-quality feedstock in its biofuels: waste and residue inputs, such as animal fats, make up more than 80 percent of its raw materials. In the first half of 2018, biofuels for road traffic made 70 percent of Neste’s core profit of 679 million euros (603.39 million pounds). “Aviation might become a significant source of income for us in the future,” Hietala said.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.3 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index stumbled 0.6 percent while Chinese shares see-sawed between positive and negative territory. The blue-chip index was last up 0.4 percent. Spreadbetters pointed to a subdued start for European shares with FTSE futures off 0.2 percent. E-Minis for the S&P500 were a shade softer too. While investors are looking ahead to see how increasing trade barriers between China and the United States might affect corporate earnings, political turmoil remained a focus for financial markets on Thursday. A major overhang remains the fallout from criminal probes against Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen and ex-campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Investors are considering whether the setback would hurt the Republican Party’s election prospects. The investigations weighed on Wall Street overnight which ended mixed despite the S&P500 clocking its longest bull run in history. Trump was not charged and Cohen’s plea deal does not mean the president has been implicated in anything, press secretary Sarah Sanders said at a White House briefing. “While the (legal issues) shouldn’t substantially alter the stock market landscape, money managers and analysts say the developments raise the likelihood of further turbulence ahead for Mr. Trump heading into the mid-term elections,” said James McGlew, Perth-based analyst at stockbroking firm Argonaut. “And that uncertainty would likely weigh on the minds of investors.” The political tensions were not limited to the United States though. Australian shares slipped 0.3 percent, falling victim to political uncertainties surrounding Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull after several senior ministers tendered their resignations on Thursday and demanded a second leadership vote. The turmoil also hit the Australian dollar, which became the worst performing major currency on Thursday. It was last down 0.8 percent for its second straight day of decline. Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei added 0.2 percent while Indian shares lost their puff after climbing to a record-high. Another focus for investors will be manufacturing data from Europe and the United States later in the day as investors gauge whether the spectre of a global trade war is hurting economic activity. A survey on Thursday showed Japanese manufacturing activity grew at a slightly faster pace in August although export orders contracted, adding to worries about rising trade protectionism. The United States and China implemented 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion worth of each other’s goods on Thursday. The latest round brings to $50 billion the value of imports subjected to tariffs on either side since early July, and more are in the pipeline, adding to risks for global economic growth. In its research titled “Storm Squalls”, Citi said that divergence in the various trade disputes between the United States and its trading partners is likely to be a key driver for markets. “Trade tensions have narrowed to U.S. vs China; however, there is no such thing as a bilateral trade war,” it added. “Despite recent signs that trade talks are resuming, we expect U.S.-China trade tensions to continue.” The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, added 0.3 percent to 95.415 after six straight sessions of losses took it to the lowest in three weeks.

2018-08-23,"(Adds background on delay, project support and opposition) NANAIMO, British Columbia Aug 22 (Reuters) - Canada’s resource minister said on Wednesday that construction on the Trans Mountain project had faced a delay, but he did not provide an update on when the expansion of the oil pipeline from Alberta to British Columbia’s coast would be complete. The Canadian government agreed in May to buy the pipeline from Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd for C$4.5 billion ($3.5 billion), in an effort to ensure its expansion went ahead. It is currently scheduled to be in service by December 2020. “Yes, there’s a delay because of - the construction was stopped for a couple of months, but this is a project that is moving forward and will continue to move forward until it’s done,” Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi told reporters outside a Cabinet meeting in Nanaimo, British Columbia. Kinder Morgan halted all non-essential work on the project in April, delaying the build for several months. Some preliminary work has since resumed, but actual pipeline construction is not expected to start until the spring of 2019. It remains unclear if the expansion will be delivered on its current timeline and budget. The Canadian government has faced criticism for taking on the massive C$7.4 billion ($5.7 billion) twinning project, which will nearly triple capacity on the existing pipeline to 890,000 barrels per day. That new capacity is desperately needed by Canadian oil producers, who face transportation bottlenecks that have translated into deep discounts on their product relative to the U.S. benchmark. But the project is hotly opposed by environmental activists, some aboriginal groups and the province of British Columbia, who worry about the consequences of a possible oil spill. Canada’s energy regulator gave the go-ahead last week for construction of a large portion of the expansion. Canada’s takeover of the pipeline is expected to close later this year.

U.S. and Chinese officials met for the first time in over two months to find a way out of their deepening trade conflict, but there was no evidence the low-level discussions would halt a new round of U.S. tariffs due Thursday. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.1 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 0.5 percent while South Korea’s Kospi eased 0.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei added 0.2 percent while Chinese shares were a bit firmer too. Moody’s cited the U.S.-led trade war as a risk to global growth with emerging markets already battling high oil prices and a tightening of financial conditions. “Emerging market countries remain inherently vulnerable to the risk of capital outflows associated with tightening global liquidity as advanced economy central banks reverse their quantitative easing measures,” Moody’s added. “Escalating trade frictions further add to overall uncertainty.” In its research titled “Storm Squalls”, Citi said that divergence in the various trade disputes between the United States and its trading partners is likely to be a key driver for markets. “Trade tensions have narrowed to U.S. vs China; however, there is no such thing as a bilateral trade war,” it added. “Despite recent signs that trade talks are resuming, we expect U.S.-China trade tensions to continue.” Australian shares were a tad softer amid political uncertainty over the future of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull after several senior ministers tendered their resignations on Thursday. The turmoil hit the Australian dollar, which slipped 0.8 percent for its second straight day of decline. “The PM has been losing popularity in the polls but as far as the markets are concerned he’s been a steady hand at the tiller for the Australian economy and that’s why we’re seeing this move to the downside in the currency,” said Nick Twidale, analyst at Rakuten Securities. Another focus for investors will be manufacturing data from Europe and the United States later in the day as investors gauge whether the spectre of a global trade war is hurting economic activity. A survey on Thursday showed Japanese manufacturing activity grew at a slightly faster pace in August as domestic demand jumped, but export orders contracted, adding to worries about rising trade protectionism. The lead from Wall Street was mixed overnight even as the S&P 500 marked its longest bull-market run in history. The Dow fell 0.3 percent, the S&P was mostly unchanged and the Nasdaq added 0.4 percent. Investors are considering whether a twin political setback to Trump would hurt the Republican Party’s election prospects and widen a criminal probe that has overshadowed his presidency. Trump was not charged and Cohen’s plea deal does not mean the president has been implicated in anything, press secretary Sarah Sanders said at a White House briefing. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, gained after minutes of the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting showed the U.S. central bank was on course to further hike rates.

2018-08-23,"HANALEI, Hawaii (Reuters) - Micco Godinez, who rents out kayaks on the island of Kauai and loves surfing, said he was twice tempted to hit the waves on Wednesday but kept his focus on a more pressing concern - getting ready to board up his home for a major hurricane. With forecasts calling for Hurricane Lane to strike or brush past Hawaii’s “Garden Isle” on Friday, Godinez, 66, has joined tens of thousands of others on Kauai, and across the state, in the rituals of disaster preparation. Lane, wavering between Category 4 and Category 5 strength on the five-step Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, churned toward the U.S. Pacific island state with sustained winds of up to 155 miles per hour (250 kph) on Wednesday, as authorities urged residents to stock up on water, food and medicines. Across Hawaii, jittery residents lined up at hardware centers, gasoline stations and grocery stores. But nowhere was the sense of urgency perhaps more palpable than on Kauai, where torrential rains four months ago triggered widespread flooding that destroyed homes and washed out roads. “Some people here were just wiped out in that flood. It rained 50 inches (127 cm) in 24 hours,” said Hanalei resident Charlie Cowden, who owns several surf shops on the island. “Now there is this.” Many older residents recalled even greater devastation from the last Category 4 storm to pummel Hawaii, Hurricane Iniki, which made landfall on Kauai in September 1992, killing six people and leveling or damaging more than 14,000 dwellings. Godinez, who lives two blocks from the ocean in the bayside town of Hanalei on Kauai’s north shore, said he spent part of his day shopping for lumber and a recharging device for his portable drill. He described the mood in town as “pleasantly apprehensive” and said he even felt the familiar pang of one of his favorite pastimes. “Twice the surf was up, and twice I wanted to go surfing, but I had other things pressing on my mind.” He recalled getting up early to drive to a Home Depot building-supply outlet before it opened at 6 a.m., only to find two dozen others already lined up ahead of him. “There’s a run on plywood,” he said. “It was slim pickings when I was there.” Pausing later after filling up jugs of water, Godinez said he and his wife would spend the rest of the day taking measurements and cutting plywood to fit over more than 18 windows on their two-story house. “Measure twice, cut once, and away we go,” he said, adding they would wait until Thursday for the latest forecasts before deciding whether to go ahead with fastening the boards to the windows. Since Hanalei is on the opposite side of Kauai from where the hurricane is most likely to come ashore, Godinez said he was less concerned about ocean storm surge than ferocious winds. Godinez said he, his wife and two guests planned to “hunker down” in a first-floor laundry room at the height of the storm, should it make landfall by late Thursday or early on Friday. With two small laundry windows sealed up and probably no electricity, except for battery-powered flashlights, “It’s going to be hot and dark,” he said.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $67.95 per barrel at 0044 GMT, up 9 cents, or 0.1 percent, from their last settlement. “Oil prices jumped overnight as inventories drew down more than expected,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities. U.S. commercial crude oil inventories C-STK-T-EIA fell by 5.8 million barrels in the week to Aug. 17 to 408.36 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday. International markets were more cautious as the ongoing trade spat between the United States and China was seen as a drag on economic growth, traders said.
