2018-12-31,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Equities around the world rose on Monday as possible progress in resolving the trade dispute between the United States and China engendered some investor optimism in what has been a punishing end of year for markets. The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index advanced in light trading volume after U.S. President Donald Trump said he held a “very good call” with China’s President Xi Jinping on Saturday to discuss trade and said “big progress” was being made. Chinese state media were more reserved, saying Xi hoped the negotiating teams could meet each other halfway and reach an agreement that was mutually beneficial. The rise in U.S. equities mirrored that in Asian and European markets, which were also buoyed by trade optimism.  Despite Monday’s advance, equities ended the year largely in the red, victims of investor anxiety over trade tensions and slowing economic growth. Asian and European shares had been sluggish for much of the year, and in recent months, U.S. stocks  followed suit.  “If the European economy continues to decelerate and the Chinese economy decelerates because of tariffs, there is definitely going to be spillover to the United States,” said Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at Boston Private. The S&P 500 dropped more than 9 percent in December, its largest decline since the Great Depression. For the year, the index slid more than 6 percent, its biggest drop since the 2008 financial crisis. Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended down 16 percent for the year, while the STOXX 600 was more than 13 percent lower. MSCI’s gauge of stocks around the globe .MIWD00000PUS fell 11.1 percent in 2018. A further blow to the Chinese economy could spur a quicker resolution to the U.S.-China trade dispute and thus boost global equities, Saccocia said. Survey data on Monday showed Chinese manufacturing activity contracting for the first time in two years even as the service sector improved. On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 265.06 points, or 1.15 percent, to 23,327.46, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 21.11 points, or 0.85 percent, to 2,506.85 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 50.76 points, or 0.77 percent, to 6,635.28. MSCI’s emerging markets index .MSCIEF rose 0.32 percent, while the MSCI world stock index .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.66 percent. Global markets in 2018: tmsnrt.rs/2AmRgNB Yields on U.S. Treasuries fell on Monday, keeping with the trend over the past two months as investors moved to lower-risk investments. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 15/32 in price to yield 2.686 percent, compared with 2.738 percent late on Friday. The fall in Treasury yields reflects expectations of a slowdown, if not a pause altogether, in the Federal Reserve’s progression of interest-rate hikes. The precipitous drop in yields has undermined the U.S. dollar in recent weeks. The dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.3 percent and on track to end December with a loss. It is, however, still set for its highest yearly percentage gain since 2015. On Monday, the dollar fell to a six-month low against the yen JPY=. The euro EUR= was up 0.2 percent to $1.1459, on track to end the year down nearly 5 percent against the dollar. Oil posted its first year of losses since 2015, with Brent crude futures LCOc1 down 19.5 percent and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures CLc1 down 24.8 percent. On Monday, Brent crude settled 59 cents higher, or 1.11 percent, at $53.80 a barrel. U.S. crude settled up 8 cents, or 0.18 percent, at $45.41 a barrel.

2018-12-31,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil prices ended with full-year losses for the first time since 2015, after a desultory fourth quarter that saw buyers flee the market over growing worries about a supply glut and mixed signals related to renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran. For the year, U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI)futures slumped nearly 25 percent, while Brent tumbled more than 19.5 percent.  The market had been on track for solid gains for the year until October, when the United States granted larger-than-expected waivers to importers of Iran’s oil, and as demand in emerging economies started to sag.  That combination dragged down both benchmarks from four-year highs above $76 a barrel and $86 a barrel, respectively, and even a late-year decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia, known collectively as OPEC+, to ratchet down output was not enough to restore bullish sentiment. “We’re flush with oil,” said Phillip Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures. “OPEC is out there cutting, but the market isn’t really pricing that in.” Oil prices fell more than a third this quarter, the steepest quarterly decline since the fourth quarter of 2014.  For a graphic on oil prices in 2018, see: tmsnrt.rs/2GYkqYO. Crude oil futures posted modest gains on Monday. Brent settled up 59 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $53.80 a barrel, while WTI settled 8 cents higher at $45.41 a barrel. Analysts have turned bearish on 2019, according to a Reuters poll. A survey of 32 economists and analysts forecast an average Brent price of $69.13 next year, more than $5 below analyst projections a month ago, and compared with an average real price of $71.76 in 2018. (GRAPHIC: Oil prices in 2018 - tmsnrt.rs/2AmreKo)  Brent, the global benchmark, rose by almost a third between January and October, to a high of $86.74. That was the highest level since late 2014, the start of a deep market slump amid bulging global oversupply.  Prices rose through most of the year, continuing 2017’s recovery after several years of weak pricing that sent oil-rich economies into tailspins and forced hundreds of U.S. energy companies into bankruptcy. Renewed U.S. sanctions against major producer Iran, as well as healthy economic conditions and concerns about crude supplies, had elevated prices until October.  However, when Washington gave unexpectedly generous sanction waivers to Iran’s biggest oil buyers, concerns about a global oversupply and sluggish economic growth clouded markets.     “OPEC and non-OPEC producers found themselves competing with additional supplies from the U.S. that overwhelmed the market,” said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.   OPEC+ opened its taps in autumn as demand reduced global inventories, then reversed course as priced tumbled.  The producers’ group now plans to cut 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) beginning Jan. 1. It acted as fears a U.S.-China trade war, falling U.S. stock prices and rising U.S. shale output and interest rates would hurt global demand pushed crude lower.  A tweet by U.S. President Donald Trump claiming progress on a possible U.S.-China trade deal pushed crude prices up more than 2 percent in early trading on Monday. But oil lost ground as traders focused on data showing China’s economy slowed further in December, analysts said.     Chinese manufacturing activity declined in December for the first time in more than two years, according to a national purchasing managers’ survey. The United States, which broke its 1970 peak of 10.04 million bpd in November 2017, surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia to became the world’s top producer in 2018, hitting an all-time high of more than 11.5 million bpd in October, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Monday. U.S. drillers added about 138 oil rigs in 2018, the second year in a row of boosting the rig count. But North American producers will likely begin to reduce spending on drilling in 2019 as prices fall below break-even levels for new wells in the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford shale field in Texas, analysts said.  “You could have a meaningful rally,” said John Saucer, vice president of research and analysis at Mobius Risk Group in Houston. “More companies are reducing capital expenditures, and production probably isn’t going to go as high as forecast.”  Still, prices could stagnate for weeks until OPEC’s cuts begin to affect global supplies in mid-January and early February.  Money managers trimmed bullish wagers on U.S. crude to the lowest level in more than two years in the week to Dec. 18, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in its most recent report. New CFTC data will not be released until the partial shutdown of the federal government ends. “The expectation was more money would be going into long positions as various fund managers thought they should have positions in oil,” said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service. “Yet we end the year with the lowest number in net length” since August 2016.

Russia’s emergencies ministry told the news agency that four people had been recovered alive from the nine-storey building in Magnitogorsk, an industrial city some 1,700 km (1,050 miles) east of Moscow in the southern Urals. News agency TASS said 79 people were unaccounted for, quoting Chelyabinsk regional Deputy Governor Oleg Klimov. The emergencies ministry said the blast, probably caused by a gas leak, damaged 48 apartments.  RIA said it ripped through the building at around 0600 a.m. (0100 GMT) when many residents were asleep. Monday is a public holiday in Russia.  There have been several similar incidents in Russia in recent years due to ageing infrastructure and poor safety regulations surrounding gas usage.

Larco, which is 55 percent owned by the Greek state, owes about 280 million euros ($319 million) in unpaid electricity bills to state-controlled power utility PPC, also a minority shareholder in the company. The Greek government has been working on a plan to avert a closure of Larco, asking the producer to cut its output to align itself with lower nickel prices and to reduce wage costs. PPC warned Larco earlier this month it would pull the plug on Jan. 1, 2019, unless the company cut its production costs to meet its obligations. PPC said on Monday that it will continue to supply Larco until Jan. 11, showing its goodwill since further talks are planned. It said it has decided to give Larco more time, although the company’s proposals failed to meet conditions set by PPC, including the full payment of outstanding monthly bills. Larco employs about 1,000 people in Greece. According to Refinitiv Eikon data, the company produced 21,800 tonnes of nickel in 2016.

2018-12-31,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s finance ministry has exempted rupee payments made to the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) for crude oil imports from a steep withholding tax, according to a government order reviewed by Reuters. The exemption, put in place December 28 but backdated to November 5, will allow Indian refiners to settle about $1.5 billion of outstanding payments to NIOC. Those have been building up since Tehran was put under stringent U.S. sanctions in early November. The two countries on Nov. 2 signed a bilateral agreement to settle oil trades through an Indian government-owned bank, UCO Bank (UCBK.NS), in the Indian currency, which is not freely traded on international markets.  However, the income of a foreign company that is deposited in an Indian bank account is subject to a withholding tax of 40 percent plus other levies, leading to a total take by the authorities of 42.5 percent. That made the agreement unworkable for Iran and led to the freeze in payments by the refiners until the exemption could be introduced. Iran will be able to use the rupee funds for a range of expenses - including imports from India, the cost of its missions in the country, direct investment in Indian projects, and its financing of Iranian students in India, according to another government document reviewed by Reuters. It can also invest the funds in Indian government debt securities. “In the previous round of sanctions Iran was allowed to use funds for imports from India but this time we have expanded the scope for use of funds to benefit both nations,” said an Indian  government official, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. The move may help India fix its trade balance, which is currently tilted in favour of Iran. The tax exemption order, though, only refers to crude oil. That means it does not apply to imports of other commodities, such as fertiliser, liquefied petroleum gas and wax. India, Iran’s top oil client after China, has turned to paying for Iranian oil in rupees as major banking channels dealing in global currencies are closed off by the U.S. sanctions. “Passing of this notification eases constraints for Indian refiners to make payment,” said Sanjay Sudhir, joint Secretary in India’s oil ministry. An official from India’s top refiner and Iran’s top customer in the country, Indian Oil Corp (IOC.NS), said his company would start making payments to Iran from January. The finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Indian Oil Corp and UCO Bank also did not respond. Last month, the United States introduced the sanctions aimed at crippling Iran’s oil revenue-dependent economy because of its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes and its support for militant proxies in the Middle East. Washington did, though, give a six-month waiver from sanctions to eight nations, including India, and allowed them to import some Iranian oil. India’s overall imports from Iran totalled about $11 billion in April-November 2018, with oil accounting for about 90 percent of the imports. Iran will be able to register as a foreign portfolio investor, allowing it to invest in Indian government debt. The direct investment provision could help Iran in participating in Indian oil refiner Chennai Petroleum Corp Ltd’s (CHPC.NS) expansion plans. Iran owns 15.4 percent of the company. Iran which used to be the third biggest oil supplier to India slipped to No. 6 in November, according to ship tracking data and industry sources.

2018-12-31,"GUWAHATI, India (Reuters) - Relatives of at least 15 Indian miners trapped in a “rat-hole” mine for 18 days said on Monday they have given up hope that any of them would be found alive, even as rescue operations were stepped up.     “We want his body back so that we can give him a decent burial,” said the uncle of 26-year old Omar Ali, who is among those trapped in the mine. The miners were trapped on Dec. 13, when an illegal mine in India’s northeastern Meghalaya state, was flooded. Thousands of workers, including children, have been killed in so-called rat-hole mining, which involves miners crawling into narrow shafts on bamboo ladders to mine for low-quality coal, in Meghalaya. The state banned such unregulated mining in 2014 but it still goes on in some places. A survivor of the disaster, Sayeb Ali, 24, said he too thought there was little chance of anyone coming out alive. He said 17 miners were trapped in the accident. It was not clear why his figure differed from the government account of 15 miners. Sayeb Ali said he has survived as he was not deep inside the very narrow mine shaft when disaster struck. “The people who were digging coal went deep inside and cart-pullers like me and the other four who survived were about eight to 10 feet inside,” Sayeb Ali, who is not related to Omar Ali, told Reuters by telephone. India is one of the world’s most dangerous countries to be a coal miner, with one miner dying every six days on average in 2017, according to government data. Government officials said on Monday rescuers have only been able to find three helmets and two axes underground.      Officials said the navy on Sunday sent 15 divers with cameras and specialist equipment into the mine in an attempt to reach the bottom of the pit, but they had found nothing. “The problem is there is murky water that entered the rat-hole pit from a nearby river,” Santosh Kumar Singh, an official with the National Disaster Response Force, told Reuters.

2018-12-31,"BENGALURU (Reuters) - Crude oil prices look likely to trade below $70 per barrel in 2019 as surplus production, much of it from the United States, and slowing economic growth undermine OPEC-led efforts to shore up the market, a Reuters poll showed on Monday. A survey of 32 economists and analysts forecasts the North Sea Brent crude oil benchmark LCOc1 will average $69.13 per barrel in 2019, more than $5 lower than last month’s projection. Brent has averaged $71.76 in 2018. “The first half of 2019 will be dominated by concerns about oversupply,” said Ashley Petersen of Stratas Advisors. The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers including Russia, known collectively as OPEC+, agreed earlier this month to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) to try to drain global crude inventories and support prices. But the cuts are not due to take place until January and prices have fallen more than 15 percent since the announcement. “The market had largely priced in renewed production cuts from OPEC. As a result, we expect prices to sink if OPEC or Russia diverge from their production quotas notably,” said Cailin Birch, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. “We expect the cuts to be renewed in April, when the deal comes up for review, as higher output from the U.S. and weakening global demand require continued restraint.” Oil prices have fallen more than 40 percent from multi-year highs reached in early October on concerns about the impact of a trade dispute between the United States and China on global economic growth and demand for oil. [O/R] Another potential headwind next year is slowing consumption. Many analysts project demand growth of a little over 1 million bpd in 2019, compared with an increase of 1.54 million bpd in 2018, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Meanwhile, U.S. shale oil output growth is expected to remain robust, adding to supply. The United States this year surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world’s biggest oil producer, with overall U.S. crude production climbing to a record 11.7 million bpd. “We expect U.S. (companies) will increase shale oil production continuously over the next year,” said Adrià Morron Salmeron, economist at CaixaBank Research. The Reuters poll forecast U.S. light crude CLc1 would average $61.05 per barrel in 2019, versus $67.45 projected in the previous poll. It has averaged $64.98 in 2018. Analysts believe the end of U.S. sanctions waivers on Iran’s oil exports will put extra pressure on oil prices.

2018-12-31,"LONDON, Dec 31 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Britain appointed its first food waste chief on Monday to help drive a campaign to reduce the millions of tonnes of food binned every year by restaurants, supermarkets and manufacturers. Ben Elliot, the nephew of Camilla the Duchess of Cornwall and wife of heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, was appointed to the one-year voluntary role of Food Surplus and Waste Champion by Environment Secretary Michael Gove. Food waste is increasing viewed as unethical in a world of rising hunger, as well as environmentally destructive, dumped in landfills where it rots, releasing greenhouse gases, while fuel, water, and energy needed to grow, store and carry it is wasted. “There continues to be an unforgivable amount of food waste which is both morally deplorable and largely avoidable,” said Elliot, co-founder of luxury lifestyle group Quintessentially and a philanthropic foundation that works with food charities. “As a nation, we need to stop this excessive waste and ensure that surplus food finds its way to people in our society who need it most, and not let it get thrown away and go to landfill,” he said in a statement. Britain has among the lowest levels of food redistribution in Europe, a system where out-of-date but edible food is given to people in need via charities and food banks, according to FareShare, a leading British food bank charity. Major supermarkets, food manufacturers and restaurants in September backed a drive to halve Britain’s food waste by 2030 and save the nation 10 billion pounds ($13 billion) a year. Tesco, Nestle and Coca-Cola were among at least 70 leading companies to sign up to a government-backed plan to reduce the 10 million tonnes of fruit, vegetables and other foods that are binned every year, worth about 20 billion pounds. In his new role Elliot will work with food businesses across manufacturing, retail and hospitality to tackle waste “from farm to fork”, the government said, under a voluntary monitoring plan. The government said earlier this month it would look at introducing a requirement for businesses to report annually on food waste policies and set mandatory targets. Other European countries, including France and Italy, have already adopted national measures to fight food waste. “Food waste is an economic, environmental and moral scandal. We must end it,” Gove said in a statement. Globally, one third of all food produced - worth $1 trillion - is binned every year, according to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and researchers fear annual food waste could rise by a third to 2.1 billion tonnes by 2030. World leaders pledged to halve food waste by 2030 as part of the global development goals set by the United Nations in 2015.

2018-12-31,"* Oil, industrial metals in red on concerns over slowing growth * London cocoa up 30 pct as dry weather boosts speculative buying * Wheat up 18 pct on hopes of strong demand for U.S. supplies * China’s pollution crackdown lifts steel prices; palm oil down By Naveen Thukral SINGAPORE, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Cocoa prices ended 2018 with strong gains, leading generally firmer agricultural markets, but the year marked falls for most major commodities as increasing global economic uncertainty hit metals and oil. Worries about slackening growth in China, the world’s second-largest economy, and trade talks between Washington and Beijing will be the main focus in the new year, analysts said, while oil markets fear a growing oversupply. “We had a dramatic decline in the crude oil market as global supplies are rising, not just the United States but also Saudi Arabia and Russia,” said Phin Ziebell, senior economist at National Australia Bank, who covers agriculture, oil and gas markets. “(However) agriculture markets, cocoa and wheat, in particular have had a strong performance, which has been driven by fundamentals,” he said. London cocoa prices climbed almost 30 percent in 2018, recovering from six-year lows, as dry weather in top producer Ivory Coast boosted speculative fund inflows, although supply is now picking up. Wheat is also set for a positive finish, up around 20 percent, on expectations of strong demand for U.S. cargoes as the rival Black Sea region runs of out of supplies. Soybeans, though, have been hit by the U.S.-China trade war. Benchmark Brent crude oil futures, tipped by some analysts in September to top $100 a barrel, instead plunged by almost 40 percent from their 2018 peak a month later of $86.74 to end the year around $53.75. The slump came after the Washington gave unexpectedly generous sanction waivers to Iran’s biggest oil buyers and as concerns over a Sino-American trade dispute dented the outlook for oil demand. The United States also emerged as the world’s biggest oil producer in 2018 amid rising global supplies. Oil markets went “into a tailspin in the last few months of this year, as U.S. production continued its unstoppable pace of growth and the (U.S.) Administration pushed weaker than expected enforcement of sanctions on Iran,” said U.S. investment firm Height Securities. U.S. crude lost a quarter of its value in 2018, while Brent is down around 20 percent. In grain markets, Chicago wheat futures gained by almost a fifth, rising for a second year in a row after several years in the doldrums, and boosted by hopes of higher demand for U.S. cargoes in the first half of 2019. Surplus wheat supplies are dwindling in the world’s biggest exporter Russia after strong sales since July, while Australia - typically the No. 4 exporter - is suffering from a second year of drought. The Washington-Beijing trade war has dragged down U.S. soybean prices as China, which buys 60 percent of the oilseed traded worldwide, has been taking mainly Brazilian cargoes for much of 2018. This is expected to result in large unsold stocks in the United States, although recent signs of improving trade relations between the two countries could support prices early next year. Malaysian palm oil futures, however, fell about 15 percent in 2018 due to a glut, while Tokyo rubber dropped nearly 18 percent on China growth worries. Concerns over slowing growth in top industrial metals consumer China also took a toll on zinc, copper and aluminium prices. London Metal Exchange zinc suffered the biggest decline in 2018 among base metals with a loss of more than 26 percent, copper gave up about 16 percent and aluminium 18 percent. Chinese steel prices are on track for a positive finish in 2018 as the country’s crackdown on pollution forces mills to reduce production, curbing supplies in the world’s top consumer. However, prices for steel making raw material iron ore fell. Reporting by Naveen Thukral; additional reporting by Henning

2018-12-31,"SINGAPORE, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher on the last trading day of the year on Monday, taking a cue from firmer stock markets, but remain on track for the first yearly decline in three years amid concerns of a supply glut. Hints of progress on a possible U.S.-China trade deal helped bolster sentiment, which has been battered by concerns over a weaker global economic outlook. Brent crude futures - the international benchmark for oil prices - rose 17 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $53.38 a barrel by 0115 GMT. Brent has shed about 20 percent in 2018 following two years of successive growth. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $45.52 a barrel, up 19 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last close. WTI is down nearly 25 percent this year. Crude prices have been closely tracking equity markets during volatile trading for both asset classes last week. “Investors are looking for bargains in an illiquid market (today)... If Trump gets over trade issues with China expect economic demand to surge,” said Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Probis Securities in Sydney. “Also, drivers on Iran with waivers ending in May are still not been put to bed. Hence, it could get ugly at any time and I expect this is a diversion for Trump when needed,” Barratt added. U.S. President Donald Trump said he had a “long and very good call” with Chinese President Xi Jinping and that a possible trade deal between the United States and China was progressing well. Meanwhile, imports of Iranian crude oil by major buyers in Asia hit their lowest in more than five years in November as U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports took effect last month. Asia’s imports from Iran are set to rise again in December after the U.S. granted temporary waivers to some countries, but is not known how much Iran will be able to export once the waivers expire around the start of May. “Investors will require substantive indications from global economic fundamentals and oil inventories to move in positively on oil prices in 2018,” said Benjamin Lu Jiaxuan, commodities analyst at Singapore-based brokerage firm Phillip Futures. “We postulate for a gentle recovery for oil prices into the first quarter of 2019 though marked volatility can snap oil prices south in lieu of market uncertainties and key events such as Brexit, U.S.-China trade truce deal, U.S. monetary policy, U.S.-Iran sanctions.” The current downward pressure on oil prices should likely taper off from January, when OPEC-led supply cuts commence, analysts said. Earlier this month, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies including Russia, agreed to curb output by 1.2 million bpd starting in January in a bid to clear a supply overhang and prop up prices.

The story was much the same across the globe, with the vast majority of the major stock indices in the red. The S&P 500 is off almost 10 percent for December, its worst month since February 2009. That left it down 15 percent for the  quarter and 7 percent for the year. “Simply looking at the markets would suggest that the global economy is headed into recession,” said Robert Michele, chief investment officer and head of fixed income at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “However, while we agree the global economy is in a growth slowdown, we don’t see an impending recession,” he added, in part because the Federal Reserve could provide a policy cushion. “Already, commentary out of the Fed suggests that it is nearing the end of a three-year journey to normalise policy,” argued Michele. Indeed, Fed fund futures have largely priced out any hike for next year and now imply a quarter point cut by mid-2020. The Treasury market clearly thinks the Fed is done on hikes, with yields on two-year paper having fallen to just 2.52 percent from a peak of 2.977 percent in November. The $15.5 trillion market is heading to its biggest monthly rally in 2-1/2 years, according to an index compiled by Bloomberg and Barclays. The precipitous drop in yields has undermined the U.S. dollar in recent weeks. Against a basket of currencies, it was on track to end December with a loss of 0.9 percent but was still up on the year as a whole. It has also had a tough month against the yen with a loss of 2.8 percent, and was last trading at 110.36. However, 2018 was a pretty stable year for the pair given it spent all of it in a narrow trading range of 104.55 to 114.54. The euro was ending the month on a firmer note at $1.1443 , but still nursed losses of almost 5 percent for the year to date. That was trivial compared with the hit oil prices have taken in the last couple of months, with Brent down almost 40 percent since its peak in October. Early Monday, the crude benchmark was up 30 cents at $53.51 a barrel but down 20 percent for the year. U.S. crude futures nudged up 24 cents to $45.57. Gold was ending the year on a high note after rallying almost 5 percent in the past month to stand at $1,279.06 an ounce.
