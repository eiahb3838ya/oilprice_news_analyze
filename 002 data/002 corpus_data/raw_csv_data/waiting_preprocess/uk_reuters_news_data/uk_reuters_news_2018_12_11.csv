2018-12-11,"PARIS (Reuters) - French oil and gas major Total SA (TOTF.PA) has offered a 3.1 percent increase in compensation plus an exceptional 1,500-euro (£1,341) bonus to all employees in France, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said on Tuesday. Pouyanne said on Twitter that the offer was made to unions, taking into account the company’s good results in 2018. Total held its annual salary negotiation with unions on Tuesday. Around 32 percent of the company’s 98,000 employees were in France as of the end of December 2017, according to company documents. The increase and bonus measure comes after a week-long strike in November over pay and bonuses by hard-left union CGT. The protest disrupted production and distribution at Total’s refineries and fuel depots in France. French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday urged companies that are able to do so to offer an exceptional bonus to their employees to boost purchasing power, as part of measures to appease the so-called yellow vests protests that have rocked France in the past weeks. Several French companies including media and telecom groups Orange (ORAN.PA), Publicis (PUBP.PA), Iliad (ILD.PA) and Altice (ATCA.AS) announced employee bonuses on Tuesday, while bosses of  major banks agreed to freeze the fees they charge households next year in a show of support for Macron’s plan.

Investors also had a wary eye on events in Strasbourg, where a lone gunman shot dead at least four people and wounded 11 others near a Christmas market. The European Parliament, which is sitting in Strasbourg this week, was put into lockdown. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan firmed 0.09 percent in sporadic early trading. Nikkei futures hinted at a modest opening bounce after two days of losses, while E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 edged up 0.07 percent. Sterling slid on reports Conservative lawmakers could vote on a no confidence motion in May’s leadership as soon as Wednesday night. The political ructions come a day after her decision to delay a vote in parliament on her Brexit deal for fear of a rout angered many in her Conservative Party. The news sent the pound reeling to a 2-month trough of $1.2484, a loss of 1.9 percent in just two sessions. The euro climbed to 90.62 pence, even as it eased on the dollar to $1.1318. The dollar was being viewed as the best of a bad bunch and rose to 97.466 on a basket of currencies. “The market is concerned that May could be replaced by a Brexit-supporter, increasing the chance of a no-deal scenario,” said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at NAB. “Bottom line: there is great uncertainty about whether Theresa May can survive as PM and what the prospects are for a general election, new referendum or a hard Brexit.” “CHOP-FEST” Sentiment had got a brief lift on Tuesday from reports China was considering cutting import tariffs on American-made cars to 15 percent from the current 40 percent. Yet there were also reports the U.S. would release evidence this week detailing Chinese hacking and economic espionage. “Even if this (auto) step is taken it just removes what was a retaliatory measure to begin with,” noted ANZ economist David Plank. “Moreover, markets are still be nervous about the evolving Huawei situation.” “Whatever the case, market price action is somewhat of a chop-fest, right now, as it swings around on each new headline.” The U.S. State Department expressed concern on Tuesday about reports a Canadian citizen has been detained in China following the arrest of Huawei Technologies’ chief financial officer in Canada. Markets were also jolted when President Donald Trump threatened to shut down the government over funding for a wall he has promised to build on the southern border with Mexico. Such cross currents left Wall Street mixed, with the Dow down 0.22 percent and the S&P 500 0.04 percent, while the Nasdaq added 0.16 percent. Investors were looking ahead to the U.S consumer price report later on Wednesday where an expected slowdown in headline inflation would only reinforce speculation of fewer rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. Wagers on a more restrained Fed helped gold steady near a five-month peak of $1,243.11 an ounce. Oil bounced a little after industry data showed a surprisingly large draw on stockpiles. Brent futures added 54 cents to $60.51 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose 97 cents to $51.97.

The Texas operation will close between late 2019 and 2020, according to the spokesman, who called the decision “difficult.”  In a letter to the Texas Workforce Commission, Siemens also pointed to overcapacity within its network.

2018-12-11,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of global stock markets edged higher in volatile trade on Tuesday as investors waded through a chunk of geopolitical headlines, including threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to shut down the government over a funding fight and signs of a thaw in the U.S.-China trade battle.  European shares closed higher, in part from a boost in auto shares, and Wall Street opened on a strong note after a report that China is moving to cut import tariffs on American-made cars, which market participants viewed as a sign China is ready to make concessions on trade. That report came after Chinese Vice Premier Liu He exchanged views on the next stage of trade talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.  But U.S. stocks lost steam after the open and fell further after Trump openly sparred about government funding with the top two Democratic lawmakers during an Oval Office meeting, raising doubts a deal would be possible ahead of a deadline later this month.  “The key drivers of today’s volatility are the political and geopolitical headlines,” said Carol Schleif, deputy chief investment officer at Abbot Downing in Minneapolis. “We can’t control the headlines but the thing we can lean on is that the underlying fundamentals remain solid,” Schleif said. The S&P 500 traded in a wide range, gaining nearly 1.4 percent at the high and falling 0.62 percent at the low.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 53.02 points, or 0.22 percent, to 24,370.24, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 0.94 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,636.78 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 11.31 points, or 0.16 percent, to 7,031.83. Germany's DAX .GDAXI, which entered bear market territory last week and is Europe's most China-sensitive market, climbed 1.5 percent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  rose 1.53 percent, and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.09 percent, snapping a five-session skid. The uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the European Union, or Brexit, continued to haunt investors and held sterling near 20-month lows after British Prime Minister Theresa May postponed a vote on her deal. On Tuesday, German leader Angela Merkel ruled out further Brexit negotiations but said efforts were being made to give Britain reassurances.  Reports a threshold was reached to trigger a no confidence vote in May sent sterling to a fresh session low. Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2481, down 0.62 percent after hitting a low of 1.2479. After an initial softening, the dollar index .DXY, which  tracks the U.S. currency against six major peers, rose 0.25 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.31 percent to $1.132.     European bond markets were focused on France a day after President Emmanuel Macron announced wage rises for the poorest workers and tax cuts for pensioners, in further government concessions aimed at defusing weeks of often-violent protests, raising concerns over fiscal spending. In response, French bond yields rose to their highest spread in 20 months over Germany’s yields DE10FR10=RR, at 47.81 basis points. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR last fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.879 percent, from 2.856 percent late on Monday. Oil prices rebounded after having sunk on Monday, buoyed by an outage that dented Libyan production, but pared gains on the U.S. government shutdown concerns.

2018-12-11,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - China has agreed to cut tariffs on U.S.-built cars and auto parts to 15 percent from the current 40 percent, a Trump administration official said on Tuesday, setting the stage for a new talks aimed at easing the bitter trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Washington still had not received documentation nor timing details of the tariff reduction, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  China’s plan was communicated during a phone call between Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday morning Beijing time, the official said. News of the move, also reported by other media outlets and automotive executives briefed on the talks, boosted automakers’ shares and helped lift U.S. shares more broadly before worries about a U.S. government shutdown prompted a pullback. Meanwhile, U.S.-China tensions over the Canadian arrest of a top executive at Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies appeared to rise, as Canada confirmed that one of its citizens had been detained in China. Canada said there was no direct link to the Huawei case, but two sources said the U.S. State Department was considering a travel warning of risks to U.S. citizens in China due to retaliation over the Huawei case. U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed at a Dec. 1 meeting in Argentina to a truce that delayed by 90 days a planned Jan. 1 U.S. increase of tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion (£157.13 billion) worth of Chinese goods. But few details of plans for talks have emerged since then.   The two sides are expected to negotiate over U.S. demands for stronger Chinese protections for U.S. intellectual property, an end to forced technology transfers and greater market access to China for U.S. companies. Lighthizer has said March 1 is a “hard deadline” for increasing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods if no deal can be reached by then. Trump, without providing details, wrote in an early morning post on Twitter: “Very productive conversations going on with China! Watch for some important announcements!” White House adviser Kellyanne Conway welcomed reports of the auto tariff cut. “It’s really great news, and I hope our friends in the auto industry see it that way as well,” she told reporters at the White House. Officials at the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Trade Representative’s office declined to provide details of the trade call. China’s commerce ministry said, “Both sides exchanged views on putting into effect the consensus reached by the two countries’ leaders at their meeting, and pushing forward the timetable and road map for the next stage of economic and trade consultations work.” China had cut its global auto import tariff to 15 percent from 25 percent in May, but in July added on a punitive 25 percent tariff on U.S.-produced autos in response to an initial round of U.S. tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. That brought Beijing’s total tariff rate on U.S. autos to 40 percent, hitting growing U.S. exports of luxury cars and sport-utility vehicles, including those from BMW (BMWG.DE), Ford Motor Co (F.N), Mercedes (DAIGn.DE) and Tesla (TSLA.O). Daimler shares closed 2.7 percent higher, while BMW shares rose 1.8 percent. GM (GM.N) shares were up 1.4 percent in late U.S. trading, while Ford rose 0.5 percent and Tesla rose 1 percent. The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the issue, said Liu planned to go to Washington after the new year. U.S. Trade Representative officials have declined to comment on plans for any new U.S.-China trade meetings.  The Harvard-educated Liu, Xi’s top economic adviser, is leading the talks on the Chinese side. In comments reported separately by China’s foreign ministry, the government’s top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi said, “If China and the United States are antagonistic, then there are no winners, and it will hurt the whole world.” The United States should look at China’s development in a more positive light, and constantly look to “expand the space and prospects for mutual benefit,” he told a forum. Global financial markets have been jittery about the clash over China’s huge trade surplus with the United States and Washington’s claims that Beijing is stealing intellectual property and technology.

2018-12-11,"MEXICO CITY, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s declaration of war on “neo-liberal” economics has shaken investors holding Petroleos Mexicanos bonds, fueling concern about the future of the highly-indebted state oil company he has pledged to revive. Ratings agencies and three managers spoken to by Reuters at funds that either hold Pemex paper or recently sold it said proposals floated by the government to build a new refinery and give the state a bigger role in the oil industry could put fresh strain on the company, which must pay back almost a third of its debt in the next three years. Fitch and Moody’s have in recent weeks flagged concerns about Pemex’s $106 billion of financial debt - the highest of any state oil company in Latin America. Under threat, said Shamaila Khan, director of emerging market debt at AllianceBernstein, which manages $550 billion in assets and invests in Pemex, is the company’s investment grade rating. “They are moving in that direction,” Khan said, citing the plans to build a new refinery and to make Pemex do more exploration as risks. If the rating goes, investors, including many pension and sovereign wealth funds whose mandates stipulate they must hold assets of investment grade quality, may have to dump Pemex debt, making it harder for the firm to raise capital. Pemex did not respond to request for comment for this story. The finance ministry declined to comment. The company, which also has $70 billion in pension obligations, said in its last quarterly report to end-September that its negative cashflow could affect its ability to operate and pay off debts. It acknowledged a downgrade was a possibility and said external auditors raised doubts about the ability of the company to continue as a business, citing recurrent net losses, negative working capital and negative equity. Energy Minister Rocio Nahle said Pemex had been driven into the ground by the policies of previous governments, and that it would be saved by a new administration focused on increasing output. “How do we think we will pay the debt? By increasing production,” she said in an interview with Aristegui Noticias on Tuesday, saying predecessors had sold assets but kept on increasing Pemex borrowing. Lopez Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1, is already entangled in a dispute with bondholders behind a new $13 billion Mexico City airport that the leftist said he would cancel on the grounds it was tainted by corruption. The move sent tremors through Mexican financial markets, hitting the peso and prompting warnings by ratings agency Fitch about Pemex. “I sold my last holdings in Pemex a couple of weeks ago due to the whole populistic approach he had to the airport,” said Dorthe Nielsen, an emerging market debt manager in Zurich at GAM, which manages assets worth 146 billion Swiss francs. Created in 1938 with the expropriation of foreign oil assets, Pemex became a symbol of Mexican ingenuity at the outset of a golden age of economic growth and stability that lasted into the 1970s. Corruption, mismanagement and declining output have all since taken a heavy toll on the company. Lopez Obrador, who harked back to the era known as the “Mexican Miracle” in his inaugural speech, has threatened to undo what he calls a neo-liberal 2013-14 energy overhaul that opened the oil and gas industry to private capital. Pitched by the last government as a fix for falling production, the reform also made it easier for Pemex to team up with other firms. However, output is still declining. On Sunday, Lopez Obrador announced tenders in March for the new refinery in the southern state of Tabasco. He also plans to upgrade existing refineries and expand drilling commissioned by Pemex. He did not give details of how the projects would be financed, but said government spending on Pemex would increase by $3.7 billion in the 2019 national budget, due to be presented on Dec. 15. Deputy finance minister Arturo Herrera has said Pemex would have to reassign funds if it were to pay for the new refinery. Nielsen at GAM said if Pemex did not start selling assets, balance sheet pressure would intensify. A loss of investment grade, she added, would be “a disaster.” Fitch and Standard & Poor’s rate Pemex’s foreign currency debt BBB+, while Moody’s puts it at Baa3, one notch above junk. Nymia Almeida, senior vice president for corporate ratings at Moody’s in Mexico, said support from the Mexican government was helping the “already very low rating” by six notches. “The rating would not be that great, if it weren’t for the consideration of the implicit support from the government,” she said, adding that the company owed $7-$8 billion in 2020, and another $10 billion in 2021. “On top of this, they are going to spend more money with the new investments.” The yield on Pemex’s September 2047 dollar-denominated issue has spiked more than 100 basis points since just before the July 1 election to bid at around 8.23 percent. While falling oil prices have contributed, investors say Lopez Obrador’s policies have aggravated the sell-off. Audra Stundziaite, a senior credit analyst at Hermes Investment Management, said Pemex was facing many of the same challenges as Brazil’s state-run Petroleo Brasileiro did three years ago when it lost investment grade. Nielsen said: “Unless Lopez Obrador comes up with something much more business-friendly that’s allowing the company to do joint ventures or bring in partners, there’s no bright future.” (Reporting by Stefanie Eschenbacher; additional reporting by Marianna Parraga, Ana Isabel Martinez and Michael O’Boyle Editing by Dave Graham and Rosalba O’Brien)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mexico-pemex/mexico-presidents-pemex-plans-rattle-faith-of-debt-holders-idUKL1N1YF0G2,11 Dec 2018,"Mexican President Andres

2018-12-11,"CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Environmental groups opposed to offshore drilling sued the federal government on Tuesday to prevent future seismic tests for oil and gas deposits in Atlantic waters off the U.S. East Coast.  Seismic testing, which uses air gun blasts, violates federal laws that protect marine mammals, endangered species, and national environmental policy, according the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Charleston, South Carolina, against U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and the National Marine Fisheries Service. The U.S. fisheries service in November gave initial permission to five companies to conduct seismic airgun tests beneath a vast region off the East Coast. The permits allow marine wildlife to be harassed but not killed. Conservationists say the testing, a precursor to oil drilling, can cause disorientation that leads to beachings of an endangered species, the North Atlantic right whale.  U.S. President Donald Trump is pursuing increased petroleum drilling as part of an “energy dominance” policy. A proposal to open nearly all U.S. waters to offshore drilling, announced in January, is pending. “The Trump administration has steamrolled over objections of scientists, governors and thousands of coastal communities and businesses to enable this dangerous activity,” Michael Jasny, a director and ocean noise pollution expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement. A federal marine biologist said last month that no seismic tests have been known to cause whale beachings. A spokeswoman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, an agency within the Commerce Department, declined to discuss ongoing litigation. Plaintiffs in the lawsuit also included the Southern Environmental Law Center, Sierra Club, Oceana, the Center for Biological Diversity and the North Carolina Coastal Federation.  Lawmakers from South Carolina and coastal mayors held a news conference on Tuesday in Charleston to address the issue. U.S. Representative-elect Joe Cunningham, a Democrat, said drilling threatens fishing industries, jobs, recreation and a  tourism industry worth $21 billion. “I’m here not just to say ‘no to offshore drilling’ but ‘hell no to offshore drilling,’” added Cunningham, who said  he would introduce legislation next year to reinstate a ban on U.S. offshore drilling that had been renewed by President Barack Obama. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster opposes drilling off the coast of his state. State Attorney General Alan Wilson will send a letter of opposition to Commerce Secretary Ross soon, a spokesman said by phone. More than a dozen states are seeking  exemptions from offshore drilling leases. “Oil spills don’t respect state boundaries,” Catherine Wannamaker, senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center said.  Reporting by Harriet McLeod; Editing by Bill Berkrot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-drilling-lawsuit/conservation-groups-sue-trump-administration-over-atlantic-oil-testing-idUKL1N1YG1TO,11 Dec 2018,"Environmental groups

2018-12-11,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil futures edged higher on Tuesday after paring most of their gains as stock markets turned negative on worries about a possible U.S. government shutdown. U.S. stock markets pulled back after President Donald Trump threatened to shut down the federal government over funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. [.N] “It looks like the prospect of a U.S. government shutdown is not good for any asset class. Equities reacted first, taking oil prices down with it,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York. Prices rose over $1 a barrel earlier in the session after Libya’s National Oil Company (NOC) declared a force majeure on exports from the country’s biggest oilfield, which was seized last weekend by a militia group. NOC said on Monday that the shutdown of the El Sharara oilfield would result in a production loss of 315,000 barrels per day (bpd), and an additional loss of 73,000 bpd at the El Feel oilfield.     After the strong start, Brent futures LCOc1 ended just 23 cents, or 0.4 percent, higher at $60.20 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 rose 65 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $51.65. Also adding pressure to the market, was Russia’s slower-than-expected planned cuts in production as part of an OPEC-led deal agreed last week to curb output by a joint 1.2 million bpd from January to shore up prices.             Russia said on Tuesday it planned to cut oil output by just 50,000 to 60,000 bpd in January, as it gradually builds to an agreed cut of 220,000 bpd. “Crude futures are roughly unchanged from just prior to the OPEC agreement as the market is apparently expressing concerns over an indicated slow start to Russia’s output reductions next month,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates in Chicago, said in a report.  Other analysts noted the reduction by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, like Russia, may not be deep enough to restore balance to the market especially after the U.S. government confirmed its forecast that the United States would end this year as the new top producing nation. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecast U.S. output would rise to a record 10.9 million bpd in 2018 and 12.1 million bpd in 2019. The market will get a peak at U.S. oil inventories this afternoon when the American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry group, releases a report at 4:30 p.m. EST.

2018-12-11,"KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 11 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - With its wooden walls and posters on protecting forests and fauna, Brazil’s pavilion at the U.N. climate talks in Poland offers no hint of the angst at home and abroad over mixed messages on global warming from its president-elect. But campaign promises made by Jair Bolsonaro that could weaken protection for the Amazon rainforest are a hot topic of conversation among visitors, said Caio Henrique Scarmocin, one of three hosts on the stand. At the conference, whose outcome will be key to implementing the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, scientists and environmental activists said they were laying the groundwork should calls for Bolsonaro to protect Brazil’s forests fail. Campaign statements from Bolsonaro, who takes power in January, suggested indigenous lands could be opened up to economic exploitation, including agribusiness and mining, and environmental fines eased. The ability of Ibama, Brazil’s environmental protection agency, to fine those who break environmental laws is one of the government’s best defences against the destruction of forests, stoking fears of a deforestation spike under the new government. Bolsonaro, who campaigned on a far-right platform, also pushed the Brazilian government to withdraw its offer to host next year’s U.N. climate conference. “He has a hostile approach over environmental issues,” said Paulo Barreto, a researcher with Imazon, a Brazilian institute monitoring deforestation in the Amazon. Brazil is home to about 60 percent of the Amazon rainforest, considered by many as nature’s best weapon against global warming, because trees absorb and store carbon from the air. Alfredo Sirkis, executive secretary of the Brazilian Forum on Climate Change, said he thought dialogue with the incoming government was still possible. But if environmental roll-backs proceed, there was a “contingency plan”, he told journalists. A coalition would assemble regional governments committed to respecting Brazil’s emissions reduction goals set under the Paris pact, said Sirkis. Governors in as many as seven Brazilian states, including Amazonas, Pernambuco, the Federal District, Espirito Santo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul, had already expressed interest in joining, he said. “This is for starters,” said the former congressman. A spokesman for the presidency of Brazil at the climate talks declined to comment. The plan has similarities with “We Are Still In”, a U.S. group of more than 3,500 mayors, governors and business leaders who have promised they will not retreat from the Paris deal. Last year, U.S. President Donald Trump gave notice the United States would leave the accord - although it cannot formally withdraw until 2020 - arguing it was bad for the economy. Mauricio Voivodic, executive director of WWF-Brazil, said his group had been in touch with the U.S. campaign through WWF-US, which is part of the “We Are Still In” secretariat. The American coalition has its own pavilion at the U.N. climate talks. “We are learning from ‘We Are Still In’ the importance of sub-national (governments) and companies enhancing commitments for the implementation of the Paris Agreement,” Voivodic said. But WWF-Brazil is not yet trying to emulate the model because it wants to prioritise dialogue already underway with the transition government, he added. “It could be an option, but we are not going in the direction of starting planning this,” said Voivodic. Brazil’s future environment minister told Reuters on Monday his “inclination” was not to leave the Paris Agreement, after Bolsonaro said on the campaign trail he might quit the deal, under which countries set their own targets to cut emissions. Marcio Astrini, public policy coordinator for Greenpeace Brazil, said he also looked to the United States as a vague blueprint to build a similar “resistance movement”. A Brazilian version would draw on linkages between about 150 civil society groups who worked closely over the last year to oppose Bolsonaro’s campaign, he said.

2018-12-11,"* Oil climbs with equities, Libya output drop * Sterling near 20-month lows after Brexit vote delayed (Updates with close of European markets) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Dec 11 (Reuters) - A gauge of global stock markets rose in volatile trade on Tuesday following threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to shut down the government over a funding fight, though stocks in Europe advanced on signs of a thaw in the U.S.-China trade battle. European shares closed higher, in part from a boost in auto shares, and Wall Street clawed higher after a report that China is moving to cut import tariffs on American-made cars, which market participants viewed as a sign China is ready to make concessions on trade. That report came after Chinese Vice Premier Liu He exchanged views on the next stage of trade talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. But U.S. stocks wobbled after the open and fell further after Trump openly sparred about government funding with the top two Democratic lawmakers during an Oval Office meeting, raising doubts a deal would be possible ahead of a deadline later this month. “There are a lot of people who think gridlock is a good thing because you don’t get anything done, but I think gridlock is not a good thing,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. “I guess the upshot of the bickering suggests to me that a government shutdown is not out the cards by any means and that’s probably the most negative thing to come out of it,” Tuz said. Wall Street later turned higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 58.76 points, or 0.24 percent, to 24,482.02, the S&P 500 gained 9.81 points, or 0.37 percent, to 2,647.53 and the Nasdaq Composite added 33.29 points, or 0.47 percent, to 7,053.81. Germany’s DAX, which entered bear market territory last week and is Europe’s most China-sensitive market, climbed 1.5 percent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.53 percent, and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.35 percent, on track for a sixth straght decline. The uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the European Union, or Brexit, continued to haunt investors and held sterling near 20-month lows after British Prime Minister Theresa May postponed a vote on her deal. On Tuesday, German leader Angela Merkel ruled out further Brexit negotiations but said efforts were being made to give Britain reassurances. A spokesman for May said Britain’s parliament will vote on whether to approve her Brexit deal before Jan. 21. Sterling was last trading at $1.2527, down 0.25 percent after hitting a low of 1.249. After an initial softening, the dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against six major peers, rose 0.22 percent, with the euro down 0.33 percent to $1.1318. European bond markets were focused on France a day after President Emmanuel Macron announced wage rises for the poorest workers and tax cuts for pensioners, in further government concessions aimed at defusing weeks of often-violent protests, raising concerns over fiscal spending. In response, French bond yields rose to their highest spread in 20 months over Germany’s yields, at 47.81 basis points. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.879 percent, from 2.856 percent late on Monday. Oil prices rebounded after having sunk on Monday, buoyed by an outage that dented Libyan production. U.S. crude rose 1.27 percent to $51.65 per barrel, and Brent was last at $60.20, up 0.38 percent.

2018-12-11,"(Adds Energy Transfer comment) By Stephanie Kelly Dec 11 (Reuters) - A Pennsylvania administrative law judge on Tuesday denied a petition by state residents asking utility regulators to prohibit the operation of Energy Transfer LP and its Sunoco subsidiary’s Mariner East pipelines. The petition filed in November sought interim emergency relief, citing risks from the pipelines in the area and urging the state’s Public Utility Commission to direct Sunoco to stop operation of its Mariner East 1 pipeline and prohibit operation of its Mariner East 2 pipeline. The residents alleged that the company did “not provide adequate notice of procedures sufficient to ensure the safety of the public in the event of a leak or rupture,” according to the petition. Judge Elizabeth Barnes ruled that the petitioners presented no evidence of the risk of death from an accidental pipeline leak, and failed to demonstrate a need for immediate relief. “We are pleased with the judge’s ruling,” Energy Transfer spokeswoman Lisa Dillinger said in an emailed statement, adding that the company expects Mariner East 2 to be put into service by the end of the year. Mariner East transports liquids from the Marcellus and Utica shale fields in western Pennsylvania to customers in the state and elsewhere, including international exports from Energy Transfer’s Marcus Hook complex near Philadelphia. Mariner East 2 and another Energy Transfer project, the Rover natural gas pipe from Ohio to Michigan, were delayed over the past year in part because the projects together racked up more than 800 state and federal permit violations while the company raced to build them.

2018-12-11,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq will send a delegation to the United States seeking an exemption from sanctions against Iran that would allow it to keep importing Iranian gas, Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said on Tuesday. Washington gave Iraq a 45-day waiver for imports of gas from Iran when it reimposed sanctions on Iran’s oil sector on Nov. 5. Iraqi officials have said they need around two years to find an alternative source. “The American side is cooperating with Iraq to find solutions that would remove pressure on Iraq because the (Iranian) gas is linked to a very sensitive issue which is electricity,” Abdul Mahdi told a news conference. Washington is seeking to roll back Iranian influence in the Middle East, including in Iraq, where Iran holds broad sway over politics and trade. Abdul Mahdi, who assumed office in October after six months of political uncertainty following an inconclusive election, on Tuesday met U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Baghdad. “Sanctions were mentioned, they’re a reality, they’re there,” Perry told reporters in Baghdad, after meeting Iraq’s oil and electricity ministers. Abdul Mahdi’s office said Perry was in Baghdad with a delegation of over 50 business people. Perry spoke at a conference organised by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which Oil Minister Thamer Ghadhban also attended, and said they had “talked about some very positive opportunities”. Iraq has reached a deal with U.S. energy giant General Electric and German rival Siemens to install liquefied natural gas-operated mobile power units at some small southern oil fields, Iraq’s state newspaper reported last month. The Financial Times reported in October that the U.S. government had intervened in favour of GE for a contract sought by both companies to supply 11 gigawatts of power generation equipment, reportedly worth around $15 billion.

2018-12-11,"(Adds milestones, demand forecast, background) NEW YORK, Dec 11 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil output growth was expected to slow slightly for this year compared with previous forecasts, the Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday, but at a record 10.88 million barrels per day, the nation will end 2018 as the world’s top producer. Output this year was forecast to rise 1.53 million bpd to 10.88 million bpd, down from the EIA’s previous estimate of an increase of 1.55 million bpd. The current all-time U.S. annual output peak was in 1970 at 9.6 million bpd, according to federal energy data. For 2019, U.S. crude oil production was expected to average 12.06 million bpd, the EIA said, up 1.18 million bpd from the prior year which is a small upward revision from the previous forecast of a 1.16-million bpd rise. A shale revolution has helped the United States produce a record amount of oil this year and topple Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world’s biggest producer. “The United States will conclude 2018 as the world’s largest producer of crude oil,” said EIA Administrator Dr. Linda Capuano. “EIA’s December short-term outlook largely attributes the recent decline in Brent crude oil spot prices, which averaged $65 per barrel in November, to record production among the world’s largest crude oil producers and concerns about weaker global oil demand.” Oil prices  have crashed more than 30 percent from their near four-year highs in early October as worries about a glut gripped the market. In 2019, oil demand is estimated to rise by 330,000 bpd to 20.81 million bpd, up from its previous estimate of a rise of 220,000 bpd. For 2018, U.S. oil demand is expected to rise by 520,000 bpd to 20.48 million bpd, EIA said, slightly raising its previous forecast of a 510,000 bpd rise to 20.47 million bpd.

2018-12-11,"(Recasts, adds details, price reaction, analyst quotes) By Mark Weinraub CHICAGO, Dec 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Agriculture Department on Tuesday left its estimate for domestic soybean supplies unchanged but boosted its outlook for world stocks amid rising expectations for the South American crop. U.S. soybean ending stocks for the 2018/19 marketing year were pegged at 955 million bushels, the government said in its monthly supply and demand report. USDA had boosted its soybean ending stocks view in its five previous monthly reports. Analysts had expected the government to show ending stocks of 945 million bushels, according to the average of estimates in a Reuters poll. If realized, soybean stocks would hit a record high as U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war with China has sharply cut in to demand for U.S. supplies from the world’s biggest buyer of the oilseed. USDA left its soybean export outlook unchanged at 1.9 billion bushels this month. “Every month they don’t lower soybean exports is a good month for beans,” said Jim Gerlach, president of A/C Trading. “When you’re running this far behind the pace that you need and you don’t lower it, that’s telling you that they see exports coming from somewhere some time.” USDA also left its forecast for Chinese soybean imports unchanged at 90 million tonnes. But it raised its outlook for world soybean supplies to 115.33 million tonnes from 112.08 million tonnes, topping analysts’ expectations for 112.79 million tonnes. The government boosted its forecast for Brazil’s soybean crop by 1.5 million tonnes to 122 million tonnes. “That’s a big number (global soybean ending stocks) and likely to go higher if we don’t see a sale to China,” said Mike Zuzolo of Global Commodity Analytics. “The market is in a bit of a holding pattern, waiting for a sale.” Soybean futures, which had been trading close to unchanged before the report was released, firmed as investors digested the data. But the market remained cautious as traders waited for clear signs of a pick-up in Chinese purchases. U.S. corn stocks for 2018/19 were pegged at 1.781 billion bushels, up from the November forecast for 1.736 billion bushels. The government lowered its estimate of corn used for ethanol production by 50 million bushels. USDA forecast wheat ending stocks of 974 million bushels, up from its November outlook for 949 million bushels due to a cut of 25 million bushels in its U.S. export forecast. Wheat futures sank to session lows before finding technical support.

2018-12-11,"(Adds details) DAR ES SALAAM, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Tanzania will sign a deal this week for the construction of a  $3 billion hydroelectric power plant, the president said in remarks broadcast on state television on Tuesday. President John Magufuli did not name the company awarded the contract for the power plant and dam to be built in the Selous Game Reserve, a U.N.-designated world heritage site in southern Tanzania. Government sources told Reuters the contract would be signed with Egypt’s Arab Contractors. Magufuli said the East African country was moving ahead with the project due to improved revenue collection by the government, without giving details. The 2,100 MW project would more than double the country’s power generation capacity. But the project’s location is in a World Heritage site and has faced opposition from conservationists. They have said the construction of a dam on a major river that runs through the Selous Game Reserve could affect wildlife and their habitats downstream. The government invited bids in August last year for the project at Stiegler’s Gorge which is in the Selous Game Reserve. Egypt’s El Sewedy Electric Co has said it will also participate in the construction of the dam. Arab Contractors will have a 55 percent stake in the project and El Sewedy 45 percent, Ahmed Hassouna, El Sewedy’s head of marketing, said on Tuesday. Covering 50,000 square km, the Selous Game Reserve is one of the largest protected areas in Africa, according to UNESCO. It is known for its elephants, black rhinos and giraffes, among many other species. The World Wildlife Fund conservation group said in a report in July last year the proposed large-scale hydropower dam “puts protected areas of global importance, as well as the livelihoods of over 200,000 people who depend upon the environment, at risk.” “The impact on Tanzania’s largest river would affect many ecosystem services it provides. It would affect tourism in Selous downstream in some of the most abundant wildlife areas in the game reserve,” it said.

2018-12-11,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Talks billed as the most important U.N. conference since the Paris 2015 deal on climate change are in their crucial final week in Katowice, capital of Poland’s Silesian coal mining district.  The aim is to meet an end-of-year deadline for agreeing a rule book on how to enforce action to limit further warming of the planet. Subscribers to Eikon can also find a Take-A-Look summary of Reuters coverage here: Below is a flavor of the mood around the event, held in a sprawl of temporary passageways and meeting rooms next to the “Spodek”, a flying-saucer-shaped sports and concert venue built on the site of the former Katowice coal mine. Ministers and heads of state from around 134 countries started to give opening speeches. At the end of his, Maldives’ environment minister Hussain Hassan asked fellow ministers at the plenary to stand. “There is no time to lose. Stand for a few moments and think about what will happen if we fail to save the planet now,” he said.  Brexit turmoil and French riots have kept many government chiefs away from the final and crucial week, with only four national leaders present as of Tuesday. Negotiating teams have been asked to produce a more concise draft text on the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement today. The draft is not yet available. Germany’s environment minister Svenja Schulze said the importance of the small print cannot be over-estimated and will enable countries’ actions to be made transparent.  Mohamed Adow of Christian Aid said: “Delivering a successful outcome in Katowice is like solving a three-dimensional jigsaw. It has three parts, the Paris rulebook, finance for poor countries and renewed emissions reductions. “Like an African stool, it doesn’t work if one of the legs is missing,” he added. In a central zone of the sprawling venue, countries have “pavilions” where they showcase their low-carbon efforts.  The Polish pavilion has been described as “provocative” by some environmentalists because one side has cages of coal on the wall with the slogan “black to green transformation” - implying coal can be used in a way that significantly reduces its carbon emissions. Qatar is usually in the lavish Gulf Cooperation Council pavilion but has its own, smaller one this year. The country is in a diplomatic rift with other members and its leader boycotted a GCC summit on Sunday. Last week, Qatar said it would quit OPEC to focus on gas, in a swipe at Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the oil exporting group which is trying to show unity in tackling an oil price slide.

The latest December output projection for 2018 was up from EIA’s 83.23-bcfd forecast in November. EIA also projected U.S. gas consumption would rise to an all-time high of 81.74 bcfd in 2018 from 74.32 bcfd in 2017. That 2018 demand projection in the December STEO report was up from EIA’s 81.11-bcfd forecast for the year in its November report and would top the current annual record high of 74.98 bcfd consumed on average in 2016. EIA projected output in 2019 would rise to 89.99 bcfd but usage would ease to 81.57 bcfd. It forecast U.S. net gas exports would rise to 2.1 bcfd in 2018 and 6.2 bcfd in 2019, from 0.4 bcfd in 2017. In 2017, the United States became a net gas exporter for the first time in 60 years. In electrical generation, EIA projected gas would remain the primary U.S. power plant fuel in 2018 and 2019 after first supplanting coal in 2016. EIA projected the share of gas generation would rise to 35 percent in 2018 and 2019 from 32 percent in 2017. Coal’s share of generation was forecast to slide to 28 percent in 2018 and 26 percent in 2019 from 30 percent in 2017. EIA projected the electric power sector would burn 644.4 million short tons of coal in 2018, which would be the lowest in 34 years, and 599.7 million short tons in 2019, the lowest since 1982. That compares with 665.0 million short tons in 2017, which was the lowest since 1984. U.S. carbon emissions have dropped as the power sector has been burning less coal. After U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide emissions declined to 5,144 million tonnes in 2017, the least since 1992, EIA projected they would rise to 5,299 million tonnes in 2018 due to higher gas consumption during a colder winter and a warmer summer than in 2017. In 2019, carbon emissions are expected to slide to 5,234 million tonnes due to changes in weather, economic growth and energy prices.

A report that China is moving to cut import tariffs on American-made cars pushed European stocks higher as auto stocks jumped and the market interpreted this as a sign China is ready to make concessions on trade. Shares of U.S. automaker General Motors jumped 3.5 percent while Ford Motor climbed 1.4 percent. That report came after China’s Vice Premier Liu He exchanged views on the next stage of trade talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. Signs of progress in the trade talks helped Wall Street build on Monday’s gains, when major U.S. indexes staged a reversal from an early tumble which saw the benchmark S&P 500 hit its lowest level since April. Ten of 11 major S&P sectors were higher on Tuesday, with only the defensive utilities sector in the red. “This is a garden variety oversold bounce driven by headlines on China tariffs,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 45.79 points, or 0.19 percent, to 24,469.05, the S&P 500 gained 11.21 points, or 0.42 percent, to 2,648.93 and the Nasdaq Composite added 47.79 points, or 0.68 percent, to 7,068.31. Germany’s DAX, the most China-sensitive market in Europe which entered bear market territory last week, climbed 1.9 percent. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.46 percent and was poised to snap a five-session losing streak which saw the index drop 5.5 percent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.81 percent. Britain’s exit from the European Union, or Brexit, remained an uncertainty for investors, and held sterling near 20-month lows after British Prime Minister Theresa May postponed a vote on her deal. On Tuesday, German leader Angela Merkel ruled out further Brexit negotiations but said efforts were being made to give Britain reassurances. A spokesman for May said Britain’s parliament will vote on whether to approve Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal before Jan. 21. Sterling was last trading at $1.2518, down 0.33 percent on the day after hitting a low of 1.25. After an initial softening, the dollar index, tracking the U.S. currency against six major peers, rose 0.24 percent, with the euro down 0.33 percent to $1.1317. European bond markets were focused on France as President Emmanuel Macron announced wage rises for the poorest workers and tax cuts for pensioners, raising concerns over fiscal spending after the government announced concessions aimed at defusing weeks of often-violent protests.

2018-12-11,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Brexit turmoil and French riots have kept many government chiefs away from the final and crucial week of U.N. climate talks, with only four national leaders present on Tuesday.  Some 190 countries are meeting in Katowice, Poland to agree a “rule book” on implementing the Paris climate deal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in what has been billed as the most important U.N. conference since that pact was agreed in 2015.     Back then, former U.S. President Barack Obama, Chinese President Xi Jinping and India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi  attended the talks that ended with a sense of global unity to confront climate change that scientists say will have devastating consequences if emissions are not curbed. Out of around 134 national representatives delivering speeches over the next two days, only four are heads of government: the president of Kiribati and the prime ministers of Samoa, the Cook Islands and Tuvalu - nations among the most vulnerable to climate change. “Kiribati is among the low-lying islands which has been brutally battered by climate change over the past two decades,” said President Taneti Maamau. “We all need to act now and fast but I stress it requires strong political will by us leaders ... climate change is everyone’s business.” Expectations for the talks are low: political unity built in Paris has been shattered by populist governments that have placed national agendas before collective action. Last year, at talks in Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron urged more global action to combat global warming after U.S. President Donald Trump decided to pull out of the Paris pact. France was initially expected to be represented in Katowice by Prime Minister Edouard Philippe but he had to cancel after a weekend of violent protests in Paris. Germany’s Merkel was busy meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday about Britain’s floundering Brexit deal. Britain’s minister for business, energy and industrial strategy, Claire Perry, is expected to arrive in Katowice on Thursday. “What matters most is the ministers who are here this week have the necessary political mandate to make the big decisions we need,” said Jens Mattias Clausen of Greenpeace International. “Talks here in Katowice urgently need to speed up to achieve a strong rulebook and a commitment to raise ambition. The Polish presidency has a critical role in driving this process forward.” Additional reporting by Bate Felix; Editing by Robin Pomeroy",https://uk.reuters.com/article/climate-change-accord/ministers-but-few-leaders-arrive-for-crucial-part-of-climate-talks-idUKL8N1YG2V6,11 Dec 2018,"Brexit turmoil and

2018-12-11,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration proposed on Tuesday reducing federal protections for U.S. waterways, an action sought by ranching and mining interests but one that will likely be held up in the courts amid lawsuits brought by environmentalists.  The Environmental Protection Agency proposal would narrow the extent of protections in the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule that President Barack Obama’s administration expanded in 2015 to cover a wide range of water bodies. President Donald Trump, who has accused Obama of over-reaching on regulations, made rolling back WOTUS one of his top policy priorities. Tuesday’s proposal was his administration’s latest effort to rescind environmental rules to boost the energy and agriculture industries.  Andrew Wheeler, the acting EPA administrator, said the proposal would cut costs for farmers and miners.  The proposed new definition of U.S. waters “puts an end to the previous administration’s power grab,” Wheeler said after signing the proposal at EPA headquarters. Land owners should be able to determine whether water on their property should be protected “without having to hire outside professionals,” Wheeler said.  The 2015 changes defined which streams and wetlands are protected by federal clean water law from pollutants including pesticides, fertilizers and mine waste.  Mark Ryan, a lawyer at Ryan & Kuehler PLLC who spent 24 years as a clean water expert and litigator at the EPA, said water systems called headwaters in high regions of the country could lose protections under the new definitions being proposed by the Trump administration.   “I think the mining industry is going to benefit from this because mines tend to be up in the mountains near headwater systems,” Ryan said. Miners may no longer need to apply for a permit before pushing waste, such as rubble from mountain-top coal mining in the eastern United States, into some streams. Ephemeral streams that make up a large percentage of the total river miles in the United States could lose protections, as could what the EPA calls “isolated wetlands.”    The proposal will undergo a 60-day comment period before the EPA moves to finalize it. Wheeler said the proposal would withstand lawsuits because the EPA closely examined court cases in writing it.  Ryan said finalization may not happen soon, if ever. “I don’t think this rule is ever going to see the light of day,” he said. “This is going to be tied up in litigation for at least two years and if Trump doesn’t get re-elected (in 2020), then it’s dead,” he added.

2018-12-11,"(Reuters) - The Arctic had its second-hottest year on record in 2018, part of a warming trend that may be dramatically changing earth’s weather patterns, according to a report released on Tuesday by the U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. “Arctic air temperatures for the past five years have exceeded all previous records since 1900,” according to the annual NOAA study, the 2018 Arctic Report Card, which said the year was second only to 2016 in overall warmth in the region. It marks the latest in a series of warnings about climate change from U.S. government bodies, even as President Donald Trump has voiced scepticism about the phenomenon and has pushed a pro-fossil fuels agenda. The study said the Arctic warming continues at about double the rate of the rest of the planet, and that the trend appears to be altering the shape and strength of the jet stream air current that influences weather in the Northern Hemisphere. “Growing atmospheric warmth in the Arctic results in a sluggish and unusually wavy jet-stream that coincided with abnormal weather events,” it said, noting that the changing patterns have often brought unusually frigid temperatures to areas south of the Arctic Circle. Some examples are “a swarm of severe winter storms in the eastern United States in 2018, and the extreme cold outbreak in Europe in March 2018 known as ‘the Beast from the East.’” Environmentalists have long warned of rapid warming in the Arctic, saying it threatens imperilled species like polar bears, and is a harbinger of the broader impacts of climate change on the planet.  Scientists have warned that the region could suffer trillions of dollars worth of climate change-related damage to infrastructure in the coming decades. But the melting of Arctic ice has piqued the interests of polar nations like the United States, Canada and Russia by opening new shipping routes and expanding access to a region believed to be rich in petroleum and minerals. The United States and Russia have both expressed an interest in boosting Arctic drilling, and Russia has bolstered its military presence in the north. The NOAA report comes weeks after more than a dozen U.S. government agencies released a study concluding that climate change is driven by human consumption of fossil fuels and will cost the U.S. economy hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century. Trump, who has been rolling back Obama-era environmental and climate protections to maximize production of domestic fossil fuels, said of the update to the National Climate Assessment: “I don’t believe it.” Trump last year announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris Deal agreed by nearly 200 nations to combat climate change, arguing the accord would kill jobs and provide little tangible environmental benefit.

2018-12-11,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Deforestation in Brazil’s tropical Cerrado savanna, which makes up a quarter of the country, fell 11 percent to a record low in 2018 compared with a year earlier, the Ministry of Environment said in a statement on Tuesday. Deforestation in the South American country’s savanna biome totaled 6,657 square kilometers (2,570 square miles), an area larger than the U.S. state of Connecticut. That’s just below 6,777 square kilometers in 2016, the previous low since records began to be kept, the ministry said.  A biome is a grouping of plants and animals that have adapted to a specific environment. This contrasts with the Amazon rainforest, making up 40 percent of Brazil, which has seen a 13.7 percent spike in deforestation this year to a 10-year high. Activists have been concerned that deforestation could spike under policies proposed by President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, who assumes office Jan. 1 and has pledged to end the current “industry of fines” for environmental violations like deforestation.     The figure for Cerrado is based on the change in deforestation between August 2017 and July 2018, the period used to measure annual destruction, as recorded by Brazilian space research agency Inpe. The statement did not give a reason for the decline in deforestation. The Cerrado’s vegetation soaks up major amounts of carbon dioxide, making its preservation key to curbing greenhouse gas emissions and for countering global warming.  While the Cerrado is less densely forested than the Amazon rainforest, its plants have deep roots that lock carbon into the ground and are sometimes referred to as an underground forest. Ricardo Salles, Brazil’s future environment minister under Bolsonaro, told Reuters on Monday that Bolsonaro would not gut resources for environmental protection, contrary to the fears of environmentalists.  Money for environmental protection is spent inefficiently and mismanaged, he said, arguing he could produce better results with the same budget.

2018-12-11,"LISBON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - A search for hydrocarbons in Portugal’s onshore Lusitanian basin could reveal enough natural gas to supply the whole country for two-and-a-half years, according to the boss of Australis Oil & Gas, which has exclusive rights to two concessions in the area. “Portugal is relatively under-explored but there is a relatively high success rate,” Chief Executive Ian Lusted told Reuters. “But to date there have been no sizeable findings and there is no hydrocarbon production at all in the country.” According to the company, which won an eight-year- exploration licence in 2015, a total of 148 onshore wells have been drilled in the country so far, with the majority being shallow wells of less than 500 metres. However, from the wells already drilled in Batalha and Pombal in central Portugal - the two concessions owned by the company - there are indications of two working hydrocarbon systems. “We had independent engineers who assessed that the recoverable volume was about two-and-a-half years of supply for the whole of Portugal,” Lusted said. Portugal’s natural gas consumption was estimated at 6.15 billion cubic meters (217.2 billion cu ft) in 2017. “This is potentially very beneficial for the country and it ties up with government policy,” Lusted added. The government said early in December it was aiming for renewable energy sources to account for 80 percent of Portugal’s energy by 2030, rising to 100 percent in 2050. Environmentalists have expressed concerns about the natural gas project, even though it is a cleaner energy source than oil and could be used in a transition period as the country turns to renewables. The drilling in the two areas could start in early 2020 but it still has to be assessed by environmental authorities. Environmentalists also fear the Australian company could use an extraction process known as fracking, which has been criticised in some countries for disrupting local communities. Lusted denied this, saying the company would only be allowed to “drill a well and produce it conventionally”. In a petition signed by more than 5,000 people, local non-governmental organisation ASMAA wrote that “the concessions where Australis will drill include areas of high population density, and many areas of cultural and historical interest, as well as many nature reserves”.

2018-12-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - British shale gas company Cuadrilla has again paused fracking at its Preston New Road site in Lancashire, northwest England, after tremors were detected, the company said. This marks the third time operations have been halted at the site following seismic activity under Britain’s so-called traffic light regulation system, since they began in October.  “A series of micro seismic events in Blackpool have been recorded on the British Geological Survey website this morning following hydraulic fracturing at our shale gas exploration site in Preston New Road, Lancashire,” Cuadrilla said in a statement. The largest tremor, of 1.5 magnitude, took place after fracking activities had already stopped, it said. “According to recent research by the University of Liverpool the impact would be like dropping a melon,” Cuadrilla said. Fracking, or hydraulically fracturing, involves extracting gas from rocks by breaking them up with water and chemicals at high pressure. It is opposed by environmentalists who say extracting more fossil fuel is at odds with Britain’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the government is keen to reduce the country’s reliance on imports of natural gas, which is used to heat around 80 percent of Britain’s homes. The company, which is 47.4 percent owned by Australia’s AJ Lucas (AJL.AX) and 45.2 percent owned by a fund managed by Riverstone, first attempted to frack gas near the coastal town of Blackpool in northwestern England in 2011, but the practice led to a 2.3 magnitude earth tremor. It said then that the quakes at that site were caused by an unusual combination of geological features, but they led to an 18-month nationwide ban on fracking while further research was carried out. The government has since introduced a traffic-light system that immediately suspends work if seismic activity of magnitude 0.5 or above is detected. “Cuadrilla will pause and continue to monitor micro seismicity for at least the next 18 hours... Well integrity has been checked and verified,” it said. Cuadrilla said last month it had extracted its first shale gas from the site. Gas flows were small but coming at such an early stage of the project were evidence of the site’s potential, it said.

2018-12-11,"(Adds detail, quotes, comments from Russian foreign ministry) By Katya Golubkova SABETTA, Russia, Dec 11 (Reuters) - French oil and gas group Total believes there is enough demand on the spot market for liquefied natural gas from its Yamal LNG plant in Russia, Total’s chief executive said on Tuesday, as the project has expanded ahead of schedule. On Tuesday, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev attended a ceremony marking the launch of the third train, or stage, of Yamal LNG, which expanded its annual capacity to 16.5 million tonnes. The expansion had been initially expected at the end of 2019 and a quicker rise in output has raised questions about Yamal LNG’s ability to sell the additional volumes. It has pre-sold more than 96 percent of its LNG production under long-term contracts for the next 20 years. Russian gas producer Novatek controls Yamal LNG, which is co-invested by Total, China’s CNPC and the Silk Road Fund. It started operations in December 2017. Total’s Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said Yamal LNG would start sales under a long-term contract from the third stage of the Yamal LNG project as initially planned. “It is not difficult to sell on the spot market, the LNG market is growing by 10 pct per year or more, so clients are asking for more LNG, it’s not a real issue,” Pouyanne told reporters. “We export more LNG quicker, its good for the project. In fact, it is a surprise, but the (LNG) trains are ready in front of all the vessels,” he said. Last month, an LNG tanker transferred a cargo of Yamal LNG to another vessel off the tip of northern Norway, the first such operation that will help the facility raise production. This has irked the United States, who has said the operations undercut Europe’s energy diversification efforts. By transferring LNG to more conventional tankers in Norway, the Arctic vessels cut in half the distance they would cover to deliver gas to Europe, enabling more frequent shipments from the Novatek terminal and increasing Russia’s gas exports. Russia’s foreign ministry, in emailed comments to Reuters, said the operation’s aim is to reduce transportation costs, calling criticism from the United States “unfair” and “political pressure”.

2018-12-11,"PARIS (Reuters) - Total invited environmental activists on Tuesday to visit a planned offshore drilling site in French Guyana and said the project would not endanger coral reefs in the region. The firm said it was ready to start exploration around 150 km (93 miles) off French Guyana’s coast after the arrival on site of a drilling ship. The vessel has been given clearance by French authorities to move into the area. “Conscious of the questions that this campaign could raise, Total wishes to highlight that it is a responsible company that conducts operations while constantly seeking to minimize the environmental risk and is determined to act with transparency,” it said. The company said drilling would take place about 30 km (19 miles) from the closest reef and in an area without coral. Activists say delicate coral reefs discovered in the area risked being damaged by the drilling operations. Total’s invitation the French Guyana site comes days after Brazil’s environment agency Ibama rejected the energy major’s application to drill in five blocks that lie in the Foz do Amazonas Basin near the Amazon rainforest region. Ibama has now rejected Total’s application five times. It said this rejection was the final one in the regulation process. The French Guyana project and the Amazon basin drilling plan have drawn fierce criticism from Greenpeace and other non-governmental organizations (NGOs). “The company will analyze the documents received from Ibama and decide on further steps,” Total said of the Brazil project.

A report China is moving to cut import tariffs on American-made cars drove European stocks to extend gains strongly as auto stocks jumped and the market interpreted this as a sign China is ready to make concessions on trade. The report came after China’s Vice Premier Liu He exchanged views on the next stage of trade talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. S&P 500 and Dow futures were up 0.8 to 1 percent, indicating a strong open on Wall Street. Euro zone stocks rose 1.8 percent and Germany’s DAX climbed 2 percent while Britain’s FTSE 100 rose 1.6 percent. Germany’s DAX, the most China-sensitive market in Europe, last week entered bear market territory. MSCI’s world equity index gained 0.4 percent - set for its first day of gains after a five-day losing streak. China’s blue-chip index had risen 0.5 percent overnight. Sterling, meanwhile, still floundered near 20-month lows as the market sought clarity on the next steps for Brexit after Britain’s prime minister postponed a vote on her deal. Sterling hesitantly rose 0.4 percent to $1.2610 as traders sought to price in a range of possibilities after Prime Minister Theresa May’s abrupt decision to postpone a parliamentary vote on her Brexit agreement on Monday, a move that sent the pound spiralling down to $1.2505. Goldman Sachs analysts said volatility across UK assets has increased, with option markets pricing a wider range of outcomes including Brexit without a deal, a last-minute agreement or another referendum on EU membership. “We still think a no deal is a very low probability, but the uncertainty will persist for some time,” said Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at Blackrock. “The events of the last few days show you why there’s caution,” he added. May embarked on the first leg of a trip to meet European leaders on Tuesday, seeking support for changes to her Brexit deal, while at home some lawmakers agitated for a vote of no confidence. The EU was adamant the withdrawal agreement, including its most contentious element - a “backstop” for the Northern Ireland frontier - could not be renegotiated. “I have no doubt a no-deal Brexit would rank pretty high on the list of market accidents ... and have a global impact,” said Andreas Utermann, CEO of Allianz Global Investors. Bond markets were focused on France as investors fretted over fiscal spending after the government announced concessions aimed at defusing weeks of often violent protests. President Emmanuel Macron announced wage rises for the poorest workers and tax cuts for pensioners. This sent French bond yields to their highest level over Germany’s in 19 months, with the spread over the safe-haven German Bund hitting 48.5 basis points. Macron’s announcement “leaves open the question about how the new fiscal measures will be covered financially,” wrote UniCredit analysts. Olivier Dussopt, junior minister for public accounts, said on BFM TV the measures would cost 8-10 billion euros ($9.1-$11.4 billion). The dollar index, which measures the U.S. dollar against a basket of major currencies, slipped 0.3 percent to 97.078 . In emerging markets, stocks rose 0.4 percent from one-month lows hit on Monday. The shock resignation of India’s central bank governor hurt India’s NSE share index initially, but it closed up 0.6 percent, helped by election results in three states which were not as poor for the ruling party as some had expected. Oil prices rebounded strongly from earlier losses, having sunk on Monday. U.S. crude futures climbed 1.2 percent to $51.61 and Brent futures rose 0.8 percent to $60.47. Growth worries still stalked markets. Japan’s economy provided the latest negative data point, contracting the most in over four years in the third quarter. Disappointing economic data has fanned worries about corporate earnings and factory output, with the Sino-U.S. trade battle clouding the outlook for growth. All sectors in Europe are in the red this year after oil became the last to give up all its 2018 gains, as investors licked their wounds and awaited the end of a bruising year.

2018-12-11,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Average world temperatures are on course to far exceed the main goal set in the 2015 Paris Agreement on limiting global warming, a study showed on Tuesday. But the overshoot by the end of this century could be less severe than expected thanks to significant efforts by some countries to combat climate change, said the report by Climate Action Tracker (CAT), a consortium of three independent European research groups. The Paris Agreement aims to restrict warming to “well below” two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. Countries are meeting in Poland from Dec. 2-14 to agree guidelines for implementing the pact which comes into force in 2020 but there are concerns these will be too weak to limit temperature rise to within safe levels. The CAT report said there had been progress since 2015, but current policies meant the world was heading for warming of 3.3C. That compared with the 3.4C it predicted a year ago, and it said that if governments were to implement policies they had in the pipeline, warming by 2100 could be limited to 3C. Even a rise of 3C could cause loss of tropical coral reefs, Alpine glaciers, Arctic summer sea ice and perhaps an irreversible melt of Greenland’s ice which would drive up world sea levels, a United Nations science panel has said. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said in October that keeping the rise to 1.5C was possible but would require rapid and unprecedented changes in human behavior. “We have yet to see this translate into action in terms of what governments are prepared to put on the table,” said Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, one of the three CAT research groups. Since the Paris accord was agreed, countries including Argentina, Canada, Chile and India plus the European Union are moving in the right direction toward cutting emissions. Countries such as Norway and Costa Rica are making progress with low-carbon transport and renewable energy deployment but China’s carbon emissions rose again this year, the report said. “With prices for renewables dropping roughly a third since Paris, both South Africa and Chile are mapping out strategies to address coal, and renewables are taking off in India,” said Niklas Höhne of research group NewClimate Institute. But countries including the United States, Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Russia and the United Arab Emirates have made either no progress or taken backward steps.

2018-12-11,"(Repeats item published earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China's trade and economy: tmsnrt.rs/2iO9Q6a By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Dec 11 (Reuters) - The prevailing market narrative after China’s overall November trade data was that the world’s second-biggest economy is softening and starting to show the strains of the trade dispute with the United States. After all, both imports and exports undershot forecasts for the month. But while there is nothing inherently incorrect in such commentary, one factor that may not be getting as much attention as it should - the lower-than-anticipated growth in imports may be largely related to weaker commodity prices. China’s exports rose 5.4 percent in November from a year earlier, well short of the 10 percent forecast in a Reuters poll. Imports grew a sluggish 3 percent, considerably weaker than the 14.5 percent forecast. The export weakness was largely put down to the end of front-loading of shipments to the United States ahead of the now postponed higher tariffs of 25 percent on $200 billion of imports from China that had been mooted by President Donald Trump. The import weakness was largely ascribed to slacker domestic demand. While this may be the situation for manufactured goods and services, it doesn’t appear to be the case for commodities. The problem with simply looking at the trade numbers is that they are expressed in U.S. dollar terms, and not in volume terms. Case in point - crude oil, where China is the world’s biggest importer. China imported a record 10.43 million barrels per day (bpd), the first time inbound shipments had topped the 10 million bpd mark, and well above the 9.6 million bpd recorded in October. Working out exactly how much China paid for its oil in November is challenging, but it’s likely to be less than it paid in October, despite the extra 15.1 million barrels imported. Exhibit A: Brent crude hit a four-year high of $86.74 a barrel on Oct. 3 and has since slumped 27 percent to its close of $59.97 on Monday. This means that at the time Chinese refiners were fixing cargoes for November delivery, prices were declining, encouraging volume growth. Of course, there are other factors at work: The start-up of new refineries and their associated inventory buying, increased purchases by smaller, independent refiners aiming to use up their import quotas before they expire, and uncertainty over when exactly imports of Iranian oil cleared customs. But the overall picture isn’t one of weakness for China’s crude oil imports, which are now up 8.4 percent for the first 11 months of the year, compared to the same period in 2017. While copper imports were weaker in November compared to the same month a year earlier, they were also up strongly from October, with unwrought copper jumping 8.6 percent on-month and ores and concentrates up 8.9 percent. Three-month London copper prices peaked in early June and have subsequently dropped about 17 percent. That means Chinese buyers would have been paying substantially less for their imports in November than in prior months. Iron ore and coal present more interesting reading. Imports of both fell in November from October, despite weaker prices. Iron ore imports slipped 2.4 percent to 86.25 million tonnes, while coal purchases from overseas dropped 17 percent to 19.15 million tonnes. But the weakness in these imports is almost entirely policy driven. In other words, it’s the deliberate choice of Beijing to import less, rather than a sign of domestic economic weakness. The authorities have made it clear they didn’t want coal imports in 2018 to exceed those of 2017 in order to protect the local mining industry. While they will fail in this endeavour, as the first 11 months of 2018 has seen imports reach the total for 2017, it does mean that November and December coal imports will be well below potential. Iron ore is struggling along with steel as winter production curbs aimed at lowering air pollution start to have an impact on the market. Overall, the volume of China’s commodity imports, the main component of its overall import bill, offers more insight into the real state of the economy than looking at just the value. There are solid reasons to be cautious about the outlook for the Chinese economy and the impact from the trade dispute with the United States, and there are also questionmarks over whether the relatively robust commodity imports will sustain. But there is also a risk in turning too bearish too quickly by not accounting for the impact of weaker commodity prices on the value of imports by the world’s biggest buyer of commodities.

Contact between China and the United States boosted European stocks and U.S futures while sterling floundered near 20-month lows as the market sought clarity on the next steps for Brexit after Britain’s prime minister postponed a vote on her deal. China’s Vice Premier Liu He spoke with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, exchanging views on the next stage of trade talks. The sign China is moving ahead on talks with the United States helped rekindle investors’ appetite for equities, and trade-sensitive industrials, materials, and consumer stocks drove the rally. Euro zone stocks rose 1.4 percent and Germany’s DAX climbed 1.6 percent while Britain’s FTSE 100 rose 1.1 percent. Futures for Wall Street’s S&P500 and Dow shook off earlier losses, climbing 0.4-0.5 percent as investors hoped for a resolution to the trade conflict. China’s blue-chip index rose 0.5 percent overnight and MSCI’s world equity index gained 0.3 percent - set for its first day of gains after a five-day losing streak. Investors grappled with more uncertainty in Britain. Sterling hesitantly rose 0.4 percent to $1.2610 as traders sought to price in a range of possibilities after Prime Minister Theresa May’s abrupt decision to postpone a parliamentary vote on her Brexit agreement on Monday, a move that sent the pound spiralling down to $1.2505. Goldman Sachs analysts said volatility across UK assets has increased, with option markets pricing a wider range of outcomes including Brexit without a deal, a last-minute agreement or another referendum on EU membership. “We still think a no deal is a very low probability, but the uncertainty will persist for some time,” said Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at Blackrock. “The events of the last few days show you why there’s caution,” he added. May embarked on the first leg of a trip to meet European leaders on Tuesday, seeking support for changes to her Brexit deal, while at home pressure mounted and some lawmakers agitated for a vote of no confidence. The EU was adamant the withdrawal agreement, including its most contentious element - a “backstop” for the Northern Ireland frontier - could not be renegotiated. “Without major changes to the backstop, the odds are stacked against May if and when she brings her deal back to parliament,” said Kallum Pickering, an economist at Berenberg. Bond markets in Europe were focused on France as investors fretted over fiscal spending after the government announced concessions aimed at defusing weeks of often violent protests. President Emmanuel Macron announced wage rises for the poorest workers and tax cuts for pensioners. This sent French bond yields to their highest level over Germany’s in 19 months, with the spread over the safe-haven German Bund hitting 47.5 basis points. Macron’s announcement “leaves open the question about how the new fiscal measures will be covered financially,” wrote UniCredit analysts. Olivier Dussopt, junior minister for public accounts, said on BFM TV the measures would cost 8-10 billion euros ($9.1-$11.4 billion). The dollar index, which measures the U.S. dollar against a basket of major currencies, slipped 0.2 percent to 97.078 . In emerging markets, stocks rose 0.2 percent from one-month lows hit on Monday. The shock resignation of India’s central bank governor hurt India’s NSE share index initially, but it closed up 0.6 percent, helped by election results in three states which were not as poor for the ruling party as some had expected. Oil prices rebounded strongly from earlier losses, having sunk on Monday. U.S. crude futures and Brent futures were both up 0.7 percent to $51.39 and $60.40 respectively. Growth worries still stalked markets. Japan’s economy provided the latest negative data point, contracting the most in over four years in the third quarter, compounding worries over a slowing global economy. Disappointing economic data has fanned worries about corporate earnings and factory output, with the Sino-U.S. trade battle clouding the outlook for world growth. All sectors in Europe are in the red this year after oil became the last to give up all its 2018 gains, as investors licked their wounds and awaited the end of a bruising year.

2018-12-11,"(Updates with latest power outage numbers in third graph) By Rich McKay Atlanta, Dec 11 (Reuters) - At least three people had died and thousands of homes were left without power in the Carolinas and Virginia early on Tuesday after a storm dumped up to two feet of snow in parts of the southeastern United States. One person died from a heart condition while en route to a shelter and a terminally ill woman died when her oxygen device stopped working, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper’s office said in a statement. A motorist also died in southwestern North Carolina on Sunday when a tree fell on the vehicle, police said. More than 70,000 customers remained without electricity in the region as of 5 a.m. local time Tuesday, down from a high of 220,000 on Monday, Poweroutage.us reported. Weather warnings remained in effect. “The danger is black ice, ice that’s difficult to see on roads, caused by the re-freezing of snow melt,” said David Roth, a forecaster with the National Weather Service’ Weather Prediction Center in College Park Maryland. “It’ll be a risk for the next few mornings, probably through Thursday morning, before we see persistent temperatures above freezing in the area,” he said. Because of icy roads, scores of schools canceled or delayed classes Tuesday across northern Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia. Many government offices also delayed opening Tuesday for non-essential personnel. Late Sunday and early Monday, the storm dropped its heaviest snow in the appropriately named Whitetop, Virginia, tucked in the Appalachian Mountains along the western end of the Virginia-North Carolina border, the U.S. National Weather Service said. Whitetop got two feet of snow. Greensboro, North Carolina, had 16 inches (41 cm) and Durham, North Carolina, 14 inches (36 cm). Temperatures were expected to rise above freezing by late morning but will drop back below freezing overnight through Thursday, Roth said. By Friday, temperatures should reach into the 50s Fahrenheit in North Carolina east of the mountains when there is a chance of rain. No widespread flight delays were reported early Tuesday by the major airports in the southeast, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware. The storm, at its height, prompted the cancellation of one in four flights into and out of Charlotte/Douglas International Airport, the sixth-busiest in the country, and other airports across the region, FlightAware said.

2018-12-11,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Talks billed as the most important U.N. conference since the Paris 2015 deal on climate change are in their crucial final week in Katowice, capital of Poland’s Silesian coal mining district.  The aim is to meet an end-of-year deadline for agreeing a rule book on how to enforce action to limit further warming of the planet. Below is a flavour of the mood around the event, held in a sprawl of temporary passageways and meeting rooms next to the “Spodek”, a flying-saucer-shaped sports and concert venue built on the site of the former Katowice coal mine. Ministers and heads of state from around 130 countries have been arriving and will start to give opening speeches this afternoon. Meanwhile, their negotiating teams are working behind closed doors to have a draft text on the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement ready by 1700 GMT. Yesterday, France’s Laurent Fabius, who presided over the 2015 Paris Agreement, said he would be surprised if there was no deal struck on a rulebook by the end of the week but the level of ambition was an issue. “Taking into context recent (scientific) reports we have had, the numbers are bad and we are not on track ... so we have to be more ambitious. That is where the negotiations will make or break in the final hours,” he told reporters. The Pacific island nation of Vanuatu has called for a new “loss and damage fund” to ensure payments from rich, industrialised nations go to those most affected by climate disasters. “The idea of taxing the fossil fuel industry is an economically sensible approach, and a moral approach,” said Vanuatu’s foreign minister, Ralph Regenvanu. Before the talks, Vanuatu announced it would explore taking legal action against fossil fuel companies and countries for their role in causing climate change. Loss and damage compensation has always been a sticking point at U.N. climate talks.  In a central zone of the sprawling venue, countries have “pavilions” where they showcase their low-carbon efforts.  The Polish pavilion has been described as “provocative” by some environmentalists because one side has cages of coal on the wall with the slogan “black to green transformation” - implying coal can be used in a way that significantly reduces its carbon emissions. Qatar is usually in the lavish Gulf Cooperation Council pavilion but has its own, smaller one this year. The country is in a diplomatic rift with other members and its leader boycotted a GCC summit on Sunday. Last week, Qatar said it would quit OPEC to focus on gas, in a swipe at Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the oil exporting group which is trying to show unity in tackling an oil price slide.

2018-12-11,"KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Average world temperatures are on track to far exceed the central goal set in the 2015 Paris Agreement on limiting global warming, a study showed on Tuesday. But the overshoot by the end of this century could be slightly less severe than previously expected thanks to significant efforts by some countries to combat climate change, the report by Carbon Action Tracker (CAT) - a consortium of three independent European research groups - said. The Paris Agreement aims to restrict warming to “well below” two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The CAT report said there had been some progress on the ground since 2015, and current policies meant the world was heading for warming of 3.3C. That compared with the 3.4C it predicted a year ago, and it said that if governments were to implement planned or extra policies they had in the pipeline, warming by 2100 could be limited to 3C. Even a rise of 3C could cause loss of tropical coral reefs, Alpine glaciers, Arctic summer sea ice and perhaps an irreversible melt of Greenland’s ice that would drive up world sea levels, a United Nations science panel has said. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said in October that keeping the rise to 1.5C was possible but would require rapid and unprecedented changes in human behaviour. “We have yet to see this translate into action in terms of what governments are prepared to put on the table,” said Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, one of the three CAT research groups. Since the Paris accord was agreed, countries including Argentina, Canada, Chile and India plus the European Union were moving in the right direction towards cutting emissions. “If extended and scaled, these combined efforts could begin to bend the global emissions curve,” the report said.

2018-12-11,"(Adds Vaar Energy, PSA comment) OSLO, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Italian oil company Eni must do more to improve safety at its Arctic Goliat oilfield, which produces up to 100,000 barrels of crude per day, Norway’s oil safety watchdog said on Tuesday. The world’s northernmost oilfield has suffered a number of incidents since it started production in March 2016. While previous orders issued by the regulator, including a forced two-month shutdown in 2017, had led to some improvement, the Petroleum Safety Authority’s latest inspection found additional problems at Goliat, it added. “Faults and deficiencies are still (being) uncovered which, combined with the quantity of outstanding maintenance, present challenges related to handling individual and overall risks on the facility,” the PSA said in a statement. “The amount of outstanding work related to the electrical and instrumentation disciplines is relatively large. This applies to both improvements and the maintenance backlog,” it added. Eni acquired Norwegian oil firm Point Resources in July, merging it with its Norwegian subsidiary and renaming the unit Vaar Energy. Eni holds a 69.6 percent stake in Vaar, while Norwegian private equity firm HitecVision has the remaining 30.4 percent. Vaar took over operating the field on Dec. 10, after the PSA’s letter was sent to Eni on Nov. 29. Vaar Energy has a 65 percent stake in Goliat, while Norway’s Equinor holds the remaining 35 percent. A spokesman for Vaar said that work has already started to comply with PSA’s order, including increasing the number of maintenance staff. “We will respond by the deadlines set by the PSA, and therefore can not comment on the report in detail before that,” the spokesman said in an email. The PSA said the company had to comply with the order by March 1, 2019, including drawing up “a realistic and binding plan for completing outstanding safety-critical work”. “They have a lot of work to do and they are behind... Their plans are too optimistic,” a spokeswoman for the PSA said. PSA has powers to shut down production if the company fails to comply, she added.

2018-12-11,"SINGAPORE, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Noble Group said on Tuesday it will push on with its $3.5 billion debt restructuring by keeping the new company private, a last-minute effort to avoid seeking insolvency protection for its businesses. After consulting its creditors and advisors, the company will ask a Bermuda court on Dec. 14 to appoint an officer to Noble to enact its restructuring, it said in a statement to the Singapore Exchange (SGX). This follows a move by Singapore authorities last week barring Noble from re-listing the restructured company, dubbed New Noble, on the SGX because of allegations of improper accounting. The re-listing is a key part of its controversial debt-for-equity restructuring plan that has been in the works for nearly two years. Noble, once Asia’s biggest commodity trader, has warned that if the restructuring fails, it would begin insolvency proceedings, likely in Britain. In Tuesday’s statement, Noble said the court officer will be appointed to the company only and not to any of its subsidiaries, which will continue to trade normally. “The day-to-day operations of the group will therefore be unaffected: the group’s trade finance facilities will continue to be available to it and payments to customers and suppliers will be made as usual,” Noble said. “Existing shareholders of the company would still receive the New Noble shares to be allocated to them and therefore will continue to participate in any potential recovery upside,” it said. Under the restructuring, Noble’s debt would be halved. In return, the firm’s creditors, made up mostly of hedge funds, would own 70 percent of the restructured business, while existing shareholders’ equity would be reduced to 20 percent and Noble’s management would get 10 percent. “The restructuring terms are the same, except that the company’s existing shareholders will own 20 percent of a privately held firm instead of a listed one,” one source familiar with the deal told Reuters. Noble’s market value has been all but wiped out from $6 billion over the past four years after its accounting was questioned by Iceberg Research in February 2015. Noble has sold billions of dollars of assets, taken hefty writedowns and cut hundreds of jobs, while defending its accounting. ]nL3N1VI1TH] Noble said that subject to the court order on Dec. 14, the restructuring will come into effect on Dec. 18.

2018-12-11,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s future environment minister under President-elect Jair Bolsonaro said on Monday that the country should stay in the Paris Agreement on climate change, but the world must also  respect its autonomy to set its environmental policies. Bolsonaro said on the campaign trail that he could pull out of the Paris Agreement, which sets targets for countries to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. But he has sent mixed signals on his intentions since being elected, saying that Brazil could stay in the agreement if certain conditions are met. “My inclination is ...to say that we shouldn’t leave the agreement,” Ricardo Salles, who is tipped to become minister after Bolsonaro assumes office Jan. 1, said in an interview. “But on the other hand, it doesn’t signify that we will accept any and all sanctions, restrictions and programs indisputably.  “All countries must respect Brazilian autonomy to manage its territory and to decide its environmental policies internally,” he said. Brazil has committed to cutting emissions 37 percent by 2025 and 43 percent by 2030 under the agreement, although the country has yet to fully lay out how it will meet those goals. Brazil will use common sense in the details of how it will deal with the agreement, and the country thus far has been very responsible in preserving a large percent of its native vegetation, Salles said. Salles, who previously served as the top environmental official for the state of Sao Paulo, said he does believe climate change exists, although he could not say for sure whether it is man-made or a change that is occurring naturally. Brazil should leave that question to academics and get on with the “less charming” business of environmental protection, he said, including dealing with waste, biodiversity, soil issues and converting the car fleet to lower emission biofuels. Bolsonaro will not cut the budget of the ministry and environmental agencies it oversees, which includes enforcer Ibama and conservation area administrator ICMBio, Salles said. But environmental agencies are not producing the results they should be with the resources they are given, and he said he will seek to correct this “mismanagement” and “inefficiency.”  Asked about whether Brazil should reconsider Ibama’s decision last week to deny Total SA a permit to drill in the sensitive Foz do Amazonas basin near the Amazon rainforest, Salles said they would have to make sure ideology did not enter into the decision and that it was solely based on facts. The country must strike a balance in environmental licensing, whether for farms or mines, and development, as overly strict rules drive people to illegality or lead producers to exit the market, he said.

2018-12-11,"(Adds Rouhani quotes and background) GENEVA, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Exports of Iranian oil have improved since early November, Iran’s president Hassan Rouhani said in a statement broadcast live on state TV on Tuesday. The United States imposed sanctions on Iran’s oil industry in early November and U.S. officials have said they want to reduce Iran’s oil exports to zero. Tensions have spiked between Iran and the United States after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of an international agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme in May. He said the deal was flawed because it did not include curbs on Iran’s development of ballistic missiles or its support for proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Iraq. “The goal of the Americans was to block our oil exports. I want to say frankly to our people that our oil exports after (Nov. 4) have improved by degrees,” Rouhani said. “So the Americans have been unsuccessful with regard to the oil issue.” The United States was also unsuccessful in preventing OPEC from cutting production, Rouhani said. OPEC and its Russia-led allies agreed last week to slash oil production by more than the market had expected despite pressure from Trump to reduce the price of crude. “The Americans were unsuccessful in this OPEC meeting and the Islamic Republic of Iran, fortunately, had some good successes,” Rouhani said. “The process of selling our oil will continue in the same way as it did before this meeting.” Reporting by Babak Dehghanpisheh, editing by Louise Heavens",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-iran/update-1-iranian-oil-exports-have-improved-since-early-november-iran-president-idUKL8N1YG17N,11 Dec 2018,"Exports of Iranian oil have

The EU has been divided for months over how strict to be on CO2 emissions from cars and vans. Germany, with the bloc’s biggest auto sector, has warned that tough targets could harm industry and cost jobs. Representatives of lawmakers in the European Parliament of the 28 EU countries have held several rounds of talks together with the European Commission designed to find common ground and ended after six hours early on Tuesday, EU diplomats said. The EU executive initially proposed that emissions decline by 30 percent by 2030, compared to 2021 levels. Germany backed that plan, but a push by several EU countries, including the Netherlands and France, raised the target to 35 percent. There is also an intermediate target for 2025. European Parliament lawmakers voted in favour of a 40 percent reduction in October, drawing howls from the car industry. EU diplomats said the targets remained a problem. The targets to curb emissions from the transport sector, the only industry in which emissions are still rising, are aimed at helping the bloc reach its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions overall by 40 percent by 2030. EU countries are separately considering the extent to which truck emissions should be cut. Extreme temperatures across the northern hemisphere this summer have fuelled concerns climate change is gathering pace, galvanising some EU countries to call for emissions to be cut at a faster rate than planned. Eight such EU countries, including the Netherlands and Sweden, believe that the emissions cut should be 40 percent for cars and say there is a clear majority of countries willing to move beyond 35 percent. One EU diplomat from a country seeking a more ambitious cut said it appeared that Austria, which holds the EU presidency and is negotiating on behalf of the other EU states, was simply waiting for assent from Germany. The EU is attending talks billed as the most important U.N. conference since the Paris 2015 deal on climate change, which have begun a crucial final week in the Polish city of Katowice. The challenge is to agree a rule book to limit global warming.

2018-12-11,"(Removes extraneous text in 4th paragraph.) By Koustav Samanta SINGAPORE, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Asian jet fuel price discounts stand at their lowest December levels in nine years as a supply glut offsets consumption even as the region’s aviation sector booms. The slump is a mirror image of the steep gains Asian aviation fuel price differentials saw in the first quarter of this year. Then, tight supply lifted them to their highest seasonal levels in a decade. The cash differentials for jet fuel in the Asian trading hub of Singapore were at a discount of $1.06 a barrel below benchmark quotes on Monday JET-SIN-DIF, the weakest for this time of year since 2009, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Cash differentials represent the price buyers are prepared to pay for fuel over or below benchmark values published daily by price reporting agencies. “Clearly the physical market does not believe that the high prices of jet paper (contracts) are justified,” said Sukrit Vijayakar, director of energy consultancy Trifecta. “That is what is causing the weakness in the cash differentials.” The weakness also comes as winter in the northern hemisphere has seen a mild start: The outlook is largely for an unusually mild season because of an El Nino weather pattern. That’s especially the case in Japan, where kerosene - almost identical to jet fuel - is commonly used for heating. The low kerosene consumption and high yields for churning out jet fuel are luring refiners to pump out more of the latter, market sources said, weighing on the price traders are willing to buy it for. And the low cash prices are starting to weigh on refinery margins, traders said. Refining margins, also known as cracks, for jet fuel were at $15.66 a barrel over Dubai crude during Asian trading hours on Monday - down 19 percent in the last four weeks. Despite that, jet cracks remain comparatively high - the peak of $19.34 a barrel on Nov. 15 was a near four-year high - and seasonally adjusted refinery cracks for jet fuel are still at their strongest levels for this time of the year since 2014. “Refiners can take comfort from the fact that aviation demand is really good...Jet cracks are very high,” said Vijayakar.

Despite deepening political uncertainty in Britain, spreadbetters expected a positive start for Europe with FTSE futures seen rising 0.7 percent. But e-minis for the S&P500 and Dow futures were both down 0.3 percent. “The global growth drivers that produced the regional upturn have started to fade,” S&P Global Ratings said in a note as it lowered forecasts for almost every country in the Asia-Pacific. “We continue to see mainly downside risks to our Asia-Pacific growth forecasts,” it added. “Global trade and investment friction remain top of mind for Asia. If friction escalates, the key casualty would be manufacturing investment.” Disappointing data from major economies including China and Japan have fanned worries about corporate earnings and factory output, with the Sino-U.S. trade battle clouding the outlook for world growth. These uncertainties have put the brakes on equities this year, with MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan skidding more than 16 percent after surging 33.5 percent in 2017. The MSCI ex-Japan index reversed earlier losses but was still near a three-week trough touched on Monday. Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.3 percent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was off 0.1 percent. India’s NSE share index tumbled in early trade after the shock resignation of the country’s central bank governor late on Monday, but the benchmark later pared losses and inched into positive territory. Traders in India are now cautiously awaiting results from crucial state elections due later in the day. Some exit poll suggested Prime Minister Narendra Modi may be facing his biggest defeat since he took office in 2014, and months ahead of a general election. Chinese shares inched up on news that the country’s Vice Premier Liu He had spoken with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, exchanging views on pushing forward the next stage of trade talks. Chinese equities opened in the positive territory and the blue-chip index was last up 0.1 percent. Australian shares gained 0.4 percent while the Aussie dollar bounced too. Yet the gains were tentative as markets fretted over the prospects for a lasting resolution to a trade dispute that has turned increasingly bitter in the past several months. “We expect concerns over growth to dominate in 2019,” a BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research report said. “The evolution of the US-China trade conflict and a sharp slowdown in China presents the biggest risk to our outlook for ASEAN.” “A faster de-escalation could help cushion the slowdown but is unlikely to reinvigorate the economic cycle which has matured.” Adding to the gloom in markets, British Prime Minister Theresa May abruptly postponed a parliamentary vote on her Brexit agreement on Monday, a move that hit risk assets globally and sent the pound spiralling down to $1.2505. Sterling slumped below important chart support around $1.26. With the European Union refusing to renegotiate the deal, lawmakers doubted her chances of winning big changes.

2018-12-11,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - The prevailing market narrative after China’s overall November trade data was that the world’s second-biggest economy is softening and starting to show the strains of the trade dispute with the United States. After all, both imports and exports undershot forecasts for the month. But while there is nothing inherently incorrect in such commentary, one factor that may not be getting as much attention as it should - the lower-than-anticipated growth in imports may be largely related to weaker commodity prices. China’s exports rose 5.4 percent in November from a year earlier, well short of the 10 percent forecast in a Reuters poll. Imports grew a sluggish 3 percent, considerably weaker than the 14.5 percent forecast. The export weakness was largely put down to the end of front-loading of shipments to the United States ahead of the now postponed higher tariffs of 25 percent on $200 billion of imports from China that had been mooted by President Donald Trump. The import weakness was largely ascribed to slacker domestic demand. While this may be the situation for manufactured goods and services, it doesn’t appear to be the case for commodities. The problem with simply looking at the trade numbers is that they are expressed in U.S. dollar terms, and not in volume terms. Case in point - crude oil, where China is the world’s biggest importer. China imported a record 10.43 million barrels per day (bpd), the first time inbound shipments had topped the 10 million bpd mark, and well above the 9.6 million bpd recorded in October. Working out exactly how much China paid for its oil in November is challenging, but it’s likely to be less than it paid in October, despite the extra 15.1 million barrels imported. Exhibit A: Brent crude hit a four-year high of $86.74 a barrel on Oct. 3 and has since slumped 27 percent to its close of $59.97 on Monday. This means that at the time Chinese refiners were fixing cargoes for November delivery, prices were declining, encouraging volume growth. (Graphic: China's trade and economy: tmsnrt.rs/2iO9Q6a) Of course, there are other factors at work: The start-up of new refineries and their associated inventory buying, increased purchases by smaller, independent refiners aiming to use up their import quotas before they expire, and uncertainty over when exactly imports of Iranian oil cleared customs. But the overall picture isn’t one of weakness for China’s crude oil imports, which are now up 8.4 percent for the first 11 months of the year, compared to the same period in 2017. While copper imports were weaker in November compared to the same month a year earlier, they were also up strongly from October, with unwrought copper jumping 8.6 percent on-month and ores and concentrates up 8.9 percent. Three-month London copper prices peaked in early June and have subsequently dropped about 17 percent. That means Chinese buyers would have been paying substantially less for their imports in November than in prior months. Iron ore and coal present more interesting reading. Imports of both fell in November from October, despite weaker prices. Iron ore imports slipped 2.4 percent to 86.25 million tonnes, while coal purchases from overseas dropped 17 percent to 19.15 million tonnes. But the weakness in these imports is almost entirely policy driven. In other words, it’s the deliberate choice of Beijing to import less, rather than a sign of domestic economic weakness. The authorities have made it clear they didn’t want coal imports in 2018 to exceed those of 2017 in order to protect the local mining industry. While they will fail in this endeavour, as the first 11 months of 2018 has seen imports reach the total for 2017, it does mean that November and December coal imports will be well below potential. Iron ore is struggling along with steel as winter production curbs aimed at lowering air pollution start to have an impact on the market. Overall, the volume of China’s commodity imports, the main component of its overall import bill, offers more insight into the real state of the economy than looking at just the value. There are solid reasons to be cautious about the outlook for the Chinese economy and the impact from the trade dispute with the United States, and there are also questionmarks over whether the relatively robust commodity imports will sustain. But there is also a risk in turning too bearish too quickly by not accounting for the impact of weaker commodity prices on the value of imports by the world’s biggest buyer of commodities.

2018-12-11,"(Repeats with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2PtIemz By John Kemp LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The weakening outlook for oil consumption coupled with rising output from U.S. shale and softer than expected U.S. sanctions on Iran have convinced most traders the market is moving into a period of oversupply. In the run up to last week’s OPEC meeting in Vienna, hedge fund managers had little confidence in the organisation’s ability to cut production by enough to avoid an oversupplied market next year. Fund managers sold another 32 million barrels of Brent futures and options in the week to Dec. 4, bringing total sales over the last 10 weeks to a record 360 million barrels. Funds now hold just over two long positions for every short one, down from a ratio of more than 19:1 at the end of September, and the least-bullish position for 17 months. Bearish short positions have risen to 117 million barrels, up from just 27 million at the end of September, and the largest number since June 2017. Pessimism about the outlook for crude prices was reflected by a similar collapse in sentiment towards middle distillates such as gasoil (tmsnrt.rs/2PtIemz). Fund managers sold another 20 million barrels of European gasoil, bringing total sales in the last eight weeks to 82 million barrels. Funds are the least-bullish towards middle distillates since July 2017, according to an analysis of position data from ICE Futures Europe. Middle distillates are heavily geared towards the economic cycle because most distillate fuel oil is used in freight transportation (shipping, railroads, aviation, trucks), manufacturing, mining and farming. So the collapse in sentiment towards distillates is consistent with growing concerns about the outlook for the global economy in 2019. Investors’ fears about the impact of trade tensions and heightened uncertainty on business investment and growth next year is darkening the outlook for distillates just as it is hitting equity markets. Expected oversupply of crude has been reflected in the sharp fall in Brent spot prices since the start of October and the futures curve swinging from backwardation into contango. OPEC and selected non-OPEC countries agreed last week to cut their output by 1.2 million barrels per day during the first six months of 2019 from the level in October 2018. Most of the cuts will come from Saudi Arabia, with smaller contributions likely to come from Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Oman. Other OPEC and non-OPEC countries are unlikely to reduce their output voluntarily by any significant amount so their participation in the agreement is mostly symbolic. The planned production cuts reverse the OPEC+ group’s earlier ramp up in output and should offset the softer enforcement of U.S. sanctions on Iran. By cutting output promptly and aggressively, OPEC+ may be able to avert a large build up in excess oil inventories next year and a collapse in prices similar to 2014/15. In contrast to 2014, Saudi-led OPEC has opted to sacrifice market share in an effort to defend prices at a higher level despite the rapid growth of U.S. shale. But there is little the group can do about the deteriorating economic outlook, which implies the need for a period of lower oil prices to restrain production and stimulate consumption to keep the market balanced. And as the global economy reels from the tariff war between the United States and China, rising interest rates, tightening credit conditions, and a broader economic slowdown, lower oil prices are a necessary part of the economic adjustment process.

2018-12-11,"* Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Pound near 20-month trough on Brexit related uncertainty * Disappointing economic data, Sino-U.S. trade war weigh * Wall St staged late rebound, positive cue for Asia By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, Dec 11 (Reuters) - The pound hovered near 20-month lows on Tuesday, as political turmoil deepened in Britain with a key vote on Brexit being delayed while U.S. shares staged a late rebound in a positive signal for Asian markets. British Prime Minister Theresa May abruptly postponed a parliamentary vote on her Brexit agreement, a move that hit risk assets globally and sent the pound spiralling to $1.2505. Separately, disappointing data from major economies including China and Japan have fanned worries about global economic activity. The ongoing Sino-U.S. trade battle has also clouded the outlook for world growth. All that has put brakes to the rapid momentum in equities, with MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan skidding more than 16 percent so far this year. It had surged 33.5 percent in 2017. The index was last off 0.1 percent. Australian shares gained 0.6 percent while Japan’s Nikkei lifted 0.2 percent. Overnight on Wall Street, major indexes bounced modestly from an initial drop due in part to a recovery in Apple shares . The Dow added 0.1 percent, the S&P 500 gained 0.2 percent and the Nasdaq climbed 0.7 percent. But analysts said overall sentiment was still fragile. “The bear market vibe at the end of 2018 is expected to continue, with asset prices finding their lows in the first half of 2019 once rate expectations peak and global earnings expectations trough,” according to BofAML. For the year ahead, BofAML has forecast modest gains in equities and credit, a weaker dollar, widening credit spreads, and a flattening to inverted yield curve - a combination that calls for heightened volatility. Sterling cracked below important chart support around $1.26 as May delayed the vote and the European Union refused to renegotiate while lawmakers doubted her chances of winning big changes. The dollar climbed on the yen to 113.19. An index that measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies has jumped 5.5 percent so far this year as investors pile on the dollar as a safe haven bet. The currency also gained as the U.S. Federal Reserve stayed on its policy tightening path, although uncertainties over how much further the Fed can go have turned dollar bets sour. Among emerging markets, investors will focus on India where the central bank governor abruptly resigned. In commodities, oil prices echoed the weakness in global stock markets amid worries about a slowdown in demand.

2018-12-11,"SINGAPORE, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Oil prices remained on shaky ground on Tuesday after sliding by 3 percent the previous day, pressured by weakness in global stock markets and doubts that planned supply cuts led by producer club OPEC will be enough to rein in oversupply. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $51 per barrel at 0028 GMT, unchanged from their last close. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. Crude prices dropped by 3 percent the session before amid ongoing weakness in global stock markets and concerns that slowing oil demand-growth could erode supply cuts announced last week by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC producers including Russia. Crude prices are down around a third since early October amid the financial market slump and an emerging oil supply overhang. “There remains a lot of uncertainty if the production cut is thick enough to make a significant dent in global supply,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore. “The general risk-off tone in global markets and the stronger dollar ... are contributing to the selling pressure.” The OPEC-led group of oil producers last Friday announced a supply cut of 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in crude oil supply from January, measured against October 2018 output levels.

2018-12-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will provide 100 million pounds ($127 million) for a scheme to help to support renewable power projects in sub-Saharan Africa, the government said on Tuesday. The funding pledge comes as delegates from more than 190 countries meet in Poland to flesh out how to reach commitments made under the 2015 Paris Agreement to keep the rise in global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius this century. Britain will invest the money into the co-called Renewable Energy Performance Platform (REPP) which aims to support renewable energy projects, such as solar, wind and hydro in sub-Saharan Africa. British energy minister Claire Perry said in a statement the money would help to provide hundreds of thousands of people with electricity for the first time. The 100 million pounds will help to fund up to 40 projects, capable of providing electricity for 2.4 million people a year, Britain’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial strategy said in the statement. The funding is in addition to 48 million pounds previously committed to the REPP by Britain, the statement said. Projects already being supported by REPP include solar projects in Tanzania and Burundi and a hydropower project in Kenya.  The funding is also part of Britain’s overall commitment to invest 5.8 billion pounds in international climate finance by 2020. Reporting by Susanna Twidale.
