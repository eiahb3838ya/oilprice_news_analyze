2018-12-20,"WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - The United States and three allies chastised China for economic espionage on Thursday, ratcheting up tensions as U.S. prosecutors indicted two Chinese nationals linked to a spy agency on charges of stealing confidential data from American government agencies and businesses around the world. Prosecutors charged Zhu Hua and Zhang Jianguo in hacking attacks against the U.S. Navy, the space agency NASA and the Energy Department and dozens of companies. The operation targeted intellectual property and corporate secrets to give Chinese companies an unfair competitive advantage, they said. Britain, Australia and New Zealand joined the United States in slamming China over what they called a global campaign of cyber-enabled commercial intellectual property theft, signalling growing global coordination against the practice. “No country poses a broader, more severe long-term threat to our nation’s economy and cyber infrastructure than China,” FBI Director Chris Wray said at a news conference. “China’s goal, simply put, is to replace the U.S. as the world’s leading superpower, and they’re using illegal methods to get there.”  Five sources familiar with the attacks told Reuters the hackers breached the networks of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co and IBM, then used the access to hack into their clients’ computers. IBM said it had no evidence that sensitive data had been compromised. HPE said it could not comment. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other officials in President Donald Trump’s administration said China’s hacking effort, which U.S. officials said began in 2006 and ran through 2018, violated a 2015 agreement intended to crack down on cyber espionage for commercial purposes.  Britain agreed. The campaign is “one of the most serious, strategically significant, persistent and potentially damaging set of cyber intrusions against the UK and our allies that we have seen,” a British security official said.  Victims included NASA’s Goddard Space Centre and Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Energy Department’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and companies involved in aviation, space and satellite technology, finance, electronics, healthcare, oil and gas exploration, according to court documents. “The list of victim companies reads like a ‘Who’s Who’ of the global economy,” Wray said. He did not name the businesses. Tensions between Washington and Beijing are high over tit-for-tat trade tariffs and after Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies, was arrested in Canada at the request of the United States. Meng was arrested on the same day the United States and China agreed to talks to resolve the trade dispute. Prosecutors charged the defendants, who they said worked with China’s Ministry of State Security intelligence agency, with conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Zhu and Zhang were members of a hacking group known within the cyber security community as APT 10 and also worked for a Tianjin company Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Co, prosecutors said. NASA said it did not believe agency missions were jeopardized by the hacking and took immediate action to secure affected servers. China’s embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.  APT10 also stole personal data including Social Security numbers from more than 100,000 U.S. Navy personnel, they said. A Navy spokesperson said that sailors are notified immediately when there is a data breach, but declined further comment due to an ongoing investigation.  The hacking targets also include technology firms that provide outsourced email, storage and other computing tasks, according to court documents. This is the latest in a series of hacking cases brought by the United States against Chinese nationals. In October, the U.S. government charged Chinese intelligence officers with stealing information on a turbo fan engine used in commercial jetliners. The same month, the Justice Department arrested an alleged spy for China’s Ministry of State Security on charges of economic espionage and attempting to steal U.S. aviation trade secrets. In September, a Chinese national who had enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve was arrested in Chicago for allegedly working for Chinese intelligence to recruit engineers and scientists, including some who worked for U.S. defence contractors. Australian officials issued a statement expressing “serious concern” about Chinese commercial intellectual property theft. An official in New Zealand said in a statement the country “joins likeminded partners in expressing that such cyber campaigns are unacceptable.” Canada, Japan, the Netherlands and Sweden also were expected to denounce Chinese cyber efforts, according to a source who spoke on condition of anonymity.

2018-12-20,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian federal prosecutors on Thursday charged 12 people in connection with an alleged bribery scheme meant to benefit oil trader Vitol Group at the expense of Brazil’s state-led oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA). Prosecutors say at least $2.85 million (£2.25 million) in bribes were involved, but have called their discoveries so far the “tip of the iceberg.”    Petrobras said in an emailed response to Reuters that it had suspended oil trades with Vitol, along with other massive trading firms Trafigura and Glencore (GLEN.L), which also face accusations in the same probe.  Petrobras said it demanded an explanation from the firms about what actions they are taking to address the allegations lodged by Brazilian investigators. A Vitol spokeswoman declined to comment, but said the company would always cooperate with investigators. A spokesman for Glencore declined to comment, and Trafigura did not immediately reply to requests for comment.  Last week, Vitol and Glencore told Reuters they would work with investigators, while Trafigura said it was reviewing the allegations. Trafigura and Vitol said they have zero-tolerance policies for bribery and corruption, while Glencore said it takes ethics and compliance seriously. Those charged on Thursday include former Petrobras employees and middlemen who prosecutors allege worked directly with top executives at Vitol.  Brazilian prosecutors last week levelled corruption charges against two former Trafigura executives. In Thursday’s charging document, prosecutors said one of Vitol’s top executives, Mike Loya, head of the firm in the United States, and Antonio Maarraoui, the company’s head for Latin American and the Caribbean, had full knowledge of the scheme. Neither Loya nor Maarraoui was charged on Thursday. Neither of the executives has replied to repeated requests for comment. Brazil’s unprecedented sprawling graft investigations have been built on plea-bargain testimony.  Prosecutors told Reuters they will aggressively use the same tactics in this case: charge smaller figures involved and work to reach plea deals with them, seeking testimony against the executives at the foreign firms they allege are involved.       The stakes are high for the trading firms. Brazilian prosecutors allege some of the crimes were carried out by Petrobras traders based in Houston and that some illicit funds moved through the U.S. and European banking systems, raising the chance that jurisdiction for investigating the case would widen. Brazilian and U.S. prosecutors have worked closely in the past on Car Wash cases. Loans to the companies could dry up if the corruption allegations stick, according to a senior banking executive at a major global bank who declined to be identified. Since the 2008 financial crisis, big banks have faced increased scrutiny from regulators to crack down on money laundering and other financial crimes. The probe has already frozen their current business in Brazil, an increasingly important global oil producer, but not yet a major source of revenue for the firms. Trafigura said its turnover in Brazil last year was $300 million, a fraction of its overall $136 billion in 2017. Glencore and Vitol would not provide revenue details, but said Brazil was a minor market.  Vitol has a deal pending to purchase a stake in Petrobras’ prized Nigerian oilfields. In its statement to Reuters, Petrobras said there were no indications of wrongdoing in that deal, but it would be up to Brazilian regulators to make the final determination. The new developments are also a signal that Brazil’s landmark “Car Wash” probe is far from over.  Launched to investigate contracting graft at Petrobras, the probe and resulting trials have toppled scores of powerful business and political figures, including construction industry moguls and former presidents of Brazil and Peru. Foreign oil companies are now in the cross hairs, said prosecutor Athayde Ribeiro Costa, who is heading the latest phase of the probe.  Costa told Reuters that any firm that has done business with Petrobras since 2003 would come under intense scrutiny. He added that other major firms have approached Brazilian prosecutors to sound them out about leniency deals. He declined to name the companies.

A company spokesman said on Czech Television eight others were injured in the blast, which caused devastation in some underground work areas with poor visibility obstructing the efforts of rescue units. State-owned OKD operates shafts in the Karvina region near the Polish border. Spokesman Ivo Celechovsky said the explosion took place about 800 metres (875 yards) under the surface after 5 p.m. (1600 GMT) on Thursday. “The death toll has grown to five, eight miners are missing and 10 miners, mostly Polish, were injured,” he said. “Rescue works are continuing.” (Reporting by Jan Lopatka; Editing by Alison Williams and Tom Brown)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/czech-mine-blast/update-1-five-dead-eight-missing-after-methane-explosion-in-czech-coal-mine-idUKL8N1YP7KQ,20 Dec 2018,"Five miners died and eight were

2018-12-20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World equity markets continued a week-long slide on Thursday, one day after the U.S. Federal Reserve indicated it was set on its path to hike interest rates next year despite signs that global economic growth is stuttering. The Fed’s move on Wednesday largely to adhere to its plan for additional rate hikes over the next two years raised worries for market participants from Asia to Europe, and major indexes fell to their lowest in two years as investors flocked to the relative safety of government debt.  European shares fell nearly 1.5 percent  on Thursday, with benchmark indexes in Germany DAX., Britain .FTSE and France .FCHI all hitting their lowest since late 2016. Indexes in Japan and South Korea fell into a bear market, defined as a 20 percent decline from recent highs, joining benchmark indexes in Shanghai and Hong Kong. MSCI’s global equity index .MIWD00000PUS fell to its lowest since May 2017, shedding nearly 1.5 percent as it headed for a fifth straight day of losses.  “All people are talking about today is the aftermath of the Fed hike. The Fed just killed the notion that they are here to backstop the market,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 464.06 points, or 1.99 percent, to 22,859.6, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 40.14 points, or 1.60 percent, to 2,466.82 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 108.42 points, or 1.63 percent, to 6,528.41. The Fed on Wednesday stuck by a plan to keep withdrawing support from an economy it considers robust raised key overnight lending rates as expected by 0.25 percentage point. It said “some further gradual” rate hikes would be needed in the year ahead, with policymakers projecting two rises on average next year instead of the three predicted in September.     Although largely in line with expectations, that tweak did little to soothe investor concerns over slowing world growth, U.S. trade tensions with China and tightening monetary conditions for companies in the world’s biggest economy. “It appears that risky asset markets wanted a stronger ‘put’ from the Fed given the ongoing recession obsession taking over the market sentiment,” said Salman Ahmed, global investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. The equity losses added to the worst year for world stock markets since the 2008 global financial crisis, with MSCI’s 47-country world stocks index .MIWD00000PUS down 10 percent.     Nearly $7 trillion has been wiped off global stock markets this year, with emerging markets trampled flat by a charging dollar.  The angst in equity markets pushed investors toward the safety of government bonds. German 10-year government bond yields, the euro zone benchmark, fell to their lowest in nearly seven months. Other high grade euro zone bond yields also fell. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR last fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.8012 percent, from 2.776 percent late on Wednesday. Oil prices, meanwhile, slumped as worries about oversupply and worldwide demand for energy pushed prices back toward their lowest in over a year. U.S. crude fell more than 4 percent to $46.14 per barrel, while Brent fell 4.1 percent to $54.87 per barrel.  “Growth concerns continue to percolate in the background, and you can see that with oil prices coming off,” said Alvin Tan, a foreign exchange strategist at Societe Generale.  The dollar index .DXY fell 0.68 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.7 percent to $1.1455.

2018-12-20,"(Adds details, background) By Ahmed Elumami and Ayman al-Warfalli TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI, Libya, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Libya’s Sharara oilfield remains closed, state oil firm NOC said on Thursday, resisting pressure from some officials to quickly pay off protesters which shut it down. On Wednesday, Libya’s internationally recognised government said the 315,000 barrels a day field, the country’s biggest, would reopen after Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj flew there to meet protesters who seized the southern facility on Dec 8. Sarraj had called the demands of the protesters - made up of state guards and tribesmen - as legitimate. Oil sources later said preparations were being made to restart output. But a conflict then erupted between the government and NOC which wants to stop getting blackmailed by protesters, often armed, who occupy fields to demand cash and jobs. NOC Charman Mustafa Sanalla said that force majeure, a contractual waiver, would not be lifted at Sharara until alternative security arrangements were in place, a statement said. He warned of “catastrophic consequences for both the oil sector and country of ransom payments to the armed group occupying the Sharara oil field”. The Tripoli goverment has announced a development fund worth 1 billion dinars ($717 million) for the long-neglected south in a bid to appease the protesters. Sanalla has drawn criticism from some officials for framing the occupiers as an armed group. They are joined by tribesmen, who demand better state services for the south, which produces around 400,000 bpd of day but lacks basic facilities such as hospitals or electricity. Some state guards, which NOC said had facilitated the protest, had demanded salaries they said they were owed. The OPEC member had before the closure boosted output to up to 1.3 million barrels a day. NOC is widely seen by armed groups and civilian protesters as an easy target to milk. El Sharara crude is transported to the Zawiya port, which is also home to a refinery. NOC runs the field with Spain’s Repsol, France’s Total, Austria’s OMV and Norway’s Equinor , formerly known as Statoil. $1 = 1.4 Libyan dinars

2018-12-20,"Dec 20 (Reuters) - Chester County District Attorney Tom Hogan opened a criminal investigation into Energy Transfer LP’s construction of the Mariner East natural gas liquids pipelines in Pennsylvania. “We have seen sinkholes created by the pipeline drilling, contaminated well water and some subtle and not-so-subtle bullying of Chester County citizens by big corporate interests,” Hogan said in a release on Wednesday. This is the latest in a long series of legal and regulatory actions against Energy Transfer over construction of the Mariner East 2 pipeline. “We vehemently deny any such wrongdoing and we take issue with the many factual inaccuracies contained in the District Attorney’s press release,” Energy Transfer said in a statement on Thursday, saying the company looked forward to opening a dialogue with the District Attorney’s Office. Mariner East transports liquids from the Marcellus and Utica shale fields in western Pennsylvania to customers in the state and elsewhere, including international exports from Energy Transfer’s Marcus Hook complex near Philadelphia. Energy Transfer started work on a $2.5 billion expansion of the project in February 2017 and had planned to finish the new 350-mile (563-kilometer) pipeline in the third quarter of 2017. But completion has been delayed by several work stoppages by state agencies due to permit violations and other problems, including release of drilling fluids into waterways and discovery of sinkholes. Energy Transfer has said it expects to put Mariner East 2 into service by the end of the year. The pipe crosses Chester County in the southeast part of the state. In addition to accusing the company of criminal wrongdoing, Hogan said the governor and state agencies have not done enough to police Energy Transfer’s construction of Mariner East. “We expected the state regulators and the governor to step in and assure the safety of Pennsylvanians. They have not,” Hogan said, so “now the Chester County District Attorney’s Office will demand that every aspect of these pipelines be conducted safely.” In response, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) said it has issued more than 80 notices for permit violations and collected more than $13 million in penalties. “The commonwealth is living up to our promise to hold this project accountable,” the DEP said. Hogan said potential charges included causing or risking a catastrophe, criminal mischief and environmental crimes, which could result in criminal charges against workers on the pipeline and corporate officers.

Brent hit a session low of $54.28 a barrel, its lowest price since mid-September 2017, while WTI sank to $45.67, its lowest price since late August 2017. (GRAPHIC: Fed Open Market Committee projections - tmsnrt.rs/2A6JneW) Global stock markets dropped after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates on Wednesday and maintained most of its guidance for additional hikes over the next two years, dashing investor hopes for a more dovish policy outlook.  U.S. stock markets continued their decline on Thursday, dragging oil prices lower. [.N]  “Any additional weakening in risk appetite as underscored by a further drop in the equities could easily keep the speculative entities in WTI engaged in exiting remaining long holdings,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. Both major oil futures contracts have fallen more than 35 percent from multi-year highs reached at the beginning of October. Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency, said on Thursday he does not expect a sharp increase in oil prices in the short term, unless there are geopolitical problems. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers including Russia agreed this month to curb output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in an attempt to drain tanks and boost prices. But the cuts will not happen until next month, and production has been at or near record highs in the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia. “The market remains skeptical of the ability of OPEC and Russian oil producers to rein in runaway output,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York. “This has become a ‘show-me’ market - assertions or commitments to cut are not enough right now.” OPEC plans to release a table detailing voluntary output cut quotas for its members and allies such as Russia in an effort to shore up prices, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said in a letter seen by Reuters on Thursday. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he expected global oil stocks to fall by the end of the first quarter, but added that the market remained vulnerable to political and economic factors as well as speculation. U.S. crude inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. crude futures, rose by 1.85 million barrels in the week through Dec. 18, traders said, citing data from market intelligence firm Genscape.

The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard requires oil refiners to blend biofuels like ethanol into their fuel each year or buy compliance credits from competitors that do. But it allows the EPA to exempt smaller plants if they show complying would cause financial hardship. The EPA has vastly expanded the program under President Donald Trump. But farm-state lawmakers have complained that the waivers are being overused in a way that is killing demand for corn-based ethanol. The agency is reviewing how it handles further requests as it seeks to balance the competing interests of refiners and ethanol producers. Firms have until March of the following year to prove compliance for the calendar year. The EPA granted 29 hardship waivers for compliance year 2017, the data showed, up from 19 for 2016 and just seven for 2015. Seven more petitions were pending review for compliance year 2017, while one was declared ineligible or withdrawn. On Wednesday, Reuters reported that the agency had granted oil major Exxon Mobil Corp a hardship waiver, temporarily freeing its Montana refinery from U.S. biofuel laws, the latest in a number of waivers secured by big oil firms such as Chevron and Andeavor.

2018-12-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil Corp has withdrawn its WCC liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal in Canada from the environmental assessment process, it said on Thursday, signaling that the project has been shelved. The decision to pare its LNG project portfolio follows the go-ahead of a giant Royal Dutch Shell-led project in British Columbia, and Exxon’s focus on LNG projects in Asia, the Middle East and the United States.  Global LNG demand is expected to double to 550 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by 2030, as countries like China move away from coal to cleaner fuels. The top import market for LNG is northeast Asia. Exxon’s West Coast Canada (WCC) LNG export project, located in northern British Columbia, was expected to produce around 15 million tonnes per year of LNG to serve Asian buyers, with plans for further expansion up to 30 million tonnes per year.     The project was being jointly reviewed by the province and Canadian environmental regulators, an assessment that had been underway since 2015, though no major documents have been filed since 2016. Exxon formally withdrew from the process in a Dec. 5 letter to the British Columbia Environmental Assessment Office, posted on the regulator’s website.  “After careful review, ExxonMobil and Imperial (Oil Resources Ltd) have withdrawn the WCC LNG project from the environmental assessment process,” a spokeswoman for ExxonMobil confirmed in an email. Exxon’s decision signaled it is concentrating on LNG projects with Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] and a proposed expansion of its chilled-gas operation in Papua New Guinea, said Jason Feer, head of business intelligence at Poten & Partners, LNG tanker brokers and consultants.  “They have got a pretty robust pipeline of liquefaction projects globally. It would be natural to review that and see which would be competitive,” he said.  Exxon has been “taking advantage of opportunities as they become available to invest, restructure or divest assets to strengthen our long-term competitive position and provide the highest return to shareholders,” said spokeswoman Julie King.  LNG demand is growing but environmental groups say exports will boost carbon emissions in Canada, both through gas extraction and the liquefaction process. The WCC LNG export project planned to have liquefaction and storage facilities for natural gas, loading facilities and a third-party pipeline.  Exxon’s shares were off 3.12 percent at $68.57 apiece, the lowest since August 2015.

The Fed’s move on Wednesday to largely adhere to its plan for additional rate hikes over the next two years raised worries for market participants from Asia to Europe, as major indexes fell to their lowest in two years and investors flocked to the relative safety of government debt. European shares fell nearly 1.5 percent, with benchmark indexes in Germany, Britain and France all hitting their lowest since late 2016. Indexes in Japan and South Korea fell into a bear market, defined as a 20 percent decline from recent highs, joining benchmark indexes in Shanghai and Hong Kong. MSCI’s global equity index fell to its lowest since May 2017, shedding nearly 1.3 percent as it headed for a fifth straight day of losses. “All people are talking about today is the aftermath of the Fed hike. The fact that the Fed just killed the notion that they are here to backstop the market,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 387.43 points, or 1.66 percent, to 22,936.23, the S&P 500 lost 33.85 points, or 1.35 percent, to 2,473.11 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 106.94 points, or 1.61 percent, to 6,529.88. The Fed on Wednesday stuck by a plan to keep withdrawing support from an economy it considers robust, and hiked key overnight lending rates as expected by 0.25 percentage point. It said “some further gradual” rate hikes would be needed in the year ahead, with policymakers projecting two rises on average next year instead of the three predicted in September. Although largely in line with expectations, that tweak did little to soothe investor concerns over slowing world growth, U.S. trade tensions with China, and tightening monetary conditions for companies in the world’s biggest economy. “It appears that risky asset markets wanted a stronger ‘put’ from the Fed given the ongoing recession obsession taking over the market sentiment,” said Salman Ahmed, global investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. The equity losses added to the worst year for world stocks since the 2008 global financial crisis, with MSCI’s 47-country world stocks index down 10 percent. Nearly $7 trillion has been wiped off global stock markets this year, with emerging markets trampled flat by a charging dollar. The angst in equity markets pushed investors towards the safety of government bonds. German 10-year government bond yields, the euro zone benchmark, fell to their lowest in nearly seven months. Other high grade euro zone bond yields also fell. Benchmark 10-year U.S. notes last rose 1/32 in price to yield 2.7726 percent, from 2.776 percent late on Wednesday. Oil prices, meanwhile, slumped as worries about oversupply and worldwide demand for energy pushed prices back towards their lowest in over a year. U.S. crude fell more than 4 percent to $46.14 per barrel, while Brent fell 4.1 percent to $54.87 per barrel. “Growth concerns continue to percolate in the background, and you can see that with oil prices coming off,” said Alvin Tan, an foreign exchange strategist at Societe Generale. The dollar index fell 0.7 percent, with the euro up 0.74 percent to $1.1459.

2018-12-20,"Dec 20 (Reuters) - Changes in the North American generation mix from coal and nuclear to natural gas and renewables could threaten power system reliability in some areas over the next decade, the organization responsible for the region’s grid said on Thursday. But the electric industry has time to address reliability concerns before they become actual problems that affect consumers, the North American Electric Reliability Corp (NERC) said in a long-term assessment. “With proper planning and considerations that address the changing characteristics of our generation supply, industry will successfully navigate the unique set of reliability challenges that flow from an evolving resource mix,” John Moura, director of Reliability Assessment at NERC, said in a release. This is the second report by NERC this week that could help the Trump administration justify its plan to subsidize continued operation of coal and nuclear plants, which are being hurt by low gas prices and growing use of renewables. U.S. President Donald Trump has been advocating for steps to stem a surge in coal and nuclear retirements in recent years, arguing that more shutdowns would leave the country less able to bounce back from disruptions caused by storms, physical attacks, and hackers. For a factbox on coal and nuclear retirements see: Earlier this week, NERC said new pipelines and power lines would be required to meet electric demands if there are large-scale retirements of coal and nuclear plants. In its latest assessment, NERC said Texas, the U.S. Midwest and Ontario need more generation resources to avoid the risk of below target reserve margins over the next five years. The reserve margin is the difference between total generation available and forecasted peak demand. As reliance on gas-fired generation increases in some areas, like New York and New England, market operators and policymakers are already developing fuel assurance mechanisms to mitigate supply disruptions caused by limited gas pipeline capacity and other factors, NERC said. A total of 41,000 megawatts of new gas-fired generation is planned through 2028, NERC said. One megawatt is enough to power about 1,000 U.S. homes. In Florida, Texas and California, gas-fired plants are projected to account for more than 60 percent of generation used during the day. For states like California with lots of solar power, NERC recommended grid operators have enough flexible resources like gas-fired turbines that can ramp up quickly in case the sun stops shining over a large area.

2018-12-20,"(Adds details from the press conference) By José Roberto Gomes SAO PAULO, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Crushing in Brazil’s main sugarcane producing region for the 2019-20 season should roughly match this year’s production, as planted area shrinks but yields improve, analysts said on Thursday. For the current 2018-19 season, which ends in December, mills in the center-south region are expected to crush roughly 570 million tonnes of sugarcane, according to Antonio de Padua Rodrigues, the director of industry group Unica. That represents a decline of roughly 4 percent from the 2017-18 season. But Unica predicts that crushing will stabilize in 2019-20, matching the current season’s level. Rodrigues declined to give an exact prediction for sugarcane processing next year, cautioning it is still early to make a precise forecast. By mid-December, the amount of sugarcane processed in the center-south of Brazil had stood at 556.8 million tonnes, according to the industry group. The 2019-20 season will continue to be “very alcoholic” with millers continuing to direct a majority of the cane to producing ethanol due to the fuel’s relative price advantage over sugar, Rodrigues said. Some 65 percent of the center-south cane was directed to ethanol production in 2018, Unica data showed. Yields next season could increase 0.5 tonne per hectare as the average age of cane fields will fall from 3.72 years to 3.66 years, said Luiz Antonio Dias Paes, market and business director at sugarcane group Centro de Tecnologia Canavieira SA (CTC) . That would offset an expected decrease in planted area of around 1 percent, as some farmers switch to grains, Paes said. “So far, all is going well. If we have a normal summer, the expectation is that sugarcane yields will grow,” Paes said.

2018-12-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - British North Sea-focused oil and gas producers, Oranje-Nassau Energie (ONE) and Dyas, have agreed to merge to expand production, the privately-owned companies said on Thursday. The merged group, ONE-Dyas, will operate alongside a group of several relatively large independent oil producers that entered the North Sea in recent years, including private equity-backed Chrysaor and Neptune. The tie-up will enable ONE-Dyas “to pursue further growth opportunities,” according to the statement. The two Netherlands-based firms expect to have a joint production in 2019 of 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed), they said. Dyas holds stakes in several major British North Sea fields including Nexen-operated Buzzard, Premier Oil-operated (PMO.L) Catcher and Total-operated (TOTF.PA) Elgin Franklin. ONE also holds stakes in Buzzard, Elgin Franklin and Breagh. The company will be led by Robert Baurdoux, the current Chief Executive Officer of Dyas while ONE’s current CEO Alexander Berger will act as executive director. Under the agreement, ONE will own 51 percent of the shares in the combined group while SHV Holdings, Dyas’s parent company, will hold the remaining 49 percent. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2019. The two had a combined production of over 40,000 boed in 2017, according to their websites.

2018-12-20,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Ministers from European Union countries agreed on Thursday to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from trucks and buses by 30 percent by 2030, albeit with the potential to review this in 2022, the EU’s Austrian presidency said. Environment ministers struck the deal, balancing the interests of Germany and the continent’s largest auto sector with other countries, such as Sweden, which pushed for a sharper cut.  The countries, collectively known as the Council, will still have to negotiate next year with the European Parliament, which envisages a tougher 2030 target of a 35 percent cut. The government representatives also agreed on Thursday to an interim target of a 15 percent reduction by 2025, relative to 2019 levels. The parliament is pushing for 20 percent. The EU currently has no limits on emissions from heavy-duty vehicles, unlike other countries such as the United States, China, Japan and Canada. Trucks account for almost one quarter of the bloc’s transport-related emissions. Curbs on the transport sector, the only one in which emissions are still rising, aim to help the bloc meet its overall goal of reducing greenhouse gases by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 under the Paris climate accord. The EU agreed on Monday on targets for cutting emissions from cars and vans. The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) has lobbied for far lower reduction targets for trucks of 7 percent by 2025 and 16 percent by 2030. ACEA has said that the potential for electrifying truck fleets is far lower than for cars and that it would only really work for short trips within cities, but not for long-haul transit.  Volkswagen’s (VW) (VOWG_p.DE) truck brand MAN has warned the new CO2 limits could cost tens of thousands of jobs. Germany is home to the largest truck producer, Daimler.

2018-12-20,"* Uganda says tax on sale about $167 million * Tullow says deal should not attract substantial taxes * Uganda says plans licensing round in 2020 (Adds Tullow comment) By Elias Biryabarema KAMPALA, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Uganda’s energy minister said on Thursday she had given Tullow Oil conditional approval to sell part of its stake in Ugandan oilfields to France’s Total and China’s CNOOC but only after $167 million of tax on the deal is paid. London-listed Tullow agreed early last year to sell Total most of its stake in Ugandan fields for $900 million but CNOOC later exercised its pre-emption rights to buy half of the Tullow assets on sale. “I gave conditional consent for this transaction, subject to payment of tax obligations, as assessed by the Uganda Revenue Authority of about $167 million,” Energy Minister Irene Muloni told a news conference. The three firms currently each hold a 33.3 percent stake in the fields and Tullow is now selling 21.5 percent of its stake, which will be split equally between Total and CNOOC. Tullow spokesman George Cazenove said in an emailed statement Tullow believed it should not have to pay the assessed Ugandan tax. “As Tullow has stated on a number of occasions, we believe that this deal should not attract substantial tax liabilities and that this position is supported by Uganda’s tax laws,” he said. “Tullow and its partners remain in discussions with the Government of Uganda on this matter and the deal will only complete when those negotiations are brought to a satisfactory conclusion.” Muloni said after the deal is finalised, Tullow would be a non-operator and Total would be the operator in the northern part of License Area 2, while CNOOC Uganda would be the operator of the southern part of the area. “Given the above progress, we now expect the licensed companies to undertake the final investment decision for the upstream projects before June 2019,” she said. Uganda discovered commercial crude oil deposits in the west of the country near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo more than 10 years ago. The start of commercial production has been repeatedly delayed due to a lack of required infrastructure such as a refinery and an export pipeline. The government said last month that it now expects oil production to start in 2021, a year later than previously expected. Muloni said the government also planned to do another licensing round for vacant blocks in 2020, but the number of blocks that would be auctioned has yet to be determined. Muloni said Uganda’s gross crude reserves had also been revised downwards after new reservoir analyses, to 6 billion barrels from 6.5 billion previously. Recoverable reserves remained at 1.4 billion barrels. Ugandan fields also held 500 billion cubic feet of natural gas, she said. The oil firms are expected to spend between $15 billion and $20 billion to develop Ugandan fields and the associated infrastructure and the East African country is banking on that investment and potential proceeds from crude exports of about 200,000 barrels per day to drive growth.

Nearly $7 trillion has been wiped off world stocks, emerging markets have been trampled flat by a charging dollar and even gold and U.S. government bonds have lost money. A grisly combination of U.S.-China trade tensions, central banks turning off the money taps and cooling growth in former hot spots has wiped 10 percent off MSCI’s 47-country world stocks index — its first double-digit loss in any year since the 2008 global financial crisis. Many places have fared far worse. Top Chinese shares have fallen 25 percent into ‘bear’ territory, export bellwether Germany has shed 16 percent, and Turkey and Argentina have led emerging markets losses, down 45 and 50 percent respectively. Add in a wild 35 percent plunge in oil prices since September, rises in Italian, Greek and now French borrowing costs that show euro zone worries remain alive, and a full scale cryptocurrency collapse, and it has been unequivocally brutal. “After 10 years of low interest rates and quantitative easing I think we have to understand how some of this leverage in the market can unwind,” said Allianz Global Investors fund manager and global strategist Neil Dwane. “What was a virtuous circle on the way up can become a vicious one on the way down.” A fair bit of the year’s pain has stemmed from swift move up in U.S. interest rates and a pumped-up dollar, which has had its best year in three years. As a result, the euro, pound, Canadian and Aussie dollars and Swedish crown have all lost between 5 and 10 percent and though the Japanese yen comes out largely unscathed, emerging markets certainly haven’t. Argentina’s peso and Turkey’s lira have slumped 50 and 30 percent, while India’s rupee, South Africa’s rand, Brazil’s real and Russia’s rouble are all down between 10 to 15 percent. China’s yuan is in the red for a fourth year in five. Emerging market shares meanwhile have haemorrhaged almost 17 percent and JP Morgan's EM local currency bond index has lost nearly 8 percent. tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh Dalton Investments emerging market portfolio manager Pedro Zevallos said the big falls meant many markets, including China were now cheap. “But right now it honestly feels like catching a falling knife.” “And my concern going into next year is that the dollar will continue to strengthen.” As well as the escalation in global trade tensions this year there has been the realisation among investors that the big central banks aren’t thinking about stimulating the economy anymore — they’re trying to rebuild their arsenals in case of recession. But the year hasn’t been a complete write-off everywhere. While the S&P 500 and Dow Wall Street bellwethers are down the most since 2008, at around 5 percent their losses aren’t too bad, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is clinging on for its 10th consecutive year of gains. The FAANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) have had rollercoaster year. As a group, they are ending 2018 worth roughly $2.8 trillion — more or less where they started it, but down some $800 billion or 24 percent from their late August peak. There has been a big parting of the ways too. While Amazon and Netflix have surged 33 and 45 percent, repeated scandals over data misuse and fake news propagation have slashed 19 percent off Facebook shares. Asia’s equivalent BAT group, made up of Badia, Alibaba and Tencent, have all down somewhere between 18 and 25 percent. With China also the biggest consumer of industrial commodities, its misfiring economy has contributed to the respective 17 and 23 percent declines in the price of copper and zinc, used in things like pipes and galvanised steel. The big cryptocollapse has seen Bitcoin crash 72 percent. There are now over 2,000 other digital currencies in circulation but their value has plummeted to $128 billion from over $800 billion in January. But even traditional safe-havens have failed to provide much in the way of protection. Another four U.S. interest hikes have cost Treasury bond holders nearly 2 percent despite a better last few months and the euro’s fall puts German Bunds down 2.3 percent in dollar terms. Gold is 4 percent less precious. Italy’s government bonds meanwhile have plunged 9 percent after an anti-establishment government took charge in Rome and the European Central Bank confirmed its huge bond-buying programme will end this year. “The question as we look into 2019 and 2020 is how much worse the trade/tech cold war and Brexit get,” Allianz’s Dwayne said. “That could tells us that maybe we are not going to see a traditional downturn but a significant one.” Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Catherine Evans",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-markets-2018/rpt-graphic-markets-suffer-worst-year-since-global-financial-crisis-idUKL8N1YP2H3,20 Dec 2018,"Traders will be glad to see the

2018-12-20,"(Repeast earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Forecasting the year-ahead outlook for commodities, while popular among analysts, is a bit of a mug’s game at the best of times, but the view for 2019 is made even more complicated by one volatile factor: Donald Trump. While there are other drivers of commodity prices next year, the mercurial U.S. president looms large over the sector, and the actions of his administration will either amplify or partially nullify the established trends. Before trying to decipher Trump’s likely actions it’s worth looking at the trends likely to move commodity markets in 2019. Chief among these is increasing concern about slower global economic growth, with particular worries over China, the world’s second-largest economy and the biggest importer of commodities. There are roughly two schools of thought on China, the first being that the country will have to endure lower growth and tighter credit conditions as it struggles to overcome U.S. tariffs on its exports and slower growth in other trading partners. The second is that once again Beijing will successfully manage to open the spending taps and the subsequent raft of infrastructure and construction projects will keep commodity demand healthy and economic growth above the 6 percent level. The second scenario would be supportive for imports, and prices, for bulk commodities such as iron ore and coal, and for industrial metals, most notably copper. However, it’s also worth noting that much of what Beijing is likely to do is dependent on how its trade dispute with the United States unfolds. Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping appeared to reach some sort of detente at the recent G20 meeting in Argentina, but it’s still an open question as to whether this can morph into an agreement acceptable to both sides. The pattern of the dispute so far has been dictated by Trump, who has alternated between ramping up rhetoric and calming it down, which does little more than create opportunities for volatility traders. The real question to be answered is whether both China and the United States are prepared to weather the pain of an extended trade dispute. It’s likely to be the case that the country upon which the most tariffs are imposed, in this case China, will feel the economic cost first. But the United States will also eventually feel the fallout through higher costs of goods, rising inflation, lower consumer spending and a loss of competitiveness in industries no longer exposed to international rivals. How these dynamics play out largely depend on Trump’s actions. The U.S. leader may come under increasing pressure from within his Republican Party to reach an accommodation with China if the economy starts to slow and the equity markets continue their recent downward trend. Trump has staked much of his presidency’s success on delivering a strong economy with high returns for investors, and if this is challenged it may force him to seek ways to maintain economic momentum. However, Trump is also likely to be distracted by his mounting legal difficulties and by the takeover of the House of Representatives by the Democratic Party. The threat of legal action and further investigations into his affairs, as well as his friendliness toward Saudi Arabia and Russia, also are a major factor likely to influence crude oil. The Trump administration effectively kicked the can on its re-imposition of sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme down the road until April, when the import waivers granted to Tehran’s biggest customers are set to expire. This is likely to ignite debate over whether the crude oil market will tighten if Trump does end the waivers allowing Iran to export, or whether U.S. shale output will be enough to keep the market in surplus. The interplay between Trump, embattled Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Russian strong man Vladimir Putin will also be key for the actions taken by the world’s three largest oil producers. The trouble for analysts is that there is no way to be certain how all the factors around Trump will develop. His legal woes may amount to little, or they may lead to his impeachment and removal from office. Trump may reach a deal with China that ends the tariff war, or he may not and it could escalate. He may really crack down on Iran’s oil exports, or he may not. In some ways, commodity markets have become unwitting hostages to the man likely to be regarded as the most controversial political leader of his time.

2018-12-20,"* Europe indexes fall to lowest in two years * Oil falls 4 percent * Tokyo, Seoul bourses join Chinese benchmarks in bear market * Fed seen less dovish than hoped (Updates prices, adds strategist comment) By Tom Wilson LONDON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - World equity markets slipped on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve dashed investor hopes of a more dovish policy outlook, worsening worries of a recession as signs grow that global economic growth is stuttering. Jitters over the Fed’s move to largely keep guidance for additional hikes over the next two years spread from Asia to Europe, where major indexes fell to their lowest in two years and investors flocked to the relative safety of government debt. European shares fell 0.9 percent, with bourses in Germany, Britain and France all hitting their lowest levels since late 2016. MSCI’s global equity index fell to its lowest since May 2017, shedding as much as 0.7 percent as it headed for a fifth straight day of losses. By midday GMT it was down 0.3 percent. The Fed on Wednesday stuck by a plan to keep withdrawing support from an economy it views as strong, hiking key overnight lending rates, as expected, by 0.25 percent points. It said “some further gradual” rate hikes would be needed in the year ahead, with policymakers projecting two rises on average next year instead of the three predicted in September. Although largely in line with expectations, that tweak failed to soothe a cocktail of market fears over slowing world growth, U.S. trade tensions with China, and tightening monetary conditions for companies in the world’s biggest economy. In Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.8 percent. Indexes in Japan and South Korea fell into a bear market, defined as a 20 percent decline from the highest point of the last year, joining bourses in Shanghai and Hong Kong. “It appears that risky asset markets wanted a stronger ‘put’ from the Fed given the ongoing recession obsession taking over the market sentiment,” said Salman Ahmed, global investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. The angst in equity markets saw investors flock towards the safety of government bonds. German 10-year government bond yields, the euro zone benchmark, fell to their lowest in nearly seven months. Other high grade euro zone bond yields also fell. Bund yields followed those of U.S. Treasuries, which sank to more than eight-month lows. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield had earlier fallen as low as 2.750 percent, a level last seen in early April. Oil prices, meanwhile, slumped by more than 4 percent as worries about oversupply and worldwide demand for energy pushed prices back towards their lowest levels in over a year. “Growth concerns continue to percolate in the background, and you can see that with oil prices coming off - that’s a macro story,” said Alvin Tan, an foreign exchange strategist at Societe Generale. “You can see this in the U.S. yield curve flattening even further after the Fed.” The rise in short-term interest rates and a fall in yields of long-dated bonds rekindled worries of an inversion between short-yield bonds and 10-year yields - historically a fairly reliable indicator that a recession is brewing. The two-year U.S. yield stood at 2.656 percent, just 0.097 percent less than the 10-year yield. The equity losses added to the worst year for world stocks since the 2008 global financial crisis, with MSCI’s 47-country world stocks index down 10 percent. Nearly $7 trillion has been wiped off world stocks this year, with emerging markets trampled flat by a charging dollar. Still, the dollar fell against major currencies after the Fed’s decision to a one-month low, losing ground because of perceptions of a more hawkish position than anticipated. The greenback fell 0.8 percent against its rivals to 96.258. On a daily basis, it is set for the biggest percentage drop in six weeks. The euro gained 0.8 percent to $1.1472, boosted by news that Italy had struck a deal with the European Commission over its contested 2019 budget and some solid trade data this week. In other announcements by central banks, Japan kept its policy settings unchanged, as expected. Britain also kept rates steady, while Sweden raised rates for the first time in over seven years, pushing its currency up against the dollar.

2018-12-20,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Oil producer group OPEC plans to release a table detailing output cut quotas for its members and allies such as Russia in an effort to shore up the price of crude, OPEC’s secretary-general said in a letter seen by Reuters on Thursday.  Mohammad Barkindo said to reach the proposed cut of 1.2 million barrels per day, the effective reduction for member countries was 3.02 percent.  That is higher than the initially discussed 2.5 percent as OPEC seeks to accommodate Iran, Libya and Venezuela, which are exempt from any requirement to cut. He commended Saudi Arabia for pledging to cut to 10.2 million barrels per day from January, a deeper reduction than allocated. Sources had initially said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would not publish individual quotas. “In the interests of openness and transparency, and to support market sentiment and confidence, it is vital to make these production adjustments publicly available,” Barkindo told members in the letter. “I would urge Your Excellencies to kindly make positive announcements reinstating your countries’ commitment to implementing the agreed decisions. This is also vital to underpin trust in our decisions and to buttress ourselves from any naysayers who may doubt our commitment.” The OPEC secretariat plans to publish the table below by the end of this week, he added.

2018-12-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - Traders will be glad to see the back of 2018. Nearly $7 trillion has been wiped off world stocks, emerging markets have been trampled flat by a charging dollar and even gold and U.S. government bonds have lost money. A grisly combination of U.S.-China trade tensions, central banks turning off the money taps and cooling growth in former hot spots has wiped 10 percent off MSCI’s 47-country world stocks index — its first double-digit loss in any year since the 2008 global financial crisis. Many places have fared far worse. Top Chinese shares .CSI300 have fallen 25 percent into 'bear' territory, export bellwether Germany .GDAXI has shed 16 percent, and Turkey and Argentina have led emerging markets losses, down 45 and 50 percent respectively. Add in a wild 35 percent plunge in oil prices since September, rises in Italian, Greek and now French borrowing costs that show euro zone worries remain alive, and a full scale cryptocurrency collapse, and it has been unequivocally brutal. “After 10 years of low interest rates and quantitative easing I think we have to understand how some of this leverage in the market can unwind,” said Allianz Global Investors fund manager and global strategist Neil Dwane. “What was a virtuous circle on the way up can become a vicious one on the way down.” A fair bit of the year’s pain has stemmed from swift move up in U.S. interest rates and a pumped-up dollar .DXY, which has had its best year in three years. As a result, the euro EUR=, pound GBP=, Canadian and Aussie dollars CAD=AUD= and Swedish crown SEK= have all lost between 5 and 10 percent and though the Japanese yen JPY= comes out largely unscathed, emerging markets certainly haven't. Argentina's peso ARS= and Turkey's lira TRY= have slumped 50 and 30 percent, while India's rupee IDR=, South Africa's rand ZAR=, Brazil's real BRL= and Russia's rouble RUB= are all down between 10 to 15 percent. China's yuan is in the red for a fourth year in five. Emerging market shares meanwhile have haemorrhaged almost 17 percent and JP Morgan’s EM local currency bond index has lost nearly 8 percent.  Dalton Investments emerging market portfolio manager Pedro Zevallos said the big falls meant many markets, including China were now cheap. “But right now it honestly feels like catching a falling knife.” “And my concern going into next year is that the dollar will continue to strengthen.”  As well as the escalation in global trade tensions this year there has been the realisation among investors that the big central banks aren’t thinking about stimulating the economy anymore — they’re trying to rebuild their arsenals in case of recession. But the year hasn’t been a complete write-off everywhere. While the S&P 500 and Dow Wall Street bellwethers are down the most since 2008, at around 5 percent their losses aren’t too bad, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is clinging on for its 10th consecutive year of gains. The FAANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) have had rollercoaster year. As a group, they are ending 2018 worth roughly $2.8 trillion — more or less where they started it, but down some $800 billion or 24 percent from their late August peak. There has been a big parting of the ways too. While Amazon (AMZN.O) and Netflix (NFLX.O) have surged 33 and 45 percent, repeated scandals over data misuse and fake news propagation have slashed 19 percent off Facebook (FB.O) shares. Asia’s equivalent BAT group, made up of Badia (600865.SS), Alibaba (BABA.K) and Tencent (0700.HK), have all down somewhere between 18 and 25 percent.  With China also the biggest consumer of industrial commodities, its misfiring economy has contributed to the respective 17 and 23 percent declines in the price of copper and zinc, used in things like pipes and galvanised steel. The big cryptocollapse has seen Bitcoin BTC=BTSP crash 72 percent. There are now over 2,000 other digital currencies in circulation but their value has plummeted to $128 billion from over $800 billion in January. But even traditional safe-havens have failed to provide much in the way of protection. Another four U.S. interest hikes have cost Treasury bond holders nearly 2 percent despite a better last few months and the euro’s fall puts German Bunds down 2.3 percent in dollar terms. Gold is 4 percent less precious. Italy’s government bonds meanwhile have plunged 9 percent after an anti-establishment government took charge in Rome and the European Central Bank confirmed its huge bond-buying programme will end this year. “The question as we look into 2019 and 2020 is how much worse the trade/tech cold war and Brexit get,” Allianz’s Dwayne said. “That could tells us that maybe we are not going to see a traditional downturn but a significant one.”  Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Catherine Evans",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-markets-2018/graphic-markets-suffer-worst-year-since-global-financial-crisis-idUKL8N1YO5N9,20 Dec 2018,"Traders will be glad to see the

It said “some further” rate hikes would be necessary in the year ahead, with policymakers projecting two rises on average next year instead of the three predicted in September, a change largely in line with expectations. But that minor revision could not soothe market fears over a further U.S. economic slowdown on the back of trade tensions with China, a waning boost from tax cuts and tightening monetary conditions for companies. “It appears that risky asset markets wanted a stronger ‘put’ from the Fed given the ongoing recession obsession taking over the market sentiment,” said Salman Ahmed, global investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. Oil prices fell more than 3 percent, erasing most of their gains from the day before and heading back towards their lowest levels for more than a year amid worries about oversupply and the outlook for the global economy. In Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had earlier dropped 1 percent and Japan’s Topix joined Shanghai and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng in bear market territory, defined as down more than 20 percent from recent high.

The two-year U.S. yield stood at 2.656 percent, just 0.097 percent less than the 10-year yield. The dollar fell against major currencies, losing ground after perceptions the Fed was more hawkish than anticipated. The dollar fell 0.4 percent against its rivals to 96.68 and within a whisker of a 9-day low of 96.554 hit in the previous session. “The impact of (the Fed’s) decision, especially for foreign countries, depends on how much the dollar will go up,” former ECB vice president Vitor Constancio said. The euro gained 0.5 percent to $1.1429, slightly off a high of $1.14395 hit before the Fed’s policy announcement. In other announcements by central banks, Japan kept its policy settings unchanged, as expected. Sweden’s currency jumped more than one percent against the dollar on Thursday after the central bank raised interest rates for the first time in more than seven years. Britain is also due to make a policy announcement later in the day, with analysts expecting the Bank of England to keep rates steady. Reporting by Tom Wilson and Sujata Rao;

Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng expressed confidence in a “successful implementation” of a consensus reached at Dec. 1 talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Argentina. Gao said the two sides had been in close contact since then, including a vice-ministerial level call on Wednesday, when they went over arrangements for more talks and the issues of trade balances and the protection of intellectual property rights. “The two sides will arrange consultations including meetings and calls at any time as needed to promote the implementation of the consensus of the heads of state,” Gao told reporters in Beijing.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 1.1 percent, with Australian shares also declining 1.3 percent to a two-year closing low. Markets across the region are nearing gloomy milestones, with Japan’s Topix and South Korea’s KOSPI falling into a bear market, which means they are down more than 20 percent from their recent highs, to join Shanghai and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng. Financial spread-betters expect London’s FTSE Frankfurt’s DAX and Paris’s CAC to fall between 1.2 and 1.4 percent when they open. Japan’s Nikkei shed 2.8 percent to close at its lowest since September 2017. China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite and the blue-chip CSI 300 fell 0.5 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively, while the Hang Seng was off 1.1 percent. In New York, U.S. S&P 500 Index lost 1.54 percent to hit its lowest level since September 2017. U.S. stocks are on pace for their biggest December decline since 1931, the depths of the Great Depression. “I think the Fed may be underestimating other factors at play,” said Bob Baur, chief global economist at Principal Global Investors in Des Moines, Iowa in the Unites States. “Trade has been making headlines, but I think a gradual tightening of monetary policy has been the driving force behind recent market volatility. With corporate borrowing and spending still high, and the Fed continuing to reduce its balance sheet, I’d expect volatility to remain if this tightening continues,” he said. The Fed raised key overnight lending rate rates by 0.25 percent point as expected to a range of 2.25 percent to 2.50 percent. It said “some further” rate hikes would be necessary in the year ahead, with its policymakers projecting two rate hikes on average next year instead of three they saw back in September, a change that was also largely in line with expectations. But the slight revision was not enough to ease market fears over a further U.S. economic slowdown on the back of trade tensions, a waning boost from tax cuts and tightening monetary conditions for companies. U.S. junk bonds sold off sharply, with their ETFs falling 0.9 percent, the biggest decline since March 1. As investors flocked to the safety of government bonds, the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell to as low as 2.748 percent, a level last seen in early April. A rise in short-term interest rates and a fall in the long-dated yield rekindled worries of an inversion in the yield curve, where shorter-debt yields become higher than longer-term ones. Historically, an inversion between short-yields, such as three-month and two-year yields, and 10-year yields has been seen as a fairly reliable indicator of a recession down the road. “We expect additional rate hikes will invert the three-months to 10-year yield curve which is a reliable signal for a bear market for stocks and a coming recession for both the U.S. and the rest of the world,” said Jeffrey Kleintop, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab in Boston. “So, seriously something to keep a close eye on. We do expect a very difficult year for investors.” The two-year U.S. yield stood at 2.654 percent, just 0.103 percentage point less than the 10-year yield. As one 25 basis point rate hike would likely invert the yield curve, many market players are sceptical whether the Fed can raise rates at all next year. Fed funds futures are now pricing in only about a 50 percent chance of one rate hike. The dollar initially gained as the Fed was seen as more hawkish but it lost steam against other safe-haven currencies, such as the yen. The greenback slipped 0.6 percent to its 7-1/2-week low of 111.865, while the euro also gained a tad to $1.1397 . The Chinese yuan weakened after China’s central bank introduced a targeted lending measure on Thursday to support growth in a slowing economy. The onshore yuan was trading at 6.902 per dollar, 0.1 percent weaker on the day, having earlier weakened to 6.915 per dollar. On Thursday, Japan kept its policy settings unchanged, as expected. Later in the day, UK and Sweden will make policy announcements.

2018-12-20,"(Reuters) - U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export capacity is on the brink of doubling in 2019, which will boost the super-cooled fuel’s influence on the U.S. natural gas market, where volatility surged in 2018 after several years of slumber. LNG exports have been the fastest growing source of U.S. natural gas demand since the country started ramping up exports in 2016, and is expected to expand deliveries in coming years as several more export terminals enter service. Its imprint is being felt in the U.S. gas futures NGc1 market, which in November experienced its longest stretch of extreme volatility in nine years due to demand, low inventories and unseasonably cold U.S. weather. LNG currently accounts for just a small amount of overall domestic gas demand. But as the country opens more facilities for export to meet growing needs abroad, analysts said more ups and downs in prices are expected. “As LNG exports increase, so will future gas prices,” said Tom DiCapua, managing director of wholesale energy services at Con Edison Energy, a provider of energy management services, including the purchase of gas, for power plants owned by several companies. Prices at the U.S. Henry Hub benchmark in Louisiana hit $4.929 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in November - their highest in four-and-a-half years. That was also well above the five-year average from 2013-17 of $3.25/mmBtu. The United States is on track to export about a trillion cubic feet of LNG by year-end, or about 3 percent of overall U.S. gas demand in 2018.  But LNG exports are expected to rise to 5 percent of overall U.S. gas demand in 2019 and to 10 percent in 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), boosting LNG’s potential to affect prices. “LNG exports will be one of the most bullish demand factors for U.S. natural gas prices over the coming two years, when several terminals are set to come online,” Raymond James analyst Muhammed Ghulam said. There are three LNG export terminals presently in operation in the United States. Those include Corpus Christi in Texas, which shipped its first cargo in December. Three more terminals are expected to enter service in 2019, boosting U.S. LNG export capacity to 8.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas, making it third largest in the world behind Australia and Qatar.  U.S. production is expected to rise 11 percent to a record 83.3 bcfd in 2018, the biggest year-over-year increase since 1951, according to EIA projections. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. Investment decisions are imminent on another three U.S. Gulf Coast projects worth an estimated $20 billion, in 2019, while several other facilities are in the planning stages in the Pacific Northwest. “The first half of 2019 will be an especially busy one for the U.S.,” said Alex Munton, Americas LNG analyst at energy consultant Wood Mackenzie. Some consumers say there may not be enough gas production and pipeline capacity to support growing domestic markets in addition to LNG exports. “Pressure on U.S. gas prices at peak demand mounts with every additional LNG export,” said Paul Cicio, president of Industrial Energy Consumers of America, an industry lobby group. He said the United States should not approve new LNG export terminals until the government determines the country can first meet domestic demand. Houston-based Cheniere Energy Inc (LNG.A), the biggest U.S. buyer of natural gas, said its LNG exports are not causing market volatility. “Cheniere’s demand is not variable, it is steady,” Cheniere spokesman Eben Burnham-Snyder said. “We’ve encouraged more natural gas production and pipeline development in basins all across the country because of our consistent demand for natural gas.” Reporting by Scott DiSavino; editing by David Gaffen, G Crosse",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-lng-prices/analysis-rising-lng-demand-to-exert-more-pull-on-u-s-natgas-prices-idUKL1N1Y91D9,20 Dec 2018,"U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export

2018-12-20,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - Forecasting the year-ahead outlook for commodities, while popular among analysts, is a bit of a mug’s game at the best of times, but the view for 2019 is made even more complicated by one volatile factor: Donald Trump. While there are other drivers of commodity prices next year, the mercurial U.S. president looms large over the sector, and the actions of his administration will either amplify or partially nullify the established trends. Before trying to decipher Trump’s likely actions it’s worth looking at the trends likely to move commodity markets in 2019. Chief among these is increasing concern about slower global economic growth, with particular worries over China, the world’s second-largest economy and the biggest importer of commodities. There are roughly two schools of thought on China, the first being that the country will have to endure lower growth and tighter credit conditions as it struggles to overcome U.S. tariffs on its exports and slower growth in other trading partners. The second is that once again Beijing will successfully manage to open the spending taps and the subsequent raft of infrastructure and construction projects will keep commodity demand healthy and economic growth above the 6 percent level. The second scenario would be supportive for imports, and prices, for bulk commodities such as iron ore and coal, and for industrial metals, most notably copper. However, it’s also worth noting that much of what Beijing is likely to do is dependent on how its trade dispute with the United States unfolds. Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping appeared to reach some sort of detente at the recent G20 meeting in Argentina, but it’s still an open question as to whether this can morph into an agreement acceptable to both sides. The pattern of the dispute so far has been dictated by Trump, who has alternated between ramping up rhetoric and calming it down, which does little more than create opportunities for volatility traders. The real question to be answered is whether both China and the United States are prepared to weather the pain of an extended trade dispute. It’s likely to be the case that the country upon which the most tariffs are imposed, in this case China, will feel the economic cost first. But the United States will also eventually feel the fallout through higher costs of goods, rising inflation, lower consumer spending and a loss of competitiveness in industries no longer exposed to international rivals. How these dynamics play out largely depend on Trump’s actions. The U.S. leader may come under increasing pressure from within his Republican Party to reach an accommodation with China if the economy starts to slow and the equity markets continue their recent downward trend. Trump has staked much of his presidency’s success on delivering a strong economy with high returns for investors, and if this is challenged it may force him to seek ways to maintain economic momentum. However, Trump is also likely to be distracted by his mounting legal difficulties and by the takeover of the House of Representatives by the Democratic Party. The threat of legal action and further investigations into his affairs, as well as his friendliness toward Saudi Arabia and Russia, also are a major factor likely to influence crude oil. The Trump administration effectively kicked the can on its re-imposition of sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme down the road until April, when the import waivers granted to Tehran’s biggest customers are set to expire. This is likely to ignite debate over whether the crude oil market will tighten if Trump does end the waivers allowing Iran to export, or whether U.S. shale output will be enough to keep the market in surplus. The interplay between Trump, embattled Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Russian strong man Vladimir Putin will also be key for the actions taken by the world’s three largest oil producers. The trouble for analysts is that there is no way to be certain how all the factors around Trump will develop. His legal woes may amount to little, or they may lead to his impeachment and removal from office. Trump may reach a deal with China that ends the tariff war, or he may not and it could escalate. He may really crack down on Iran’s oil exports, or he may not. In some ways, commodity markets have become unwitting hostages to the man likely to be regarded as the most controversial political leader of his time.

2018-12-20,"(Updates prices throughout) * S&P500 hits 15-month low, Fed seen less dovish than hoped * 10-year U.S. Treasury yields at lowest level since April * Topix, Kospi fall into bear market to join Chinese benchmarks * BOJ stands pat as expected By Hideyuki Sano and Tomo Uetake TOKYO, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Asian shares slid on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates, as expected, and kept most of its guidance for additional hikes next two years, dashing investor hopes for a more dovish policy outlook. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 1.4 percent, with Australian shares slipping as much as 1.3 percent to two-year lows. Markets across the region are nearing gloomy milestones, with Japan’s Topix and South Korea’s Kospi heading into a bear market, which means they are down more than 20 percent off their recent highs, to join Shanghai and Hong Kong’s Han Seng. Japan’s Nikkei shed 3.3 percent to fresh nine-month lows. China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite and the blue-chip CSI 300 fell 1.3 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was off 1.5 percent. In New York, U.S. S&P 500 Index lost 1.54 percent to hit its lowest level since September 2017. U.S. stocks are on pace for their biggest December decline since 1931, the depths of the Great Depression. “I think the Fed may be underestimating other factors at play,” said Bob Baur, chief global economist at Principal Global Investors in Des Moines, Iowa in the Unites States. “Trade has been making headlines, but I think a gradual tightening of monetary policy has been the driving force behind recent market volatility. With corporate borrowing and spending still high, and the Fed continuing to reduce its balance sheet, I’d expect volatility to remain if this tightening continues,” he said. The Fed raised key overnight lending rate rates by 0.25 percent point as expected to a range of 2.25 percent to 2.50 percent. It said “some further” rate hikes would be necessary in the year ahead, with its policymakers projecting two rate hikes on average next year instead of three they saw back in September, a change that was also largely in line with expectations. But the slight revision was not enough to ease market fears over a further U.S. economic slowdown on the back of trade tensions, a waning boost from tax cuts and tightening monetary conditions for companies. U.S. junk bonds sold off sharply, with their ETFs falling 0.9 percent, the biggest decline since March 1. As investors flocked to the safety of government bonds, the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell below its May 29 low of 2.759 percent to as low as 2.750 percent, a level last seen in early April. A rise in short-term interest rates and a fall in the long-date yield rekindled worries of an inversion in the yield curve, where shorter-debt yields become higher than longer-term ones. Historically, an inversion between short-yields, such as three-month and two-year yields, and 10-year yields has been seen as a fairly reliable indicator of a recession down the road. “We expect additional rate hikes will invert the three-months to 10-year yield curve which is a reliable signal for a bear market for stocks and a coming recession for both the U.S. and the rest of the world,” said Jeffrey Kleintop, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab in Boston. “So, seriously something to keep a close eye on. We do expect a very difficult year for investors.” The two-year U.S. yield stood at 2.656 percent, just 0.097 percent less than the 10-year yield. As one 25 basis point rate hike would likely invert the yield curve, many market players are sceptical whether the Fed can raise rates at all next year. Fed funds futures are now pricing in only about 50 percent chance of one rate hike. The dollar bounced back against major currencies after the Fed was perceived to be more hawkish than anticipated. The euro traded at $1.1383, off Wednesday’s high of $1.14395 hit before the Fed’s policy announcement. The dollar stood at 112.20 yen, slightly off the seven-week low of 112.09 touched just before the Fed. “Traders sold the dollar yesterday, on hopes today’s Fed would be even more dovish,” said Kengo Suzuki, chief FX strategist at Mizuho Securities. China’s yuan weakened in early Asian trade after the country’s central bank left its short-term borrowing rates unchanged on Thursday, choosing not to follow its U.S. counterpart. The yuan weakened past the 6.91-to-the-dollar level after the People’s Bank of China introduced a targeted lending measure to support growth in a slowing economy and last traded at 6.9079 per dollar, 0.2 percent softer on the day. On Thursday, Japan kept its policy settings unchanged, as expected. Later in the day, UK and Sweden will make policy announcements. Both are expected to keep their policies on hold, though the Swedish central bank’s decision is seen as a close call, with some analysts expecting a rate hike. Oil prices fell on Thursday to erase most of their gains from the day before, resuming declines seen earlier in the week amid worries about oversupply and the outlook for the global economy.

The front-month U.S. crude contract had fallen 78 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $47.39 per barrel by 0129 GMT, nearly offseting gains of 96 cents chalked up on Wednesday. International benchmark Brent crude futures were down 66 cents, or 1.2 percent, at $56.58 per barrel, after climbing almost 2 percent the session before. “Wednesday’s recovery was short-covering. Investors quickly moved their attention to deteriorating fundamentals in the oil markets including more signs of slowing economic growth next year, record production and the lack of confidence with OPEC’s pledge to curb production,” said Xi Jiarui, chief oil analyst at consultancy JLC. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers including Russia agreed this month to curb output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in an attempt to drain tanks and boost prices. Oil prices are down more than 30 percent from peaks seen in October. But the cuts will not happen until next month and production has been at or near record highs in the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Volatility in crude prices this week has driven investors to shut their positions and is draining liquidity from the market, Xi said. Total market open interest in U.S. crude contracts had fallen to 2.063 million contracts as of Thursday, up from a record of 2.71 million in May. “It has been a tumultuous week in oil markets and traders may opt to shut it down after the last big risk event of the year with year-end position-squaring likely to kick-in today,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at OANDA. Innes was referring to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting of 2018, at which it suggested the U.S. economy no longer needed the central bank’s support either through lower-than-normal interest rates or by maintaining a massive balance sheet. But U.S. inventory data offered some support to WTI prices. U.S. crude inventories fell by 497,000 barrels in the week to Dec. 14, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday, smaller than the decrease of 2.4 million barrels analysts had expected. The decline was the third consecutive decrease. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 4.2 million barrels, versus expectations of a 573,000-barrel increase, the EIA said. Distillate demand rose to the highest since January 2003, which bolstered buying, particularly in heating oil futures, the market’s proxy for diesel.
