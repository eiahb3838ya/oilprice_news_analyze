2018-09-28,"(Reuters) - California regulators on Friday voted to require that automakers stick with Obama-era federal vehicle emissions standards for cars sold in the state regardless of Trump administration efforts to weaken the standards. The move was the latest in running political clashes between the most populous U.S. state and President Donald Trump’s administration over issues running from climate change to immigration. The California Air Resources Board, the state’s air quality regulator, affirmed a provision in its greenhouse gas vehicle regulation that establishes that only cars meeting current federal standards for model years 2017 through 2025 comply with the state’s standards and can be sold there.  The vote took place at the board’s monthly meeting in Sacramento. The Trump administration proposed last month to freeze federal fuel efficiency requirements at 2020 levels through 2026. In that proposal, the administration said stricter emissions standards make vehicles more expensive and less safe. California’s position is nationally significant because the state is the largest U.S. auto market and boasts the nation’s most aggressive policies to address climate change.  Also, a dozen states and the District of Columbia have adopted California’s emissions rules, accounting for more than a third of all U.S. vehicle sales. California has long been allowed under a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency waiver to set its own, stricter vehicle emissions rules to fight heavy smog in Los Angeles and other urban areas. The Trump administration has proposed revoking that authority, something that could cast doubt on the state’s powers to sidestep federal standards. In a statement, CARB Chair Mary Nichols said the state would “continue to work to keep a single national program,” but that the vote “ensures that California and 12 other states will not fall victim to the Trump administration’s rollback of vehicle standards should its proposal be finalized.” Automakers have urged California and the administration to reach agreement, rather than face years of uncertainty. Automakers want looser emissions standards because consumers now favor bigger cars that use more fuel.

2018-09-28,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose on Friday as the euro fell on deepening worries about an Italian budget with a higher-than-expected deficit target, which also slammed European stocks. Wall Street ended flat, pulling back from early gains after Facebook disclosed a security breach. Tesla shares lost 13.9 percent after U.S. regulators sued Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk in a fraud complaint that seeks to remove him as CEO. In Italy, the government on Thursday targeted a budget deficit of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product for the next three years, marking a victory for party chiefs over Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, an unaffiliated technocrat. Although the deficit is within the prescribed EU limit of 3 percent of GDP, investors fear that Italy’s anti-establishment government is not committed to tackling its huge debt load.

2018-09-28,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose more than 1 percent on Friday, with Brent climbing to a four-year high, as U.S. sanctions on Tehran squeezed Iranian crude exports, tightening supply even as other key exporters increased production. Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose $1 to settle at $82.72 a barrel. The session high of $82.87 was the contract’s highest since Nov. 10, 2014. In the third quarter, Brent has gained about 4 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose $1.13 to settle at $73.25 a barrel. The session high of $73.73 was the highest since July 11. The contract is up about 5 percent this month but down around 1 percent for the quarter. A new round of U.S. sanctions on Iran, the No. 3 producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), kicks in on Nov. 4. “Potential for a supply shock because of declining oil production in Iran and Venezuela will remain bullish on oil prices, and the second round of U.S. sanctions on Iran in November will further support the sentiment,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy in London. Amid concerns about supply shortages, hedge funds raised their combined futures and options position in New York and London by 3,728 contracts to 346,566 in the week to Sept. 25, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said.  Washington is demanding that buyers of Iranian oil cut imports to zero to force Tehran to negotiate a new nuclear agreement and to curb its influence in the Middle East.  China’s Sinopec Corp is halving loadings of crude oil from Iran this month, as the state refiner comes under intense pressure from Washington, said people with knowledge of the matter. However, India, another top buyer, is committed to buying oil from Tehran, the Iranian foreign minister said. Other OPEC countries have been boosting production, but global inventories have still been falling, analysts said. Saudi Arabia is expected to add oil to the market to offset the drop in Iranian production. Two sources familiar with OPEC policy told Reuters Saudi Arabia and other OPEC and non-OPEC producers had discussed a possible production increase of about 500,000 barrels per day (bpd).  However, ANZ said in a note that major suppliers were unlikely to offset losses from sanctions, estimated at 1.5 million bpd. At its 2018 peak in May, Iran exported 2.71 million bpd, nearly 3 percent of daily global crude consumption. Looking to 2019, Saudi Arabia is concerned that rising U.S. shale production could create another glut, especially if a stronger dollar and weaker emerging market economies reduce global demand for oil, sources familiar with OPEC policy say. U.S. crude production rose 269,000 bpd to a record 10.964 million bpd in July, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report. However, drillers cut three oil rigs in the week to Sept. 28, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. New drilling has stalled in the third quarter with the fewest additions in a quarter since 2017 due to pipeline constraints in the nation’s largest oil field. The Permian Basin is forecast to produce 3.5 million bpd in October, just below output from Iran, OPEC’s third largest producer.

2018-09-28,"(Adds demand figures) NEW YORK, Sept 28 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil production rose 269,000 barrels per day (bpd) to a record 10.964 million bpd in July, led by record output from Texas and North Dakota, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report on Friday. The agency revised its June production figure slightly higher to 10.695 million bpd in June. U.S. crude production has surged thanks to a shale boom and now rivals top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia. Oil production in Russia averaged 11.347 million bpd between Sept. 1 and Sept. 27 and was on track to reach another post-Soviet high, an energy sector source told Reuters on Friday. Saudi Arabia meanwhile, produced about 10.4 million bpd in August. Saudi Arabia is concerned that rising U.S. shale production over the next year could create another glut, especially if a stronger dollar and weaker emerging market economies reduce global demand for oil. Production in Texas inched higher to a record 4.47 million bpd and output from North Dakota also hit a peak, rising by 41,000 bpd to 1.26 million bp, EIA data showed. Still, the rate of production growth in the Permian basin, the biggest U.S. oilpatch which spans Texas and New Mexico, is slowing amid transportation bottlenecks as pipelines have filled. Drilling companies cut oil rigs for a second consecutive week as new drilling stalled in the third quarter with the fewest additions in a quarter since 2017, data showed on Friday. Total U.S. oil demand was up 3 percent in July compared with last year, driven by strong demand for distillates, EIA data shows. Distillate demand jumped 6.8 percent, or 251,000 bpd, in July year-on-year, while gasoline demand was up 0.7 percent, or 67,000 bpd, in July compared with last year, EIA data showed. Meanwhile, natural gas production in the lower 48 U.S. states rose to an all-time high of 92.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in July, up from the prior record of 90.9 bcfd in June, according to EIA’s 914 production report. Output in Texas, the nation’s largest gas producer, increased to 24.6 bcfd in July, up 1.5 percent from June. That was the most since April 2016. In Pennsylvania, the second biggest gas producing state, production rose to a record high 17.0 bcfd in July, up 3.0 percent from June. That compares with output of 14.7 bcfd in July 2017.

2018-09-28,"(Adds slowing growth rate for rig additions in Permian basin) By Scott DiSavino Sept 28 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies cut oil rigs for a second consecutive week as new drilling stalled in the third quarter with the fewest additions in a quarter since 2017 due to pipeline constraints in the nation’s largest oil field. Drillers cut three oil rigs in the week to Sept. 28, bringing the total count down to 863, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI For the third quarter, the increase of five oil rigs was the smallest since drillers cut three rigs in the fourth quarter of 2017. They added 50 rigs in the first quarter and 61 rigs in the second quarter of 2018. For the month of September, meanwhile, the oil rig count was up one, the same rise as in August. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 750 rigs were active as energy companies have been ramping up production in anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than previous years. The rig count has held mostly steady since June as spot crude prices in the Permian region in western Texas and eastern New Mexico WTM- WTC-WTM have collapsed due to a lack of pipeline infrastructure needed to transport more fuel out of the region. On a quarterly basis, drillers in the Permian are still adding rigs, but the pace of those additions has slowed each quarter this year to just 13 added in the third quarter from 31 in the second quarter and 44 in the first quarter. Production in the Permian is forecast to rise to 3.5 million barrels per day in October, just below output from Iran, OPEC’s third largest producer. More than half the total U.S. oil rigs are in the Permian, the country’s biggest shale oil formation. Active units there declined by two this week to 486. Overall, U.S. oil production rose to a record high 11.0 million bpd in July, according to federal data, rivaling output from top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia. U.S. crude futures were trading near $74 per barrel on Friday, putting the contract on track to rise for a third week in a row as U.S. sanctions on Iran tighten global oil supplies. The contract is on track to rise almost 5 percent this month but down more than 1 percent for the quarter. So far this year, U.S. oil futures have averaged $66.79 per barrel. That compares with averages of $50.85 in calendar 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading over $73 for the balance of 2018 and near $72 for calendar 2019 . In anticipation of higher prices in 2018 and 2019 than last year, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided guidance indicating an 18 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks expect to spend a total of $85.3 billion in 2018. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Since 1,054 oil and gas rigs were already in service, drillers would only have to add a handful of rigs during the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. So far this year, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,019. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas.

2018-09-28,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - A tsunami caused deaths when it hit a small city on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday after a major quake, collapsing buildings and cutting off power, officials said, although the exact number of casualties was not clear. The tsunami up to 2 metres (six feet) high struck beaches as dusk fell in Palu, a sleepy but growing tourist resort, and the nearby fishing town of Donggala, closest to the epicenter of the quake 27 km away, officials said.  “The earthquake and tsunami caused several casualties ... while initial reports show that victims died in the rubble of a collapsing building,” National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told reporters. “The number of casualties and the full impact is still being calculated.”  Sutopo said the disaster caused a power outage that cut communications in Donggala and surrounding areas. The Communications Ministry is working to repair 276 electricity base stations. Officials said aftershocks, the communications breakdown and the power outage made it hard to coordinate rescue efforts. More than 600,000 people live in Palu and Donggala. “The 1.5- to two-meter tsunami has receded,” Dwikorita Karnawati, who heads Indonesia’s meteorology and geophysics agency, BMKG, told Reuters. “The situation is chaotic. People are running on the streets and buildings have collapsed. There is a ship washed ashore.” BMKG had earlier issued a tsunami warning but lifted it within the hour. Amateur footage shown by local TV stations, which could not immediately be authenticated by Reuters, showed waters crashing into houses along Palu’s shoreline, scattering shipping containers and flooding into a mosque in the city. The national search and rescue agency will deploy a large ship and helicopters to aid the operation, said agency chief Muhammad Syaugi, adding he had not been able to contact his team in Palu.  The armed forces and police will also provide troops and equipment to support the emergency response, officials aid. Oil company Pertamina said its fuel depot in Donggala had been damaged in the incident though there was no oil spill. Fuel tanks had shifted in the quake and ship loading facilities were disabled among other damage. There were no reports of damage to producing oil and gas fields in the area, according to the energy ministry. Palu, hit by a 6.2 magnitude quake in 2005 which killed one person, is a tourist resort at the end of a narrow bay famous for its beaches and water sports.  In 2004, an earthquake off the northern Indonesian island of Sumatra triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean, killing 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. Some people took to Twitter saying they could not contact loved ones. “My family in Palu is unreachable,” Twitter user @noyvionella said. Palu airport was closed. The area was hit by a lighter quake earlier in the day, which destroyed some houses, killing one person and injuring at least 10 in Donggala, authorities said. The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude of the second quake at a strong 7.5, after first saying it was 7.7.  “Aftershocks are still continuing,” Nugroho said. “Communication has been crippled at this time, causing difficulties in coordination and reporting with the region.” Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. A series of earthquakes in July and August killed nearly 500 people on the holiday island of Lombok, hundreds of kilometres southwest of Sulawesi.

2018-09-28,"* Rosneft had filed $1.4 billion lawsuit * Dispute about how oil should be shared between adjacent fields (Adds comments on production increase) By Nidhi Verma NEW DELHI, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Russia’s Sakhalin-1 consortium, led by ExxonMobil, has agreed to pay Russian energy giant Rosneft $230 million in an out-of-court settlement of an oil production dispute, an executive of an Indian consortium partner said on Friday. Rosneft had filed a $1.4 billion lawsuit in the Sakhalin district arbitration court in Russia’s far east, accusing the consortium of unjust enrichment, an allegation the consortium denied. The dispute centred around how oil should be shared between the Sakhalin-1 concession and an adjacent Rosneft field. “Rosneft was demanding that it should be paid $1.4 billion ... We have agreed for an out-of-court settlement and will be paying $230 million as Rosneft entered the other area in 2011,” N.K. Verma, managing director of India’s ONGC Videsh, a partner in the Sakhalin-1 consortium, told Reuters. Rosneft, which also has a stake in the Sakhalin-1 consortium, declined to comment. ExxonMobil in Moscow declined immediate comment. “We don’t have anything we can share,” said Suann Guthrie, an ExxonMobil spokeswoman in the United States. P.K. Rao, director for operations at ONGC Videsh, said the out-of-court settlement was reached about 10 days ago. The row was over oil “cross-flows” from Northern Chayvo oilfield, controlled by Rosneft. Sakhalin-1, off Russia’s Pacific Ocean coast, is operated by Exxon Neftegaz Ltd, through which ExxonMobil owns 30 percent in the project. Rosneft and ONGC control 20 percent each. Japanese consortium Sodeco owns 30 percent. ONGC’s Verma said production at Sakhalin-1 reached 250,000 barrels per day (bpd), up from some 200,000 bpd, as Russia had lifted output restrictions as part of a global deal with OPEC. Russia’s total oil production hit a post-Soviet high of 11.347 million barrels per day this month. The dispute between Rosneft and the Sakhalin-1 consortium unfolded against the background of a wider rift between Russia and the United States over what Washington called Moscow’s meddling in a 2016 presidential election. Exxon had to quit some joint projects with Rosneft, including developing Arctic oil and gas, over sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States. Participation in Sakhalin-1 is not punishable by sanctions.

That compares with averages of $50.85 in calendar 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading over $73 for the balance of 2018 and near $72 for calendar 2019 . In anticipation of higher prices in 2018 and 2019 than last year, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided guidance indicating an 18 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks expect to spend a total of $85.3 billion in 2018. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Since 1,054 oil and gas rigs were already in service, drillers would only have to add a handful of rigs during the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. So far this year, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,019. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-09-28,"(New throughout, updates prices, adds details and analyst comment) By Mark Weinraub CHICAGO, Sept 28 (Reuters) - U.S. corn and soybean supplies were bigger than expected despite record usage during the summer, the U.S. government said on Friday. Weak prices for corn and soybeans, stemming from concerns about exports, stoked domestic demand from crushers and processors eager to run their plants as much as possible amid strong profit margins. But the usage rates — 3.164 billion bushels of corn and 781 million bushels during the quarter that ended Sept. 1 — failed to dent the massive stockpiles ahead of what is expected to be a bumper harvest for both crops. “This report is the worst thing that can happen to the American farmer,” said Bob Utterback, president of Utterback Marketing. “We’ve got a lot of inventory in the bin, and they haven’t got it sold.” Soybean stocks as of Sept. 1 were at an 11-year high and corn stocks were the second biggest of the last 30 years. Chicago Board of Trade corn and soybean futures, which had been trading close to unchanged before the data was released, dropped into negative territory and hit session lows. In its quarterly stocks report, the U.S. Agriculture Department said that soybean stocks as of Sept. 1 stood at 438.1 million bushels, the biggest in 11 years. The corn stockpile totaled 2.140 billion bushels, down 7 percent from a year earlier. Wheat stocks were 2.379 billion bushels compared to 2.253 billion bushels a year ago. Analysts had expected the report to show soybean stocks of 401 million bushels, corn stocks of 2.010 billion bushels and wheat stocks of 2.343 billion bushels, according to the average of estimates given in a Reuters poll. USDA also raised its estimate of the soybean crop harvested last fall, to 4.411 billion bushels from 4.392 billion bushels, surprising analysts. “We’re just piling more beans on top of more beans,” said Ted Seifried chief agriculture market strategist for brokerage Zaner Group in Chicago. In a separate report, USDA boosted its estimate of the 2017/18 U.S. wheat crop by 7 million bushels to 1.884 billion bushels, due to increases in spring wheat production. Analysts, on average, had expected the government’s wheat harvest estimate to fall to 1.872 billion bushels. (Additional reporting by P.J.

2018-09-28,"NEW YORK, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The largest U.S. oil trade association urged President Donald Trump on Friday to halt any plans to lift a ban on summer sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline and impose tighter trading restrictions on biofuel credits, saying such a move would be unfair to consumers. The opposition by the American Petroleum Institute (API) means Trump would need to disappoint a key energy constituency in order to move forward with the plan to help Midwestern farmers by expanding sales of corn-based ethanol ahead of November’s congressional elections. Trump has repeatedly said he wants a win-win solution to the nation’s controversial biofuels policy, which has support from both the rival corn and oil industries. “This so-called deal does nothing to fix the program ... it makes things worse,” API Director Frank Macchiarola said on Friday. “It is giving away the store to the ethanol lobby and giving the consumers the tab.” The API, which is concerned that expanding ethanol sales would cut into its market share, believes as many as 75 percent of U.S. cars are incompatible with so-called E15 gasoline and risk losing their warranty if it is put into the gas tank, Macchiarola said. The Renewable Fuel Association disputes the API figure, saying in a tweet that 90 percent of cars in the United States can safely use E15. As part of the E15 deal, the White House is considering imposing restrictions on trading of biofuel credits in an effort to discourage speculation and reduce costs for oil refiners to comply with U.S. biofuels policy, Reuters reported. The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like ethanol into the fuel pool each year, or buy credits from competitors who do. Refining companies that must buy the credits have complained about volatile prices in recent years. The trade restrictions would include capping the number of credits a dealer can hold at 120 percent of their company’s annual compliance obligation and potentially also restricting certain parties from holding the credits for more than 30 days. Macchiarola said such restrictions would hurt liquidity in the RIN market and do more harm than good. Biofuel credit prices were near five-year highs last year, but have dropped sharply to their lowest since 2013, due mainly to the EPA’s expanded use of waivers freeing small refiners from their obligations.

2018-09-28,"* Italian bank stocks take big hit on budget concerns * Japan shares touch 27-year high * Brent crude hits 4-yr high with U.S. sanctions on Iran (Changes byline, dateline to NEW YORK; adds Wall Street open; updates throughout) By Hilary Russ NEW YORK, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar and stocks gained on Friday, but Italy’s government bonds, European stock markets and the euro were slammed by deepening worries about the Italian budget and its new higher-than-expected deficit target. Rome on Thursday targeted a budget deficit of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) for the next three years, marking a victory for party chiefs over economy minister Giovanni Tria, an unaffiliated technocrat. The deficit, though within the prescribed EU limit of 3 percent of GDP, is a concern for investors who fear the anti-establishment government is not committed to tackling its huge debt load. Italy’s debt-to-GDP ratio stands at about 130 percent, the highest in the euro zone behind Greece. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.75 percent. Germany’s DAX was last down 1.52 percent. Shares in Italian banks fell as much as 8.5 percent and closed 7.26 percent lower. Italian government bonds were set for their worst day since a brutal May 29 sell-off, up 34-42 basis points across the curve. The euro fell 0.19 percent to $1.1617. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.12 percent. The picture was rosier on Wall Street, where tech shares also got a big boost from Nvidia Corp, which rose after Evercore raised the chipmaker’s price target to $400. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 43.24 points, or 0.16 percent, to 26,483.17, the S&P 500 gained 3.12 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,917.12 and the Nasdaq Composite added 7.18 points, or 0.09 percent, to 8,049.14. In Asia earlier, Japan’s Nikkei stock index raced to a 27-year high on renewed optimism over the global economy and hopes of a boost to its exporters’ earnings from a weaker yen. The index closed 1.36 percent higher. The dollar index rose 0.17 percent. “The U.S. dollar remains a metaphorical rock in a sea of troubles,” said Karl Schamotta, director of global product and market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto. “The growth outlook for other Group of 10 countries and the emerging markets remains uncertain, and increased confidence in the forces compelling the Federal Reserve to hike rates next year is helping to lift the U.S. dollar against its counterparts,” he added. After the Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday - the third increase this year - Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the United States does not face a large chance of a recession in the next two years and the central bank plans to keep raising rates gradually. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 4/32 in price to yield 3.0426 percent, from 3.055 percent late on Thursday. “We are seeing safety trade due to the Italian crisis, people are coming in and buying U.S. paper and the dollar,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. Energy stocks also got a boost from oil prices, with Brent crude climbing to a fresh four-year high as U.S. sanctions on Tehran squeezed Iranian crude exports. U.S. crude rose 1.58 percent to $73.26 per barrel and Brent was last at $82.89, up 1.86 percent on the day. Additional reporting by Ritvik Carvalho in London, Amy Caren

2018-09-28,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.AS) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N) on Friday led big bets by oil majors seeking to clinch key stakes in Brazil’s coveted offshore oil play, shrugging off concerns over presidential elections that have cast a pall of uncertainty over the industry. Shell and Chevron pledged to the government a high 70.2 percent of the oil it will produce after costs to clinch the choice Saturno block, while Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Qatar Petroleum International landed the Tita area with a 24.5 percent offer, with both groups locking in key real estate in the prized Santos basin. By placing all four blocks, Brazil’s cash-strapped government raked in 6.82 billion reais ($1.71 billion), days ahead of the most uncertain presidential vote in a generation, as oil companies scrambled to take advantage of what could be the last oil auction in years.   Leftist candidates have proposed slowing down oil auctions, revising market-friendly legislation or even clawing back areas already awarded. Meanwhile, right-wing presidential front-runner Jair Bolsonaro has floated the idea of privatizing state oil firm Petrobras (PETR4.SA) and has said he would champion a market-friendly approach.  “We take a long term view on these things,” said Felipe Arbelaez, chief for Latin America of BP Plc (BP.L), which took the Santos Basin’s Pau Brasil block in a consortium with Colombia’s Ecopetrol and China’s CNOOC Ltd (0883.HK). “Ultimately, we think Brazil has a long track record of respect of law, respect of contracts so we’re not very concerned about the elections,” Arbelaez said. Lured by world-class geology, shrinking reserves and rising oil prices, companies have already dropped billions of dollars in Brazil, Latin America’s top oil producer, to lock in stakes in its pre-salt layer, where billions of barrels of oil are trapped under a thick layer of salt offshore. Oil majors’ interest has been boosted by industry-friendly policies under center-right President Michel Temer, including loosening rules favoring local suppliers, tax sweeteners and the removal of a requirement that Petrobras be sole operator in pre-salt blocks. But a win by a leftist candidate could walk back many of the market-friendly policies. Fernando Haddad, a leftist academic who has climbed into the No. 2 spot, has vowed to recover the pre-salt to serve Brazilians instead of foreign oil companies. He also pledged to restore stricter requirements for using local suppliers. Ciro Gomes, a leftist former state governor in third place, has threatened to freeze auctions and expropriate blocks already handed out. Oil prices rose more than 1 percent on Friday, with Brent climbing to a fresh four-year high, as U.S. sanctions on Tehran squeezed Iranian crude exports, tightening supply.  But oil majors discounted the role of the price rise in betting plans in Brazil.  “Our decisions are not made based on the day’s change or price per barrel,”  said Andre Araujo, Shell’s country chief in Brazil. “They are investments for 30 years...we do not make decisions based on volatile issues,” he added.  Under rules set up for Brazil’s pre-salt oil play, consortia vie for blocks by offering the most after-cost oil to the Brazilian government, and agree to pay a fixed signing bonus. Petrobras was the sole bidder and winner the Southwest of Tartaruga Verde block in the Campos Basin. It had exercised its right to express interest in the block months before the Friday bid round.

2018-09-28,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government is on track to find a solution for tackling pollution from diesel vehicles but there is no agreement yet, a government source said after Chancellor Angela Merkel chaired a meeting on Friday in Berlin. Final details of a deal that seeks to avert bans on older vehicles from city streets should be hammered out when leaders of Merkel’s coalition of conservatives and center-left social democrats meet on Monday. “We’re on a good track,” the source told Reuters. “There are only details that need to be cleared up.” Merkel has set an end-September deadline to find a way to tackle pollution from diesel vehicles, and avert more driving bans in cities that are being forced by courts to take action to improve air quality. Yet her government has been split on how best to tackle the problem, with Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer siding with carmakers in calling for incentives to encourage owners of older models to trade them in for newer, cleaner ones. Environment Minister Svenja Schulze has, meanwhile, called for hardware retrofits on older models - an option that the industry says is only feasible in some cases but which would hit fuel consumption and performance in others. “We significantly narrowed our differences at today’s meeting,” said deputy environment minister Florian Pronold, standing by his ministry’s call for retrofits and saying they should be paid for by manufacturers. Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE) could offer owners of older vehicles that meet the Euro 4 emissions standard, as well as owners of some Euro 5 standard models, to trade in their cars for new ones, sources said before the meeting. Scheuer, also speaking before the talks, told broadcaster n-tv that he would propose such incentives, saying the most effective way to reduce air pollution was to renew the fleet of cars plying Germany’s city streets. Any solution is likely to cost several billion euros. Scheuer said this week that car owners and taxpayers should not foot the bill. In separate comments on Friday, he said he supported hardware upgrades for around 30,000 commercial vehicles, telling the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland newspaper group they could be funded from an existing clean-air program. Earlier on Friday, the FAZ newspaper reported that carmakers may offer owners of vehicles affected by driving bans vouchers for hardware upgrades by suppliers such as Baumot (TINCk.DE) or HJS, without citing sources. FAZ said the scheme would apply to some Euro 5 diesel vehicles and would cover 80 percent of the cost of upgrades, up to a maximum level of 3,000 euros ($3,500) per vehicle. Older vehicles meeting the Euro 4 standard would not be covered, but their owners would be offered incentives to swap their vehicles for new ones, it said. Daimler, Volkswagen and BMW declined to comment.

2018-09-28,"OSLO (Reuters) - Two banks will raise the fees they charge power traders for clearing transactions on Nasdaq’s (NDAQ.O) Nordic power exchange after a trader’s default this month, sources at the banks said, while other banks may follow. Derivatives trader Einar Aas racked up losses he could not cover on Sept. 10, leaving a 114 million euro ($132 million) hole in Nasdaq’s clearing house buffers. This forced members of the power market’s clearing operation to help fill the gap, including banks which process trades for customers. “The default brought a new situation. It is natural the costs for the clients will have to be adjusted,” said one of the sources, who is the head of clearing operations at a European bank. “Our cost has to be covered and fees will rise depending on each customer’s individual risk.” This source said the bank would raise fees for customers within days or weeks. A senior executive at the second bank said the bank would also soon raise fees to a “small extent” for its customers following the default.     Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity. Swedish bank SEB (SEBa.ST) and Dutch bank ABN AMRO (ABNd.AS) said they were considering raising their fees.     “We will have a discussion with the members clearing through us and Nasdaq. One possible outcome after assessing the risk could be raising the cost of clearing fees,” said SEB spokesman Frank Hojem. SEB will take into account risks of credit losses as well as regular running costs in pricing its clearing services, Hojem said. “We are considering our options. There are several options on the table. We will communicate our decision when we are ready,” ABN AMRO spokesman Arien Bikker said. Sparebank 1 SMN (MING.OL) and Danske Bank (DANSKE.CO) said they did not plan to raise fees.  Citigroup (C.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) declined to comment.     Some power traders, who usually pay clearing fees themselves, said they would now consider using banks to help protect against risk. Emma Mazhari, head of forward optimization at Germany energy firm Ε.ΟΝ (EONGn.DE) said: “We (already) clear through a bank, we were not directly impacted on that (the default) but you can anticipate that there will be indirect consequences for us further down the line.”  She said an increase in banks’ clearing fees was not surprising. “Obviously we would have to look at that.” Increased bank fees could trigger chain reactions and change the market, said Tor Mosegaard, head of power markets for Danske Commodities, which has already started to reduce its position on the Nordic power exchange. “If our bank raised fees substantially we will consider closing our links to that bank ... I will negotiate with other banks,” Mosegaar, who did not identify the bank, said. ($1 = 0.8639 euros) Reporting by Lefteris Karagiannopoulos.

2018-09-28,"* November price down on reduced demand * Asian utilities not yet ready for winter buying * More cargoes head to northwest Europe LONDON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Asian spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices have further receded this week from multi-year seasonal highs due to lacklustre demand from well-stocked Asian utilities and healthy supply. Spot prices for November LNG-AS delivery in Asia have fallen to as low as $11.10 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), down 40 cents from the week before, industry sources said. Cargoes for the second half of October are likely valued at $10.70 to $11.00 per mmBtu. Traders said demand had declined in the period between summer and winter and that Asian utilities were not yet ready to buy for the winter. More cargoes are heading to Europe, another indicator of low demand from Asia, and supply is healthy. Rising crude oil prices and spot demand from Japan, South Korea and China ahead of the peak winter heating season had pushed LNG prices to seasonal highs at the start of this month. However, Asian utilities seem well-stocked going into October and November. Japan is expected to experience warmer-than-average temperatures from October to December, forecasts show. Nuclear availability in Japan could also improve as utility Shikoku Electric Power Co moves closer to restarting its only operable nuclear reactor, after a court rejected a lawsuit that would have prevented operation of the nuclear unit. However, parts of South Korea and China are expected to have temperatures below the seasonal norm, which could help lift demand in coming weeks. Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands expect at least seven LNG tankers over the next two weeks or so, more than in previous weeks and a sign that Asian buyers are well-stocked. The UK gas price for November is at 76.10 pence per therm but could go up again due to a colder-than-expected week ahead. Further gains could result in the Asian spot price having to rise to keep a premium to northwest Europe to attract volumes from the Atlantic basin, Thomson Reuters analysts said. Supply is quite robust even though some maintenance is going on at LNG plants. U.S. Dominion Energy Inc started a scheduled three-week maintenance outage on Sept. 21 at the Cove Point LNG export terminal in Maryland. Planned maintenance is ongoing at Oman LNG. U.S. tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods and retaliatory taxes by Beijing on $60 billion of U.S. products, including LNG, kicked off on Monday. U.S. exporters including LNG suppliers would “certainly” be hurt, but Beijing’s retaliation would provide opportunities to other LNG-exporting countries, China’s Vice Commerce Minister Wang Yi said, adding that Australia is an important source of the fuel for China. Analysts said they see no short-term effect on LNG pricing. Elsewhere, India said it would start operating a new LNG import facility in western Gujarat state by the end of October but it would take around a year to reach full capacity. This week, Qatar announced plans to boost its LNG production capacity, by adding a fourth production line to raise its output capacity from the North Field to 110 million tonnes a year, by the end of 2023 or early 2024. This is an increase of around 43 percent from its current production capacity of 77 million tonnes a year.

2018-09-28,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) supervisory board on Friday deferred a decision on the future of Rupert Stadler, the suspended chief executive of its premium brand Audi (NSUG.DE), a person familiar with the matter said. German daily Handelsblatt reported earlier on Friday that the board had held off because of an imminent decision by the German government on how to tackle pollution from diesel vehicles. Given that Germany’s auto industry has rejected a proposal to lower the emissions of older diesel vehicles with hardware retrofits as too costly, it would be poor timing to spend millions of euros to buy Stadler out of his contract, which was extended by five years last year, the report said. Stadler was forced to step down temporarily after he was taken into custody in mid-June on suspicion of interfering with an emissions investigation. Sales executive Bram Schot is acting as interim replacement. Both VW and Audi have said that Stadler is presumed innocent unless proven otherwise. In July, Volkswagen recruited BMW (BMWG.DE) engine development and purchasing expert Markus Duesmann, who has been touted as a potential successor to Stadler as VW looks for clean-engine expertise to help it shake off the emissions scandal.

2018-09-28,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada’s economy grew by a stronger-than-expected 0.2 percent in July, boosting market expectations that the Bank of Canada would raise interest rates next month for the fifth time in little over a year. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast 0.1 percent growth from June. Statistics Canada said on Friday that 12 of the 20 sectors gained. The figures are significant because the Bank of Canada earlier this month forecast that temporary factors would weigh on third-quarter gross domestic product. Governor Stephen Poloz on Thursday pledged to raise rates gradually and closely watch economic data. The next fixed interest rate decision is on Oct 24. The bank has hiked rates four times since July 2017 as the economy strengthened and unemployment neared record lows. Graphic - Canada monthly GDP, exports to the U.S.: link.reuters.com/jev87s Graphic - Canada economic snapshot: tmsnrt.rs/2e8hNWV Graphic - Canada producer prices : link.reuters.com/cuj92t Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics, said the economy was on track for third-quarter annualized growth of about 2 percent. “That would be stronger than the 1.5 percent expected by the Bank of Canada and is therefore another reason to expect the Bank to raise interest rates next month,” he said in a note. Market expectations of an interest rate hike in October were reflected in overnight index swaps, which rose slightly to 78.27 percent from 76.46 percent.  The Canadian dollar  added to earlier gains after the report, touching C$1.2978 to the U.S. dollar, or 77.05 U.S. cents. “A Bank of Canada hike in October already looked like a near-lock, but today’s report will fuel more speculation around a follow-up in January,” said Andrew Kelvin and Mark McCormick  at TD Securities. Statscan said the manufacturing sector increased by 1.2 percent as key segments recovered after shutdowns for maintenance and retooling. Output of petroleum and coal products climbed by 7.6 percent. Wholesale trade grew by 1.4 percent after a 1.2 percent decline in June. The utilities sector expanded by 2.1 percent as a heat wave boosted demand for electric power generation and distribution. Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, took a more cautious tone, saying an October rate hike would depend on the fate of slow-moving talks to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement. Poloz though indicated on Thursday that even if trade ties with the United States deteriorated, higher rates might be needed to counter the effect of tariffs. Separately, Statscan said producer prices fell 0.5 percent in August, pulled down for the second consecutive month by lower prices for primary non-ferrous metal products.

2018-09-28,"COPENHAGEN, Sept 28 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Kayaking along canals to pick up your groceries, walking a few minutes to the metro station, or cycling down pedestrianised streets to meet the neighbours: if you want to live in Copenhagen’s North Harbour, a car would be obsolete. That, at least, is the aim of architect Rita Justesen. Since 2007 she has been tasked with transforming the former industrial harbour in Denmark’s capital into a brand-new neighbourhood, and ensuring its 3.5 million square metres of residential and commercial floor space is financially viable and climate-smart. That means cars tucked away, inconveniently, in centralised carparks to discourage driving; more cycle paths; canals and harbour pools clean enough to swim in; and the construction of a well-connected metro station for its projected 40,000 residents and 40,000 workers by 2060. As nations race to reach ambitious climate goals to lower carbon emissions, many cities have been looking to sustainable urban designs to help residents cut energy use, boost social well-being and cohesion, and cope with rising heat and flooding. Designing spaces that acknowledge the impact of climate change can help to change behaviour and make it easier for people to live greener lives, according to a report by the British Psychological Society. “We said we would make a sustainable city ‘the Copenhagen way’. That means that to live sustainably, it has to be easy. So that means short distances to the metro, shops and recreational functions,” Justesen, lead architect at city council-owned firm By & Havn, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “We also really want to make an attractive district where people want to live and stay - that for us is also sustainable in the long term,” said Justesen, as she walked past construction sites in North Harbour, which has housed 1,500 residents since 2015. Around the world, cities use more than two-thirds of the world’s energy and account for about three-quarters of carbon dioxide emissions, according to the United Nations. With rapid urbanisation, more than two-thirds of people will live in cities by 2050, the U.N. projects. That is why cities are seen as key to meeting the commitment under the 2015 Paris Agreement of reducing emissions to keep the rise in global temperatures to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6F) above pre-industrial levels. A 1.5-degree Celsius rise would give vulnerable populations a chance of surviving climate shocks like flooding, cyclones, droughts and higher sea levels, experts say. Worldwide, sea levels have risen 26 centimetres (10 inches) since the late 19th century, driven up by melting ice and a natural expansion of water in the oceans as they warm, United Nations data show. A U.N. panel of climate scientists said in 2014 that sea levels could rise by up to a metre by 2100. Surrounded by open waters and prone to heavy rainfall, Copenhagen faces the same risks as low-lying, poorer cities. The sea level around the harbour city is expected to rise by up to one metre over the next century, according to the Danish Meteorological Institute. Copenhagen council estimated that if there were no form of protection from flooding due to storm surges, the damage over the next century would cost up to 20 billion Danish krone ($3.14 billion). By comparison, it would cost up to four billion Danish krone ($627 million) to prevent this from happening. Apart from future-proofing itself from the sea-level rise and flooding - from green roofs and parks that absorb rainwater, to large barriers that can curb flooding - the city is also on a mission to become the first capital to cut climate-changing emissions by 2025. “If we look at global development, we see an increase in populations in cities, and it’s a really huge number. And if investments are not climate-friendly, then (climate change) will be impossible to solve,” Jorgen Abildgaard, director of the city’s climate programme, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Like Justesen, architect Peter Raaschou-Nielsen said creating spaces that help people cope with climate shocks has been at the core of all his designs at Danish firm Gehl. But fostering social cohesion and interactions are also crucial for sustainable cities of the future, he said. “The projects I’ve been working on have had this focus on the environment - socially, financially, well-being, nature - to create better cities for the people living there and also to do something positive for the environment,” he said at his studio. Raaschou-Nielsen cited the positive effects of a 2012 redevelopment project he worked on in the flood-prone town of Kokkedal, 30 kilometres (18 miles) north of Copenhagen. Though the rundown area had a reputation for crime and gangs, it was revitalised through features like better lighting for improved safety, green spaces and community gardens. “It’s no longer the ‘ghetto’ but it’s transformed into lively neighbourhoods with a new identity,” said Raaschou-Nielsen. “It’s great that you can do a solution like that ... and at the same time you solve these climate challenges,” he said.

2018-09-28,"* Belgium facing tight power supply due to nuclear outages * Grid operator says needs up to 1,700 MW additional capacity * Says cannot rule out power rationing (Adds grid operator statement, background) By Alissa de Carbonnel BRUSSELS, Sept 28 (Reuters) - French gas and power group Engie said on Friday that maintenance work at its Belgian nuclear reactor Tihange 1 would end earlier than planned, which could ease concerns over tight electricity supply. Belgium is facing an unprecedented power supply deficit ahead of winter, with only one of seven nuclear reactors operated by Engie’s Belgian unit Electrabel scheduled to have been operational in November. The change in repair work will bring the number up to two. Electricity grid operator Elia warned on Wednesday that Belgium was facing a tough supply situation due to the long-term outage of the reactors which accounts for 25 percent of its installed capacity. “With just a few weeks to go before winter starts, Belgium is facing the unexpected unavailability of multiple nuclear power stations, a situation that is severely testing the balance between generation and consumption,” Elia said in a statement. Without an additional 1,600 megawatts (MW) to 1,700 MW of capacity, Elia said it cannot always guarantee security of supply without a power rationing or so-called load shedding plan. Elia said it was talking to the Belgian government and power operators, but security of supply was not guaranteed for November, the most critical month, and it did not see solutions that could fully resolve the supply issue. “Which is why, even if the Belgian and international markets provide us with all available capacity, we cannot yet rule out the need to activate the load-shedding plan,” Elia said. Fears over tight supply during the winter months when demand for heating rises has push Belgian power contracts new highs. Engie said Tihange 1 will now be shut for maintenance from Oct. 13 until Nov. 17, instead of Oct. 20 until Nov. 29. Electrabel operates two more reactors at Tihange and four at Doel, producing about half the country’s electricity. Following the discovery of problems with the concrete in some of the plants, outages were prolonged at its Tihange 2 and 3 reactors. Engie has faced criticism over its management of Belgium’s ageing nuclear plants, with Belgian public broadcaster RTBF running comments from an industry source accusing it of allowing degradation at its facilities. Engie dismissed the report on Friday, saying “nuclear safety is an absolute priority” and that Electrabel invests 200 million euros ($232 million) a year in maintenance work. The utility last week said the extended outages at Belgian plants would push its 2018 net recurring income to the low end of its 2.45 billion-2.65 billion euros forecast range. $1 = 0.8636 euros

2018-09-28,"LONDON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Emerging market bonds returned to favour in the past week, taking in some $1.5 billion, though there were heavy redemptions from broader bond and equity funds which shed a collective $8 billion, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) said on Friday. Data from BAML, which tracks fund flows from Wednesday to Wednesday, found that emerging market debt, a sector that has been battered in recent months, had taken in the most money in six months over the Sept 19-26 period. The turnaround comes after a long period of weakness in emerging markets, caused by currency crises in Turkey and Argentina, the trade conflict between the United States and China and the rising dollar. But the selloff appeared to have stalled in recent weeks, possibly as investors see value in the sector. “Investors quickly back to ‘rent’ emerging markets,” BAML told clients, describing the recent selloff as “No EMergency.” However government and investment grade bonds witnessed the biggest weekly outflow since the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president in November 2016. The past week featured a 25 basis point rate rise by the U.S. Federal Reserve, its third hike this year. Some $2.9 billion left government debt funds in the week up to September 26, following inflows of $1.7 billion in the proceeding week, BAML said. Investment grade bonds were also hard hit, with withdrawals of $3.3 billion, making it the worst performing asset class in 2018. BAML data also showed the biggest four-week outflows since December 2016, of which 52 percent came in the last week. In equities, investors had pulled $3.3 billion out of global stocks, BAML said citing outflows across U.S, Japanese, European and emerging market stocks. European equity funds have shed money in 28 out of the past 29 weeks.

2018-09-28,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Italy’s government bonds, European stock markets and the euro were hit hard on Friday after Rome agreed to set a higher than expected budget deficit target that could put it on a collision course with Brussels. The Italian government on Thursday targeted a budget deficit of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) for the next three years, marking a victory for party chiefs over economy minister Giovanni Tria, an unaffiliated technocrat. The deficit, though within the prescribed EU limit of 3 percent of GDP, is a concern for investors who fear the anti-establishment government is not committed to tackling its huge debt load. Italy’s debt-to-GDP ratio stands at about 130 percent, the highest in the euro zone behind Greece. European shares fell 0.8 percent, with shares in Italian banks - whose big sovereign bond portfolios make them sensitive to political risk - bearing the brunt of selling pressure. Shares in Italian banks were down 7.5 percent. Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 4 percent, while Germany’s DAX fell by 1.5 percent. Italian government bonds were set for their worst day since a brutal May 29 sell off, up 34-42 basis points across the curve. The euro fell to an 11-day low of $1.1615 after suffering its worst one-day decline in seven weeks on Thursday. “The 2.4 percent target is not consistent with an improvement in the structural budget balance and hence they seem to be on a collision course with Brussels,” said ING strategist Martin van Vliet. “For me the key issue is what they assume on the budget beyond 2019. They are seemingly leaving the path of fiscal consolidation and that may not sit well with ratings agencies.” The falls in European shares left MSCI’s All-Country World Index down 0.3 percent on the day and set for its firstly weekly loss since early September. In Asia earlier, Japan’s Nikkei raced to a 27-year high on the back of a lower yen and improved prospects for corporate earnings. Japan’s Nikkei stock index rose as high as 24,286.10 points, its strongest since November 1991, on renewed optimism over the global economy and hopes of a boost to exporters’ earnings from a weaker yen. It was last up 1.5 percent. Shares in China were higher ahead of a week-long national holiday. Blue-chips stocks gained 0.8 percent and the country’s main Shanghai Composite index was up 0.7 percent. Elsewhere in Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was little changed, with a 0.05 percent decline. Australian shares rose 0.4 percent, while Seoul’s Kospi gave up 0.5 percent after hitting three-month highs on Thursday. S&P E-mini futures crept lower on Friday, down 0.1 percent after gains on Wall Street overnight. The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, was up 0.4 percent at 95.292 on Friday, hitting its highest levels since Sept. 10 After the Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday - the third increase this year - Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the United States does not face a large chance of a recession in the next two years and the central bank plans to keep raising rates gradually. But Citi analysts cautioned that not all data was reassuring. “The Citi US Economic Surprise Index has been pushed into negative territory by disappointing housing data in the United States,” they wrote. “The latest data confirms that the housing market continues to be less than ideal. Pending home sales, a leading indicator, declined to the lowest level in seven months.” U.S. Treasury yields hit their lowest in ten days. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 3.0280 percent on Friday, against Thursday’s U.S. close of 3.055 percent. U.S. crude oil was flat at $72.15 a barrel and Brent crude was up half a percent at $82.04. Gold advanced slightly after tumbling 1 percent on Thursday on strength in the U.S. dollar, which made bullion more expensive for buyers using other currencies.

Growth in August alone was 2 percent year-on-year, down from 4.6 percent in July and from 4.3 percent a year earlier. The highest growth in August was registered in the financial sector, trade, transport and real estate operations. The former Soviet republic hosts pipelines carrying Caspian oil and gas to Europe. Georgia is recovering from a decline in exports and a plunge in the currencies of its main trading partners, which have depressed economic growth in recent years. In 2017 Georgia recorded growth of 5 percent as exports recovered and remittances from abroad rose. The fastest growing sectors were the processing industry, services and real estate. The government expects growth of 4.5 percent in 2018 overall. Fitch Ratings may upgrade Georgia’s sovereign credit rating if the country maintains strong economic growth and macroeconomic stability and further improves its finances, the agency’s analyst told Reuters earlier this month.

2018-09-28,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China’s Sinopec Corp is halving loadings of crude oil from Iran this month, as the state refiner comes under intense pressure from Washington to comply with a U.S. ban on Iranian oil from November, said people with knowledge of the matter.  The sources did not specify volumes, but based on the prevailing supply contract between the top Chinese refiner and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), its loadings would be reduced to about 130,000 barrels per day (bpd).  This would be 20 percent of China’s average daily imports from Iran in 2017, dealing a blow to Tehran, which has counted its top oil client to maintain imports while European and other Asian buyers wind down purchases to avoid U.S. sanctions.  The cut marks Sinopec’s deepest reduction in years as the Hong Kong and New York-listed state oil company faces direct pressure from a U.S administration determined to choke off the flow of petrodollars to the Islamic Republic.  GRAPHIC: Asia's Iranian crude oil imports - tmsnrt.rs/2cNidjY The move comes after senior U.S. officials visited the refiner in Beijing last month, demanding steep cutbacks in Iranian oil purchases, said one of the sources.  “This round is completely different from last time. Then it was more of a consultative tone, but this time it’s almost like an ultimatum,” said the source.      The sources declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the matter. Sinopec declined to comment. NIOC did not respond a Reuters email seeking comment.  Further complicating the matter, Iran is having difficulty securing insurance for its oil vessels, said shipping and insurance sources, as most European and U.S.-based re-insurance firms are winding down their Iranian business.  Chinese buyers, including Sinopec and state-run trader Zhuhai Zhenrong Corp, have since July shifted their cargoes to vessels owned by National Iranian Tanker Co (NITC) to keep supplies flowing amid the reinstatement of economic sanctions by the United States.  During the last round of United Nations sanctions around 2011, officials from Washington asked Chinese firms to curb investments in Iranian oil and gas fields, but stopped short of demanding a full stop to oil shipments. (reut.rs/2xHEYy2)  It’s not clear if Zhuhai Zhenrong has also reduced loadings this month. The state trader is contracted to lift some 240,000 bpd from Iran, mainly to feed Sinopec refineries.  It’s also not clear if Sinopec and PetroChina are cutting loadings from their upstream investment in key Iranian oilfields that total between 100,000 to 150,000 bpd. These loadings are separate from their annual supply contracts.  Beijing has repeatedly defended its energy trade with Tehran, worth about $1.5 billion a month, as transparent and lawful. Some of the top oil refineries that come under Sinopec are configured to process Iranian oil.

Measured in tonnes, average daily oil production stood at 1.548 million tonnes in that period, the source said, citing preliminary data that the Russian Energy Ministry obtains from oil companies. The ministry, which is due to publish monthly production data for September on Oct. 2, did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment.

2018-09-28,"SINGAPORE/TOKYO/LONDON (Reuters) - High-sulfur fuel oil (HSFO), essentially the leftovers of an oil refiner’s output, will still flow from refineries around the world even after new rules start up in 2020 curtailing its use in the global shipping fleet, a Reuters survey showed. Sixty percent of the 33 refineries contacted by Reuters in a global survey will still produce HSFO in 2020 although the supply will tighten as 70 percent of these refiners plan to reduce their output. Starting that year, ships will have to use marine fuel, which primarily consists of residual fuel oil, with a maximum sulfur content of 0.5 percent under International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules to reduce air pollution.  Currently, the global shipping fleet, which includes oil and chemical tankers as well as container ships, uses as much as 3.3 million barrels per day of HSFO with a maximum of 3.5 percent sulfur. Refiners will have little incentive to produce HSFO after the regulations though some demand will remain as a small but growing number of vessels are fitted with smokestack scrubbers that remove the sulfur from the exhaust fumes and power plants will continue to consume the fuel. “Although HSFO demand for ships is expected to decline substantially in 2020, the oil’s demand for power generation and general users will remain,” Japan’s second-largest refiner Idemitsu Kosan (5019.T) told Reuters in the survey.  “In future, demand for scrubber-equipped ships is projected to recover, so we expect HSFO output to continue.” (Reuters survey of refiners on IMO 2020: tmsnrt.rs/2OG8iv3) When asked how they plan to reduce HSFO output, just over half of the refiners said they will upgrade their plants to further process their fuel oil to produce more higher value products such as gasoline and diesel. Two-thirds of the 16 refiners who responded to a question about how much investment they plan to pump into their plants to produce more ultra-low and low-sulfur fuel oil, said they plan to spend less than $100 million. Five of them are investing between $500 million and more than $1 billion in such projects. Polish refiner Grupa LOTOS (LTSP.WA) will spend more than $600 million to convert its heavy residue to middle distillates and coke by the end of 2019 while Kuwait has a $6.25 billion clean fuels project. Fuel oil, or residue fuel, is the remaining product from crude oil processed through crude distillation units at a refinery. To extract more value from residue, it is further processed at secondary refining units such as residue fluid catalytic crackers, hydrocrackers and cokers to produce  gasoline and diesel. However, secondary units are costly and require years to build while expansion projects in some countries have to overcome tough environment regulations. “We will need (the Environment Protection Agency’s) approval if we want to expand the coker and that is tough in Taiwan now,” Formosa Petrochemical Corp (6505.TW) spokesman KY Lin said.  Formosa has adjusted its coker unit, which uses heat and pressure to break down the residue fuel into other products, to run at 95 percent utilization from 90 percent to reduce its HSFO output, Lin said.  Refiners will want to cut their HSFO output as much as possible to offset the expected drop in value.  By January 2020, 380-centistoke HSFO in Singapore will be worth $16.70 a barrel less than Middle East benchmark Dubai crude, down from a discount of $5 for October 2018, according to swap values. <0#FO380DUBCKM:>  Besides upgrading, a handful of refiners said they would also process more lower sulfur crude oil to reduce the sulfur content in their products output.  Refiners may also cut their overall CDU runs to reduce their residue output if low fuel oil margins drag down overall profits, according to the survey.  “Forward prices are scary,” Formosa’s Lin said. Other refiners will look at alternative markets for their HSFO.  “If fuel oil demand falls, we will switch our configuration to produce bitumen which is in high demand in India due to its road-building program,” said an official from Indian Oil Corp (IOC.NS).  Some refiners prefer to stay flexible by being able to switch their output between low- and high-sulfur fuel oil according to market demand. India’s Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL.NS) said it will be able to produce either fuel oil or switch to other products depending on demand after 2022. “We will not reduce fuel oil output to zero completely as we need our refineries to be flexible,” a BPCL official said. The official declined to be named as they are not authorized to speak to the media. Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI) said it “will produce the minimum amount of HSFO just to satisfy the market demand of the ships that will have installed the scrubbers.” An official from India’s Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL.NS) said the company will be producing some fuel oil but the output will be “very, very low beyond 2022”. A third of the respondents said they are either already not producing any HSFO or will stop producing in 2020. Polish refiner PKN Orlen (PKN.WA) said it will produce fuel oil with 1 percent sulfur content from 2020 while a spokeswoman from Italy’s SARAS (SRS.MI) refinery said, “We are already ready to face IMO-2020 and we already produce basically no HSFO.” Canada’s Husky Energy (HSE.TO) Spokesman Mel Duvall said the company expects to benefit from the new IMO rule since it will boost diesel demand. “It is expected that there will be an increase in global demand for diesel fuel as ship operators switch from high-sulfur fuel oil,” he said.

2018-09-28,"* Highest forecast for 2018, 2019 Brent prices this year * Shale growth could be limited by infrastructure problems * For a table of crude price forecasts, click By Sumita Layek Sept 28 - Oil prices are likely to climb continuously into next year, as concerns over drops in supply from the likes of Iran and Venezuela outweigh any worry that global trade disputes could undermine demand, a Reuters poll showed on Friday. A survey of 50 economists and analysts forecast Brent crude to average $73.48 a barrel in 2018, up from the $72.71 forecast in August and the $72.68 average so far this year. Brent was forecast to average $73.75 in 2019. This is the highest projection for the benchmark for both 2018 and 2019 in the polls this year. “Concerns over global trade disputes have not yet really affected economic growth, but the sanctions on Iran already have had an impact on Iranian exports and output,” said Frank Schallenberger, head of commodity research at LBBW. “If an export destination like South Korea is not willing to buy Iranian oil anymore, there is a high probability that output from Iran could drop some 500,000-1 million bpd. This is really bad news for the supply side - and especially also for the consumers - as prices could go up even further.” Iranian exports of crude and condensates have declined by 0.8 million barrels a day (mbd) from April to September, according to the Institute of International Finance, ahead of the Nov. 4 U.S. sanctions on the third largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Brent prices have risen more than 20 percent since the beginning of April. Analysts expect a reduction of anywhere between 500,000 and 1.5 million bpd in Iranian supply due to the sanctions, with most expecting Saudi Arabia to take the lead in filling any supply gaps. “The best is yet to come with a fourth-quarter of $80+/bbl driven by still strong oil demand growth, expectation of a significant drop in Iranian exports to 1 mbd by year-end and an only limited willingness by OPEC to ramp-up output to exhaust spare capacity,” said Jan Edelmann, commodities analyst at HSH Nordbank AG. However, an escalating trade dispute between the United States and China, the world’s largest consumer of commodities, could affect demand growth, especially next year, analysts said. “Uncertainty about possible effects of a trade war between the U.S. and China could dampen some of the upside risks triggered by the supply issues,” said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro. Meanwhile, U.S. crude futures were forecast to average $67.29 a barrel in 2018, compared with the $67.13 consensus last month and an average of $66.76 until now. A majority of participants saw growth in U.S. shale oil output slowing over the remainder of 2018 and into next year due to infrastructure problems.

2018-09-28,"(Reuters) - Outsourcing company Serco (SRP.L) expects profits this year to jump a better-than-expected 30-40 percent thanks to improved trading and tighter cost control, it said on Friday, sending its battered shares up as much as 15 percent.     Serco provides public services ranging from running prisons and providing border security to operating ferries and trains, and managing healthcare services from payslips to cleaning.  In recent years it has turned its focus abroad and cut costs to compensate for slower public outsourcing in Britain, which accounts for around 40 percent of its revenues.  Chief Executive Rupert Soames described Britain as being “in thrall to Brexit,” in a telephone interview with Reuters. The surprise announcement marked a welcome boost for Serco, which has been hit by the knock-on effect of the collapse of rival Carillion at the start of the year and major difficulties at peers Capita (CPI.L) and Mitie (MTO.L). Asked whether any of the factors affecting its performance were explained by an improving business climate, Soames said: “I would say this (improvement) is pretty much all home-grown. This is about us executing on our plan and it going a little faster than we thought it would.” Serco’s shares were up 13.5 percent to 101.4 pence at 0820 GMT. Prior to Friday, the stock had fallen 10 percent this year, underperformed its FTSE Mid-250 .FTMX index, which has fallen 2 percent. Analysts at broker UBS said the upgrade could imply an up to 5 percent increase for next year’s forecasts too. “We believe the recovery is underway,” they said. Soames said the business backdrop for outsourcing in the United States and Australia was “pretty upbeat”, the Middle East was difficult to read because of geo-political uncertainty while the UK was “in thrall to Brexit.” Soames is a grandson of British wartime prime minister Winston Churchill and closely-connected to political circles. Asked about his expectation of whether Britain will reach a deal to leave the European Union and what kind of deal that might be, he replied: “God knows.”  Serco now expects underlying trading profit of 90-95 million pounds, well above the 69.8 million pounds it reported last year.      It also sees revenue beating market expectations at about 2.8 billion pounds. Previously it had forecast revenue of 2.7-2.8 billion pounds and profit of about 80 million pounds. Full-year results would be boosted by a number of non-recurring trading items, such as end-of-contract settlements. Net debt is expected to be at the lower end of its previous guidance of 200-250 million pounds, helped by early repayment of a vendor loan note issued on its disposal of Intelenet in 2015.  Previously, net debt was forecast in the top half of the range.

2018-09-28,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Friday to its lowest in nearly two weeks while Italy’s bond yields hit their highest in three after the government agreed to set a higher than expected budget deficit target that could put Rome on a collision course with Brussels. The Italian government on Thursday targeted a budget deficit of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) for the next three years, marking a victory for party chiefs over economy minister Giovanni Tria, an unaffiliated technocrat. The deficit, though within the prescribed EU limit of 3 percent of GDP, is a concern for investors who fear the country’s anti-establishment government is not committed to tackling its huge debt load. Italy’s debt-to-GDP ratio stands at about 130 percent, the highest in the euro zone behind Greece. European shares opened lower, with shares in Italian banks - whose big sovereign bond portfolios make them sensitive to political risk - bearing the brunt of selling pressure. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.3 percent by 0743 GMT. Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 1.9 percent, while Germany’s DAX dipped by 0.4 percent. Italy’s two-year bond yields - the most sensitive to political noise in recent months — were up 31 basis points in early trade at 1.09 percent. Other Italian yields were also higher on the day, with five-year yields rising 26 bps to 2.16 percent and benchmark 10-year yields up 17 bps at 3.08 percent. The euro fell to an 11-day low of $1.1615 after suffering its worst one-day decline in seven weeks on Thursday. “The 2.4 percent target is not consistent with an improvement in the structural budget balance and hence they seem to be on a collision course with Brussels,” said ING strategist Martin van Vliet. “For me the key issue is what they assume on the budget beyond 2019. They are seemingly leaving the path of fiscal consolidation and that may not sit well with ratings agencies.” The falls in European shares left MSCI’s All-Country World Index down 0.1 percent and set for its firstly weekly loss since early September. In Asia earlier, Japan’s Nikkei raced to a 27-year high on the back of a lower yen and improved prospects for corporate earnings. Japan’s Nikkei stock index rose as high as 24,286.10 points, its strongest since November 1991, on renewed optimism over the global economy and hopes of a boost to exporters’ earnings from a weaker yen. It was last up 1.5 percent. Shares in China were higher ahead of a week-long national holiday. Blue-chips stocks gained 0.8 percent and the country’s main Shanghai Composite index was up 0.7 percent. Elsewhere in Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was little changed, with a 0.05 percent decline. Australian shares rose 0.4 percent, while Seoul’s Kospi gave up 0.5 percent after hitting three-month highs on Thursday. S&P E-mini futures crept lower on Friday, down 0.1 percent after gains on Wall Street overnight. The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, was up 0.2 percent at 95.086 on Friday. It hit its highest in more than two weeks on Thursday. After the Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday - the third increase this year - Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the United States does not face a large chance of a recession in the next two years and the central bank plans to keep raising rates gradually. But Citi analysts cautioned that not all data was reassuring. “The Citi US Economic Surprise Index has been pushed into negative territory by disappointing housing data in the United States,” they wrote. “The latest data confirms that the housing market continues to be less than ideal. Pending home sales, a leading indicator, declined to the lowest level in seven months.” U.S. Treasury yields ticked lower. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 3.0500 percent on Friday, against Thursday’s U.S. close of 3.055 percent. The two-year yield, closely tied to expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 2.8310 percent, compared with a U.S. close of 2.835 percent. U.S. crude oil gained 0.3 percent to $72.35 a barrel and Brent crude was up 0.3 percent at $81.95. Gold advanced slightly after tumbling 1 percent on Thursday on strength in the U.S. dollar, which made bullion more expensive for buyers using other currencies. Spot gold was up 0.14 percent at $1,184.05 an ounce. Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho

2018-09-28,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Regional utility Shikoku Electric Power Co moved closer to restarting its only operable nuclear reactor, when a court in Japan on Friday rejected a lawsuit that would have prevented operation of the nuclear unit.  The Oita District Court in western Japan rejected the lawsuit filed by residents of the prefecture, Shikoku Electric said in a statement.  The decision removes another potential legal obstacle to a restart of the reactor at Shikoku Electric’s Ikata station in western Japan, after a high court earlier this week overturned an injunction against operation of the plant in a separate case.  Residents near nuclear plants in Japan have stepped up legal challenges in recent years, after the 2011 Fukushima meltdown disaster led to widespread opposition to atomic power and the eventual shutdown of all the country’s reactors.      Several other lawsuits have been filed seeking a shutdown of the Ikata plant. Some of these may be decided before Oct. 27, when Shikoku Electric plans to restart Ikata’s No. 3 reactor, but the utility does not have to wait for the court decisions.  Many of Japan’s reactors are still going through a relicensing process after Fukushima, the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986, highlighted regulatory and operational failings at utilities.  Nine reactors, including Ikata No. 3, have received regulatory approval to restart, with seven of them in operation. On Tuesday this week, the Hiroshima High Court lifted an injunction handed down in December 2017 that ordered Shikoku Electric not to restart the 890-megawatt reactor.      The reactor has been shut since October 2017 for scheduled maintenance and is now free to restart following the Hiroshima judgment. Other units at Ikata are slated for decommissioning.

The bullish outlook for the U.S. economy continued to lift the dollar, which was up 0.1 percent against the yen at 113.49 , and earlier touched a new 2018 high of 113.63. “There’s a couple of reasons that the dollar’s going to remain popular,” said Twidale. “One’s interest rate differentials, and the other is safe haven status while we’ve got these global trade concerns.

2018-09-28,"BERLIN, Sept 28 (Reuters) - German carmakers may offer owners of vehicles affected by driving bans vouchers for hardware upgrades by suppliers such as Baumot or HJS, German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported on Friday, without citing sources. That would be a compromise between some German politicians who want BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen to pay for the cost of making older diesel vehicles cleaner and the carmakers who say hardware retrofits would be much too expensive. The report by FAZ comes ahead of a diesel summit at the German chancellery on Friday, in which the government will try to agree by an end-September deadline a way to tackle pollution from diesel vehicles without resorting to further driving bans. Any solution is likely to cost several billion euros, and Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer said this week his plan would not require taxpayer funds or money from the car owners, putting the onus on carmakers instead. A coalition committee is to meet on Monday to sign off on any decisions. FAZ said the voucher scheme would apply to some diesel vehicles meeting the Euro 5 emissions standard and would cover 80 percent of the cost of upgrades, up to a maximum level of 3,000 euros ($3,500) per vehicle, FAZ said.

Japan’s Nikkei stock index rose as high as 24,286.10 points, reaching its highest levels since November 1991, on renewed optimism about the global economy and hopes of a boost to exporters’ earnings from a weaker yen. It was last up 1.5 percent. Shares elsewhere in Asia also rose, with MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan adding 0.1 percent. But shares in Europe are expected to waver after Italy’s government targeted its budget deficit at 2.4 percent of gross domestic product for the next three years, defying Brussels. Markets had expected Italian Economy Minister Giovanni Tria to resist a spending push by Italy’s coalition government, which took power in June. Financial spreadbetters expect London’s FTSE to open 0.1 percent higher at 7,553, Frankfurt’s DAX to open 0.02 percent lower at 12,433 and Paris’ CAC to open 0.2 percent lower at 5,530. Shares in China were higher ahead of a week-long national holiday. Blue chips gained 0.8 percent and the country’s main Shanghai Composite index was 0.7 percent higher. “Even though we’re at historic highs across a group of global indices, the interesting thing today and yesterday is that it’s translating through to dollar strength,” said Nick Twidale, chief operating officer at Rakuten Securities Australia. “Over the last couple of months, dollar strength and equities haven’t gone hand in hand, but I think because of the Fed move we’ve seen that change in dynamic,” he said. Australian shares rose 0.7 percent, while Seoul’s Kospi gave up ground, falling 0.7 percent after hitting three-month highs on Thursday. S&P E-mini futures crept higher on Friday to 2,921.25 after gains on Wall Street overnight. After the Fed raised rates on Wednesday, the third time this year, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said on Thursday that the United States does not face a large chance of a recession in the next two years and the Federal Reserve plans to keep gradually raising interest rates. But Citi analysts cautioned in a note that not all data was reassuring. “The Citi US Economic Surprise Index has been pushed into negative territory by disappointing housing data in the United States,” they wrote. “The latest data confirms that the housing market continues to be less than ideal. Pending home sales, a leading indicator, declined to the lowest level in seven months.” Pending home sales fell 1.8 percent month-on-month versus consensus expectations for a 0.5 percent drop, they said. The bullish outlook for the U.S. economy continued to lift the dollar, which was up 0.1 percent against the yen at 113.49 , and earlier touched a new 2018 high of 113.63. “There’s a couple of reasons that the dollar’s going to remain popular,” said Twidale. “One’s interest rate differentials, and the other is safe haven status while we’ve got these global trade concerns. It’s nothing new, but I think we could see an acceleration.” The euro rose 0.1 percent to 1.1650 after dropping more than 0.8 percent on Thursday on uncertainty over Italy’s budget deficit. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was up 0.06 percent at 94.947. U.S. Treasury yields ticked lower. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 3.0463 percent on Friday, compared with its U.S. close of 3.055 percent on Thursday. The two-year yield, closely tied to expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 2.8310 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.835 percent. U.S. crude was 0.3 percent higher at $72.32 a barrel. Brent crude was up 0.1 percent at $81.79 per barrel. Gold was slightly higher after tumbling 1 percent on Thursday on strength in the U.S. dollar, which made bullion more expensive for buyers using other currencies.

2018-09-28," (This Sept 27 story corrects day of week in first paragraph to Thursday from Friday.) HAMBURG (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) is prepared to support hardware retrofits for older diesel vehicles and offer incentives for drivers to swap some older diesel vehicles for newer ones, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday. VW Chief Executive Herbert Diess pledged to back a solution to help fund installing more effective exhaust filters during a conversation with German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer on Wednesday, Germany’s Spiegel Online said. The agreement comes as the German government is due to hold a diesel summit on Friday with Scheuer, who has ruled out a taxpayer contribution to possible retrofits. Volkswagen has rejected a proposal that carmakers should buy back older diesel vehicles, the person further said. VW agreed to fit older diesel vehicles with better catalytic converters, reversing its position and bowing to political pressure which mounted in the three years since an emissions cheating scandal, Spiegel Online said. German cities have been sued by environmental groups for repeatedly flouting European clean air rules, a step that has led courts to propose banning of older diesel vehicles as a way to cut pollution from particulate matter and nitrogen oxides. Carmakers are now scrambling to avert outright banks of diesel vehicles.

2018-09-28,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany’s biggest power supplier E.ON wants smart homes to be smart business in a world of decentralized, low-carbon energy markets. That’s why it teamed up this week with U.S. tech giant Microsoft to produce a digital dashboard of all the electrical devices in a home, from heating systems to solar panels to battery storage systems to electric cars. Set to go on sale next year, E.ON’s home energy management system will be one of a range of products on offer from big German utility companies desperate to increase profits from their networks of millions of electricity and gas customers. Faced with the prospect of flat earnings from just selling power, German utilities are offering products from smoke alarms, electronic door locks, EV charging kits, broadband and even the Amazon Prime delivery service to generate higher returns. They’re also trying to get as many new customers as possible on board now to build brand loyalty for when complex smart homes become the norm rather than the exception - and need cutting-edge technology to run efficiently. Since E.ON announced plans in March to merge with rival Innogy, it has stepped up a race with Vattenfall, EnBW and smaller utilities to persuade German customers to switch providers, offering signing bonuses such as iPads, washing machines or hundreds of euros in cash. “The value of customers today is different from three to four years ago because customers have become more active,” said Victoria Ossadnik, chief executive of E.ON’s retail division Energie Deutschland. A study by consultants McKinsey & Company www.mckinsey.com showed that pre-tax earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) from downstream power activities in the European Union will grow by a third to 20 billion euros in the 10 years to 2025. But none of the increase will come from classic power supply, said McKinsey's Tiziano Bruno, one of the authors of the study here published in May. Bruno said the increase will come from a 5 billion euro  ($5.9 billion) rise in the value of energy efficiency services to 9 billion - and that’s why utility companies are set on ring-fencing customers now and coming up with new products. Investors welcome the shift after years of underperformance by utilities when low wholesale power prices led to operational losses and fossil-fuel plants were driven out of the market by renewable energy in Germany’s drive towards low-carbon energy.  ""German utilities have woken up and are working hard to ensure the customer side does not slip through their fingers,"" said Thomas Deser, a fund manager at Union Investment union-investment.com/home.html which holds 1.4 percent of E.ON's shares. “If they manage to combine software, hardware and services, there is a great chance they’ll keep working with the customer.” E.ON already has 6 million private residential accounts in Germany - besides companies, municipalities and cities - and its drive for new clients helped it add 50,000 in the first six months of 2018. Once it combines forces with Innogy next year, it will command a customer base of 50 million retail clients across Europe in countries such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden, Italy, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. Engaged in a similar offensive, Vattenfall, which has 3.5 million German household power accounts, has added 100,000 power and gas customers so far this year, German chief Tuomo Hatakka told Reuters this month. EnBW has 5.5 million household customers in Germany. One of the challenges for big utility companies is to ensure they can hang onto new customers to make the cost of acquiring them worthwhile - and to develop brand loyalty for the future. Germany's Bundesnetzagentur here, the regulator for several sectors including electricity and gas, said 4.6 million people switched power accounts in 2016 while 2.4 million negotiated improved terms with their existing supplier. Ralf Kurtz, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers www.pwc.com, estimates that power companies will need to keep new clients for at least two years for the exercise to become viable. The utilities then need to ensure they are the ones offering products that will let people manage their energy supplies in an efficient way - rather than allowing disruptors with experience of consumer data and digital market places to steal the show. Announcing its deal with Microsoft to create a digital dashboard of electrical devices, E.ON said the market for home management systems in Europe was 40,000 a year, but this could rise to at least 200,000 within three years. “Digitisation, Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence provide us with new opportunities to offer customers increased efficiency and convenience,” said E.ON board member Karsten Wildberger.  ‘UTILITY-IN-A-BOX’  State-owned development bank KfW www.kfw.de/kfw.de-2.html said in a study last month that while only 11 percent of German households use smart energy devices to optimize electricity and heat consumption, 57 percent can imagine using them. Digital smart meters, which monitor consumption and feed data back to power suppliers, have yet to take off in Germany, unlike other EU countries such as Italy and the United Kingdom. The expected demand in Germany for more smart energy devices is why the big power companies are scouring the market to snap up promising startups to ensure they stay in the driving seat. “An organization that has to involve itself with its daily business is unlikely to simply be able to produce disruptive innovation,” said Uli Huener, head of innovation at EnBW. It has adopted a three-pronged strategy: it lets employees develop ideas in an internal “incubator”, it has put 100 million euros into the EnBW New Ventures fund to buy minority stakes in startups and it also has set up an internal company builder to help get innovative ideas up and running. A division of E.ON called :agile said on Wednesday it had chosen six European startups with energy related products for a three-month sponsorship program with a view to starting pilot schemes that could lead to commercial products. E.ON already cooperates with companies such as tado www.tado.com and Nuki nuki.io/en offering smart products like thermostats and electronic door locks and last month it also joined EnBW and Berlin's investment bank IBB here in a financing round for startup Lumenaza www.lumenaza.de/en. The German software company has developed a system it calls utility-in-a-box that monitors renewable power production, manages groups balancing supply and demand, links renewable producers to customers and organizes billing. Creating digital marketplaces for renewable energy suppliers from a wind farm to a home is seen as a significant opportunity in Germany where there are already 1.7 million private households with solar panels.  “The realization that the energy future is green, fragmented and decentralized has now arrived at the highest management level,” said Lumenaza’s managing director Christian Chudoba.

2018-09-28,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China still has to address a series of “weak links” in enforcing pollution rules, the environment ministry said on Friday after publishing its latest investigations into the compliance records of seven provinces and regions. China has been sending inspection teams across the country to find out whether local authorities have tackled environmental failings uncovered during previous probes.  Of the 531 violations identified in the provinces of Shanxi, Liaoning, Anhui, Fujian, Hunan and Guizhou, as well as the municipality of Tianjin, 313 had already been fixed by mid-September, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment said on its website (www.mee.gov.cn). But some regions were “chasing success” when it comes to fixing environmental problems and were not doing enough to rectify violations, it said. China has been taking action against officials for failing to implement state policies as part of the government’s four-year war on pollution.  The environment ministry has previously said that it had uncovered dozens of acts of fraud, including equipment tampering, by local governments and enterprises, and complained in June that some authorities continued to prefer form over substance when it came to rectifying environmental problems. In recent inspection campaigns, China has been focusing on the cleaning up of “black and stinking” urban water supplies and the removal of illegal construction on protected nature reserves. It has sought to enforce new emissions standards in sectors like steel and thermal power.    In documents published by the ministry on Friday, local governments said they were now planning to spend heavily to try to comply with state environmental policies. Southwestern China’s Guizhou, one of the country’s poorest regions, said it had accumulated a total “multi-channel” fund of 53 billion yuan ($7.7 billion) to spend on improving drinking water supplies, building urban environmental infrastructure and treating pollution caused by livestock farming and heavy metal mining. China’s biggest coal producing region of Shanxi has also set up a environmental fund of 3.29 billion yuan dedicated to improving air, water and soil quality, it said.

2018-09-28,"* Agriculture, manufacturing support growth * PM says 2018 GDP growth could reach 7 pct * U.S.-China trade spat posts both risks and opportunities (Adds comments from Capital Economics in paras 11, 12) By Mai Nguyen HANOI, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Vietnam’s economy is estimated to have grown 6.98 percent over January-September this year, the fastest nine-month growth since 2011, buoyed by upbeat production in manufacturing and agricultural sectors, the General Statistics Office (GSO) said on Friday. The Southeast Asian nation recorded strong growth in agriculture and moderate expansion in manufacturing and services in the nine-month period, while processing and manufacturing industries continued to be the main growth driver for the economy, GSO said. The third-quarter growth rate was 6.88 percent, accelerating from the second-quarter growth of 6.73 percent, but lower than the first-quarter growth rate of 7.45 percent, GSO said. “Growth in the first nine months showed many positive results ... but there are still many challenges especially in the background of the China-U.S. trade war,” GSO General Director Nguyen Bich Lam told a news conference on Friday. The Vietnamese economy’s openness index is increasing very quickly, with the index in the first nine months of 2018 hitting 229.5 percent, compared with 215.9 percent in 2017 and 119.7 percent in 2016, Lam added. The Asian Development Bank on Wednesday lowered Vietnam’s 2018 economic growth forecast for Vietnam to 6.9 percent from 7.1 percent projected previously, partly due to an ongoing trade friction between the United States and China. The escalating trade friction between the United States and China poses a threat to Vietnam due to knock-on effects for countries such as Vietnam, which export intermediate goods to China, while weaker global demand will also act as a drag on growth prospects, research firm Capital Economics said in a report on Friday, projecting Vietnam’s growth rate to slow down from 7 percent this year to 6 percent in 2019 and 2020. However, Lam said the trade spat has not yet affected Vietnam’s exports to the United States. Vietnam could seek opportunities to boost exports and welcome foreign investments, while maintaining risks such as transhipment to avoid tax, similar tariffs imposed on Vietnam and global trade contraction, he added. Trade surplus in the first nine months reached $5.39 billion, with exports rising 15.4 percent from the same period last year to $178.91 billion, while imports rose only 11.8 percent to $173.52 billion, GSO data showed. “While we think the economy will continue to expand at a decent pace over the coming years, the rate of growth will probably slow down,” Capital Economics added. Vietnam’s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said on Thursday the country’s economic growth this year could exceed target to grow 7 percent. The Southeast Asian nation last year grew 6.81 percent last year, the strongest pace since 2010, the General Statistics Office had said.

2018-09-28,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Oil majors are set to gather in Rio de Janeiro on Friday to unveil bids for stakes in Brazil’s high potential offshore areas ahead of elections that are casting a cloud of uncertainty over the industry. The auction for four blocks in the Santos and Campos basins comes just a week before presidential polls featuring some candidates seeking to slow oil auctions, revise market-friendly legislation or even claw back areas already awarded. Nevertheless, executives at many of the world’s top oil companies downplayed fears of a dramatic shift, flagging a history in Brazil of certainty for business regardless of political shifts. “We have a good portfolio, and we agree that this country respects contracts,” said Andre Araujo, Royal Dutch Shell’s Brazil country manager, on the sidelines of a Rio oil conference this week. Lured by world class geology, shrinking reserves and rising oil prices, companies have already dropped billions in Brazil, Latin America’s top oil producer, to lock in stakes in its pre-salt layer, where billions of barrels of oil are trapped under a thick layer of salt offshore. Shell, China’s CNOOC, Chevron Corp, BP , Exxon, Norway’s Equinor, and France’s Total are among 12 companies registered to participate in the latest auction. Their interest has been fanned by industry-friendly policies under center-right President Michel Temer, including loosening rules favoring local suppliers, tax sweeteners and the removal of a requirement that state oil giant Petrobras be sole operator in pre-salt blocks. But the hot competition may actually scare some companies away. Germany’s DEA AG, which is registered to take part, may not bid, according to Chief Executive Officer Maria Moraeus Hanssen. “There are things in Brazil that we cannot do because we don’t have the balance sheet to do it,” she said on the sidelines of an oil conference in Mexico. Right-wing Brazilian presidential frontrunner Jair Bolsonaro has said little about the oil sector, although he has floated the idea of privatizing Petrobras and says he would champion a market-friendly approach. Fernando Haddad, a leftist in No. 2 spot in the polls, has a more nationalistic view, vowing to favor local suppliers and ensure the presalt blocks help Brazilians instead of foreign oil companies. The fiercest bids this week are expected to be for the Tita and Saturno blocks in the Santos basin, which were withdrawn by a court from a prior auction in March, disappointing Exxon.

2018-09-28,"HANOI, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Vietnam’s coffee exports for the January-September period is expected to have grown 19.6 percent from the same period a year ago, while rice exports rose an estimated 7.6 percent during the same period, government data showed on Friday. Coffee exports from Vietnam will rise an estimated 19.6 percent between January and September from a year ago to 1.46 million tonnes, equal to 24.3 million 60-kg bags, the General Statistics Office said in a report on Friday. That brings the total coffee exports from Vietnam’s 2017/2018 crop to 1.8 million tonnes, up 12.95 percent from the previous crop, the data showed. Coffee export revenue for Vietnam, the world’s second- biggest producer of the robusta bean, remained the same as last year at $2.76 billion in the nine-month period, the report said. September coffee exports were estimated at 130,000 tonnes, worth $225 million. Rice exports in January-September from Vietnam were forecast to rise 7.6 percent from a year ago to 4.93 million tonnes. Revenue from rice exports in the period was forecast to grow 22.1 percent year-on-year to $2.48 billion. September rice exports from Vietnam, the world’s third-largest shipper of the grain, were recorded at 400,000 tonnes, worth $190 million.

The most-active Brent crude futures contract, for December , had risen 18 cents, or 0.22 percent, to $81.56 per barrel by 0126 GMT. That was close to a four-year high of $82.55 struck on Tuesday. With the expiration of the Brent November futures contract later on Friday, the front-month contract will become the December contract. U.S futures were up 21 cents, or 0.29 percent, at $72.33 per barrel, on track for a weekly gain. “The market has been focusing on trading headlines on the Iran sanctions for a whole week. But views on how much OPEC and Russia can make up for the losses vary,” said Chen Kai, head of commodity research at Shenda Futures. The sanctions kick in on Nov. 4, with Washington asking buyers of Iranian oil to cut imports to zero to force Tehran to negotiate a new nuclear agreement and to curb its influence in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia is expected to quietly add extra oil to the market over the next couple of months to offset the drop in Iranian production, but is worried it might need to limit output next year to balance global supply and demand as the United States pumps more crude. Two sources familiar with OPEC policy said Saudi Arabia and other producers discussed a possible production increase of about 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC allies. However, ANZ said in a note on Friday that major suppliers were unlikely to offset losses due to the sanctions estimated at 1.5 million bpd. At its 2018-peak in May, Iran exported 2.71 million bpd, nearly 3 percent of daily global crude consumption. The nation is OPEC’s third-largest producer. Meanwhile, looming supply from the United States and stable output from Libya were dragging on oil prices, said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore.

2018-09-28,"SHANGHAI, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Shares in Asia inched higher on Friday, following gains on Wall Street overnight after news of robust U.S. economic growth, with the chairman of the Federal Reserve saying the United States does not face a large chance of near-term recession. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.02 percent in early trade in Asia. Australian shares were 0.5 percent higher, while Seoul’s Kospi was down 0.5 percent after hitting three-month highs on Thursday. Japan’s Nikkei stock index gained 1.1 percent, putting it within sight of a 2018 high of 24,129.34 points on Jan. 23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.21 percent to 26,439.93 on Thursday, the S&P 500 gained 0.28 percent to 2,914 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.65 percent to 8,041.97. S&P E-mini futures edged higher to 2,921.5 on Friday. After the Fed raised rates on Wednesday, the third time this year, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said on Thursday that the U.S. does not face a large chance of a recession in the next two years and the Federal Reserve plans to keep gradually raising interest rates. But Citi analysts cautioned in a note that not all data was reassuring. “The Citi US Economic Surprise Index has been pushed into negative territory by disappointing housing data in the United States,” they wrote. “The latest data confirms that the housing market continues to be less than ideal. Pending home sales, a leading indicator, declined to the lowest level in seven months.” Pending home sales fell 1.8 percent month-on-month versus consensus expectations for a 0.5 drop, they said. The bullish outlook for the U.S. economy continued to lift the dollar, which rose 0.04 percent against the yen to 113.4 after touching a 2018 high of 113.46 on Thursday. The single currency was down 0.04 percent on at$1.1636, and faces more pressure after Italy’s government on Thursday defied EU requirements that it cut its deficit, targeting a budget deficit at 2.4 percent of gross domestic product for the next three years. Markets had expected Italy’s economy minister, Giovanni Tria, to resist a spending push by Italy’s coalition government, which took power in June. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was up 0.1 percent at 95.003. U.S. Treasury yields ticked lower. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 3.0462 percent on Friday, compared with its U.S. close of 3.055 percent on Thursday. The two-year yield, closely tied to expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 2.831 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.835 percent. U.S. crude was 0.03 percent higher at $72.14 a barrel. Brent crude fell 0.1 percent to $81.63 per barrel. Gold was slightly higher after tumbling 1 percent on Thursday on strength in the U.S. dollar, which made bullion more expensive for buyers using other currencies. On Friday morning, spot gold was up 0.1 percent at $1,183.48 per ounce. Reporting by Andrew Galbraith

2018-09-28,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday eased safety rules on offshore oil and gas production put in place after the deadly 2010 BP Plc Deepwater Horizon disaster, as part of its effort to slash regulations and boost the energy industry. The Interior Department revised the 2016 oil and gas production safety systems rule, part of a series of regulations the Obama administration enacted on offshore drilling and production after the drilling well disaster that killed 11 oil rig workers, led to the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history and cost BP about $65 billion. The final rule will appear in the federal register as soon as Friday, according to a document seen by Reuters.  It eliminates or changes some safety standards for when a well is producing oil or gas, such as requiring that independent third parties certify devices. Other changes involve when operators have to notify the government about beginning oil and gas production and what they have to report about equipment failures.  The Interior Department said in the rule that “certain provisions in that (2016) rulemaking created potentially unduly burdensome requirements for oil and natural gas production operators on the Outer Continental Shelf, without meaningfully increasing safety of the workers or protection of the environment.” The rule supports the administration’s “objective of facilitating energy dominance” it said. The move was praised by industry but decried by environmentalists.  “We have a rule that is not a safety rollback, but instead incorporates modern technological advances,” Randall Luthi, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, said on Thursday. Athan Manuel, director of lands protection at the Sierra Club, said the revisions were an “example of this administration’s shameless attempts to please corporate polluters, no matter the cost to workers’ safety, our health, or the environment.” (This story has been refilled to correct name of rule and clarify that the Deepwater Horizon disaster occurred on a drilling rig, in paragraph 2)  Reporting by Timothy Gardner; Editing by Peter Cooney",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-offshore-oil/corrected-u-s-interior-dept-relaxes-rules-on-offshore-oil-gas-production-idUKL2N1WD1ZH,28 Sep 2018,"The Trump administration on
