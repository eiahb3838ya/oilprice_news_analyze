2018-03-29,"MONTREAL/DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Nations’ aviation agency is trying to facilitate talks between Qatar and its neighbours to defuse tensions over alleged airspace violations, but will not intervene politically in the dispute, two sources familiar with the matter said this week. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is working to organise a regional meeting for Gulf civil aviation and air traffic authorities in the next few weeks, as part of broader efforts to improve communication, one of the sources said. Earlier this week, the United Arab Emirates accused Qatari fighter jets of flying dangerously close to two of its civilian aircraft, the latest of several incidents raising tension in the region. “Sometimes if you’re having a feud with your neighbour you need someone to facilitate the conversation,” the source said.  Montreal-based ICAO cannot impose binding rules on governments, but wields clout through its safety and security standards which are approved by its 192 member states. ICAO spokesman Anthony Philbin said by email that the agency is “presently monitoring these incidents and working with all of the countries concerned to help keep the skies in this part of the world open, safe, and secure.”     ICAO’s governing council, however, is not planning to intervene in these latest disputes over airspace infringement, said the second source. Improving communication is key because Qatar has limited airspace and is part of Bahrain’s Flight Information Region, the first source said. Both aviation industry sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential. Bahraini, Qatari, and UAE officials could not be reached for comment. Since January, the Gulf states have traded accusations over infringements of their respective airspace. In June 2017, the UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Egypt cut political, economic and transport ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting Islamist extremists. Qatar denies the accusations. The dispute has the potential to disrupt flights in a region with millions of travellers each year. Qatar Airways has flown longer routes since the UAE blocked it from its airspace. A passenger jet belonging to Dubai’s Emirates, the region’s biggest airline, was involved in a January incident when two Qatari air force jets allegedly flew dangerously close.  Doha denies the allegations.  In June, ICAO’s governing council is expected to hear arguments by the Gulf states over the boycott, which Qatar is challenging, said the second source. ICAO last year helped Qatar Airways access contingency routes over international waters. (The story Corrects to show that ICAO has 192 member states, not 191, in fifth paragraph.)

2018-03-29,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is seriously considering abandoning efforts to remake the nation’s biofuel laws after wading deep into an issue that divides some of his core constituencies, according to three sources familiar with the administration’s thinking. Advisers have urged Trump to instead let Congress tackle the biofuel reforms, but use the threat of administrative action to help rival lawmakers come together and solve the intractable issue. The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) has created reliable demand for corn farmers in the nation’s heartland, but merchant refiners like Valero Energy Corp say the costs to comply with the program have taken a huge financial toll. The largest and oldest U.S. East Coast refinery, Philadelphia Energy Solutions, filed for bankruptcy in January, blaming its financial woes on the biofuels program and drawing Trump into the debate over fears of blue-collar job losses in the politically important state of Pennsylvania. Trump’s efforts to reform the programme have angered lawmakers and farmers from red states like Iowa and Nebraska and U.S. oil majors that do not mind if their competitors struggle, leaving the president little safe political ground to manoeuvre. The White House has hosted a series of meetings in recent months in an attempt to change the decade-old RFS, which requires refiners to cover the price of blending biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the fuel supply, creating a lucrative market for growers but a headache for refiners who say it costs them a fortune. Changes considered included potentially capping the price of blending credits that refiners must acquire to show compliance with the law. But the effort exposed gaping divisions between the corn and oil lobbies, along with disagreements between integrated refiners like BP Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp and merchant refiners like PBF Energy Inc, over solutions. But any action by the White House would upset at least one faction of Trump’s base, according to the sources, who asked not to be named as they were discussing a confidential matter.  “This seems like the logical place to land, given all the unrest,” said one of the sources.  Two of the persons said Trump had agreed to heed his advisers’ recommendation to leave the issue to Congress, while leaving open the option to act if Congress balks. The third source said it was not yet clear what Trump would do. White House spokeswoman Kelly Love did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Officials at the Environmental Protection Agency - which administers the RFS - and the U.S. Department of Agriculture also did not respond to requests for comment. EPA head Scott Pruitt and Agricultural Secretary Sonny Perdue have been compiling a list of executive and administrative-level options for Trump to consider to tweak the RFS, the sources said. The list would likely include caps on compliance credits and lifting summertime restrictions on the use of higher-ethanol blends of gasoline. Two sources said the White House would likely make an announcement on its plans in the next two weeks.  Shifting the issue to lawmakers would put the spotlight on U.S. Senator John Cornyn, the Texas Republican who has been leading legislative efforts to reform the RFS. Cornyn’s office says it has been trying to win support from the corn and oil industries for a comprehensive reform bill that is still being drafted. Last year, independent refiners and billionaire Carl Icahn, who owns refining company CVR Energy, sought to convince the administration to overhaul the rule unilaterally. Icahn came under fire for those efforts during a brief period when he was advising Trump, as he attempted to broker a deal with the biofuels industry to change the rule.

2018-03-29,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. power company FirstEnergy Corp (FE.N) urged the federal government on Thursday to evoke little-used emergency powers to help it keep several struggling nuclear and coal-fired power plants open, a move critics blasted as an attempt at a corporate bailout. On Wednesday, Ohio-based FirstEnergy said it would shut several nuclear plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania in the next three years without some kind of state or federal relief. FirstEnergy’s FirstEnergy Solutions unit called on U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry to use the emergency powers to order PJM Interconnection, the regional power grid operator, to negotiate a contract that would compensate owners of coal and nuclear plants for the benefits such as reliability and jobs those units provide.  PJM, in response, rejected the need for an emergency order. “Nothing we have seen suggests there is any kind of emergency from these units retiring,” said Vincent Duane, senior vice president at PJM, calling the problem “fundamentally a corporate issue.” A spokesman for FirstEnergy Solutions declined to comment on Thursday about speculation the unit was headed for bankruptcy, but he directed attention to a filing the company made with the Energy Department earlier in the day. The filing included a comment made by FirstEnergy Corp’s chief executive, Charles Jones, in February that he would be “shocked” if FirstEnergy Solutions did not file for some type of bankruptcy protection by the end of March. Coal and nuclear power plant operators have struggled in recent years as low natural gas prices as a result of the shale boom have spurred utilities to retire dirtier coal plants. Last year, Perry proposed a plan that would subsidize coal and nuclear for providing what is known as base-load generation, which refers to units that run around the clock.  U.S. regulators rejected that proposal in January and said they would conduct a study on grid resilience. Many grid operators, including PJM, have said they already factor in reliability of their systems and the fuel resources available to generate electricity. Murray Energy Corp, which supplies coal to FirstEnergy and has been lobbying elected officials to keep coal and nuclear plants operating, said it fully supports the request for emergency relief. “As a result of FERC’s failure, critical power plants will close, thousands of American jobs will be lost, and the reliability, resiliency, and security of our electric power grids will be forever compromised,” Murray Energy said in a statement, referring to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s rejection of Perry’s resiliency proposal. FirstEnergy said in November 2016 that it would exit the competitive generation business overseen by FirstEnergy Solutions as natural gas has taken up a greater part of the power load.  On Wednesday, FirstEnergy Solutions said it told PJM it would retire all of its nuclear reactors in Ohio and Pennsylvania, totaling 4,048 megawatts (MW), in 2020 and 2021. One megawatt is enough power for 1,000 U.S. homes. FirstEnergy said it wants an emergency order because the power grid’s reliability is threatened, due to the “premature retirement of plants that have many years of useful life but cannot operate profitably under current market conditions.” PJM said, however, that FirstEnergy’s assets “have been financially stressed for some time.”  The Energy Department said it received FirstEnergy’s request and will go through its standard review process. It did not comment further. PJM said such a request, if granted, would effectively circumvent FERC, putting it in “uncharted waters.”  Shares in FirstEnergy closed down 1.1 percent to $34.01 on Thursday. The use of emergency orders related to power generation has been minimal, having been evoked only eight times since December 2000, according to the Energy Department, usually in response to natural disasters or blackouts. Groups that rarely agree on anything condemned FirstEnergy’s request. The American Petroleum Institute (API), a trade group for the oil and natural gas industry, said, “FirstEnergy’s claim that the electric grid would be in immediate danger with these power plant retirements is simply untrue. “PJM is responsible for the reliability of the grid and if there is an emergency, PJM already has the tools to respond,” API said in a statement The environmental group the Sierra Club said it would sue if Perry issues any order to bail out FirstEnergy. “Ratepayers and regulators have already rejected multiple attempts by (FirstEnergy) to bail out these coal and nuclear plants that can no longer compete in the marketplace,” Mary Anne Hitt, director of the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign, said in a statement. Other companies have sought assistance from federal, state and regional officials to keep their coal and nuclear plants in service, and some states, including New York and Illinois, have offered subsidies to nuclear plants. These companies argue that the diversification of fuel sources is necessary to keep the power grid operating in the most optimal way. More coal plants are expected to be decommissioned in coming years, and natural gas recently surpassed coal as the biggest source of power generation in the United States.  Most states are also putting rules in place to boost generation through renewable sources.

2018-03-29,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp roared into Brazil’s prolific offshore oil fields again on Thursday, clinching eight blocks in partnership with other oil firms eager to lap up the country’s choice reserves ahead of presidential elections later this year.   Exxon along with Petrobras and Qatar Petroleum Intl shelled out 2.8 billion reais (£601.3 million) for just one block in Brazil’s offshore Campos basin as the American oil major seeks to replace dwindling reserves. Chevron Corp, Repsol SA, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP Plc and Statoil ASA also spent top dollar to lock down stakes in Brazilian offshore blocks, some of which may be part of the coveted pre-salt play, where oil is trapped under layers of salt beneath the ocean floor.   “We are more confident in investment in Brazil, without a doubt,” said Carla Lacerda, Exxon’s top executive in Brazil, after the round. “We have lots of opportunities ahead. We are analysing each round. We want a robust portfolio here.” Another big winner was Brazil’s cash-strapped government, raking in 8 billion reais ($2.4 billion) of signing bonuses, a record for a concession-style auction and nearly double the 4.6 billion reais it forecast, despite a court’s surprise decision on Wednesday to eliminate the top two blocks from the auction. Behind the resounding success is oil majors’ urgency to lock in stakes in Brazil before a presidential election in October that could bring to power a government seeking to halt or slow private investment in Brazil’s oil sector.  An oil auction earlier this week was less successful in regional rival Mexico, where leading centre-left candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has asked the president to postpone oil auctions if he wins in a July election.  “Brazil has better geology and less political risk than Mexico,” said Adriano Pires, a consultant at Brazil’s Center for Infrastructure. There was a strong showing despite deflated expectations after a Brazilian audit court removed the two most attractive blocks, on the grounds that they should be auctioned under a production-sharing regime to create more value for the government. Now officials aim to auction those blocks in a June pre-salt round.        Exxon, which will operate six of eight blocks it won Thursday, took 10 blocks in a September round last year and a pre-salt block the following month. Before that, it was among the few oil majors without a presence in the exploration of the vast offshore fields discovered off the Brazilian coast over the past decade. Chevron, which has kept a low profile in Brazil since a spill in 2011, won four blocks — its first acquisitions in Latin America’s top economy in five years.  Wintershall, the oil and gas subsidiary of Germany’s BASF, also took seven blocks. Higher oil prices and the need to replace shrinking reserves have boosted appetite among oil majors for costlier, higher-yield offshore ventures, though some projects are still seen as too pricey to be viable. Despite the big bonuses paid to the government, it only awarded 22 of 68 blocks on offer and failed to offload any onshore blocks.

2018-03-29,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is expected to use a Virginia car dealership on Tuesday as the setting to tout its rejection of the Obama administration’s landmark vehicle fuel efficiency rules, a move that could put automakers in the middle of a battle between the Trump administration and California. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt plans to sign a declaration by Sunday that the Obama administration’s vehicle efficiency rules for 2022 through 2025 are “not appropriate” and must be revised, Reuters reported last week.  Pruitt is expected to speak at an event at a Chevrolet dealership in suburban Washington and will joined by groups representing dealers and automakers, according to people familiar with the plans. The state of California, which has the power to effectively create its own fuel economy standards, several allied states and environmental groups are gearing up for a legal and political fight over the rules, aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions from new cars and trucks. California Air Resources Board chair Mary Nichols said in January the board does not believe the standards should be lowered. Pruitt was in California earlier this week, but did not meet with Nichols. Two administration officials and several automakers told Reuters the timing of proposing specific revisions to existing fuel economy standards and emissions limits remains in flux. EPA officials suggested a detailed proposal could come in late May or June, while the Transportation Department is pushing for a speedier proposal, automakers and officials said. The EPA declined Thursday to comment on Pruitt’s plans. An EPA spokeswoman said last week “a final determination will be signed by April 1.” Automakers want rule changes to address lower gasoline prices and a shift in U.S. consumer preferences to larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles. Auto industry executives have not publicly sought specific reductions in the requirements negotiated with the Obama administration in 2011. But they have urged Pruitt and U.S. President Donald Trump to revise the Obama standards to make it easier and less costly to meet complex targets, which vary depending on the size of vehicles and whether they are classified as cars or trucks.  Overall, the Obama rules called for roughly doubling by 2025 to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon the average fuel efficiency of new vehicles sold in the United States. But the Obama rules included a review by April 2018 as to whether the final years were feasible or not. By declaring the Obama rules “not appropriate,” the Trump administration can reopen the process of setting vehicle targets agreed to by automakers in 2011. Pruitt is expected to declare that the existing 2022-2025 model year rules on fuel economy must be revised but he is not expected to immediately propose new requirements, people familiar with the plans said. They asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the news media.  The so-called Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules sought to double the average fuel efficiency of automakers’ fleets, or complete lineup of cars and light trucks, to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025. While automakers want relief from the Obama rules, they are pressing the administration to avoid a battle with California and maintain a single, nationwide set of fuel efficiency requirements. In New York, Toyota North America (7203.T) Chief Executive Jim Lentz said at an Reuters event on Thursday that automakers would face higher costs if they had to manage fuel economy by each individual state. Lentz said individual state emissions requirements could result in Toyota getting “towards the end of the year and I no longer can sell SUVs,” depending on the state’s fuel economy numbers. “It would be an absolute nightmare for us to figure out.” When fuel rules were written in 2011 amid high gas prices, fuel efficiency was the second highest attribute considered by Toyota buyers, Lentz said.

2018-03-29,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks steadied on Thursday, after a woeful week for major technology companies, even as global equities careened towards their first quarterly drop in two years. Shares tracked by the 47-country MSCI index glided 0.86 percent higher, with Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc retaking the market’s leadership mantle. Despite equities’ gains, safe-haven bonds also advanced in price. The volatile give-and-take during the week and quarter would seem to set the table for tense months ahead as buy-the-dip bulls look for corporate earnings to validate the market’s current levels and short-selling bears work to expose investors’ complacency. Yet David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co’s funds division, said he is optimistic that markets have clarified the effects of a large U.S. tax cut and the prospect for higher interest rates, factors he says challenged markets during the first quarter. “It’s not that the uncertainties have gone away on higher rates or lower taxes, but I think we’ve grown accustomed to them, and that should lay a foundation for investors to put more money to work,” he said. Economic data on Thursday showed U.S. consumer spending rising only marginally, but the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropped to a more than 45-year low last week. Monthly inflation readings moderated. Those statistics helped keep downward price swings at bay on Thursday after a turbulent start to 2018 in financial markets that is set to end one of the longest quarterly bull runs and included the biggest-ever rise in Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” the CBOE Volatility Index. A “melt-up” that sent the MSCI’s “all-country” world share index up more than 7 percent in January suddenly melted away as tensions over global trade escalated, turmoil deepened in the White House and market-leading technology firms wobbled on fears of regulation and other issues. The index is down more than 1 percent in price terms this year. Now, the Dow, S&P 500, FTSE, Nikkei and scores of other major indexes are all also down for the year. And there was little place to hide, with U.S. bond returns also in the red for the quarter. On Thursday, by contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 254.69 points, or 1.07 percent, to 24,103.11, the S&P 500 gained 35.87 points, or 1.38 percent, to 2,640.87 and the Nasdaq Composite added 114.22 points, or 1.64 percent, to 7,063.45. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.6 percent, while Shanghai closed up 1.2 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng recovered from an early wobble to add 0.2 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.44 percent. Oil continued its march higher. Benchmark Brent crude rose 1 percent, advancing its gains for the quarter and sidestepping data the day prior showing a surprise build in U.S. crude stockpiles. Many markets across Europe and the Americas will be closed on the final weekday of the quarter in observance of Good Friday. A monthly markets poll by Reuters showed trade war and tech sector worries have spooked global investors into cutting equity exposure to a four-month low and holdings of U.S. stocks to the lowest in nearly two years. Roger Jones, the head of equities at London & Capital, said he hopes the equity market’s selloff from its highs is not prolonged. “The longer this goes, the higher the chance it will start to affect the man in the street,” said Jones. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose in price to yield 2.741 percent, from 2.775 percent late on Wednesday. That market action pushed the gap between short- and long-dated Treasury yields to its tightest in a decade. Some investors see the narrowing as a sign the economy will sputter. In addition to that curve flattening, the quarter was marked by a rise in short-term borrowing costs, reflected in the soaring London interbank offered rate (Libor).

2018-03-29,"NEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters) - A Pennsylvania judge on Thursday urged the state’s public utility commission to reject Buckeye Partners LP’s proposal to reverse the western portion of a 350-mile (560-km) product pipeline that extends from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. Pennsylvania Administrative Law Judge Eranda Vero’s action represented a setback for Buckeye and its efforts to reverse the Laurel Pipeline in the Pittsburgh region to move refined products eastward, which would offer Midwest refiners led by Marathon Petroleum greater access to western Pennsylvania. The state’s Public Utility Commission has the final say on reversal, but the judge’s recommendation carries significant weight. “While we are still reviewing the decision, and we appreciate the administrative law judge’s consideration of our proposal which will create important benefits for Pennsylvania consumers, we respectfully disagree with her conclusion,” Buckeye said in statement. Philadelphia-area refiners such Philadelphia Energy Solutions and Delta Air Lines subsidiary Monroe Energy opposed the reversal, saying it would harm their business and lead to closures. They argued it would take away a key market and cause fuel price spikes in western Pennsylvania. “We commend the judge’s well-reasoned decision. The only winners of a Laurel reversal would be Buckeye and out-of-state refineries,” a coalition of groups, including Philadelphia-area refiners, said in a statement. Vero said Buckeye failed to prove that the pipeline was underutilized and that consumers would be uninjured, among other issues. “Laurel has overstated the overall impact of the decrease on the use of the pipeline section in question,” the judge wrote. The judge also rejected Buckeye’s argument that the company did not need state approval to reverse the line. Midwest refiners such as Marathon and Husky Energy have invested billions of dollars in recent years to take advantage of cheaper Canadian crude. These refiners were hoping to extend their ability to deliver products deeper into Pennsylvania, opening the door for a full reversal all the way to Philadelphia.

2018-03-29,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday as the equities markets rallied and as market participants weighed a rise in U.S. crude inventories and production against continued OPEC supply curbs.  Prices for the more actively traded June Brent crude futures were up 58 cents to settle at $69.34, while the May contract expiring on Thursday was up 74 cents at $70.27. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 56 cents to settle at $64.94. WTI’s discount to Brent has grown to more than $5 a barrel, the biggest since January, making Brent-linked crudes less attractive to refiners. Oil has risen about 4 percent since January, on track for the longest stretch of quarterly gains since late 2010. “The equities market is rallying and that’s lending support to oil,” said Philip Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago. All three major U.S. stock indexes were positive on Thursday.  The dollar against a basket of currencies was flat on Thursday, which was supportive for crude prices, said Streible. A weaker greenback makes dollar-denominated commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies. Strong compliance on supply cuts from members of The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies like Russia have pushed up prices. OPEC sources said the group and its allies are likely to keep their deal on cutting output for the rest of 2018. But growing supply in the United States is pressuring prices. Commercial U.S. stocks rose 1.6 million barrels in the past week, while output hit a record 10.43 million barrels per day (bpd). “I looked at the inventory report as not bearish,” said Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Futures in Chicago. “We actually drew down more from products than from crude.” Geopolitical concerns, especially tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, continued to prop up the market, said Gene McGillian manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford. Meanwhile, “worries about demand being affected by a possible trade war kind of receded,” he said.  But, the gains may be fragile, said Petromatrix strategist Olivier Jakob.  “The price action last week was pretty clear. The objective on that move was to take out the highs of 2018, but that has not been done and the price action of the last three days has not been very convincing.”  The Shanghai crude oil futures contract launched on Monday and has lost about 8 percent since opening.  On Thursday, Reuters reported that China was taking its first steps to pay for imported crude oil in yuan instead of the U.S. dollar.

2018-03-29,"(Recasts; adds quote from source, related content) By Jarrett Renshaw NEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s advisers have urged him to leave U.S. biofuels policy reform efforts to Congress, after months of work to broker a quick-fix deal between rival corn and oil industries got bogged down in dispute. The recommendation to back away underscores the difficulty of getting two key political constituencies to agree on the future of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, a decade-old law that requires refiners to cover the cost of blending biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the fuel supply. The law has created a big new market for farmers, but also a headache for refiners who say costs have soared in the last few years. Trump’s White House has hosted a series of meetings in recent months between representatives of the two sides. The meetings are aimed at finding executive- or administrative-level changes to lower the cost of the program to refiners, including capping the price of blending credits refiners need to prove compliance. They follow failed efforts last year by independent refiners and billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who owns refining company CVR Energy, to convince the administration to overhaul the rule unilaterally. Icahn came under fire early last year during a brief period when he was advising Trump, as he attempted to broker a deal with the biofuels industry to change the rule. He later ended his advisory role amid conflict-of-interest charges, and as those efforts produced forceful reactions from Iowa lawmakers, the nation’s largest corn-producing state. The White House efforts have further exposed gaping divisions between the corn and oil lobbies, and disagreement over the solutions between integrated refiners like BP and ExxonMobil and merchant refiners like PBF Energy . That means any action by the White House will upset at least one faction of Trump’s base, according to the sources, who asked not to be named as they were discussing a confidential matter. Two of the sources said Trump had agreed to heed his advisers’ recommendation to leave the issue to Congress, while also leaving open the option to act if Congress balks. “This seems like the logical place to land, given all the unrest,” said one of the sources. The third source said it was not clear what Trump would do. White House spokeswoman Kelly Love did not respond to a request for comment. Officials at the Environmental Protection Agency - which administers the RFS - and the U.S. Department of Agriculture also did not respond to requests for comment. EPA head Scott Pruitt and Agricultural Secretary Sonny Perdue have been compiling a list of executive and administrative-level options for Trump to consider to tweak the RFS, the sources said. Shifting the issue to lawmakers, however, would put the spotlight on Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn, who has been leading legislative efforts to reform the RFS. Cornyn’s office says it has been trying to win support from the corn and oil industries for a comprehensive reform bill that is still being drafted. Underscoring the stakes, merchant refiner Philadelphia Energy Solutions filed bankruptcy in January, blaming the cost of compliance for its financial woes. Reuters reported that other factors may also have played a role in the bankruptcy, including the withdrawal of more than $590 million in dividend-style payments from the company by its investor owners.

2018-03-29,"CAIRO (Reuters) - President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi cruised towards a landslide election victory against no real opposition but early results showed a lower turnout than the vote that brought him to power in 2014, despite efforts to get more Egyptians to the polls. The vote this week had long been set to hand Sisi a second term after a crackdown against serious contenders left one challenger, widely dismissed as a dummy candidate. Critics say the contest recalled the kind of vote that kept Arab autocrats in power for decades before the 2011 Arab Spring. With the election seen by many, including Sisi, as a referendum on his presidency, the focus is on turnout which he has sought to support tough economic reforms and a fight against Islamist militants. Critics say austerity and an unprecedented crackdown on dissent have eroded Sisi’s popularity, but supporters say such measures are needed to stabilise the North African country after years of unrest that followed a 2011 popular uprising. The former military commander overthrew Islamist Mohamed Mursi, Egypt’s first freely-elected president, after protests against Mursi’s rule in 2013 and was elected a year later. Early estimates by state media on Thursday placed turnout from three days of voting at little over 40 percent, well below the 47 percent of 2014. Sisi is expected to win more than 92 percent of votes, the state media said. He won 97 percent last time. Final results are due on April 2. State-run media trumpeted Sisi’s victory early on Thursday, saying there was a “big turnout”, and radio programmes said that most of the voters were from Egypt’s fast-growing youth. “The people have chosen their president”, the front page of state-run daily al-Ahram said. Sisi said on his official Twitter account: “The images of Egyptians in front of polling stations makes me proud and is proof of the greatness of our nation.” Authorities urged as many eligible voters as possible to cast their ballots, with state media portraying a failure to vote as betrayal of their country. State news agency MENA reported state-run newspapers as saying that between 23 million and 25 million people had voted, out of an electorate of 59 million. On the first two days of voting, turnout was about 21 percent, two sources monitoring the election said, and a Western diplomat said that late on Tuesday it was between 15 and 20 percent. It appeared that more people spoiled their ballots than voted for Sisi’s sole challenger, Moussa Mostafa Moussa, who has widely been dismissed as a dummy candidate, the sources said. “All preliminary reports suggest that turnout is down compared to 2014 despite all the efforts that have been made to raise the numbers,” Timothy Kaldas, non-resident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, said. “But it’s not clear what consequence the turnout will really have on a government that doesn’t appear to believe the people should have a say in who rules them to begin with,” he said. All serious opposition dropped out the election race earlier this year citing intimidation after the main challenger, another former military chief, was arrested. Egypt’s election commission said the vote would be free and fair, and Sisi said he wished more candidates had run. Sisi’s presidency has returned the military to power after turmoil following the 2011 uprising that toppled long-time leader Hosni Mubarak.

2018-03-29,"LONDON (Reuters) - A London court has indicated that it will give the green light to a group lawsuit by around 60,000 English car owners against Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Europe’s largest carmaker, over the “dieselgate” scandal. Lawyers for Slater and Gordon and Leigh Day said on Thursday. they had been awarded a joint legal lead in the lawsuit, which will be the largest in English legal history, subject to any further applications by other law firms. Volkswagen (VW) has said about 11 million cars worldwide were fitted with software that cheated U.S. diesel emissions tests designed to limit noxious car fumes and carbon dioxide (CO2) pollution. About 1.2 million VW, Audi, Skoda and SEAT vehicles are affected in Britain. English lawyers are bringing a series of allegations, including that VW manufacturers defrauded drivers, that “defeat devices” - engine management software designed to mask pollution levels - broke EU rules, that a VW software fix has caused other problems with cars and that drivers overpaid for vehicles. The German company denies the allegations and has said it will defend itself robustly. It says it broke no English laws, that drivers here suffered no loss and that the legal proceedings are premature and unfounded. The court application for a so-called Group Litigation Order (GLO), a key step in the litigation, is expected to be finalised after the Easter break, a spokeswoman for one law firm said. The first pre-trial hearing is expected in early 2019.

2018-03-29,"(Recasts to reflect drop in both soy and corn plantings; adds analyst quote, price reaction) By Mark Weinraub WASHINGTON, March 29 (Reuters) - U.S. farmers will cut their plantings of both soybeans and corn  this spring with supplies of both commodities at record highs, the U.S. Agriculture Department said on Thursday. Soybean plantings, despite the expected drop, will top corn acreage for the first time since 1983, USDA said. Wheat seedings will rise by 3 percent, according to the government’s annual prospective plantings report, which is based on surveys of nearly 83,000 farmers during the first two weeks of March. Corn and soybean futures jumped sharply after the report was released, with both hitting their highest since mid-March. “Obviously it’s a big shock to the market,” said Jack Scoville, analyst at The Price Futures Group. The government said soybean acreage will total 88.982 million in 2018, down from 90.142 million acres a year ago. Analysts’ forecasts for soybean acreage ranged from 89.900 million to 92.600 million, according to a Reuters survey. U.S. soybean supplies as of March 1 totaled 2.107 billion bushels, up 21 percent from a year earlier and the most ever for the period, USDA said in its quarterly stocks report. That was near the high end of market forecasts. Soybean stocks were on the rise as China, the world’s largest soy importer, has focused on Brazilian supplies to meet its needs because the massive crop harvested by U.S. farmers in 2017 had low protein content. USDA predicted that corn acreage will drop to 88.026 million acres from 90.167 million a year ago, near the low end of analysts’ estimates that ranged from 87.550 million acres to 91.000 million. U.S. corn stocks as of March 1 stood at 8.888 billion bushels, up from 8.622 billion bushels a year earlier and also a record for the period. The stocks figure topped analysts’ expectations. Wheat seedings were predicted to rise to 47.339 million acres from 46.012 million a year ago. That compares with analysts’ forecasts for 43.900 million to 47.200 million wheat acres. USDA forecast that farmers will boost their winter wheat seedings and spring wheat other than durum seedings. Durum acreage was seen falling 13.1 percent from 2017. Wheat stocks as of March 1 fell to 1.494 billion bushels from 1.659 billion bushels a year earlier.

Stock indexes tracked by the 47-country MSCI index glided 0.61 percent higher, as trading opened in New York with Facebook Inc, Apple Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc retaking the market’s leadership mantle. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 239.46 points, or 1 percent, to 24,087.88, the S&P 500 gained 25.23 points, or 0.97 percent, to 2,630.23 and the Nasdaq Composite added 68.75 points, or 0.99 percent, to 7,017.98. Despite the equity gains, safe-haven bonds also advanced in price. The U.S. dollar weakened, stalling its sharp rise. The turbulent start to 2018 in financial markets has brought an end to one of the longest quarterly bull runs, and there have been few places to hide. Investors have faced the biggest ever rise in stock volatility, rapidly escalating tensions over global trade, deepening turmoil in the White House and major wobbles in the tech sector. A “melt-up” that sent the MSCI’s world share index up 8 percent in January suddenly melted away. Now, the Dow Jones, S&P 500, FTSE, Nikkei and scores of other major indexes are all down for the year. “We have got to make sure (the market selloff) ...is not too prolonged because the longer this goes, the higher the chance it will start to affect the man in the street,” said Roger Jones, the head of equities at London & Capital. Facebook, Apple and some of their peers were hurt this quarter as investors rethought high U.S. stock valuations in light of the prospect of a U.S.-China trade war and potentially increased regulation of tech companies. Reuters’ monthly markets poll showed the trade war and tech sector worries have spooked global investors into cutting their equity exposure to a four-month low and holdings of U.S. stocks to the lowest in nearly two years. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last rose in price to yield 2.7534 percent, from 2.775 percent late on Wednesday. That pushed the gap between U.S. short- and long-dated Treasuries to its tightest level in a decade. Some investors see a narrowing between those bonds’ yields as a sign the economy will sputter. For currency traders, the dollar settled too after a stronger-than-expected revision to U.S. fourth quarter economic growth data and hopes a nuclear standoff with North Korea has been averted gave it its largest daily gain in nearly seven months on Wednesday. An index of the greenback against its trading partners rose 0.08 percent. A 45-year low in jobless claims helped the tentative return of risk appetite, and U.S. inflation data also cooled safety plays including Treasuries and German Bunds. Oil managed a rebound despite data on Wednesday that showed a surprise build in U.S. crude stockpiles. U.S. crude rose 0.62 percent to $64.78 per barrel and Brent was last at $69.11, up 0.51 percent on the day. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.6 percent, while Shanghai closed up 1.2 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng recovered from an early wobble to add 0.3 percent.

The EU cannot enact it as a whole until all members have done so. The amendment is intended to form a legal framework for CO2 reduction efforts until 2020, when the Paris climate agreement that more than 200 nations signed in late 2015 kicks in. The Doha amendment does not come into effect unless 144 countries ratify it, which 111 states had done as of March 29, according to the United Nations.

First-week sales have surpassed expectations, said George Verberne, an entrepreneur who runs the branch, about 90 km (56 miles) north of the capital, Amsterdam. “We sold about 700 items in one week. It’s double what we sell for organic products,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview. “I’m proud and very happy we’re the first to do it.” Verberne and 18 Dutch companies launched the Verspilling is Verrukkelijk or “Waste is Delicious” initiative last week, supported by a local university as part of a new national programme, United Against Food Waste. The government is aiming to halve the amount of food thrown away by its 17 million people to become the first country in Europe to meet this global development goal by 2030. Globally, one third of all food produced, worth nearly $1 trillion, is thrown away every year, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Critics say this is not only unethical in a world where hunger levels are rising but also environmentally destructive. The Dutch organic chain Ekoplaza set up in February what it said was the world’s first plastics-free supermarket aisle, which has led to calls for others to follow suit. The idea of selling food whose appearance does not meet supermarket standards was born when Verberne saw a presentation on food waste by Toine Timmermans of Wageningen University & Research, and offered to help. Timmermans, who has worked on sustainable food issues for 15 years, asked for shelf space to showcase products made from waste and see how consumers responded. At least 200 entrepreneurs across Europe offer products using surplus food, but they tend to be small and have limited impact, he said in a phone interview. “If you want to solve food waste and achieve sustainable food systems, you need to work with people who have access to the market, like retail stores,” he said. Researchers from the university will monitor sales over the next six months to learn how best to expand the products. Chantal Engelen, co-founder of soup-making Kromkommer, one of 18 companies participating in “Waste is Delicious”, said about 30 percent of carrots get rejected because they have two legs, are too big or too crooked. “We buy them straight from the grower for a fair price and turn them into healthy food,” she said, adding that their ultimate aim is to change consumer behaviour so that the reject carrots are sold in shops and Kromkommer’s work become obsolete. The Netherlands is a small nation but it is one of the world’s largest agricultural exporters. “Waste is Delicious” said it plans to expand to three more supermarkets in the next few months. Timmermans is glad to see that higher pricing than established brands has not deterred customers. “We cannot sell for less, because for the social innovators, this is their source of income,” he said. “So working together and the message, ‘by buying this, you’re contributing to a better world’ is a very important one.” Verberne believes wonky vegetables have a bright future. “A lot of colleagues called me and sent me emails asking, “how does it work? Can I also do something like this?’,” he said. “I think we have to do this. This planet deserves it.” (Reporting By Thin Lei Win @thinink, Editing by Katy Migiro.

2018-03-29,"NEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s advisers have urged him to let Congress take the lead in efforts to lower the cost of the nation’s biofuels policy for refining companies, and to use executive action only if lawmakers fail to make progress, according to three sources familiar with the discussions. The recommendation underscores the difficulties the White House has faced in attempting to tweak the Renewable Fuel Standard, a decade-old law intended to help farmers and reduce fuel imports that has for years divided the corn and oil industries. The RFS requires refiners to cover the price of blending biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the fuel supply, creating a lucrative market for growers but a headache for refiners who say it costs them a fortune. Trump’s White House has hosted a series of meetings in recent months between the key political constituencies aimed at finding executive- or administrative-level changes acceptable to both sides - including potentially capping the price of blending credits that refiners must acquire to prove compliance. But the efforts exposed gaping divisions between the corn and oil lobbies, along with disagreements between integrated refiners like BP and ExxonMobil and merchant refiners like PBF Energy, over solutions. That means any action by the White House will upset at least one faction of Trump’s base, according to the sources, who asked not to be named as they were discussing a confidential matter. Two of the sources said that Trump had agreed to heed his advisers’ recommendation to leave the issue to Congress, while leaving open the option to act if Congress balks. The third source said it was not yet clear what Trump would do. White House spokeswoman Kelly Love did not respond to a request for comment. Officials at the Environmental Protection Agency - which administers the RFS - and the U.S. Department of Agriculture also did not respond to requests for comment. EPA head Scott Pruitt and Agricultural Secretary Sonny Perdue have been compiling a list of executive and administrative level options for Trump to consider to tweak the RFS, the sources said. The list would likely include caps on compliance credits and lifting summertime restrictions on the use of higher-ethanol blends of gasoline. Shifting the issue to lawmakers would put the spotlight on Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn, who has been leading legislative efforts to reform the RFS. Cornyn’s office says it has been trying to win support from the corn and oil industries for a comprehensive reform bill that is still being drafted. Underscoring the stakes, merchant refiner Philadelphia Energy Solutions filed bankruptcy in January, blaming the cost of compliance for their financial woes. Reuters reported that other factors may also have played a role in the bankruptcy, including the withdrawal of more than $590 million in dividend-style payments from the company by its investor owners.

2018-03-29,"(Adds link to graphic) * CEO aims to boost OPEC member’s gas output * Mends ties with Statoil, BP, Total and ENI in first year * Under pressure from budget shortfall, looming election By Lamine Chikhi ORAN, Algeria, March 29 (Reuters) - When the U.S.-educated CEO of Algeria’s state energy company Sonatrach ended a speech to staff by seeking questions, an executive sitting next to him quickly picked up the microphone. “There are no questions,” he said, and some 1,000 employees filed straight out. The scene revealed the scale of the challenge facing Abdelmoumen Ould Kadour, who took over Sonatrach a year ago with a mission to improve communication and transparency in a company that is central to stability in Algeria and beyond. Sonatrach funds 60 percent of the state budget, and falling oil prices have created pressure for change, while Algeria’s role as a major gas supplier to Europe means new tension between the continent and gas giant Russia could play into his hands. He will soon unveil a plan to lift stagnant output and has revived ties with European oil majors. But project delays, fraud scandals, secrecy and red tape abound in a country where adults remember civil war and change is often resisted. “It’s hopeless,” he confided to colleagues accompanying him to the company office in the northwestern city of Oran, one of dozens of such visits by the 66-year-old alumnus of MIT and Harvard to Sonatrach outposts witnessed by Reuters. On his first day, he said on another occasion, he was given so much paperwork to sign he feared he would do little else. “There was no medium and long term strategy, there was no communication, no coordination between Sonatrach’s executives, every single piece of information was confidential.” No stranger to setbacks, he spent two years in an Algerian jail for collaborating with foreigners after a decade in charge of a joint Algerian-U.S. engineering company co-owned by oil services firm Halliburton. He has brought in his own team to lead the revamp at Sonatrach, declining requests for an interview but sharing his views during his tour of the company. A company source said his turnaround plan would be unveiled “within weeks, if not days”. Designed partly to attract foreign investment, it is likely to come during or before a conference he hosts on April 16-18 which the CEOs of France’s Total, Italy’s ENI and Norway’s Statoil are expected to attend. His broad goal is to turn Sonatrach into an integrated energy company by 2030 from its current sprawling state, which includes an aircraft maker and extensive social programmes and excludes renewables, which come under the environment ministry. While Western CEOs will expect concrete steps after years of bold announcements, the plan has spread unease among executives, several of whom told Reuters they feared sweeping management changes in Ould Kadour’s declared battle with red tape. In Oran, he told staff that Statoil, set to resume work at the Hassi Mouina gas field, had previously left because of bureaucracy. “Better communication, a better environment is key to convince foreign partners to work in Algeria,” he said. A Sonatrach source said Statoil is expected to invest $500 mln in gas, a figure described by a Statoil source as “speculation”. Last month Statoil and Britain’s BP agreed to strengthen cooperation in upstream oil exploration and explore solar energy to allow Algeria to export more of its gas. In December Ould Kadour revived ties in December with Total, ENI and Saipem, but his ability to nurture those relationships and reverse years of stalling production will depend on how his company’s 40,000 employees respond to his message of change. He is an unlikely manager in a country known for secrecy and a suspicion of Westerners dating from ties to the Soviet Union and the trauma of the 1954-1962 independence war with France. But energy revenues have halved since 2014 and President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the 81-year old leader who might run for a fifth term next year, is struggling to maintain a welfare state necessary for social stability. The government has launched austerity measures, banning the import of 900 goods and freezing public sector hiring and development projects. Doctors and teachers have been on strike in several cities for three months demanding better pay and conditions and the state has been unable to end dissent by paying out as it did when a barrel of crude cost $100 instead of $70 as now. This has turned improving the efficiency of the state oil company into a political imperative. “Ould Kaddour has no choice but to succeed as Sonatrach’s CEO,” a former energy minister told Reuters. Critics of the CEO say he has only been appointed because of Bouteflika and will last no longer than his many predecessors. “If Bouteflika quits, Ould Kaddour would be sacked in the next five minutes,” a former Sonatrach executive said. With the presidential election looming, Ould Kadour has sought to cut Algeria’s import bill by recruiting oil trader Vitoil to swap crude for the petrol in growing need at home. “The strategy was to show that Algeria, which is a big oil producer, is not spending gigantic sums on imports of products,” an oil insider said. One delayed gas field was brought online last year with three more slated to start producing this year, lifting annual gas output of 94 billion cubic metres by 9 billion cubic metres. Sonatrach has signed a $1 billion deal with Turkey to build a petrochemical facility, discovered crude in Niger and explored cooperation with Iraq. It is also considering shale, but protests in 2015 from Algerians fearing environmental damage have made that politically unpalatable for now. In further signs of a balancing act, company sources say Sonatrach will offer more flexible short-term gas contracts on terms of 10-15 years or less instead of 20-25 and invest $250 million in the Tinhert gas field project using Algerian firms. Ould Kadour’s sentencing by a military court in 2007 on charges working for a foreign country was part of an internal regime conflict typical for Algeria, observers say. An elite made up of the ruling FLN party, army and security has controlled Algeria since independence, with officials or executives of state firms sometimes losing jobs when a new faction takes over in power plays behind closed doors. After serving his two-year jail term, he worked in Qatar, France, Senegal and the United Arab Emirates before Bouteflika made him Sonatrach CEO in March 2017. Anis Rahmani, owner of private Ennahar TV station, said the CEO had told him he was devastated by being branded a traitor. “But the man has vision, a plan to transform the company into a modern and performing one, which is not the case now,” he said. He is more powerful than the energy minister, one insider said, but must also win backing from politicians resistant to opening up the country too much. A key energy law has been stalled for years but a draft is now due in July. It is likely to retain Sonatrach’s majority stake in all energy projects but offer tax incentives for investors, a Sonatrach executive said. “The law needs to be attractive,” he said. “If not it will be useless.” Additional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov in LondonEditing by

2018-03-29,"LONDON (Reuters) - The turbulent start to 2018 in financial markets has finally brought an end to one of the longest ever global bull runs - and there have been few places to hide. After last year’s tranquillity, as the charts below show, investors have had it all thrown at them this quarter, from the biggest ever rise in stock volatility .VIX to rapidly escalating tensions over global trade, deepening turmoil in the White House and major tech sector wobbles. A ""melt-up"" that sent the MSCI's world share index up 8 percent in January suddenly evaporated. Now the Dow Jones .DJI, S&P 500 .SPX, FTSE .FTSE Nikkei .N225 and scores of other big markets are all down for the year.  As a set, the FAANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) are still up over 10 percent, but privacy concerns after it was revealed that 50 million Facebook users’ data was misused has wiped $400 billion off their value. Not exactly small change. “January was a boom month, but there was clearly complacency coming into the market,” said London & Capital’s head of equities Roger Jones. “That has all changed now”. (GRAPHIC - The sinking FAANGs: reut.rs/2GhhYIe) Cryptocurrency Bitcoin BTC=BTSP has lost 43 percent as well. Still, it hasn’t been a one-way “risk-off” doom-fest for markets by any means. Galloping global growth mean commodities like oil LCOc1 are up for a third quarter running, stocks in the world’s poorest ‘frontier’ countries are up 4 percent, and Italian bonds have made almost 6 percent returns despite an inconclusive election. After a stellar 2017, emerging market 'local' currency bonds have done well again too as the Chinese yuan CNY=, Mexican and Colombian pesos MXN=CLP= and South Africa's rand ZAR= have all rallied hard.  So has Britain’s Brexit-bound pound. It has had its best quarter since early 2015 and not only against a dollar GDP=D4 which is locked in its worst run since the financial crisis, but also versus the euro GBPEUR=. “The (political) momentum is to make Brexit work now,” said one central banker privately. What the choppy conditions have also reminded people of is the value of a good old-fashioned safe-haven. Japan's yen JPY= is up over 6 percent, gold XAU= is up for a third straight quarter, and the ultra-safe German Bund has made just over 3 percent in dollar terms as its yields have gone in an almost-perfect arc. DE10YT=RR  But some of the heavyweight central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve, ECB, Peoples Bank of China, Bank of England and Bank of Canada are still looking to raise interest rates. Unlike Bunds, U.S. Treasuries US10YT=RR have lost 3 percent. It is one of the reasons that stocks have been shaky of course, and it remains one of the main things shaping many investors’ view on the rest of the year. “One thing that it is going to be important to get right now is where to be when bond yields are going up,” said SEB investment management’s global head of asset allocation Hans Peterson. “We are rotating from the old regime of low interest and growth stocks like the FAANGs into a new world... and that creates volatility.” (GRAPHIC - Global market performances in Q1: reut.rs/2pQ4fBd) (GRAPHIC - Global FX in 2018: reut.rs/2pPldj5) Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Hugh Lawson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/markets-global-q1/graphic-global-market-bull-runs-out-of-charge-in-q1-idUKL8N1RA69S,29 Mar 2018,"The turbulent start to 2018 in

2018-03-29,"(Peter Apps is Reuters global affairs columnist. The opinions expressed here are his own.) By Peter Apps March 29 (Reuters) - Earlier this month, the USS Carl Vinson became the first American aircraft carrier to visit Vietnam since the Vietnam War ended in 1975. Coming alongside the news that a record 23 nations from Southeast Asia and beyond would be joining biennial naval exercises in the eastern Indian Ocean, it was a potent reminder of just how eager the nations surrounding the South China Sea are to embrace powerful allies to fend off a rising China. But as Beijing’s regional clout continues to grow, it can be hard for weaker nations to resist it, even with these allies’ support. Barely three weeks after the Vinson’s visit, the Vietnamese government bowed to Chinese pressure and canceled a major oil drilling project in disputed South China waters. It was yet another sign of the region’s rapidly shifting dynamics. For the last decade, the United States and its Asian allies have been significantly bolstering their military activities in the region with the explicit aim of pushing back against China. But Beijing’s strength and dominance, along with its diplomatic, economic and military reach, continues to grow dramatically. Over the last week, Beijing has conducted major military drills, including reportedly sending its aircraft carrier through the Taiwan Strait and flying jets between Japan’s southernmost islands (the latter of which was explicitly described by the Chinese military as a preparation for future wars). These drills are both a response to recent U.S. military actions and a bold statement of China’s intent to keep up the pressure. Western military strategists worry that China will, in time, be able to block any activity in the region by the United States and its allies. Already, satellite photos show China installing sophisticated weapons on a range of newly-reclaimed islands where international law says they simply should not be present. In any war, these and other new weapons that China is acquiring could make it all but impossible for the U.S. Navy and other potential enemies of China to operate in the area at all. A simple issue lies at the heart of the problem – Beijing’s claim to sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea basin. That assertion – first made by the exiled Republic of China government in Taiwan in 1947 and then repeated by its mainland communist counterpart since – was flatly rejected by a United Nations tribunal in 2016. But that hasn’t stopped Beijing from doing more and more to secure its position in the area. China’s increasing confidence in asserting control over the South China Sea has clearly alarmed its neighbors, particularly the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei, all of whom have competing territorial claims over waters that China claims for itself. But it also represents a major and quite deliberate challenge to the United States which, as an ally to all these nations, has essentially staked its own credibility on the issue. Over the last several years, it has become common practice for U.S. warships to sail through nearby waters, pointedly refusing to acknowledge Chinese demands that they register with its unilaterally-declared air and maritime “identification zones” (which the United States and its allies do not recognize). The last such voyage – dubbed a “freedom of navigation” operation or, in naval parlance, a “FONOP” – took place on Friday, when the destroyer Mustin reportedly passed within 12 nautical miles of Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands, which is claimed by both China and the Philippines. The Mischief Reef FONOP fits a much wider pattern of increasingly assertive naval activities by Washington and its allies in the region. Earlier this month, the United States announced the first deployment of its cutting-edge F-35B vertical takeoff Joint Strike Fighter – by far the most sophisticated aircraft of its type – to an amphibious assault ship in the region. This kind of military tit for tat appears to be escalating; China now says it plans monthly military exercises in the South China Sea, a substantial increase. That will likely be met by intensified American and allied activity: a British warship is shortly scheduled to conduct its own FONOP, and the United States has pushed Australia to join the program (although whether it will do so remains a topic of considerable debate within the country). None of this, however, addresses the seismic regional change produced by China’s island-building strategy. Over the last five years, China has built ever more sophisticated military and industrial outposts on disputed atolls and reefs, in some cases transforming scrubby patches of rock that barely broke the surface into large concrete installations. Once a tiny fishing station on stilts, Mischief Reef is now a well-armed Chinese military base. And China’s land-reclamation efforts continue, aided by a giant new dredging vessel that its Chinese designers have touted as a “magical island-building machine.” Filipino officials say they believe it is only a matter of time before Beijing makes similar moves at Scarborough Shoal, within striking distance of major Filipino population centers and military facilities. If and when that happens, the Philippines, along with the United States, will face a difficult decision about how best to respond. At stake here are more than energy resources – although the estimated 11 billion barrels of oil and nearly 200 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that the South China Sea is believed to contain are clearly a factor in the conflict. But more broadly, China sees this confrontation as a test case for its ability to impose its will on the wider region – and so far it is winning. (At the very least, foreign energy firms are now unlikely to bid to drill in disputed waters; Spanish oil firm Repsol is said to have lost up to $200 million, after Chinese pressure prompted Vietnam to cancel its planned exploration.) The United States remains the world’s preeminent military superpower, and there is little doubt it could win a fight with China almost anywhere else in the world. In its own backyard, however, Beijing is making it increasingly clear that it calls the shots. And for now, there is little sign anyone in Washington – or anywhere else – has the appetite to seriously challenge that assumption.

2018-03-29,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1 percent in January, Statistics Canada data indicated on Thursday, in a clear sign that first-quarter growth is likely to be weaker than the Bank of Canada had predicted. Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected gross domestic product to increase by 0.1 percent after a revised 0.2 percent gain in December. January’s drop was the first since a 0.1 percent decline in August 2017. In January, the central bank forecast first-quarter annualized growth of 2.5 percent, but it looks set to cut that estimate when it issues updated numbers on April 18. “The underlying story is that growth remains on a sluggish underlying path of less than 2 percent ... for the Bank of Canada, this reinforces the point that there is little urgency to hike rates again,” said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Financial Group. The central bank has raised interest rates three times since last July and says future moves will be heavily dependent on economic data. Analysts noted that January GDP had been hit by temporary factors. Unscheduled maintenance shutdowns at some oil facilities helped cut non-conventional extraction by 7.1 percent while real estate and rental and leasing declined by 0.5 percent as tougher mortgage lending rules took effect. “We expect a bounceback in February and March GDP, but we’re going to revise down our first quarter GDP forecast to sub 2 percent, adding weight to our view that the Bank of Canada is on hold until July,” said Avery Shenfeld of CIBC Economics. Canada’s economy grew a modest 1.7 percent on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter, well below the Bank of Canada’s 2.5 percent forecast. In a note to clients, Krishen Rangasamy and Matthieu Arseneau of NBF Economics and Strategy said they expected first quarter growth of 1.5 percent. Pre-election budgets unveiled this week in Ontario and Quebec - Canada’s two most populous provinces - should then boost growth later in the year, they added. Separately, Statscan said producer prices edged up 0.1 percent in February as a weaker domestic currency boosted the cost of motorized and recreational vehicles.

2018-03-29,"THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The Dutch government said on Thursday it will phase out gas production at the Groningen field, once Europe’s largest, by 2030 as part of efforts to reduce the danger caused by small but damaging earthquakes. Production is set for 21.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) this year, already down from a peak of 53.8 bcm in 2013, following a series of cuts as decades of extraction have led to dozens of earthquakes each year, damaging thousands of homes and buildings.  “Our intention is (to cut production) to get towards 12 bcm in the coming four or five years, and to zero at the end of the coming decade,” Prime Minister Mark Rutte told a press conference. A chart produced by the Dutch Economy Ministry showed production falling to below 20 bcm for the production year beginning October 2018, and to below 17.5 bcm for the 2019 year, assuming average temperatures. Economy Minister Eric Wiebes confirmed there will be reductions in both years, but will not make his official decision on production until he has received advice on safety considerations this summer.  Wiebes said the cuts will be achieved in part by forcing large industrial users to seek other sources of energy by 2022. In addition, the Netherlands is building a conversion plant to make high-calorific foreign gas suitable for use in Dutch systems. Foreign users of Dutch gas in Germany and Belgium will be encouraged to seek other sources, and their contracts not renewed, while Dutch households will be incentivized to reduce gas use and switch to non-gas heating systems. Dutch wholesale prices at the TTF hub were little changed after the statement — both the summer 2018 and winter 2018 contracts were up less than one euro cent, trading at 18.23 euros per megawatt-hour (MWh) and 19.02 euros/MWh respectively. “This is in the neutral to slightly bullish range,” said Oliver Sanderson, a Thomson Reuters gas analyst, of the government’s base case scenario. “Our view for this gas year (Oct 2017-Sept 2018) is around 19 bcm. “However, the Groningen quota should continue to be seen as low and a general cause of price spikes in cold weather,” he said, noting that storages have been depleted after a cold 2018 winter. The government said last month that it intended to cut production at the field from current levels of 21.6 bcm per year to 12 bcm as quickly as possible, after the country’s northern region was hit by the strongest earthquake in years in January.

Wall Street futures were up and banks and consumer stocks helped Europe’s main bourses 0.3-0.9 percent higher as the region built on gains by Asia’s heavyweight Nikkei , Hang Seng and Chinese markets. For currencies traders, the dollar settled too after a stronger-than-expected revision to Q4 growth data and hopes a nuclear standoff with North Korea has been averted gave it its largest daily gain in six months on Wednesday. A 45-year low in jobless claims helped the tentative return of risk appetite, and U.S. inflation data also cooled safety plays including Bunds and Treasuries. Benchmark yields - which move inversely to prices - on German government bonds crept back above 0.5 percent, having been on a sharp slide for most of the month. Spanish yields meanwhile headed for their biggest monthly fall since mid-2016. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was at 2.766 percent after touching a near two-month low of 2.743 percent after Wednesday’s strains on Wall Street. “I think most of these markets are staring at the 200-day moving average on the S&P 500 to see if it breaks,” said Societe Generale’s Kit Juckes. “I think euro/dollar is stuck in its range with superglue... but I think if there is going to be another surprise in Q2 it will be yen strength again.” Wall Street futures were pointing to a marginally higher open. Shares of the so-called FANG group - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet – were up between 0.60 and 1.6 percent in pre-market trading. All three major U.S. indexes ended in the red again on Wednesday with $30 billion wiped off Amazon’s shares alone after reports U.S. President Donald Trump wanted to rein in the firm’s power in online retailing. Including Apple the FAANGs as a set are still up 14 percent so far this year, but privacy concerns in the wake of Facebook’s scandal nearly two week back has wiped $400 billion off their value. The turbulent start to 2018 in financial markets more broadly has brought an end to one of the longest ever quarterly bull runs - and there have been few places to hide.

Now the Dow Jones, S&P 500, FTSE Nikkei and scores of other big markets are all down for the year. “We have got to make sure (the market selloff) ...is not too prolonged because the longer this goes the higher the chance it will start to affect the man on the street,” said the Head of Equities at London & Capital, Roger Jones. Five big themes for the markets next week: Reuters’ flagship monthly markets poll showed the trade war and tech sector worries have spooked global investors into cutting their equity exposure to a four-month low and holdings of U.S. stocks to the lowest in nearly two years. In Asia overnight, Japan’s Nikkei ended up 0.6 percent, Shanghai closed more than 1.2 percent higher and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng recovered from an early wobble to add 0.3 percent. Helping the mood were media reports that Japan had sounded out North Korea’s government about a bilateral summit, and that Pyongyang had also discussed the possibility of a broader meeting with other global leaders. Beijing had said on Wednesday that North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un had pledged his commitment to denuclearisation at meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The greenback was 0.3 percent lower against the yen - often sought in times of market turmoil and political tensions - at 106.46 yen on Thursday. The greenback had rallied 1.4 percent on Wednesday on perceived progress over the North Korea issue, having set a 16-month trough of 104.560 on Monday. The dollar index versus a basket of six major currencies was flat at just under 90 after reaching a one-week high of 90.147. “Expansionary U.S. fiscal policy should support global trade, but markets will remain attentive to further tensions as the China-U.S. trade saga continues to unfold,” wrote economists at ANZ. The euro was 0.1 percent higher at $1.2319 losing 0.75 percent on Wednesday and after German inflation data was not quite as spritely as forecast. Sterling was flat at $1.4080 after shedding 0.5 percent overnight on news British retail sales fell in March for the first time in five months. It has however had its best quarter since early 2015, and not only against a dollar which is locked in its worst run since the financial crisis, but also versus the euro . In commodities, U.S. crude futures slipped 0.2 percent to $64.28 a barrel after dropping 1 percent the previous day when data showed U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly rose last week. Brent shed 0.4 percent to $69.23 a barrel after losing 0.8 percent on Wednesday. Brent has risen more than 6 percent this month though, with OPEC and other suppliers expected to continue withholding output for the rest of the year and potentially into 2019. Gold was steady at $1,323 an ounce. Another sign of the stress in markets is that it is set for its third straight quarterly gain. Reporting by Marc Jones

2018-03-29,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss engineering company ABB (ABBN.S) is considering acquisitions to increase its capabilities in artificial intelligence, Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer said on Thursday. “We will continually further expand the portfolio of ABB,” he said, speaking on the sidelines of the company’s annual general meeting in Zurich. This would include investment in organic growth in artificial intelligence (AI), and partnerships with other companies to accelerate areas such as linking AI to industrial robots.  ABB, whose products also include charging stations for electric cars and massive converters for continent-spanning  transmission systems, would also invest selectively in start-up companies, Spiesshofer said. He was speaking after ABB gave a slightly more upbeat assessment about the development of its markets for 2018, saying  conditions had brightened. The company has navigated a tough couple of years with plummeting demand from its oil, gas and mining customers and has rejected calls from an activist investor to spin off its power grids business. During this time ABB has simplified its structure into four divisions, sold off fringe businesses and exited operations in the low margin and risky engineering and construction area. “If you take our end markets, in the last couple of years there has been a massive contraction in the process industries and uncertainty in some other markets,” Spiesshofer told reporters after the AGM. “2018 is really the first year where we see none of our market segments contracting, they are either stable or growing. That means the world is starting into 2018 with a positive sentiment.” Late cycle businesses - such as machinery for the oil and gas industry - were also stabilizing, he added, with the company seeing “early activities” on operating expenditure and service orders from oil, gas and mining companies. “We see increasing discussion for future projects. So altogether the late cycle will...stop getting worse in 2018 and towards the end of the year we expect the market to get a little better,” Spiesshofer said, although current global trade tensions could have a dampening effect on overall investment sentiment.   U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this month pushed ahead with the imposition of metal tariffs, though he later announced exemptions for some countries, sparking concerns of trade war. Trump last week signed a presidential memorandum targeting up to $60 billion in Chinese goods with tariffs. After ABB’s overhaul, Chairman Peter Voser said now was the time for the company to deliver. “We have outlined the strategy, we have worked on the portfolio both in and out, so the scene is set,” he told reporters. “We have finished, from an operational point of view, the restructuring programs. It is now about execution of the strategy; it is delivery time.” Reporting by John Revill, editing by John Miller and Adrian Croft",https://uk.reuters.com/article/abb-agm-strategy/update-1-abb-on-the-hunt-for-acquisitions-in-artificial-intelligence-idUKL8N1RB3JP,29 Mar 2018,"Swiss engineering company ABB

2018-03-29,"* Shares look to lift gloom after recent tech rout * World shares set for first quarterly loss in 2 years * Dollar steadies as momentum from overnight surge fades * Bond yields, commodity prices edge higher * Japan joins group planning talks with North Korea By Marc Jones LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - Stock markets and other riskier assets steadied on Thursday as investors dusted themselves down after a woeful week for the tech sector, readying for what was set to be the first quarterly drop in global equities in two years. Wall Street futures were up and banks and consumer stocks helped Europe’s main bourses 0.2-0.4 percent higher as the region built on a positive session for Asia’s heavyweight Nikkei, Hang Seng and Chinese markets. For currencies traders, the dollar settled too after a stronger-than-expected revision to Q4 growth data and hopes a nuclear standoff with North Korea has been averted gave it its largest daily gain in six months on Wednesday. The tentative return of risk appetite and looming U.S. inflation data also cooled safety plays including Bunds and Treasuries. Benchmark yields - which move inversely to prices - on German government bonds crept back above 0.5 percent, having been on a sharp slide for most of the month. Spanish yields meanwhile headed for their biggest monthly fall since mid-2016. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was at 2.773 percent after touching a near two-month low of 2.743 percent overnight amid the strains on Wall Street. “I think most of these markets are staring at the 200-day moving average on the S&P 500 to see if it breaks,” said Societe Generale’s Kit Juckes. “I think euro/dollar is stuck in its range with superglue... but I think if there is going to be another surprise in Q2 it will be yen strength again.” Wall Street futures were pointing to a marginally higher open. Shares of the so-called FANG group - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet – were up between 0.60 and 1.6 percent in pre-market trading. All three major U.S. indexes ended in the red again on Wednesday with $30 billion wiped off Amazon’s shares alone after reports U.S. President Donald Trump wanted to rein in the firm’s power in online retailing. Including Apple the FANGs as a set are still up 14 percent so far this year, but privacy concerns in the wake of Facebook’s scandal nearly two week back has wiped $400 billion off their value. The turbulent start to 2018 in financial markets more broadly has brought an end to one of the longest ever quarterly bull runs - and there have been few places to hide. Investors have had it all thrown at them, from the biggest ever rise in stock volatility to rapidly escalating tensions over global trade, deepening turmoil in the White House and major tech sector wobbles.

2018-03-29,"MAI MAHIU, Kenya (Reuters) - Eliud Njoroge and his wife were inside their house in Kenya’s Rift Valley when a crack appeared in the cement floor and started spreading. As they raced out they already knew it was more than a construction fault. Other cracks had started to appear on their town’s main road - a major thoroughfare to the Maasai Mara nature reserve - after weeks of rain, floods and tremors. In the days that followed, geologists started to take full stock of the disaster - a giant fissure, kilometers long, slicing through the road and surrounding countryside - a harsh reminder that Kenya’s majestic Rift Valley, a tourist hotspot, sits on some of the most unstable ground on the continent. “My wife screamed for the neighbors to come and help us remove our belongings,” Njoroge said, remembering when they first noticed the crack in their home in the town of Mai Mahiu on March 18. In the days that followed, the house became so unstable it had to be demolished. Njoroge was left searching for salvage in the piled up bricks and corrugated tin sheets. The couple are still looking for a place to stay. The road was fixed in a day. But the fissure has forced other families to leave and geologists have warned it could spread further with more heavy rains expected over the next two months. “People on the ground should be sensitive especially when it rains. Checking whether there are cracks, ground that is sinking or tremors,” said geologist David Adede.   “The cracks run almost in a straight line so you can project. If you see a crack coming your way, get away,” he added.     In the very long term - over the next tens of millions of years - geologists say the underlying tectonic fault could split the continent in two. In the meantime, geologists have warned that authorities need to do more to take fault lines into account as they plan their new roads, rail lines and infrastructure projects. “They constructed the road without knowing there was a fault line, that’s why the contractors are on standby since they don’t know where the crack is going,” said Adede.

2018-03-29,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - China’s new crude oil futures contract, which began trading this week, has a good chance of confounding the doubters and becoming a regional benchmark where other contracts have failed. The history of futures and options trading is littered with new contracts launched amid great fanfare but which subsequently failed to develop sufficient liquidity and have been discontinued or faded into irrelevance. But the new crude futures contract launched on the Shanghai International Energy Exchange comes after years of meticulous preparation and has many of the ingredients needed to be successful. Three elements determine the success or failure of a new futures contract, according to an extensive literature review prepared for the Shanghai Futures Exchange three years ago. The contract must fulfil a commercial need for hedging. It must succeed in attracting a pool of speculators. And public policy must not be too adverse (“Why some futures contracts succeed and others fail”, Till, 2014). China’s new oil futures contract clearly meets the first two criteria and has a fair chance of succeeding on the third as well. China has already overtaken the United States to become the world’s largest crude importer, so there is a clear need to hedge the resulting price risks. The need for a new contract and its basic features were showcased two years ago in a presentation by China’s leading crude importer (“Review of current and potential Asian oil benchmarks”, Unipec, 2016). China’s refiners import mostly medium and heavy sour crudes, which trade at a substantial discount to lighter and sweeter oils. The two main existing benchmarks, Brent and U.S. light sweet crude, also known as WTI, are based on light low-sulphur crude oils. In contrast, the new Shanghai futures contract is based on a basket of medium and heavy crudes from the Middle East and China itself with a significantly higher sulphur content. The new futures contract approximates the sort of crudes that China is importing much more closely than Brent or WTI. Foreign crudes deliverable against the contract include oils from the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Iraq, which all trade freely. But they also closely resemble other grades China imports in significant volumes, including crude from Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia. The new contract is denominated in yuan rather than U.S. dollars, allowing refiners to manage their price risks more effectively. The contract should have no difficulty in attracting a pool of speculators to provide liquidity since China has a large number of domestic traders and brokers familiar with commodity markets. China has already launched several highly successful contracts, including steel, iron ore and copper, all of which have become liquid benchmarks. There is a large community of domestic speculators and a network of brokerages, which should help the new contract succeed. China has many of the network characteristics that have made Chicago, New York, London and Singapore successful futures trading hubs. The biggest source of uncertainty surrounds the attitude of the government towards price volatility and its willingness to allow fairly unrestricted futures trading. China’s government has not always been comfortable with extreme price swings and high levels of speculative activity, and has periodically intervened in the markets. But the same impulses have been seen in other futures trading centres, at least historically, and China’s regulatory interventions have not prevented the successful development of contracts for other commodities. Given China’s increasing dependence on crude imports and ambition to be a global financial centre, the government has a strong strategic interest in ensuring the new contract becomes a successful benchmark. The new crude contract has some distinctive characteristics and restrictions that have drawn adverse comment (“China aims to challenge Brent, WTI oil with crude futures launch”, Reuters, March 23). There are strict limits on the number of cancelled orders to curb spoofing but which may deter computer-driven high-frequency traders. Trading is restricted to three distinct periods each day, rather than being nearly continuous, and there will be lengthy non-trading periods during national holidays. But most of these restrictions have a sound rationale, including concentrating liquidity, and they are likely to be relaxed as the contract becomes more established. None of them appears likely to deter liquidity. China’s new crude futures are unlikely to displace the Brent and WTI light sweet benchmarks in the United States and Europe. But they have a fair chance of successfully becoming a regional benchmark for the medium and heavy sour crudes favoured by refiners in Asia (“Shanghai crude futures complete globalisation of oil markets”, Reuters, March 28).

2018-03-29,"ORAN, Algeria (Reuters) - When the U.S.-educated CEO of Algeria’s state energy company Sonatrach ended a speech to staff by seeking questions, an executive sitting next to him quickly picked up the microphone. “There are no questions,” he said, and some 1,000 employees filed straight out. The scene revealed the scale of the challenge facing Abdelmoumen Ould Kadour, who took over Sonatrach a year ago with a mission to improve communication and transparency in a company that is central to stability in Algeria and beyond. Sonatrach funds 60 percent of the state budget, and falling oil prices have created pressure for change, while Algeria’s role as a major gas supplier to Europe means new tension between the continent and gas giant Russia could play into his hands. He will soon unveil a plan to lift stagnant output and has revived ties with European oil majors. But project delays, fraud scandals, secrecy and red tape abound in a country where adults remember civil war and change is often resisted. “It’s hopeless,” he confided to colleagues accompanying him to the company office in the northwestern city of Oran, one of dozens of such visits by the 66-year-old alumnus of MIT and Harvard to Sonatrach outposts witnessed by Reuters. On his first day, he said on another occasion, he was given so much paperwork to sign he feared he would do little else. “There was no medium and long term strategy, there was no communication, no coordination between Sonatrach’s executives, every single piece of information was confidential.” No stranger to setbacks, he spent two years in an Algerian jail for collaborating with foreigners after a decade in charge of a joint Algerian-U.S. engineering company co-owned by oil services firm Halliburton. He has brought in his own team to lead the revamp at Sonatrach, declining requests for an interview but sharing his views during his tour of the company. A company source said his turnaround plan would be unveiled “within weeks, if not days”. Designed partly to attract foreign investment, it is likely to come during or before a conference he hosts on April 16-18 which the CEOs of France’s Total(TOTF.PA), Italy’s ENI(ENI.MI) and Norway’s StatoilSTL.OL are expected to attend. His broad goal is to turn Sonatrach into an integrated energy company by 2030 from its current sprawling state, which includes an aircraft maker and extensive social programmes and excludes renewables, which come under the environment ministry. While Western CEOs will expect concrete steps after years of bold announcements, the plan has spread unease among executives, several of whom told Reuters they feared sweeping management changes in Ould Kadour’s declared battle with red tape. In Oran, he told staff that Statoil, set to resume work at the Hassi Mouina gas field, had previously left because of bureaucracy. “Better communication, a better environment is key to convince foreign partners to work in Algeria,” he said. A Sonatrach source said Statoil is expected to invest $500 mln in gas, a figure described by a Statoil source as “speculation”. Last month Statoil and Britain’s BP(BP.L) agreed to strengthen cooperation in upstream oil exploration and explore solar energy to allow Algeria to export more of its gas. In December Ould Kadour revived ties in December with Total, ENI and Saipem(SPMI.MI), but his ability to nurture those relationships and reverse years of stalling production will depend on how his company’s 40,000 employees respond to his message of change. He is an unlikely manager in a country known for secrecy and a suspicion of Westerners dating from ties to the Soviet Union and the trauma of the 1954-1962 independence war with France. But energy revenues have halved since 2014 and President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the 81-year old leader who might run for a fifth term next year, is struggling to maintain a welfare state necessary for social stability. The government has launched austerity measures, banning the import of 900 goods and freezing public sector hiring and development projects. Doctors and teachers have been on strike in several cities for three months demanding better pay and conditions and the state has been unable to end dissent by paying out as it did when a barrel of crude cost $100 instead of $70 as now. This has turned improving the efficiency of the state oil company into a political imperative. “Ould Kaddour has no choice but to succeed as Sonatrach’s CEO,” a former energy minister told Reuters. Critics of the CEO say he has only been appointed because of Bouteflika and will last no longer than his many predecessors. “If Bouteflika quits, Ould Kaddour would be sacked in the next five minutes,” a former Sonatrach executive said. With the presidential election looming, Ould Kadour has sought to cut Algeria’s import bill by recruiting oil trader Vitoil to swap crude for the petrol in growing need at home. “The strategy was to show that Algeria, which is a big oil producer, is not spending gigantic sums on imports of products,” an oil insider said. One delayed gas field was brought online last year with three more slated to start producing this year, lifting annual gas output of 94 billion cubic metres by 9 billion cubic metres. Sonatrach has signed a $1 billion deal with Turkey to build a petrochemical facility, discovered crude in Niger and explored cooperation with Iraq. It is also considering shale, but protests in 2015 from Algerians fearing environmental damage have made that politically unpalatable for now. In further signs of a balancing act, company sources say Sonatrach will offer more flexible short-term gas contracts on terms of 10-15 years or less instead of 20-25 and invest $250 million in the Tinhert gas field project using Algerian firms. Ould Kadour’s sentencing by a military court in 2007 on charges working for a foreign country was part of an internal regime conflict typical for Algeria, observers say. An elite made up of the ruling FLN party, army and security has controlled Algeria since independence, with officials or executives of state firms sometimes losing jobs when a new faction takes over in power plays behind closed doors. After serving his two-year jail term, he worked in Qatar, France, Senegal and the United Arab Emirates before Bouteflika made him Sonatrach CEO in March 2017. Anis Rahmani, owner of private Ennahar TV station, said the CEO had told him he was devastated by being branded a traitor. “But the man has vision, a plan to transform the company into a modern and performing one, which is not the case now,” he said. He is more powerful than the energy minister, one insider said, but must also win backing from politicians resistant to opening up the country too much. A key energy law has been stalled for years but a draft is now due in July. It is likely to retain Sonatrach’s majority stake in all energy projects but offer tax incentives for investors, a Sonatrach executive said. “The law needs to be attractive,” he said. “If not it will be useless.” Additional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov in LondonEditing by Ulf Laessing and Philippa Fletcher",https://uk.reuters.com/article/algeria-energy/insight-u-s-trained-engineer-takes-on-algerias-energy-monolith-idUKL5N1QR23Y,29 Mar 2018,"When the U.S.-educated

2018-03-29,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq will exclude oil by-products from foreign oil companies’ revenues in new contracts expected to be awarded in June, an oil ministry official said on Thursday, effectively reducing production fees they receive from the government. Oil producers in Iraq currently receive a fee from the government linked to production increases, which include crude and oil by-products such as liquefied petroleum gas and dry gas. OPEC’s second largest producer after Saudi Arabia decided to change the contracts after a glut caused oil prices to crash in 2014, reducing the government’s ability to pay the fees. Iraq has invited foreign companies to bid for contracts to explore and develop petroleum reserves in 11 new blocks as it seeks to boost output capacity. The new terms, announced at a press conference by Abdul Mahdi al-Ameedi, head of the ministry’s licensing and contracts office, include other provisions which will reduce companies’ profit. The new contracts will ‘establish a linkage between prevailing oil prices and cost recovery’, Ameedi said. They will also introduce a royalty element, he added. Companies including BP (BP.L), Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Eni (ENI.MI), Total (TOTF.PA) and Royal Dutch Shell  (RDSa.L) helped grow production in the past decade by over 2.5 million barrels per day to about 4.7 million barrels per day. The semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government produces oil and gas from fields under its control in northern Iraq under a production sharing model more profitable to companies. The new contracts offered by Baghdad will also set a time limit for companies to end gas flaring from oil fields they develop on territory under its control. Iraq continues to flare some of the gas extracted alongside crude oil at its fields because it lacks the facilities to process it into fuel for local consumption or exports. Iraq hopes to end gas flaring by 2021, which costs nearly $2.5 billion in lost revenue for the government and would be sufficient to meet most of its unmet needs for gas‐based power generation, according to the World Bank.

2018-03-29,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) will buy back new diesel cars if German cities ban them, it said on Thursday, seeking to reassure potential buyers and stem a plunge in sales of diesel vehicles.  Europe’s biggest automaker also said it would extend incentives for buyers of new diesel cars. The moves come after a German court ruled last month that cities in the country could ban the most polluting diesel vehicles from their streets. Many German cities exceed European Union limits on atmospheric nitrogen oxide, known to cause respiratory diseases.      Fears of bans have led to a plunge in demand for diesel vehicles, which are also key to carmakers’ attempts to meet new EU rules on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. While diesel cars are heavily criticized for emitting nitrogen oxide, they spew out less CO2 than gasoline equivalents. Diesel car sales plunged 19 percent in Germany last month. At its core VW brand, Volkswagen said its buyback offer applied to new diesels bought between April 1 and the end of 2018 and would kick in if the city in which the buyer lived or worked banned diesels within three years of the purchase. It said its dealerships would buy back diesel vehicles affected by bans at their current value if their owners at the same time bought a new vehicle that was not affected by cities’ driving restrictions. At Czech brand Skoda, the guarantee applies to cars bought between April 1 and the end of June, but will cover bans introduced within four years of the purchase date.  At premium brand Audi, the offer only covers leased vehicles. Volkswagen also said it was extending to the end of June incentives for customers trading in older diesels for new ones. Fellow German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) said earlier this month it would offer to take back leased vehicles if diesels were banned within 100 kilometers (62 miles) of the operator’s home or place of work. There has been a global backlash against diesel-engine cars since Volkswagen admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. exhaust tests.  But Germany’s government is seeking to avoid widespread bans on heavily polluting diesel vehicles, which companies say could cut the resale value of up to 15 million vehicles in Europe’s biggest car market. In Germany, where motorists expect to drive powerful cars on motorways with no speed limits, any restrictions will be unpopular. Yet air quality is also a big concern, with green and consumer groups pushing for action.

2018-03-29,"(Reuters) - U.S. environmental group the League of Conservation Voters on Thursday launched a $2 million campaign to press this year’s candidates for state and local office to embrace clean energy, citing a lack of leadership on the issue in Washington. The effort seeks to tap into increasing local-level leadership on climate change since President Donald Trump took office on a vow to roll back environmental regulation and promote fossil fuels production. “Change is happening at the state level,” Bill Holland, state policy director for the League of Conservation Voters (LCV), said in an interview. “What we want to do is get elected officials and local officials committed to big clean energy plans.”      Holland said the “Clean Energy for All” campaign will seek to secure commitments from local candidates for office to move their states to 100 percent clean energy, and support ballot initiatives to expand their renewable energy portfolios. Many U.S. mayors and governors are already implementing climate-friendly policies to counterbalance the Trump administration’s rejection of Obama-era initiatives to curb carbon emissions - which Trump has said would cost trillions of dollars with little tangible benefit. LCV said its local-level strategy appeared to work last year, when it pushed New Jersey candidates for governor to make clean energy commitments. Democrat Phil Murphy, who ultimately won, committed during the campaign to move the Garden State toward 100 percent clean energy. Holland said the clean energy effort is also aided by the fact that the cost of wind and solar energy has fallen in recent years, making those technologies competitive with electricity fueled by coal or natural gas.  “We are in this whole new world where clean energy makes sense regardless of your politics and regardless of the discussion around climate,” Holland said.     The clean energy push comes in addition to LCV’s previously announced decision to spend some $20 million on state-level races this election cycle to push its broader environmental agenda - a figure that is nearly double its previous record for investment in local elections. The Washington-based group said it will leave it up to individual state organizations to define what precisely falls under the umbrella of “clean energy” - though fossil fuels including natural gas will be excluded.

2018-03-29,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Catherine Ngai NEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters) - Three firms that bought crude oil last year from U.S. emergency stockpiles raised concerns about dangerous levels of a poisonous chemical in the cargoes, according to internal Energy Department emails and shipping documents reviewed by Reuters. Problems with crude quality would make the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) less useful in an emergency because refiners would need to spend time and money removing contamination before producing fuel. The reserve is the world’s largest government stockpile, currently holding 665 million barrels. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) occurs naturally in crude and natural gas, but oil producers typically decontaminate such products before delivery to buyers. High levels of H2S can corrode refinery parts and pipelines - and can be lethal to humans in gas form. Authorities in all major consuming countries keep oil in reserve to ensure that they do not run out of crude to refine into fuels if a natural disaster or war disrupts global supplies. The U.S. government established its reserve in 1975 following the Arab oil embargo. The U.S. Department of Energy oversees the reserve and periodically sells some of its oil at times when there are no emergencies, as it did with the sales that sparked contamination concerns. Department Spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes declined to comment about the contamination complaints uncovered by Reuters. The three firms that raised concerns about high H2S levels were Royal Dutch Shell Co, Australian bank Macquarie Group and PetroChina International America, the U.S. trading arm of state-owned energy firm PetroChina Co Ltd, according to the shipping documents, emails provided by the Energy Department in response to a public records request, and a department official who declined to be identified. The department took responsibility for cleaning the shipment to PetroChina with an additive after it determined in May of last year that levels of H2S were too high, according to the department official. The department disputes tests showing levels were too high in the other two cargoes, the official said. All three firms bought cargoes of SPR oil stored in an underground salt cavern in Bryan Mound, Texas last year. The oil was pumped from Bryan Mound through pipelines to the nearest oil terminal at Freeport, Texas before being loaded onto ships, according to records reviewed by Reuters and the department official. The Freeport facility is owned by Houston-based Enterprise Products Partners LP. Enterprise knew about higher levels of H2S in a small number of cargoes traded between private firms that passed through its terminal, Enterprise Senior Vice President Brent Secrest told Reuters in an interview. “Of the hundreds of cargoes we’ve loaded across Freeport and other Enterprise terminals, we’ve only had a handful of customers give us feedback regarding high levels of H2S,” he said. In March, Shell complained to the Energy Department after finding high levels of H2S in a cargo the company bought as part of a 6.2 million-barrel purchase from the U.S. government in January, according to emails provided by the department in response to the Reuters public records request. The firm was “unpleasantly surprised” to find the high levels, Shell oil trader Steve Sellers wrote to the department, adding that the issue caused concern at Shell about the quality of SPR crude for future purchases. Shell declined to comment on its complaint to the government. The oil firm’s emails said an initial test sample detected H2S gas at levels of less than five parts per million (ppm). But a later test by Shell - after it shipped the crude by boat to another U.S. location - showed H2S levels of 600 parts per million, according to Shell’s emails to the department. Exposure to vapors containing 500-700 ppm of H2S could cause a person to collapse in five minutes and die within an hour, according to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. In November, Australian bank Macquarie Group bought the third shipment from the SPR and sold it to PetroChina, according to the shipping documents reviewed by Reuters. The cargo was loaded at Freeport onto a ship called the Stena Sunrise, the documents show. A testing company named Inspectorate tested a sample from the SPR cargo purchased by Macquarie, according to the documents, and found H2S levels of up to 9,000 ppm. Inspectorate declined to comment and referred questions to the Energy Department. Macquarie declined to comment. After the Inspectorate testing, the terminal operator refused to allow workers to perform additional tests out of concern about violating safety regulations, according to the shipping documents. It is unclear if PetroChina or Macquarie decontaminated the cargo. PetroChina shipped the oil to China, where it arrived on Jan. 18, according to Thomson Reuters shipping data. Reuters was not able to determine how often high levels of H2S are detected across the industry, but industry experts and chemical petroleum engineers said such incidents are rare. Some crude grades can have H2S levels as high as 1000 ppm when produced, said Ramanan Krishnamoorti, chief energy officer and a professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at the University of Houston. But producers remove most of that before transporting crude to customers. Contamination could result from blending different crude grades, for example when one grade of crude is stored in a tank that previously contained a different grade, Krishnamoorti said. “There has to be some concentrated source of it,” Krishnamoorti said. “It’s just very odd.” Reporting by Catherine Ngai

2018-03-29,"* Annual trade in oil worth an estimated $14 trillion * Pilot could be launched as early as the second half of 2018 * Beijing could start with crude purchases from Russia, Angola * Plan coincides with launch of Chinese crude oil futures By Sumeet Chatterjee and Meng Meng HONG KONG/BEIJING, March 29 (Reuters) - China is taking its first steps towards paying for imported crude oil in yuan instead of the U.S. dollar, three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, a key development in Beijing’s efforts to establish its currency internationally. Shifting just part of global oil trade into the yuan is potentially huge. Oil is the world’s most traded commodity, with an annual trade value of around $14 trillion, roughly equivalent to China’s gross domestic product last year. A pilot programme for yuan payment could be launched as early as the second half of this year, two of the people said. Regulators have informally asked a handful of financial institutions to prepare for pricing China’s crude imports in the yuan, said the three sources at some of the financial firms. “Being the biggest buyer of oil, it’s only natural for China to push for the usage of yuan for payment settlement. This will also improve the yuan liquidity in the global market,” said one of the people briefed on the matter by Chinese authorities. China is the world’s second-largest oil consumer and in 2017 overtook the United States as the biggest importer of crude oil. Its demand is a key determinant of global oil prices. Under the plan being discussed, Beijing could start with purchases from Russia and Angola, one of the people said. Both, like China, are keen to break the dollar’s global dominance. Russia and Angola are two of the top suppliers of crude oil to China, along with Saudi Arabia. The move would mark a major step in reviving usage of the currency of the world’s second-largest economy for offshore payments after several years of on-again, off-again measures. If successful, it could also trigger shifting other product payments to the yuan, including metals and mining raw materials. All three sources, who spoke to Reuters on the condition that they not be named, said the plans were at early stages. Officials at some of China’s state oil companies said they had not heard of such plans. The plans coincide with this week’s launch of the first Chinese crude oil futures in Shanghai, which many expect to become a third global price benchmark alongside Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude. Shanghai’s new crude contract is traded in yuan. Besides the potential of giving China more power over global oil prices, “this will help the Chinese government in its efforts to internationalise renminbi (yuan),” said Sushant Gupta, research director at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Unipec, trading arm of Asia’s largest refiner Sinopec , has already inked a first deal to import Middle East crude priced against the newly-launched Shanghai crude futures contract. U.S. bank Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients this week that the success of Shanghai’s crude futures was “indirectly promoting the use of the Chinese currency.” People’s Bank of China (PBOC), the country’s central bank, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the plan. The Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) also declined to comment. China’s plan to use yuan to pay for oil comes amid a more than year-long gradual strengthening of the currency, which looks set to post a fifth straight quarterly gain, its longest winning streak since 2013. The yuan retained its No.5 ranking as a domestic and global payment currency in January this year, unmoved from a year ago, but its share among other currencies fell to 1.7 percent from 2.5 percent, according to industry tracker SWIFT. A slew of measures put in place in the last 1-1/2 years to rein in capital flowing out of the country amid a slide in yuan value has taken off some its shine as a global payment currency. But the yuan has now appreciated 3.4 percent against the dollar so far this year, with solid gains in recent sessions. “For PBOC and other regulators, internationalization of the yuan is clearly one of the priorities now, and if this plan goes off smoothly then they can start thinking about replicating this model for other commodities purchases,” said the person briefed on the matter. It would not be easy, however, for China to shift the bulk of its commodity purchases to the yuan because of the currency’s illiquidity in forex markets. Nearly 90 percent of all transactions in the $5 trillion-a-day currency markets involve the dollar on one side of a trade, while only 4 percent use the yuan, as per a triennial forex survey by the Bank for International Settlements.

2018-03-29,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and Suzuki Motor Corp (7269.T) agreed on Thursday to produce cars for each other in India as Toyota aims to increase its market share in the world’s fifth-largest passenger car market. The agreement follows an R&D tie-up announced by the two Japanese automakers a year ago, and will see Toyota, one of the world’s biggest automakers, secure production from its much smaller rival, which dominates India with its line-up of affordable compact cars. Suzuki will supply gasoline and mild-gasoline hybrid versions of its Baleno hatchback, along with the Vitara Brezza compact SUV to Toyota while the latter will produce gasoline and gasoline-hybrid Corolla sedans for Suzuki, the automakers said.  Analysts said the arrangement would help Toyota expand its presence in India, where it has struggled to grow sales due to lean demand for its lower-cost models. “India is a big blemish on Toyota’s otherwise strong track record for breaking into emerging markets,” said Janet Lewis, head of Asia transportation research at Macquarie Securities.   “By selling rebadged and slightly changed Balenos and Vitaras, Toyota can bolster its distribution network and move more towards expanding its market share.”  Manufacturing will begin by mid-2019. Under the deal, vehicles made by Suzuki will be rebranded and renamed as Toyota cars, while the Toyota vehicles will sport the Suzuki badge. A Toyota spokeswoman declined to give details on production figures, while the Nikkei business daily reported that Toyota would supply around 10,000 vehicles to Suzuki, while Suzuki would produce up to 50,000 units annually for Toyota. The deepening partnership between the two automakers will enable Suzuki to tap into Toyota’s R&D firepower to develop lower-emission vehicles and self-driving cars - areas which Suzuki has admitted it is struggling to keep up with. The two companies plan to introduce electric cars in India around 2020. Suzuki has dominated the Indian automobile market through a majority stake in Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (MRTI.NS), the country’s largest automaker, which sold roughly 1.6 million vehicles last year, accounting for every other car sold in the country. Producing 50,000 vehicles for Toyota would represent just a sliver of what Suzuki sold in India in 2017.  Toyota lags far behind with a roughly 5 percent market share. An additional 50,000 units could push Toyota’s annual sales above those of Honda Motor (7267.T) and Tata Motors (TAMO.NS), but it will still lag far behind the top three manufacturers - Suzuki, Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) and Mahindra & Mahindra (MAHN.NS). Last year, Toyota sold roughly 140,000 cars in India, leaving its two plants in the country to operate at about half their capacity of manufacturing more than 300,000 vehicles a year.     Toyota has produced cars specifically for the Indian market for 20 years, but sales have been dented by poor demand of its last two no-frills models made specifically for India, the Etios sedan and the Liva hatchback, which were criticised for compromising on quality and finish to keep costs low. The supply from Suzuki would alleviate pressure on Toyota to develop its own low-cost models for the country under its Daihatsu compact car brand, which has made limited progress in developing affordable, appealing models for emerging markets.  In the past, Toyota had looked to Daihatsu for help to develop affordable, competitive cars in India. But its engineers and parts purchasing managers have told Reuters that establishing supply chains from scratch which can compete with Suzuki’s would be highly time-consuming.

Dinh La Thang, 57, was convicted of “deliberate violation of state regulations on economic management”, his lawyer, Dao Huu Dang, told Reuters. Thang denied wrongdoing, he said. Thang was prosecuted in connection with losses of up to 800 billion dong (24.89 million pounds) in a PetroVietnam investment in Ocean Commercial Joint Stock Bank. Ocean Bank suffered heavy losses and was forcibly taken over in 2015 by the State Bank of Vietnam, the central bank.

In January, Thang was handed a 13-year sentence after being found guilty of “economic mismanagement” at a coal-fired power plant overseen by state-owned energy firm PetroVietnam, of which he was chairman. The People’s Court of Hanoi also handed sentences of between 15 months of probation to 16 years in prison to six other people for their involvement in the case at the trial starting on Monday last week, according to the lawyer and state media.

2018-03-29,"(Reuters) - Oil prices are likely to rise this year thanks to supply disruptions and an OPEC-led deal to limit production, but doubts over the future of compliance with the multilateral agreement and rising U.S. production could stem the upward momentum, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.     A survey of 31 economists and analysts polled by Reuters showed Brent crude LCOc1 would average nearly $64 a barrel in 2018, versus $63 forecast in the February survey, but below the $67.18 average for the benchmark so far in 2018. Brent prices have risen 4 percent this year, supported by a deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers led by Russia to curb output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) through 2018. The price briefly rose above $70 a barrel this week, supported by tension in the Middle East and declining output in Venezuela, one of the group’s largest producers, where economic crisis has cut production to its lowest in nearly 30 years. A sustained drawdown in U.S. inventories also helped push the price up towards $70, a peak last seen in December 2014.  “We view it rather unlikely that OPEC will exit already by mid-year. However, talking about a possible extension of the deal beyond 2018, we are rather sceptical,” Hannes Loacker of Raiffeisen Capital Management said. “We see a big challenge in bringing in Russia once more. Without Russian participation, the will of some other OPEC members may also be abating somewhat.” Saudi Arabia and Russia are working on a long-term pact that could extend controls over world crude supplies by major exporters for many years. “Even if OPEC compliance with pledged supply remains elevated through the balance of 2018, the explosive growth in U.S. shale oil supply accompanied by growth in crude oil export capacity will likely tip the balance towards lower oil prices in the second half,” BNP Paribas analyst Harry Tchilinguirian said. Analysts expect U.S. production to grow by at least 1 million bpd this year. U.S. output now stands at nearly 10.4 million bpd C-OUT-T-EIA, taking it past top exporter Saudi Arabia and within reach of biggest producer Russia.     “The balance between strong production growth in the U.S., on the one hand, and continued restraint by OPEC and Russia, on the other, remains the key factor on the supply side,” said Cailin Birch, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. “On the demand side, emerging Asia will remain the key region for new demand growth.” The International Energy Agency said this month that global oil demand would increase by 6.9 million bpd by 2023 to 104.7 million bpd, boosted by economic growth in Asia and a resurgent U.S. petrochemicals industry.  Analysts said oil prices could also be pushed up by fears of renewed sanctions on Iranian oil exports after the United States threatened to withdraw from a nuclear deal.   U.S. light crude CLc1 will average $59.85 a barrel in 2018, the poll found, up from $58.88 forecast in February.      Elsewhere, the recent launch of China’s yuan-denominated oil futures, which many expect to become a third global price benchmark alongside Brent and WTI, made a roaring start as Western players and Chinese majors eagerly traded the world’s newest financial oil instrument.

2018-03-29,"CAIRO, March 29 (Reuters) - Egyptian officials were counting votes on Thursday after an election set to hand President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi a second term following a crackdown on dissent that removed serious challengers. As ballots are tallied for official results due on April 2, the focus will be on final turnout since Sisi faced no credible opposition. Critics say the contest recalled the kind of vote that kept Arab autocrats in power for decades before the 2011 Arab Spring. The former military commander overthrew Islamist Mohamed Mursi, Egypt’s first freely-elected president, during turmoil in 2013 that followed a popular uprising two years earlier. Sisi was first elected in 2014 with 97 percent of the vote, but with a modest turnout of about 47 percent. Authorities have been desperate to ensure a higher turnout this time around as Sisi sees attendance at polls as a referendum on his popularity and seeks a strong mandate to fight militants and push through tough economic reforms. State-run media trumpeted Sisi’s victory early on Thursday after the election predicted a “big turnout”, and radio programmes said that most of the voters were from Egypt’s fast-growing youth. “The people have chosen their president”, the front page of state-run daily al-Gomhouria said. Early indications from sources monitoring the vote, however, suggested turnout could be lower than in the 2014 election. On the first two days of voting, turnout was about 21 percent, two sources monitoring the election said, and a Western diplomat said that late on Tuesday it was between 15 and 20 percent. The two sources said late on Wednesday the turnout figure could be less than 40 percent. Egyptian authorities and media outlets have tried to garner as many votes as possible, telling voters it is their duty, and portraying a failure to vote as betrayal of their country.

2018-03-29,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions fell by 3 percent last year from 2016 levels, largely due to a decline in coal-fired power generation and marking the fifth straight yearly drop, preliminary government data showed on Thursday. Output of the heat-trapping gases in Europe’s second-largest emitter behind Germany fell to 456 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said. Thursday’s data shows Britain’s GHG emissions have fallen 43 percent since 1990, meaning it is more than half way towards meeting a legally binding target to cut its GHG emissions by 2050 to 80 percent below 1990 levels. A breakdown of the 2017 figures showed emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main greenhouse gas blamed for climate change, fell 3 percent to 367 million tonnes. Energy-sector CO2 emissions fell by 8 percent as coal-fired power production dropped, and was replaced by record output from renewables such as wind and solar. Separate provisional data, released by BEIS on Thursday, showed power generation from coal plants fell 26 percent in 2017 to 21.36 terawatt hours (TWh), making up less than 7 percent of Britain’s total electricity supply. Britain plans to close all coal-fired power stations by 2025 unless they are fitted with technology to capture and store carbon emissions. Earlier this month, it also rejected plans for a new open cast coal mine in northeastern England on climate grounds. Gas-fired power generation fell almost 6 percent in 2017, while renewable power generation from wind and solar soared, the data showed. Wind power rose 33 percent to a record 40.9 TWh while solar generation was up 43 percent to a record 2.9 TWh.

2018-03-29,"HANOI, March 29 (Reuters) - A Vietnamese court jailed on Thursday a former Politburo member  for 18 years after he was convicted of financial irregularities at a state-owned enterprise, adding to a 13-year sentence handed down separately in January, state media reported. Dinh La Thang, 57, was found guilty of “deliberate violation of state regulations on economic management”, the official radio Voice of Vietnam news website reported. Calls to Thang’s lawyer went unanswered. Court officials were not available for comment. Thang was accused of wrongdoing in connection with losses of up to 800 billion dong ($35 million) in a PetroVietnam investment in Ocean Commercial Joint Stock Bank. Ocean Bank suffered heavy losses and was forcibly taken over in 2015 by the State Bank of Vietnam, the central bank. Thang, the highest-level politician to have been sentenced for decades, will also have to pay a fine of 600 billion dong ($26.31 million), Voice of Vietnam reported. The Politburo is Vietnam’s top decision-making body. Thang lost his position in the Politburo last year, after he came under suspicion of wrongdoing. In January, Thang was handed a 13-year sentence after being found guilty of “economic mismanagement” at a coal-fired power plant overseen by state-owned energy firm PetroVietnam, of which he was chairman. The People’s Court of Hanoi also handed sentences of between 15 months of probation to 16 years in prison to six other people for their involvement in the case at the trial starting on Monday last week, the report said.

2018-03-29,"* European shares lift gloom after recent tech rout * Dollar steadies as momentum from overnight surge fades * World shares set for first quarterly loss in 2 years * Bond yields, commodity prices edge higher * Japan joins group planning talks with North Korea By Marc Jones LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - Stock markets and other riskier assets steadied on Thursday as investors dusted themselves down after a woeful week for the tech sector, readying for what was set to be the first quarterly drop in global equities in two years. Banks and consumer stocks helped Europe’s main bourses 0.2-0.4 percent higher as the region built on a positive session for Asia’s heavyweight Nikkei, Hang Seng and Chinese markets. For currencies traders, the dollar steadied too after a stronger-than-expected revision to Q4 growth data and hopes a nuclear standoff with North Korea has been averted gave it its largest daily gain in six months on Wednesday. The tentative return of risk appetite and upcoming German inflation data also cooled safety plays like Bunds. Benchmark yields - which move inversely to prices - on German government bonds crept back above 0.5 percent having been on a sharp slide for most of the month. Spanish yields meanwhile saw their biggest monthly fall since mid-2016. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was at 2.773 percent after touching a near two-month low of 2.743 percent overnight amid the strains on Wall Street. “I think most of these markets are staring at the 200-day moving average on the S&P 500 to see if it breaks,” said Societe Generale’s Kit Juckes. “We will see if German CPI numbers (due at 1200 GMT) surprise on the upside... but I think if there is going to be another surprise in Q2 it will be yen strength again.” Wall Street futures were pointing to a marginally higher open. All three major U.S. indexes ended in the red again on Wednesday with $30 billion wiped off Amazon’s shares alone after reports U.S. President Donald Trump wanted to rein in the firm’s power in online retailing. As a set, the FAANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) are still well up for the quarter, but privacy concerns after it was revealed 50 million Facebook users’ data was misused has wiped over $400 billion off the shares’ value in recent weeks. The turbulent start to 2018 in financial markets has brought an end to one of the longest ever quarterly bull runs - and there have been few places to hide. Investors have had it all thrown at them, from the biggest ever rise in stock volatility to rapidly escalating tensions over global trade, deepening turmoil in the White House and major tech sector wobbles. A “melt-up” that sent the MSCI’s world share index up 8 percent in January suddenly melted away. Now the Dow Jones, S&P 500, FTSE Nikkei and scores of other big markets are all down for the year. “We have got to make sure (the market selloff) ...is not too prolonged because the longer this goes the higher the chance it will start to affect the man on street,” said Head of Equities at London & Capital Roger Jones. In Asia overnight, Japan’s Nikkei ended up 0.6 percent, Shanghai closed more than 1.2 percent higher and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng recovered from an early wobble to add 0.3 percent. Helping the mood were media reports that Japan had sounded out North Korea’s government about a bilateral summit, and that Pyongyang had also discussed the possibility of a broader meeting with other global leaders. Beijing had said on Wednesday that North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un had pledged his commitment to denuclearisation at meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The greenback was 0.3 percent lower against the yen - often sought in times of market turmoil and political tensions - at 106.57 yen on Thursday. The greenback had rallied 1.4 percent on Wednesday on perceived progress over the North Korea issue, having set a 16-month trough of 104.560 on Monday. The dollar index versus a basket of six major currencies was flat at just over 90 after reaching a one-week high of 90.147. “Expansionary U.S. fiscal policy should support global trade, but markets will remain attentive to further tensions as the China-U.S. trade saga continues to unfold,” wrote economists at ANZ. The euro was 0.15 percent higher at $1.2332 after losing 0.75 percent on Wednesday. Sterling was flat at $1.4080 after shedding 0.5 percent overnight on news British retail sales fell in March for the first time in five months. It has however had its best quarter since early 2015, and not only against a dollar which is locked in its worst run since the financial crisis, but also versus the euro . In commodities, U.S. crude futures rose 0.4 percent to $64.64 a barrel, partly recovering after dropping 1 percent the previous day when data showed U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly rose last week. Brent climbed 0.3 percent to $69.73 a barrel after losing 0.8 percent on Wednesday. Brent has risen more than 6 percent this month with OPEC and other suppliers expected to continue withholding output for the rest of the year and potentially into 2019. Gold was treading water at $1,323 an ounce. Another sign of the stress in markets is that it is set for its third straight quarterly gain.

2018-03-29,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Three firms that bought crude oil last year from U.S. emergency stockpiles raised concerns about dangerous levels of a poisonous chemical in the cargoes, according to internal Energy Department emails and shipping documents reviewed by Reuters. Problems with crude quality would make the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) less useful in an emergency because refiners would need to spend time and money removing contamination before producing fuel. The reserve is the world’s largest government stockpile, currently holding 665 million barrels. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) occurs naturally in crude and natural gas, but oil producers typically decontaminate such products before delivery to buyers. High levels of H2S can corrode refinery parts and pipelines - and can be lethal to humans in gas form. Authorities in all major consuming countries keep oil in reserve to ensure that they do not run out of crude to refine into fuels if a natural disaster or war disrupts global supplies. The U.S. government established its reserve in 1975 following the Arab oil embargo. The U.S. Department of Energy oversees the reserve and periodically sells some of its oil at times when there are no emergencies, as it did with the sales that sparked contamination concerns. Department Spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes declined to comment about the contamination complaints uncovered by Reuters. The three firms that raised concerns about high H2S levels were Royal Dutch Shell Co (RDSa.L), Australian bank Macquarie Group and PetroChina International America, the U.S. trading arm of state-owned energy firm PetroChina Co Ltd [601857.SS], according to the shipping documents, emails provided by the Energy Department in response to a public records request, and a department official who declined to be identified. The department took responsibility for cleaning the shipment to PetroChina with an additive after it determined in May of last year that levels of H2S were too high, according to the department official. The department disputes tests showing levels were too high in the other two cargoes, the official said. All three firms bought cargoes of SPR oil stored in an underground salt cavern in Bryan Mound, Texas last year. The oil was pumped from Bryan Mound through pipelines to the nearest oil terminal at Freeport, Texas before being loaded onto ships, according to records reviewed by Reuters and the department official.  The Freeport facility is owned by Houston-based Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD.N). Enterprise knew about higher levels of H2S in a small number of cargoes traded between private firms that passed through its terminal, Enterprise Senior Vice President Brent Secrest told Reuters in an interview. “Of the hundreds of cargoes we’ve loaded across Freeport and other Enterprise terminals, we’ve only had a handful of customers give us feedback regarding high levels of H2S,” he said. In March, Shell complained to the Energy Department after finding high levels of H2S in a cargo the company bought as part of a 6.2 million-barrel purchase from the U.S. government in January, according to emails provided by the department in response to the Reuters public records request. The firm was “unpleasantly surprised” to find the high levels, Shell oil trader Steve Sellers wrote to the department, adding that the issue caused concern at Shell about the quality of SPR crude for future purchases. Shell declined to comment on its complaint to the government. The oil firm’s emails said an initial test sample detected H2S gas at levels of less than five parts per million (ppm). But a later test by Shell - after it shipped the crude by boat to another U.S. location - showed H2S levels of 600 parts per million, according to Shell’s emails to the department. Exposure to vapors containing 500-700 ppm of H2S could cause a person to collapse in five minutes and die within an hour, according to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration.         In November, Australian bank Macquarie Group bought the third shipment from the SPR and sold it to PetroChina, according to the shipping documents reviewed by Reuters. The cargo was loaded at Freeport onto a ship called the Stena Sunrise, the documents show. A testing company named Inspectorate tested a sample from the SPR cargo purchased by Macquarie, according to the documents, and found H2S levels of up to 9,000 ppm.  Inspectorate declined to comment and referred questions to the Energy Department. Macquarie declined to comment. After the Inspectorate testing, the terminal operator refused to allow workers to perform additional tests out of concern about violating safety regulations, according to the shipping documents. It is unclear if PetroChina or Macquarie decontaminated the cargo. PetroChina shipped the oil to China, where it arrived on Jan. 18, according to Thomson Reuters shipping data.   Reuters was not able to determine how often high levels of H2S are detected across the industry, but industry experts and chemical petroleum engineers said such incidents are rare.  Some crude grades can have H2S levels as high as 1000 ppm when produced, said Ramanan Krishnamoorti, chief energy officer and a professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at the University of Houston. But producers remove most of that before transporting crude to customers. Contamination could result from blending different crude grades, for example when one grade of crude is stored in a tank that previously contained a different grade, Krishnamoorti said. “There has to be some concentrated source of it,” Krishnamoorti said. “It’s just very odd.” Reporting by Catherine Ngai; Editing by David Gaffen, Simon Webb and Brian Thevenot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-oil-contamination/exclusive-firms-complain-of-contaminated-crude-from-u-s-reserve-idUKL1N1OT0V6,29 Mar 2018,"Three firms that bought crude

2018-03-29,"* Crude up as OPEC/non-OPEC deal to hold through 2018 * But rising U.S. crude inventories, production cap prices * Shanghai crude futures down almost 10 pct since Monday launch By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, March 29 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday as the producer cartel OPEC and other suppliers look set to continue withholding output for the rest of the year and potentially into 2019. U.S. WTI crude futures were at $64.57 a barrel at 0242 GMT, up 19 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their previous settlement. Brent crude futures were at $69.72 per barrel, up 19 cents, or 0.3 percent. The Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) together with a group of non-OPEC producers led by Russia in 2017 started cutting output in order to rein in oversupply and prop up the market. Brent, off which OPEC prices most its crude exports, has risen by around a quarter since then, which has lead to speculation that the restraints on production may be lifted. But sources at OPEC told Reuters this week that the group and its allies were set to keep their deal on cutting production for the rest of 2018. “OPEC is in no rush to re-evaluate whether or not it should change the current production caps at the June meeting and may wait till later this year,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader. Despite this, Brent remained below $70 and WTI under $65 per barrel, weighed by rising crude inventories and production in the United States. Commercial U.S. crude inventories rose by 1.6 million barrels in the last week C-STK-T-EIA to 429.95 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday. U.S. crude oil production hit a fresh record, at 10.43 million barrels per day (bpd) C-OUT-T-EIA. That puts the United States ahead in output of top exporter Saudi Arabia. Only Russia pumps out more, at 11 million bpd. In China, Shanghai crude oil futures opened Thursday’s morning session down nearly 2 percent, pushing the new market to parity with U.S. prices. That implies a disconnect between financial and physical crude markets, as U.S. crude has been exported to China profitably for the last two years. The latest drop takes the fall since the contract’s launch on Monday to 10 percent. Reporting by Henning Gloystein

2018-03-29,"KUALA LUMPUR, March 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Over the last decade, pressure from consumers and green groups has pushed big companies that produce, trade or buy palm oil to tackle labour abuses on plantations and commit to ending deforestation that is contributing to climate change. Yet the small farmers who grow close to half the fruit that yields the edible oil in major suppliers Malaysia and Indonesia have been largely left out of efforts to make the industry greener and more ethical, industry officials say. Here are some facts about palm oil and the debate around it: * Palm oil has been consumed as a foodstuff for as long as 5,000 years. * The oil palm tree originates from West Africa where it grows in the wild. Palms can grow taller than 60 feet (18.3 m). * Oil palms were introduced to Malaysia by the British in the early 1870s as an ornamental plant. * Oil palms start bearing fruit about 30 months after being planted, and are productive for the next 20 to 30 years. * Palm oil is used in a wide range of food and household products, from biscuits, ice-cream and chocolate spreads to soaps and cosmetics, as well as in biofuels. * India, China, Indonesia and Europe are the main consumers of palm oil. * Palm trees produce four to 10 times more oil than other vegetable oil crops per unit of cultivated land. * Global palm oil production was estimated to be about 65 million tonnes in 2017. * Indonesia and Malaysia produce about 90 percent of the world’s palm oil supplies. Other growing nations include Thailand, Ecuador, Nigeria and Ghana. * About 40 percent, or 5.6 million hectares, of the total area of land planted with oil palm in Indonesia and Malaysia is owned by smallholders. * Across Indonesia and Malaysia, 4.5 million people earn their living from palm oil production. * Palm oil output in the top-two producing nations was forecast to climb to new highs this year as it recovered from a 2015 El Nino weather pattern, pushing average prices for 2018 down by 7 percent from 2017 to $676.30 a tonne, according to a Reuters poll in January. * In some regions, the clearance of land for oil palm cultivation has caused - and continues to cause - deforestation, despite pledges by big companies to end it. * The palm oil industry has been blamed by activists for slash-and-burn forest clearing that causes an annual haze across parts of Southeast Asia. * The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is an industry body of consumers, green groups and plantation firms that aims to promote the use of certified sustainable palm oil products, and is backed by many major European palm oil buyers. * Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Britain have either already met or are on track to deliver on a commitment to use 100-percent sustainable certified palm oil by 2020. * An estimated 60 percent of palm oil used for food in Europe in 2016 was certified sustainable palm oil. * Europe’s lawmakers approved draft measures earlier this year to reform the EU power market and cut energy consumption to meet more ambitious climate change goals. The plan includes a ban on the use of palm oil in motor fuels from 2021. * Italian confectionery firm Ferrero, which makes hazelnut and chocolate spread Nutella, has publicly defended palm oil after European authorities listed the oil as a cancer risk.

2018-03-29,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany must do all it can to avert driving bans for diesel cars, the country’s new finance minister said in an interview published on Thursday, urging cities and local communities to boost investments in charging stations for electric cars. In an interview with the Funke Mediengruppe newspaper chain, Olaf Scholz expressed scepticism that changes in taxation - for instance, scrapping tax breaks for diesel as a fuel - would speed moves by the car industry to introduce cleaner cars. He also rejected calls for the government to offer financial incentives to get more clean-burning diesel cars on the road and bring down emissions in heavily polluted cities. “It is the task of industry to develop vehicles that meet existing and future rules for clean air,” Scholz told the newspaper group, adding: “We must talk seriously about how we can get more electric cars or expand public transportation.” Scholz, who owns a diesel car himself, said he shared other drivers’ concerns about limited access to certain areas in the future, if driving bans were imposed. “We must do all we can to prevent driving bans for diesel vehicles,” he said. Instead, he said cities and local communities seeking to reduce overall emissions should build more charging stations to promote use of electric cars and buses, and the car industry should accelerate its work on clean car technologies. “Industry must deliver now. It would be good if such a technological advance came from Germany.” Scholz, a Social Democrat, joined conservative Transportation Minister Andreas Scheuer and Chancellor Angela Merkel in speaking out against comprehensive diesel driving bans. Merkel last week told lawmakers she favoured tailored solutions to bring down car emissions in heavily polluted cities.

2018-03-29,"* MSCI Asia-Pacific index up 0.1 pct, Nikkei gains 1 pct * Perceived easing of N.Korea tensions seen supporting sentiment * Tech-led losses on Wall Street limit equity gains * Yen sharply lower vs dollar By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, March 29 (Reuters) - Asian stocks edged up and the safe haven yen was broadly lower against the dollar on Thursday amid perceived progress on North Korea issues, although equity gains were limited after a tech-led retreat on Wall Street. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.05 percent. Australian stocks dipped 0.1 percent, Japan’s Nikkei rose 1 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI added 0.1 percent. Wall Street closed lower after a rocky session on Wednesday as gains in consumer staples and healthcare were offset by a sharp drop in Amazon shares and a continuing slide in technology stocks. “Fears of a global trade war have eased, although concerns still linger about the U.S. technology sector,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. “But equities in Asia will receive support from an easing of tensions regarding North Korea, with countries like Japan seeking a summit,” Ichikawa added. Japan has sounded out the North Korean government about a bilateral summit, and Pyongyang has discussed the possibility of a leaders’ meeting with Japan and other countries, Japan’s Asahi newspaper said on Thursday. North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un pledged his commitment to denuclearisation and to meet U.S. officials, China said on Wednesday after his meeting with President Xi Jinping. The yen, often sought in times of market turmoil and political tensions, retraced its gains against the dollar. The greenback was steady at 106.860 yen after it rallied 1.4 percent on Wednesday, pulling away from a 16-month trough of 104.560 set on Monday. With fears of a worldwide trade war receding, the dollar also gained against other currencies. The dollar index versus a basket of six major currencies was at 90.068 after reaching a one-week high of 90.147. Global markets were shaken this month when U.S. President Donald Trump moved to impose tariffs on Chinese goods and Beijing threatened similar measures. But fears of a full-blown trade war have eased on hopes that negotiations can bring a compromise. The euro was a shade lower at $1.2305 after losing 0.75 percent on Wednesday. Sterling was flat at $1.4077 after losing 0.5 percent overnight on data showing British retail sales fell in March for the first time in five months. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was at 2.786 percent after touching a near two-month low of 2.743 percent overnight on sagging Wall Street shares. In commodities, U.S. crude futures rose 0.5 percent to $64.70 a barrel, partly recovering after dropping 1 percent the previous day when data showed U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly rose last week.

2018-03-29,"(Repeats Wednesday’s article with no change to text) By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, March 28 (Reuters) - China’s launch of a crude oil contract this week on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) allows investors for the first time to take advantage of differences in supply-demand dynamics across world oil markets. Oil markets have until now been dominated by two financial futures instruments: U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Europe’s Brent crude. WTI is the main benchmark for U.S. crude grades and a crucial hedging tool for the U.S. oil industry. Brent, priced off North Sea oil, is the primary value marker for Europe, Middle East and African crudes. Both are used extensively by industry and financial traders. Asia so far has lacked a financial instrument despite its position as the world’s biggest and fastest-growing oil consumer. Previous attempts to establish one have been made in Singapore, Japan and Dubai, but have not been widely taken up. Shanghai crude futures may have done the trick, though, if traded volumes this week hold beyond initial enthusiasm. Success in Shanghai would mean the three main global oil markets - Asia/Pacific (APAC), Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and the Americas (AMERS) - each have a benchmark reflecting their distinct supply-demand drivers. China’s oil demand makes up more than a quarter of Asian consumption and nearly a tenth globally. “Hopefully, it (Shanghai crude) gets a lot of traction and we end up with three established global benchmarks,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader. One of the main attractions of having globally available crude oil futures is for financial traders to take advantage of regional prices without investing in physical oil or operating assets such as tankers, oil fields or refineries. Investors typically take advantage of differences in cross-regional prices through arbitrage trading. Before this week, the primary means of doing this in crude markets was via a financial product CL-LCO1=R based on the Brent-WTI price spread. In EMEA, Brent futures are heavily influenced by output policy from the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), as well as by Russia, the world’s biggest oil producer. Since both OPEC and Russia have been withholding production since 2017 to prop up prices, the spread currently reflects a premium that Brent holds over WTI. In the Americas, meanwhile, U.S. oil production has jumped by a quarter since mid-2016 to 10.4 million barrels per day (bpd) C-OUT-T-EIA, further supporting the Brent-WTI gap. Now, investors can also trade the arbitrages between China and the rest of the world. It would have been profitable this week, for example, to “buy the spread” between higher-priced Brent and lower-priced Shanghai by going long in the European contract and shorting Asia’s as the spread widened from $1.60 a barrel on Monday to $4.60 on Wednesday. That means closing the positions would have gained an investor $3 per barrel. A spread can be sold as well. Had a trader gone short Shanghai but long lower-priced WTI, it would have yielded a gain of $2.80 a barrel, as the gap between the two narrowed from $3.10 a barrel on Monday to just 30 cents on Wednesday. Buying WTI while selling Shanghai would effectively replicate in financial markets the surge in actual U.S. crude exports to China seen in the last two years. Crude futures also offer industry participants like oil producers and petroleum refiners the chance to protect their assets through what is known as hedging. So far, this has been done through the U.S. and European benchmarks. A Chinese refiner importing Middle East crudes - which are mostly priced off Brent - and needing to protect itself from a sudden jump in prices for those grades, would typically buy Brent futures. That way, losses from higher raw material costs can be mitigated by gains made in the European crude futures. Now, the Shanghai contract offers risk control strategies better reflecting local demand and supply. Should Chinese fuel demand fall and dent the refinery’s sales that would likely also pull down Shanghai crude futures. A short position in Shanghai futures would profit from the decline, offsetting at least some of the drop in revenue the refiner would see in its petroleum sales. Oil producers, by contrast, need to protect crude output from falling prices. Thus, a U.S. shale producer selling into Asia could take a short position in Shanghai to offset any drop in income from physical crude sales if demand and prices unexpectedly fall off in Asia.

2018-03-29,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text) * Vitol seen storing gasoline off Singapore * Oversupply despite refinery maintenance/outages * Singapore onshore light distillates stocks at record levels By Seng Li Peng SINGAPORE, March 28 (Reuters) - European trader Vitol is storing gasoline on tankers offshore Singapore, Asia’s biggest oil trading centre, for the first time since 2016 amid oversupply and weak demand for the fuel, said four people that participate in the market on Wednesday. The sources said that Vitol was seen storing gasoline aboard more than one so-called Long-Range (LR) tanker. The company does not typically comment on its trading operations. At least one of the vessels is the tanker Glory Crescent, a so-called LR-2 tanker, said one of the four sources. The vessel is 105,000 deadweight tonnes and could carry the equivalent of about 800,000 barrels of gasoline. According to data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, the Glory Crescent was fixed on Feb. 27 by a charterer that was not revealed for a one- to two-month time charter for storage. The Aframax LR-2 vessel is currently at anchor offshore the city-state, the data show. Since the start of 2018, gasoline market has been in a contango structure, where front-month prices are lower than later-dated prices which is indicative of a weak market. This month, the contango between March and April prices widened to as much as 50 cents a barrel. Typically, traders can store fuel in a contango market in expectation of the later rising prices, but the current contango does not justify, according to the sources. “The contango is not wide enough to encourage storing gasoline but Vitol may have its own economics for doing so,” said one of the sources. In 2016, traders including Vitol, Unipec, Total and Gunvor were storing gasoline aboard vessels off Singapore as the contango deepened to $1 a barrel. So far, Vitol is the only company storing fuel, the sources said. They were not expecting more to follow suit, although the market remained saddled with supplies despite recent refinery outages in Taiwan and ongoing refinery maintenance in North Asia. The latest data from Singapore’s International Enterprise (IE) showed that onshore light distillates stocks held in the week to Tuesday were at a record of 15.635 million barrels. Over in Europe Gunvor, Litasco, Trafigura, Socar as well as Vitol had already used vessels to store gasoline this month following slow demand for petrol from the United States. “Refinery runs in the Atlantic Basin are at elevated levels, despite turnaround activities ... This had a cascading effect on Singapore cracks as the U.S. still sets the tone for regional gasoline cracks,” said Sri Paravaikkarasu of FGE. Overall, gasoline demand in Asia this year is expected to lag 2017, she added. The gasoline crack refers to the profit from refining a barrel of oil into petrol.
